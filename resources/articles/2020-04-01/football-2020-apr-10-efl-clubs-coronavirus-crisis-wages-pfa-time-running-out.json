Talks are continuing between the EFL, clubs and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association on how best to stem the financial losses brought about by the coronavirus crisis. Time is running out, however, with many clubs, particularly in Leagues One and Two, set to face severe problems without an agreement on player pay. In the past week some clubs have come to an arrangement. League One\u2019s Sunderland and the League Two side Crewe Alexandra have agreed to furlough their playing staff under the government\u2019s job retention scheme, and the Championship side Millwall are expected to follow suit. The PFA is believed to be supportive of other clubs doing the same, provided wages are topped up to their full extent by clubs. For many Championship clubs, where the wage bill can exceed annual revenue, this would not be a practical solution. On 18 March the EFL announced it would advance \u00a350m in TV revenue to help struggling clubs cover that month\u2019s payroll. Since then the Premier League announced it too would advance monies, a total of \u00a3125m in solidarity and \u201cparachute\u201d payments that would otherwise have been paid next season. In a letter to clubs this week, however, the EFL chairman, Rick Parry, said he would not be transferring that money to clubs now \u201cwhile additional clarity is sought on other financial matters, particularly in respect to player wages\u201d. Elsewhere in his letter Parry laid out plans to finish the Football League season in a sharp burst, playing 341 fixtures over 56 days from June. On Friday this idea was criticised by the head of the League Managers Association, Richard Bevan, who said coaches had not been consulted. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get the support of the coaches and managers,\u201d Bevan told the BBC. \u201cYou do not do that by not talking to them. You do not get the end product or working together if you just send a letter out without actually taking their advice or thoughts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
