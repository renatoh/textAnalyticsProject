Villa chairman Doug Ellis said, in a club statement, that Gregory needed \"to take a break\" and that his departure was \"a reflection of the pressures that managers face in modern day Premier League football\". But only two weeks ago, in the build-up to the FA Cup with Manchester United, Gregory said that he would \"never walk away\" from the club where he was previously a player and a coach under Brian Little. Gregory's apparent disillusionment with some aspects of life at Villa has been growing in recent weeks. He has been continually expressing his disappointment at not being given funds to push home Villa's challenge for a Champions League spot after they went top of the table in late October. Then two weeks ago he was upset following reports that former Holland coach Louis van Gaal was in line to replace him. Ellis took the unusual step of issuing a strong denial of his interest in van Gaal - believed now to be a strong contender to replace Alex Ferguson at Manchester United - but Gregory said that he was \"unconvinced\". There was another blow for Gregory yesterday when Ellis underlined that Villa would not abandon their cautious approach to spending on new players. It remains to be seen whether that was the final straw for Gregory or whether he genuinely needs to take a break from the goldfish bowl of Premiership football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
