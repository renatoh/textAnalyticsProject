The organ, which is the nearest Roman Catholics in this country have to a proper weekly newspaper, has been sounding an uncertain trumpet to the faithful. In the 80s, under Peter Stanford, it swung to the left thanks to an apparent obsession with Latin American guerilla movements, and more recently it has heaved vehemently to the rancorous right, under the eccentric editorship of Catholic convert William Oddie. Now, following his not entirely happy departure, it is hoping to regain its equilibrium under its new, 28-year-old editor - another convert - Luke Coppen. Founded in 1888, the Herald has endured rocky times before. In 1920 its editor went to jail after writing an editorial supporting Irish nationalism. In the second world war, a subsequent editor rejoicing in the title Count Michael de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re nearly ended up behind bars as well, after criticising Winston Churchill for appeasing the godless Soviet Union. More recently, employees have included Auberon Waugh, Patrick O'Donovan, Paul Johnson, Cristina Odone, not to mention several senior current Guardian staff - and Martin Newland, now editor of the Daily Telegraph, but only a decade or so ago a junior reporter on the Herald. The new editor's first task was to announce a different tone from his predecessor, which he did with a prominent article during his first week in charge. Oddie had alienated many Catholics by lecturing them on their shortcomings - something the faithful did not take kindly from an apostate - and by attacking such dangerous liberal subversives as the bishops and the entire order of Jesuits. He also hitched his newspaper to the dubious cause of John Ward, archbishop of Cardiff, subsequently forced into retirement by the Pope (in defiance of the Herald's editorial insistence that he must stay) for shielding two paedophile priests. Maybe worst sin of all, Oddie lost an expensive libel action against a journalist he had blithely and erroneously accused of lying (me, actually). It is rare for an editorial to distance itself quite so firmly from a previous editor, but Coppen's stated boldly: \"I know that in the past some people have choked on the contents of the Herald. They have found it strident, biased or uncharitable ... Under my editorship I want the Herald to be known for the respect and courtesy that it shows to every member of the Catholic Church - bishops, priests and lay people alike.\" Coppen, who started on the paper only five years ago, fresh from Cardiff's journalism training course, has also launched a redesign. He says: \"I think we were seen as slightly angry and we didn't always report the news in a rounded way. Our reporting was influenced by the policies of the paper. We have an ideal opportunity now to break stories and to discover what is really happening in the church.\" In this, the Herald's venerable rivals, the Universe and the Catholic Times, appear to have ceded the field, retreating to Manchester and the north-west in recent years and filling their pages with bland pictures of happy, smiling priests. The Catholic bishops, who formerly effectively owned their publisher, Gabriel Communications, sold their share in controversial circumstances three years ago, but still have a firm grip on the papers' content if a recent memo by Universe editorial director Joe Kelly is anything to go by. According to the leaked memo, seen by the Guardian, Kelly - under whose editorship the Universe's sales have halved in the last 10 years - told his staff: \"It is now formally Gabriel policy that our publications are 100% supportive of the Catholic hierarchy and clergy. This means a shift in our editorial policy which will now seek to present exclusively a positive and constructive picture of the Catholic church in the UK and Ireland as it passes through difficult and challenging times. Where negative news does require reporting this will be done in conjunction with the church and its relavent representatives, in order to minimise negative pastoral consequences and to sustain the faith of our readers. This decision has been made ... for very considered theological and practical reasons.\" These practical reasons may have something to do with Gabriel's ambition to become the church's official publisher - it already publishes the annual Catholic directory, equivalent of the Church of England's Crockford's. Asked at an editorial staff meeting whether the new policy was not a touch Stalinist, Kelly is said to have replied: \"Yes and it's all the better for it.\" The Herald hopes to do rather better than that. Its new chairman, Peter Sheppard - another Catholic convert - who runs a design agency, has ambitions to fill the need for an independent-minded Catholic newspaper by increasing circulation, currently officially 16,000 but insiders say nearer 14,000, to more than 20,000. He says: \"The Catholic community is becoming less working-class demographically. They are going increasingly to move from the Universe to the Herald as they become less tribal and more thinking.\" But like all Catholic publications, the Herald does appreciate that the hierarchy still holds a mighty sway over distribution - and even the lease on its offices, though that apparently is safe. Most copies are sold at the back of church after mass, leaving it vulnerable to the whims of parish priests who may, or may not, approve of its contents. As part of its distancing from the raucous right, the Herald may even be edging cautiously away from its close current links with the Daily Telegraph, several of whose editorial staff moonlight for it as columnists. The paper's two current shareholders are Rocco Forte, who owns 51%, and Conrad Black, who owns the rest but is expected to divest himself of his interest soon. Damian Thompson, a doughty polemicist and Telegraph leader writer who is now the Herald's editor-in-chief, says: \"We don't want the Herald to be identified with any one newspaper, much as we love the Telegraph. We need a period of stability and to move back towards the centre. We are not going to bore the pants off our readers with obsessional campaigns about sex any more. We feel we have got an open field now that the Universe has adopted its new policy, which is a recipe for a Catholic Pravda.\" In a sign of that, the Herald last week led on an interview with Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, head of the church in England and Wales, in which he suggested that priests might eventually be allowed to marry. When the cardinal told me the same thing in an interview for this paper four years ago, Oddie editorialised in the Herald that the Guardian did not know what it was talking about.
