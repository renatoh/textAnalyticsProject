The American president said he would bomb the Syrian regime if it used chemical weapons but he did not follow through on his promise. The failure to enforce his stated \u201cred line\u201d after President Bashar al-Assad used sarin gas in a Damascus suburb in August 2013 is seen by some as the worst stain on Obama\u2019s legacy. The British parliament\u2019s vote against airstrikes has long been cited by Obama and others as a causal factor but Kerry made the link explicit just a week after a diplomatic spat with the UK\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, over a United Nations resolution that condemned Israel. Asked by reporters at a farewell press conference in Washington if the \u201cred line\u201d episode was a nadir of the modern presidency, Kerry argued that the media had not properly analysed, assessed or reported exactly what took place. \u201cThe president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, did decide to use force and he announced his decision publicly and he said we\u2019re going to act, we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to respond to this blatant violation of international law and of warnings and of the red line he had chosen,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we were marching towards that time when, lo and behold \u2026 Prime Minister David Cameron went to the parliament \u2026 and he sought a vote for approval for him to join in the action that we were going to engage in. And guess what, the parliament voted no, they shot him down.\u201d MPs voted by 285-272 to rule out joining US-led strikes, triggering diplomatic shockwaves across the Atlantic. In his unusually frank account, Kerry recalled: \u201cSo as we were briefing Congress \u2013 and I was on one of those briefing calls with maybe a hundred members of Congress on the call \u2013 many of them were saying, \u2018Well, you\u2019ve got to come to us. You\u2019ve got to go through the constitutional process, get permission from us to do something.\u2019 \u201cAnd the president had already decided to use force but then the question became, \u2018Do I need to go to Congress to get that permission?\u2019 \u201cIt was a big debate in the security group. I was part of that, I remember the debate. And we felt that we\u2019d quickly get Congress\u2019s approval because this was such a blatant violation. \u201cI got a call Friday night, we met Saturday morning and the president decided that he needed to go to Congress because of what had happened in Great Britain and because he needed the approval and that was the way we\u2019d do something like that.\u201d In the meantime, Kerry said, he held a press conference in London and was asked if there was anything Assad could do to avoid being bombed. He replied yes, he could agree to get rid of his weapons, and within an hour and a half Kerry received a phone call from Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov suggesting they cooperate on such a deal \u2013 something Obama and Vladimir Putin had previously discussed. \u201cAll of a sudden Lavrov and I were thrown together by our presidents,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cin an effort to try and achieve that and guess what, we did achieve it, before Congress voted. \u201cThe president never said, \u2018I won\u2019t drop a bomb.\u2019 What happened was people interpreted it. The perception was that he was trying to find a different road. And I will acknowledge to you, absolutely, I heard it all over the place. The perception hurt, yes.\u201d He added: \u201cThe perception came about despite the fact that we actually got a far better result of getting all of the weapons of mass destruction out of Syria without dropping a bomb. If we had dropped a bomb, there is no guarantee we would have got any of them out.\u201d Despite the removal of most of the Syrian chemical arsenal, Assad gained strength with Russian and Iran support. The civil war worsened \u2013 its death toll now approaches half a million and a huge refugee crisis continues. Obama\u2019s fateful act of omission is much debated as he nears the end of his presidency. Kerry also parted company with Britain over Israel. Last week, in the wake of a UN resolution that condemned the continued expansion of settlements, Kerry criticised Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government as the \u201cmost rightwing coalition in Israeli history\u201d. A spokesperson for May said: \u201cWe do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally.\u201d That statement prompted a rebuke from Kerry\u2019s state department. There were wrinkles in the relationship with Cameron too. In an interview with the Atlantic Monthly last year, Obama made critical comments about the UK and France regarding their participating in military action in Libya in 2011 that removed Muammar Gaddafi, but failing to stop the country becoming a \u201cmess\u201d. Cameron became \u201cdistracted by a range of other things\u201d, the president said. In the same interview, Obama acknowledged the impact of the British vote on Syria in a decision he made while walking on the south lawn of the White House with his chief of staff. But he said the most important factor was \u201cour assessment that while we could inflict some damage on Assad, we could not, through a missile strike, eliminate the chemical weapons themselves\u201d. \u201cWhat I would then face,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the prospect of Assad having survived the strike and claiming he had successfully defied the United States, that the United States had acted unlawfully in the absence of a UN mandate, and that that would have potentially strengthened his hand rather than weakened it.\u201d This article was amended on 6 January 2017. The headline was clarified to more accurately reflect Kerry\u2019s comments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
