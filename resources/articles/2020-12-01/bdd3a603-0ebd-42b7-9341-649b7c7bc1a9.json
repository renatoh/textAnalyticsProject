The former Labour leader said his Peace and Justice Project would \u201cbring people together\u201d to create \u201ca future that works for the many, not the few\u201d. Corbyn, now sitting as an independent MP after a damaging report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into antisemitism in the Labour party under his leadership, will launch the initiative next month. The project will aim to bring people together to support social and environmental justice, peace and internationalism, and will focus on combating poverty, inequality and unaccountable corporate power, the Islington North MP said. \u201cThe aim of the Peace and Justice Project will be to bring people together for social justice, peace and human rights in Britain and across the world. It\u2019s there to create space, hope and opportunity for those campaigning for social justice and a future that works for the many, not the few,\u201d Corbyn added. Corbyn, who was replaced as Labour leader by Sir Keir Starmer in April, added that his project would promote global cooperation, climate justice, self-determination, democracy and human rights by working with social movements and trade unions to build networks for progressive change. The project will launch on 17 January after an online event featuring the Labour peer Christine Blower, the Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, and the Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Outlining his plans, Corbyn said: \u201cWe will combine research and analysis with campaigning and organising. And we can build on the popular socialist policies developed in the Labour party over the past five years. \u201cThis year, many of us have felt powerless in the face of forces beyond our control. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Things can, and they will, change.\u201d Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, welcomed the initiative saying: \u201cCoronavirus has shown again how neoliberalism is incapable of dealing with the huge crisis our societies face. Now, more than ever, we need to be united in our struggles across the world against neoliberalism and inequality.\u201d Corbyn was suspended from the Labour party after saying the scale of the problem investigated by the EHRC had been \u201cdramatically overstated for political reasons\u201d by opponents and the media. He has since made a clarifying statement saying it was not his intention to \u201ctolerate antisemitism or belittle concerns about it\u201d, and has been readmitted to the party with a warning. However, Starmer has suspended the Labour whip until early next year, requiring Corbyn to make a formal apology."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
