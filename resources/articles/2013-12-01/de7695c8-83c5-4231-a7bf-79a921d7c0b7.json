What I focus on each day is, are we moving the ball on the American people, families, to have a little more opportunity, a little more security \u2026 to feel as though they're moving ahead.\u201d The president acknowledged that the rollout of the healthcare exchanges at the heart of the Affordable Care Act had been his biggest mistake, but insisted it would be forgotten over time as more and more Americans gained access to insurance. \u201cThe fact is, it didn't happen in the first month \u2013 the first six weeks \u2013 in a way that was acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe screwed up.\u201d Some 500,000 Americans signed up to new insurance in the first three weeks of December, the White House claimed. Obama was also forced to defend a last-minute decision to suspend penalties for certain groups uninsured people who had failed to get policies, because of the problems with the online exchanges. He said the administration \u201cjust wanted to make sure that the hardship provision that's in the law\u201d applied to people having trouble in this \u201ctransition\u201d. The president blamed much of the lack of progress this year on key priorities such as gun control and immigration reform on Congress, but predicted that next year might be better following a recent bipartisan deal to pass the budget. \u201cA lot of our legislative initiatives in Congress have not moved forward as we'd like,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship but we are not condemned to endless gridlock.\u201d He also predicted that improving economic conditions would help unlock progress on a host of issues from unemployment to income inequality. \u201cI believe 2014 will be a breakthrough year for America,\u201d said Obama, in an upbeat opening statement about the economy. \"We head into next year with an economy that\u2019s stronger than it was when we started the year. More Americans are finding work and experiencing the pride of a paycheck.\" But the traumas of the past 12 months clearly weighed heavily on the president, who was repeatedly pressed about approval ratings at an all time low. \u201cMy polls have gone up and down at lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was interested in polling I would not have run for president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
