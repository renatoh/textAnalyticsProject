The chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, had spent the afternoon outlining what he called the \"inconsistencies\" in Iraq's weapons declaration to a closed meeting of the security council. In his initial assessments on the declaration, Mr Blix said that a table about biological weapons - submitted previously by Iraq - was not included in its latest report. \"The reasons for the omission need to be explained,\" Mr Blix said. He added after the meeting: \"An opportunity was missed in the declaration to give a lot of evidence. They can still provide it orally, but it would have been better if it was in the declaration.\" Mohamed el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he found little new in the 12,000-page declaration. The comments were based on initial assessments, and both men said they would need more time to review the entire declaration. But Mr Negroponte responded by saying he was disappointed by the Iraqi declaration. \"It fails to address scores of questions pending since 1998, it seeks to deceive when it says Iraq has no ongoing weapons of mass destruction programs,\" he said. He said Iraq was in \"material breach\" of its obligations - diplomatic language that could throw the United States into a war with Iraq. Officials said today that the Bush administration would formally declare Iraq has violated UN security council resolution 1441, setting the United States on a course toward possible war with Saddam Hussein early next year. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision from President Bush would not be an immediate trigger for war - but the beginning of an intense diplomatic campaign to convince allies that the resolution has been violated. Mr Bush is not likely to decide whether to go to war until late January or early February, the officials said, and will use the time until then to bolster his case. But Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said gaps in the declaration were not grounds for war. In Baghdad, Iraqi officials said it was the United States, and not Iraq, that needed to worry about the assessments. \"It's the other party that's worried because there's nothing to pin on us,\" Iraqi general Amir al-Saadi said. He said it was natural UN experts would see little new in the declaration, because Iraq hasn't restarted weapons programs in the time since their last declarations. The Syrian ambassador, Mikhail Wehbe, attended the council meeting but said he would not take part in the discussion, in protest at the 10 non-permanent council members being given a shorter, sanitised version of the Iraqi declaration. Inspectors removed all information that could be used to build weapons of mass destruction as well as the names of companies that sold Iraq supplies. \"As a member of the Arab group, if anything happens to Iraq, we'll be influenced - all the area including Syria as the closest country,\" Mr Wehbe said. \"I will not share in this judgment. Since we did not receive the whole text, how do we judge the report, if it is not complete?\" The White House said Saddam missed his \"last chance\" to come clean with the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
