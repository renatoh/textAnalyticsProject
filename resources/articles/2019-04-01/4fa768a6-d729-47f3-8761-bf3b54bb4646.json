Lori Gilbert Kaye, 60, died in the shooting on Saturday at the synagogue in Poway, 20 miles north of San Diego. County police detained a 19-year-old man after the shooting that injured three, including a little girl, her uncle, and the rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein. \u201cLori took the bullet for all of us,\u201d Goldstein said outside the synagogue on Sunday afternoon, with thick bandages on his hands. Goldstein said he received a phone call from Donald Trump, who emphasized his \u201clove of peace, Judaism and Israel\u201d. Goldstein said he found the call comforting. And an eyewitness told the Guardian that he had confronted the suspect, who was scared and fled. Authorities identified the suspect as John Earnest, who had posted an antisemitic screed online in the form of an \u201copen letter\u201d. San Diego county sheriff William Gore said the teenager could be charged with hate crimes. On Sunday afternoon he was charged with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder. He is also being investigated in connection with an arson attack on a mosque in the nearby city of Escondido in March. Authorities believe the suspect acted alone and that his assault style weapon may have malfunctioned during the attack, preventing further casualties. At a rally on Saturday night Donald Trump said the entire nation \u201cstands in solidarity with the Jewish community\u201d, while the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, said the attack was \u201cyet another painful reminder that antisemitism and hatred of Jews is still with us, everywhere\u201d. The Israeli diaspora minister, Naftali Bennett, described Kaye as \u201ca Jewish hero\u201d who had thrown herself \u201cin the path of the murderer\u2019s bullets to save the life of the rabbi\u201d. Israeli officials also confirmed that two of the wounded were Israeli nationals. Eight-year-old Noya Dahan, and her uncle Almog Peretz, 34, had moved to San Diego a few years ago and were hit by shrapnel during the attack. Lori Gilbert Kaye lived in Poway, and her husband and a daughter witnessed her slaying on Saturday. The rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, in a phone interview with CNN from the hospital, where he had had surgery for wounds to his hands, called her a \u201cwonderful human being\u201d who was constantly helping others. Ariella Lee, a close friend of Kaye and member of synagogue, tearfully paid tribute to her, telling the Guardian: \u201cShe would feed us. She would bring over gifts. I\u2019m sure every single member of my family right now is wearing something that she gave us. She was generous and loving and I hope that we can all be like her because she\u2019s absolutely one of a kind. Words cannot say how wonderful of a person she is.\u201d She added: \u201cWe throw out \u2018generous\u2019 and \u2018loving\u2019 and \u2018kind,\u2019 loosely, and honestly it belittles the words for her, because she\u2019s beyond those things \u2026 She\u2019s the real deal. It hurts so, so much that it was Lori, but to the last moment she was giving.\u201d Many bouquets and notes were left outside the synagogue on Sunday. \u201cWe will build this world from love,\u201d read one sign. Another, with a drawing of the star of David and the outline of tears, said: \u201cMay love, peace and wisdom prevail.\u201d One simple note posted to a utility pole said: \u201cPoway stands with you.\u201d Marie Craig, who described herself as Kaye\u2019s best friend, told the Guardian: \u201cI just cleaned out her car\u2026[there were] gift cards, greeting cards and a basket of gifts, because she\u2019s always wanting to do good.\u201d A vigil is expected to take place at the synagogue on Sunday evening, and Kaye\u2019s funeral will take place there on Monday afternoon. The San Diego county sheriff, William Gore, said Earnest was from the city and had no prior arrests. As the shooter fled, an off-duty border patrol agent inside the synagogue opened fire, missing him but striking his getaway vehicle, Gore said. Earnest called 911 shortly afterward to report the shooting, the San Diego police chief, David Nisleit, said. When an officer reached the man on a roadway, \u201cthe suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody\u201d, Nisleit said. Eyewitness Oscar Stewart, from Rancho Bernardo, a military veteran who fought in Iraq and was worshipping at the celebration for the last day of Passover, told the Guardian how he chased the shooter. He told the Guardian: \u201cI was in the sanctuary and I heard gunshots. I saw him discharge two more rounds \u2026 I ran up to him and I yelled at him and he dropped his weapon and he ran out. He looked scared.\u201d The gun was on a sling around his neck, so it did not fall to the ground, Stewart said. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it. I didn\u2019t think about it. It\u2019s just what I did. He stopped firing. I called him a son of a bitch \u2026 I said \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you\u2019, and I chased him onto the street.\u201d Stewart said the suspect got in his car. An off-duty border patrol officer was at the synagogue, armed. \u201cHe came out and yelled \u2018clear back, I have a gun.\u2019 And so I moved back. I\u2019m glad he was a trained officer. If he had been somebody else I may have been shot.\u201d The officer shot at the car. But the suspect drove off. Stewart went back inside. \u201cI saw the rabbi. He was bleeding from his hands. I immediately went to the lady on the floor and started doing CPR on her. And she didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Others helped try to revive her, then another man rushed over \u2013 who turned out to be Kaye\u2019s husband. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize it was his wife until after he said \u2018she\u2019s not breathing, she\u2019s not breathing.\u2019 And so he went to check her pulse, and when he went to check her pulse he realized it was his wife. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d The sheriff, Gore, said that Stewart \u201crisked his life to stop the shooter and saved lives in the process.\u201d The mayor of Poway, Steve Vaus, said the gunman was \u201csomeone with hate in their heart \u2026 towards our Jewish community and that just will not stand.\u201d The incident came on the last day of Passover and exactly six months since a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people. Gore said investigators were reviewing the suspect\u2019s social media posts and that he was also being investigated in relation to an arsonattack at a mosque last month in Escondido, 15 miles away. A person who identified as John Earnest wrote an online post citing deadly attacks on mosques in New Zealand and Pittsburgh synagogue last year. Abraham Gelebert, from nearby Rancho Bernardo, was dropping off an Uber passenger when he stumbled upon the scene. To him, the blame for such incidents was obvious. \u201c \u201cThis is going to keep happening more and more \u2026 I think it\u2019s the politics of Washington,\u201d he told the Guardian. Behind him, a young woman, in tears, sat staring at the community centre across the street. \u201cThe lack of tolerance. We\u2019re just taking a downslide. Instead of forming better relationships with our neighbours, different races and groups, we\u2019re just steadily going in the opposite direction. Gelebert added: \u201cThe leadership at the top is important, and it certainly doesn\u2019t take much to push those who are already on the edge.\u201d Beyond a change at the White House, he believed there was a need for far stricter gun control. \u201cThe easier it is for people to obtain firearms, especially those that have mental illness, the more likely these incidents are to happen. There\u2019s an undeniable connection,\u201d he said. \u201cThose that refuse to accept that are living on another planet.\u201d Jamiles Lartey, Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
