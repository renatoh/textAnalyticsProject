First, chef forgot to put the honey glazing on the truffle macaroons. Then, a waitress slipped on a tranche of smoked barracuda and fell hard on the marble floor. Emergency services were called immediately, but the wine decanter she had been carrying could not be saved. It was enough to put officials off their seven-course breakfasts for a moment. By the time brunch was served 3.5 minutes later (the waitress was slower than usual for reasons unclear to anyone present), concern had turned to confusion. A rumour was going around that Liverpool, Big Cup holders Liverpool, were in danger of being eliminated from the competition in their last group game. What?! Could this possibly be true? One official scoffed, noting with a reassuring belch that for top clubs the group stages contain about as much jeopardy as a hearty breakfast. Ah. Oh. Everyone agreed this was a strange and irksome day. Meanwhile, RB Salzburg, famously named after the salt mountain in the condiment wing of Uefa\u2019s pantry, continued plotting Liverpool\u2019s downfall. They know their challenge is huge: nothing less than an emphatic victory will do for them against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team. But they are young, super-confident and led by a 19-year-old phenomenon, Erling Braut Haaland, who has predicted a 3-1 win for the Austrian side, with himself netting a hat-trick. No wonder the striker\u2019s teammate J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 said: \u201cIf I had to use one word to describe [Haaland], it would \u2018Ibrahimovic\u2019.\u201d Of course the real Ibra retired several years ago when he went to the USA! USA!! USA!!! Which reminds us that a victory for Salzburg would be a blow not only to Big Cup power-mongers but also to everyone determined to keep patronising Jesse Marsch, the American head coach of the Salzburg Redbulls.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI had a few times good offers from China, but you also need to listen to your heart. I think money is not everything; happiness is something you cannot buy. Inside I feel rich\u201d \u2013 Ajax\u2019s Dusan Tadic gets his chat on with Arthur Renard. RECOMMENDED LOOKING Football and the election: it\u2019s the latest David Squires cartoon. We lost it at Gordon the Gopher. And you can buy a copy right here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan anyone write a more anti-Liverpool hit piece than this utter drivel (yesterday\u2019s Fiver)? Is this what passes for journalism these days is it? Get over yourself\u201d \u2013 Marc Hageman. \u201cFormer Australia manager Ange Postecoglou guided his team to J-League glory last weekend, their first title for 15 years. Now just waiting for the club to announce they\u2019re honouring the achievement by changing their name to Yokohama Flamin\u2019 Marinos\u201d \u2013 James Taylor. \u201cYesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs mentioned some crowd trouble and stadium vandalism at a Cruzeiro game, but didn\u2019t quote its usual source. My heart goes out to the staff of the Fun and Games in South America Dept \u2013 I don\u2019t know how the bigwigs who shoved them through the door marked Has Uno and Fa\u00e7a Um so close to Christmas can live with themselves\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cThe patron saint of Weird Uncle Fiver (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) is surely Saint Cajetan, who has special responsibility for the unemployed, gamblers, odd lot dealers, and job seekers. However, I do worry that I\u2019m flogging a dead horse with this patron saint business \u2026 in which case I\u2019d need to call on St Felix of Nola. There really is a patron saint for everything\u201d \u2013 Richard Morris. \u201cGiven the standard of football analysis and level of humour served up, surely the saint most appropriate for The Fiver is Saint Andgreavsie?\u201d \u2013 Keiron Fulop.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Burnley have confirmed that a 13-year-old fan was ejected for an alleged racist gesture towards Son Heung-min at Tottenham on Saturday. The FA has banned Saif Rubie from Mr 15% duties for improper comments on social media disgraces about Adam Johnson and then the England women\u2019s team. Bolton striker Daryl Murphy has admitted being secretly banned for six weeks last season at Nottingham Forest, having tested positive for jazz salts he took at a trendy nightspot. \u201cI would like to stress that the taking of recreational drugs is something that I don\u2019t condone whatsoever,\u201d he said. Taxpayers FC are keeping faith with Manuel Pellegrini despite their 3-1 gubbing by an underwhelming Arsenal side on Monday. Well, at least until they lose at Southampton. Or beat Saints and effectively sack Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Or draw and both find themselves heading for the same door marked Do One. New Hearts boss Daniel Stendel has hit back at Barnsley over claims they sacked him because he was in discussions with a marriage-wrecking rival Championship club. \u201cI was always honest and documented strongly that I wanted to continue to work with the team in order to achieve the goals of the club,\u201d he sniffed, sounding very much like he believes the Tykes have turned the weans against him. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has urged his team to embrace the directorial work of Stanley Tucci. \u201cI used to love big nights as a player,\u201d he tooted. \u201cI like the pressure of this game being a knockout. If we\u2019re going to do anything good here, then we are going to need lots of these nights.\u201d And Bernard Cribbins is proving the critics wrong at Newcastle, so says Andy Carroll. \u201cIt was obviously topsy-turvy at the beginning,\u201d he trilled. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t really everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but \u2026 seven points in a week is great.\u201d RECOMMENDED LISTENING Come and get your Football Weekly.
