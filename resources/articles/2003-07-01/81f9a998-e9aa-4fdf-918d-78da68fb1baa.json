The latest, Michael Corder's Melody on the Move, slots neatly into a line of revue-style ballets to English music, ranging from Frederick Ashton's Facade to Matthew Bourne's Town and Country. Add the names of David Bintley, John Cranko and Jack Carter and the British choreographic alphabet seems to stop at C. A notable exception is Kenneth MacMillan, whose 1956 Solitaire (to Malcolm Arnold's English Dances) has just been revived for the ENB School performances. What their light entertainment pieces have in common is an approach to ballet as a branch of musical comedy. Fun, provided English tweeness is avoided. Corder and his designer, Mark Bailey, go for the cheesy but gutsy glamour of Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Making their entrance through a giant Bakelite wireless, a chorus line of boys and girls dances to BBC Home Service tunes. Tailcoats and ballgowns give way to boaters, bowlers and full-skirted frocks. Fantasy replaces workers' daytime drabness: secretaries are sex kittens, their boss a golf-playing gigolo, and housewives wear tutus under their pinnies and swoop around the stage on Ewbank carpet sweepers. There's a homage or two to Facade in the waltz for debs and their delights, and a slick duet for po-faced chaps. But in spite of the bright ideas and dazzling steps, something is missing. Corder lacks Ashton's charm and Bourne's warmth. Where they imply a welter of repressed emotions beneath the polite veneer, he is all gloss. The dancers are stuck in their stereotypes, however much they enjoy the chance to show off their sense of humour. Simone Clarke remains a heartless hussy in Marigold gloves, even when she bags the milkman and a baby, and Agnes Oaks is blandly blonde in a Fred and Ginger duet with Thomas Edur, who has no role at all. Corder doesn't pull out enough stops for the the big numbers - the adagio pas de deux, the grand finale - although an indulgent audience is happy to applaud. High-spirited ballet can be more rewarding than this, as Mark Morris demonstrates in Drink to me Only With Thine Eyes at the start of the triple bill. It, too, is a suite of dances to playful music - Virgil Thomson's piano \u00e9tudes. Jonathan Still drives the action from the onstage piano, white-clad dancers floating past him. They make their games with canon and counterpoint look elementary; they don't need to signal how clever they are or what a good time they're having. MacMillan's Rite of Spring, the galvanic closer, turns disciplined dancers into savage forces of nature. As the sap surges through their veins, they turn on one of their own, willing her to die. Erina Takahashi, tiny and wild-eyed, seems terribly alone until her broken body is claimed by the tribe. At the curtain calls, performers and spectators stare at each other, aghast at what we've witnessed. Students from the ENB School revealed MacMillan's ambivalent view of crowd behaviour in his youthful Solitaire. A lonely girl (Amber Dalrymple) longs to be accepted by a group of playmates: they know the rules, she doesn't. They're nice enough to her - they're probably imaginary, anyway. The cast has just the right degree of self-assurance to make her envious. These students (not all of them graduates) are a confident lot and present themselves in an attractive open manner. Antony Dowson's intricate Capriccio teaches them how to dance as an ensemble, making the most of their solo spots. The young men's zest is admirable: British training is at last producing strong male dancers, raring to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
