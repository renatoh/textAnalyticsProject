That's it. Not a great game but what a result for United, who have one foot in the second phase after only two games. Alex Ferguson walks off looking very pleased with himself; you don't have to have much of an imagination to picture it, do you? Last word to Eliot Shephard, whose girlfriend was \"tickled\" by his earlier request: \"How exactly is it a good thing when your girlfriend writes that at times you remind her of a 'dirty old man'?\" 90 min: Forlan skins Ramelow brilliantly to set himself free on the left-hand side of the Leverkusen box... and allows the ball to clank off his shin and into touch. You couldn't script it. 88 min: Solskjaer on for Veron. Leverkusen look abject all of a sudden. 85 min: So unlucky for Berbatov, who rises above Blanc and glances a delightful header past the reach of Barthez and... onto the left-hand post. The ball bounces back along the line and then away to safety. This deserved a goal. 83 min: United pile forward, four on three, but it ends in a terrible shot from Veron, in a blatant attempt to win back his title of 'Most piss-poor South American in the Premiership'. 80 min: United are quite happy to allow Leverkusen to knock it around in front of their packed defence; the Germans aren't going anywhere. The Brazilian striker Franca jogs on in place of Balitsch. 77 min: There's nothing like the sight of Diego Forlan running at defenders with the ball at his feet. No honestly, there's nothing like the sight of Diego Forlan running at defenders with the ball at his feet. 74 min: Berbatov is causing Blanc and Ferdinand no little bother down the centre when he bundles in for high balls, but when he's got the ball to feet with a chance presenting itself, he's far too slow (of mind). Again he allows a clear run at goal to develop into a needless one-on-one with Ferdinand, which the United man wins. 72 min: United are sitting back and leaving it to Forlan, with the sort of results you'd expect: five minutes of nothing. 67 min: Forlan gets the ball but leaves it behind him like a dim puppy. 66 min: Brdaric is clear on the left but takes about 100 touches and Ferdinand slides in to clear. Great tackle, rubbish defending. Anyway, Matt and Charlie eventually leave, and Ashley forgives Maxine. 64 min: Simac on for Ojigwe. \"Last night in New Zealand,\" writes Tony O'Brien, \"Matt told Charlie that Maxine was having his baby. Why not ignore the football and ruin this storyline for me?\" This is Coronation Street, isn't it? Well, I think she turns to the booze in a big way and loses her job teaching (she's shopped by Ken Barlow, which is just the sort of behaviour you'd expect from a friend of Neil and Christine Hamilton). The randy Doctor tells Maxine to leave squeaky Nicky Butt-a-like Ashley, but she refuses. Hold on, there's a chance. 63 min: Balitsch is booked for tugging Forlan to the ground. 60 min: Berbatov jinks in behind the defence and slips in a shot which just goes over the bar. United are presently a shambles. Meantime, Daniel Reilly is on a request tip, as Eliot Shepard might say; he wants some Lynard Skynyrd's Freebird. \"The lyrics If I leave here tomorrow / Would you still remember me? are very applicable to one D. Forlan.\" 57 min: United nearly caught out again as Schneider finds Basturk free and onside in the centre. I say onside because there's a flag. My girlfriend has just emailed to say I have missed the first part of the classic Marisa Tomei two-parter on Seinfeld. 55 min: United are looking very shaky. Barthez goes walkabout down the right to stop a Leverkusen break; Blanc only escapes from a tight spot when he is idiotically fouled. 52 min GOAL Bayer Leverkusen 1 - 2 Manchester United Ah but. Basturk draws two United defenders on the edge of the area and dinks the ball between them to Berbatov on the left-hand edge. Berbatov cuts inside where there is MILES of space - and slips it beyond the advancing Barthez. Game on. 51 min: Sometimes there just isn't anything to say. 47 min: Nothing much happening yet, but I can report that Leverkusen already look like they've given up. Meanwhile, a request from Eliot Shepard: \"Could you send a shout-out NYC-style to my #1 wild-style fab-flava girl Kristen?\" What the hell are you talking about, Eliot? 46 min: We're off again, and with two United substitutions, it promises to be amusing. That's because Forlan is on for Van Nistelrooy. (Gary Neville is the other switch; John O'Shea the man he's replacing.) Half-time: Bayer Leverkusen 0 - 2 Manchester United. The Germans are all over the shop, like certain minute-by-minute match reporters. United deserve their lead, though, as they have been MILES better. (That's for a little boy called Miles Hughes who was six today. So happy birthday, Miles, even if your dad has lumbered you with a Leverkusen strip for a present.) His dad apologises for asking for a request and turning me into the \"Jimmy Young of minute-to-minute match reporters\", but I don't mind; I'm taking requests from now on in. 44 min: GOAL Bayer Leverkusen 0 - 2 Manchester United. Van Nistelrooy turns on a sixpence again, at the right-hand edge of the Leverkusen area, and gives the ball to Veron. Ruud continues running towards the penalty spot while Veron slips in Butt; Butt squares the ball to Van the Man, alone on the spot. Two-nil, and apologies for being so slow, but for Christ's sake why did they have to be so intricate about it? 43 min: Another cross from Babic on the left somehow evades three free Leverkusen players on the right. 40 min: A couple of sorties down the left for Babic culminates in a corner. And what slapstick bedlam ensues from it. Phil Neville has to clear a header off the line, Barthez comes to clear the following corner and drops it at the feet of Schneider; it's blocked, but only as far as Babic, who is only denied at the last by Ferdinand. At this point, the theme from Some Mothers Do Have 'Em started blaring from the BayArena tannoy. 38 min: This has gone all turgid again. Will somebody please do something? 35 min: While waiting for a Leverkusen free-kick to be taken, Ferdinand lightly clips Brdaric round the back of the neck. It's nothing more than a waft of air, but the \"attacked\" player falls to ground. For a moment, with referee and assistant chatting away, it looks like Rio is for the off. But it's only yellow. Lucio's free-kick swerves wildly but Barthez claims well. 31 min: GOAL Bayer Leverkusen 0 - 1 Manchester United. Veron takes the ball down near the D, pads the ball to Giggs on the left, who swings a diagonal ball towards Van Nistelrooy. The big Dutchman chests it down and slaps the ball through Juric's legs and into the net. Well, well. 30 min: This has got really dull, so let's allow Russell Brady to add insult to Neuville's injury. \"Neuville reminds me of a seedy cabaret host from decadent Weimer Germany.\" 25 min: Veron is caught this much offside from a through-ball by Butt. He'd have been clear with half of the field to cover and only the keeper to beat. Rolf Hughes wants clarification on the verb to Heskey. \"Does he who Heskeys the ball miles over the bar fall down before or after said shot?\" 21 min: Berbatov replaces the injured Neuville. 20 min: Seeing we've been talking about nudity, apologies for using the following phrase, but things are hairy down Silvestre's flank. Sadly for Leverkusen, Neuville wastes the acres of space he finds himself in and concedes a throw to United. 17 min: Another Beckham sidefoot after Van Nistelrooy turns two men delightfully in the box and lays it off. And another miss, with the ball sailing over the bar. United getting back into this after a shoddy start. Laura Parkes imagines me \"typing away on a laptop, connected to the internet, naked\". Some people would pay good money to receive emails like that, you know. 15 min: Giggs finds room down the left and cuts the ball back to the advancing Beckham. Instead of pelting the ball in the true Premiership manner, he tries one of those fancy continental finishes with the side of the foot and ends up looking oh-so-English. 13 min: For the second time, Basturk finds acres down the right but can only Emile it ten miles over the bar. Also more proof, if we need it, that Nicky Butt isn't the player Roy Keane is: he mouths off at the ref, but can't even get a booking. 10 min: Babic whips in a couple more crosses. Both are blocked. Leverkusen have obviously decided upon an Achilles heel. 9 min: Bit more possession for Leverkusen ends in a battle of the number 27s down the right, with Silvestre easing out Neuville. Gary Perry wants to know what I had for dinner tonight. Why does nobody ever ask me what I'm wearing? 6 min: Babic skelps in a cross from the right, Blanc nicks the ball from Neuville with his hip, and Basturk Heskeys the ball miles over the bar. Within 30 seconds, there's almost a carbon copy down the other end from a Beckham cross, but Giggs can't connect. With all this slapstick defending, this is now more like watching two relegation cases. Speaking of which, Newcastle are already one down, by the way. 3 min: It's pinging around pointlessly, with neither side able to get their foot on the ball. Although it's early doors, it's terrible stuff so far, like watching two sets of mid-table nonentities. Er... 1 min: And we're off. A bit of early pressure from Leverkusen ends with Basturk falling on the ball and rolling around on his front. Preamble: OK, both these clubs are in crisis, so we're told, although let's get some perspective: while United have done their level best to amuse the nation recently, they're neither just off the relegation zone, nor smarting from ballsing up big-style in Europe. So even Fergie's lads should be too much for Bayer. Dmitry Tuzoff wants to know whether I'm a United supporter. \"Pray, tell! God, please!!!\" No. Bayer Leverkusen: Juric, Lucio, Zivkovic, Basturk, Ballitsch, Ramelow, Ojigwe, Babic, Schneider, Neuville, Brdaric. Subs: Butt, Simak, Franca, Berbatov, Bierofka, Vranjes, Kleine. Man Utd: Barthez, O'Shea, Ferdinand, Blanc, Silvestre, Beckham, Veron, Phil Neville, Butt, Giggs, van Nistelrooy. Subs: Ricardo, Gary Neville, May, Stewart, Solskjaer, Forlan, Pugh. Referee: Jan Wegereef (Holland) Pre-team preamble: No teams yet, although Rolf Hughes is wondering if I'm experiencing any technical problems yet. No I'm not, Rolf, although I am watching Live With Chris Moyles and it is BLOODY AWFUL, so pain still exists in my life. Kick-off: 7.45pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
