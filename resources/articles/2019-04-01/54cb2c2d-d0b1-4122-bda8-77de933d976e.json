Olusoga, a professor of history at the University of Manchester, has a Nigerian father. He said the honour\u2019s links to Britain\u2019s violent imperial past made it difficult to accept, but he was able to rationalise accepting the honour while recognising the \u201cterrible, terrible episodes\u201d in its history. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we should have this ledger book, this balancing-scales view of the empire,\u201d Olusoga told the Radio Times. \u201cWas it good? Was it bad? Should we feel pride? Should we feel shame? \u201cI think we should look at the empire for what it was, this complicated, more-than-400-year story with terrible, terrible episodes. Using that word \u2018empire\u2019 does make it a difficult award to accept. But if you decline, then you should shut up about it and I had to ask myself the question \u2013 would I?\u201d The Order of the British Empire, like all other official honours of the British state, is problematic for many people of minority descent because of its links to the systematic domination, racist violence and genocide employed by the British in Africa, America, Asia and Australasia from the 17th century onwards. When the poet Benjamin Zephaniah refused the same honour in 2003 for his services to literature, he said he got angry just to hear the word \u201cempire\u201d. He wrote in the Guardian: \u201cIt reminds me of slavery, it reminds me of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised.\u201d \u201cBenjamin Zephaniah OBE \u2013 no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever is behind this offer can never have read any of my work.\u201d Olusoga, a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which publishes the Guardian, has written extensively on the the development of empire and the history of black people in Britain, including their involvement in the British military. He picked up his medal from the palace in January, when the Queen handed out her new year honours. He was cited for his services to history and community integration. In a Guardian article days later, he revealed that the \u201cexhilarating and humbling news\u201d of his award was tempered by the soul-searching over the \u201cextractive, exploitative, racist and violent\u201d nature of the empire. He accepted, he said, because he felt that it would be worse if no black or Asian Britons were honoured by the awards system, because \u201cthe contributions non-white people have made have long been under-recognised\u201d. Olusoga\u2019s recent comments on his OBE come days after Mohammed Mahmoud, imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, accepted the same award in recognition of his actions after the terror attack on worshippers there in 2017. Mahmoud, whose parents are Egyptian, also expressed reservations about the connotations of British colonialism, such as \u201cmassacres, subjugation and destruction of rich and proud cultures\u201d. But he said he had accepted the honour as \u201crecognition for everyone in my community\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
