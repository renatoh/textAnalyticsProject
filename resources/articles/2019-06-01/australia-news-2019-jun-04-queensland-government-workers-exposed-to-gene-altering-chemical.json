A leading occupational medical expert says that workers\u2019 exposure to the highly toxic fumigant ethylene dibromide (EDB) in the mid-1990s was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the cause of debilitating and serious illnesses suffered over two decades. One chronically ill former employee of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says the use of the chemical in defiance of long-known risks and forceful warnings from health authorities amounted to \u201cstate-sanctioned poisoning\u201d. A Guardian Australia investigation into the landmark papaya fruit fly eradication program has also revealed claims that long-term unemployed people were recruited to work with unconventional pesticides and told they were \u201cguinea pigs\u201d for their subsequent effects. The successful eradication effort, involving more than 300 workers, began in 1995 and cost more than $36m. Over three years it turned much of the farmland in north Queensland\u2019s fertile tropics into a chemical-soaked quarantine zone. More than a dozen allegations \u2013 by former DPI staff and others \u2013 including claims of indiscriminate chemical spraying, chemical misuse, inadequate protective equipment, poor workplace safety practices and a lack of sufficient health monitoring have been uncovered. Queensland government emails and memos show the DPI had been warned about serious health and public safety risks related to certain chemicals but continued to aggressively support their use. In interviews and court statements, workers have consistently said they were not given adequate information about the possible effects of chemicals before being exposed. Documents obtained under freedom of information laws show authorities knew about risks from EDB \u2013 which has no acceptable exposure limit \u2013 for decades before its use to fumigate fruit was hastily sanctioned. EDB was banned in the US in 1984. The US environmental protection agency once described the chemical as the \u201cmost powerful carcinogen\u201d it had ever tested. Australian authorities had been discussing a ban since the mid-1980s but continually delayed its implementation. When the papaya fruit fly was found in north Queensland in October 1995, an \u201coff-label\u201d permit for the unconventional use of EDB as a post-harvest fumigant was issued by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The NRA cancelled the permit after just two months, after evidence that communities were at risk of exposure from plumes from leaky fumigation tents, and that there were significant health risks for workers. But extensive evidence has been obtained that suggests the use of EDB continued after the permit was cancelled. Huge stockpiles of the chemical were bought in late 1995 \u2013 about 88,000L and 114,000kg. Several workers say they were handed unlabelled containers by DPI managers and told they should continue using the substance to fumigate fruit. Last year Queensland WorkCover found that one of those workers, Robert Paul Sharman, was exposed to EDB for a period of nine months, including for six months after the permit was withdrawn. WorkCover accepted evidence from Sharman, including medical records, blood tests, work records and letters about his fumigation licence, that he was \u201cexposed to EDB during the period October 1995 to June 1996\u201d while working for the DPI. But WorkCover rejected Sharman\u2019s claim for compensation, saying he had not proved his exposure caused conditions including cancer precursors, diseases affecting his lungs and teeth, skin conditions, migraines and various psychiatric illnesses. Sharman now has written statements from three medical and mental health professionals who say there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d his symptoms were caused by exposure to EDB. Sharman said he was unaware of the harmful effects of EDB, and a large body of research evidence linking it to cancer, organ failure, mental illness, neurological damage and several other conditions, until three years ago. Documents obtained under FoI show several government agencies raised vehement objections to the continued use of EDB in November 1995, the same month Sharman first presented to his doctor with symptoms of acute overexposure. Dr Gerard Neville, the state\u2019s acting director of public health at the time, wrote to the DPI saying the use of EDB \u201craises major concerns about the potential community and worker exposure\u201d. He said there was \u201cconsiderable concern\u201d about potential chronic health effects and called on the DPI to stop using the chemical. Sharman continued to work with EDB for another seven months. \u201cImagine finding this out 22 years later and that it was all hidden, that they knew all about it,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cNot only that, they were there and showed us how to use it. These are professional people in their fields. With prior knowledge, how could you do that? How could a common man do that to another man knowing about the chemical?\u201d Simulation tests conducted by Queensland Emergency Services on fumigation chambers, the results of which were also obtained through FoI, found in December 1995 that \u201ceven in the most favourable weather conditions\u201d homes up to 1.5km away were at risk of exposure to unacceptable doses of EDB. Sharman\u2019s repeated requests for government agencies to investigate his complaint about the continued unlicensed use of EDB have been rejected, mostly on the grounds the matter is historical and use of the chemical has long ceased. No protection Other government employees who worked at fumigation chambers support Sharman\u2019s recollection of the conditions. PVC fumigation tents \u2013 which were found by authorities not to meet requisite safety standards \u2013 were hastily set up on fruit farms and outside transport depots. They say chemicals, most commonly EDB, were poured on to an electric frypan, sitting on a milk crate, next to a desk fan. Workers claim they were given gloves to use but no other protective equipment. They wore shorts and T-shirts in the tropical heat and humidity. A memo from Queensland Workplace Health and Safety in November 1995 said fumigators should wear full-face respirators and other protective equipment. Elizabeth Bors, who worked with chemical blocks and sprays at Mareeba, made a court statement in 2006 \u2013 in a civil case about damage to coffee crops \u2013 that DPI managers refused to buy requested protective equipment, that workers were not properly monitored for exposure and that workers were given little information about the chemicals. Scientists also held strong concerns that the targeted eradication of the fruit fly was being run by north Queensland-based DPI managers without expertise in entomology or chemicals. The respected entomologist Dick Drew gave a statement to a court in mid-2007 that detailed how those managers had proposed \u201cdriving from Bingil Bay north, spraying everything in their path\u201d. \u2018Use as much as possible\u2019 The eradication program pivoted to the Torres Strait in 1998. Mark Trinca was a manager on a successor program, Northwatch, running ground operations. He was never given a baseline blood test and says he followed procedures as he was shown by veterans of the initial campaign. Trinca left the DPI in 2003, having worked consistently with multiple chemicals. He was diagnosed with Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma in 2011 and a liposarcoma in 2018. He believes both rare and aggressive cancers are a result of his chemical exposure. He says the papaya fruit fly program was successful but run by \u201ccowboys\u201d, whose approach to chemicals was to \u201cuse as much as possible\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a multibillion-dollar industry and I understand the philosophy behind hitting it hard and fast. Because, for the first time in history, we had something that was going to affect or potentially affect the biosecurity and the quality of Australian products being exported. \u201cThere was a need. It just so happens that the program in my opinion was run by cowboys who had no skill, quite a few of them were ex-military. This is what has to be done. Get in. Do it. Don\u2019t argue.\u201d The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the modern iteration of the DPI, said it had difficulty responding to specific claims given the amount of time that had passed, the fact many of the staff concerned had since retired, and that some records relating to the program had been destroyed in Cyclone Yasi in 2011. \u201cThe department works within and supports a national framework which determines chemical use based on expert assessment of safety risks to the user, the consumer and the environment,\u201d the department said. \u201cArrangements for chemical registration in the past and currently include opportunities for emergency registrations when situations arise which are outside routine use. This usage also requires assessment of the risk and expert decision-making. The department\u2019s policy has always focused on using chemicals for registered purposes. \u201cThe department is committed to ensuring risks associated with hazardous chemicals are eliminated or minimised as far as reasonably practicable, and that the health and safety of workers and other people are not put at risk from the department\u2019s use, handling or storage of hazardous chemicals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
