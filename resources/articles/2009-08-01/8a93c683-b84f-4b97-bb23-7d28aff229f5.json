Ian Collison, 46, was on his way to watch his son play against Spurs at Upton Park when he crashed on the M25 near Epping. Emergency services were called to the crash, which happened just before noon, but Mr Collison was pronounced dead at the scene. The 20-year-old Collison, who only later found out about his father's death due to difficulties in establishing next of kin, had played 89 minutes for a West Ham side who were still coming to terms with the news that their team-mate Calum Davenport had been the victim of a vicious knife attack at his family's Bedford home on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
