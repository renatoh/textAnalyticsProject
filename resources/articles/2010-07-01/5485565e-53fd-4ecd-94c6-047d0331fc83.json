Hills became the first of the big firms to publish a half-yearly trading update, announcing \"online net revenue growth of approximately 24% and operating profit approximately 43% higher than in the prior year\". \"Poor horse racing results\" led to a 33% fall in net telephone revenue, with the statement from Hills explicitly pointing out: \"The board has previously noted the challenge of competing with UK betting exchanges and Irish offshore telebetting operators, all of whom have benefited from significant tax and cost advantages over UK bookmakers. The situation is under active review.\" Emphasising the \"worst ever Royal Ascot\" and a \"relatively weak Grand National\" (despite their spokesman having described it as \"a black armband day for bookmakers\" at the time), the reporting of the strength of the online business and the weakness of horse racing, the statement is sure to antagonise further those from within racing who are seeking to increase Levy payments from bookmakers. Ruby Walsh will miss next week's Galway Festival after being advised to give his broken arm longer to heal. The Irish champion jockey suffered the triple fracture when parting company with Celestial Halo in the Aintree Hurdle in April and his specialist Bill Quinlan feels he is not ready for a return to the saddle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
