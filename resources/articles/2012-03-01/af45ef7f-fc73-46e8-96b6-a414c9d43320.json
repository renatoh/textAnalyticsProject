But another member of the coterie has put his head above the parapet. And once again, we find that things are not as they are supposed to be. Luke Coffey was Fox's special adviser. An American citizen, a former soldier and a member of the Council for Emerging National Security Affairs \u2013 an intelligence-linked US thinktank \u2013 Coffey was there when Liam Fox was having odd meetings with Werritty and businessmen in Dubai. Think of him as the third limb. Well, since Fox lost his job, Coffey has moved on, and last month he became a \"Margaret Thatcher Fellow\" at Washington thinktank the Heritage Foundation. However, the advisory committee for business appointments, which polices the revolving door between government and the private sector, is not happy. This month it said: \"Under the rules introduced in February 2011, all applications from special advisers must be referred to the advisory committee who then makes its recommendation to the appropriate permanent secretary\". The MoD messed up; a breach of protocol. \"The committee was concerned that this had not happened in this case.\" For all that, it approved Coffey's new job, so long as he desists for 12 months from lobbying government. Everyone deserves a fresh start but especially him. Dr Fox, Werritty \u2026 he was with a bad crowd. \u2022 More on AssetCo, the private company that benefited from multimillion-pound deals to supply the capital's fire brigade with appliances and strike breaking crews etc. It's all becoming a bit of a nightmare. The firm is heavily in debt and, as reported in yesterday's Diary, its money worries are affecting performance. Officials in London, charged with saving life and limb, are obviously worried. Yes, money's tight. How tight? Well we know that in the midst of the woes, one creditor \u2013 an airjet-leasing company \u2013 became so worried about monies outstanding that it legally pursued the possibility of seizing one of the capital's fire engines and selling it for the proceeds. It didn't happen, but only because the banks objected. And why did they do that? Because AssetCo owed them money too. \u2022 Meanwhile, further to yesterday's items about AssetCo and the London fire authority chair Brian Coleman, we are contacted by the London Fire Brigade with a point of clarification. It is not the case that, subsequent to being wined and dined by AssetCo, Coleman led the authority into a multimillion-pound deal to supply fire engines and other appliances. That deal was struck under the previous Labour administration. In fact, the five-year deal struck with AssetCo by the Coleman-led authority, after he was wined and dined by AssetCo, was for \u00a39m and related to the provision by the firm of strike-breaking firefighters. That's better, isn't it? \u2022 Another example, finally, of MPs grappling with issues that really trouble the nation. Why, asks the early day motion from Lib Dem John Hemming, are the BBC and other outlets referring to George Osborne coming down on tax avoiders \"like a tonne of bricks\"? This is \"part of a trend of metrication of traditional British phrases\", he says, and \"given that a ton is greater in weight than a tonne, this understates the chancellor's commitment to action\". One signatory so far: John Hemming. The pulse of the nation. Twitter: @hugh_muir \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2012.
