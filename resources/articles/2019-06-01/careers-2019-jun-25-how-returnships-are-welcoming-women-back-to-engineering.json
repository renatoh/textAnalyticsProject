Part of this is down to the success and popularity of returnships or mid-career schemes. \u201cReturnships are a fantastic way for women to come back to a career they have previously had success in and possibly even a chance for them to make a switch to a different career with the skills they have already amassed,\u201d Donnelly says. \u201cThese programmes build confidence, reinvigorate the desire for learning and development and upskill the individuals taking part.\u201d In 2017, the government pledged that it would provide \u00a35m to fund returnships, but diversity and inclusion initiatives are also making a difference. Many large employers \u2013 including Amey, Arup, O2 and Vodafone \u2013 are now offering returnship schemes as part of their diversity strategies. Natalie Desty, founder of Stem Returners, says such schemes have a positive impact on company culture. \u201cIt allows line managers to see for themselves that returning employees are just as capable after a break, and also opens minds to flexible and home-working options, which benefits everybody,\u201d she says. Almost all (98%) of the people placed by Stem Returners have gone on to accept a permanent position with the company. They operate in the mid-career sector because this is, Desty says, where there is the biggest recruitment dip. \u201cThese programmes welcome back experienced and capable individuals into the mid-career space with lots of valuable and transferrable skills they have learned while on their break.\u201d They often have the edge over younger employees because of their experience. Ellie Zemani, an engineer and returner at Spirit Energy, says the best thing a company can do to show its commitment to women returners is provide strong role models. \u201cI have two boys and took a year off for each. I came back full-time but worked reduced hours for the first couple of months,\u201d she says. Zemani was inspired by other women in her organisation. \u201cWe have had a couple of great examples, where women were promoted to senior leadership roles after returning from maternity leave or career breaks. For me, this sends the message that women \u2013 as well as men\u2013 can take a parental leave and stay on track.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
