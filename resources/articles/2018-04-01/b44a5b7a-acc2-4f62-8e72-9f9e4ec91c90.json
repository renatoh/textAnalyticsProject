Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel was sworn in as president on Thursday, becoming the island\u2019s first leader without the Castro surname for the first time in almost 60 years. At a functionalist conference centre in Havana, D\u00edaz-Canel, 57, read a brief speech which sought to reconcile revolutionary continuity with a recognition of the need for change. He said there would be no \u201ccapitalist restoration\u201d, but promised to make better use of the internet and push on with \u201cthe modernization of our social and economic model\u201d. He finished his address with the familiar rhetorical flourish: \u201cSocialism or Death! We will triumph!\u201d Ra\u00fal Castro, 86 \u2013 who stood down as president after 12 years in the office but remains first secretary of the Communist party \u2013 embraced D\u00edaz-Canel, and gave his presidency a ringing endorsement. But he left no doubt where power still lies. In an uncharacteristically long speech, in which he repeatedly joked and went off script, Castro emphasised the need to fight corruption \u2013 and said he would stay on to guide his successor. Castro said he expected D\u00edaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president before replacing him as first secretary of the party when he retires in 2021. \u201cFrom that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,\u201d Castro said. Amid the anachronistic language, there were signs that the new president was trying to forge a more modern image for the island\u2019s ruling Communist party. In what appeared to be a centrally managed information operation, the hashtag #somoscontinuidad (#wearecontinuity) was trending on Twitter. Internet access has expanded rapidly in recent years, but still remains below the regional average. All major international news websites can be accessed from the island, but government censors block critical blogs as well as webpages financed by the US state department. Communist party insiders say D\u00edaz-Canel is aware of the economic benefits that wider internet access could bring the island\u2019s economy, but fears the island\u2019s political system could be overwhelmed. Under the Obama administration, USAid worked on developing a \u201cCuban twitter\u201d aimed at fomenting unrest, and in January the US state department launched a Cuba Internet Task Force, which Havana sees as another attempt to undermine it. D\u00edaz-Canel assumes office at a tricky time for the island after the Trump administration partially reversed the fragile d\u00e9tente announced by Castro and Barack Obama in 2014. The US has said Cuba was \u201cresponsible\u201d for a series of mysterious health ailments affecting US embassy personnel on the island and has withdrawn more than half of its diplomatic staff. Washington has also warned US citizens not to visit the island \u2013 a move which is starting to choke off tourism revenues. Cuba\u2019s main ally, Venezuela, is in crisis, and has heavily cut back on highly subsidized oil shipments to Cuba, upon which the island is heavily reliant. One of D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s first tasks as president will be to unify the island\u2019s byzantine dual-currency system. Analysts say that if not managed correctly, unification could provoke inflation which could hit the purchasing power of poorer Cubans who form the base of the government\u2019s support. Unlike the carefully orchestrated election, currency unification has the potential to unsettle the island\u2019s seemingly rock-solid political stability. Cubans were divided about the new president. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news for me,\u201d said Liliam Rodr\u00edguez, 33, who works as a tour guide. \u201cHe\u2019s looks like he\u2019s against the private sector in recent speeches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a president,\u201d Gerardo Cartalla, 56, a taxi driver. \u201cIn the current situation, I\u2019d have liked Ra\u00fal to stay on as president. He\u2019s somebody everybody respects.\u201d This article was amended on 19 April 2018 to correct a mistyping of Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
