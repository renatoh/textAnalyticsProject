McManus met with Setka, who is the boss of the union\u2019s Victorian branch, on Thursday, telling him to resign or else the Morrison government would use the controversy around him \u201cfor their own ends\u201d. Setka insists only his construction union members will determine his future and is standing firm against claims he criticised anti-domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty. He claims he is the victim of false allegations being made for political gain. The union peak body cannot remove Setka from the role. He could only be removed if he chose to stand down, or he was successfully charged under union laws with bringing the CFMMEU into disrepute. McManus flew back early from a labour conference in Switzerland for Thursday\u2019s crisis talks with Setka. She emerged from the meeting to declare it was time for Setka to quit, asking him to consider that \u201cno one is bigger than the movement\u201d. \u201cWhile John is elected by his members, he also needs to consider the interests of working people and the wider union movement,\u201d McManus said. She also conceded \u201cthe union movements\u2019s reputation has been damaged\u201d. The controversial union boss has faced calls to quit over claims he denigrated Rosie Batty in a union meeting, which he and one witness have since denied. He will also front court later this month over a harassment case and has said he will plead guilty. Asked whether it was the alleged Batty comments or the court case that had prompted McManus to call for his resignation, she said it was \u201cunrelated to Rosie Batty\u201d and based \u201ca whole range of issues\u201d. She said she could not comment on the court case. Earlier, it emerged the Coalition is preparing to use the Setka from the Labor party to pressure the Senate to pass laws further punishing unions for breaching laws that restrict industrial action. The move comes as a new paper from the Centre for Future Work argues unions should not abandon political campaigns because rebuilding membership will not be possible without laws granting stronger labour rights. On Wednesday senior frontbencher Angus Taylor confirmed the government was still \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to passing the ensuring integrity bill which would allow the federal court to disqualify union officials and deregister unions for serious or repeated law breaches. McManus seized on Taylor\u2019s comments to tell Setka it was \u201cclear [the Coalition] will trying and exploit the situation for their own ends\u201d. Also on Thursday the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, hit back at Setka, the Victorian construction secretary of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, who has stared down calls to resign over claims he had criticised anti-domestic violence advocate Rosie Batty. Albanese said Setka\u2019s views were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the Labor party and mainstream Australia, and highlighted inconsistencies with the version of events provided by Maritime Union of Australia official Chris Cain, who claims Setka had not even mentioned Batty in a union meeting last week. Setka said on Wednesday that suggestions he \u201cdenigrated\u201d Batty were \u201cfabricated\u201d. \u201cI have always been a huge supporter of Rosie Batty and admired the tireless work she has done and what she has achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just disgraceful for people to imply that \u2026 I am actually offended and it\u2019s vile.\u201d Despite his criticism of Setka, Albanese told Radio National that Australians were \u201csick of the government attacking trade unions\u201d, signalling that Labor will continue to oppose the ensuring integrity bill. The bill is supported by One Nation and Cory Bernardi, meaning that Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie are likely to have the casting votes when it is reintroduced to parliament. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The director of the Centre for Future Work, an offshoot of the leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, has warned that unions must not abandon political campaigns \u2013 in part because the Coalition \u201cmay now try to shift labour policies even further in favour of employers\u201d. In a briefing note, released on Thursday, director Jim Stanford argued that better labour market rules and union organising efforts were \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d, implicitly refuting claims unions should abandon political campaigns after the $25m Change the Rules campaign failed to eject the Morrison government. Critics of the campaign, including former ACTU assistant secretary Tim Lyons and National Union of Workers national secretary Tim Kennedy, have warned the movement should not become the \u201ccampaigning arm\u201d of Labor but rather focus on organising workplaces. The ACTU has launched a review of the campaign, with McManus promising to recalibrate if necessary but not to abandon the field of political campaigning. Stanford defended the unions\u2019 campaign, arguing it lifted support for increasing the minimum wage and limiting the spread of insecure work, and even contributed to the Coalition pledging to combat systemic underpayment. Stanford\u2019s paper cited the fact that strong majorities \u2013 of more than 70% in some cases \u2013 support restoring penalty rates and lifting the minimum wage, suggesting that public pressure has contributed to the Fair Work Commission lifting the minimum wage by a total of 10% over the last three years. It noted that Australia ranks 22nd \u2013 fifth last in the OECD \u2013 on labour rights, according to the World Economic Forum, and 20th on union membership, with just 14.5% of workers in trade unions. While some countries, such as France, have strong labour rights despite low union density, there are none with union density of more than 20% without strong protections for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cThe international evidence is clear that eventually winning changes in the rules of the labour market \u2026 will be essential, as a complement (not a substitute) for unions\u2019 continuing efforts to expand membership, extend collective bargaining, and lift wages,\u201d it concluded. Stanford said that Australia\u2019s legal framework is \u201cvery hostile to unions and collective bargaining\u201d, citing the shift to enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s and Howard-era restrictions on industrial activity. \u201cPeople who say the rules are what they are \u2013 in the short term they\u2019re correct but in the long term unions in Australia still have to keep trying to achieve a more balanced legal climate or they will never break out of this box.\u201d Stanford told Guardian Australia the viability of the collective bargaining system is \u201cin doubt\u201d because 35% of employees are covered by enterprise agreements but only 14% pay union dues. \u201cYou have a situation where free riding is guaranteed by law and protected by law \u2013 it\u2019s almost celebrated by law. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unviable to offer a service you\u2019re required to give to anyone and they\u2019re not required to pay for it.\u201d Although the Change the Rules campaign did not argue for the introduction of compulsory bargaining fees or a return of the closed shop, Stanford said it had argued for \u201cincremental improvements\u201d, such as allowing multi-employer bargaining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
