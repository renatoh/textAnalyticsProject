Dale Campe\u00f3n!\u201d (\u201cCome on champion, come on champion!\u201d) Despite heavy rainfall, groups of fans headed for the Buenos Aires obelisk on the wide downtown 9 de Julio Avenue, the traditional scene of football celebrations, to celebrate River beating Boca Juniors 3-1 in the much-delayed second leg of the Copa Libertadores final in Madrid. Argentina\u2019s capital remained a virtual ghost town on Sunday afternoon as tense football fans remained glued to their TV sets indoors. The stillness was broken only by the loud screaming that emerged from open windows with each goal. Even the Al Dente gastronomic fair, a big city event that draws thousands of visitors each year to the neighbourhood of Colegiales, remained eerily empty, except for a crowd of football fans gathered around two giant TV screens set up specially to watch the game. Argentinians are still in shock that the \u201cscandalous violence\u201d of their football fans, as a TV announcer on the TN network put it on Sunday, forced the game to played outside Argentina. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better the game was played in Madrid,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Francolini, who took time off from his restaurant\u2019s stand at the fair to watch the game. \u201cAt least this way we were able to watch the game without fighting.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to celebrate, we should be turning our back to the game because of what happened in Buenos Aires,\u201d River fan Juan Pablo Garrido agreed but nonetheless was watching the game on the giant screens at Al Dente. Garrido jumped with joy when River finally won. But how did it feel when Boca took the lead in the first half? \u201cIt felt like shit,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
