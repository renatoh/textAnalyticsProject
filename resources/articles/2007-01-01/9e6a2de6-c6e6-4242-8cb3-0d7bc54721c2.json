But since moving here [to Worcestershire] two-and-a-half years ago, I've changed. The house has seven hectares and a small lake and all the trees had become incredibly overgrown. That's how I got my passion for my chain saw. I now spend my weekends cutting down and clearing. It's more country peasant than country squire. I like doing the dirty work. That's where the satisfaction lies. It's my complete escape after the week in London. For work I have to go to a lot of events - two or three each evening. My country persona is a counterpoint to that. I sometimes think that if the people I hang out with Monday to Friday caught sight of me in my ripped old trousers and leather hat they wouldn't recognise me. I'm very much teased by my children. They think I think it's macho. Actually, it probably comes from a desire for neatness. I like beautifying the place in a kind of ecology-meets-Action Man sort of way. And I enjoy the physical exercise. Dragging large branches around the place and cutting up logs with a chain saw is better than going to the gym. I find it incredibly satisfying. We sometimes have as many as three bonfires going - quite apocalyptic. Ironically, one of the characters in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - the PlayStation game Alexander made me play - has a chain saw. It's one of the weapons you can get (though it bears no resemblance to my nice orange chain saw!). I apparently did well to get an AK-47. I have spent the last seven years avoiding this hideous game, but actually I rather enjoyed it. Everyone stood around watching me play, half hoping the game would win my approval after all this time and half hoping I wouldn't understand it and would show myself up. I am completely against the PlayStation. I hate all these trailing wires all over the TV room, and when I sit down to watch television it's always connected to the PS and I don't know how to disconnect it. Also, I don't normally object to gratuitous violence but the games we have around the house seem to be particularly gruesome. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a gangsta turf-war game. My character was an African American with a great big tattoo on his back. He's just got out of jail and he's racing around trying to clear an area of other gangstas. It's fantastically violent. It should be sold with an 18 certificate. Oh, Alexander now says that it is. I hadn't realised. I thought we just bought it in Woolworths ... apparently we did! As cars come towards you, your character rushes out and pulls people out of the car and throws them upon the road and drives over them. I've seen Alexander and his brothers doing this and instantly recoiled. But it is different when you are holding the controller. It is a very compelling game and more sophisticated than I'd realised. You feel you are achieving something. Of course you aren't, but momentarily you feel that you are. I think it makes you quite frenetic. And it's indoors. I'd rather be outside with my chain saw. It clears my head. I can't pretend I'm going to play the PlayStation for hours after work, but it did make me realise why people can waste so much time on it and get so addicted. Alexander Coleridge: Dad prefers switching the PlayStation off to playing it. I enjoy it but he exaggerates how much I play. He's never played it before. I expected him not to know what to do at all and it did take him about half an hour or so just to work out how to move around. In the end he got a bit better but I wouldn't say he was an expert. It was quite funny to watch. He kept crashing the car, and saying, \"This game is very rough.\" I think Grand Theft Auto is fun and it requires skill. It's fun completing missions and it's quite satisfying, especially if you've been trying to do something for a while and then you do. I don't think what Dad does outside is really any more useful. He's out there every Saturday and Sunday morning and he always makes us come out and look at what he's been doing all morning. It always looks exactly the same. Even when he has cleared a bit it looks neither better nor worse than before. It's pointless. I had to go to the plantation and cut with the chain saw for about two hours. I was freezing cold and it wasn't enjoyable at all. It was monotonous and really wasn't satisfying. I had to wear a mask in case chips flew up in my eyes and ear guards because it's very noisy. That made it even more uncomfortable. Dad thinks he looks macho chopping down trees. I think he looks stupid; he even wears a cowboy hat! He looks better in his weekday clothes. We live in London during the week and the country at weekends. Dad is more relaxed in the country, but I like him in both places. He's funny; he likes tidying everything up - even the undergrowth! We do a lot together: bicycling, swimming (in the river in summer and now a swimming pool is being built here), kayaking and walking in the Malvern Hills. Dad likes walking. I do too. I bring an iPod. \u00b7 The paperback of Nicholas Coleridge's latest novel, A Much Married Man, is published by Orion next month"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
