James Davis was the second highest ranking executive at Stanford International Bank, which went into receivership last month after Stanford, a billionaire cricket impresario, was charged with fraud by the US securities and exchange commission. A Dallas-based lawyer for Davis, David Finn, said his client had reversed a decision two weeks ago to assert his fifth amendment right to silence. \"We are fully co-operating with federal investigators,\" Finn said. \"It's a massive investigation that will take some time to resolve. We are ready, willing and able to answer questions truthfully and provide whatever assistance we can.\" Davis's co-operation is a significant step for the SEC and for the US department of justice, which has been building a criminal case over Stanford's collapse. Finn said his client was not offered leniency: \"Nothing has been promised and nothing has been asked for.\" The SEC has accused Stanford and his senior colleagues of using false pretences to lure thousands of Americans into investing in so-called certificates of deposit. The money was supposed to be invested in stocks and bonds but instead, according to the SEC, it was directed off-shore. Stanford, who was knighted in Antigua, domiciled his holding company on the Caribbean island, although its investment arm was largely run from Texas. The firm's Dallas office was raided by federal officials in February and he was subsequently served with regulatory papers at the home of his girlfriend's family in Virginia. Stanford is a big name in the sporting world as the tycoon behind the Twenty20 international cricket tournament. A receiver appointed by the Antiguan government today updated investors, saying there was \"a significant shortfall of assets\" at Stanford International Bank and Stanford Trust Company. \"We continue in our work to identify SIB assets,\" said Nigel Hamilton-Smith, a partner at the accountancy firm Vantis. \"This is increasingly a forensic exercise to trace funds that have flowed through other Stanford entities and, due to the scale of this project, is likely to take many months to complete.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
