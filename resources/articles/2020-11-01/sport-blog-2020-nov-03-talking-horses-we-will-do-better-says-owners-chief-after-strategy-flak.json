The 27-page document, focused on keeping owners in the sport, is the fruit of work that began more than two years ago and has been funded by the Levy Board to the tune of \u00a31.2m. The former trainer Charlie Brooks, writing in the Daily Telegraph, and the owner Jon Hughes have both expressed doubts recently as to whether that was money well spent and have questioned why it has taken so long to get to a final document. Defending the ROA\u2019s position, its chief executive, Charlie Liverton, said on Monday: \u201cWe recognise this document hasn\u2019t been shared externally but it\u2019s been shared very widely internally. It\u2019s been signed off by the Levy Board, by the BHA board and the Members\u2019 Committee. \u201cAll of the initiatives have been cross-industry stakeholder-led. All of the costs have been challenged throughout [by the Levy Board]. We\u2019ve learned that updating the industry internally clearly isn\u2019t good enough and that we need to be much more explicit in updating owners and the media more proactively. We haven\u2019t hidden anything at all, we\u2019ve been quite open within the industry as to what we\u2019re doing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got industry-set key performance indicators that everybody\u2019s approved and agreed. What we haven\u2019t done is tell that story externally, and we hear that. We\u2019ve been open and transparent in our annual reports but I hear that we could have done better and we need to do better and we will do better.\u201d Liverton hopes the strategy document will help the sport weather the crisis posed by Covid-19 but Hughes, who has seen it, retains his doubts. \u201cNicely produced, attractive branding but, I\u2019m afraid, pretty vacuous,\u201d was his instant verdict. \u201cWhere are the numbers in terms of targets and return on investment? There should be a five-year plan with clear indications of acquisition and retention. At the moment, owners are racing for the exit.\u201d Regarding the \u00a31.2m funding for development of the strategy, Hughes said: \u201cLet\u2019s say the consultants were charging \u00a31,000 a day, that\u2019s 1,200 days or about five man years. If you put in five years\u2019 worth of work, you better have a cracking strategy coming out the other side.\u201d Liverton was asked whether ROA members would see the sum spent as good value, and replied: \u201cFrom the members we\u2019ve spoken to over the last two years, their feedback has been positive about what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re going about it and they\u2019ve noticed an improvement in the way they are looked after in the industry overall. \u201cThat\u2019s on a cumulative basis. I think if you put a number out there and shone a light on it and said, is this value, you\u2019re going to open up a different mindset, potentially. But I think we have worked on a lot of initiatives with success.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s best bets My early-hours attempt at picking the Melbourne Cup winner did not work out well. Happily, it\u2019s also Haldon Gold Cup day and Greaneteen (2.25) is a plausible favourite at 7-4. Paul Nicholls must have had a few candidates for a race he has won six times but he has gone with this youngster, a progressive novice last season and fourth in the Grand Annual when last seen. In the opening novice hurdle, Nickelsonthedime (12.55) can build on a useful debut at Warwick last month, with this more galloping circuit to help. He is 5-1 against the penalised Ask A Honey Bee, from a yard that appears to be going off the boil. It\u2019s interesting to see Torquay (3.55) revert to hurdles after her fencing got a bit scruffy at Rasen. She had looked nicely handicapped on her previous start and is capable of better here at 40-1, with cheekpieces to help. Pick of the Redcar card may be My Boy Lewis (1.10) at 6-1. He seems to need a testing surface, which may be related to his habit of blowing the start. Thirsk didn\u2019t work out for him last time but these circumstances are more promising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
