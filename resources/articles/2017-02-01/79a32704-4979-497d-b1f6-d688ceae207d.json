Gathering in Boston\u2019s Copley Square, outside the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), several scientists gave speeches to a crowd holding signs shaped like beakers and reading \u201cStand up for science\u201d. The speeches reflected a sea change in the culture of many labs and universities, where many researchers long maintained that good scientific work could speak for itself. At the AAAS conference, scientists this week have discussed political activism, the psychology of \u201cfake news\u201d , and how to protect climate science from hostile governments. But a rift has opened up in the community between those in favor and those opposed to rallies focused on science, including a March for Science planned across multiple cities in April. Professor Jim Gates, the eminent string theorist and former adviser to Barack Obama, told journalists that the march appeared to lack an end goal \u2013 a prerequisite for political action \u2013 and would simply be perceived as \u201cscience against Trump\u201d. \u201cAt least as far as I can detect, there is no theory of action behind this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bothers me tremendously. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how the organisers of this march can guard against provocateurs, quite frankly,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready for that, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re considering that kind of danger. To have science represented as this political force I think is just extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d Others urged the protesters on, including Rush Holt, the CEO of AAAS, said that his organization would work with other US societies to \u201cmake the march a success\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my 50-year career that I have seen people speaking up for science at large,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen for or against nuclear power or whatever. This is an unusual phenomenon.\u201d Astrid Caldas, a climate scientist and member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the rally showed that \u201cscientists who are usually happy in the corner of their labs are speaking\u201d. \u201cI think that scientists are realizing that they have to use their voice, as scientists, in self-defense.\u201d Dr Jacquelyn Gill, an ecologist at the University of Maine, was one of the speakers Sunday, and is tentatively considering whether to run for Congress in 2018. \u201cA lot of scientists are realizing that the institutions that fund and support and science in this country \u2013 science for everyone, publicly funded and transparent \u2013 those institutions are under direct attack,\u201d she told the Guardian. Trump, she said, \u201cnot only doesn\u2019t value our institutions, he doesn\u2019t seem to value evidence-based decision making at all. That is alarming to us.\u201d The president\u2019s views about science \u2013 he has variously called global warming a \u201choax\u201d and pledged to \u201cunlock the mysteries of space\u201d \u2013 is not the only concern on the scientists\u2019 minds. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re going to lose the EPA. I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re going to lose regulations that have a direct impact on human health, like automobile emissions,\u201d Gill said. \u201cPeople will get sicker. People will die because of a lack of environmental regulation and medical research.\u201d Beka Economopoulos, one of the rally\u2019s organizers and a co-founder of the Natural History Museum, a mobile exhibition, said that scientists could no longer truly avoid politics. \u201cThat ship has sailed,\u201d she said, noting that researchers have a long history protesting, for instance against nuclear proliferation in the 1970s. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about scientists, it\u2019s about science,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunities are going to bear the brunt of the impacts of these attacks on science in the public interest.\u201d Gill also stressed that the nascent movement wanted to stress \u201cscience for the people, by the people and for the people\u201d. Arguments about \u201ctrimming the fat\u201d of budgets, she said, did not stand up to scrutiny, considering that the government\u2019s science and medical research funding makes up a tiny percentage of the federal budget. \u201cThat money has got one of the best returns on investment you could possibly hope for,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real stakeholders are the citizens that stand to gain or lose the most if the institutions are weakened.\u201d Another organizer, Emily Southard, said that the rally and the march in Washington, were meant to help \u201cdemystify what scientists do\u201d. She defended \u201cscience that delivers clean, safe drinking water to our faucets, science that\u2019s being taken for granted \u2013 and that\u2019s the science that\u2019s being taken under attack.\u201d Economopoulos used the Environmental Protection Agency as an example, criticizing its newly confirmed head, who repeatedly sued the agency in favor of corporations as Oklahoma attorney general . \u201cWe have a sort of fox in the henhouse situation here with Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA, an agency that he has sued 14 times,\u201d she said. Gill also said that researchers needed to do more to take control of their image, noting the ways scientists had been politicized by lawmakers in debates over climate science. \u201cThrowing more information or more data doesn\u2019t really change minds, whether it\u2019s climate change or vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cEmpathy trumps fact when it comes to people\u2019s minds.\u201d Such disputes were nothing new, she said: \u201cScience and religion clashes go back to Darwin and Galileo and Copernicus.\u201d Caldas said that she hoped scientists would continue organize at local levels. \u201cThe federal government may not be on board, but local government works hardest with people who see these problems at their doorsteps, and they cannot deny it.\u201d Members of Congress facing re-election, she said, were already starting to feel pressure from constituents about climate change. \u201cThe stakes are really high but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
