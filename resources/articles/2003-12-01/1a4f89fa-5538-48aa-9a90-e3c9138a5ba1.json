Doug McAvoy also warned the government not to become complacent over standard assessment tests (Sats) for primary school pupils. \"I have not led this union on the basis of wanting militancy and industrial action on issue after issue after issue,\" he said this afternoon. The vote taken by NUT members over whether or not to sanction Sats did not secure a boycott because of low voter turnout. Little more than a third of eligible members - 35,327 - participated, of which 86% supported industrial action. Yet according to union rules, more than 50% must take part. An NUT official described this as a \"very high hurdle\". General trade union legislation only requires a simple majority of those voting for industrial action to be passed. The NUT chose to adhere to its stringent regulations to avoid salary cuts for its members. The use of this rule means that had action been supported, the union could have compensated teachers for any lost salary. It did so during a similar boycott in 1993 after the tests were first introduced by the Conservative government. If teachers lost out on pay because of a boycott, the union would have had to reimburse the teachers. \"If we had gone ahead, the members would have still been protected, but there would have been a lower threshold for compensation,\" said the NUT's head of education, John Bangs. \"There was no option. We were always going to abide by our rules.\" Earlier today a defiant Mr McAvoy said: \"Government should be under no illusion that the strength of feeling against tests remains undiminished. The teaching profession remains convinced that the tests constrain their professional judgment and undermine children's learning. The NUT will continue to press its concerns about the damaging effects of the tests.\" Other teaching organisations expressed mixed views over the ballot results, but remained united in their belief that the system of compulsory testing should change. Mary Bousted, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"ATL believes that a reform of the current regime is more likely to come through informed discussion than through ballots and industrial action. The current regime of targets, tests and tables is in urgent need of reform.\" The chief executive of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, David Butler, said: \"The findings from our survey of PTAs send out a very clear message to government from parents. Primary pupils are over-tested and the government needs to address this issue immediately.\" The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said while the ballot result was a matter for the NUT, it would continue pursuing its own policy on Sats. In March the NASUWT warned that unless excessive teacher workload created as a result of the national tests did not decrease, schools could face industrial action. So far the union has refused to ballot a boycott on the grounds that such action may be illegal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
