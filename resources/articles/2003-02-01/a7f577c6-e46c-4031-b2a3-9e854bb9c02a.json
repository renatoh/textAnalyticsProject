Thousands of young men, many naked, swarmed in a vast, walled compound. Occasionally the tension became too much and they stampeded, raising clouds of red dust. Then uniformed soldiers swung in, driving them back with heavy rope belts used as whips. Every now and then a young volunteer would stumble off, wounded and dazed. In their midst a tall paramilitary gendarme, dressed in red T-shirt and blue beret, had a look of distress on his face. What authority was left seemed to reside with him. This was recruitment day - a call for volunteers to join the fight against the rebels who since September have split Ivory Coast in two. But for this gendarme, it was a sign his country was plunging over the brink. The officer removed his thick leather belt and cracked it, forcing back a hundred or so men away from a row of tables where naked volunteers lined up for a crude fitness test. The men were among 20,000 or so responding to a government call in Ivory Coast's main city for recruits to put down the rebellion in the north and west. Many were disaffected, jobless and allied to a 'patriotic' youth movement led by firebrand loyalist Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9. His movement is based primarily on political and ethnic affiliation to President Laurent Gbagbo, a southern Christian swept to power in a popular revolt after contentious elections in 2000. The recruitment drive threatened an escalation of the conflict that has displaced nearly a million people and killed 5,000. As rebel numbers in the north and west swell along regional lines, there are potentially catastrophic consequences for one of the world's poorest regions. Since the death in 1993 of its autocratic independence leader, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, a combination of Machiavellian plots by its politicians and economic crisis after world cocoa and coffee prices collapsed has led Ivory Coast to the brink. Sensitive to the country's ethnic and religious mix, Houphou\u00ebt kept a careful balance, or dispensed largesse to aggrieved groups. Successive heads of state - all from rival factions of the Christian-dominated south - have been less careful. During the Nineties their main Muslim rival, Alassane Ouattara, was gaining in popularity. A series of voting and identity laws directed against his supporters and based on a concept known as 'Ivoirite' were introduced. This defined Ivorian nationals according to their ethnicity, casting millions of second and third generation West African immigrants into stateless limbo. By association, Muslims from the north, who share ethnicity with immigrants from neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, were made foreigners in their own land. Ouattara has been barred from standing for election because he once used a passport from Burkina Faso and could not prove his Ivorian ancestry. 'Ivoirite' set the stage for civil war, unleashing a wave of xenophobia in the Christian south at a time when tensions over jobs and land were rising. At the same time it focused the sense of grievance and disenfranchisment felt by Muslims, northerners and immigrants. This came to a head last September when soldiers from the mainly Muslim north attempted a coup. They failed but took the north, and precipitated another allied rebellion in the west. The African Development Bank, Ivory Coast's largest foreign employer, yesterday announced the first evacuations of staff from the country. The bank has long been seen as a bellwether of foreign firms in Ivory Coast. Its departure shows that big business doubts the once-stable country can pull out of a four-month-old civil war. Two weeks ago in Paris, Gbagbo, the rebels and political parties signed a power-sharing agreement, including a commitment by the government to unravel exclusionist policies. But rebel claims they were given the Interior and Defence Ministries, effectively putting them in charge of the army and gendarmes, provoked outrage. On cue Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9's patriotic youth went on the rampage in Abidjan, looting French business and attacking foreigners while security forces stood by. The Burkina Faso embassy was burnt, the French embassy mobbed. French families trying to evacuate from the airport were jeered and told never to return in an attack that took on the flavour of a second bid for independence. Gbagbo was ominously silent about the power-sharing agreement for two weeks, until a televised address late on Friday. 'We are tired of war. Let us try this new remedy,' he said. Gbagbo is under huge international pressure to accept the deal. But his speech contained many caveats, and he is a past master of saying one thing and doing another. He has to take the army with him - and that may be difficult enough. He also has to convince the rebels. But his most immediate problem is the streets - populated by Christian youth brought up on 'Ivoirite'. They put Gbagbo in power, they may yet bring him down. It depends to some extent on the leadership provided on the streets by Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, whose attitude is unambiguous. 'I don't believe there can be a peaceful solution because I am sure the rebels don't want a peaceful solution. When they came on 19 September they came to kill and to take power.' They failed then, he said, but he believes they're prepared to renew civil war. His enemies respond that, like many before him, Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9 is riding a tiger he cannot control. \u00b7 Enemies Within, reported by William Wallis and directed by Callum Macrae, is on C4 at 7.20pm on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
