The findings, from the British Fashion Council (BFC) also predict that half of the entire industry could cease to exist by the end of 2020. \u201cWithout some sort of government intervention you could see a whole generation of creative business wiped out,\u201d says chief executive Caroline Rush. As well as designers, the figure includes others who are not part of the PAYE scheme, such as seamstresses, pattern cutters, set designers, stylists, hair and makeup artists and people working for independent magazines. \u201cA lot of the creative industries are run by freelancers and the self-employed,\u201d says Jefferson Hack, CEO and co-founder of Dazed Media. \u201cFor them, this is an economic crisis.\u201d The very specific economic pattern under which the design industry operates (a complicated ecosystem where funds move between material manufacturers, shop buyers and design teams, all buffered by consumer demand) is being destroyed by the crisis \u2013 and young designers, in particular, are feeling the effects. \u201cThe supply chain, the inventory and all retail is shut down,\u201d says Hack. \u201cPeople think the system can move to e-commerce, but it\u2019s not that easy for young designers who are not big businesses to run an e-commerce system that is sustainable for them.\u201d One designer who is facing such challenges is Priya Ahluwalia whose label Ahluwalia was nominated for the prestigious LVMH award for Young Designers in March. \u201cOne of my biggest orders was cancelled,\u201d she says, adding that although Ahluwalia\u2019s Spring/Summer 2020 collection was bought by the prestigious retailers MatchesFashion and Browns before the pandemic, \u201cthey can\u2019t go live because the clothes can\u2019t be photographed\u201d. Many designers are finding themselves with unsold stock or excess material, as well as overheads such as studio rent which can\u2019t be paid. \u201cThe supply chain has stopped, so everything\u2019s stopped,\u201d says Ahluwalia. It is a similar story for the London based designer Feng Chen Wang, who was born in China. Currently quarantined in Shanghai, she says that the pandemic has affected three seasons, as her label produces mainly in China. \u201cFirst, SS20 was affected by the Chinese New Year closures that started in January, then, once the virus took hold and stores started closing, it meant they reduced SS20 deliveries. Then they reduced all forward orders for AW20,\u201d she says. \u201cNow China is slowly returning to work, but our European suppliers are still closed.\u201d She adds that many of her work plans have been derailed. \u201cWe were planning a new and exciting way to launch SS21 to market, which is now postponed. Our special collaboration projects have also been postponed. We had planned to open our own pop-up stores in London and New York, which now won\u2019t happen until much later in the year.\u201d To alleviate some of the pressure, the BFC has launched the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund (the deadline to apply is 13 April). Once applications close, it will allocate \u00a31m to the designer businesses that meet the criteria. Simultaneously, the BFC is actively fundraising and once it has raised \u00a3500,000, it will reopen applications to allocate this additional sum. Rush hopes the government and big businesses will get behind the initiative and supplement the financial contribution. Hack goes further: he wants the government to make interest-free loans of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000 available to struggling freelancers via banks. \u201cThey need to give the creative industries this life support, and it needs to be immediate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government needs to give housing benefit and protection from eviction for a minimum of six months on top of UBI (universal basic income).\u201d Fashion has been quick to respond to the pandemic, pivoting away from clothes manufacturing and towards helping with the medical crisis. It was announced last Saturday that Burberry would be helping make protective gowns for NHS workers, while LVMH has repurposed its fragrance factories to make 12 tonnes of hand sanitiser for 39 hospitals in France. While big brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent are producing masks and overalls. Ralph Lauren meanwhile has donated $10m to corona-related causes. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of how fashion has come through for the most vulnerable and needy with cash and resources,\u201d says Hack. Most recently Bethany Williams, Phoebe English and Holly Fulton have formed the Emergency Designer Network, which is helping the NHS with gown and mask production in response to the BFC\u2019s request for support. \u201cWe are aiming to bring together an initial network of 10 designers and makers across London who could support in the small-scale manufacturing of medical garments and face masks for medical teams, social careers and various support staff and key workers.\u201d says Williams. Hack describes them as \u201ca Dunkirk-like small flotilla of young designers\u201d. With many of June\u2019s fashion weeks now cancelled, Rush admits she is unsure what the future holds. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to imagine what a new normal will be,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter what we do, some business will go.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
