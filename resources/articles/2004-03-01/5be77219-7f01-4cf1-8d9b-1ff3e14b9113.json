One senior news executive at the BBC said the atmosphere has become \"cancerous\", with deep suspicion over why those leading the inquiry are not openly explaining whether any of the journalists being questioned are accused of wrongdoing. \"The truth is this has never been a benign process, even though they are trying to present it as such. The atmosphere is getting very, very bitter and very, very bloody.\" \"Nobody has put forward a single allegation of misconduct to anyone - and the thing is if you invoke the process, you have got to stick to the process. \"This has got a very arbitrary Guant\u00e1namo Bay feeling to it,\" said one executive. But other BBC insiders say the fears are unfounded. They say it is not a disciplinary inquiry and that there is no agenda, other than to establish what went wrong in the editorial process and how the corporation can ensure the same mistakes are not repeated. This was backed up by one executive closely involved with the Hutton inquiry. \"I don't know if it's a Guant\u00e1namo Bay. But what you could say is that a lot of people are saying it's just a fishing expedition. I don't see the purpose of it,\" said the source. The inquiry was set up by the corporation's acting director general, Mark Byford, in the immediate aftermath of the cataclysmic events that came in the wake of the publication of the Hutton report. Chairman Gavyn Davis, Mr Dyke and Andrew Gilligan - whose controversial Today programme report sparked the Hutton inquiry - all resigned from the BBC following Lord Hutton's findings. Headed by the BBC's director of policy and legal, Caroline Thomson, and Stephen Dando, the head of human resources, the inquiry team have already interviewed at least six people. These include the deputy head of news, Mark Damazer; Newsnight editor George Entwistle; the head of news, Richard Sambrook; Today assistant editor Miranda Holt and Today editor Kevin Marsh; and Mr Dyke. It is believed that Mr Dyke was interviewed last week. He agreed to attend the meeting out of courtesy, but it is understood he was surprised to be asked. He has persistently denounced Andrew Gilligan's critics and has always maintained that the broad thrust of Gilligan's report was right, although he has admitted some mistakes were made. 'There is a feeling the script has already been written' It is believed Andrew Gilligan was also asked to appear before the panel, but declined to be interviewed. However, Gilligan did make a further written submission expanding on points he felt had been underplayed or erroneously interpreted by Lord Hutton, who said the former BBC reporter's original allegation that the government inserted the 45-minute claim into the Iraq intelligence dossier knowing it to be wrong was \"unfounded\". One executive who has been interviewed said he felt despair at the process. \"There is a feeling the script has already been written.\" The inquiry was launched in a bid to establish whether lessons could be learned from the Gilligan affair, but several senior staff have protested that it has the appearance of yet another witch-hunt. It is known that Marsh, the editor the Today programme, fears for his position, and believes the inquiry is turning into a kangaroo court. Another executive said the inquiry was being likened internally to the \"Star Chamber\", the notorious medieval court. The BBC tried to reassure its most senior staff that the process is \"benign\" earlier this month, after senior figures including John Simpson, Jeremy Paxman and Andrew Marr penned a letter deploring the investigation. \"The atmosphere has worsened considerably in the last two weeks, \" said one journalist close to the Today programme. \"There is a worry and a fear about whether disciplinary proceedings are going to follow.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
