AUTIF figures show that in April this year net sales of Isas reached nearly \u00a31.4 million compared to about \u00a31.9 million in April 2000. Stock market volatility over the last year has made retail investors wary, particularly when it comes to putting money in higher risk sectors. The most popular sectors in April were the lower-risk balanced managed and bond sectors, as well as income funds. This sees a change from the same time last year when European companies were the favourite destination for investors' cash. Despite a drop in sales over the year to April, figures for the first quarter of this year show evidence of a growing confidence in the markets. Net Isa sales were up from nearly \u00a31.2m in March and Isa funds under management grew from \u00a318.8bn to \u00a321.1bn. Total net industry sales were also up by 91% from the year before, thanks largely to strong institutional sales. \"Net sales for the industry are almost double those for last year, reflecting the fact that in spite of market volatility and reduced new business levels, overall outflow of business has also fallen,\" said Clare Arber, spokesperson for AUTIF."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
