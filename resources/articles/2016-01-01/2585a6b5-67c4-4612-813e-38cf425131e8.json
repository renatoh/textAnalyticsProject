The innocent-looking house or barn harbouring horror and gore is as much a part of US film-making as the romcom. But it\u2019s possible the trope has never seemed as weird as this. Director Nicolas Pesce\u2019s tale about a country-dwelling family strikes an uncomfortable note from the first scene. A stranger (Will Brill) approaches the idyllic home of an American-Portuguese family, and once he\u2019s managed to worm his way into the house he kills the family\u2019s matriarch in the bath tub. From there things develop into something that sits between Almod\u00f3var\u2019s The Skin I Live In and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the father returns to seek vengeance, finally deciding to chain the attacker up in their barn. Scenes have next to no dialogue as the family of two, played by Paul Nazak and Kika Magalhaes, share short exchanges, with Annie (Magalhaes) tending to their hostage. From its black-and-white presentation to its minimalist construction the film cries out arthouse, but there\u2019s a sense it\u2019s trying way too hard. Scenes that should be shocking end up being strangely comical, like when Annie \u2013 now fully grown \u2013 picks up a woman at a bar (Clara Wong) and tells her matter-of-factly that she killed her father and enjoys dissecting cows\u2019 eyes, before murdering her and putting the body parts in the fridge. When the man who murdered her mother tries to escape, she captures him and kills him softly, hugging, kissing and stabbing him all at the same time, the incisions accompanied by squelching that makes the whole thing hard to take seriously. Annie\u2019s antics escalate and once she\u2019s got no one else to talk to (because she\u2019s killed everyone) she tries to find new victims. From the first moment she is picked up by a woman with a baby, it\u2019s obvious where things are going. Annie has another captive and now a child to raise as her own and presumably teach the pleasures of kidnapping and torture. What\u2019s never really presented is the motivation. Why is Annie running around stabbing everything in sight? How did her victim survive in a barn wearing nothing but a loincloth for several years? Pesce asks viewers to go along with the absurdity while offering nothing to justify any of it. It\u2019s a murder ballad gone out of tune."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
