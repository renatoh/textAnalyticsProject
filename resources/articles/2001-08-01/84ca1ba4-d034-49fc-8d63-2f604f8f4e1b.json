An early goal from Dion Dublin settled the game but with Villa going through to a final against Swiss side Basle on the away goals rule the late strike by Darius Vassell in the first leg proved more vital. All too often Aston Villa's best laid plans are sabotaged by an assortment of gremlins but on this occasion they began by adhering to the script. Manager John Gregory, heartened by the way David Ginola had tormented his compatriots after being introduced as a substitute during the first leg, gave the Frenchman a rare start. Gregory reasoned that with his team needing a victory to qualify for the final, Ginola was the likeliest lad to provide it. And he wasted little time in justifying his manager's faith by following suit to play a pivotal role in levelling the tie. Just three minutes had elapsed when Ginola moved smoothly through the gears down the left before delivering a cross for the unmarked Dion Dublin to volley home from close range. The goal coaxed Gregory away from his vantage point in the stands and into the dug-out where he fell foul of the fourth official before the end of the half for vigorously applauding when Ginola, of all people, clattered Stephane Gregoire. By then, Gregory's game plan should have been in need of drastic revision. That it was not was because the visitors wasted the best chance of the half. Cyril Yapi served notice that the Stade Rennais team were a threat when he volleyed wide after Peter Enckelman had pawed away a cross from Cyril Chapuis. Villa were fortunate within minutes of the restart when German referee Wolfgang Stark ignored the visitors' obvious claims for a penalty when Yapi was clearly held back by Alpay. Villa were fortunate to escape again when Danic went past George Boateng but his low cross failed to find a finishing touch. Aston Villa (4-4-2): Enckelman; Delaney, Alpay, Barry, Wright; Kachloul, Boateng, Hendrie, Ginola; Merson, Dublin. Stade Rennais (4-4-2): Durand; Gregoire, Diatta, Escude, Paisley; Yapi, Bigne, Danic, Vanderson; Monterrubio, Chapuis. Referee: W Stark (Germany)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
