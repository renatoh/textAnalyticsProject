The website for the Halos n Horns kids' shampoo, which Mr Massow has helped launch on the show, boasts it is approved by the Institute of Dermapaedics. Very reassuring - until you hear Mr Massow freely admit he made up the word (which apparently means children's skin) and created the institute. \"Lots of companies create words that don't exist which go with their mission statements,\" he says. \u00b7 The Department for Work and Pensions is prepared for every eventuality - including a gay prime minister. Although today's incumbent is firmly hetero, tax and pensions law has been rewritten to reflect the possibility this won't always be so. With civil partnerships launched next month, the bright sparks at PWC have noted that the section in the Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1972 which referred to the \"widow or widower\" of the PM, now adds \"... or surviving civil partner\". \u00b7 The organisers of the Broadband End Game conference have come up with a novel way of flogging sponsorship. They're auctioning on eBay the rights to sponsor the keynote speech by \"radical thinker\" and former chief BT techie, Peter Cochrane. Twenty bids are in, with ebiddermon leading at \u00a3626. Would-be sponsors have eight days left to bid. \u00b7 Labour MP for Northampton North Sally Keeble was certainly asking the tough questions when Financial Services Authority boss John Tiner appeared before the Treasury select committee yesterday. Was the FSA ever confused with the Food Standards Agency? she wondered. Welcoming a lighter moment in his parliamentary grilling, Mr Tiner responded that it may even be the Football Supporters Association. To which Ms Keeble replied: \"Oh, yes, I hadn't thought of that one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
