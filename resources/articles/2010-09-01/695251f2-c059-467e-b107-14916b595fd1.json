The film, starring Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning, was something of a surprise winner and not without controversy. It received mixed reviews here on the Lido but jury president Quentin Tarantino said it had been an unanimous decision from a jury that included screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, composer Danny Elfman and director Arnaud Desplechin. \"It enchanted us from the first,\" said Tarantino, \"and it grew and grew in our hearts, in our analysis, in our minds and affections. \"We kept coming back to it in discussions, even when talking about other films, because we found it kept illustrating what we were looking for in the winner of our Golden Lion.\" Coppola collected the award herself, receiving it from her former boyfriend Tarantino. \"I'm so proud to win the Golden Lion,\" she said, thanking her father \"for teaching me\". She said he and her mother were watching the ceremony on television at home in Napa, California. Before the festival began, Tarantino had been asked about the ethics of judging a film from a close friend. Defending himself from any accusations of favouritism, he said: \"That wasn't difficult at all. Being her friend didn't affect me or make me sway the jury in any way. \"Sure, I created guidelines but she won it fair and square and unanimously. \"The other members of the Jury don't know her at all. They just loved the film. We kept coming back to it, as one of us said, because 'it's a great fucking movie,' all right?\" Other surprising awards went to actor Vincent Gallo for his performance as a fugitive Afghan terrorist in Essential Killing. Best Actress went to Ariane Labed for Greek comedy Attenberg in which she played a young woman obsessed with the documentaries of Sir David Attenborough, whose mispronounced name forms the film's title. Another big success was Spanish film maker Alex de la Iglesia, who won two awards, for best screenplay and best director, for his extraordinary film about a rampaging clown, The Last Circus. Although the fourth woman to win the Golden Lion, Coppola's win struck another blow for her gender in the same year as Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman director to win an Oscar. \"Since I started making films, there have been more and more women directors coming through,\" she told the Observer later. \"It can only be good that there are different stories being told from different points of view.\" On the same day, actress Helen Mirren took on one of the great Shakespearean male roles as Prospero in The Tempest, dedicating her performance to the world's oppressed women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
