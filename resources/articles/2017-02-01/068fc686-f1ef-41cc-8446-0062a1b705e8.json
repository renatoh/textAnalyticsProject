Trump\u2019s comments as described by Shapiro appeared to suggest that some of the threats may have been manufactured for political reasons. Trump made similar remarks at a news conference earlier this month when asked about acts of discrimination, saying some incidents had been created by his opponents to generate negative media coverage. During a meeting at the White House with dozens of state attorneys general on Tuesday, Trump called the threats \u201creprehensible\u201d, said Shapiro, who summarized the president\u2019s remarks during a conference call with reporters. But Trump then added that \u201cthe reverse could be true\u201d and that the incidents could be aimed at making \u201csomeone else look bad\u201d, said Shapiro, a Democrat. The president\u2019s words came in response to a question from Shapiro about the threats. He said two of his children had to be evacuated from their day school on Monday. \u201cI found that statement to be a bit curious,\u201d Shapiro said, though he declined to speculate about what Trump may have meant. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said she was not part of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, referring to it as a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d, but said the president had always condemned antisemitic acts. \u201cWhat I do know is the conversations I have had with the president,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s been extremely clear and extremely consistent on this topic: any act of violence toward people of the Jewish faith is condemned by this administration.\u201c The discussion came a day after Jewish community centers and schools in at least 13 states reported receiving bomb threats, the fifth such wave this year. The incidents, which Shapiro said totaled 100, have alarmed Jewish groups fearful that antisemitism is on the rise. No explosives have been found in any of the incidents reported this year. The Mississippi attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, largely confirmed Shapiro\u2019s account. \u201cHe kind of said something to the effect: \u2018Maybe that was an insider job,\u2019\u201d Hood said. \u201cHe said something about: some of the time those situations happen to make another look bad.\u201d Another Democratic attorney general, Oregon\u2019s Ellen Rosenblum, said she was \u201cutterly confused\u201d by what Trump meant by \u201creverse\u201d. \u201cIt was a cordial exchange, so nobody followed up,\u201d Rosenblum said. Herbert Slatery, the Republican attorney general from Tennessee, said Trump clearly denounced the threats before engaging in what Slatery described as a \u201chypothetical\u201d. \u201cI thought it was fairly innocuous,\u201d Slatery said. The hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, a donor to Trump who was reportedly being considered for a White House position, made a connection in a tweet between the threats and Democrats. But he rejected the notion that he was implying Democrats were responsible. The president told the attorneys general that he would discuss the threats in his address to Congress on Tuesday night. Trump did not condemn the threats explicitly until last week, prompting criticism from Jewish leaders for what they viewed as a tepid response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
