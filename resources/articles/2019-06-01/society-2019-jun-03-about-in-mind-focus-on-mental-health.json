It is supported by a grant from theguardian.org. All of our journalism follows Guardian News and Media\u2019s published editorial code. The Guardian is committed to open journalism, recognising that the best understanding of the world is achieved when we collaborate, share knowledge, encourage debate and harness the expertise of specialists and their communities. The one restriction to content is that under US law theguardian.org is prevented from directly funding or earmarking funds to be used in an attempt to influence legislation within the meaning of Section 4945(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This means any communications to the public in which a view is expressed about a specific legislative proposal, and the recipients of the communications who are urged through a \u201ccall to action\u201d to contact government officials, must provide a reasoned, objective consideration of facts and issues in a full and fair manner that enables third parties to develop their own positions on any legislation that may be discussed. Unless otherwise stated, all statements and materials posted on the website, including any statements regarding specific legislation, reflect the views of the individual contributors and not those of theguardian.org."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
