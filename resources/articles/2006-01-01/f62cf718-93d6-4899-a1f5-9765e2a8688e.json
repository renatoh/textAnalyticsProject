Faded mechanics' institutes. Unitarian churches and Methodist chapels long abandoned by the non-conforming industrial faithful in the once sooty suburbs of northern towns ... these are just the sort of abandoned buildings that Save Britain's Heritage was set up to rescue 30 years ago, during what had been designated European Architectural Heritage Year. Britain's contribution to that event was, in the first three months of 1975 alone, 334 applications to demolish listed buildings. The rate at which these were disappearing was astonishing. It was as if the nation, for all its contemporary dismissal of modern architecture, was in a hurry to rid itself of at least two centuries of distinguished buildings as it ploughed with spectacular incompetence through the economic mire of the \"decade that design forgot\". The heroes of the mid-1970s, in the world of architectural conservation, were Marcus Binney, then editor of Country Life, and first and future president of Save, and John Harris, curator of the Royal Institute of British Architects' Drawing Collection. The conservation group they founded with historians, authors, curators, journalists and architects sprang from an exhibition curated for Roy Strong by Binney and Harris at the V&amp;A in 1974. This was The Destruction of the Country House, which drew an unexpectedly large and sympathetic audience. Well before Charles Sturridge's lavish TV series Brideshead Revisited, which brought country house style back into favour in the economically buoyant 1980s, the V&amp;A exhibition made people take notice of the wilful architectural blitz raging the length of Britain. Binney and Harris showed haunting pictures of 1,116 country houses demolished over the past century, a figure later revised to more than 1,600. This might have been cause for celebration to many of the last generation of working-class Labour politicians and old school trade unionists for whom country houses were anathema, yet what the founders of Save were showing at the V&amp;A was only the tip of an iceberg of much-liked, potentially re-usable and even glorious British architecture. This included handsome Regency working-class housing and magnificent railway stations designed for everyone, such as Glasgow St Enoch's, demolished in that destructive European Architectural Heritage Year 30 years ago. Thanks to Save's know-how, the press swung behind the conservation movement, as did public opinion. Today, with so many fine buildings saved and thriving with new uses, you might think Save would rest on its laurels. You would be wrong. In the back of a lively new book, Save Britain's Heritage 1975-2005: Thirty Years of Campaigning, are pictures of impressive buildings under threat. These include: the Collier Street Baths, Salford, one of the earliest surviving municipal bathhouses in Britain; Gwrych Castle, north Wales, an immense and sadly roofless folly designed by the entertainingly named Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh for himself from 1819; and Kinmel Hall in Denbighshire, north Wales, designed for the copper-rich Hughes family by WE Nesfield in the 1870s - an evangelical conference centre until it was abandoned after a fire, this country house is now empty. Nothing prepared me for the image on page 214 of the book. Set between these more or less commonplace Regency and Victorian hard-luck stories is a photograph of the stunning Renault Distribution Centre, Swindon, designed not by an architect with a high-starched collar and mutton chop facial hair, but by Norman Foster. It opened just 23 years ago. Here is an extraordinary thing: a fine modern building that looks all but brand new, designed by one of the world's most celebrated contemporary architects - and under threat. Foster was once the nemesis of Save. \"The only good architect,\" the audacious and brilliant architectural historian Gavin Stamp told me in a sadly unsaved pub called The Bride of Denmark, \"is a dead architect.\" Foster and his ilk were all too alive. That pub was an outpost of the Save brigade. It was also where a new generation of modern architects and writers who liked both old and new buildings met, too. It seems remarkable that, 20 years on from the time when the Renault building was sensationally new (and ready to play a starring role in the Bond film A View to a Kill), those champions of threatened British country houses and sworn enemies of all things new have become, rightly, concerned with the future of the very modern buildings they once decried. The truth is that the Save gang loved architecture. I suspect that more of them than would ever have admitted it at the time could see there was nothing inconsistent in professing admiration for the hi-tech yellow and steely grey lines of the new Renault Centre on the edge of Swindon and in being dismayed at the passing of St Enoch station. If any British architect had been truly influenced by such great engineering-driven structures it was, after all, Foster and his associates. For the most part, Save has been very successful. One of its greatest failures, however, was the campaign to stop the demolition of the delightful old Mappin &amp; Webb group of buildings in the City of London. The debate over the future of the site known as No 1 Poultry led to three heated public inquiries. Save lost and had costs of \u00a390,000 awarded against it. In 1997, a bizarre new postmodern building by James Stirling and Michael Wilford opened on the site. Significantly, many of the expert witnesses called to undermine the Victorian buildings were those for whom Foster's Renault design was the ne plus ultra of a black polo-necked, hi-tech future. Who knows, perhaps one day Save will even fight to save Stirling and Wilford's No 1 Poultry when this rough beast slouches towards some future of even more demanding property development than existed in the gung-ho, shoulder-padded 1980s when the future of the Mappin &amp; Webb buildings was sealed. The future of the Renault Building, meanwhile, looks assured. That it was ever at risk should have been a matter for concern, because this was one of the buildings that showed the world what British architects could do, and led the way for Foster, among others, to design globally. But a question mark had hung over the listed structure - it was recognised as deserving of listing almost as soon as it opened - ever since Renault abandoned one old railway town, Swindon, for another, Derby, where it moved this part of its operations to in 2001. Now, after the campaigning, the building is to be rescued not by Swindon itself, nor even solely by Save, but by Jubilee International, a Chinese consortium committed to transforming the empty Foster building, now known as Spectrum, into a trading post for Chinese goods and services. It is significant that it is the Chinese who have come to the rescue of the Foster building. Foster has, of course, designed some of his most ambitious and finest buildings in China, including the new airports at Hong Kong and Beijing and the exquisite HSBC headquarters. A Chinese trading post in the heart of what was Britain's manufacturing industry might seem ironic, yet it is appropriate in two senses: one, the Chinese admire Foster; two, we Britons living in the new golden age like nothing better than shopping for Chinese manufactured goods - the same goods we now find so hard to make. Alan Hayward of the Swindon Civic Trust, which has campaigned for the building's listing along with Save and the Twentieth Century Society, has said that \"the market's simply not there for industrial space\". Now Save and other heritage bodies should watch what actually happens to the former Renault building. Perhaps the Chinese will look after it better than we can. What is certain is that, 30 years on, Save is still needed to make us all stop and look carefully before destroying buildings that future generations will love more than the big, shiny, short-lived new shopping malls that are often slated to replace them \u00b7 Save Britain's Heritage 1975-2005: Thirty Years of Campaigning is published by Scala, price \u00a320"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
