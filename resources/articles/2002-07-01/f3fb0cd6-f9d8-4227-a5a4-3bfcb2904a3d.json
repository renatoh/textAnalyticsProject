In gloomy conditions and on a difficult pitch, the Queenslander hit a masterful 66 from 77 balls, without which Lancashire's bowlers would have had nothing to defend. Law has a two-year contract and Lancashire have approached Harbhajan on the basis that the counties will be allowed to employ two overseas players from next year. Indians seem to be all the rage at the moment, with Hampshire confirming last week that they have opened negotiations with Sachin Tendulkar. He will not come cheap, so the near-capacity crowd who rolled up to the Rose Bowl on this chilly, grey evening will have given their coffers, as well as the advocates of floodlit cricket, a timely boost. The Hampshire players responded with an impressive display of out-cricket, as an excellent opening spell from Dimitri Mascarenhas thrust Lancashire on to the back foot and a string of spectacular catches kept them there. Mascarenhas sent back Glen Chapple and Mark Chilton in bowling his eight overs straight through for only 19 runs in a match reduced to 40 overs per side by a brief shower. Nic Pothas, the South African wicketkeeper with a Greek passport who took a low diving catch to dismiss Chilton, added another before Hegg had scored, and Neil Johnson snapped up Neil Fairbrother for another duck low down in the slips. But Derek Kenway earned the biggest roar with a spectacular effort, sprinting in from deep cover to break Law's seventh-wicket stand of 40 with Gary Yates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
