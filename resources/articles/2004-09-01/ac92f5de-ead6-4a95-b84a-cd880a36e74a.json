Tour operators have reported a surge of inquiries about the region this month. Dragoman and Journey Latin America are offering themed Che Guevara trips following in the footsteps of the revolutionary icon. 'In the first three weeks of August when there was a lot of hype about the film, we did see a dramatic increase in bookings of about 50 per cent,' said a spokeswoman for Trailfinders. A spokesman for South American specialist Drago man said inquiries were double that of last year. 'We learnt from experience that whenever a major film like this comes out, interest in the place increases. It happened with Out of Africa and Gorillas in the Mist .' Journey Latin America said its website had received a record number of hits during the past two weeks. People have been inspired by scenes of Che and his companion tearing across the pampas on a motorbike, crossing Lago Nahuel Huapi lake between Argentina and Chile, hiking through the Andes and those of Che exploring a deserted Machu Picchu - but don't expect to find the same conditions, the site now has 300,000 foreign visitors a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
