In the circumstances, it will be quite an achievement if, as the bookies predict, at least two of the Europeans return as winners. Five of the eight Breeders Cup races have at least two European-trained entries, although Luca Cumani has yet to decide whether Falbrav, an entry in the $4m (\u00a32.4m) Classic, will run in that event on dirt, or stick to grass in the Turf and chase half as much cash. Apart from Oasis Dream, a top-priced 11-2 for the Mile with Coral, Britain will send Islington to the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, in which she finished a solid third 12 months ago, where she will be joined by Godolphin's Mezzo Soprano. Another Godolphin runner, Sulamani, the ante-post favourite for the Turf, completes the team. Ireland has 10 confirmed entries, including seven from Aidan O'Brien's yard, headed by High Chaparral (Turf) and Hold That Tiger (Classic), while the two challengers from France, Bright Sky (Filly &amp; Mare Turf) and Six Perfections (Mile) both hold leading chances. This year's meeting marks the Breeders Cup's 20th anni versary, and the sixth time the card has been held in California. Overall, the Europeans have a respectable strike-rate of nearly 17%, particularly since events such as the Distaff, Sprint and Juvenile Fillies, all on dirt, are usually seen as out of bounds. Backing the visitors, especially in the Mile, is not advisable, however, until the draw for post positions has been made next Wednesday. The run from the start to the first bend in the Mile is barely 100 yards, and high-drawn horses will be at a big disadvantage. \"If you get anything above seven or eight [of 14] there's a big sigh and your stomach sinks a bit,\" Gosden said. \"If it was a one-turn mile [for Oasis Dream] I'd have a fair bit of confidence. The two-turn mile could be a bit of a crap-shoot.\" The decision on Falbrav's ultimate destination at Santa Anita may not be made until early next week. Cumani is flying to California on Tuesday, and hopes to hear from the five-year-old's owners by Monday evening. \"The decision is not mine,\" he said yesterday. \"All I can do is assure them that he is in good form. When it comes down to choosing the target, it is an almost philosophical matter for the owners. \"Basically it comes down to whether you want to take a chance [in the Classic] that he might be remembered as one of the all-time greats, or play it safe [in the Turf] and go down as one of the very good ones.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
