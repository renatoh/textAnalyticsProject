Liverpool travel to Munich in three weeks\u2019 time without the commanding first-leg lead that characterised their run to last season\u2019s Champions League final following the goalless draw with the German champions. Mats Hummels, the Bayern defender, said the last-16 tie was balanced but that Niko Kovac\u2019s team were satisfied with the result and their gameplan. Wijnaldum, however, believes keeping a clean sheet without Virgil van Dijk, Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez in defence was significant, and that a greater show of ambition from Bayern in front of their own fans will benefit Liverpool. Tuesday was only the fourth time in 35 matches this season that Klopp\u2019s team have failed to score. Three of the shut-outs have come in the Champions League and Liverpool lost all three away matches in the group stage yet Wijnaldum denies the Anfield result suited Bayern. \u201cIs it a better result for them? Why? I think it is a good result for both,\u201d the Liverpool midfielder said. \u201cIf we go there and score a goal they have to score two. One of the advantages is that they will play at home. I think a lot of teams when they come to Anfield and they play a draw they think it is a good result. I don\u2019t think it is a bad result for them but neither is it for us. \u201cThe way we are playing we have the quality to create chances so that is why I am happy we didn\u2019t concede. I am not really worried about scoring goals. We already show we can do it in the games before so we just have to do it again. Hopefully we have a little more luck with the chances.\u201d Wijnaldum is unconvinced that Kovac will play a more expansive game and expose his team to Liverpool\u2019s quality on the counterattack. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will play really open because they know we are good on the counterattack but they also know we score goals with good football and create chances. It\u2019s difficult to say how the game is going to go but it is going to be a tough one.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s attention has switched to Sunday\u2019s crucial Premier League visit to Manchester United, where Wijnaldum expects a different proposition to the team brushed aside 3-1 at Anfield in December in what proved to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s final game as United manager. \u201cI think it is going to be a real big change,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the new manager came in there is a new flow, they played good games and have won a lot and that is building confidence in the team. It\u2019s also a home game for them so they will have a lot of confidence as they don\u2019t have the problems they had before.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
