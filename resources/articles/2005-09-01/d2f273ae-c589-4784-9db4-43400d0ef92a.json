But the East Lothian power plant is about to become one of the most spectacular art installations in Britain. Ricky Demarco, a Scottish arts impresario, is planning to project art on to the huge structure. The first piece will be a six-minute film by the artist Ken McMullen, Lumen De Lumine, exploring the relationship between science and art. The film will run on continuous loop for a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
