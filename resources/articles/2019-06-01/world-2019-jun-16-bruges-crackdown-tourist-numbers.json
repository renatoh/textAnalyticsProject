Clutching phones or maps, and with backpacks firmly strapped on, they swarm with purpose in the direction of the Flemish city\u2019s cathedral, the spire of which is just visible over the top of the sycamore and oak trees that act as a break between the modern suburbs and transport hubs and one of the world\u2019s best-preserved medieval centres. But watching the tourists pass by his souvenir shop on the way to the sites this weekend, 61-year-old Paul Jonckheere was struggling to maintain his naturally cheerful demeanour. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this \u2013 why would the mayor do it?\u201d Jonckheere asked. \u201cI can\u2019t understand this at all.\u201d The city of Bruges, a Unesco world heritage site, last week became just the latest stop on the global tourist trail to question the philosophy that more is better when it comes to visitors. Last week the mayor, Dirk De fauw, elected in October under the slogan \u201cGo with De fauw\u201d, announced that the municipality would no longer advertise or promote day trips to the city. Measures would also be taken to cut back the number of cruise ships able to dock at nearby Zeebrugge from five a day to just two. Cruise companies will also be asked to dock during the week rather than at weekends to help spread the crowds. \u201cWe have to control the influx more if we don\u2019t want Bruges to become a complete Disneyland here,\u201d De fauw told the Flemish TV channel VRT in a news item that was picked up by media outlets around the world. Bruges is visited by 8.3 million people a year, up 28% in the last two years, and yet just 2.5 million of those spend a night. Too few of those filling the cobbled streets and sun-dappled squares are spending money when they come, instead being shipped in and shipped out within hours of arrival, but also breaking the calm serenity of the city, De fauw said. Tourists recognise that there is a problem. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it but there are too many people,\u201d said Eli Sabbair, 36, from Iran, standing under Bruges\u2019s belfry tower. But Jonckheere, along with his brother Daniel, who inherited the shop on Katelijnestraat in 1990 from their parents, Joseph and Lucette, greeted the news with understandable dismay. Not everyone was pleased when the Jonckheere brothers switched from selling poultry to flogging Bruges-branded merchandise and Belgian beers to tourists. But travellers outnumber residents in Bruges city centre by about three to one. \u201cAnd it is much harder work to sell chicken \u2013 a lot more controls,\u201d said Jonckheere. \u201cThe younger people all buy their food from the big supermarkets anyway, Carrefour and Delhaize. That is how it is now. A lot of people in this city live off tourism. OK, not everyone spends money when they come, but many do.\u201d Daniel, who is president of the local retailers\u2019 association, will make his feelings clear to the mayor at a meeting over the coming weeks. Under the shade of the sycamores by the city\u2019s monastery, Nick Notre Dame, 39, was tending to his horse and carriage as he waited for customers. \u201cYou can never have enough tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mayor has got this wrong. But it is true that not enough people stay for very long. The groups move through very fast, they have no time to do anything, and they all have a budget \u2013 and they don\u2019t go over it.\u201d The grumblings of some of the 120,000 who live in Bruges have not gone unnoticed by De fauw, who was born and bred in the city \u2013 a place, he said, that was generally at ease with itself. Highly affluent, with unemployment no higher than 5%, Bruges broke with the rest of Flanders in last year\u2019s elections by choosing De fauw, a candidate with a liberal approach to migration, rather than the strident approach championed by the far-right nationalist Vlaams Belang party, which made substabtial gains in the region. Over a coffee in a cafe on the Kraanplein, the city\u2019s burgemeester explained that his move was in keeping with a series of decisions that had allowed Bruges to maintain its attraction to locals and visitors alike. \u201cThere are 13 central cities in Flanders,\u201d said De fauw. \u201cBruges is the third biggest behind Antwerp and Ghent. And for something like 12 or 14 years we have come top when the people were asked in a survey whether they are proud of their city. It is said that 90% are proud of their city \u2013 and we want to keep it like this.\u201d In 1996 there was a ban on building new hotels in the city centre, and in 2002 there was a prohibition on holiday homes. \u201cNow we are looking at the areas outside the city centre \u2013 such as Sint Andries \u2013 to see if we need to do the same there on holiday homes. Otherwise we will end up with no one living in Bruges. We are not like Amsterdam yet \u2013 and we will provide to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cWe want the people who stay in our hotels, who go to restaurants, who buy something in the shops, but we will not promote for those tourists who just come a few hours to Bruges,\u201d De fauw added. \u201cThey have a quick walk around Bruges, they walk as quickly as possible, they do not buy anything and they go back to the bus, and go back to the hotel for a meal, in Antwerp, Brussels or Ghent.\u201d \u201cWhen you come to the city it must be a little bit slowly, you don\u2019t have to hurry up and spend three hours with a guide. They don\u2019t have the time to sit on a terrace and have a tea or beer \u2013 no, they have no time. They are disturbing a little bit the charming character of our city.\u201d De fauw said he was concerned about the shops in his city since he had noticed via his own children how online purchasing was becoming the norm. \u201cMy son bought three jackets and I asked why he needed three jackets, but he was just going to send two back once he had tried them on,\u201d De Fauw said. \u201cI want to help the shops too. \u201cWhen you have tourists who don\u2019t stay a long time they go to just one part of the city, and the shops there are fixed on tourists. So what do they sell? Chocolate and beer. The inhabitants of Bruges don\u2019t recognise their own city. They see no clothes shops, butchers, bakers. Only chocolate and beer.\u201d De fauw\u2019s big project is the completion of a new conference centre in town to bring in the right sort of tourists who will purchase clothes, jewellery and other locally made products. But the mayor said he was also looking at the municipality renting shops that came on the market so it could then regulate what was sold in them. In the 2008 black comedy film In Bruges, Colin Farrell\u2019s hitman character is driven mad by the picture-book perfection and gentleness of the city. \u201cAn important part of that film was at night,\u201d De fauw said. \u201cThat is when the city is at its most beautiful, when it is so calm and you can walk along the canals, and it so quiet you can even hear doors opening. That\u2019s what I want everyone to enjoy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
