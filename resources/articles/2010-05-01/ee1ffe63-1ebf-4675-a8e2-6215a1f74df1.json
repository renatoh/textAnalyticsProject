White to play. The Catalan opening gave Anand two wins in the world championship, and has long been popular among the world's elite. It is basically a Queen's Gambit in which White fianchettos. It can be reached via several different move orders, for example: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 g3, or 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 d5 4 Bg2. The bishop is tricky on the long diagonal, and the fianchetto provides a safe king position after castling. RB I've always tended to get the Catalan confused with the Bogo-Indian, various Benoni systems, and even the fianchetto variation of the King's Indian, and so given it a wide berth. The themes and ideas behind it are, to me, very murky. Perhaps this kind of position is characteristic of the Catalan \u2013 who knows? Not me anyway. All I can see is that the retreat 1 Nf3 dxe4 2 Qxe4 Re8 gives Black a pleasant position. After 3 Qc2 (or perhaps 3 Qb1) Black could play 3... Be6 and suddenly the phalanx of black queenside pawns looks very worrying. But if the retreat is passive, what's the alternative? Is there a sacrifice on c6? It looks as if there should be, but I can't see how to make it work. Likewise it's tempting to leave the knight on e5 and look for some way to unbalance Black \u2013 except that I can't find it either. Over to the grandmaster. DK Black's last move \u2013 pawn to f6 \u2013 provokes a crisis. If White backs down, as Ronan demonstrates, he will give Black time to develop. Kramnik realised he had to strike: 1 exd5, giving up the knight, but opening up the diagonal of the Catalan bishop. After 1...fxe5 2 bxc4 the position had switched round \u2013 White suddenly had the dangerous mass of pawns, and that, combined with the weakness of Black's king, led to victory. Kramnik has been the greatest exponent of the Catalan in recent times, playing it in a far more aggressive fashion than was characteristic of games in the 1980s. More from him next week. chess@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
