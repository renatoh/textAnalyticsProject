So, here in our Dorset village, we are now ready to confront any disaster, from global terrorism to tsunamis. Both are mentioned in the plan, drawn up by Dorset county council and the Dorset Local Resilience Forum (motto: \"Plan, Respond, Recover\"). What we have to do to implement the TPC-SHEP is make a list of useful things that we would be glad to lay hands on. Suggested items include generators, rubble-clearing equipment, wells with drinkable water (how does one tell?), tractors with lifting gear, qualified first aiders, portable toilets and so on. We also have to identify potential landing spots for helicopters, locations for emergency accommodation, mobile-phone blackspots and main routes into the community (\"eg road and rail\", the TPC-SHEP helpfully suggests). It's the task of the hapless parish council chairman to traipse around the village counting radio hams, power lines, extra-large Thermos flasks and so on. We are also supposed to nominate couriers for \"carrying written or verbal messages\" in case the phones go down while the roads are impassable. The plan also provides a helpful list of resources, including the BBC's news service. It seems rather touching to assume that whatever may happen, the BBC will continue to broadcast to the bitter end. It's reminiscent of a cross between Dad's Army and a John Wyndham novel - and when the BBC goes off-air in one of those you know you're really in trouble. This fine science fiction writer is starting to look less and less dated as the years go by. In a typical Wyndham scenario, by chapter five or six the world is underwater (The Kraken Wakes) or overrun with genetically modified walking plants (The Day of the Triffids). John Christopher, another excellent 50s writer, is also looking scarily plausible at the moment, with his novels World in Winter, which predicts a new ice age, and No Blade of Grass, in which food crops are wiped out by a rapidly mutating virus. And under such circumstances, especially with no TPC-SHEP to turn to, things rapidly turn very nasty indeed. Both writers explore what happens when large populations start getting very hungry. And one thing they don't do is think: \"Oh, that generator clearly belongs to this village and so, indeed, do those sacks of potatoes. We'd better move on quietly.\" Our TPC-SHEP list is noticeably lacking in anything along the lines of weapons and, as any Wyndham/Christopher reader knows, the first thing you look for when disaster kicks off is a rifle or three. When the water levels start rising and the food runs low, a list of first-aid boxes and portable toilets isn't going to hold back the forces of evil for long. What we'd really need to do would be to requisition the largest house in the village, nail wood over the windows, set up booby traps and get every able-bodied person busy with target practice. \"I reckon you'd last two or three days at most,\" said a friend who works in the sustainable-energy field and thus knows about these things. \"Once the hordes started marauding, you wouldn't stand a chance. The only people who will be all right are the military, because they've got guns.\" Perhaps they might allocate us the odd rat to gnaw on if we offer to share our emergency battery-powered radios and sticking plasters - if they arrive in time to save us from the ravening population of Shaftesbury. hester_lacey@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
