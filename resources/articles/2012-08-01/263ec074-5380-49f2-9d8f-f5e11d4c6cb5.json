By taking out Bulgaria's Detelin Dalakliev on a close 16-15 count the Hull bantamweight reached the semi-finals and guaranteed himself a bronze. Five of his team-mates have quarter-finals on Monday. In the women's inaugural Olympic competition Nicola Adams (56kg), Natasha Jonas (60kg) and Savannah Marshall (75kg) all hope to join Campbell, as do the middleweight Anthony Ogogo and Anthony Joshua, the super-heavyweight. On Tuesday Andrew Selby (flyweight) and Fred Evans (welterweight) hope to win and secure a bronze, while on Wednesday it is the turn of the light-welterweight Tom Stalker. Campbell has already made his fantasy of an Olympic medal real. \"I dreamed all my life for this, just for one moment,\" the world silver medallist said. \"Getting a medal means everything to me \u2013 all my sacrifices, all the sweat will be paid off. The crowd is fantastic, I have never felt anything like this. Never seen anything like this. I am happy to be a part of the Great Britain team.\" He now meets the Irishman John Joe Nevin for a place in the final. Campbell's victory came in a rematch of the 2008 European final, when he defeated Dalakliev on countback and he beat the Bulgarian again last autumn on the way to world silver. It was close due to questionable judging once more coming into play. Surprisingly Dalakliev was given the opening round, 4-3. Campbell stormed the second round yet the score came back 5-5, meaning he was a point behind as the last three minutes began. Campbell took the fight to his opponent, his quicker hands stinging Dalakliev behind the southpaw stance. If Campbell appeared to win this round the easiest yet, there was still the judges' decision to consider. This time they got it right and 8-6 for the final round gave Campbell the victory. \"The opponent was very tough, one of the best kids I have beaten,\" he said. \"I don't know what was going through my mind in the third round. I just knew I had to come back to the ring and adapt. I just had to give everything. It was very nerve racking.\" Jonas, Britain's first female Olympic boxer, emphatically beat Quanitta Underwood, 21-13. \"It was brilliant. I've come here to box, first and foremost, and anything that you get along the way is a bonus. But to make history and to break records is something that no one else can ever take away from you. So I'm really proud of myself and I just want to do my country proud.\" The afternoon session at the ExCeL consisted of the 12 last-16 bouts in the women's competition. These were spread across three weights, 51kg, 60kg \u2013 Jonas's division \u2013 and 75kg. The bill included Mary Kom, the five-times consecutive world champion at 46kg, who on the date of her five-year-old twins' birthday had moved up a weight to compete. The Indian, 29, dispatched Poland's much bigger Karolina Michalczuk with the session's most impressive display, 19-14. A bye was given to the Republic of Ireland's Katie Taylor, whom Jonas fights next on Monday in the quarter-finals. Considered the pound-for-pound queen, Taylor, 26, has won four world championships at 60kg in the last six years. She is also the European champion of the last four years and was Ireland's flag bearer at the opening ceremony \"If you want to be Olympic champion there's not going to be any easy bouts and Katie's a great performer, the world champion, she's class,\" Jonas said. \"I know her strengths, she knows my strengths, so hopefully the best person will win on the day but I'm going to be ready.\" Jonas lost to Taylor 6-3 at a tournament in Turkey last year. \"I gave her a bit too much respect, because at the time I was quite new on the international scene and I was a bit in awe. \"But times have changed and I'm 50 bouts on from then, so next time it'll be different.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
