Thinking about the one-a-day principle, how should I store them? Adam M A Adam, such apples are too good for just one a day. They need to be kept cool and dry and not touching one another. An uncle of mine used to wrap his individually in newspaper and then pack them into cardboard boxes. He claimed that it worked a treat, and they emerged crisp and unblemished. It is worth giving them a good check-over before you wrap them and eat any bruised ones quickly - they won't store. If you might receive such a gift regularly, you can buy apple storage boxes, both simple and elaborate, from gardenware catalogues. Q What can I do with Hunza apricots? They look so boring. Chipper A I love these little apricots. They look less than promising, I admit, but they swell up in water (or wine, or fruit juice) to plump little fruits that can be poached in syrup or apple juice, or eaten as they are. They are good for adding to lamb stews and tagines, and are best slow-cooked, but I most like them straight out of the packet - they're the fruit world's answer to cubes of fudge. Q Is there any point in paying for unwaxed lemons and oranges? I'm not sure I see the point. David A David, try this: wash a waxed lemon under a hot tap and you will feel the wax all over your hands. Now, do you really want that in your dinner? \u00b7If you have a cooking question for Nigel, email ask.nigel@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
