Fascinating facts I have learned this week are that hamsters are colour-blind, the French for toad is crapaud, and the marshmallow has been around, in one form or other, for over 2,000 years. Which leads me to the partial theme of this month's column: the marshmallow challenge. In his book Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman retells the story of a group of American scientists who created a specific torture for four-year-olds. A scientist places a marshmallow on a table, telling the four-year-old that the scientist is off on an errand, and that if the child can resist the temptation to eat the marshmallow, they may gorge themselves on an extra one on the scientist's return. Some kids manage to resist temptation; some don't. The children are tracked and, 14 years later, their results in the marshmallow test prove to be a more reliable indicator of academic success than an IQ test. On leaving college, those who had practised self-restraint and held out for the second marshmallow all became straight-A students, while those unable to practise such superhuman self-control ended up as drug-addicted crazies. Goleman takes this story as proof of the vast importance of impulse control, the master aptitude of emotional intelligence. I have a different interpretation. The kids who resisted temptation were idiots. What kind of fool wastes 20 minutes in torture for the sake of a single marshmallow? Eat the bloody thing the moment you are given it, and ask the scientist whether, since he is going on an errand, he could make a brief diversion to pick you up a family-sized pack of marshmallows. There are those who suggest we should incorporate teaching of the \"soft skills\" of emotional intelligence, of which the marshmallow test is merely a whimsical illustration, into the curriculum. And, cheap gags aside, I empathise with them. This is an area where, for once, the real radicalism seems to be coming from the private sector. Antony Seldon's introduction last year of a wellbeing curriculum at Wellington College attracted a barrage of press attention, with Ann Widdecombe hilariously describing it as \"the nanny state gone mad\" (Wellington is not a state institution). The lessons, written by a Cambridge don, Dr Nick Baylis, and delivered by an absolute pearl of a teacher, Ian Morris, appear to be the start of a movement in British education. This month, more than 200 headteachers, journalists and dignitaries attended a conference at Wellington on the subject. I went to the school earlier this year to sit in on one of these happiness lessons. I travelled with one chief concern: that the lessons were being used as a sophisticated deflection tactic, permitting the school to pour ever more intense pressure on its pupils. Pop 'em the curricular equivalent of an anti-depressant, and you can get the bosun to crack the whip all the harder. However, suspicions that Seldon's intentions are in any way disingenuous are dispelled within seconds in his company. He explains: \"Teachers, like parents, want the children in their care to be mentally and physically healthy and intelligent in the roundest possible sense, and that's what teaching the skills of wellbeing is all about. Research and practice suggests it should be introduced in every school as a matter of priority.\" I interviewed the young men in year 10 and, without exception, they claimed to have enjoyed and benefited greatly from the lessons. If socially advantaged young men, who spend their school years within Wellington's idyllic, wooded acres, can benefit from such lessons, how great could the benefits be to those in less advantaged situations? Seldon acknowledges this: \"There is no more important objective for a school than to help its pupils find out who they are and how to lead happy and decent lives. The more deprived the area, the more vital this version of schooling is.\" Admittedly, financial straits are not the only form of poverty (it would be wrong to discount the emotional deprivation experienced by those at a boarding school like Wellington), but Seldon is right. The ability to recognise happiness when it occurs and to have it identified as something, perhaps the only thing, worth aspiring to is not, as one critic has put it, Orwellian or Stalinist, but a fundamental of decent schooling. If you don't know something exists, you cannot realistically aim for it. This applies equally to social mobility, which is also markedly absent from the curriculum. And, at a time when the government is all too happy to criminalise children by trialling random drugs testing, the pursuit of happiness lessons are surely worth a large-scale trial themselves. Of course, you cannot promote social cohesion with missionary zeal alone, but people happy in themselves tend not to look too hard for scapegoats in other communities. So, if lessons in emotional intelligence and wellbeing are to find a way on to the curriculum, then where better to put them than in place of the failed citizenship experiment? Teaching kids how to be happy in themselves and to empathise with each other is surely more likely to promote social cohesion than teaching them to salute the flag, and if the marshmallow test is such a sure sign of future attainment, then a version of it should find its way on to the menu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
