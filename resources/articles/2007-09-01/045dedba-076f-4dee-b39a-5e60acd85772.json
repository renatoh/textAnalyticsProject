Having waited until February to score his first top-flight goal last season, the Watford forward struck twice here, taking his tally to five in three matches, to lift Aidy Boothroyd's side above Bristol City and back to the Championship summit. Victory was barely deserved against a promising Cardiff City side but the merits of the three points mattered little to Watford's triumphant supporters. With 15 points gleaned from a possible 18, Watford are setting a pace which suggests there is no hangover from relegation. The visitors could hardly be described as pleasing on the eye but the uncompromising style that failed in the Premier League continues to bring success at this level. Cardiff enjoyed more possession than their often one-dimensional opponents but there was a ruthless edge to Watford, epitomised by Henderson's finishing. With Robbie Fowler and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink up front, Cardiff ought to have matched Watford in that department but 19 attempts and only one goal tells its own story. Hasselbaink was Cardiff's scorer, curling a low 25-yard shot beyond the excellent Mart Poom to register his first goal for the club. It was a landmark which provided little consolation, Watford condemning Cardiff to a third successive home defeat of a season that appears best spent on the road. That is where all Cardiff's points have come from hitherto, with this fixture threatening to end that sequence until Henderson, exploiting a poorly executed offside trap after a Watford corner was half-cleared, drilled home with 12 minutes remaining. Henderson's earlier strike, coming just past the quarter-hour mark, arrived after another set piece, with Jay DeMerit eventually turning Adam Johnson's deep free-kick against the post before the striker prodded in. \"We are not bad at set plays and we have done plenty of work on them,\" said Boothroyd. \"It's great that it's come off.\" He admitted that his side had \"ridden our luck\" and \"weathered the storm\" although he took encouragement from the knowledge that three points could be collected despite being second best. \"The pleasing thing for me is we have ground out a result not playing particularly well,\" added Watford's manager. Boothroyd's admission that Poom was the man of the match was further testimony to Cardiff's dominance. The former Sunderland and Derby goalkeeper produced fine saves to thwart Hasselbaink and Paul Parry early on and later repelled Trevor Sinclair's angled drive, when the scores were level and the winger might have crossed for Fowler to touch in. \"It would have been an easy goal,\" lamented Dave Jones, Cardiff's manager. Jones bemoaned the source of Watford's goals, criticising his players for \"a lack of concentration\". That tendency to switch off was punished by Henderson, who despite scoring four times in four days is still not guaranteed a starting place at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday, according to Boothroyd. \"We are very pleased with the start,\" added the Watford manager. \"But I don't think we will see the best of this team until January or February.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
