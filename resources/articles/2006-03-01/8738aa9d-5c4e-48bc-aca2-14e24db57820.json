Pompey had picked up one point from a possible 21 in a calamitous sequence in which the nadir was a 5-0 defeat at the home of their survival rivals Birmingham on January 21. But as the passes fizzed around West Ham's bewildered back four on Saturday it became clear that confidence is coursing through this team. Pedro Mendes's 90th-minute winner at home to Manchester City seven days previously had been an epiphany. That goal, and the three points it yielded, leavened the mood at Pompey's Eastleigh training ground last week, allowing the visitors to approach this match with twinkling eyes and a view to victory. \"Since January the atmosphere in the dressing room has changed massively,\" said the Portsmouth captain Gary O'Neil. \"We were struggling up until that month, struggling for points and goals. Three weeks ago people were saying it was us and Sunderland who were down but we have picked up six points in a week and that has put us right back in with a shout. \"There is a belief about the place now. Scoring in the last minute against Manchester City was a terrific boost for the club. Last week's win gave us a real boost and we have managed to carry that on. It puts big pressure on the rest of the teams down there, especially Birmingham and West Brom who have a few tough games coming up now.\" Harry Redknapp - returning to Upton Park for the first time in an official capacity since his sacking as West Ham manager five years ago - was widely derided in January for his decision to invest in midfielders and strikers, leaving a deficient defence almost untouched. But the wisdom of that decision is slowly becoming apparent as he set out a side with the accent on adventure. It paid off spectacularly here. Fitness is returning to the atrophied muscles of Mendes and Sean Davis, midfielders who were underemployed at Tottenham but whose obvious quality has come as a boon to their new paymasters. In front of them was Andres D'Alessandro, whose presence unsettled the ageing Christian Dailly. The Scot was nominally West Ham's midfield shield but he was constantly confused by the blur of the Argentinian's quick feet. \"Pedro Mendes, Sean Davis did brilliantly, as did D'Alessandro - the whole midfield did really well,\" said O'Neil. \"It was a bit of a slow start with so many players coming in but it seems to be taking off now. Since Pedro has come in he has been different class in training but is now producing that in matches as well. All the players are drawing on his experience. When things are going wrong he points to what he thinks it is in the dressing room.\" Mendes, a European Cup winner with Jose Mourinho's Porto in 2004, added another long-range goal here with a strike of immense quality. \"We are telling Pedro to shoot from anywhere at the moment because whatever he seems to hit they are going in,\" said O'Neil. \"Pedro has great technique and if he keeps on scoring like that then Portsmouth will be OK.\" Mendes's was the only one of Portsmouth's four goals that was not scored from within the six-yard box, a fact that underlines the quality of their passing. A narrow midfield was supported assiduously by the advancing full-backs, whose crosses provided the first two goals, the opener well met by Lomana Lualua at the far post from Matt Taylor's driven left-wing cross; the second provided for Davis from the right by Brian Priske. However, Arsenal, Portsmouth's visitors this Saturday, are unlikely to collaborate in their own downfall as West Ham, distracted by tonight's FA Cup quarter- final against Manchester City, did here. The Hammers' two goals, through Teddy Sheringham and Yossi Benayoun, came too late to have any effect on the match. So disappointing were the hosts that despite the four goals they conceded their best player was the goalkeeper Jimmy Walker in his first senior game since a cruciate-ligament injury sustained in last season's play-off final win. \"I think the rest of the players perhaps owe him an apology for the performance because he was terrific and he deserved to have a better team in front of him,\" said West Ham's manager Alan Pardew. \"I think I made myself clear [in the dressing room] about what the standards are at this level, what we expect from them. They can't ever let that happen again.\" Man of the match Lomana LuaLua (Portsmouth)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
