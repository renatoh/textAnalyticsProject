Tell-tale signs include a bottle of Lambrini, an extremely questionable haircut and a scowl so pronounced it could be the by-product of a moderate stroke. In 1978, however, the teenager was a new breed of animal. This surly, monosyllabic human being was a relative mystery to its Spam-eating, postwar parents. This week\u2019s Observer Magazine explores the BO-scented minutiae of what it is to be a teen and how to keep the pesky buggers under control. I\u2019ve condensed the main points as follows: 1. Don\u2019t give them money to do chores; they will not do anything again without bribery. 2. Don\u2019t let boy or girl \u2018friends\u2019 stay the night without parental supervision or they will get pregnant and die. 3. Under no circumstances let them get a motorbike or they will certainly die. 4. If your teenager is considering taking a gap year, secure them a university place without their knowledge \u2013 they will thank you in the long run. 5. If you smell cannabis in their bedroom, call your GP immediately, but do not tell the police \u2013 a criminal record is quite a hindrance. Ah, to be a teen again: the gut-wrenching intensity, the days whiled away on grass verges drinking warm cider and discussing the meaning of life and body hair \u2013 it was hard, wasn\u2019t it? Well, it was even harder in the 70s, guys. My favourite pearls of wisdom, however, are these two genius tips on how to \u2018trick your teenager\u2019 into not drinking: First: \u2018If there isn\u2019t a tidal wave of free drink overwhelming the house, then they are not going to soak in it.\u2019 And secondly: \u2018We encourage them to make a fruit punch. They get just as \u201chigh\u201d in all the dramas, relationships and moods of their music-dominated celebrations.\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
