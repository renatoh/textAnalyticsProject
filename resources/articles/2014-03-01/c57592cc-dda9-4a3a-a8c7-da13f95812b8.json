Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Partial results indicate more than 90% of Crimeans favor secession, according to an election official via RIA Novosti. Crimean officials say turnout was 83%. Revised numbers are expected late tonight. \u2022 Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama spoke by phone, with the White House saying it would \u2018never recognize\u2019 the referendum. The Russian president, however, insisted to his American counterpart that the vote accords to international law, adding that \u201cultra-nationalists and radical groups\u201d threaten Russian \u201ccompatriots\u201d in Ukraine. \u2022 The White House condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cdangerous and destabilizing\u201d actions and called the vote \u201cillegal\u201d, as did the EU and several European nations. The US statement warned Russia that it faces \u201cincreasing costs\u201d. \u2022 Ukraine\u2019s acting PM Arseny Yatseniuk vowed to apprehend separatists \u201dunder the cover of Russian troops\u201d and \u201cbring them to justice\u201d. He said: \u201cthe ground will burn beneath their feet.\u201d \u2022 Russian and Ukraine agreed to a military truce until 21 March, but offered no solution for what happens after the deadline passes. Ukraine announced it would call up a 20,000-large national guard. \u2022 Competing demonstrations continued in eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv, and Ukraine tightened border control. The Obama administration has offered its version of the phone call between US and Russian presidents Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, saying the \u201cCrimean \u2018referendum\u2019, which \u2026 would never be recognized by the United States.\u201d The statement reads, in part: President Obama emphasized that the Crimean \u201creferendum,\u201d which violates the Ukrainian constitution and occurred under duress of Russian military intervention, would never be recognized by the United States and the international community. He emphasized that Russia\u2019s actions were in violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and that, in coordination with our European partners, we are prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions. President Obama \u2026 asked that Russia support the immediate deployment of international monitors to help prevent acts of violence by any groups. President Obama reiterated that a diplomatic resolution cannot be achieved while Russian military forces continue their incursions into Ukrainian territory \u2026 Secretary Kerry continues to be prepared to work together with Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Ukrainian government to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. Scenes from Simferopol: Crimea\u2019s deputy prime minister has told NBC\u2019s Richard Engel that he sees the referendum as \u201cthe first step\u201d. He said \u201cI think the second step will be eastern Ukraine.\u201d Like Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea\u2019s de facto leader, Rustam Temirgaliev is not recognized as legitimate by by Ukraine\u2019s government. Meanwhile, the speaker of the regional parliament expects a swift response from Moscow about its future with the peninsula, Reuters reports. On the Russia 24 television station Vladimir Konstantinov said \u201cI think that [Russia] will answer quickly, because you see what is happening to people, it is an important event, it is not only a Crimean event, it is a Russian and a global event.\u201d British prime minister David Cameron has told the BBC that the UK does not \u201crecognise the Crimea referendum or its outcome. We call on Russia to enter dialogue with Ukraine and resolve this crisis within international law.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker assesses the pro-Russian celebration that\u2019s taken hold of central Simferopol, tweeting that the \u201ccrowd on main square [is] about equally divided between happy families and drunk aggressive blokes\u201d: A Kremlin statement says that \u201cat the initiative of the America side\u201d, Presidents Obama and Putin spoke over the phone, discussing the crisis in Ukraine and Putin stressed the referendum\u2019s legitimacy with international standards. The statement reads, in part: \u201cPutin drew attention to the inability and unwillingness of Kiev\u2019s current authorities to curb outbursts of ultra-nationalists and radical groups, who are destabilizing the situation and terrorizing residents, including the Russian-speaking population and our compatriots. \u201cIn this context there should be considered sending a OSCE monitoring mission to Ukraine. In the view of Russia\u2019s president, this mission should extend to all Ukraine\u2019s regions. \u201cWith regard to the Crimean referendum, Putin stressed that it is fully consistent with the norms of international law and the UN Charter, and in particular, with the famous Kosovo precedent.\u201d \u201cThe heads of state noted that despite having differences in their outlooks, they agreed on the necessary to jointly find a course of action to stabilize the situation in Ukraine. The statement ends by noting that Obama congratulated Putin for the success of the Paralympic Winter Games. Mikhail Malyshev, head of the referendum committee, has said that preliminary results show 95.5% of Crimean voters favor secession to Russia, RIA Novosti reports. After counting half the votes from polling stations, he said the remainder show 3.5% chose more autonomy with Ukraine, and 1% were disqualified and spoiled ballots. (As noted in our explainer on the Crimean referendum, the ballot lacks an option for the status quo \u2013 voters can\u2019t choose to remain a normal region of Ukraine.) Shaun Walker and Harriet Salem have wrapped up the day\u2019s events for the Guardian in Sevastopol and Backhisarai \u2013 telling very different stories. Exit polls said 93% of Crimeans had voted for union with Russia, with a turnout of 83%. Given the absence of recognised election observers, it was impossible to verify how honestly the ballots were counted, but in Sevastopol at least, such figures did not seem implausible. Voter after voter placed into the transparent urns their ballot papers with box No 1 ticked, favouring union with Russia. Of dozens questioned, nobody said they had voted for option two: increased autonomy as part of Ukraine. Gennady Basov, chair of the Sevastopol division of the Russian Block party, said joining Russia would give the city and region \u201cprotection from the neo-Nazis and fascists in Kiev\u201d. In contrast to Sevastopol there were no celebrations, balloons or music in Bakhchisarai, a town with a large Tatar population. \u2026 \u201cI did not vote because what I want is not an option on the ballot paper,\u201d said one Tatar woman who did not want to be named. \u201cI want to be Ukrainian and have rights.\u201d As dusk fell on Sunday, there was no doubt about the result. An hour and a half before the polls closed and the first results were announced, a celebration began on Simferopol\u2019s main square. People waved Russian flags, and from the stage, the Crimean politician Olga Kovitidi sang a pop song backed by a clarinet ensemble, before shrieking into the microphone: \u201cWe have won! Congratulations on the victory! We will be together with Russia!\u201d\ufeff Russia\u2019s largely state-controlled media has kicked into high gear. Television host Dmitri Kiselyov, on state-owned station Russia One, has said that \u201cRussia is the world\u2019s only country ready to turn the US into radioactive ash.\u201d Meanwhile, Kremlin-favored pundit Aleksandr Dugin and the writer Aleksandr Prokhanov are discussing whether anti-war protesters are \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether east Ukraine is already in conflict with the west\u2019s \u201ccynical liberals\u201d. In Ukraine, the quiet of Kiev contrasts with growing celebration in Crimea. The head of the Crimean referendum\u2019s organizing committee, Mikhail Malyshev, has told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the official turnout amounts to 82.71% of voters, or over 1.5 million people. The day progressed from uneventful voting to tense ballot collection and, finally, revelry for supporters of the movement to join Russia. Ukraine has nearly sealed the border with Russia by tightening security and boosting its military presence, the Wall Street Journal reports. Arsen Avakov said earlier today that guards were detaining \u201chundreds\u201d of people with \u201cdubious intentions\u201d along the eastern border, and dashcam footage \u2013 showing Ukrainian military vehicles on the roads east \u2013 seems to corroborate stories of a rapidly mobilizing military. Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea\u2019s de facto leader, has tweeted the announcement that \u201cTomorrow, a Crimean parliament delegation will fly to Russia.\u201d He added that the regional parliament will meet on 17 March to \u201csubmit an official request to join the Russian Federation!\u201d Update: Aksyonov has added: \u201cOn 1 April we will transition to the ruble.\u201d France has joined the chorus condemning Crimea\u2019s referendum, Reuters reports, accusing Russia of exacerbating \u201cpointless and dangerous escalation\u201d. Foreign minister Laurent Fabius also said his country would consider the referendum illegal. The referendum\u2019s turnout, according to a Crimean news agency, closes out at 79% participation across the peninsula; the outlet reports that turnout exceeded 80% in both Simferopol and Sevastopol, and also that there were no complaints. Katherine Haddon of AFP relays that at a \u201cfree, boozy celebration concert\u201d, several thousand people are chanting \u201cSevastopol\u201d and \u201cRussia\u201d. In Simferopol, flags of Russia\u2019s right-wing nationalist party, LDPR, have appeared in the crowds. The White House has released its statement, which condemns the referendum, calls Russia\u2019s actions \u201cdangerous and destabilizing\u201d, and insists that Russia will face \u201cincreasing costs\u201d. It reads, in part: We reject the \u201creferendum\u201d that took place today \u2026 [It] is contrary to Ukraine\u2019s constitution, and the international community will not recognize the results of a poll administered under threats of violence and intimidation from a Russian military intervention that violates international law. Ukraine, the United States, the EU, the OSCE, the UN, and others have called for Russia to allow international monitors \u2026 Russia has spurned those calls \u2026 and instead has escalated its military intervention. Russia\u2019s actions are dangerous and destabilizing. \u2026 Military intervention and violation of international law will bring increasing costs for Russia \u2013 not only due to measures imposed by the United States and our allies but also as a direct result of Russia\u2019s own destabilizing actions. In this century, we are long past the days when the international community will stand quietly by while one country forcibly seizes the territory of another. The first exit polls from the referendum say that about 93% of Crimean voters favor secession, and 7% favor Crimea\u2019s status as part of Ukraine, Russian-owned news agencies are reporting. Interfax is reporting that as of 6pm local time, 75.9% of voters had participated in the referendum, according to the head of the commission organizing the referendum. He told journalists that Sevastopol had 83.5% turnout. Pro-Russian crowds in Donetsk and Kharkiv have seized several buildings and begun burning Ukrainian-language books, Reuters reports. Luke Harding also has more on the volatile situation in eastern Ukrainian cities: There was further turmoil in Donetsk when pro-Russian protesters stormed the prosecutor\u2019s office and removed the Ukrainian flag from the roof raising a Russian flag in its place. Riot police deployed to protect the building made little effort to stop the crowd, which later dispersed. He also has more on the Kremlin\u2019s current stance: The government in Kiev has accused Moscow of deliberately stirring up tensions in the east \u2026 In a series of ominous statements, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has said it may be forced to act to \u201cprotect\u201d ethnic Russians \u2013 an expression that appears to provide a rationale for future military incursions. On Sunday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said he was concerned about the escalation of tensions in the south and south-eastern regions of Ukraine, Reuters reported. He blamed the febrile mood on \u201cradical forces\u201d acting with the \u201cconnivance of the current Kiev authorities\u201d. More on the military truce between Ukraine and Russia, from the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding in Kiev: Russia and Ukraine have agreed a truce in Crimea until 21 March [Ihor Tenukh, acting defence minister] announced. \u2026 The agreement provides some respite for Ukraine\u2019s beleaguered troops, who have been trapped \u2026 since Russian forces began occupying the peninsula on 27 February. Ukrainian soldiers have been encircled ever since, in some cases without electricity. Local residents have smuggled in food to them amid a nervous standoff with the Russian military. But there seems little doubt that Ukrainian forces will be evicted from Kremlin-controlled Crimea once the truce expires on Friday. Crimea\u2019s deputy prime minister, Rustam Temirgaliyev, said on Sunday troops would be given safe passage out. He predicted that eastern Ukraine would be next to join Russia. Kiev has announced it will call up a national guard, Reuters reports. Arsen Avakov, the interior minister, said \u201cAbout 10,000 will be called up in the next 15 days.\u201d He also vehemently argued against the professed identity of protesters and pro-Russian bands in eastern Ukraine, calling them \u201cprofessional touring provocateurs from a neighbouring country\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s head of national security said the military would be working to upgrade as quickly as possible; the government said it planned to arm and train 20,000 for the new guard. Ukraine\u2019s interim leaders, who\u2019ve made a splash by forgoing their predecessors\u2019 limos and jets, have flown economy class to visit the White House and take the subway to work. They\u2019re now taking these tactics a step further: Avakov has advertised how to join the national guard \u2026 on Facebook. Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea\u2019s de facto prime minister \u2013 though not recognized by Kiev\u2019s government as such \u2013 has tweeted that with \u201ctwo hours before the close of polls voter participation was at 73.4%\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian yesterday, Aksyonov said he \u201chad received \u2018signals\u2019 from Moscow that Crimea\u2019s petition would be accepted\u201d. Shaun Walker reported: With the influx of Russian troops and the seizure of power by Aksyonov, who was previously a marginal figure in Crimean politics, many in the west regard events in Crimea as part of a carefully choreographed Russian plan. Aksyonov, however, insisted his rise was a response to a genuine threat from far-right Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev after the events that led to President Viktor Yanukovych being toppled last month. \u201cThe first thing they should have done was to have wide-ranging consultations and invite people from Russian-speaking regions to work together. Instead all we got was threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had no other option. Should we wait here for people to come here with arms?\u201d Demonstrations are carrying on in cities beyond Crimea; the mood seems rather festive for those inclined toward Russia. \u2022 In Crimea, the Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker confirms the bubbly mood among supporters of joining Russia: The EU has issued a statement that aligns with the US stance on Crimea: \u201cillegal and illegitimate and will not be recognised\u201d. The statement, by president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and president of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, goes on to say that a solution is only possible \u201cthrough diplomatic processes\u201d and \u201cin the framework of the Ukrainian constitution as well as the strict adherence to international standards\u201d. They say Russia needs to withdraw its armed forces, and warns that the ministers of foreign affairs will \u201cdecide on additional measures\u201d tomorrow \u2013 a hint that the EU may yet put together sanctions. US secretary of state John Kerry has repeated to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that the US does not recognize today\u2019s referendum as legal, and nor will it accept the outcome, Reuters reports. Kerry told Lavrov that the crisis requires a political solution, that Russia must recall troops back to its bases, and that the US is very concerned about Russian military\u2019s involvement in eastern Ukraine \u2013 namely the Kherson Oblast region in which Ukraine said Russian forces attempted to occupy on Saturday. Reuters\u2019 source, an unnamed US official, says that Kerry \u201curged Russia to back constitutional reform in Ukraine that would protect the rights of minorities such as Crimea\u2019s Russian-speaking population\u201d. \u2022 Crimean authorities report high voter turnout throughout the region, although Tatar and pro-Ukrainian groups pledged to boycott. \u2022 Ukraine\u2019s interim prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk vowed to apprehend separatists \u201dunder the cover of Russian troops\u201d and \u201cbring them to justice\u201d. \u2022 Russian and Ukraine agree to a military truce until 21 March, and Ukraine\u2019s acting defense minister says \u201cno measures will be taken against our military facilities in Crimea during that time\u201d. \u2022 Competing demonstrations continue in eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv, though protests so far are smaller and less violent than in recent days. \u2022 Ukraine appeals for military aid from Nato, but has not yet received a reply. \u2022 The EU reiterates that it will not recognize the referendum\u2019s outcome, as Russian president Vladimir Putin calls German chancellor Angela Merkel to say it \u201ccomplies with international law\u201d. \u2022 No major international organizations are monitoring today\u2019s vote, after \u201cself-defense groups\u201d prevented their entry. A number of self-proclaimed observers, mostly far-right European politicians from across Europe, are in Crimea, with one saying \u201cWhat is sauce for Kosovo\u2019s goose is certainly sauce for Crimea\u2019s gander.\u201d The scene in the main square in Simferopol around four minutes ago. An overview of the Kharkiv demonstration. Some pictures of pro-Russian demonstrations in Kharkiv. Luke Harding tells me that pro-unity rallies took place at the Maidan in the capital Kiev today. Some of those who attended were Crimeans who opposed secession and who said they had left the peninsula in recent days following threats and pressure. Antonina Danchuk, 30, who lived in Simferopol until two years ago, and studied Greek and English at its university, described the referendum as a \u201cfake\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal,\u201d she said. \u201cMy Crimean friends who are there are afraid to go out and build their own Maidan. They\u2019re not voting. People with Russian passports are being allowed to vote.\u201d Danchuk said she wasn\u2019t opposed to Russia as such, but to Putin and his bullying, expansionist policies. \u201cI\u2019m ethnic Russian. But I feel my nationality is Ukrainian. We\u2019ve stayed in Ukraine for 22 years. We want Putin to leave us alone. We don\u2019t want Crimea to be a part of Russia.\u201d Danchuk\u2019s mother Larissa, 62, arrived in Kiev from Crimea\u2019s regional capital Simferopol on Saturday, travelling by train. She said that she had taken part in anti-secession rallies, dressed in the Ukrainian national colours of blue and yellow. She had also brought food to trapped Ukrainian sailors. \u201cWe were protesting outside Simferopol theatre when two cars pulled up. Men with guns got out. They told me: \u201cIf you want to stay alive clear off. Of course I left.\u201d \u201cA similar thing happened two days ago at another demonstration next to the [Taras] Shevchenko statue. A man \u2013 not local \u2013 came up and said: \u201cWhat are you doing? Where are your papers?\u201d Larissa said that she was born in Russia\u2019s Far East, but had lived in Crimea for 37 years. \u201cRussian troops seized the parliament building and hoisted a Russian flag. The whole referendum is taking place at the point of a Kalashnikov. It\u2019s improper, and organised by Moscow.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t know how long she would be stay out of Crimea, but said she wanted to return for her grandson\u2019s impending birthday. Danchuck, her husband Taras, and their one-year-old son Lyubomyr had driven to the Maidan in a black saloon car decorated with anti-Putin slogans. One read: \u201cCrimea=Ukraine\u201d. Another described the Russian leader as an \u201cexecutioner\u201d. Lyubomyr sat placidly in his pushchair, wearing a romper suit and a yellow and blue scarf, above a sign which read: \u201cPutin is a poo\u201d. Just been listening to Polish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski on CNN There is a patchwork of nationalities in the east of Europe and the west. We find ways of resolving these issues and pretty much we rub along. This is the way it has worked until now. Not a Russian or a Russian speaker has been harmed in Crimea or east Ukraine so there is not even a pretext for what is going on. One outcome of the Putin-Merkel telephone call is that there will be an increase in the number of monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. These monitors were not allowed to pass pro-Russian checkpoints in Crimea but Putin wants them to monitor anti-Russian violence in the east of Ukraine. Steffen Seibert, Merkel\u2019s spokesman said: The chancellor proposed swiftly expanding the existing OSCE presence in Ukraine and sending a bigger number of observers into hot spots, especially in East Ukraine. I have just noticed this tweet about the social media identification of a pro-Russian protester in Donetsk as a protester in Riga in 2009. President Putin has telephoned Chancellor Merkel to tell her that the Crimean referendum complies with international law. Crimean authorities report a large turnout in its referendum on joining Russia. Tatar leader urges his people to boycott the vote. Ukrainian leaders vow to defend their territory and track down separatists. Russians and Ukrainians agree military truce until March 21. Ukraine\u2019s appeal for military aid from Nato has not received a reply. Reuters report the prime minister\u2019s words in more detail. Ukrainian prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk vowed on Sunday to track down and bring to justice all those promoting separatism in its Russian-controlled region of Crimea \u201cunder the cover of Russian troops\u201d. \u201cI want to say above all ... to the Ukrainian people: Let there be no doubt, the Ukrainian state will find all those ringleaders of separatism and division who now, under the cover of Russian troops, are trying to destroy Ukrainian independence,\u201d he told a cabinet meeting as the region voted in a referendum on becoming a part of Russia. \u201cWe will find all of them - if it takes one year, two years - and bring them to justice and try them in Ukrainian and international courts. The ground will burn beneath their feet.\u201d Some aggressive talk from Kiev as Arseniy Yatseniuk, the prime minister, says the government will track down and bring separatist ringleaders to justice. Ukrainian journalists have exposed some of the shortcomings of the referendum organisation. BBC Monitoring has translated some reports from Unian news agency about Russian activities near Ukrainian troops and sailors. Russian security forces have also been throwing grenades into the water next to Ukrainian navy ships in Sevastopol\u2019s Kuryna Bay. Russian troops have placed several dozen anti-tank mines outside a base of Ukrainian marines in the Crimean town of Feodosiya. Ihor Tenyukh, the Ukrainian defence minister told reporters in Kiev that the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministries have agreed a truce in Crimea until March 21. Ukrainian troops will stay in their bases and Russians who are often stationed outside the bases will not attempt to remove them. What happens after March 21 has yet to be negotiated. Alec Luhn in Moscow says that local media are reporting that Ukrainian military units are heading toward the Russian border while pro-Russians are doing what they can to stop them. Around 300 men in Lugansk put up barricades of scrap metal to prevent military vehicles from Kiev proceeding further east and that residents near Donetsk also stopped a military convoy from passing. In Kiev, Luke Harding has been talking to British expat Dave Young who is very critical of Britain\u2019s response to Russia\u2018s actions in Crimea. Young was at a pro-Ukraine rally today at the Maidan in Kiev, holding a Union flag with the words \u201cGreat Britain- Ukraine\u201d written on it. Demonstrators carrying flags from around the world were protesting against today\u2019s \u201creferendum\u201d in Crimea. It\u2019s been limp and apathetic. He\u2019s been slow to react, more concerned with protecting the interests of the City than doing what is right. It feels that Britain has a corporate foreign policy where the aim is to offend no-one. There is a fundamental argument here about the right of a country to decide its future. It\u2019s being sabotaged from outside. God knows how long Russia has been planing this action. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want Ukraine to stand as an independent nation. The whole of Europe needs to realise this is a pivotal point. After here, where next? If this state falls what next? The Ukrainian foreign ministry has accused Russia of vetoeing the UN charter and threatening peace and security in a statement issued today. Russia has factually disregarded the fundamental principles and goals of the Charter of the United Nations. The draft is based on the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State, as well as on the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes (Article 2 of the UN Charter) and non-recognition of an acquisition of territory as a result of threat or use of force, and others. In other words, \u201cRussia has vetoed the UN Charter itself\u201d, as it was rightly pointed out by the Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations......... .....The illegitimacy of the so-called referendum in Crimea scheduled for 16 March 2014, as well as the fact that its results cannot lay grounds to any changes in the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, have also been recognized internationally, as this step contradicts not only the Constitution of Ukraine but the international law as a whole. All the above confirms that today\u2019s Russian leadership has taken up principal responsibility for undermining the fundamental principles of international law and transformed Russia into a personification of threats to international peace and security in the 21st century. First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Yarema said that Ukraine had appealed for US and European military assistance in the event of border clashes with Russia and also to guard the airspace above Ukraine\u2019s 15 nuclear reactors. But Ukraine have received no clear response. \u201cNo clear reply was received,\u201d he said in a television interview. \u201cBoth the Americans and the Europeans will decide in terms of the situation.\u201d Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk met U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington last week but no mention was made of U.S. military assistance. Ukraine will not pull its troops out of Crimea despite a rapid build-up of Russian troops in the region to a level of about 22,000 servicemen, according to the defence minister. Ihor Tenyukh said Ukraine did not consider the peninsula lost and would remain there and take action in accordance with events, Reuters reports. Under agreements covering the basing of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet in Crimea, Russia had set a limit of 12,500 for the number of its servicemen in Crimea for 2014, he said. \u201cUnfortunately, in a very short period of time, this 12,500 has grown to 22,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a crude violation of the bilateral agreements and is proof that Russia has unlawfully brought its troops onto the territory of Crimea.\u201d He saod the figure of Russian servicemen in Crimea had stood at 18,400 on Friday. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in the number of Russian servicemen in Crimea. And the Ukrainian armed forces are therefore taking appropriate measures along the southern borders.\u201d Tenyukh said every senior Ukrainian officer in Crimea \u201cclearly knows what is to be done depending on the situation. Decisions will be taken depending on how events unfold. But let me say once again that this is our land and we will not be leaving it.\u201d BBC Monitoring reports that the leader of the Crimean Tatar ethnic minority, Refat Chubarov, has criticised today\u2019s referendum, calling it a \u201cclown show\u201d and a \u201ccircus\u201d. In an interview with Kiev-based Inter TV, he urged Crimean Tatars to boycott the vote. This is from a correspondent from Janes but I think he means Russian armour as Artemovsk is in Russia. I stand corrected. There is also an Artemovsk in Ukraine After the cyber attacks on Nato the Crimean referendum site has been hacked. Amnesty International has expressed concern for the welfare of three activists in the Crimean capital Simferopol in Ukraine who have disappeared after apparently being chased by unknown vehicles and having shots fired at them late on Thursday night. Two of the activists\u2019 mobile phones have been traced to the vicinity of Simferopol\u2019s military commissariat, which is being guarded by military officers in unmarked uniforms, though the officers deny that they are holding them. The three activists - Oleksiy Gritsenko, Natalya Lukyanchenko and Sergiy Suprun - have been in the region since last week. Today the father of Gritsenko confirmed to Amnesty that there has been no contact with any of the three since 11pm last night, following a call from Lukyanchenko to fellow activists to say that their car was being chased by vehicles and shots had been fired at them. The International Federation for Human Rights has issued a press release condemning the referndum in Crimea. According to the release, \u201cSince the announcement of the \u201creferendum\u201d, the self-proclaimed Crimean authorities, supported by the deployment on the territory of increasing numbers of Russian military forces, have carried out abductions and expulsions towards continental Ukraine pro-unity activists, acts of intimidation of local communities, and the closing down of all independent media, thereby violating Ukrainian and international Human Rights legislation. Given the lack of security, many persons are presently fleeing from Crimean territory. The self-proclaimed authorities have also prevented the deployment of international observers. The OSCE observation mission has several times been refused access to the territory. Ivan Simonovic, UN Assistant Secretary general for Human Rights, was prevented from visiting Crimea, supposedly for \u201csecurity\u201d reasons. And Robert Serry, UN special envoy to Crimea, was expelled on 5 March. \u201c Karim Lahidji, the president of FIDH said: The legal and security conditions, and the conditions relating to freedom of expression and opinion, are such that the referendum cannot be held without violating international law, thereby losing its legitimacy, validity and legal value. The security council, of which all the members except Russia recalled the principles of territorial sovereignty, must act, by virtue of the founding principles of the United Nations Charter, in order to preserve regional security and the fate of its populations. Russian bikers take a trip to Crimea. Kiev Post tweets that 30% of registered voters cast their votes within 30 minutes of polls opening in Crimea but then corrects itself. There are a few suggestions pro-Russians are organising a much bigger demomonstration in Donetsk today. Both demonstrators and police are bussing in re-inforcements. The tone gets nastier as it praises Putin for \u201cfighting the criminal Jewish oligarchs\u201d. Russia is fighting her way out of the corruption and problems left behind from the collapse of the Soviet system and the treachery of Gorbachev. Putin has been fighting the criminal Jewish oligarchs and slowly dismantling their corruption and hold on power; but this is not an over-night fix. It is a slow fight and one that Putin is winning, against much pressure from the West and within. Ukraine need(s) to understand that the offer of assistance from Russia, without the austerity package that goes with the EU Europe loan, was really the best deal for Ukraine. Russian sentiment for the Ukraine is fraternal - the EU\u2019s sentiment for the Ukraine simply commercial. Whoring is quite a theme on the opinion pages of Pravda. In separate piece, it castigates Ukraine: So determined to rid themselves of the corruption of a democratically elected President, they can\u2019t wait to whore themselves to the EU pimp who plies Euros in exchange for souls. They are convinced that somehow the West is going to offer a solution to their perceived hardship and corruption that they have suffered. Corruption that has been unleashed by the West on the former Soviet Union through the dismantling of the Soviet System and the ensuing vacuum that allowed the cartels to flourish and take power. The corruption will continue even after the illegitimate government is installed; it will just be more insidious, pervasive and suffocating and this time - impossible to escape from. The English website of Pravda carries a fairly inflammatory coloumn in which it describes Angela Merkel as the whore of Washington. Washington, enabled by its compliant but stupid NATO puppets, is pushing the Ukrainian situation closer to war. German Chancellor Merkel has failed her country, Europe, and world peace. Germany is the strength of the EU and NATO. Had Merkel said \u201cNo\u201d to sanctions on Russia, that would have been the end of the crisis that Washington is brewing, a crisis unlikely to be ended short of war. But Merkel has signed away the sovereignty of the German nation and assigned the fate of Germany to a province in the American Empire. Thus has Merkel and the weak German leadership consigned the world to war. Already blamed for World War 1 and World War 2, now Germany will be blamed for World War 3. Stephen from Yalta emailed the BBC and described the economic problems facing Crimeans as they vote. My wife is Crimean Russian, and will be voting in favour of re-joining Russia. There has been a massive run on ATM\u2019S and banks yesterday. Queues up to 10 metres long. The local money changers are cashing in on this. Buying and selling USA Dollars at a extortionate rates. AFP has been talking to voters in Sevastopol. One voter, Aleftina Klimova, 80, said she was born in Russia and wanted to re-join it. \u201cI was expecting that the United States, France and all of them would act in a negative way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see, I was afraid for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I wondered what he would do to resist... But he managed to resist. I have not slept all night, I waited for this moment and everything is going as I wanted.\u201d A second voter, 57-year-old Tatiana Ischinka, added: \u201cWe want to go home. It\u2019s our land, our town, our country, our republic. We all want it, all of Sevastopol. It\u2019s a Russian-Slavic town.\u201d Alec Luhn in Moscow says that Russian state television is reporting a huge turnout for Crimean referendum and \u201cno armed men\u201d at the polling stations. \ufeffState news agency Interfax is quoting observer Enrique Ravello, a well-known nationalist deputy in Spain\u2019s parliament, as saying he\u2019s seen an \u201cunprecedented turnout\u201d in Crimea. \u201cThere\u2019s no coercion, pressure on people. The referendum is being held peacefully, freely and openly.\u201d According to polling by German research group GfK, 70% of Crimeans who want to participate in the referendum plan to vote to join Russia, while only 11% plan to vote to remain part of Ukraine. The Crimean referendum website was down on Sunday. Previously, organisers said the site underwent a DDoS hacker attack originating in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne in the United States. St. Petersburg has closed down its main street for an automobile rally in support of the Crimean referendum organized by conservative parties. Yesterday, Moscow saw huge competing rallies for and against Russian intervention in Ukraine. At least 10,000 people took part in an anti-intervention, anti-Putin rally, at the end of which was read a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Crimea and the end of Russian interference in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs. Russia Today writes that a group calling itself CyberBerkut has claimed responsibility for taking down 3 NATO websites in a series of DDoS attacks. The group criticizes NATO for stirring up turmoil in Ukraine and helping the \u201cKiev junta\u201d suppress freedom of speech. CyberBerkut claims it brought down NATO\u2019s main website (nato.int), as well as the sites of the alliance\u2019s cyber defense center (ccdcoe.org) and NATO\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly (nato-pa.int). The group, in a message posted on its website, says its members will \u201cnot allow the presence of NATO occupation on the territory of our homeland!\u201d The hacktivists also claimed that they are countering the action of the so-called \u201cTallinn cyber center\u201d or NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which has been hired by the \u201cKiev junta\u201d to carry out \u201cpropaganda among the Ukrainian population through the media and social networking.\u201d The Western cyber network, hactivists claim, is hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of the so-called \u201cMaidan Cyber Sotnya\u201d and helps \u201cblocking objective sources of information and concealing criminal activities of those calling themselves the \u2018legitimate authority.\u2019\u201d One tweeter remarks that the banks in Crimea have decided to close on Monday to transfer accounts from Ukrainian hyrvnia to Russian roubles. Here\u2019s a useful info-graphic on the Crimea referendum produced by AFP. Ukraine does not recognize the referendum which is taking place in Crimea Volodymyr Khandogiy, Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to the UK, told the BBC. A referendum, any vote in the situation when you have foreign troops stationed there would not produce any meaningful results. The votes would be casted with the foreign occupation of Crimea. Khandogiy said Ukraine will use all necessary means to defend its territory. Until now soldiers, Ukrainian forces have demonstrated quite remarkable restrain in not being provoked, in not responding to the provocation which is now ongoing in the Crimea. I know for sure that Ukraine will use all necessary means to defend its territory and this is something that must be clear to everyone. He said that he hoped for greater support from the international community. We did get this political support and we are very grateful to everyone both in Security Council and NATO and on the bilateral level. We apreciate the position of the United Kingdom on that matter. But still we would like to see more resolute approach from international community. We would like to see using all sort of measures to stop Russia from interfering into Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs, from occupiing Ukraine, from basically annexing part of Ukraine. Reuters has been speaking to voters in Simferopol. Svetlana Vasilyeva, 27, a veterinary nurse said: I have voted for Russia.This is what we have been waiting for. We are one family and we want to live with our brothers. We want to leave Ukraine because Ukrainians told us that we are people of a lower kind. How can you stay in such a country? A commenter on Twitter has pointed out that the polling booths could actually be covered in the colours of the Crimean flag, which is also red, white and blue, not the Russian flag. Photographs from the polling booths are pouring in. Here are a selection: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov called US secretary of state John Kerry on Saturday to argue that the referendum is compatible with international law. Lavrov issues a statement on Sunday morning. According to Reuters: \ufeffThe call, which the Russian Foreign Ministry said was an extension of the talks Lavrov held with Kerry on Friday in London, was initiated by the U.S. side. \u2018Sergei Viktorovich Lavrov reiterated that the Crimean referendum fully complies with international law and the United Nations Charter and the results should be the starting point in determining the future of the peninsula,\u2019 the ministry said in a statement. \u2018The minister also drew attention to the need for the current Kiev authorities to curb the rampant violence by ultra-nationalist and radical groups terrorising the dissident, Russian-speaking population, our compatriots.\u2019 Neither of the two questions being asked of voters in the Crimea rejects control by Russia, according to a Reuters report: The first question asks: \u2018Are you in favour of the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a part of the Russian Federation?\u2019 The second asks: \u2018Are you in favour of restoring the 1992 Constitution and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?\u2019 At first glance, the second option seems to offer the prospects of the peninsula remaining within Ukraine. But the 1992 national blueprint is far from doing that. Instead, it foresees giving Crimea all the qualities of an independent entity within Ukraine - but with the broad right to determine its own path and choose relations with whom it wants - including with Russia. ITV news Europe editor James Mates has tweeted a picture of a polling booth in Crimea, dressed in the colours of the Russian flag: Voting in the Crimean referendum has begun, to decide if the peninsula will leave Ukraine and become part of Russia. The vote has already been dismissed by president Obama and many European nations, including Ukraine, as illegitimate and in violation of the Ukrainian constitution. The Crimea is predominantly ethnic Russian, and many of its residents say they fear that the new Ukrainian government, who took power after the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych, will oppress them. Since Yanukovych fled to Russia, Crimea has come under control of local militia forces, as well as heavily armed troops under apparent command from Moscow. If the referendum passes, Russia faces the prospect of sanctions from Western nations. Here is a summary of yesterday\u2019s events in the region: Russia vetoed a UN security council motion declaring the Crimea referendum invalid. Thirteen nations voted in favour. Significantly China, which often sides with Russia, abstained Ukraine said it repelled a detachment of Russian troops in southern Ukraine, north of Crimea. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said it was considering protection requests from Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Spurred by the Ukrainian crisis, anti-Putin activists in Moscow staged their largest protest for two years. France said next stage of sanctions against Russia will be on military co-operation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
