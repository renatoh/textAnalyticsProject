Though he's grand and tough enough for that not to matter, he'd be entitled to feel some bewilderment himself. It's not as if Cosmopolis is a departure for him. Its themes - power, technology, violence, terrorism, crowds, the movements and counter-movements of contemporary culture - are those of White Noise, Libra and Mao II. The setting, a contemporary yet futuristic New York, is familiar terrain. Stylistically, too, it's business as usual. So what's the problem? In a word, Underworld, DeLillo's masterwork of six years ago, an alternative history of postwar America and an homage to the ordinary and overlooked. Underworld opened with one of the great set-pieces of modern literature, a New York baseball game that coincides with the beginning of the cold war. It gestured towards something we had not seen before in DeLillo, something generous, populist and, well, not unlike Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, which when it appeared in 2001 was called \"DeLillo Lite\". But DeLillo, when he's being DeLillo, is never easy. And Cosmopolis, which has hard things to say about the direction postmodern society is taking, is an awkward, rebarbative book. \"He speaks in your voice, American,\" runs the first sentence of Underworld , \"and there's a shine in his eye that's halfway hopeful.\" Eric Packer, the main protagonist in Cosmopolis , speaks in a different voice, one you'd never hear on the street. He's a multi-billionaire riding round New York in a stretch limo, and the shine in his eye is otherwordly. We follow him during the course of a long day in April 2000, as he goes looking for a haircut, an ambition which is endlessly frustrated - partly by traffic jams, partly by visitors to his stretch limo (his head of finance, his currency analyst, his doctor, his philosophical adviser, his bodyguard), but mostly by his own wilful deviations. He's a hubristic visionary, a mix of Icarus and Faust. Before the night is out, so DeLillo makes clear almost from the start, he will crack up, burn out and lose everything - not just his wealth but his life. In a world where, as the epigraph from Zbigniew Herbert puts it, a rat has become the unit of currency, Packer is King Rat, a solipsistic trader in futures, master of an amoral universe. \"Rich, famous, brainy, powerful and feared,\" with a casual expertise in ornithology, botany, poetry, astronomy and old English etymology, he has forgotten how ordinary humanity looks and sounds. \"This is good,\" he says to his rich young wife of 22 days when they find themselves having a conversation about pain and sexual jealousy. \"We're like people talking. Isn't this how they talk?\" \"How would I know?\" she replies. The heroes of novels don't have to be likeable, and as the epitome of disengagement, cut off from common pursuits and recognisable feelings, Packer isn't someone we're meant to engage with. A running motif is his contempt for last week's big thing, especially technology. Skyscrapers, airports, phones, walkie-talkies, personal computers, vestibules, automated teller machines, assassination attempts on presidents: he finds them all comically outdated. His own gadgetry, with its flashing monitors and flowing numbers, works in another time-frame, bringing events before they happen and giving them a sharpness they lack in \"real life\". Doubt and ambiguity aren't concepts he understands. He sees himself as the future - and thinks that when he dies the world will end, not him. Packer is less a character than a cypher, a symbol of dystopian triumphalism. If he doesn't seem \"believable\" or \"realistic\", so be it: the words have no meaning in the world he inhabits. The problem for the reader is deciding what authority to accord his observations: do we care what he thinks, given where he's coming from (a 48-room apartment, with lap pool, card parlour, gymnasium, shark tank, screening room, borzoi pen and annexe)? Brett Easton Ellis in American Psycho and Tom Wolfe in Bonfire of the Vanities satirically distanced themselves from their sharkish heroes. DeLillo is more ambivalent. Not that he approves of Packer. But he shares his enthralment with new technologies. And he lets him think bright, dangerous thoughts and speak good lines. The lack of narrative momentum is another difficulty. Dramatic events take place in the street, beyond the windscreen (an anti-capitalist demo, the funeral of a rap artist). A few even take place inside the limo: Packer is given a rectal examination while holding a conversation with a female business associate, which proves orgasmically exciting to them both. There are surreal episodes with rats and a pastry assassin, and the spice of implausible coincidence: four times during his meanderings through the city Packer runs into his wife. Sex happens, death happens, yet nothing moves forward. Even the climactic meeting of Packer and his stalker is preordained, as the stalker clunkily spells out: \"everything in our lives, yours and mine, has brought us to this moment\". Overall, there's a sense of gridlock. Which is apt thematically, but tough on the reader. Perhaps the best way to read Cosmopolis isn't as a novel (not even a \"novel of ideas\") but as a prose-poem about New York - less Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four than Hart Crane's The Bridge. There are brilliant descriptions of passing pedestrians, \"the others of the street, end less, anonymous, twenty-one lives per second ... where a quarter second of a shared glance was a violation\"; of the \"apparitional\" beauty of steam venting through a manhole; of the swell and ache of car-horns, \"a lament so old it sounded aboriginal\"; and of the sound of a gunshot, \"one of the routine ephemera of the night, no different from cats at sex or a backfiring car ... with the dead-ass drift of your personal urban anomie, you can't be expected to react to an isolated bang\". Sentiments such as the last remind us of the values that 21st-century urban anonymity has supplanted - a sense of belonging, or concern for other people. There's a similar moment when Packer finally gets his haircut from a man called Anthony, who goes way back and takes pride in old-style stuff like work, neighbourhood and family. To discover through Anthony that Packer has parents is almost shocking. He likes to pretend he's godlike and self-made, above all lowly kinship. But part of the journey he makes (and there is character development, of a kind) is to recognise the failure of his great dream - \"to live outside the given limits, in a chip, on a disk, as data, in whirl, in radiant spin, a consciousness saved from the void\" - and accept his mortality. Is Cosmopolis a post-September 11 novel? Yes and no. When the planes hit the twin towers 20 months ago, it looked like something from DeLillo, and having got there before it happened he's surely right not to revisit the scene. But the omens are present, both in images of New York highrises - \"the last tall things, made empty, designed to hasten the future\" - and in an aside on American parochialism (the only geopolitics New Yorkers know, it's suggested, they pick up from foreign taxi drivers). More would be indecent. Nothing clamorous is required. DeLillo has always been good at telling us where we're heading. What he describes here is an enslavement to money markets, scrolling screens and virtual realities. The heaviness of the message squeezes the life out his novel. But we ignore him at our peril.
