The corporation's director general said the continued erosion of advertising revenues on commercial television meant introducing advertising to the BBC would be suicide. He told advertisers gathered at the Advertising Assocation's annual lunch: \"There was a time in the late 80s when your campaign had a chance. It's time has gone. The dog is well and truly dead and it is time to bury it. \"If in the commercial world you lose share year after year, in the end you either change your cost base dramaticlaly or fall off the cliff. \"Now, I am resisting the temptation to say I told you so... largely because even I didn't think the downturn in advertising revenue would come this fast. \"But as ITV now faces the challenge of restructuring and cutting some public service elements from its schedule to take account of these market changes, I think my prediction is probably about right.\" He added: \"In a fragmenting market ads on the BBC would only mean even less money for the commercial public service broadcasters.\" Mr Dyke also took the opportunity to tell advertisers they were missing a trick with regard to older viewers. Today is his 55th birthday, the day, he said, when \"the advertising industry has decided I am a non-person\". Mr Dyke said despite his willingness to spend his millions, the industry dismissed his age group \"with a sneer\". \"Despite the fact I am quite rich, buy a new car or two every couple of years, drink a lot of wine and beer and occasionally wander around Tesco on my own I am now, in advertising terms, irrelevant,\" he said. \"In demographic terms I am have joined the group of people that our industry dismisses with a sneer. Today, according to the advertising industry, I have joined the same demographic group as my mother, who is 87.\" Agreeing to speak to an audience of advertisers, agencies and media figures was, Mr Dyke admitted, an odd decision under the circumstances. However, he justified his decision by describing the Advertising Association lunch as the only place where he could surround himself with people older than himself. \"I have long believed in the theory that the way to feel young is to hang around with old people. And looking around today, it's good to see some people I know are older than me and, after the year your industry has had, a lot more who look older than me,\" said Mr Dyke. Niall Fitzgerald, the 56-year-old president of the Advertising Association, replied that he would start a campaign to ensure the demographics used by advertisers were changed to ensure the oldest category began at 65. This would allow media executives to remain relevant to advertisers for a whole decade longer. Perhaps flattering the over-55s would be an effective strategy for the embattled ad industry. A recent survey showed people in this age group were the only viewers to be watching more TV and, therefore, more advertising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
