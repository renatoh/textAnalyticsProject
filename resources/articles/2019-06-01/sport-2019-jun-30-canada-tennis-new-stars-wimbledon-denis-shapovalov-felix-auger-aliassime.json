Almost from nowhere tennis is buzzing on the big screens in the sports bars of major cities and in the hundreds of indoor courts across the country. \u201cWhenever anyone would think of Canada,\u201d says Denis Shapovalov, \u201cit was always, like, it\u2019s a hockey country. But now it\u2019s a tennis country. It\u2019s great for every one of us but it\u2019s great for the country.\u201d This, though, is more than a tennis story. The Canadians who have been making global noise in tennis in recent years all owe something to the country\u2019s welcoming embrace of immigrants \u2013 in contrast to what is happening south of their border. They are an asset not a liability because of an enlightened immigration policy. Milos Raonic\u2019s parents came from Serbia as engineers. Vasek Pospisil\u2019s parents are refugees from Czechoslovakia, via Austria. The parents of Bianca Andreescu, the outrageously gifted 19-year-old, were also engineers, arriving in Canada from Romania. Shapovalov\u2019s parents settled in Vaughan, Ontario, after coming from the former Soviet Union via Israel; F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime is the son of a coach who left Togo to settle with relief and optimism in L\u2019Ancienne-Lorette, a suburb of Quebec City. Raonic and Pospisil have already made their mark in the men\u2019s game while Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are among the leaders of the new wave injecting excitement into a sport that has become mesmerised by the hegemony of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Over the next fortnight at Wimbledon we will see how far their talent takes them. Auger-Aliassime, at 18 years and 10 months, is the youngest player in the men\u2019s draw; he is first to wave the Maple Leaf \u2013 against Pospisil, as it happens \u2013 second up on Court 12 on Monday. They are followed by Raonic against India\u2019s Prajnesh Gunneswaran. The second youngest player in the draw is Shapovalov, at 20 years and two months, and he plays on Tuesday, against the Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis. The internal debate is who will make it first: Auger-Aliassime or Shapovalov? Whoever it is, he will have the support of the other. Shapovalov sounds very much the older brother as he observes, \u201cIt\u2019s always a lot of fun to play with him. There is rivalry, of course, but it\u2019s healthy. The most important thing is we wish the best for each other and we\u2019re really good friends, really close.\u201d During his run to the semi\u2011finals of the Montreal Masters in 2017 Shapovalov slept in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s basement; before he beat Nadal in the third round he ripped the Spaniard\u2019s poster from the wall. There is respect, and there is attitude. These players have both. Auger-Aliassime has earned $1m this year alone, $1.4m since he joined the Tour. Shapovalov is not far behind this season, with $853,277 \u2013 and, longer on the Tour, has career earnings of $3.25m. And consider this: Federer, in his first five matches against top-20 opponents, won only once; in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s first five matches against top-20 players, he did not drop a set, beating Lucas Pouille, 6-4, 6-3, Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-3, Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2, Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6 (4), 6-4, and Borna Coric 7-6 (2), 6-2. Only four players have won three titles before they were 17: Richard Gasquet, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Djokovic \u2013 and Auger-Aliassime. He was the youngest player, at 17, to break into the top 100 since Nadal in 2002. Right now he is not only the youngest player in that group but seeded 21 at Wimbledon and about to scare the living daylights out of some of the seeded stars in his quarter of the draw, including Djokovic, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Daniil Medvedev, Kyle Edmund and Tsitsipas. To listen to him talk about his origins is to hear wisdom beyond his years. \u201cMy father, Sam, came to Canada from Togo when he was 26, with my mum, Marie [from Quebec]. She was a big help for him because he didn\u2019t feel alone and she knew everything about Canada. For sure it was challenging for him. He left everything behind and was sacrificing a lot. The memory I have of growing up is my dad doing everything he could to make it work for us. We never really felt pressure. Everything he did was for the family and the kids.\u201d Sam was also his coach, and led him through the Canadian system from his early teenage years. Shapovalov\u2019s coach was his mother, Tessa \u2013 she still is \u2013 but she took more hands-on control and he learned his tennis almost exclusively from her until he started to rise through the junior ranks. \u201cThe whole story starts with my mum,\u201d Shapovalov says. \u201cShe was playing in the Soviet Union, on the national team. She was pretty good, around 300 to 400 in the world. Then she moved down to Israel with her coach. As soon as I was born, they decided to move to Canada. I was probably about seven months old. \u201cThey moved there with nothing. For months we were sleeping just on a mattress in an apartment. My mum started coaching at a tennis club. My dad worked a couple of jobs; he worked in a factory, doing pastries and stuff. They spoke barely any English back then, so it was very difficult. They speak Russian, Ukrainian and Hebrew. My mum\u2019s part-Jewish and my dad\u2019s Greek Russian Orthodox.\u201d Religion and race count for little in modern Canada. What is resonating there is the chance to forge a new life. For Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov, life could not be much better. As Auger-Aliassime chats to the Guardian about his wonderful life, he has to break off for a scheduled TV interview and is hugely apologetic. But he knows this is the way it is going to be from now on. \u201cBetween matches, practice and rest, you try to fit all these things in. But you get used to it. It\u2019s all about planning. I\u2019m able to be 100% there, for whatever it is I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve got the energy for that.\u201d And he spares a word for his closest tennis friend and rival. \u201cIt has helped both of us having a family structure around. They sacrifice everything for you. They\u2019re not just giving you tennis lessons, they\u2019re giving you life lessons. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for Denis and his mom.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
