After donning the full episcopal regalia on St Patrick's Day, Ryanair's chief pilot was yesterday wielding pistols, dressed in a white wig, black cloak and riding boots. It was a wheeze to draw attention to his airline's decision not to impose fuel surcharges on its fares, compared to the \"skyway robbery\" - geddit - of rivals, particularly BA. Mr O'Leary may have a point, but the boss of one of Europe's biggest carriers should have more confidence in his argument than to feel the need to bolster it by masquerading as a refugee from an amateurish production of Dick Turpin. There's a growing temptation to shoot the messenger - which may mean missing the message. \u00b7 Cricket's banishment to pay-TV has become a bit of a sore point for James Murdoch. The car park outside the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge last weekend was the scene for some sparring between the BSkyB boss and the man who launched test cricket on Channel Four, David Brook. It was sparked by Brook setting up keepcricket.com, in response to Sky winning the exclusive rights. One eyewitness alleges Murdoch told Brook to \"go back to your day job if you have one\". Brook has told friends he has no grudge with Sky, having put Film Four on the platform years ago, but Murdoch clearly doesn't think so. A BSkyB spokesman would not go into all the gruesome details, but confirms a \"gentle sledging\" took place. \u00b7 Selling cheap fags to the financially stretched has been the mainstay of Imperial Tobacco's impressive growth. Its cheap-as-chips Lambert &amp; Butler and Richmond brands take a third of the UK market, while its bargain basement rolling baccy range accounts for half of western Europe. So it should be no surprise that its newest product, unveiled yesterday, is the delightfully named Swedish oral tobacco (a teabag-like pouch which you stick in your gums) Skruf. \"Actually,\" explains an Imps insider, \"it's pronounced 'Skroof'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
