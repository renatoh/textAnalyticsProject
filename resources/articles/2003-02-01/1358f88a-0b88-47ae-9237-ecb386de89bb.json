The party has led a charmed existence under devolution, sharing power with Labour in the coalition executive, able to effect change on core policies such as tuition fees and PR in local government. And while Labour has been hit by falling poll ratings and the SNP has struggled to make headway with voters, the Lib Dems have watched their poll rating steadily increase year on year. It is now expected that they will add several more seats to their current 16 come May, a boost that could take them past the Scottish Conservatives and into position as the third party in Scottish politics. Much of the party's success can be laid at the feet of the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, a former QC who has become one of Holyrood's most able and trusted parliamentarians. Called upon to take up the mantle of first minister when Donald Dewar died and Henry McLeish resigned in disgrace, Wallace turned in a commanding performance, demolishing the SNP and the Tories in the chamber and calming nerves at a time of deep uncertainty. But there has been a price to pay, and the party has been accused of selling out to keep their coveted position in the executive. Late last year, the Lib Dems announced they were entering the elections as rivals to Labour. But a leaked document detailing joint policy proposals for the next few years revealed they intended to stay in their marriage of convenience if the voters allowed. And earlier this month they voted against an SNP-sponsored private members bill to introduce PR in local government. PR has long been the holy grail policy for the party, and they struggled to explain their rejection of the SNP proposal. Separate legislation to adopt the single transferable vote system of PR in place of first past the post was unveiled by the executive recently, but Labour have made it clear the bill will not be heard until after the elections. It is widely believed that if Labour can secure an overall majority the bill will be quickly dropped. But the Lib Dems have shown that they are willing to abandon their Labour partners on some issues. In the Holyrood debate on war in Iraq, Lib Dem MSPs demanded a second UN resolution, voting against an obscure Labour motion which simply recognised Westminster's authority in matters diplomatic and military. Afterwards, Jim Wallace insisted the party's refusal to support Labour would not hurt the coalition. The issue of war was too important to put politics before principle, he said. It is such commitment that has endeared the party to voters. But coalition means compromise and Holyrood's second term could require even greater give and take."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
