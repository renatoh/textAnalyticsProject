The champions scored twice in 90 first-half seconds to seal victory at Crystal Palace, with Gabriel Jesus recording his 50th goal for the club. The 22-year-old has scored in all three league matches he has started this season, yet Guardiola singled out the striker \u2013 who was preferred to Sergio Ag\u00fcero after impressing City\u2019s manager in two matches for Brazil during the international break \u2013 for failing to convert a series of chances in the second half. In particular, Guardiola referred to an opportunity in the dying stages when Jesus opted to shoot rather than set up an easy chance for Kevin De Bruyne and insisted that could have come back to haunt City had it not been for earlier saves from Ederson to deny Christian Benteke and Wilfried Zaha. \u201cThe last action \u2026 like when he has to pass to Kevin, he has to do it,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cBut he is so young. We missed a lot of chances and also lost a lot of chances in the box. We have to be clinical. \u201cThe people say about the Champions League, that target. We still are not ready. We create a lot, don\u2019t concede, but can improve. We\u2019ve scored a lot over the last two seasons and I don\u2019t have doubts about that, but we have to keep going, work on that.\u201d Given City have racked up 29 goals from nine Premier League matches to follow the 95 and 106 they amassed in the previous title-winning seasons, Guardiola\u2019s claim is bizarre. It should perhaps be taken more as a challenge to Jesus, who expressed frustration at his lack of opportunities in September having made only eight league starts in 2018-19. Ag\u00fcero was involved in a minor car crash on Wednesday on his way to training but Guardiola explained that Jesus had been preferred after performing well for his country. \u201cHe fights with Sergio and Sergio fights with him for one position,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Sometimes I need Sergio for many things and sometimes I need Gabriel. Of course there is more to come. For him and for everyone. I can\u2019t play any more because I\u2019m not the age to play, but he can play \u2013 it\u2019ll be a long career. His mentality means he\u2019ll always have success. He is hungry, he wants to become an important striker around the world. We are lucky to have him.\u201d The selection of Rodri to partner Fernandinho in central defence raised eyebrows, although Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi is expected to be fit for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League home game against Atalanta after returning from international duty with a back injury. Guardiola said he had been impressed with how the converted holding midfielders had adapted and praised the full-backs Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Benjamin Mendy for their contribution to City\u2019s new-look back four. \u201cIt\u2019s an option \u2013 Rodri can play there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we decide to do it we\u2019ll have more midfield players on the pitch and we did it. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen in the future but he convinced me as an alternative. Jo\u00e3o had his first game away in the Premier League; it\u2019s not the same as the Etihad. He was aggressive and has incredible quality with the ball. Benjamin as well. He was injured long term and hopefully he can stay because he has a special quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
