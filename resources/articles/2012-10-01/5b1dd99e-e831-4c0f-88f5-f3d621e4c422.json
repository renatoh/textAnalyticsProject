He told them that he is open to the idea of statutory underpinning for effective regulation of the press. Charlotte Church, the singer who was a victim of phone hacking and was part of a delegation of the campaign, revealed the conversation at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on Tuesday. There have been rumours that Cameron is preparing to reject statutory intervention in the regulation of the press even if it is strongly recommended by Lord Justice Leveson when he reports next month. Church said after meeting Cameron that she had \"faith\" he would accept the recommendations from the Leveson report, with a new system of regulation \"which we the public can trust and is not controlled by the editors. I found that very comforting,\" she said. The Hacked Off campaign is in favour of an independent system of regulation, with a minimum statutory underpinning to ensure the standards of the regulator set up do not slip and that all newspaper editors are signed up to the new code. Church said Cameron seemed open to the idea of a statutory backstop: \"The prime minister seemed open to the idea of statutory underpinning but was very opposed to the idea of having massive amounts of statutory legislation for everybody to follow \u2026 which is not what Hacked Off want either. \"We are absolutely advocates of free speech and want freedom of expression to continue but they just need to be watched because it has gone out of control over a long period of time. But it's important to say the prime minister was open-minded about statutory underpinning. It's not about us being excessive.\" If Cameron subsequently rejected the demands of the campaign, it would leave the victims \"unbelievably disappointed\", she said. Church, who said her own story \"paled\" next to those recounted by ordinary people, warned: \"It would be doing the biggest injustice to them after this long inquiry, which public money has gone into. \"We have established wrongdoing, that there needs to some changes made, and we just went in there to make sure \u2026 that it wasn't all in vain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
