Seven weeks of the sort of phoney war that had warnings being roared out, predictions made (usually \"five nil unless it rains\" from the Aussies, ha ha), captains \"targeted\", Warney having a new mystery delivery ( always imaginary but still picked by Richie Benaud) and interviews scoured microscopically for anything that might be tickled up into a row. There should be a media version of the Ashes, which if awarded for monocular trumpet-blowing would go to Australia more often than not, but to England for the capacity to get the ball into the ribs on even the most placid of press pitches. With Shane Warne in the commentary box, now options had already been reduced substantially. Hope rested on one particularly soft target. But the omission of Andrew Symonds, the equivalent of a juicy long half-volley for the pack here, is a masterstroke of selection. Andrew Hilditch has come up with a squad of impeccable length and line, which will require us hacks to raise our game to new levels. There has, of course, been much for Australians to tootle on the horn about this past decade or so. Their dominance of international cricket has been as complete as was that of West Indies before them, a superiority as overwhelming as, say, that of Tiger Woods, in which they took play to an altogether higher level. It took something special to beat Australia, which India managed remarkably, as did England four years ago. As well as England played that summer (out of their socks), even that Australian loss carried with it the air of a side that had actually lost focus, with a coach intent on trying to produce better people, and ignoring the basics that apply even for the very best. The spine was simply awe-inspiring: Hayden, Ponting, Gilchrist, Warne, McGrath. Scary. That has all gone, though. Times move on. It has taken England a while to absorb the message that you cannot live on past glories, and it is a process that Australia similarly appear to be going through. Victories \u2013 let alone 16 on the bounce, which is supernatural \u2013 no longer come as a right any more than the expenses of British members of Parliament. This recent Australian team emerged from series losses in India and at home to South Africa to win in the return series against the Proteas. They do not dominate Test matches as once they did. Instead they have relearned the art of scrapping, standing toe-to-toe and slugging it out. Ponting's team looks to be a good one but it carries no aura. Be honest about it for a second: cut away the hype and there is little physical or technical beyond the normal with which England, on their game, should not be able to cope. Which leaves the mind games. Steve Waugh's \"mental disintegration\" was part of his process, if not to everyone's taste, but there were exceptional players to back it up. This team will be feisty \u2013 that is their nature \u2013 but they will have to tread more warily. The batting seems as if it can look after itself for the most part. Eyes will be on Phillip Hughes, not least to see whether his idiosyncratic method will stand scrutiny now he has been seen a bit more. Clearly he is a special talent, but top bowlers have a way of exploiting unorthodoxy. His recent hundreds in the County Championship Second Division should not be discounted but kept in perspective: Strauss, for example, outscored him heavily in the only match they played together, during which they both made hundreds. But is Ponting quite the invincible player he once was? Is Michael Hussey for that matter? What of the attack? Mitchell Johnson has emerged as one of the most improved pacemen in the game, the addition of a ball swinging at pace into the pads of right-handers a devastating weapon. Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus have much to live up to, however, not least the technical problem of adjusting to the length required in England (and Wales). Brett Lee has rarely been a threat in this country and Stuart Clark, a fine controlling bowler but no Glenn McGrath, could well be relegated to back-up. It looks good but not great. The lack of a quality spinner is the most stark feature of the side. There has been no legacy from the careers of Warne, Stuart MacGill or Brad Hogg. Desperation brought in Bryce McGain for a Test in South Africa and it proved an embarrassment. If pitches turn, as well they might at some stage, then it will be Nathan Hauritz or part-timers. However much he couches that in positive terms, that will be a concern for Ponting. The longer games last, the more it suits England. A rule of thumb here would be to regard Australia as not as accomplished as they say they are and to view England as better than people would like to think. Australia came back well to beat South Africa, but after their aberration in Jamaica, England have played excellent cricket that would have tested better sides than West Indies. They have grown immensely over the past six months. Both will bat deep (unless England play two spinners, I cannot see them with more than three seamers and Graeme Swann, which could mean Andrew Flintoff at eight and Stuart Broad at nine). Neither tail will collapse easily. This will be closely fought. They could play each other into oblivion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
