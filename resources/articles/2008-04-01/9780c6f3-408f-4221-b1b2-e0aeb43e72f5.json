Torrential downpours quickly turn tame picture-postcard cascades into raging torrents, and the ever-popular falls at Ingleton didn't disappoint. Along the wooded ravine, the sound of rushing water grew steadily louder until we reached Pecca falls, where the exhilarating, concussive force of the raging white water of the river Twiss, tumbling over ledges and squeezing between rock walls, was enough to dispel any gloom that the weather could deliver. In an atmosphere kept perpetually moist by clouds of spray, conditions were perfect for feathery mosses and scaly liverworts that smothered steep banks where the first spring flowers - golden saxifrage and barren strawberry - were beginning to open. Upstream the river delivered its tour de force - Thornton Force - a 14-metre-high curtain of water at the head of the valley. And then we reached the open treeless landscape of broken limestone scars and dry-stone walls, filled with the bubbling calls of curlews, leaving the sound and fury of falling water behind. We crossed the river above the Force and followed the footpath that skirts Twistleton Scar End, with the great bulk of Ingleborough looming in the haze away to the south-east. Suddenly we found ourselves surrounded by \"chak, chak\" alarm calls that seemed to come from every direction. We had arrived on this bleak, stony hillside at the same moment as a fall of wheatears, newly arrived at the end of their long migration. Immaculately plumaged in slate-grey backs, black eye stripes and pale orange bibs, they perched on barbed wire, foraged on the grassy slopes and flitted along the wall tops just a few yards ahead of us. The limestone hills of Yorkshire on a wet and windy April morning were a stark contrast to their tropical African wintering grounds, but their arrival was a welcome affirmation that spring had arrived."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
