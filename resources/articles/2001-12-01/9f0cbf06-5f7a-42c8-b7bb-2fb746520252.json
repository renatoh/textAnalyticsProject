For 41 minutes they were so poor it was impossible to imagine them scoring. By the finish they had torn Bolton apart. Claudio Ranieri will need more convincing that the club have overcome their disease of falling to the minnows after hammering the big boys. But at the end of this emphatic win, which followed the 4-0 victory here over Liverpool, he could afford a smile. \"The first 35 minutes was very shit, unbelievable,\" the coach confessed, speaking English the fans will understand. Having gone behind inside four minutes, Chelsea were at their disjointed worst and Bolton looked comfortable. Two goals in quick succession before half-time and a third by Boudewijn Zenden after 56 minutes changed everything. Bolton, in the words of their manager Sam Allardyce, \"went under\" and they are sinking fast. For Chelsea nine goals in two matches and their first back-to-back league wins merely guarantee them a merry Christmas. The outcome of the next two games, at Arsenal and Newcastle, will determine whether it runs into a happy new year. Those results will also indicate whether Chelsea can challenge for the title, a prize Ranieri says is beyond his reach but which his players must believe they can attain. Two goals have been conceded in nine matches, with William Gallas displaying an impressive assurance, though Carlo Cudicini needed to make two good saves. Bolton have taken only one point from four matches, yet there was nothing wrong with the way they started. Kevin Nolan headed in Per Frandsen's cross and they might have had two more before half- time. The tactic of pulling bodies behind the ball was frustrating Chelsea, with Paul Warhurst impressing in front of the back four. Suddenly, though, the game turned. Chelsea, having struggled with their passing and created nothing, got two goals from long balls. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink ran on to Zenden's pass, held off Mike Whitlow and set up Eidur Gudjohnsen to score against his former club with a fine low shot. Then Gudjohnsen's skill and neat pass allowed Hasselbaink the second. \"Forty-one minutes of doing the job properly and then four minutes of madness,\" Allardyce said. Af ter Ranieri had berated his players - \"The warm-up is over, please play football\" - worse followed for Bolton. Zenden was able to ride Warhurst's challenge but emerged to lob Jussi Jaaskelainen and, uncharacteristically, the visitors lost their passion. Cudicini made a save before Colin Hendry turned Hasselbaink's cross into his own net and Frank Lampard scored his first Premiership goal for Chelsea from the edge of the box to complete a strange afternoon. Despite managing only four efforts of their own on target, Ranieri's team had scored five times. Then again little is ever straightforward with Chelsea.
