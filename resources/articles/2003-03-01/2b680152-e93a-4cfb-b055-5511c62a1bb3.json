Three more, so far unidentified, delegations have also been the victims of wire-tapping. The discovery comes two weeks after the Observer revealed that the US had been bugging security council members Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria, Guinea and Pakistan. The bugging devices were found in the Brussels offices used by Tony Blair and his ministers - rooms which will be used again by the prime minister when he attends an EU summit tomorrow. Yesterday the offices in the council of ministers building were occupied by Foreign Office delegates and the Europe minister, Denis MacShane, during a meeting of EU foreign ministers - although the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, was not there because of the Commons debate on Iraq. Similar bugs were also found in French and German delegation offices in the same building in the EU quarter of Brussels - and this afternoon EU officials said three other unnamed national delegation rooms had been targeted. A British government spokesman in Brussels said: \"It appears the bugs were found during a routine inspection of the phones. An investigation has been launched by officials from the council of ministers, and we await the outcome, which could take some time. \"We have offered UK expertise in the inquiry if it will help, because obviously we are very concerned, and very interested to get to the bottom of this.\" So far Belgian police have not been called in, according to EU officials, but they are likely to be involved if a serious security breach is uncovered. The council of ministers building houses a large staff overseeing the progress of EU commission policy initiatives through national government delegations. Almost every week, national ministers from all government departments - from environment and transport to foreign affairs and agriculture - meet in the building to take decisions on proposed legislation. Most of their private talks would concern negotiating tactics on EU policy - but even that could provide valuable leverage to an eavesdropper. Few sensitive telephone contacts would be made from the delegation office, one insider said this afternoon: the UK government's own \"embassy\" to the EU is just across the road, where ministers would use secure phone lines, if required, during visits to Brussels. The vast, pink marble and granite council of ministers building was opened in the mid-90s and telephone sweeps have been conducted regularly since then. But security is bound to be stepped up now - even beyond the high levels already in place and constantly under review since the terrorist attacks in America in September 2001. Tomorrow, Mr Blair is due to fly in for a meeting to assess the post-war situation in Iraq, and stay on for long-scheduled economic talks on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
