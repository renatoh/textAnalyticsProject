Dr Alfa Saadu, 68, was volunteering at the Queen\u2019s Victoria memorial hospital, in Welwyn, Hertfordshire \u2013 one of the counties worst hit by the virus \u2013 when he became ill. His son Dani confirmed that his father had died after a two-week battle with the disease. Dr Saadu had not specifically answered the call for retired doctors to return to the front line to tackle the pandemic. But his death will raise more questions about the wisdom of the government\u2019s drive to encourage former medics back to work when older people are more at risk from coronavirus. Dr Saadu had retired from the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow in 2016 after a distinguished 40-year medical career, but was helping out behind the scenes at his local hospital in Welwyn. It was announced on Sunday that Amged el-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant from Burton hospital in Derbyshire, had died. A 63-year-old surgeon, Adil el Tayar, also died last week after volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands to help the NHS cope with the pandemic. GP Dr Habib Zaidi, 76, also died last week after showing \u201ctextbook symptoms\u201d of the virus. Dani said his father was \u201ca very passionate man, who cared about saving people. \u201cAs soon as you spoke to him about medicine his face would light up,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people\u2019s lives here and in Africa. Up until he got sick, he was still working part-time saving people.\u201d He added: \u201cHe was a massive family man and we did everything together. Family came first. He left two sons and a wife, who is a retired doctor herself in occupational health.\u201d Lance McCarthy, chief executive of Princess Alexandra Hospital, said Dr Saadu would be \u201cremembered fondly by many\u201d. He added: \u201cAlfa was well-known at the trust for his passion for ensuring our patients received high quality care.\u201d The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among the many who paid tribute to Dr Saadu\u2019s heroism. Abbas Mirza, a former colleague, said Dr Saadu\u2019s death underlined the continued sacrifice NHS workers were making to save lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
