Attenborough, 88, whose on and off screen broadcasting career spans more than 60 years, said subjects including music and natural history were no longer regularly covered in a serious way. In a Radio Times interview to promote his latest BBC1 natural history series, Life Story, he said most documentaries were now usually two or three episodes in length at the most, which was not enough to \u201cdeal with something properly\u201d. Attenborough compared this to Civilisation, which he commissioned as BBC2 controller and which was broadcast in 1969, and the first major natural history series he presented, Life on Earth, which both stretched to 13 weekly episodes. \u201cThese days it\u2019s a three-parter if you\u2019re lucky, or it\u2019s a two-part series. I would like a stronger commitment and a belief in your subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to stick with us, stick with us for three months, and at the end of it you\u2019ll have learnt something. There was The Great War on BBC2 \u2013 that was a 26-part series. Come to that, The Forsyte Saga was a 26-part series too.\u201d Attenborough said he was looking forward to the BBC\u2019s updated version of Civilisation, announced by the director general, Tony Hall, this year, but feared that the mood of the audience and TV executives was \u201cagainst the expert\u201d. The original was presented by the art historian Kenneth Clark, who guided viewers through the story of western art, architecture and philosophy since the collapse of the western Roman empire. It is regularly hailed as a critical high point in British factual programme-making. \u201cThe general view is that viewers don\u2019t like people coming along and saying they know more about it than you do, so it\u2019s unfashionable,\u201d Attenborough said. \u201cPeople criticised Kenneth Clark\u2019s mandarin vocabulary in Civilisation \u2013 and it was \u2013 but it was wonderful to listen to. There are people who know more about it than you do, and I like that. I enjoy being told.\u201d With regards his TV viewing, Attenborough said he was mainly a fan of non-fiction, but is not always satisfied by what is on offer. \u201cThere are a great number of subjects that aren\u2019t covered. I mean, music is not covered in any other way than a performance, really. There\u2019s no serious programme about natural history on a regular basis. \u201cI\u2019m a great one for regular programmes that I can make dates with. I like scientific programmes; Horizon is a great series.\u201d He also said he would find it difficult to define the role of BBC2 today. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how they would define its policy. I would be seriously interested to know, in a paragraph, not necessarily a sentence, what guides them, what guides the editorial decisions on BBC2, because it isn\u2019t overly plain to me. \u201cI guess that BBC4 has taken on perhaps the invention and experimental side of BBC2, but it wouldn\u2019t harm them to say so. You know, if they said, \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 But they don\u2019t actually say it.\u201d He also revealed that he did not watch The Great British Bake Off or other cookery shows, or quizzes, saying he was not being snobbish about such programmes \u201cbut I\u2019ve quite a lot to do and I don\u2019t put on the television as a sort of \u2018filler\u2019\u201d. Reflecting more generally on the state of modern TV, Attenborough echoed the sentiment expressed in Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song 57 Channels (And Nothin\u2019 On). \u201cThe sad thing is that you\u2019d think that the more stations there are, the more varied the output, but the practice is the reverse \u2013 the more you get, the more similar they become. And you get genres that become the flavour of the month.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
