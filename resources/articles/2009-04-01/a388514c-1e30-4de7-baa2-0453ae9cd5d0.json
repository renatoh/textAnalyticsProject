The Welsh side have now lost their opening nine league games and are struggling to come to terms with the demands of the top flight. Wigan's 44-10 win would have been even more comprehensive had it not been for five missed conversions. They scored eight tries, with Sean O'Loughlin, Sam Tomkins and Pat Richards all touching down twice. \"Had we kicked our goals it would have been a fair reflection of what we achieved today,\" the Warriors coach, Brian Noble, said. \"There were glimpses that when we look after the ball we can score some tries.\" Despite leading through Luke Dyer's second-minute try, the Crusaders were never a threat and lost Damien Quinn and Marshall Chalk to the sin-bin for acts of petulance in the closing quarter. Their coach John Dixon said: \"We've all got to work a lot harder \u2013 the coach and the players. The key thing is not the getting knocked over, it's the getting up again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
