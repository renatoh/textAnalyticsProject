Simon Mann said Ely Calil, a Lebanese tycoon previously accused of being one of he principal financiers of the coup plot, was the main force behind it in an interview with Channel 4 News from the prison in the capital, Malabo, where he is awaiting trial. \"I was involved and I was the, if you like, manager. Below me were a lot of people \u2013 including those arrested with me in Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"Above me in the machine were other people.\" Calil has denied involvement in the plot. \"I have a great deal of sympathy for Simon Mann's predicament,\" he said in a statement. \"I'm sure he is in considerable distress. He has made many contradictory statements.\" He continued: \"The only statement he has made freely was an affidavit in Zimbabwe in which he confirmed that his original allegations about me were made under duress. That is the only statement of his which is reliable. I can confirm that had no involvement in or responsibility for the alleged coup.\" Channel 4 News said it had seen no evidence to back up Mann's claims. Mann was asked if he had struck a plea bargain with authorities in Equatorial Guinea. He denied he had made a deal but said he was cooperating. \"I have been helping the authorities as best as I can with this sorry story,\" he said. Mann said it was his fault the plot was exposed before his team even entered the country. \"I have to carry the can for that. I was bloody stupid. Mea culpa.\" The former SAS officer was arrested at Harare airport in March 2004 when his plane, en route from South Africa to Equatorial Guinea, landed carrying 67 former soldiers, mainly South Africans, to pick up weapons. They were charged with illegally buying arms and he was sentenced to seven years, in prison, later reduced to four. After completing his term, Mann was released from prison and immediately rearrested because of the extradition warrant from Equatorial Guinea. He was sent to Equatorial Guinea last month in a controversial procedure which saw him moved before an appeal process was completed. Several days later, authorities in Equatorial Guinea said Mann would go on trial for his \"abortive mercenary coup attempt\" to overthrow the country's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Mann was then paraded on state television wearing hand and ankle cuffs and a grey prison jumpsuit. Equatorial Guinea has sentenced 24 other people from European and African nations to lengthy prison terms related to the coup plot. The son of Baroness Thatcher, Sir Mark Thatcher, was also convicted in relation to the plot. He admitted to South African authorities his involvement in hiring a helicopter as part of the conspiracy, and was handed a four-year suspended jail sentence and a 3 million rand (\u00a3200,000) fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
