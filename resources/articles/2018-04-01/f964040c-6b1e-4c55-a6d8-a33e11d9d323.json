The Egypt forward haunted his former club with two exquisite goals, taking his tally for the season to 43, and two assists as Liverpool swept into a 5-0 lead over Roma before conceding two late goals. A 5-2 result means Roma must reprise their remarkable comeback against Barcelona in the quarter-finals to deny Liverpool a place in the Champions League final in Kiev on 26 May. But Klopp, his mood soured by the probable loss of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for the rest of the season through injury, insisted his prolific, devastating team will be ready for a backlash at the Stadio Olimpico next Wednesday. \u201cSince I arrived Liverpool has always had to take the more difficult way but in the end Liverpool always succeeded and that\u2019s what we have to do again,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIf one of my players doesn\u2019t think Roma will try to come back, then he will not play.\u201d The Liverpool manager added: \u201cThe boys played a brilliant game over a very long period. Even the last minutes, when we conceded, Dejan Lovren was outstandingly good and this ball he misjudged \u2013 that is no problem if the full-back is in the right position. We made one mistake and the ref made one mistake and that was two goals for them. We take the penalty. \u201cWe have to work again in Rome, that is no problem. There would have been work to do if we won 5-0 because Roma would do everything to strike back. What I learned tonight is that we can win the second leg too. Roma need to score against us and we are not Barcelona. Barcelona is one of the two or three best teams in the world and won so many things in the last few years. We didn\u2019t so we will fight with all we have for the result.\u201d Salah\u2019s stunning display prompted Steven Gerrard to say of the PFA player of the year: \u201cWithout a shadow of a doubt he is the best player on the planet right now.\u201d Klopp was more circumspect, saying that mantle had to be earned over a longer period than one season but has no doubt of the former Roma player\u2019s credentials. \u201cOutstanding, pretty much not able to defend,\u201d said Klopp, who substituted Salah at 5-0 and saw Liverpool\u2019s performance dip markedly. \u201cThe first 15 minutes we needed to adapt to their formation and then we played how we played and he has a massive impact on that. The first goal is just a genius strike, he scored already a few like this which makes clear it is no coincidence. The second is brilliant play, Bobby Firmino between the lines and he makes the pass and then Mo makes the other two goals. \u201cIf anyone wants to say it is my mistake that we concede the two goals because I change the striker, I have no problem with that. Mo was running all the time and it would not have helped us if he gets an injury. What a player. If you think he is the best in the world, write it or say it. He is in outstandingly good shape, world-class shape, but to be the best in the world you need to do it over a longer period, I think. The other two are not bad.\u201d Eusebio Di Francesco said memories of the three-goal comeback against Barcelona would give Roma hope for the second leg. \u201cLet me remind you once again the tie is not over, and we have proved it,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe have shown we can come back. We scored three goals at home against Barcelona, so we can do it. If any of my players does not believe we can win, they can stay away from the second leg.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
