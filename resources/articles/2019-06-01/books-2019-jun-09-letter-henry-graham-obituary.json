It was an association he came to regret. In no way was Graham a \u201cpop poet\u201d, despite writing the line \u201ca three-piece suite for my sweet,\u201d with its nod to the Searchers\u2019 hit Sweets for My Sweet in Good Luck to You, Kafka, You\u2019ll Need It Boss. He also featured in Pete Roche\u2019s anthology Love Love Love, as a result of which he appeared on John Peel\u2019s Night Ride on Radio 1 in 1968."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
