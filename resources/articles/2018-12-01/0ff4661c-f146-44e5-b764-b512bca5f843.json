The same applies to his ability to make life difficult for Everton and deliver a viable Premier League concern to whoever takes ownership of St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle departed with a valuable and well-earned point as they responded impressively to Saturday\u2019s home defeat by West Ham, their only loss in six league games. It could have been three but for Jordan Pickford\u2019s fine late save from Christian Atsu and a poor finish from the same player when clean through on goal in the 90th minute. Not that Ben\u00edtez was complaining. Everton had sought a release from the misery of Sunday\u2019s freakish defeat in the Merseyside derby. Pickford\u2019s intervention aside, it proved beyond them. Fatigue and a lack of finesse in attacking positions ensured the after-effects of Anfield lingered for Marco Silva\u2019s team. \u201cWe had chances to win it at the end,\u201d the Newcastle manager said, \u201cbut they had won four home games in a row so to get a point in this stadium with the way things are going for us was a credit to our players. The application was fantastic. They have top-class players, players with World Cup and Euros experience coming from the bench, so our players have done a great job.\u201d Pickford received a rousing ovation from the crowd before kick-off \u2013 responding with an appreciative clenched-fist salute following his error at Liverpool \u2013 although the away section was predictably scathing in its reception for the born-and-bred Sunderland fan. The baiting intensified when the England No 1 was beaten from the first Newcastle attack of the game. Ademola Lookman, making his first league start of the season, was dispossessed in the Newcastle half. His appeals for a foul were ignored by the referee as Jacob Murphy raced down the left before delivering a precise cross low along the face of Pickford\u2019s goal. Kurt Zouma and Yerry Mina were unable to intercept and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n steered a powerful finish into the roof of the net at the back post. \u201cIt was a foul, possibly two, but that is not an excuse because we had to defend that situation better,\u201d said Silva. Everton, with Andr\u00e9 Gomes leading a composed display from central midfield, were not unduly disturbed by the setback. The left-wing partnership of Richarlison and Lucas Digne was potent and it engineered excellent chances for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the recalled Cenk Tosun before the interval. Sigurdsson was foiled by a superb block from Federico Fern\u00e1ndez while Tosun volleyed straight at Martin Dubravka when picked out by another Digne cross. The home side had levelled at that stage and a 2-1 lead, seconds before the interval, could have changed the complexion of the contest entirely. Dubravka had produced a fine save from Richarlison after the ball broke from Lookman, who again claimed to have been fouled in the build-up and again in vain. The resulting corner by Sigurdsson took a slight deflection off Jamaal Lascelles and fell invitingly for Richarlison to scoop the ball over the goalkeeper at the back post. Parity and possession did not produce a commanding second-half display from Everton, who looked heavy-legged and were easily contained by Newcastle\u2019s five-man defence. Lookman and Tosun were fresh but struggled to seize their chance to impress in the starting line-up. The Everton manager admitted: \u201cLookman performed like I expected; he had some good moments and some not so good moments. Like the team. Same with Cenk. Newcastle came here with one thing in mind \u2013 to keep a strong defensive organisation with nine or 10 players behind the ball and they achieved what they wanted. We didn\u2019t create enough chances in the second half to change the result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
