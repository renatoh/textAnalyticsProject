Unfortunately Mr Sedgwick's experience is all too common in the NHS, in Birmingham and elsewhere. His is one of many cases we could cite of delayed and unsatisfactory treatment caused by the poor infrastructure and chronic under-staffing which years of underfunding have produced. The current government, despite its promises, has done little to improve the situation. Neither major party while in government has had the political will to grasp the nettle of underfunding, and we seem no nearer a health ser vice comparable to those of other western countries. A true debate on how the NHS should be funded is stifled by both parties. Instead politicians tinker with management. Constant reorganisations (we are shortly to be subjected to another with the reduction in the number of health authorities) do nothing to improve patient care and serve only to divert the energies of many dedicated managers and staff away from what they should be doing - caring for patients. Dr Peter Nall Dr Jackie Fox Dr Harminder Surdhar Birmingham \u0095 I was interested to read Matt Seaton's article (Taking on the health service, May 18). My elderly mother died as a result of medical negli gence while in the care of a nursing home and a callous doctor. Unlike Matt Seaton, my family and I managed to get hold of the nursing home records fairly quickly and as these told their own dreadful story we also felt we had an open-and-shut case. We decided to seek independent arbitration via the NHS complaints procedure and the ombudsman. During the laborious complaints procedure we, as unrepresented complainants, had to contend with the local health authority and the ombudsman, each with their own team of legal advisers and medical assessors. Investigations are carried out in secret - unlike legal investigations - and complainants have no access to any information gathered. Our high hopes of a thor ough investigation and impartial hearing were dashed. Documents obviously went unread. The ombudsman's staff were dilatory in answering correspondence and although it is three years since my mother died, our questions have neither been acknowledged nor answered. Non-adversarial investigations must be thorough, honest and, above all, impartial. Matt Seaton had a fair hearing within an open system and was represented by someone who was able to ask questions, demand answers and fight for his cause. Sadly, the system of independent arbitration set up to settle NHS claims is an entirely different ballgame played on an uneven pitch with movable goalposts.
