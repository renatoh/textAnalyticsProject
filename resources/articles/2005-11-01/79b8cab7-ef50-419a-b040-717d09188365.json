England's coach likes his talent laced with resilience and adaptability and, so soon after a victorious Ashes summer, no one is about to question that. So how do you respond if you are comfortably the most talented young spin bowler in the country and yet don't tick any of Fletcher's boxes - apart, perhaps, from the one that says \"I do not wish to be contacted\"? Monty Panesar is a left-arm spinner in the classical mould. At 23, he might have won the learner's place on England's tour to Pakistan - the one that went instead to Alex Loudon, Warwickshire's off-spinning all-rounder, because Loudon can bat a bit, has the semblance of a doosra and is said to be made of the right stuff. Panesar cannot bat and his fielding at the national academy sent Rod Marsh, the former director, into despair. But he took 46 championship wickets for Northamptonshire last summer at 21.54 and that takes some ignoring. But in the weeks since England's squad to tour Pakistan was announced, Panesar proclaims that he has found his own mentor - a man to teach him the essence of togetherness and passion, words that are central to Fletcher's philosophy. The lesson has not come from a heavy-jowled Zimbabwean with the merest hint of a Mona Lisa smile. It has come from a Sikh guru from the Nanaksar movement, whose tenets include abstention from alcohol and celibacy for its holy men. Panesar spent a month on a Nanaksar farm near Edmonton in Canada, helping with the harvest, and was inspired by a sense of community. If he is to become the first Sikh to play cricket for England, he aims to be a model pupil. \"I have never spoken to Duncan,\" he said. \"But now I know what is required to play for England. To go to Canada and meet the master was fantastic, the defining moment in my life. He told me to go home and concentrate on the cricket, to go full whack and give it my passion. That's what I aim to do. He has really motivated me.\" Panesar's emergence would be a boon for England. Ashley Giles, the slow left-arm incumbent, has proved his survival qualities, but he is 33 and the next time an India or Pakistan tour comes round the succession may well have been decided. Fletcher, who calls Giles his \"faithful hound\" after a South African red wine, would have to learn to appreciate an altogether different tipple. \"I have always believed in my master,\" said Panesar. \"He is my guru. He is my maharaji \"We did voluntary work on the land, harvesting the wheat and the canola and all united together. There was a feeling of togetherness and passion. There were strong binds and a sense of love. I have always been willing to do everything for the team, to have that sense of togetherness, but this has brought it all home to me.\" Panesar, misguidedly, did not win an academy place this winter. In his time at Loughborough, his method of running around the ball to round it up like a playful dog left Marsh astounded. Instead, he leaves next week for a month in Adelaide, where he will work under the tutelage of the former Australia batsman Darren Lehmann. \"The message was sent to me that I need to work harder at my game - my batting and my fielding, my speed and agility - and I want to do that,\" he said. \"Now I've met the master, I'm not worrying about the past or the future, I'm living in the moment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
