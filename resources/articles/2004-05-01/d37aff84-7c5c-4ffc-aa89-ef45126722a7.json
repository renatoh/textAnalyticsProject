The Tigers, four points adrift in the table after losing their first 10 matches, yesterday unveiled Hanley as a coaching consultant alongside Gary Mercer, the former New Zealand international who took over on a caretaker basis when Graham Steadman was sacked three defeats ago. Hanley and Mercer were former team-mates at Leeds and they will pick the team together for the crucial home match against relegation rivals Salford on Sunday. Hanley has an unrivalled pedigree, not only as one of the all-time playing greats but also as a coach after steering St Helens to the Super League title in his only season in charge when they beat Bradford in the grand final in 1999. But he has been out of the game since his relationship with the Saints directors collapsed less than six months later, subsequently working in union with Bath, Bristol and as part of the England set-up. He had never hinted at any great desire to return, and speculation linking him with the Wigan job when Stuart Raper was sacked midway through last season proved wide of the mark. But now he has voluntarily embroiled himself in a relegation battle for the first time in his career - although he dismissed suggestions yesterday that he was therefore facing his greatest challenge. \"I have always been under pressure as a player and a coach,\" said the 43-year-old. \"Pressure does not faze me in the slightest. The biggest challenge is coming on Sunday. I have seen Castleford this season and they've deficiencies that need to be rectified very quickly. It's all about survival, we don't even need to think about the top eight.\" Castleford's chief executive Richard Wright explained that it was Mercer who persuaded Hanley to make himself available again. \"It is Gary's stature within the game that has attracted Ellery to the club,\" Wright said. \"It has become apparent since he has been in charge that he does have many friends in the game and also a special relationship with Ellery Hanley. \"Ellery comes here with a great reputation as a winner and it is that winning mentality that we want him to instil into the players.\" Castleford have already strengthened their squad for Sunday's game by signing the England A scrum-half Luke Robinson on loan from Wigan, and yesterday confirmed that the New Zealand utility player Motu Tony has joined them from the Brisbane Broncos, with his debut likely to come in London tomorrow week. Hanley's presence guarantees Castleford far greater media exposure for the rest of the season, but whether this bold gamble also brings the results they need, only time will tell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
