The environment secretary\u2019s campaign was blown off course at the weekend after revelations about cocaine use. But on the day the Tory leadership contest launched in earnest, Gove insisted he was still \u201cin it to win it\u201d. The backbench 1922 Committee announced that 10 contenders have mustered the support of the eight MPs they need to proceed to the first round of voting, with remainer Sam Gyimah the only one not to make the cut. MPs will hold the first round of voting on Thursday morning, with candidates who fail to win 17 votes or more being knocked out. Further rounds will be held next week, with the final pair of candidates then presented to grassroots Tory members for a vote. Gove launched his campaign with a slick event in a Westminster skyscraper, at which he delivered a punchy speech, without notes. He spoke about his \u201creforming zeal\u201d as education, justice and now environment secretary, and highlighted what he said was his successful record. The speech was peppered with policies, including pledges to abolish business rates for small and medium-sized businesses, protect ex-service personnel from prosecution over historic cases, and \u201ccreate institutes of technology, with high quality vocational education, in every town.\u201d Gove\u2019s performance was also laced with jibes about the overwhelming favourite, whom he referred to as \u201cMr Johnson\u201d. The pair\u2019s bitter rivalry stems back to 2016, when Gove knocked Johnson out of the leadership race. This time, Gove said, \u201cif I get through, which I\u2019m sure I will actually, to the final two against Mr Johnson this is what I will say to him. Mr Johnson, whatever you do, don\u2019t pull out.\u201d Gove was also critical of Johnson\u2019s flagship tax policy, which drew fire from other candidates on Monday, including Dominic Raab. Johnson has said that if he becomes prime minister, he will increase the higher-rate income tax threshold at which the 40p rate starts to be paid, from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. The plan would cost around \u00a310bn, with the benefit going to the highest earners. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the policy \u201cirresponsible and shameful,\u201d at a time when schools and policy forces are facing cuts. Gove said, \u201cone thing I will never do as prime minister is to use our tax and benefits system to give the already wealthy another tax cut\u201d. He said he was in favour of tax cuts, but \u201cthe poor must come first\u201d. In another implied criticism of Johnson, who has so far carried out few media interviews, Gove said he would confront Jeremy Corbyn directly rather than hide in a \u201cbunker\u201d. And he added: \u201cThese are serious times; we need a serious leader. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, the consequences couldn\u2019t be greater.\u201d Gove said he had \u201cled from the front\u201d during the Vote Leave campaign, and been \u201ctested in battle\u201d. Confronted with the question of whether he had been hypocritical in taking cocaine, and going on to oversee as education secretary a system in which teachers would be sacked for doing so, he said he had learned from his mistakes. Gove said that as justice secretary he had championed rehabilitation, seeking to emulate Winston Churchill\u2019s promise always to look for \u201cthe treasure in the heart of man\u201d. Johnson gave his own rousing address to Tory MPs on Monday evening, telling the right-wing 92 group that he was an election-winner. \u201cI will do for this country what I did for London where we were able to lift the poor and the needy in our society while also sticking up for the wealth creators. If we can restore this basic philosophy we will carry all before us,\u201d he said. Gove had been regarded by many at Westminster as the most formidable challenger to Johnson, whom he knocked out of the Tory leadership race in 2016; but foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has stolen a march on him in recent days. At his own launch, Hunt was introduced by work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt \u2013 two heavyweight supporters from opposite sides of the Brexit divide. Brexit has dominated the debate in the early stages of the race. Raab, who like Johnson resigned from the cabinet over the issue, has mooted the idea of suspending parliament if MPs try to block a no-deal Brexit in October. Johnson has also insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a revised deal with Brussels. But Gove has suggested he would be more flexible, if a delay proved necessary to complete a deal. The health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s campaign was boosted by the backing of Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington. Hancock\u2019s slogan is \u201clet\u2019s move forward\u201d. Gove was introduced by the Tory rising star Kemi Badenoch, the MP for Saffron Walden, with other prominent supporters, including Nicky Morgan and the education secretary Damian Hinds, looking on from the front row. In a frantic week of campaigning at Westminster, three more candidates \u2013 Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart \u2013 will hold launch events on Tuesday, with Johnson and home secretary Sajid Javid to follow on Wednesday. Javid has struggled to win as many endorsements as Hunt or Gove after his campaign got off to a slow start, but has won the coveted backing of Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
