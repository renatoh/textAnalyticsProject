It is surely only natural that M Chirac's focus on life after politics should have been sharpened in recent weeks, and given that the traditional North American lecture tour is unlikely to be a goer in his case, this desire to set himself up as a club turn suggests he has at long last found his level. However, it seems only fitting that we offer droit de reponse to a British expert on national character of similar standing. \"That bloody trainee corpse?\" Bernard Manning remarks of the French president. \"He'd not survive clubland, I tell you love. The French,\" he continues down the telephone from his Manchester home, \"The French wouldn't even be able to make jokes if we hadn't set them free.\" Bernard is similarly unpredictable on our neighbours' cuisine. \"I'd never eat them frogs' legs, they'd be forever kicking the peas off the plate. Tell you what, me dad was always telling me, if you go to Paris, don't ever go to the Folies Bergeres. One day I went to Paris, and I passed the Folies Bergeres. So I walked in, and there was me dad, sat in the front row ...\" Mm. There is no room, alas, for Bernard's measured discourse on Vichy France. Another time, perhaps. \u00b7 Inspired by the above, the Diary's Simon Goodley calls the French embassy. The initial attempt to locate anyone bar the receptionist fails - \"You're closed for lunch, presumably?\" \"Yes\" - but eventually Simon is able to tell the press office how much we enjoyed M Chirac's turn. He'll be familiar with our own Professor Bernard Manning's work in international relations, and we were very much hoping we could book the president to participate in a joke-off with the latter. \"OK,\" comes the vaguely unexpected reply. \"We will let you know.\" \u00b7 A dip into the strange but true files, next, with the exclusive revelation that Lord Chancellor Charlie Falconer's brother is a Scientologist. Seriously. Not sure what to add, really, other than to wonder how the PM can possibly think Fatty has the authority to persuade people he should be the only chap simultaneously part of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary when he can't even persuade his own sibling that he is not a thetan surrounded by invisible alien parasites sent to earth 75 million years ago by the galactic tyrant Xenu. Still, live and let live. \u00b7 We're distraught to have skipped it to watch Neighbours, but on Monday Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster John Hutton spoke on EU regulation at a Fabian Society lunch, where one of the lucky guests mentioned that she had worked for Harold Lever (chancellor of the DoL under both Wilson and Callaghan). \"Perhaps we can talk more about it later,\" John replied eagerly, \"and you can tell me what I'm meant to be doing. I've not been given a brief yet.\" Ah well. No rush. \u00b7 What an immeasurable relief to learn that U2 frontman Bono has achieved his aim to make trouser pilfering history, and won a lengthy legal battle to recover a pair of kecks - \"memorabilia\" - from a former stylist to the band. The music industry is of course famous for its grasp of life's more glaring ironies, but attempts to coax Bono's record company into revealing how many tens of thousands of pounds will be handed to lawyers as a result of this case meet with a tantalising silence. \u00b7 Although while we're on the subject, it would be a shame not to repeat a vignette from last week's BBC documentary on the original Live Aid. Despite being one of the least known bands on the bill at that time, U2 took the graceful decision to pull out of the concert at 2am the night before because, like all other artists, they were not being permitted a sound check. \"Fuck off then,\" was Geldof's weary response. And would you believe, the band pitched up on the big day after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
