Craig Morley, who is standing in the marginal Labour-held seat of Reading East, a key target for the Tories, has a long explanation on his website of why he believes the \u201cdangerous climate change theory relies on shaky evidence\u201d. Morley, a former Foreign Office official who held a job as head of climate change and energy policy for south China, says the evidence for human-caused climate change is incontrovertible but goes on to claim scientific models have \u201coverexaggerated\u201d the trend of warming and are unable to predict its consequences. On his official website, a post written in the past year says: \u201cThe alarmism and lexicon of emergency used in the current debate has lost sense of reality and proportion. There is no developing catastrophe and no smoking gun. \u201cWe used to have a science where scientists make a claim or hypothesis, and then tested it against independent data. If they failed, they went back and started again. Today, all that seems to matter is who shouts the loudest. \u201cStripped of the theatre of hype, cheerleading rent-seekers, alarmist headlines, Extinction Rebellion stunts, climate emergencies and even Greta Thunberg\u2019s lectures, the stark truth is that the modern \u2018climate emergency\u2019 movement is about politics and wealth redistribution, not science. \u201cIt is a socialist Trojan horse for delivering failed socialist economic policies through using the emotive lexicon of \u2018emergency\u2019, disaster, and doom-mongering.\u201d Last month, Morley approvingly tweeted a Washington Post article highlighting the views of 500 \u201cscientists and professionals\u201d from Clintel, a Dutch climate science-denying thinktank endorsed by the UK\u2019s climate science-denying Global Warming Policy Foundation. In his tweet, Morley wrote: \u201cThere is consensus that Earth has warmed. There is no consensus on what will happen in future, or what the impacts will be.\u201d Morley\u2019s stance is at odds with his party. Michael Gove, the former environment secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, have both acknowledged there is a climate emergency, even though the government has not formally declared one and missed parliament\u2019s deadline for taking action to tackle the situation. Boris Johnson previously said climate change was a \u201cprimitive fear\u201d that was \u201cwithout foundation\u201d, but changed his position to accept climate science after becoming foreign secretary. The Tories are concerned they are being outflanked on environmental and climate issues by Labour. The party has released a series of Facebook adverts of its candidates standing in front of trees and green spaces, with their names on green backgrounds, which appear to be aimed at younger audiences. Responding to Morley\u2019s views, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said it was \u201cno wonder the Tory party is attracting climate deniers\u201d. She added: \u201cUnder the Tories, private investment in renewable energy is plummeting, support for solar and electric vehicles has been slashed and onshore wind has been effectively banned. \u201cAt this election, the choice is clear \u2013 this is our last chance to take action to protect future generations under Labour or allow the Tories to accelerate our planet\u2019s destruction.\u201d Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate change spokeswoman, said: \u201cIf ever voters needed a clear sign that the Tories weren\u2019t serious about tackling the climate emergency then here it is. \u201cWhether it\u2019s expanding Heathrow, scrapping renewable energy or threatening our capability to work with our friends in Europe, the Conservatives have delayed climate action at every turn \u2026 We need climate action now, not more Tory climate action deniers.\u201d Asked if he stood by the statement on his website, Morley said: \u201cTackling climate change is vital but independent experts and even Labour\u2019s own unions say their promises don\u2019t stack up. The GMB said \u2018wishful thinking doesn\u2019t generate the power we need to heat homes, keep the lights on and the economy functioning\u2019. \u201cThe reality is that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans would wreck the economy, putting up bills for hardworking families \u2013 and preventing any real progress on climate change. \u201cUnder a Conservative government, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other G20 nation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions faster than any other G7 nation since 2010.\u201d A Conservative spokesman gave a similar response, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll take no lectures from Labour. Under the Conservatives, we have led the world in tackling climate change, cutting emissions faster than any other G20 country, taking renewable electricity generation to a record level and becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero. \u201cWhile we make ambitious but achievable commitments to tackling climate change, independent experts and Labour\u2019s trade union donors say Labour\u2019s plans are \u2018utterly unachievable\u2019 and \u2018almost certainly impossible\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
