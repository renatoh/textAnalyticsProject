Here a Germany team featuring seven of the players who competed in the 2002 World Cup final showed they could combine all that with the indifferent as well. Nevertheless, after so much despair in Scotland about Berti Vogts underachievement with the national team, this represented a triumph of the will for the manager and his modest squad. Personified by their leader Paul Lambert, the best player on show, Scotland roused some spirit many had feared had been suffocated by miserable performances against the likes of New Zealand and the Faroe Islands. Much attention will now focus on whether Lambert, 33, will still be an international when Scotland go to Germany for the return fixture in September. That the match is in Dortmund, where Lambert had such an impact six years ago, might persuade him to postpone retirement. His decision will be announced in August. For Germany, though, this was more like a triumph of the wilful. Personified by Michael Ballack, Germany seemed to have no real interest in adding to their one-goal advantage even though victory would have meant a decisive step towards qualification for Euro 2004. Cynicism in international football has been gradually erased over the last decade, but on a beautiful summer's day in Glasgow, Germany proved that it is not dead. It meant it was difficult to disagree with the assessment of the Germany manager Rudi V\u00f6ller that the best thing about the afternoon was the atmosphere inside Hampden Park. \"It is a pity that spark did not transmit itself to the players,\" he said, as if he had no part in shaping the game's rhythm. So it was Scotland, not Ballack or the slightly livelier Bernd Schneider, who delivered the one glimpse of bright invention on the pitch as well the noise and colour off it. Trailing to Fredi Bobic's unchallenged first-half header, Scotland equalised with 21 minutes to go thanks to the quick thinking of Colin Cameron and the composure of his Wolverhampton Wanderers' colleague Kenny Miller. Awarded a free-kick following a handball by Christian W\u00f6rns, Cameron saw the relative disarray in the German back-line and nudged the ball forward to Miller and he scored with a low shot that beat Oliver Kahn to his right. \"They played it very cleverly and very fast,\" said Bobic, \"but then we gave it away very cheaply.\" To say Hampden went wild would be wrong. It went wilder. There had been fireworks, orange kilts, bagpipes and a chaotic Flower of Scotland sung as the Scottish FA tried to bury Germany in an avalanche of tartan clich\u00e9s before kick-off, and as it became clear that Scotland were not being outplayed, renditions of Proclaimers tunes roared around the stadium. Yet with Miller's partnership with Dunfermline's Stevie Crawford not forcing Kahn into a first-half save, it felt as if those fans would actually have to walk 5,000 miles to see Scotland score. An advertising hoarding read \"Neue energie\" but for all Lambert's prompting and Cameron's scuffling, W\u00f6rns, Carsten Ramelow and Arne Friedrich neutralised it smoothly. The standard of creative football from both sides was poor. Then in the 22nd minute Germany broke away, Schneider finding Torsten Frings neatly. Frings's cross was badly judged by Steven Pressley and Bobic's header was a formality. Scottish heads could have dropped at that but they stayed up. At half-time Vogts said he told his players to \"take a drink, relax\". Miller's moment, allied to Germany's lackadaisical approach and W\u00f6rns's 82nd-minute aberration 10 yards out, justified Vogts' self-belief. Many observers had considered it self-delusion but Vogts was able to talk about \"satisfaction\" afterwards. After so much criticism it would have been easy for Vogts to be smug but he was magnanimous instead and spoke of the long-term project of \"reconstruction\" in Scottish football. In the short-term Scotland have remained in contention in the group, although they could be third by Thursday morning if Germany and Lithuania both win. Complete renewal may be some way off, but at least this was a noisy act of tartan renovation.
