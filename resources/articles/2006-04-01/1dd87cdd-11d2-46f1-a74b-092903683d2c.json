Bolton manager Allardyce also believes that the credentials of Luiz Felipe Scolari stand up to close scrutiny, even if his heart tells him he would ideally prefer an Englishman to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson. Scolari has quickly emerged as the leading candidate, even if he and his current employers at the Portuguese Football Federation have attempted to distance themselves from the speculation. It was perceived that Scolari and Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren were in a two-horse race for the job, with Allardyce, Charlton's Alan Curbishley and Martin O'Neill becoming also-rans. But Allardyce today insisted: \"I'm still in the frame because no decision has been made yet. \"I've had my [interview] opportunity, and I hope that was good enough, but we will have to wait and see. I appreciate that, for the FA, this is the biggest decision they have had to make since appointing Sven.\" \"There's been a few changes in the structure at the FA since then, so those in position at the moment have a responsibility to take as long as they need to hopefully find the right man.\" With Scolari firmly in the running, the debate in recent days has centred on the possibility of the FA appointing another overseas coach. Even FIFA president Sepp Blatter has expressed his surprise that the FA are considering heading down such a route. Allardyce said: \"Being an Englishman, I'm bound to be biased in saying that an Englishman would be the best man for the job.\" However, Allardyce fully respects Scolari's CV as a former World Cup-winning coach with Brazil, and as Portugal's current manager, and claims the current Portugal manager cannot be overlooked. \"Not at all. Like everything else in this country, every job that becomes available is a worldwide attraction, not just confined to Europe or the British Isles,\" Allardyce added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
