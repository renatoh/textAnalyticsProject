Phil Spector and the Brill Building songwriters blew teenage angst to Gone with the Wind proportions, but the Pipettes offer EastEnders melodrama, brief tales of one-night stands and hard girls at school sung in estuary vowels with bubbly enthusiasm. It's heavy on Motown basslines, dramatic strings and love affairs that thrive and die on the dance floor. But the victim culture of the girl group classics is replaced by a punk-edged, polka-dot feminism. Why Did You Stay? shares a roaring motorbike with Leader of the Pack, except the hero speeds to single status, not death. \"But he was so sweet,\" chant the chiding backing vocals. \"Oh yeah?\" comes the lofty reply. \"Well I've had just about enough of sweet.\" After this infectious debut, so will you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
