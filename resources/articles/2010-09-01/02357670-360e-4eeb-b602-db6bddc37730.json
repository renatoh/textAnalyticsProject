We found 15 species on the wing and soon lost count of the number of individuals. I cannot recall seeing so many butterflies in such a small area and, without doubt, it's the warmth of this sheltered beach that's a key factor in their abundance. The cliffs shield wild flowers below from the prevailing south-westerlies and yesterday, with blue skies and only a few drifting clouds, their limestone walls reflected the sun's warmth on to this narrow strip of beach where only the slightest breeze disturbed the feeding insects. As we walked through dense patches of devil's bit scabious, scores of peacock butterflies \u2013 sometimes two to a flower head \u2013 rose and fluttered around us. Hemp agrimony, bird's-foot trefoil and knapweed attracted the attention of commas, common blues, red admirals and the only painted ladies we've encountered so far this year. Down here on the shore the floral calendar was a fortnight in advance of the cooler cliff top. Marjoram, releasing its aroma from underfoot, was already running to seed. Hips of downy rose, whose foliage yields a delicious resinous aroma when crushed between finger and thumb, had turned scarlet and were softening. It's a rare day when there is no cool breeze on the North Sea coast but yesterday, in this haven, butterflies shimmered through a heat haze that rose from the rock-strewn beach that had, until 30 years ago, been a dumping ground for colliery waste and still bears scars of industrial abuse. Now it's becoming a rich site for wildlife again, where colonising species inhabit the precarious zone between cliff scree and high-tide line. Most plants here are natives, with one notable garden escape. How montbretia, a native of the South Africa veld, became established \u2013 miles from the nearest garden \u2013 is a mystery, but its orange blooms, as incandescent as coal in a furnace, added a fiery hue to a hot afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
