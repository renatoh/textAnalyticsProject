Over the past 14 months we've discussed drug policy, race, the decline of the working class, the place of women in gangs and in the police, education and the welfare state, urban life, the post-industrial economy, politics, food, drink, clothing and more. We've analysed the themes and subtexts of The Wire from almost every angle, from its tragic, cyclical worldview to its parallels with the Iraq war, by way of comparisons with the books, films and TV programmes that preceded it and an exhaustive list of its funniest scenes. We've argued about the characters' motivations and lovingly recounted the fabulous slang and jargon they use to express them. But the one thing we've never really concentrated on is the acting, and this week, in this final blogpost, I wanted to remedy that, and raise a glass to the first-class cast of The Wire. Why have we ignored them? Partly it's because the themes of the programme have made for such interesting and varied discussion. But partly, I think, it's because the actors make it all look so easy. The stars were as unfamiliar to most viewers as the programme's setting when it started (one of David Simon's reasons for casting British and Irish actors in key roles), and, as such, verisimilitude was quickly established and largely maintained throughout. But this trick would never have worked without the help of some fine performers, most of whom seem to have sunk back into formulaic TV shows such as Fringe, Heroes and even Casualty since the programme finished, surely an indictment of the lack of decent parts in film and television for black actors. To see Michael K Williams have to make do with five or six lines in Gone Baby Gone \u2026 I felt like yelling at the screen: \"Don't you know who that is?\" The cast of The Wire aren't flawless. I've never been very impressed by Delaney Williams as Jay Landsman \u2013 his elaborate speaking style jars with the overall tone in my opinion \u2013 and, at a push, Aidan Gillen's accent can be a bit dodgy and Idris Elba sometimes gives some slightly strange line readings (\"Ain't shit\u2026 they could say\"). But that's just nitpicking, really. Below I've drawn up my top 10, but I could just as easily have come up with a top 20, with honourable mentions for almost everybody involved. But, in no particular order ... 1. Dominic West as McNulty It's easy to forget how much weight Dominic West carries over the course of the five seasons. The Wire usually sketches its characters through the accretion of tiny details, but with McNulty it's almost the opposite: he is the one character we see in the round, in almost every possible light. We get McNulty the policeman, the father, the husband (common-law and ex), the boyfriend. We see his family life, his sex life, his goals and ambitions \u2013 we even hear a few details about his misspent youth. We see him at sports games and out for dinner, see him happy and satisfied as well as seething and furious. West navigates all these twists and turns with confidence: always charismatic, sometimes likeable, sometimes utterly dislikeable. At one point he even tries his hand at comedy, when this English actor impersonates an American impersonating an Englishman. And in this final episode, when his bosses Rawls and Daniels corner him about the fake murders, he pulls a new McNulty out of the bag: chastened, almost humble. Being the closest thing The Wire has to a focal point is a big responsibility, and West handles it with aplomb. Spot on. 2. Tristan Wilds as Michael Tristan Wilds was in his mid-teens when he joined the cast of The Wire, taking on a role that can justly be compared to that other Michael, Al Pacino's character in The Godfather. Yet if anything Wilds's transformation from sensitive, relatively innocent youngster to coarsened, semi-reluctant gangster is more subtle than Pacino's \u2013 signalled more often than not through gestures and murmurs, punctuated by affecting swings back and forth from boy to man before he is finally trapped by the crushing inevitability of his new life. Our sympathy remains with him throughout. The celebrated \"summer past\" scene in series five is probably Wilds's high watermark. His performance is note-perfect: the length of time he takes to reply, the way he gulps slightly before speaking, his refusal to turn towards his friend, the look on his face as though he has just realised something dreadful about himself. It's a heart-stopping moment. 3. Felicia \"Snoop\" Pearson as Snoop Famously, Michael K Williams, who played Omar, met Felicia Pearson in a bar and couldn't tell if she was \"a young lady or a little boy\". Many viewers have experienced the same confusion. Pearson is as close to her screen character as any fan of Method acting might wish \u2013 she served four years for second-degree murder \u2013 and as far from a traditional actress as that suggests, many of her lines delivered in an inaudible mumble that has to be deciphered through subtitles. But she has a fantastic screen presence and a perplexing, androgynous charisma thrown suddenly into relief in her final scene by that unexpectedly moving last line: \"How my hair look, Mike?\" Pearson's best scene is probably that defiantly iconoclastic opening to series four, her trip to buy the nailgun, hilarious, cute even, but with an unmistakeable note of suppressed danger. \"You earned that buck like a motherfucker, man, keep that shit,\" she winningly tells the startled shop assistant after handing over far too much cash. A unique performer who utterly inhabits her role. 4. and 5. Michael K Williams as Omar and Wendell Pierce as Bunk I've grouped these two together because I want to talk about what to me is the key scene for both of their characters: their side-by-side confrontation about the routes their lives have taken played out sitting together on an old wooden bench. They are a study in opposites: Bunk, the policeman, is overweight, Omar, the thief, is trim; Bunk is smartly dressed, Omar casual; Bunk is full of repressed rage, Omar repressed emotion. Both Michael K Williams and Wendell Pierce are entirely in control of their performances here: Pierce shuffles heavily and quickly along the bench towards Williams, only able to stop himself striking the other man by standing up and pacing around. He breathes thickly as he recalls his childhood attempts to become one of the \"tough boys\" and the favour the tough boys did him by shutting him out. Williams sits, seemingly impassive, perhaps \u2013 we think \u2013 not really listening. But as Bunk walks away Williams continues to hold the pose, and it is clear that the conversation has affected Omar deeply. 6. Wood Harris as Avon Barksdale The gangsters D'Angelo, Avon and Stringer circle each other in a series of captivating scenes in seasons one and two, but, to me, Wood Harris's Avon is the stand-out. In series one he and D'Angelo go to visit a comatose relative in hospital, and initially Avon sits with his usual nonchalance, floppy in his chair, almost horizontal, his arms flapping as he makes his seemingly flippant, almost disrespectful point: \"What's up, baby, talk that shit now\u2026\" And then, on a sixpence, all humour is gone, and Harris becomes the voice of authority and experience as he tells D'Angelo: \"You only got to fuck up once. Be a little slow, be a little late\u2026\" It's all tinged with deep regret for his prone brother, and Harris pats the man's hand as he speaks, strokes his forehead. There's a vulnerability there that Avon is unafraid to show D'Angelo and Harris is unafraid to show us. He's similarly impressive in the scene where Cutty, a relatively senior member of his crew, tells him that he wants to leave \"the game\": thoughtful and menacing, listening intently and eventually delivering his verdict to another lieutenant, Slim Charles, who recalls that Cutty \"was a man in his time\". \"He a man today,\" rules Avon definitively. 7. Andre Royo as Bubbles Series five allows Andre Royo to give us a new Bubs, almost unrecognisable from the loveable, madcap caperer and shambling, drug-ravaged fiend we got to know over the previous seasons. In this final episode, we see him discussing a planned newspaper article about his life, and Royo gives us someone circumspect, brooding, a man gradually coming to terms with his guilt over the death of his friend. Royo was also particularly impressive in the scene where Bubbles took a HIV test \u2013 it was immediately obvious that he wanted it to be positive, that he would have viewed such an outcome as just punishment for his role in Sherrod's death and his own wasted life. An impressive transformation. 8. Chad Coleman as Cutty The characterisation of Cutty and his attempt to leave \"the game\" \u2013 one of the few success stories The Wire gives us \u2013 are a perfect example of David Simon and Ed Burns's default writing style: letting a little say a lot. From his first scene Chad Coleman's acting embodies this: through a sideways glance, a slight sigh, it is clear he has doubts about returning to his old career and that this might come to cause Avon - or himself - a problem. Coleman kept up this laconic style throughout, and was much missed when his role was downgraded for the fifth series. 9. Sonja Sohn as Kima Like West, Sonja Sohn's Kima has to do a lot of the heavy lifting, especially in the first series, when hers is the personal life that is explored in the most depth. Simon's admission that he wrote her as a \"man with tits\" suggests Sohn should get much of the credit for what is a richly untypical female character, one who rejects motherhood in a way rarely seen on screen or deemed acceptable in real life. Later, unfortunately, Kima becomes a bit more one-note, as she is in this final episode: a sharp-suited, straight-arrow homicide detective with little of the emotional ambiguity of her earlier incarnation. 10. Finally, Jamie Hector as Marlo Jamie Hector gives a startling performance, very different from the Stanislavskian realism the rest of the cast favour. Hector's Marlo is slow, still, coiled like a spring, imbued with lizard-lidded menace. He is intimidating, but until his jail-cell outburst \"My name is my name!\" in the penultimate episode it is never clear exactly why. (Most unexpectedly, he occasionally has almost boyish bursts of joy, as when he invites his No 2 Chris Partlow to Atlantic City.) In this final episode, we see him in new clothes, in a new setting \u2013 but the essence of Marlo remains the same. Unlike most of The Wire's main characters, Marlo has no sympathetic side \u2013 yet Hector's performance makes him utterly riveting. So that's it for The Wire from the re-up team. I've had a great time writing my pieces and arguing about them with you below the line, as well as debating the articles you wrote and the ones by my colleagues Steve Busfield, Saptarshi Ray, Mark Smith, Judith Soal, Simon Jeffery, Amelia Hodsdon and Haroon Siddique. I hope you've enjoyed yourselves too. Don't take this the wrong way, but maybe it's time we all tried watching something else. David Simon's new show Treme started in America on Sunday (here's a review from the New York Times) and I hope you'll all join us in blogging that when it comes to Britain later this year. Until then, though, the game is still the game \u2026 always. Quote of the week \"That was for Joe.\" Slim Charles does the right thing by his old boss. Those running totals in full Murders: up one \u2013 Cheese \u2013 to make a grand total of 82. Eighty-two murders in five years? What's all the fuss about? Looks like The Wire's Baltimore is as safe as Greater Manchester after all. McNulty giving a fuck when it's not his turn: one last bucking of the system, as he refuses to falsely implicate a mentally ill man in all of his fake murders, taking him up one to 43. Drunk: doesn't even get drunk at his own \"wake\". Is he turning over a new leaf (again)? Twenty-four drunken misadventures in 60 episodes. Not too disreputable, really. Dubious parenting: none: steady at eight. Bunk drunk: up one to 10 for a celebratory drink for Jimmy, who over the course of five seasons has categorically outdrunk him. Herc fuck-ups: one last fuck-up \u2013 helping Levy get Marlo off scot-free \u2013 taking him to 21. Oh dear. Omar stick-ups: RIP Omar. Final total of 17. The torch has passed to Michael. Bubbles attempting to get clean: the perfect ending: Bubbles has finally made it. Seven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
