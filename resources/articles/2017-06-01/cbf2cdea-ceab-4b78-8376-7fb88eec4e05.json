By the time Cook edged a turner from Ollie Rayner to slip for 193, two shy of his highest Championship score, the record books were dog-eared and relieved: this was Essex\u2019s largest ever opening stand (surpassing Graham Gooch and Paul Prichard\u2019s 316 against Kent here in 1994), and the largest partnership in any game between them and Middlesex. Without Cook, on ploughed Browne to 221; his last three centuries have all been doubles. He put on a rapid 129 with Varun Chopra, who would pilfer a 74-ball ton (moving from 50 to 100 in 23), containing six sixes, to set up a declaration on 542 for three, a lead of 296. Middlesex were left with 13 uncomfortable overs to get through in the dark, which they did despite a couple of scares to Mohammad Amir. They still trail by 269. Cook was the remorselessly accumulating senior partner \u2013 cutting, pulling and nudging as well as ever, and facing only 280 balls. He is the third of the 13 men with 10,000 Test runs, after Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Kumar Sangakkara, to have scored a century in this pink-ball round. Cook looks in very fine fettle indeed. Browne, having been dropped early in the day, was more elegant but less expansive until Cook fell, driving beautifully and getting after Ollie Rayner. Middlesex\u2019s formidable attack \u2013 which can struggle against lefties \u2013 had been tamed. To be in a position of such power having lost the second day to rain is just the latest example of Essex\u2019s seamless step up to life in Division One. They have made quite brilliant use of Cook\u2019s presence but they will be fine in his absence: they bat deep (Chopra was their eighth centurion this summer), even if they have not needed to be here. As Cook and Browne made hay, Haseeb Hameed\u2019s struggles for Lancashire continued. He made 23 before being pinned in front by Warwickshire\u2019s Rikki Clarke, meaning he has only 214 runs in 12 Championship innings this summer, at 19.45. Curiously, Hameed dropped to No3 to allow Jos Buttler to open Lancashire\u2019s second innings with a deficit of 48. Never mind, Buttler was soon dismissed by Keith Barker and Hameed came in at No3. Alex Davies, the other opener, looked in better touch in making 79 as Lancashire closed 130 ahead, and six down. The century scored by Andrew Umeed in Warwickshire\u2019s first innings 321 is the slowest in the Championship\u2019s history, in terms of minutes. It came from 429 minutes, overtaking (very slowly) WH Denton\u2019s ton for Northamptonshire v Derbyshire in 1914, which took 420 minutes. Eventually Umeed was ninth out, to Stephen Parry, for 113 from 392 balls in 494 minutes. Hampshire\u2019s Ian Holland (four for 16) and Gareth Berg (three for 26) ran through Somerset, who fell from 102 for one to 135 for eight on another rain-affected day, after the youngsters Eddie Byrom and Adam Hose put on 77 for the second wicket. Somerset trail by 76 going into the final day but rain has surely taken too much time out of the game for Hampshire to force a win. Nottinghamshire did not need Jake Ball \u2013 an update will come on his fitness tomorrow \u2013 to continue to assert their dominance over Kent at Trent Bridge. Going into the final day, the visitors lead by just 23, with three wickets \u2013 one of which is Darren Stevens, who retired hurt after being hit on the head by Harry Gurney \u2013 in hand. Having bowled Derbyshire out for 160, Glamorgan require 212 to win on the final day. However, they suffered a blow, losing their opener Jacques Rudolph to the day\u2019s final ball. Leicestershire closed 44 without loss, needing another 350 to beat Northamptonshire, who need 10 wickets. Alex Wakely and Rob Keogh racked up centuries as Northants declared their second innings on 289 for seven, which set Leicestershire 394 to win. No play was possible at Headingley or Chester-le-street, and there were just 44 overs at Hove. Gloucestershire moved to 150 for one (with Cameron Bancroft unbeaten on 69) in response to Sussex\u2019s 358 for nine declared."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
