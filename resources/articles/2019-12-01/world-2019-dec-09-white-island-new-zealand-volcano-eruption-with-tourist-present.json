Unstable conditions, toxic gases and ash fall prevented rescue teams from searching the island \u2013 which lies 30 miles from the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, in the Bay of Plenty \u2013 on foot. The country\u2019s most active cone volcano erupted at 2.11pm on Monday, sending up a huge plume of ash that was visible from the North Island. Police said about 50 people were on the island at the time, more than 20 of whom were Australian tourists. Twenty-three people have been rescued. All of those rescued had sustained injuries, mostly burns, police said, and seven people who were in a critical condition had been flown to hospitals in Tauranga and Auckland. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who visited the nearby coastal town of Whakat\u0101ne on Monday evening, said the situation was \u201csignificant and evolving\u201d. John Tims, the deputy police commissioner of district operations, said at least two dozen people remained on the island, but he could not be sure of the exact number. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island,\u201d he said. Ardern said she was liaising closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and police confirmed that those missing on the island were New Zealanders and foreign nationals. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed Australians had been \u201ccaught up\u201d in the eruption and offered emergency support. Kevin O\u2019Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the New Zealand Cruise Association, said a tour party of 30 to 38 people from the Ovation of the Seas had been touring White Island when the eruption took place, and the party had not returned. Their names and nationalities were being given to the police, he said. The ship would remain in Tauranga port at least overnight. Royal Caribbean, which owns the Ovation of the Seas, asked for prayers to be said for all involved. Ardern said police were unable to land on the island because of the danger of another eruption and dangerous, unstable conditions on the ground. A Red Cross web page has been set up for families to register missing relatives. It includes people from Australia, New Zealand, the US, the UK and elsewhere. Michael Schade, an American tourist, had just returned from the crater to a tour boat with his parents when the volcano erupted. When their boat returned to pick up survivors, some were in shock, and others burned \u201cto different levels of severity\u201d, he said. \u201cWe were all busy the entire time, just trying to stay out of the way of people who knew what they were doing and also just to help out wherever we could,\u201d he said of the return trip. Passengers handed over jackets and shirts, eye drops and water, and a human chain was formed to refill bottles so the injured could pour it on their burns. Dr Ken Gledhill, of GNS Science, said the volcano was unpredictable. \u201cIt was not a particularly big eruption,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like a throat-clearing eruption. \u201cIt showed increased activity for the last few weeks, so we raised the alert level.\u201d A level four alert was issued for the volcano, also known by its M\u0101ori name Whakaari, indicating that a \u201cmoderate volcanic eruption\u201d was possible, according to the science agency GeoNet. The scale runs from zero to five \u2013 a major eruption. St John Ambulance treated at least 20 people who were injured, with ambulance officers travelling to the island with the coast guard and seven helicopters, which had been dispatched with paramedics on board. A spokeswoman initially said the service\u2019s medical director would establish a triage unit on the island when he arrived, but this later proved to be impossible. A damaged helicopter shown in footage of the island belonged to Volcanic Air, a tour company based in Rotorua. The pilot and four passengers were unharmed and returned to the mainland via boat on Monday afternoon, a company spokesman said. \u201cVolcanic Air has confirmed it had a helicopter on Whakaari/White Island at the time it erupted this afternoon,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cFive people had flown to the island in the helicopter, but all are accounted for and have arrived back in Whakatane by boat.\u201d Footage taken from the volcano\u2019s crater camera appeared to show people in the area minutes before it erupted. About 10,000 people a year visit the volcano. The civil defence authority warned that the situation was hazardous \u201cin the immediate vicinity of the volcano\u201d, which is 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty. After the eruption the police blocked streets close to the sea, and the MetService weather agency warned pilots to avoid the area. White Island last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016, in which no one was hurt. Geological hazard trackers GeoNet had registered moderate volcanic unrest on the island for weeks before Monday\u2019s eruption. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 December 2019 because an earlier version misspelled the surname of Ken Gledhill, an earthquake expert at GNS Science, as Glairdhill.
