Hans Blix, the chief inspector, told reporters he wanted \"immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access\" to sites such as the defence ministry, interior ministry and Republican Guard headquarters as he entered the second day of talks. \"We'll see - the devil is in the details,\" he said. All the key negotiators are expected to shortly hold a press conference in Vienna to reveal the wording of the agreement on the return of the inspectors. However, citing sources close to the UN weapons inspectors team negotiating in Vienna, BBC Online reported that their were fears that the wording of the pending UN resolution on the issue could undermine the inspection mission. These came from anxieties that the provisions in the draft would include giving power by the permanent security council nations (the US, Britain, Russia, France and China) to recommend which sites should be checked and that at least one of the inspection team could be from those countries. President Saddam pledged unconditional access to sites across Iraq last month but Baghdad has since rejected the notion of a new UN resolution - wanted by the United States - that would broaden and toughen the inspection regime. An Iraqi cabinet spokesman said today that threats of war will not force the country to accept any new UN resolutions it finds objectionable. The negotiations are in part to determine how far Iraq will let the UN inspect government buildings and presidential palaces but also to amend a 1998 UN-Iraq agreement on inspections that restricted the inspectors' access to eight presidential sites. The decision on whether to amend the agreement will be taken by the UN security council when Mr Blix reports back on Thursday. However, the Bush administration is pushing for a resolution that would eliminate the 1998 conditions, saying that failure to comply would result in grave consequences. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said in a television interview yesterday that before inspectors returned to Iraq, Mr Blix would have to wait and see whether the security council came up with new guidance or additional resolutions that might require him to modify his plan. \"I'm pleased that he is in that state of readiness and we'll have to see how things develop over the next couple of weeks with respect to a resolution with new requirements,\" Mr Powell said. Mr Blix said the Iraqis and UN experts were finalising logistics such as where the teams would be based, their accommodations and security, and how samples would be taken out of the country for analysis. If the security council formally approves the mission it could begin by the third week of October. Meanwhile, delivering his keynote speech at the Labour party conference in Birmingham, the prime minister, Tony Blair, was unwavering in his stance on Iraq and his support for the US. Mr Blair said: \"My vision of Britain is not as the 51st state of anywhere, but I believe in this alliance and I will fight long and hard to maintain it.\" He went on: \"Let us lay down the ultimatum. Let Saddam comply with the will of the UN ... but here is the hard part: if he doesn't comply, then consider ... sometimes, and in particular dealing with a dictator, the only chance of peace is a readiness for war.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
