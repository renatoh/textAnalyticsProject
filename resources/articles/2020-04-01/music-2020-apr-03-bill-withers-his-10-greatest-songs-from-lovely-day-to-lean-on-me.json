Sure enough, on the cover of his debut album, the smiling 31-year-old singer-songwriter is holding his lunchbox in the doorway of his day job at a factory making parts for passenger jets. Featuring Booker T &amp; the MGs and Stephen Stills, Withers\u2019 blend of soul and folk wasn\u2019t exactly DIY but its charm lay in its downhome simplicity. He wrote his concise, perfect breakout hit after watching Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick as codependent alcoholics in Days of Wine and Roses. \u201cSometimes you miss things that weren\u2019t particularly good for you,\u201d he explained. His looping \u201cI know\u201ds express emotional stasis while Booker T\u2019s salving string arrangement lets in the light. Grandma\u2019s Hands (Just As I Am, 1971) Withers\u2019 earthy, unpretentious reputation was established from the get-go by this two-minute ode to his late grandmother, Lula \u2013 a modest masterclass in songwriting. This two-minute biography of a black woman, born shortly after the civil war, who met hardship with love, is told through a single image: the hands that clap in church and play the tambourine are the same ones that steer young Bill from danger and gather him up when he falls. The final line \u2013 \u201cIf I get to heaven I\u2019ll look for grandma\u2019s hands\u201d \u2013 feels especially poignant right now. Withers\u2019 hummed intro was memorably sampled on Blackstreet\u2019s somewhat less homespun No Diggity. Harlem (Just As I Am, 1971) I almost chose the extraordinary, hold-your-breath heartbreak of Hope She\u2019ll Be Happier but that\u2019s in the same emotional zone as Ain\u2019t No Sunshine. Harlem, his debut single and Just As I Am\u2019s opening track, shows another side to Withers: a gritty ghetto panorama in the vein of Bobby Womack\u2019s Across 110th Street and Stevie Wonder\u2019s Living for the City. The narrator has to negotiate callous landlords, crooked preachers and broken radiators, but Withers, typically, seeks a silver lining. Come Saturday night, he can still go out and party and \u201ceverything\u2019s all right\u201d. Even in hard times, he celebrates community and joy. Use Me (Still Bill, 1972) Self-produced and recorded with members of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Withers\u2019 second album is a much more physical record than his debut, with lyrics to match: two of the highlights are potent tales of sexual obsession. The paranoid suspense of Who Is He (And What Is He to You)? is his equivalent of I Heard It Through the Grapevine (with the implied twist that it may all be in his head) while the watchful groove of Use Me underpins a masochistic defence of a selfish, snobbish lover in defiance of well-meaning advice: \u201cIf it feels this good getting used / Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up.\u201d A very long way from Grandma\u2019s Hands, it was later covered by Grace Jones. Lean on Me (Still Bill, 1972) Withers\u2019 only US No 1 belongs to the same school of early 70s brow-soothers as Bridge Over Troubled Water and You\u2019ve Got a Friend but cuts the gospel richness with doses of handclapping funk. Lean on Me was inspired by his hardscrabble childhood in the mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, where neighbours looked out for each other. As he once explained: \u201cThat kind of circumstance would be more accessible to me than it would be to a guy living in New York, where people step over you if you\u2019re passed out on the sidewalk, or Los Angeles, where you could die on the side of the freeway and it would probably be eight days before anyone noticed you were dead.\u201d On Still Bill, where it follows the feverish Use Me and Who Is He (And What Is He to You?), Lean On Me\u2019s promise of unfailing brotherhood has real weight. I Can\u2019t Write Left-Handed (Bill Withers Live at Carnegie Hall, 1973) Live at Carnegie Hall belongs in the pantheon of great live albums, not just for the music but for the absurdly charming between-song patter: Withers\u2019 smalltown comedy routine prior to Grandma\u2019s Hands brings the house down. If half the power of I Can\u2019t Write Left-Handed resides in its mesmerising, Fatboy Slim-sampled gospel motif, then the other half comes from Withers\u2019 introductory spiel about the Vietnam war (\u201cone big drag\u201d) and his conversation with a young veteran who lost his right arm after a bullet to the shoulder. Framed as a letter home that the vet needs Withers\u2019 help to write, the song itself is an act of profound empathy and solidarity that says more about the average soldier\u2019s experience of war and its aftermath than a dozen more strident protest songs put together. And when Withers flows straight into Lean on Me, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s carrying the whole country on his shoulders. \u201cI have seen America and all the weird phases it has been through,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cAll the cruelty and all the kindness.\u201d The Same Love That Made Me Laugh (\u2019Justments, 1974) Four years before Marvin Gaye\u2019s divorce masterpiece Here, My Dear, Withers\u2019 third album chronicled the aftermath of his brief and publicly disastrous marriage to actor Denise Nicholas. Roughly speaking, The Same Love That Made Me Laugh blends the message of Ain\u2019t no Sunshine with the sound of Use Me to produce a song as seductive as it is despairing. \u201cI\u2019ve given all I have to give / And if you don\u2019t want me / I don\u2019t want to live.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t want to be in his shoes, but it sounds so good. It\u2019s All Over Now (with Bobby Womack, 1975) Withers was not a natural rocker but Bobby Womack was a persuasive man who managed to bring together two of the most distinctive voices in 70s soul. Womack wrote the song in 1964 but it was the Rolling Stones who made it famous, and this raucous duet coaxes a raw Stones-y energy out of a singer who usually operated in a more laidback mode. The way they throw lines back and forth in the chorus sounds like the recording was a heap of fun, at a time when Withers really needed some. Lovely Day (Menagerie, 1977) Withers considered his four-album run with Columbia Records pretty much a washout, accusing label executives of being crass, tin-eared and racist, but it did yield one of the most joyful songs ever recorded. The simple message is Lean on Me in reverse \u2013 this time it was Withers who needs his spirits lifted \u2013 and every note glows, thanks to producer Clarence McDonald and co-writer Skip Scarborough. \u201cThe way Skip was, every day was just a lovely day,\u201d Withers testified. Lovely Day isn\u2019t exactly disco but it offers its own version of dancefloor transcendence, from the chatty burble of the bassline to the \u201cdaaaaaay\u201d towards the end, which Withers sustains for a record-breaking 18 seconds in a rare instance of vocal showboating. It is impossible to hear this song without feeling better. Just the Two of Us (with Grover Washington Jr, 1980) Withers\u2019 only album of the 1980s, Watching You Watching Me, was his last before he retired at the age of 47, but before that he scored a Grammy-winning No 2 hit with a collaboration famous enough to be sampled or parodied by Will Smith, Eminem and Dr Evil. Withers\u2019 companionable warmth gels beautifully with Grover Washington Jr\u2019s saxophone and the very 80s silk-sheet production, although I can\u2019t help wondering what a stripped-down solo version might have sounded like. Withers called it \u201ca \u2018kiss my ass\u2019 song to Columbia\u201d. After that final painful album in 1985, he was done with the music industry and he never went back. \u201cThis business came to me in my thirties,\u201d he said a few years ago. \u201cI was socialised as a regular guy.\u201d \u2022 What are your favourite Bill Withers songs?
