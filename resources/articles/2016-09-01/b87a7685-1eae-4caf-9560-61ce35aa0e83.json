Celtic fell to a 7-0 defeat but their manager insisted that there was \u201cno embarrassment\u201d and that he could not have asked for any more from his team. \u201cProfessionally it is never nice when that happens,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201c[but] these are top class players and they have done that to much better teams than us.\u201d Rodgers admitted that he felt helpless watching from the touchline as Barcelona sliced his team apart with five second-half goals. \u201cThe speed of the pitch is fantastic, the ball moves like it is on an ice-rink, it goes so fast \u2013 and they go as fast as that,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight was hard, but there can be no embarrassment. Whenever you lose as a professional it is tough to take but [my] players have been brilliant. They couldn\u2019t have come to a more difficult place in world football after the highly intense game [against Rangers] at the weekend and to have hardly any preparation time against the world\u2019s best at keeping the ball; they beat you up with the football at times.\u201d Rodgers had said before the game that Barcelona\u2019s front three of Leo Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar might be the best in history and he reiterated that view after a match in which they scored three, two and one goals respectively. \u201cThey are very special players,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can put as many players as you want there \u2013 we had a line of five \u2013 but the movement, the speed and the touch can still make it very difficult for you. They have shown great quality this evening.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the other end, it is not so nice, but we can\u2019t be too downheartened. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re playing Barcelona or Berwick Rangers, there\u2019s still professional pride. But they are a team of top world-class players and this will not hamper us in any way. We have a lot of learning to do, we will recover, and the experience will be good for us.\u201d This was Celtic\u2019s 28th away game in the Champions League, of which they have now won just one and drawn one, losing 26. And while this was their heaviest defeat, Rodgers took some refuge in that record. He also repeatedly returned to the theme of tiredness from the weekend\u2019s Old Firm game while Barcelona, he said, were \u201csuper fresh\u201d having rested eight players, and lost, on Saturday. \u201cAway from home Celtic find it very difficult over many, many years,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cOur home games will be very important, where our supporters genuinely create an extra man for us.\u201d There may have been consolation too in the words of Barcelona manager Luis Enrique. \u201cWhoever we had had in front of us today would have found it difficult against us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little they can do to stop it when we play with this precision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
