You still haven't seen the best of me,\" Calzaghe added. \"We have tried to get unification fights at super-middleweight but nobody wants to know. In any case I have beaten Charles Brewer, who I believe is the best in my division after me. \"Since Hopkins beat Felix Trinidad last year, what has he done? Next to nothing. He wants to fight Roy Jones, but Jones is fighting John Ruiz as a heavyweight in March. So what else has he got? The only place Hopkins can make big money is by fighting me. \"Frank Warren is trying to make it happen, but if it doesn't come in the next six months it will be time to think about continuing as a light- heavyweight.\" Pudwill, 31, lasted the dis tance with the German Sven Ottke two years ago in an unsuccessful challenge for the International Boxing Federation super-middleweight title, but argues he is now better qualified to test Calzaghe. \"I was a little overawed by it all, the cameras and the lights. This time, though, I'm fit and I know what to expect.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
