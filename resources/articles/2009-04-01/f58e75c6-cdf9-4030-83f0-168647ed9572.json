Chelsea's stunning Champions League quarter-final first leg victory at Liverpool on Wednesday has prolonged hopes of securing silverware on three fronts this term under the temporary stewardship of Guus Hiddink, though Abramovich has recognised the need to inject new blood into the squad for next term. The owner has indicated that the majority new of arrivals will have to be funded through sales, but he has proved willing to fund one lavish signing per summer in the past and is prepared to do so again to secure Villa. The Spain striker, whose burgeoning reputation was confirmed with his searing performances en route to winning Euro 2008, is effectively being touted around Europe by Valencia as the Primera Liga side teeter on the brink of bankruptcy. Such are their crippling debts that they will listen to offers for any member of their first-team squad, though the 27-year-old remains their principal asset having previously attracted interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester City. They will be unable to resist any serious offers this summer. Valencia have been seeking some \u20ac50m (\u00a345m) for Villa, a figure that may prove beyond the two Spanish clubs who court him, which would beat the \u00a332.5m paid by Manchester City for Robinho last September. Yet, while they may consider a sale at slightly under that value, they will welcome Chelsea's interest to ensure they receive a competitive fee for a player who has scored 80 top-flight goals in his four years at the Mestalla. The striker himself has previously made it clear he is reluctant to leave Spain, though that stance may mellow when Chelsea's interest crystallises or, indeed, if the Londoners secure a first European Cup. Such success would add to their reputation on the continent. The prospect of Villa following his Spanish strike partner Fernando Torres to the Premier League is tantalising, particularly given the attacking brilliance already demonstrated by Chelseain their defeat of Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday. While money is tighter at Stamford Bridge these days after the excessive spending of Abramovich's first few years in charge, the Russian remains enthusiastic and committed to the cause, and has acknowledged the need to add to the squad by indicating to senior players that he will attempt to lure the Spaniard to Stamford Bridge. \"Generally speaking we'd like to use internally generated cash to buy new players and, by that, I mean sell players and buy new players,\" said the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, following the declaration of the club's accounts in February. \"But, if an appropriate player comes along who falls outside that cash flow, then money would be available from the owner to buy that player. But it would all depend on the player and the circumstances.\" Chelsea have yet to appoint a long-term successor to Luiz Felipe Scolari, but no manager would be unhappy at the prospect of inheriting a striker as potent as Villa. Hiddink will be consulted by Abramovich ahead of the summer's squad strengthening but has indicated that he will leave his dual role with Chelsea and the Russian national team to return to duties in Moscow in May, with the Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti having emerged as the primary target to replace him. The Italian was considered last summer and contact is understood to have been made with his representatives last month, though the 49-year-old is under contract at the San Siro until the end of the season with an option for a further season. Chelsea will monitor that situation closely, in the hope that Ancelotti will give real consideration to a move to England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
