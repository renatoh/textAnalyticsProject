The guidelines, first issued in September, require telecoms companies to deploy \u201cartificial intelligence and other technical methods\u201d to check the identities of people registering SIM cards. All physical stores in the country have had until 1 December to begin implementing the new standards. The measure, described by the ministry of industry and information as a way to \u201cprotect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace\u201d, makes Chinese mobile phone and internet users easier to track. Already, mobile phone users are required to register SIM cards with their identity cards or passports and many telecoms had begun scanning customers\u2019 faces since last year. Many social media platforms also require users to sign up with their \u201creal-name identities\u201d via their phone numbers. The expansion of the use of facial recognition in China, from middle schools to concert venues and public transport, has begun raising concerns about information security and consent. In November, a professor filed what is believed to be the country\u2019s first lawsuit against the use of facial recognition. Guo Bing, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University alleged that a safari park in Hangzhou violated the country\u2019s consumer rights protection law by scanning his face and taking his personal data without his consent. China\u2019s education ministry said in September it would \u201ccurb and regulate\u201d the use of facial recognition after parents grew angry when facial recognition software was installed without their knowledge at a university in Nanjing to monitor students\u2019 attendance and focus during class. Experts also caution that China lacks regulation on how facial recognition can be used. More than two dozen Chinese technology companies have begun drafting national standards for the industry. Human rights advocates described the measure as another step toward \u201cdystopian surveillance state\u201d, in which Chinese cities will more closely resemble the Xinjiang region, where citizens are constantly monitored for signs of unrest or dissent. The ministry has said the rule will protect citizens from phone scams and prevent the reselling of SIM cards as part of cybersecurity and antiterrorism campaigns. On the microblog Weibo, many internet users were supportive of the move, with one writing: \u201cAs someone who has had their identity stolen, I feel relieved.\u201d Another said: \u201cEven though this is coming too late, I support it.\u201d But others were not confident the new rule would strengthen information security. One user wrote: \u201cIf privacy laws are not sound \u2026 then you really do not have the right to require more and more personal information from the people. We just want to live in a society where our information is safe. Why is it so difficult?\u201d In response to mobile phone users submitting to face scans, one commentator said: \u201cI will not. My number has already been sold and now my face will be too? Another said: \u201cPlease leave us with some privacy.\u201d \u201cThere is not even a little space for freedom. Everything is controlled. You cannot say what you want or choose what you want,\u201d another said. Lillian Yang contributed additional reporting"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
