That was a pretty impressive performance by our boys, to beat a side like Huddersfield. To say I'm pleased is an understatement. The confidence we'll get from this is immeasurable.\" Widnes were missing several senior players including their captain Kevin Brown, and trailed 10-0 to early tries from Jermaine McGillvary and Leroy Cudjoe, and 20-12 with 13 minutes remaining after Danny Brough had converted an Eorl Crabtree score then added two penalties. But Joe Mellor, the former Wigan scrum-half who was described by Betts as \"the best player on the pitch by far\", pounced on some sloppy Huddersfield handling to scamper between the posts and put the game back in the balance, then Jack Owens somehow offloaded the ball in the corner for the Australian full-back Rhys Hanbury to score his second try. Huddersfield have now dropped three points in two matches after their impressive opening victory at Wigan, and their coach Paul Anderson conceded that his team had been \"outfought\". \"There's expectations on us now after what we did last year, and teams are going to get stuck into us,\" Anderson said. \"We've got to learn to handle it better.\" They will have a formidable test next Friday in a Yorkshire derby against a Leeds team who maintained their 100% record with a 40-12 romp against the struggling Catalan Dragons in Perpignan. Ryan Hall scored his first two tries of the season to enter Super League's all-time top 10, passing the tally of 138 scored by Keiron Cunningham during his long and distinguished career with St Helens. On the opposite flank Tom Briscoe scored his fifth try in three appearances since joining Leeds from Hull during the winter, and the captain Kevin Sinfield claimed 16 points from a try and six goals. The result increases the pressure on the Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous. The Dragons have now conceded 21 tries and 108 points in losing their first three games of the season and are in danger of being sucked into the battle to avoid relegation. Castleford are joint top with Leeds and St Helens after the wing Richie Owen scored a hat-trick in his first appearance of the season in a 30-10 win at Hull KR. The Tigers overcame the loss of Liam Finn to the sin-bin late in the first half in a lively contest, Marc Sneyd kicking impeccably as they rival Widnes as the season's surprise packet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
