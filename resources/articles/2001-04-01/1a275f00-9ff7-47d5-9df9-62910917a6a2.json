The reader chuckles knowingly as Melissa struggles with the idiosyncracies of British life, but when she starts to snack in the dead of night (six jammy dodgers, v. bad) and dither over the advances of a nice young man, it's hard to see where the story is heading. Ford's problem, alas, is too little plot and a heroine so ineffectual it becomes hard to engage with her, however cute her observations on love, life and the delights of the English pudding. Kate Walbert, another American, has crafted the kind of old- fashioned novel that is increasingly hard to come by: beautifully written, painstakingly structured and seemingly effortless in its evocation of place and character. Set in America in the shadow of the first world war, The Gardens of Kyoto (Virago, \u00a39.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL focuses on cousins Randall and Ellen, romantically united in their love of literature and sense of mystery. Although Randall is killed in action at 17, his spectre - sensitive, otherworldly, posthumously ideal - presides over the narrative like the ghosts he could see when alive. When Ellen meets the man who will be the father of her child, she begins to weave intricate fantasies around a less than consummate relationship. Unlike the Japanese gardens of Kyoto, which escaped destruction in 1945 (a magical, ephemeral world that Randall introduced her to in books), nothing can save Ellen from the disintegration of her fabricated romances. Tortuous revelation is also central to Akhil Sharma's dark and disturbing An Obedient Father (Faber, \u00a39.99). Buy it at a discount at BOL Set in the author's native India at the end of the last decade, it is mostly narrated by Ram, a fat, disconsolate, wheezing drunk, who lives in one of the city's slums with his widowed daughter Anita and his eight-year-old granddaughter. His job as a bribe-collector ensnares him in a bureaucracy so corrupt that everything is up for sale - including family loyalty. Ram's real confession begins, however, when Anita catches him late at night with his granddaughter. What follows is a truly gruesome account of how he treated Anita to years of sexual torment as a child. Sharma's lyrical descriptions are balanced by a relentless critique of a corrupt and moribund administration. It is this unflinching adherence to truth-telling that makes Ram's story digestible all the way through to its macabre conclusion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
