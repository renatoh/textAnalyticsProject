Wanderers remain rooted to the bottom of the table, having scored just six times in the league, despite their international exploits. The Mariners are little better, having failed to win since the opening round of the A-League and netting just 10 times in 13 games. Shannon Cole and goalkeeper Ante Covic were among the players who went over to acknowledge supporters at the end of the game, but ended up in a forthright exchange of views and angry finger-pointing. One fan had to be held back from trying to jump the fence. Neither side seemed capable of producing the guile needed to prise open the other\u2019s defence. Both created a number of chances, but lacked a clinical finisher. The Wanderers had most of the best opportunities in the first half until the last minute, when Covic produced a triple save. He parried a long range effort and reacted quickly to block closer range efforts from Nick Fitzgerald and Josh Rose. The Mariners wasted a series of free kicks within 30 metres of the Wanderers goal and repeatedly wildly shot from distance in the absence of any more imaginative ideas. Nikita Rukavytsya was the Wanderers\u2019 primary attacking threat in the first half. In just the second minute, he was foiled by Mariners goalkeeper Liam Reddy and had another attempt on target later in the half, while Labinot Haliti headed a chance straight at the Central Coast keeper. Haliti put another header wide in the second half, in which Mariners fullback Josh Rose was a central figure at opposite ends in the first few minutes. He cleared an acrobatic scissors kick from Wanderers debutant Nick Kalmar off the line, then flicked the roof of the net with an attempt at the other end. Both coaches bemoaned their team\u2019s continuing lack of luck in front of goal, but drew some encouragement. Wanderers boss Tony Popovic said his side was still playing with belief and their positive approach would yield rewards down the track. \u201cI felt throughout the 90 minutes that only we would win the game,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cBut it was also important not to throw it away. \u201cThe players are still patient, still believing, but the good play is just not being rewarded with goals.\u201d Mariners coach Phil Moss was happy his team had a clean sheet after conceding seven goals in their previous two games. \u201cI think we\u2019ve started the new year on a very good foot coming here and getting a point against an absolutely desperate Wanderers side,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThey probably dominated us for periods in the first half, but I felt we were probably the more dominant team in the second half.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
