HSBC Republic Bank has made the move to recover a \u00a34.28m personal loan granted to Mr Bright last December which was secured against his substantial shareholding in the insurance company, at the time worth about \u00a360m. The action is embarrassing for HSBC which also acted as Independent's advisers and along with auditor KPMG, and actuary Watson Wyatt, is being watched closely by the financial services authority, the City regulator. It is understood that self-made Mr Bright, who founded the business in 1987 and floated it eight years ago, raised the loan to buy more stock in Independent. Attempts to retrieve the money began last month as Independent's shares were suspended at 81.5p, less than a quarter of their value six months ago. But Mr Bright repaid only \u00a35000 of the loan, prompting HSBC to serve a writ in the high court two weeks ago. It is seeking repayment of the loan plus interest of almost \u00a3850 a day. How much the bank will recover is debatable given the fact the Independent is in provisional liquidation and Mr Bright's 6% stake is virtually worthless. However he does have three homes, a yacht and and a fast car he could cash in. More significant is the liquidity of his company pension, which is believed to contain up to \u00a311m. Provisional liquidator PricewaterhouseCoopers is looking into that. Earlier this week it sold Independent's loss-adjusting arm to Royal Sun Alliance for \u00a33m, saving 300 jobs. It is unclear as yet whether Mr Bright took out any more personal loans through private banks. He resigned as chief executive of Independent in April after the extent of the group's financial troubles emerged. He finally quit the company as deputy chairman four weeks ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
