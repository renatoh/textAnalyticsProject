Vaughan, whose knee collapsed on Monday during England's warm-up match against Pakistan A in Lahore, has been making good progress during the past couple of days but always seemed likely to miss the opening Test. He is to remain with the party and continue intensive treatment in the hope that he will be fit for the second Test in Faisalabad at the end of next week. It is the second time that Trescothick, unofficial vice-captain of the side, has deputised for Vaughan. Last year, the captain hurt the same knee while batting in the nets in preparation for the first Test against New Zealand and Trescothick led the side to a victory notable for being Andrew Strauss's first and Nasser Hussain's last. \"Losing Michael is a big blow,\" Trescothick admitted yesterday evening. \"He is right up there in the top two or three captains in the world now and his leadership certainly played a great part in the Ashes series last summer. It is almost like having an extra player. \"I have nothing to prove though. I have been his right-hand man for a while now and we feed off each other. We may have different styles. I am more than happy to be my own man.\" Though Trescothick had no doubts about holding the job temporarily, he is less keen to take over in the long term. \"I have seen Michael go through some tough times and it has probably put me off a bit,\" he said. \"I drive him to games at home and he talks and I listen. I know how hard it is for him to switch off. It is a 24-hour job even when he is back at home, with so much to deal with outside the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
