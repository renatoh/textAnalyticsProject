Care to examine the Ts&amp;Cs?), to 500MB per month. For most people that will be enough. But regardless of that, the posting that introduced it suggests that T-Mobile is actively trying to foment confusion about the difference between the web, internet, browsing, video and, well, data. Here's the post (which doesn't have comments open - how odd), with our comments. \"Changes to Mobile Internet fair use policies\" Hmm, we're already not liking this one. How often does this presage \"lots more data for everyone! Yay!\" \"T-Mobile is the only operator to give customers the Mobile Internet for a fixed price. We never charge our customers more than they expect for their Mobile Internet in the UK. \" The mobile internet? Which is the same as the internet, yes? We haven't seen anyone defining it differently. Though stay tuned.. \"Therefore you'll never need to worry about how many emails you've sent, how long you've been online or the data/GBs\" \"the data/GBs\" - oh, not the data per gigabytes, but the \"data, or gigabytes\". OK, so: you'll never need to worry about how much data you've used? That sounds great! But wait - why then is this post headed \"changes\"? \"Browsing means looking at websites and checking email, but not watching videos, downloading files or playing games. We've got a fair use policy but ours means that you'll always be able to browse the internet, it's only when you go over the fair use amount that you won't be able to download, stream and watch video clips.\" Pardon? I mean, really, what?? Browsing doesn't mean watching videos? You'd best tell YouTube. It doesn't mean downloading files? What the hell have I been doing with my email all this time? It doesn't mean playing games? What on earth have people been doing in Farmville all this time? Seriously, this is an attempt to redefine commonly understood ways in a manner that would leave the history-rewriting characters in 1984 looking at each other and raising their eyebrows appreciatively. It seems that what T-Mobile is trying to say is that it's setting a fair use limit. But the second part - \"you'll always be able to browse\" and the third - \"it's only when you go over the fair use amount that you won't be able to download, stream and watch video clips\" - that it becomes absurd. So YouTube will stop working? A site like The Guardian, which has a mixture of video and audio and text and Flash ads and all sorts on its front page - will that work, or not? (Yes, we do intend to follow this up on Wednesday with T-Mobile, but it's the sort of thing that should have been clarified by whoever was overseeing the drafting of this post.) \"So what's changing? - From 1st February 2011 we will be aligning our fair use policies so our mobile internet service will have fair use of 500MB.\" In some cases, the previous value was 3GB. This compares to...oh, there wasn't a specific value given before: \"For Internet on your phone, the Fair Use Policy varies according to tariff. Your terms and conditions will state what it is.\" \"What does this mean? - We'll always let you email and browse the internet and you'll never pay more than you agree to. We do have a fair use policy but ours is there to make sure we deliver the best service possible to all our customers. This means that you'll always be able to browse the internet.\" Where \"browse\" has taken on an entirely new meaning so that it should really be Browse\u2122. \"So remember our Mobile Broadband and internet on your phone service is best used for browsing which means looking at your favorite websites like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, BBC News and more, checking your email and looking for information, but not watching videos or downloading files. \" Wait - Facebook, the site with all the photos that download onto your phone? Gmail, where all my documents that I read come to? BBC News, which has a few videos? And what the hell is this not watching videos or downloading files? Basically, you want to take us back to the text-only web? To Lynx? \"If you want to download, stream and watch video clips, save that stuff for your home broadband.\" Nice - the sort of jolly offhanded remark that has people reaching for their contract renewal date and calling up alternative network tariffs with a \"hey, and save your breath trying to get me to sign up again\" sort of smile. Notably, 3 has recently said it will offer all-you-can-eat service. I wonder if many T-Mobile users will head over there. Not surprisingly, the T-Mobile forums are alight on this one. Here's one asking \"what's the difference between browsing and downloading?\" Oh - update: Which? suspects that T-Mobile has breached the contract. Users do too - it hasn't given 30 days' notice. Stay tuned for more tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
