Starting 7-4 second favourite, Perchancer failed to fully respond to his rider's strong urging on the run-in and went down by a length and a half to the 4-6 shot Byron Lamb. McCoy, who needs six to beat Sir Gordon Richards' record of 269 winners in a season, travels to Hereford today for two rides - Roxby Explorer (3.10) and Admiral Peary (4.40)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
