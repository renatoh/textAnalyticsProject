Brendan Rodgers has been seeking to increase competition on Jos\u00e9 Enrique at left-back all summer and stepped up interest in Cissokho after Granada inflated their asking price for Guilherme Siqueira. The former Lyon and Porto defender, who has been capped once by France, has agreed a season-long loan \u2013 subject to the completion of paperwork \u2013 with a view to a \u00a35m transfer next summer. \"I feel extremely proud to be here and I'm proud of all the hard work I've put in so far throughout my career,\" said the 25-year-old. \"I've always dreamt of one day signing for a really legendary club. I've been lucky enough to play for a few top sides and so to now get the chance to play for a club like Liverpool, it's just fantastic.\" Cissokho's arrival has been tempered by the injury to Coates, who Liverpool are prepared to sell only two years after his \u00a37m arrival from Nacional. The Uruguayan, who has been linked with Fulham this summer, is awaiting scan results on a knee injury suffered in training. A cruciate ligament problem has not been ruled out. Baines/Fellaini to Manchester United Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines may have to lodge transfer requests with Everton if they want to move to Manchester United. Yet with David Moyes reluctant to increase his valuation of Baines beyond \u00a312m and the left-back not minded to agitate to leave, United may face disappointment regarding signing him. Fellaini is considered the more likely acquisition but as Moyes is now seemingly aware of the sensitivities of returning to his former club to buy one of their key players, he may wait to see if the 25-year-old decides to force the issue himself. Last week United had a joint \u00a328m offer angrily rejected by Everton as the sum was considered \"derisory\". Everton had inserted a release clause, now expired, into Fellaini's contract of \u00a323.5m and United's valuation of \u00a316m meant Moyes did not consider the player's value to have increased despite five years in the Premier League and 42 caps for Belgium. There was further disquiet over the \u00a312m price for Baines, the same fee Everton had rejected earlier this summer. Mavrias to Sunderland Paolo Di Canio is poised to make his 11th signing of the summer for Sunderland with the capture of the Panathinaikos teenager Charis Mavrias. Sunderland are believed to have agreed a \u00a32.5m fee for the 19-year-old Greece international who has two caps. It would appear to be third time lucky for Di Canio, who failed with a move to lure Mavrias last month, while hopes of a loan deal fell through last week. Elmander to Norwich Johan Elmander is close to joining Norwich from Galatasaray, according to the Turkish club. Elmander, 32, cannot count on regular first-team action with the Turkish club and will instead attempt to earn a place in Chris Hughton's attack. Galatasaray's technical director Bulent Tulun told the website sportexpressen.se: \"I can confirm Johan is moving to England. We have agreed with Johan, his new club Norwich and his agent.\" Pab\u00f3n to Valencia Valencia have paid the buy-out clause to secure the services of the Colombia striker Dorlan Pab\u00f3n from Monterrey, though the Mexican club are disputing the details of the deal. The 25-year-old forward, who played part of last season on loan with Real Betis, will come in to help fill the gap left by the sale of Roberto Soldado to Tottenham. \"Pab\u00f3n will be a Valencia player as we have deposited his buy-out clause of $10m,\" the Valencia president Amadeo Salvo said. \"In his contract, it literally says if a club pays $10m, they will let him go. Now they say the $10m was a net figure but it doesn't state this anywhere. We will take it to Fifa if necessary and they will rule in our favour. That would be inconvenient as it would string the process out for another two or three weeks.\" Verratti to PSG The Italy midfielder Marco Verratti has signed a one-year contract extension with Paris Saint-Germain that will keep him at the club until 2018. According to media reports, the 20-year-old's salary will rise from \u00a4800,000 to \u00a42m a year. Verratti joined PSG a year ago for a fee of \u20ac11m after helping Pescara win promotion to Serie A. The skilful midfielder, dubbed the \"new Andrea Pirlo\" by some in his home country, made his international debut in February and has four caps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
