Stratou ticks the boxes \u2013 she comes from Greece, from a wealthy background, and studied at Central St Martin\u2019s School of Art around the same time that Jarvis Cocker was there. So is it Stratou, or is it an urban myth? Who cares? At best it\u2019s a Trivial Pursuit question. In all the important ways, it\u2019s irrelevant. First, respect to Cocker and Pulp for declining to name the student for the past two decades. How many of us would relish having our youthful alcohol-sodden guff coming back to haunt us? An over-romanticised empathy with \u201cpoor folk\u201d has long been the default setting of wealthy students, and most of them soon grow out of it. Others don\u2019t even bother. For all her misguided blather, the student could at least be commended for trying to look outside her gilded world. However, there is a wider issue here of \u2013 if you\u2019ll forgive me \u2013 cultural focus. Common People is not a song about a spoiled condescending female, however vivid the character. The song \u2013 part poem, part manifesto \u2013 is about Cocker (back then) and people like Cocker (as he had been): the long-term disfranchised and perma-skint, who spend their lives feeling broke, scared and hopeless, without a safety net. It\u2019s about the scathing wit that gives them voice, and the wild anger that drives them. Crucially, it\u2019s a story about a penniless working-class student rather than a rich slumming one, and in an increasingly polarised one-note cultural landscape, this sort of distinction seems ever more important. It\u2019s now widely accepted that, not just music but all branches of the arts are steadily becoming middle-class enclaves \u2013 affordable only to the privileged few. Which just never used to be the case. Some out there might not like the idea of the musicians of the past honing their craft on the dole and making scant effort to find a \u201creal job\u201d, the fact remains that that\u2019s where a lot of great music came from. Now these same creative types are doubtless being burned out on zero-hours\u2019 contracts. And this is just one way that musicians, like actors, dancers, artists, writers and any other creative person, are being priced out \u2013 and subsequently hounded out \u2013 of the arts. This is a disaster for everybody, including, paradoxically, the privileged few, who lose out on the kind of potent vibrant culture that\u2019s only possible when everybody gets a fair crack at joining in. Instead it becomes the norm that cultural focus goes automatically to a certain brand of middle-class moneyed sensibility, as if this were the only type that matters or, worse still, exists. The problem is that this can\u2019t help but become one-dimensional and stifling. How could it not, when all art has to be viewed through one incredibly narrow filter before it\u2019s deemed worthy of attention, never mind celebration? Moreover, with this kind of constriction, it\u2019s not just talent that\u2019s lost, a tragedy in itself; it\u2019s also different kinds of people, backgrounds, textures, viewpoints and stories. Which is where Common People comes in. This is a song that belongs without question to the disempowered classes. It\u2019s the narrator (Cocker) who counts, and how he wants to tell his story. It barely matters who the student is \u2013 she\u2019s a mere cipher, and that\u2019s how \u201cshe\u201d should remain, now more than ever. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care if the student was Stratou or some other. Increasingly, all we hear about (and from) are people like that, usually strumming on a guitar wailing about \u201cfinding themselves\u201d on a beach in Goa. Common People is about hearing from someone like the young Jarvis Cocker, the sort now seldom heard \u2013 someone sardonic, angry and \u2013 above all \u2013 totally skint. Jeremy, wait. This move could be a total car crash Former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are rumoured to have been offered a deal to re-form for ITV. Well, it had to happen \u2013 a globally successful trio and the opportunity to grab the entire \u201cbrum brum\u201d dream team intact. All going well, the guys could be back, filling petrol tanks, flicking each other with wet towels and making \u201chilarious\u201d xenophobic jokes before you could say: \u201cIs the kitchen still open?\u201d Still, Clarkson and the gang should be wary of Des Lynam syndrome. Lynam was considered the Beeb\u2019s sports jewel in the crown, but the magic didn\u2019t travel well to ITV. See also Adrian Chiles, and Morecambe and Wise. Weirdly, it\u2019s as if certain entities only seem to work in the context of the BBC, even if all the major players are involved. Perhaps ITV has learned the lessons of the past, and the move would be a great success. However, everyone should be aware, should the deal go ahead, that replicating the success that Top Gear enjoyed at the BBC (and without the name, which is owned by the Beeb) is not necessarily a done deal. Even if Clarkson can control his temper over his poor hungry tummy. Perhaps Tinder doth protest too much Please bear with me while, not for the first time, I fall to my knees, hands clasped together, and give thanks that I wasn\u2019t single and looking for love in the time of Tinder. What must it be like to be judged and found wanting with a single nonchalant swipe? At least when I was young, people put a bit of an effort into their soulless sexual objectification. Now it seems that dating app Tinder has come down with swipe-anxiety, or at least gone a bit shy. It\u2019s taken umbrage at a GlobalWebIndex study that says that it has a large number (42%) of married or attached people using their app to have affairs. Fancy. However, Tinder says that the study is too small to be accurate, and the bulk of the users are too young a demographic to be married. Also that Tinder is a social network and not only for arranging sexual encounters. Well, sorry your majesty! In truth, the average age of users doesn\u2019t mean Jack \u2013 even the young can be partnered up. Besides, by definition, people who have affairs are fairly adept at lying, and this could conceivably include their age. Just saying. As for the focus not being on sexual encounters, I\u2019m genuinely confused. I would have thought that Tinder was as much a signifier of this as pots of pampas grass were for swingers. I thought that this was what people actively liked about Tinder: it would seem that I\u2019m completely wrong. Or perhaps it\u2019s Tinder that could be mistaken. Surely it knows what it is, just as everyone else knows what it is, and generally it isn\u2019t where people arrange to meet up for a cup of tea with their lovely new friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
