He told the Radio Times that dedicated funding \u201csays to the post-Windrush group that if they choose this employment, there\u2019s a chance ... BAME kids get discouraged \u2013 too many glass ceilings to break through\u201d. Henry has become a leading figure in the movement to increase diversity in the TV industry following his Bafta speech last year in which he lambasted the industry\u2019s lack of progress and put forward the ring-fencing proposal. Broadcasters have been praised for backing efforts such as Project Diamond \u2013 which aims to monitor diversity in the industry \u2013 but have come under fire for not putting enough financial backing behind attempts to increase BME representation on screen and in production. The Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thomson, who along with Henry is part of the BBC\u2019s diversity action group led by the director general, Tony Hall,, said in June that the corporation could have to spend as much as \u00a3100m to more accurately reflect its audience. Henry said that improving diversity is not just about getting \u201canother black or Asian person in Coronation Street or EastEnders.\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s about hearing different perspectives on life. Commissioning editors do tend to say, \u2018Mmm, have we already heard your story?\u2019 as if there was only one story from each ethnic group.\u201d Henry also told the magazine that his late mother would have been delighted by his recent knighthood, awarded for services to charity and comedy. He said: \u201cShe\u2019d have come [to the investiture] and worn a very, very big hat and hardly have believed it of the boy who couldn\u2019t tidy his room and was difficult at school.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
