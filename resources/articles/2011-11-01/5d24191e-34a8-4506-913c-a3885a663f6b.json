How much of what you do do you feel is worthwhile? Are you satisfied with life? Since April, official statisticians have been asking these questions of 200,000 households as part of a monthly survey. No, not an example of the encroaching nanny state \u2013 unless, that is, you can't help spotting nannies \u2013 but an intriguing experiment in public policymaking. As well as measuring inflation and milk output and (yesterday's indicator du jour) gross domestic product, the Office for National Statistics now wants to gauge Britons' wellbeing. Credit David Cameron and his talk of increasing general wellbeing; credit the greens for arguing that there must be more to running an economy than simply producing ever more stuff \u2013 or blame the financial crisis for proving yet again that not all economic activity is worthwhile. Whoever kicked it, the ball is certainly moving. This week the ONS's efforts moved up a gear with a consultation into what exactly to measure. Should statisticians look at people's fear of crime? The quality of their local environment? Even (gulp) their trust in MPs? Writers on happiness can sometimes produce bland soup \u2013 but surveys of wellbeing are potentially fascinating. Not so long ago, researchers surveyed ordinary Palestinians. What they really wanted, it turned out, was not revenge, or statehood \u2013 but security, to go about their daily lives. Imagine how different Middle Eastern diplomacy would be if it took security, rather than politics, as its primary goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
