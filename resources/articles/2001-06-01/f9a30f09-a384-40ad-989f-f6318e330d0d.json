The offer, which is a one-off cash payment, is likely to prompt a flurry of approaches from other Premiership clubs including Arsenal, Sunderland and Tottenham. Jeffers favours Arsenal, although the Gunners would prefer to pay in instalments - a method that would be less attractive to Everton given their parlous finances. The 20-year-old, in the final year of his Everton contract, was put up for sale by Walter Smith last month after rejecting the final offer of a new deal which would have doubled his wages to \u00a320,000 a week. Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson is willing to spend a large slice of his summer transfer budget of \u00a314m on a striker who has started only 37 Premiership games and missed most of last season with knee and shoulder injuries. But, with Robson's attempts to recruit Michael Bridges from Leeds likely to be thwarted, Jeffers is seen as the ideal foil for Carl Cort or Alan Shearer. Everton may in turn sign the unsettled Rangers defender Lorenzo Amoruso. Smith brought the Italian to Ibrox in 1997 and intends to buy an experienced defender after Richard Gough's retirement. \"Everton are a possibility for Lorenzo,\" admitted Amoruso's agent Andrea d'Amico. \"It is an attractive option because he knows Walter Smith well. But there are a lot of other interested parties and he has not ruled out the possibility of staying in Scotland.\" Tottenham's hopes of signing Liverpool's unsettled Germany defender Christian Ziege have been raised with the player denying reports that he wanted a move to Bayern Munich. Spurs have been chasing the 29-year-old wing-back since he fell out with Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier over his lack of first-team chances. But their hopes appeared to receive a setback when Ziege was reported as saying: \"I'd be lying if I said it was not my aim to rejoin Bayern.\" However, he denied that yesterday. \"All I said was that I would recommend any player to accept an offer from Bayern.\" The Spurs manager Glenn Hoddle will increase his interest as he rebuilds the Tottenham team, with some reports suggesting he is close to a deal. Ipswich have confirmed the signing of Spain's Under-21 striker Pablo Gonzalez Counago from Celta Vigo on a free transfer. The player, who has signed a four-year deal, scored twice in February's Under-21 game with England. Millwall's striker Neil Harris is awaiting the results of tests after undergoing surgery for testicular cancer on Friday. His manager Mark McGhee said of the 23-year-old's illness: \"The fact it has been detected and dealt with so quickly is a blessing. We now hope the results of his tests will prove positive - and the early signs are good.\" Southampton's Rupert Lowe has dismissed reports linking Preston's David Moyes with the managerial vacancy at the Dell as \"completely unfounded\". Saints have not ruled out appointing a foreigner. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
