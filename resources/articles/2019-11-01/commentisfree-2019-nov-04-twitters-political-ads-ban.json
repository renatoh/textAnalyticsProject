The ban encompasses paid tweets from candidates as well as \u201cpolitical issues\u201d ads. The announcement received widespread applause, in particular from leading Democratic figures, but far less enthusiasm from those who create, run or research political advertising. Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads is unnecessarily severe and simplistic, disadvantages challengers, and is likely unenforceable \u2013 but it was a great PR move for the company, for now. As others have pointed out, there is lots of room for nuanced digital ad policy between Facebook\u2019s \u201ceverything goes\u201d model and Twitter\u2019s blackout. But Twitter\u2019s new policy is simplistic and likely will have unintended effects. After Dorsey tweeted the new policy, the Trump campaign released a statement decrying the move, pointing to the ban as more \u201cevidence\u201d for supposed anti-conservative bias. But the last person who needs Twitter ads is Trump. My research indicates that upwards of 80% of Trump tweets end up in news stories, earning him massive amounts of media exposure. The move by Twitter all but ensures a repeat of 2016, when Trump\u2019s Twitter tactics helped gain his campaign an estimated $2bn of earned media coverage. Moving beyond Trump and the US presidential election, Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads disadvantages challengers and political newcomers. Digital ads are much cheaper than television ads, drawing in a wider scope of candidates, especially for down-ballot races. Though much of the public debate about digital ads focuses on hyped-up fears of nefarious persuasion, many more digital ads are used as an organizational tool. Challenger campaigns use low-cost digital ads to build lists of supporters, solicit donations and mobilize volunteers. Digital ads also allow political newcomers to introduce themselves \u2013 a tactic that often only breaks through with paid promotion. As a smaller platform, Twitter brings in far less revenue in political ads than, say, Facebook. According to Twitter\u2019s CFO ,Ned Segal, the company brought in less than $3m from political ads during the 2018 US midterms. But Twitter offers political newcomers the ability to communicate to a crucial population: journalists and political elites. From Twitter, journalists infer what is newsworthy and tweets that get high engagement on the platform can lead to news coverage. Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads will make it harder for challengers and newcomers to break into the news cycle. A move to ban political ads still puts Twitter in the position of arbitrating political speech, as it must decide what is \u2013 and what is not \u2013 political. Identifying candidate ads is relatively straightforward, but identifying political issue ads is anything but. Though the full policy won\u2019t be public until 15 November, Twitter\u2019s policy and legal lead, Vijaya Gadde, offered a working definition: \u201cAds that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes).\u201d These broad categories are open to vast interpretive flexibility. And like Facebook and Google, Twitter has struggled to categorize ads and arbitrate their content at scale. Perhaps even more important is, from what perspective(s) will \u201cpolitical issues\u201d be defined? Advocating a certain healthcare policy may be political, but what about advertising locations of healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood? Can they advertise about breast exams? Birth control? Abortions? The broad category of \u201chealthcare\u201d gets fuzzy fast. Of course, defining anything as not political tends to come from a privileged point of view. With the end of political ads, does that mean the end of the Twitter ad archive? The archive had problems, to be sure, but it did provide a measure of transparency. With a ban policy in place, Twitter should continue to embrace transparency and implement some method for showcasing what ads are rejected for being deemed political. Furthermore, Twitter should establish clear and specified mechanisms to contest these decisions. My research, with Daniel Kreiss, suggests that tech firms\u2019 vagaries around political ad guidelines, decisions and processes leave political users frustrated and leaves tech firms open to charges of conservative bias. From a PR perspective, though, Twitter\u2019s announcement was a slam dunk. The policy announcement via subtweet \u2013 itself pre-emptive and without details \u2013 took advantage of the negative focus on Facebook\u2019s everything-is-welcome perspective. Twitter backed Facebook into a moral corner, all to applause from the likes of AOC and HRC. But the messy work of defining political issue ads still makes Twitter an arbiter of political speech \u2013 a job they\u2019re not likely to perform well. For those worried about the impact of digital political advertising on the health of democracies, a far better focus than the content of and the presence of the ads is the means by which they are targeted.
