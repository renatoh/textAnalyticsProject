Last week\u2019s Observer had three articles that reveal the symptoms of a system in freefall: \u00a350m for grammar schools (\u201cThis zombie grammar school policy will only harm crisis-hit schools\u201d, Focus); corruption in academy trusts (\u201cAcademy trust in spotlight again over spending\u201d, News); and the teacher shortage (\u201cBurnout\u201d, special report). In the 15 years since I last lived and taught here, billions have been spent remaking education and this is where you have landed: \u2022 stress levels so high that the number of primary school children seeking mental health help has gone up by a third in a year; \u2022 teacher shortages at secondary level contributing to the vicious circle of larger classes; \u2022 academies operating with deficits resulting in layoffs; \u2022 a two-tier system where parents can work the odds to get their children into the \u201cgood\u201d schools; \u2022 a system of accountability that has led to perverse outcomes, including teaching to the test, excluding children with special educational needs and disabilities and teacher burnout. And you still don\u2019t do well on international comparison tests. I have spent the last few months researching what has happened to British education in the last decade or two. I have used it as an example of what not to do in Canadian schools, where we enjoy remarkably good results on international tests. Here\u2019s my advice: chill. Get rid of targets, standardised tests, Ofsted, selective schools, exclusion, league tables, baseline assessments and truancy officers. Focus on happiness: let teachers do what they know best \u2013 enriching children\u2019s lives with real learning experiences and paying attention to their whole development. Remove the stress and allow the true joy of teaching and learning back into your schools. Molly Hurd Oxford As a newly qualified teacher reaching the end of my first year, I must say that your article on teacher burnout does nothing to help teacher uptake and only serves to create scaremongering. I am completing my master\u2019s in education research, while working full time, and I feel that my school supports me in every way. Funding will always be an issue in the public sector \u2013 this shouldn\u2019t be used as a reason to put teachers off. If you look at the statistics on teacher \u201cburnout\u201d or those who have chosen to leave the profession over the last 40 years, you can see that the numbers do not really stand out in recent years. I think it is hugely damaging to teacher uptake to publish these, quite frankly, terrifying case studies with no balance of teachers who are incredibly happy and fulfilled. I think some people decide to teach based on their own memories of what it was like to be at school rather than approaching it as you would any other career. There are a few problems with the beginning of a teacher\u2019s career and many teachers are too young to realise that. You must find a school you will be happy in. This is key. When I was applying for jobs, I was one of the last in my year to secure one because I did not want to work anywhere. It had to be somewhere that would offer me support and had an ethos in line with my own. This is the same as any other time I have applied for jobs and something I think many people forget when they are initially applying for jobs... it pays to be picky in teaching! My workload is manageable and I always have time to do what I want outside school. In my year group, we share the planning and there are always people I can go to for support or to observe. As I mentioned previously I am also completing my Masters which has been a wonder of discovery and will open up further career options for me. I don\u2019t find it unmanageable. I love what I do. I love my colleagues, the children and the community I am part of. Jasmine Stedman Avenue Junior School,Norwich Don\u2019t stop the music In response to the letter and article about the lack of music in schools (\u201cTop musicians unite in call for all pupils to have the right to learn an instrument\u201d, News), in East Sussex there was/is a great music service taking lessons into schools. Many of these are subsidised for parents on a lower income, with a Saturday school of orchestras, bands and choirs that helps children enjoy and perform music. This service has received an outstanding grade from Ofsted and yet East Sussex county council is closing it down. Hundreds of teachers will lose their jobs and around 7,000 children will lose their lessons, their skills and their chance to perform. The music service is 99% self-sustaining. Once this service is gone it will never be replaced and many children for whom music was a lifeline in troubled times as well as a great skill to take into further education and life will have this proved benefit taken from them. They are voteless and voiceless. Jonquil Cargill Hastings, East Sussex The immigration conundrum Nick Cohen is right that those who oppose a hard Brexit need to say what they would do about immigration (\u201cWe recognise the grievances of the left behind. But we have no solutions\u201d, Comment). Central to this has to be the acceptance of the crashingly obvious \u2013 that most people want stricter controls over immigration. This could be achieved in a progressive manner if the goal were one of minimising \u201cnew, large-scale, permanent migration\u201d. What makes this approach progressive is that \u201cnew\u201d makes it clear that curbing immigration involves no changes for those already legally resident, such as the Windrush generation and those from the EU. \u201cPermanent\u201d has the caveat that foreign students are welcome to study here and that workers fill vacancies here, but only for a specified period. Crucially, the recipient countries must rapidly train enough doctors and nurses, for example, from their own population to prevent the shameful theft of such vital staff from the poorer countries that originally paid for their education. Given there is bound to be the need for some exceptional academics and wealth generators, as well as genuine marriage or civil partners or reunited family members to settle permanently, then their numbers might be roughly in balance with the numbers of people emigrating. Colin Hines East Twickenham Tactics to defeat terror With just two days to go until the anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack, which also marks the murder five years ago of Fusilier Lee Rigby, we would like to ask the public, as well as honouring those we have lost, to think about how you can become part of the solution to terror. We are a group of survivors of terrorism. Some of us were injured, others have lost loved ones. In all cases, the scars of those moments are deep. As we know from our experiences, terrorists have targeted the innocent regardless of faith, ethnicity or politics for generations. Our members have lost loved ones to nationalists, Islamists and far-right extremists. What binds these extremists is not any particular belief. It is the hatred of people not like them and the willingness to use violence against innocent civilians. It is this that we must take on and defeat. When terror hits, we all feel an impotent rage. We all want to help the victims and take on the evil that drives the attacks, but how? Here are five things we\u2019d ask you to consider: \u2022 Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed. Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don\u2019t deserve to be remembered. \u2022 Give to appeals to help the victims of attacks and demand government provide the high-quality services that survivors need. \u2022 Ask media and social media organisations to do far more to shut down those driving hate. \u2022 Support our emergency and security services to do their job. If you know something or suspect something, tell them. \u2022 Take on hatred wherever you find it. Very few of us will ever meet a terrorist, but lots of us will experience those driving hatred. Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in; if we take on that hatred, we dry up that sea. There is no easy fix to terrorism, but we do know that if we all play our part we can make it less likely and ensure no other family has to go through what we have.
