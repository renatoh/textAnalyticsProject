The local authority pension fund forum, which is made up of 24 pension funds with total assets of more than \u00a340bn, described the new Boots scheme, which can provide share awards equal to 200% of salary, as both unchallenging and \"simply unacceptable\". The scheme is being put before shareholders of the Boots, Halfords and healthcare group at next week's annual meeting. According to the forum, the share option awards will be exercisable if earnings per share grow by 3% a year for three years. The scheme is on top of a long-term incentive plan, which already awards shares worth up to 125% of salary. Councillor Bob Sowman, chairman of the forum and of the \u00a35bn West Yorkshire pension fund, said: \"Growth of 3% per annum is hardly an ambitious target. We want to see companies setting stretching performance targets which only reward executives for superior performance. This sort of scheme is sending the wrong signals to executives and is simply unacceptable. Shareholders should vote no.\" A spokesman for Boots said the forum had misunderstood the new scheme. \"They have got so many things wrong.\" He said the 3% target was actually RPI +3% and that, although the Boots group wants permission to award share options up to 200% of salary, no individual working for the company would receive more than more than 100%. The spokesman said the board was seeking permission for 200% awards \"only because there may be exceptional circumstances\". He said independent consultants calculated that the maximum payout would be about 55%. Share options only gave executives the benefit of the rise in share price rather than just free shares. He added: \"The reason we have introduced this scheme is because Towers Perrin [remuneration consultants] have done a review of our executive compensation and have said that to be in line with the market we need to introduce this scheme.\" Boots said the forum had not consulted the company before advising its members to vote against the scheme. The retailer was now contacting the forum to urge the shareholders to reconsider."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
