With Van Gaal he got a total education", "bodyText": "Shortly before the 2010 Champions League final between Internazionale and Bayern Munich, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho sent his opposite number, Louis van Gaal, a text message that read: \u201cA big hug before the final a big hug after the final.\u201d Yes, that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Well, it\u2019s better than a poke in the eye. That match at the Bernab\u00e9u was the only previous time Mourinho and Van Gaal have met on opposite sides in a competitive match, as they will again when Manchester United play Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. It is a fixture that has for nine of the past 10 seasons been cast as a collision of title hopefuls but that this season is, from a certain angle, just as significant as a meeting of two unusually intimate managerial grandees. There is of course a famous coaching confluence at work here, a re-entwining of two of the most significant offshoots of European football\u2019s own mid-1990s Bloomsbury set. The Van Gaal era at Barcelona also featured Mourinho as assistant coach, Pep Guardiola as club captain and the managers of Bar\u00e7a, PSV Eindhoven and Ajax \u2013 Luis Enrique, Phillip Cocu and Frank de Boer \u2013 as fellow members of the playing staff. This kind of clustered progression is a common enough phenomenon, not least where a team has been built around a galvanising philosophy. Barcelona continue to burp out managers, and no doubt 10 years from now elite level European football will be directed by the post-Pep brigade: Generation Lahm, the Busquets Set. What is unusual is the degree of enduring affection that still exists between Van Gaal and Mourinho almost 15 years on from the end of their three-year working relationship, a period when Mourinho was granted an unplanned but gloriously lucid coaching apprenticeship. \u201cHe was a little bit arrogant, not always a respecter of reputations,\u201d Van Gaal has said of those early days at Barcelona. \u201cI sometimes think I was the only guy who believed in Jos\u00e9,\u201d United\u2019s manager suggested in Patrick Barclay\u2019s excellent book Mourinho. \u201cHe was known as El Traductor [the Translator] \u2026 I took him more seriously than most people in the club.\u201d Certainly there is a case to be made that the guarded but still tangible sense of affection between the two has something to do with that degree of professional distance. \u201cWe were never in the same league,\u201d Mourinho said during his pre-match press conference at Cobham. \u201cIn the Champions League you depend on draws and it happened only once. But that\u2019s not important. What is important is [Sunday]. I don\u2019t play against Louis. Chelsea plays Manchester United and during the match I have no time and for sure he has no time to look around and to see who the opponent\u2019s manager is. Before the match and after the match he is one of my big friends in football and I will be always happy to see him.\u201d For a man whose later interactions with Barcelona have often been troubled, Mourinho remains unequivocal about his time with Van Gaal in Catalonia, a period in which he was initially angry at Bobby Robson being shunting aside but persuaded to stay by Van Gaal and promoted thereafter from Mr Fix-it to analyst, assistant coach and \u2013 for the odd friendly \u2013 de facto first\u2011team manager. \u201cTo be working four years, one with Mr Robson and three with Louis in a club like Barcelona was very important,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIf I have to choose important people in my career for sure he\u2019s one of them. I never hid the fact he is my friend and the respect I have for him.\u201d It is hard to overstate this professional influence: in a sense Van Gaal made Mourinho. Certainly he was the first to give his near neighbour \u2013 they lived in the same building and would often share meals, family birthdays and late night tactical chats \u2013 any real coaching experience. Under Robson, Mourinho had been a high-grade gopher. Under Van Gaal he received a total education in systems and structures, becoming in a sense another successful Van Gaal hunch, a punt on youth, in his own time a kind of back-room Tyler Blackett. Not that Mourinho was in the mood to expand on his debt to Van Gaal. Naturally enough his thoughts are more closelyoccupied with the fitness of his forwards, with Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my out for two or three weeks and Diego Costa struggling to start at Old Trafford after a week that saw his familiar hamstring struggles compounded by a trip to hospital with a gastric virus. Mourinho still has some hope Costa will play ahead of Didier Drogba, who looked ponderous against Maribor in midweek. Without Costa, Sunday\u2019s match resembles, from a certain angle, a meeting of two halves of a pantomime horse: the team with no strikers against the team without a defence. Van Gaal may have inherited a decomposing cadaver of a champion team, his bits and pieces midfield and defence thrown into alarming relief by Chelsea\u2019s well-calibrated spine. But United do have a point of strength at centre-forward: Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney trump Costa, R\u00e9my and Drogba, while in \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda United have one creative midfielder to match anything in Chelsea\u2019s own battery. The Argentinian is of course a player Mourinho also knows well from his second spell in Spain. \u201cIf I bought Di Mar\u00eda it was because I liked him,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIf he was fantastic in my period at Real Madrid, good. Now he is at Manchester, a little like Louis there are fantastic memories but over 90 minutes he wants to win and I want to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
