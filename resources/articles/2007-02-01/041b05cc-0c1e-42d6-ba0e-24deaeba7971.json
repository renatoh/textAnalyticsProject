Manchester City's manager has been under the spotlight after three successive Premiership defeats and his contentious decision to take over the England Under-21 position but this was a result to ease any pressure. City fully deserved this derby victory to secure a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Preston, sixth in the Championship, had been expected to provide a severe test but it was City who posed most of the questions. Not even an early concession, when David Nugent enhanced his reputation with a predatory goal in the seventh minute, unsettled City. The visitors responded positively and, though two of their goals were scored late on, Preston could have few complaints about the outcome. Paul Simpson's side did, however, rue their failure to score a second goal when Michael Ricketts burst through in the 24th minute. Preston were already leading at the time and had Ricketts, one on one with Nicky Weaver, steered his shot either side of the goalkeeper, the task might have been beyond City. Instead Weaver saved and City achieved parity 11 minutes later when Michael Ball marked his second game for the club with a wonderful goal. The equaliser was reward for a period of sustained pressure, even if there had been little goal threat. That aspect of their play must remain a genuine concern for Pearce, despite the parts Bernardo Corradi and Georgios Samaras played in all three of their side's goals. Both have endured difficult seasons and few City fans will be getting carried away with their contribution against a Preston side who conceded too much time and space in the area. That weakness was exploited by Samaras with five minutes remaining, when he turned Ball's long throw-in towards goal. Matty Hill, attempting to clear, succeeded only in diverting the ball into the net with his chest. Preston's resistance had been broken and, with the home side throwing numbers forward in desperate search for an equaliser, Pearce's side struck on the counter-attack to snatch a third goal with Stephen Ireland's brilliantly executed 20-yard volley. The final scoreline might have been slightly flattering in terms of City's attempts on goal, although their territorial advantage and control of possession merited this much needed win. Preston probed in midfield, with Paul McKenna using the ball intelligently to switch play, but there was little penetration after the loss of Ricketts, taken to hospital with a suspected dislocated shoulder after he fell awkwardly shortly before the interval. Preston were as good as nullified as an attacking force thereafter, with Nugent's off-target header on the stroke of half-time their last noteworthy opportunity. The first had arrived after City dominated the early moments, forcing several corners only to succumb to a set piece at their own end. Danny Pugh's corner was met by the head of Ricketts and, although Weaver saved superbly, Nugent forced in the rebound for his 14th goal of the season. It was a sight Pearce would enjoy when he oversees England's challenge in the European Under-21 Championship in the summer but this was a moment to endure. The City manager admitted he would have taken a draw beforehand and Preston's early goal can only have reinforced his concerns. City were far from subdued, though, and 10 minutes before the interval Ball, signed from PSV last month, speared a 12-yard shot in off an upright after Corradi's shot had hit the same post. The complexion of the tie had changed and City sensed victory. Twice Hatem Trabelsi came close to grabbing a second before Samaras caused consternation in the Preston area, leading to Hill's own goal. Ireland's effort provided a more lasting memory, the midfielder thundering a low volley from just outside the area past Andy Lonergan to end Preston's hopes of reaching the sixth-round for the first time since 1966. Man of the match: Stephen Ireland More renowned for his passing ability than his scoring prowess, Ireland showed both qualities here. He helped City control possession for long periods. Best moment The technique displayed to steer a 20-yard shot past Andy Lonergan in the 90th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
