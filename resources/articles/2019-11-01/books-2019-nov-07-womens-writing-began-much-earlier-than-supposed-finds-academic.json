Or her contemporary, a nun who was the first woman to write a full-length prose work in English and hid her name in the text. A new history of women\u2019s writing argues that there was a thriving female literature far earlier than previously believed, and that earlier histories have deliberately excluded or marginalised the contributions of early medieval women. The first English women\u2019s writing is usually dated to the later middle ages, to the likes of the 12th-century courtly writer Marie de France and 14th-century visionaries Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe. Published next month, Diane Watt\u2019s Women, Writing and Religion in England and Beyond, 650\u20131100 argues that women were at the heart of the emerging English literary tradition much earlier. Watt, a professor at the University of Surrey, lays out in the book how some anonymous texts from the period were probably created by women, and contends that men rewrote works originally produced by women. \u201cThere was a vibrant literary culture that women were involved in, in a whole range of ways, before the Norman conquest. There\u2019s a big Latin tradition preceding that which isn\u2019t considered, partly because it\u2019s in Latin and partly because the picture hasn\u2019t been put together,\u201d said Watt. \u201cPeople might notice isolated cases of women\u2019s writing, but the evidence hasn\u2019t been put together.\u201d Her book brings a host of early female writers together, including Leoba, an English missionary and abbess of Tauberbischofsheim in Franconia who died in 782; and Hugeburc, an English nun who joined the Benedictine monastery of Heidenheim. Leoba\u2019s one surviving letter features the earliest example of poetry by an Englishwoman (\u201cFarewell, and may you live long and happily, making intercession for me,\u201d runs Watt\u2019s translation from the Latin), while Hugeburc wrote an account of the lives of the brothers St Willibald and St Winnebald. Hugeburc is seen as the first named English woman writer of a full-length narrative, with her authorship of the text only discovered in the 20th century, when her name was found to be encrypted in the manuscript. Unencrypted, the Latin reads: \u201cEgo una Saxonica nomine Hugeburc ordinando hec scribebam,\u201d or \u201cI, a Saxon nun named Hugeburc, wrote this\u201d. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a modern translation so it\u2019s not something people could go and read, but a text like that is so important,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd for Leoba, who was a close supporter of St Boniface, her very first letter to him includes lines of verse, which she\u2019s composing in order to impress him. It seems to work because he subsequently invites her to travel to Germany to join the mission. She\u2019s using poetry almost [as a] CV. So we know women were writing poetry back then.\u201d Watt also argues that an anonymous eighth-century Life of Gregory the Great could have been produced by one of the nuns in Whitby\u2019s double monastery, not necessarily by a monk. \u201cThe emphasis on women within the text would seem to reflect the interests of women, which would seem to suggest female authorship,\u201d she said. She also makes the case that monastic writers of the time \u201coverwrote\u201d accounts by women of their own histories. One example, she claims, is Bede, who did not name the authors of the local books he drew upon for his account of the early abbesses of the English church in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. \u201cI\u2019m 99.9% sure that these early sources were written by women, the early communities themselves producing their own histories,\u201d said Watt. \u201cBede came along and took these sources and incorporated them \u2026 It\u2019s not a deliberate censorship, but you have a major writer like Bede coming along, and his becomes the definitive text, and the earlier ones become redundant.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only medieval monks overlooking the work of women. Watt writes that that even recently published studies of literary history continue to give short shrift to women, especially in relation to the pre-modern period. \u201cI think the field of medieval literature is very slow to change, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do in this book is a lot of the groundwork for the texts available, because the texts are in Latin [and] Old English, so you have to have quite specific scholarly skills to access this material.\u201d Watt believes that understanding women writers\u2019 contribution is vital to understanding the period itself. \u201cOur understanding of the period as a whole is diminished by not acknowledging their contributions,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
