One needs no introduction - he's called Jonny Wilkinson - and the other really shouldn't. Wilkinson will be on the bench for Newcastle as they host Sale in this afternoon's Powergen Cup tie. And towards the other end of the country in Reading Josh Lewsey is included among the replacements for Wasps against London Irish and can expect about half an hour after his comeback from a shoulder operation during the summer. Of the two, Lewsey is the one with a more pressing schedule - he has been included in England's squad for the autumn internationals, despite not having appeared yet this season, and he'll want to prove himself ready. Meanwhile, there will be interest in the performance of the man for whom Wilkinson is understudy today. Toby Flood wears the great man's No 10 shirt, given a run-out instead of Dave Walder, and great things are expected of the 20-year-old. Who knows? Soon Newcastle, not to mention England, may be inundated with world-class fly-halfs. Leeds host Llanelli in the other tie. Leeds put out a strong side, and the duel between Justin Marshall and the returning Lion Dwayne Peel will be a major point of interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
