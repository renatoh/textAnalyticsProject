The 21-year-old Reekie has been the sensation of the indoor season, smashing the British 800m, 1500m and mile records since the start of February. But on Saturday she showed another side of her ability, coming from behind to win a tactical race against a high-class 1500m field in Glasgow with a stunning 30.1sec last lap. Afterwards Young was effusive in his praise for his athlete \u2013 and her kick. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many people have that. I\u2019ve not seen, well near enough anyone who\u2019s got that kind of kick. She was probably at the biggest grand prix in the world \u2013 and on her home track \u2013 so to deliver that at the end of a tough two weeks, with a 30-second last lap, you don\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d Young also praised Reekie\u2019s growing tactical acumen, which allowed her to judge her race to perfection before breezing past the world indoor silver medallist, Dawit Seyaum. \u201cShe did it relatively flawlessly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe kept on the inside, moved up when she needed to and had the energy to go, bang. There\u2019s not much wrong with that.\u201d Young insisted he was not surprised that Reekie, who won European under\u201123 middle-distance titles last summer, had made such a breakthrough after sorting out her diet and some health issues, including having a sinus operation in December. \u201cI saw it coming last summer over 800,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now sorted out her gluten intolerance and her sinus infections and had a good block of training. We\u2019ve been working for four years on her technique,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s still not there yet but at least the legs are moving forward in the right direction. It all adds together.\u201d Reekie\u2019s next race will be against a high-quality field in Lievin on Wednesday and she is then likely to skip the British indoor championships next week to start preparations for the summer. Young insisted that Reekie was a genuine Olympic contender over 800m \u2013 having run 1:57 indoors earlier this month, the fastest indoor time in the world since 2006. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got to remember she\u2019s 21 and this will be her first Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if you can deliver that kind of performance and you can navigate heats and semis and get to the final and deliver a performance like that, it\u2019s an exciting opportunity.\u201d On Saturday Reekie denied that her Nike prototype spikes were a factor in her recent improvement, saying it was a result of pushing her body \u201cto the absolute limit\u201d. Meanwhile, Reekie\u2019s training partner, Laura Muir, confirmed that she believes her Nike spikes are legal under recent new regulations set out by World Athletics. However, the debate about shoe technology flared up again on Sunday when the Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei set a 5km road world record wearing a pair of Nike Vaporfly shoes. Cheptegei, who won the world 10,000m title on the track in Doha last October, achieved his latest mark in Monaco in 12min 51sec to beat the previous best by 27 seconds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
