Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s latest events: Perhaps the most significant development of the day was the joint press conference held by the US president, Donald Trump, and the UK prime minister, Theresa May. You can read a comprehensive summary of that here. Within hours, Trump would row back on one of his key claims. He also contradicted himself over comments he made on tape about Meghan Markle. Tory leadership hopefuls took part in their first hustings. Boris Johnson said the party faced an existential crisis over Brexit and, with his hand at the tiller, the UK would be steered out of the EU on 31 October \u2013 with or without a deal. Sajid Javid warned against trying to defeat the Brexit party by becoming it. Two candidates withdrew from the race, while the Tory party made it more difficult for outside bets to stand. Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly both bowed out, having attracted relatively little support. More than half of Change UK\u2019s MPs left the party. Once, they were 11. Now, only five remain. They have vowed to fight on under the leadership of Anna Soubry. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: Trump, who met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage this afternoon, also told the programme he felt it inappropriate to meet the leader of the official opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, who had requested a meeting and who also spoke at a rally protesting the state visit. I don\u2019t know [Corbyn]. He wanted to meet. It was very tough to meet and probably inappropriate to meet to be honest with you. A lot of things are happening right now with respect to our country. Your country, my country \u2013 let\u2019s call them almost the same because I feel that way, it\u2019s really a tremendous relationship. So I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to me him but I would. I certainly would. I have no problem with it. Donald Trump is rowing back on his claim that the NHS was \u201con the table\u201d in post-Brexit deal negotiations. At a joint press conference with Theresa May this afternoon, he said: When you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So, NHS or anything else. A lot more than that. Those comments were met with immediate condemnation from several Tory leadership hopefuls, as well as senior Labour politicians. This evening, ITV News reports that the US president has now told Good Morning Britain: I don\u2019t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Trump\u2019s ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, has previously said the US will want access to the NHS as part of a trade deal. The former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, one of the leading figures in the One Nation group that\u2019s holding tonight\u2019s Tory leadership hustings, has said Boris Johnson was \u201csubdued\u201d and showed his serious side. She said he told MPs that, if Brexit was delayed again, there was a risk the \u201crelevance\u201d of the 2016 referendum result \u201cstarts to wane\u201d. Asked about Johnson\u2019s warning about the future of the party, Morgan said: I think we all know that the stakes are very high. Donald Trump has acknowledged that he referred to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d on the eve of his state visit to the UK \u2013 contradicting his earlier claim he had not done so, which was itself a contradiction of an audio recording of him doing so. The US president made the original comments in an interview with the Sun newspaper; an audio recording of which the paper published. The journalist asked him if he was aware that Meghan had \u201cnot so nice\u201d about him during his election campaign. He replied: \u201cNo, I did not know that she was nasty.\u201d Later, Trump tweeted: Speaking to Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, he said: They said some of the things that she said and It\u2019s actually on tape. And I said: \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t know she was nasty\u2019. I wasn\u2019t referring to \u2018she\u2019s nasty\u2019. I said she was nasty about me. And essentially I didn\u2019t know she was nasty about me. The US president added: \u201cYou know what? She\u2019s doing a good job, I hope she enjoys her life... I think she\u2019s very nice.\u201d Trump said he had spoken to Prince Harry during his visit. \u201cI congratulated him and I think he\u2019s a terrific guy. The royal family is really nice.\u201d He said he had not discussed the issue with Prince Harry. I was going to because it was so falsely put out there. And when you see that transcript and you see, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what they said. Did you look at the transcript? The Tory leadership hopeful, Andrea Leadsom, is understood to have told tonight\u2019s hustings that she has a three-point plan to deliver Brexit \u2013 the \u201cmost urgent priority of the next prime minister\u201d. I offer decisive leadership focused on the strength of our nation on the world stage, and delivering the opportunity for every individual to fulfil their aspirations and become the very best they can be. She told MPs she would kill off the withdrawal agreement and leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. And she set out three steps she said would be necessary in doing so: I will introduce a citizens rights bill to give certainty to UK citizens living in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK to lift the weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. I will also introduce an EU departure provisions bill which will agree areas such as sovereign bases and Gibraltar, our security relationship, data adequacy and air transport. Areas which are already agreed and welcomed by both sides. I will massively ramp up preparations for leaving with a managed exit at the end of October. I will speed up work on alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border and look at specific arrangements for just-in-time supply chains and agrifoods. This will give business the certainty it needs. Preparations will be completely transparent with regular updates to parliament. A delegation of ministers will be sent to talk directly with the EU27 heads of government about the wide range of measures the UK is taking to prepare for leaving on 31 October. It will be for the EU27 to decide what steps they want to accept. The UK would convene a summit in early September in Ireland or Northern Ireland to bring together the EU Council and the proposed new EU commissioners who were willing to grasp the issue ahead of the UK\u2019s exit. It is unclear for the moment how Leadsom plans to win over the Commons, where there has been no majority for a no-deal Brexit. She also set out other priorities. She proposes a cross-party commission on social care, \u201csupported by specialists in the field and members of the public. It will be tasked with producing a solution for social care provision that will last generations, regardless of who is in government\u201d. On the subject of the climate crisis, she said: I am proud of the Paris agreement and I will sign up to the Committee on Climate Change target of 0% target emissions by 2050. I will bid for the UK to host the UN Climate Change Conference in 2020. I will support our industrial strategy to promote clean energy, jobs and skills. Our overseas development aid will support decarbonisation overseas. Boris Johnson has told the hustings: The way to win in any seat is to stop banging on about Brexit and put that bawling baby to bed, pacify it and recapture the political agenda with one nation Conservatism. Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary and a supporter of Johnson, said there was now a \u201cdawning realisation\u201d among Tory MPs that \u201cBoris is the only one who is going to be able to save the party\u201d. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have arrived at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in Regent\u2019s Park, for dinner with the US president and his wife. Charles and Trump shared a joke as they stood at the entrance of the house for photographs. The UK\u2019s prime minister and foreign secretary are among the guests. The frontrunner, Boris Johnson, has been addressing Tory MPs, telling them a second Brexit referendum would be divisive and he would be \u201cagainst it with every fibre of my body\u201d. He ruled out a coalition with the Brexit party and said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour was \u201cthe weakest official opposition in a generation\u201d. On Brexit, he claimed the so-called Brady amendment to replace the Irish backstop was the only plan that had the support of the Commons. But he added that the government must be ready for a no-deal Brexit if necessary. Johnson may have a point about backing for the Brady amendment, which MPs narrowly passed back in January. But the EU showed no willingness to even consider playing along. My colleague, Rowena Mason, quotes Johnson as telling the MPs: We are looking at a very difficult situation and we must get ready, eventually but not immediately, to beat Jeremy Corbyn and put Farage back in his box. We are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on 31 Oct. I believe I am best placed to lift this party, beat Jeremy Corbyn and excite people about conservatism and conservative values. We need to realise the depth of the problems we face \u2013 unless we get on and do this thing (Brexit), we will be punished for a very long time. There is a very real choice between getting Brexit done and the potential extinction of this great party but I believe I can take on Farage and win back the voters being won over by him. Johnson also ruled out calling a general election. Trump has been meeting various pro-Brexit figures, including the two former cabinet ministers, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage. The US president has also been the object of protests, including in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London. Duncan Smith and Farage both made clear the process of the UK leaving the European Union was on the president\u2019s mind during their discussions. A spokesman for the former Tory leader said the meeting had \u201cbeen in the offing for a while\u201d. It covered a \u201cwhole range of subjects including Brexit\u201d, he added. It is reported that Paterson and Duncan Smith held talks on behalf of the hard Brexit-supporting Tory backbench group, the ERG: On his LBC show, Farage claimed that \u201cmost people will agree yesterday went very, very well [for Trump]\u201d, adding that the president himself \u2013 who claimed not to have seen protests against him \u2013 was pleased with it. Farage added: Clearly, it was a private meeting but what I can say is he was in top form, he was ebullient. He absolutely believes in Brexit, thinks it\u2019s the right thing for the country to do. He\u2019s obviously concerned it\u2019s taking a very long time. In Edinburgh, however, a crowd attended an anti-Trump demonstration, which was addressed by the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard and others. He told the audience: We say: \u2018no to war, yes to peace, no to Trump, yes to the citizens of America\u2019. Crowds gathered outside St Giles Cathedral, despite showers, to join the demonstration. Many were holding placards: People also gathered outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. Many held placards from Stand Up To Racism and the Unison union, with speakers on the Buchanan Street steps criticising comments made by the US president. One person held aloft a homemade sign saying: \u201cTrump - Feed Him To The Corgis.\u201d As the rain came down on the crowds, those gathered were encouraged to chant slogans such as \u201cDonald Trump, off our streets\u201d and \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d. And, in London, Sian Bahia has been speaking to some of the demonstrators. Katie Greene, a 45-year-old teacher, said: Trump is a misogynist, he is racist, he is rude and we don\u2019t like him. I was disgusted when it was announced that he is receiving a state visit \u2013 it\u2019s terrible. Even before he landed, he was being rude about our mayor. He should keep his nose right out of British politics. Doreen Witter, who is 64 and a student, said: I do not like anything that comes out of Trump\u2019s mouth. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019s supporting Farage and [Boris] Johnson; all they care about is being a celebrity. Trump, you and your family should go home. The first hustings of the Tory leadership contest is being held this evening. More than 80 of the party\u2019s MPs are packed into a Commons committee room, though no journalists \u2013 they\u2019ve been shut out. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has told the assembled MPs: If we make the wrong choice in this leadership election we could end up with a leader who thinks the way to lead is to exploit division. He warned that, if the party doesn\u2019t evolve, \u201cvoters will go for change in the form of Corbyn\u201d. And he added: If we make the wrong choice in this leadership election, we could end up with a leader who thinks the way to lead is to exploit division. Javid received a warm response, with banging of tables heard from outside, after telling the MPs: \u201cWe will not beat the Brexit Party by becoming the Brexit Party.\u201d The Conservatives have agreed to a rule change that will raise the threshold for those wishing to stand for the party\u2019s leadership \u2013 as 11 candidates vie for the role. The 1922 Committee, which represents backbench Tory MPs, and the Conservative Party Board met today to agree the changes and have announced a schedule for the contest. In short, candidates will have from 10am to 5pm next Monday to formally enter the race. They\u2019ll need a proposer and a seconder, as well as the support of six other MPs. A process of ballots among MPs will follow over the next fortnight, with the lowest-ranked falling out at each stage. Any candidate failing to secure the support of at least 5% (in effect, 16 votes) at the first stage on 13 June, will be eliminated. At the second, on 18 June, they will require at least 10% (or 32 votes). Further ballots are scheduled for the following two days and the process will be repeated until only two candidates remain. They will then face the party\u2019s membership, who\u2019ll decide the next leader. Once the parliamentary process is completed, CCHQ will assume responsibility for the administration of hustings and the vote of the Conservative party membership. This stage of the process will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22nd July, with the first membership hustings planned for the 22ndJune. Further details will be published in due course. \u2022 This entry was amended on 5 June 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the 1922 Committee as the 1992 Committee. This has been corrected. Earlier, we reported that six of Change UK\u2019s 11 MPs had decided to leave the party (see: 4.14pm). The remaining five \u2013 Anna Soubry, Chris Leslie, Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes and Joan Ryan \u2013 have now released a statement saying they plan to fight on with Soubry as their leader. Challenging the established political parties was never going to be easy. But we remain determined to fix Britain\u2019s broken politics and we are in this for the long haul. You may have heard the news that some of our MPs group have decided to leave Change UK, which is saddening and disappointing just at the moment we need to roll up our sleeves, challenge the Brexit emergency and champion sensible evidence-based policy-making in the face of the main parties drifting to the ideological fringes. We regret their decision, but it is vital we continue to lead and look forward to future elections \u2013 and get started on building our policies and party across the country. We have a responsibility to our amazing European election candidates and 100,000 supporters and the near-600,000 people who voted for us \u2013 as well as a duty to the country \u2013 to continue this task. The British people need more than regrets about the state of our politics, they need solutions. We are delighted that Anna Soubry has taken on the role as our new leader, and our hope is to quickly broaden out our nationwide leadership to include some of our key supporters and activists from across the country. Change UK doesn\u2019t just belong to MPs. It belongs to the country and those looking for a sense of hope and leadership to genuinely change our politics, not simply settle for the existing party status quo. We hope that you agree this is a cause worth fighting for \u2013 and we will need your help and support going forward. While British politics slips into chaos around us, now is the time to stand firm in our beliefs and champion the mainstream centre ground values we articulated when we left our former parties in the first place. Nigel Farage is not the only Brexiter who has been to the US ambassador\u2019s resident to meet President Trump this afternoon. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, and Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary, have both seen the president. They were photographed leaving. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Piers Morgan, a friend of Donald Trump\u2019s since he appeared on Trump\u2019s US show Celebrity Apprentice, has interviewed the US president for Good Morning Britain, the ITV show he now co-presents. Kit Malthouse has withdrawn from the Tory leadership contest. In his statement explaining why, he does not quite say he had no realistic chance of winning - the explanation offered by James Cleverly this morning when he announced he was withdrawing his own candidacy. (See 11.32am.) Instead he argued that a relative unknown like himself (someone from \u201ca new generation\u201d) could only win if there were a lengthy contest but that he accepted the party wanted this contest over as soon as possible. In the ConservativeHome tally this morning, Malthouse had just six declared supporters - two more than Cleverly. There are still 11 contenders left in the field. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has tweeted about his meeting this afternoon with President Trump. Here are the main points from the Trump/May press conference. Donald Trump, the US president, confirmed that the US would want to include access to the NHS market in any US-UK trade talks. Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, said this at the weekend, and Trump was asked if he agreed with Johnson that the entire economy should be on the table in trade talks, including the NHS. He replied: I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you\u2019re dealing in trade, everything is on the table - so NHS or anything else, a lot more than that, but everything will be on the table, absolutely. But, as my colleague Patrick Wintour points out, Theresa May had to explain to Trump what the NHS was. In response, Theresa May pushed back, saying that there would only be a deal if both sides agreed. The point in making trade deals is of course that both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future. Trump\u2019s answer has generated a row, with both Labour and Tory politicians insisting that the NHS would not be included in a potential US-UK trade deal. (See 3.53pm and 4.04pm.) But Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, reckons that the whole row is a red herring because US trade deals never oblige governments to privatise public services like the NHS in the ways critics claim this deal might. Trump withdrew the US threat to stop sharing intelligence with the UK because of its policy over Huawei and 5G, claiming that the two countries now agreed on this issue. Asked if the US would impose limits on intelligence-sharing if the UK used Huawei infrastructure, he replied: No, because we\u2019re gonna have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. We did discuss it - I see absolutely no limitations, we\u2019ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner and we\u2019ll have no problem with that. The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith claims this is a win for May. But it is not clear what the \u201cagreement\u201d is that Trump was referring to, because Downing Street said this matter was still being reviewed. Trump criticised Jeremy Corbyn as a \u201cnegative force\u201d and said the Labour leader had requested a meeting with him - despite boycotting the state banquet held in Trump\u2019s honour. Asked about Corbyn, Trump said: [Corbyn] wanted to meet today or tomorrow and I decided I would not do that. I think he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticise. I really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done - so I decided not to meet. Trump backed Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as candidates for next prime minister, but claimed he did not know what Michael Gove would be like. He said: I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job. I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job. I don\u2019t know Michael - would he do a good job? Tell me. Trump defended his decision to criticise Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. He said: I think he has been a not very good mayor from what I understand. He has done a poor job, crime is up, a lot of problems, and I don\u2019t think he should be criticising a representative of the US that can do so much good for the UK ... He should be positive not negative - he is a negative force not a positive force. If you look at what he said, he hurts the people of this great country and I think he should actually focus on his job, it would be a lot better if he did that - he could straighten out some of the problems that he has caused. He said that May deserved \u201ca lot of credit\u201d for her work on Brexit. He said a deal was now \u201cteed up\u201d. He said: I think it will happen and I believe the prime minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she\u2019s done a very good job. He said Brexit \u201cprobably should happen\u201d - but he refused to say Britain should definitely leave at the end of October with or without a deal. Asked if the UK should go ahead and leave the UK on 31 October without a deal, he refused to answer, implying that he had not been following the issue in enough detail. On Brexit generally, he said: I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country and it wants its own identity ... I believe it would be good for the country, yes. In the past Trump was much more positive about Brexit, telling a press conference with May in January 2017 that it would be \u201ca wonderful thing\u201d for Britain. He claimed (falsely - see 3.49pm) that thousands of people had been cheering him on the streets of London. Asked about the protests, he said: We left the prime minister, the Queen, the royal family, there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. Even coming over today there were thousands of people cheering. Then I heard there were protests, I said \u2018Where are the protests? I don\u2019t see any protests\u2019. I did see a small protest today when I came - very small - so a lot of it is fake news I hate to say. He said Nato countries should spend more on defence if they were not meeting the 2% target. Nato countries are supposed to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Trump said: The United Kingdom is also a key partner in Nato. The prime minister and I agree that our Nato allies must increase their defence spending. They have no choice, they must fulfil their obligations. Nigel Farage has arrived at the US ambassador\u2019s residence for a meeting with Donald Trump, Reuters is reporting. And here is the picture. Earlier my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot reported that Change UK, the new party set up by eight Labour MPs and three Tories after they left their respective parties, was about to split. (See 12.26pm.) Heidi Allen, who was Change UK\u2019s interim leader, has now put out a statement confirming this. Six of the party\u2019s 11 MPs are leaving to sit as independents. Jeremy Corbyn claims that the NHS would end up up for sale under the \u201cno-deal disaster capitalism plans\u201d for a trade deal with the US championed by Tory leadership contenders. (See 3.53pm.) But Dominic Raab, one of the most rightwing leadership contenders, and one of those most relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, says Corbyn is wrong. And Matt Hancock, the current health secretary and another leadership contender, is saying the same thing. Yesterday Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and another leadership contender, said he agreed with Hancock on this issue. And Sam Gyimah, the leadership contender seen as having the least chance of winning, also says the NHS should not be on the table in a US-UK trade deal. This is from Jeremy Corbyn on the Trump/May press conference. This is from the BBC\u2019s James Cook. The Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor, Pippa Crerar, thinks Labour should have admitted that President Trump refused to meet Jeremy Corbyn before Trump said so at this press conference. This is from the Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale, confirming the point I made earlier about President Trump\u2019s lying about crowd sizes being habitual. Donald Trump is famously unpredictable, but that does not mean he always causes mayhem at a news conference (which would make him too easy to predict). There have been occasions when he has run riot at events like this, like the Nato summit in Brussels last year or his last press conference with Theresa May, at Chequers last summer, when he praised Boris Johnson, advised May to adopt a tougher stance over Brexit, and tried (only half-successfully) to wind back comments he made in an interview with the Sun saying the Chequers plan would scupper a UK-US trade deal. And there have been occasions when he has come over as unexpectedly emollient, as he was in the very first Trump/May press conference in the White House in January 2017. Today, he was on relatively good behaviour. True, at one point he made a completely ludicrous claim about there being thousands of people on the streets of London to welcome him yesterday, but it is as if lying about the size of crowds has become such a Trump trademark that it no longer seems particularly shocking. On the more substantive stuff, he sounded as if he was out to be helpful. He claimed that the Huawei row between the UK and the US was all but resolved - which may not be true (you can never be sure with Trump), but which may at least lower the temperature a bit in talks with Washington. He confirmed that he would like everything to be on the table in a UK-US trade deal, but it sounded as if he was coaxed into saying this, and it did not seem as if he was setting out to be provocative (even though to some he was - the quotes criticising him on this are already coming in). And, above all, he went out of his way to be complimentary about Theresa May - not in an exaggerated way, like last year; today he sounded more sincere, as if he were acting out of consideration, and perhaps even pity. This may well be the last full-on press conference that May holds as prime minister, and it was all rather valedictory. Given that the UK will have a new prime minister in the next few weeks, what Trump had to say about May\u2019s potential successor was perhaps more important than anything he said about May. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both got the thumbs up, but rather surprisingly, despite Michael Gove\u2019s hagiographic journalism (see 12.54pm), Trump said he did not have a view about him. It felt a bit as if he was reserving judgment. And he also sounded a lot more non-committal about Brexit than in the past. At his press conference with May in Washington in January 2017 he said that Brexit was going to be a \u201cwonderful thing\u201d for the UK. Today, while not criticising Brexit, he sounded more cautious about celebrating it. Perhaps even he is realising that it is all not as easy as Johnson and Gove promised. Labour has put out this statement about Jeremy Corbyn requesting a meeting with Donald Trump. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn proposed a meeting with Donald Trump during the president\u2019s visit. Jeremy is ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis. Labour sources are confirming that Jeremy Corbyn did request a meeting with President Trump, as he revealed in the press conference. (See 2.25pm.) Q: [To May] Do you think a deal on Brexit is possible? Would it have made a difference if you had followed Trump\u2019s advice on what to do? May says she still thinks it is in the best interests of the UK to leave the EU with a deal. It will be for whoever succeeds her to take this forward. She says Trump advised her to sue. She decided not to. She negotiated and got a good deal. Trump says he would have sued. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. He says he may have settled. He says May has done a good job. Q: [To Trump] What did you say in your conversation with Boris Johnson? And will you meet Michael Gove? Trump says he knows Johnson and likes him. And he knows Jeremy Hunt and likes him too. But he does not know Gove, he says. Trump endorses Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as possible successors to Theresa May. But he says he does not know Michael Gove. And that\u2019s it. I will post a verdict, summary and reaction shortly. Trump says Mexico should stop millions of people entering the US illegally. Mexico can do this, he says. If Mexico does not, the US will keep increasing tariffs. He says he does not want to believe that Mexico is run by drug cartels. Q: [To Trump] Should everything be on the table in the talks on a UK-US trade deal? Trump says \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in the talks. But May says there will only be a deal if both sides agree. Q: [To May] Will you take Trump\u2019s advice and stay on? \u201cNice try\u201d, says May. She says she is a woman of her word. Q: Should the UK leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal? Trump suggests he has not been following this closely. But he thinks the UK should leave. He claims May has brought the UK to a very good point in this regard. Trump says May has brought the UK to a \u201cgood point\u201d in the Brexit negotiation. Q: Will you refuse the UK intelligence because of its involvement with Huawei? Trump says this will not be a problem because the UK and the US will reach an agreement on what to do about Huawei. Trump says the US and the UK will reach an agreement about a joint approach to Huawei. They are now taking questions. Q: [To Trump] What would you say to Jeremy Corbyn? Could you do a trade deal with him? Trump says he does not know Corbyn. Corbyn wanted to meet with him today or tomorrow. He decided not to meet Corbyn, he says. He says he sees Corbyn as a \u201cnegative force\u201d. Trump claims Corbyn requested a meeting with him. Trump turned Corbyn down, he says. He describes him as a \u201cnegative force\u201d. Corbyn has been critical of him, he says. He says he does not like people who are critical. On the subject of the protests, Trump says there were \u201cthousands of people\u201d on the streets cheering him yesterday. And again today. He says he did not see protesters yesterday. He says he saw some today, but it was a very small group. The reports of the protests have been \u201cfake news\u201d. Trump claims \u201cthousands\u201d of people have been on the streets in London cheering him. (This is not true.) Q: [To May] Do you agree with Trump that Sadiq Khan is a stone cold loser? Trump replies to this. He says Khan has been a poor mayor. He is a negative force. He should focus on dealing with the problems he faces, Trump says. Trump says he is looking forward to agreeing a \u201cphenomenal\u201d trade deal with the UK. He says he will be visiting the Churchill War Rooms later. And he ends by paying tribute to Theresa May, saying she is a professional, and that it has been a pleasure working with her. Trump says all members of the Nato alliance \u201cmust fulfill their obligations\u201d. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligations. Trump says Nato members who are not hitting the 2% target must increase defence spending. President Trump is speaking now. He starts by saying how much he appreciated the state banquet last night and the Queen\u2019s hospitality. Turning to D-day, he praises the way American and British soldiers worked together. He thanks Britain for its contribution to the fight against Islamic State (although he uses the term Isis). May says the events in Portsmouth tomorrow will celebrate the Nato alliance. She says the alliance between the UK and the US is just as strong as it was 75 years ago. She ends by shaking hands with Trump. (Someone is clearly worried by handshakegate. See 1.14pm and 1.31pm.) May summarises what she and Trump spoke about in their talks this morning. Cooperation had deepened on security, she says. And their economies too are more tightly bound together. Some 1 million Americans work for British companies, and 1 million Britons work for American companies, she says. She says she and Trump agreed they wanted an ambitious trade agreement after Brexit, and from their talks today she knows they are still committed to this. Theresa May is speaking now. She says this week we commemorate D-day, 75 years ago. The British and Americans have been historic partners, she says. They have shared values, and those values will endure for the next 75 years and beyond, she says. That is why she is so pleased to welcome President Trump to the UK. She says for the last two years she and Trump have been the guardians of this friendship. She reminds the audience who they have worked together, particularly when the US expelled Russian diplomats after the Salisbury attack and in responding to the use of chemical weapons in Syria. (From my office in the Commons, with the windows open, we can hear the anti-Trump protest getting much louder.) From CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein From NBC\u2019s Bill Neely Donald Trump and Theresa May are now walking from No 10 to the Foreign Office, which is just the other side of Downing Street, followed by their spouses. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From Ben Riley-Smith, the Telegraph\u2019s US editor The Trump-May press conference is starting very soon. This is from the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman. Just a few hundred United Against Trump protesters were in Parliament Square just before 1.30pm, where some were engaged in a confrontation with pro-Trump supporters who had come out to welcome the president and counter the demonstration against his presence in London. Bob Marley tracks played quietly from a mobile stage in front of Westminster Abbey and political groups had stalls set up around the perimeter of the square, but it appeared as though the Parliament Square rally had been abandoned. As the Guardian made its way to the area, along Embankment, many people were walking the opposite direction, back towards Whitehall. Political debate between pro- and anti-Trump protesters did not manage to surpass name calling, with one man\u2019s chant of \u201cStop Trump\u201d met with \u201cBye bye EU\u201d, and an anti-Trump protester telling one man to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. Among those welcoming Trump to London was Lorraine Chappell, a retiree from London who wore a union flag as a scarf and carried a placard saying \u201cWelcome President Trump\u201d. She said: I\u2019m protesting today to welcome Donald Trump to London because America is our greatest ally and Donald Trump is a strong leader. I\u2019m hoping [the UK will] do trade deals with the USA post-Brexit and he\u2019s here today on the invitation of the Queen and these people should show some respect. On the protesters, Chappell said: It\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. I\u2019m sure they are happy to go and have their holidays in America, but they are not happy to support its president. If the Queen went and [the Americans] made a balloon of the Queen we would be horrified. America helped us to win the war. At the end of the day, without them we would all be speaking German by now. We are in the minority, we know, and that\u2019s why we came out here today. I don\u2019t know what the Americans must think of this country if they saw what\u2019s going on today. You can love him [Trump] or you can hate him, but you should show him respect. Here is another anti-Trump protester in London explaining why she is demonstrating. And here are some pictures of Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Whitehall. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at the anti-Trump demonstration in Whitehall. He welcomes the diversity of the crowd. Addressing complaints about his decision to boycott the state banquet last night, he says he is not refusing to meet anyone. He would be willing to talk to President Trump, he says. But he condemns Trump for his attack on Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. He says he is very proud to have a Muslim as mayor of London. Corbyn restates his opposition to racism. He says he would never accept a trade deal that ended up with the NHS being up for sale. He adds the NHS must stay free at the point of deliver. He also criticises Trump\u2019s record on refugees, and says refugees should never be treated as enemies. They are fellow human beings, he says. From there, he moves on to war and reminds the audience that he opposed the Iraq war in 2003. (At this point he is moving away from Trump, to an extent \u2013 Trump also says the Iraq war was a mistake.) Corbyn ends by saying that a few weeks ago the Commons voted for a motion saying the UK was facing a climate emergency. And he says \u201cprotest and activism\u201d eventually lead to change. More from the venue for the May-Trump press conference. More on handshakegate. (See 1.14pm.) To me, the explanation that you do not shake hands with someone you shook hands with at a meeting an hour or so earlier seems perfectly sound. That\u2019s the No 10 explanation. But the White House pool has offered a different take. The pool reporter says: To clarify on handshakes, PM May shook hands with FLOTUS and greeted POTUS but did not shake hands with him as FLOTUS was reaching across to shake Philip May\u2019s hand. For anyone who has never watched West Wing, POTUS stands for president of the United States and FLOTUS for first lady of the United States. There has been some interest on social media in the fact that, when Trump arrived at Downing Street, he did not shake Theresa May\u2019s hand \u2013 even though he did shake hands with her husband. But the encounter took place shortly after May and Trump attended a business breakfast together at St James\u2019s Palace (see 11.10am), where they did shake hands. \u201cOne only shakes another\u2019s hand once in a day,\u201d said a No 10 source, quite reasonably. President Trump will be visiting the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall later with Theresa May, the White House pool is reporting. Melania Trump and Philip May will attend too. But Boris Johnson will not be going. At one stage, when the state visit was being planned, there was talk of Johnson giving Trump a tour because Johnson has written a biography of Churchill and is seen as something of an expert. But that might have to wait for another day ... According to the Daily Mirror, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and favourite in the contest to succeed Theresa May, has had a \u201cfriendly\u201d 20-minute conversation with President Trump. But Johnson turned down an invitation to meet Trump tonight because he is due to attend a private hustings organised by One Nation Tories in the Commons, the Mirror reports. According to Owen Bennett, the journalist who is publishing a biography of Michael Gove next month, Gove was rather more critical of Donald Trump before his election as president than he was when he interviewed him a few weeks later for the Times. (See 12.54pm.) Judging by the interview that President Trump gave to the Sun and the Sunday Times before he came to the UK, his view of people tends to be shaped to a considerable extent by whether or not they have praised him. (\u201cI think Boris [Johnson] would be excellent. I like him. I have always liked him ... He has been very positive about me and our country.\u201d) On that basis, Trump\u2019s meeting with Michael Gove later (see 10.55am and 12.07pm) is likely to go well. I have been rereading Gove\u2019s write-up of his interview with Trump in January 2017 (paywall) and it\u2019s not exactly a hatchet job. Here\u2019s an extract. Ever since a Virginia farmer called George Washington launched his bid for glory, the British have had a tendency to underestimate American presidents. Especially Republicans. When Abraham Lincoln was in the White House, our government sympathised with the Confederacy. When Ronald Reagan was commander-in-chief, the British foreign policy establishment derided him as a trigger-happy cowboy who was in danger of pitching us into a third world war. But no Republican, indeed no president, has come to office facing anything like the level of scorn and condescension from British politicians and commentators as Mr Trump. When we talked last Friday, however, he had nothing but kind words and generous sentiments for a nation he believes will be his strongest ally ... He\u2019s no Kissinger and you\u2019d no more expect him to discuss Clausewitz and Kennan than set fire to his own hair. But intelligence takes many forms. And Mr Trump\u2019s number-rich analysis of defence spending reflects a businessman\u2019s ability to cut through jargon to get to the essentials of a case. The same Trump who uses gladiatorial press conferences and CAPITALISED tweets to hurl huge crude blocks of rhetoric at opponents is also the master of the P&amp;L accounts and the determined negotiator who sees government as a failing corporation ripe for re-engineering ... Mr Trump\u2019s conversation flows like a river in spate, overwhelming interruptions and objections, reflecting the force of nature that is the man. But it would be a mistake to think that he is all instinct and impulse. He wants to bring to governing the same calculating business style that he has brought to communicating. While he has been criticised for tweeting attacks on everyone from Meryl Streep to the civil rights hero John Lewis, he has no intention of abandoning Twitter because he believes it gives him a direct connection to the American people. More from my colleague Damien Gayle on why people are protesting against Trump. We have got more than an hour to wait until the Trump-May press conference starts, but, as is usual for these events, the journalists have been told to arrive extra early. They are in the Foreign Office and, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports, at least they\u2019re in a nice room. From the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel. At least half of Change UK\u2019s 11 MPs are poised to leave the fledgling political party, after its dismal performance at the European elections, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot report. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has described President Trump as a poster boy for the far-right. Expanding on comments he made yesterday, Khan said: The reality is, when you look around the world there are many leaders whose views I find abhorrent \u2013 in Hungary, in Italy, in France, here in the UK, and the poster boy they look up to is Donald Trump. And it should be a source of concern to us that Donald Trump is the poster boy for the far-right movement around the world and actually some of the things that he has done as president are deeply objectionable, far more objectionable than silly tweets he might send. During the visit to Downing Street, the prime minister and president, along with their spouses, viewed the Sussex Declaration \u2013 a rare copy of the American Declaration of Independence on sheepskin parchment dating back to the 1780s, the Press Association reports. As anti-Trump protesters began their slow march down Whitehall, hundreds of placards remained on the ground around Trafalgar Square, suggesting that organisers had not achieved the numbers expected, or indeed matched those of the last Trump demo. The square had not quite been filled. Nevertheless, as promised by organisers and despite persistent drizzle, there was indeed a carnival atmosphere on the demonstration, with samba bands and whistles accompanying the thousands slowly streaming towards parliament. They will only make it halfway. Police have erected barricades along Whitehall to prevent protests outside Downing Street. Instead the demonstration will halt at the Women of world war two memorial, where a stage will feature speakers, then take a circuitous route to Parliament Square for a mass rally. The anti-Trump protesters have been moving down Whitehall, Sky News reports. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning a spokeswoman for the prime minister said the UK decision about whether or not to allow Huawei to play a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure (see 10.41am) would be based on a \u201chard-headed technically-informed assessment of the risk\u201d. Talking about Theresa May\u2019s meeting with President Trump, the spokeswoman said: The PM will be setting out the UK position, we\u2019re obviously reviewing the right policy approach at the moment. The PM and others have been clear that any decision we take there will be supported by hard-headed technically-informed assessment of the risk. We\u2019re reviewing the right policy approach and when an announcement is ready we will update parliament. A source close to Michael Gove has confirmed that the environment secretary has been asked to meet Donald Trump, as Sky was reporting earlier. (See 10.55am.) The source said: Mr Gove was asked last night by Mr Trump\u2019s team if he would be able to meet the president today. He said yes. Nothing has been fixed yet. As the Press Association reports, the source indicated the meeting was likely to be on a one-to-one basis, which could prove embarrassing to Theresa May as her talks with the president are likely to involve senior ministers and officials rather than just the two leaders. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has a list of some of the people lined up to speak at the anti-Trump demonstration. Activists promised to meet Donald Trump with a \u201ccarnival of resistance\u201d in London on Tuesday as they began gathering in protest again his state visit. Together Against Trump, an umbrella organisation formed of dozens of civil society groups, is hoping to bring hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets around Westminster. On Tuesday morning, before the 11am gathering time, there were already hundreds in Trafalgar Square, where bundles of placards were leant against street furniture and journalists made pieces to camera. At 11.30am protesters are due to march down Whitehall to the Women of world war two memorial \u2013 as far as they can make it since police have blocked the area outside Downing Street, apparently for security reasons \u2013 where a stage is erected for speakers including Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, and Caroline Lucas of the Green party, among others. They will then march around the Embankment, past New Scotland Yard into Parliament Square, where a second stage will feature music artists and more speakers including, it is expected, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. Michael Hewitt, a retired clergyman from Bromley, was wandering past the fountains holding a piece of white A4 paper with the message, \u201cToxic Trump out\u201d. \u201cI think his views are toxic, just toxic \u2013 how do you sum him up?\u201d Hewitt said. Asked what his message to Trump would be, he said: \u201cGet real, face reality of climate change and the interdependence of nations and stop being nationalistic. Patriotism is different from nationalism.\u201d Turning back to the Tory leadership contest for a moment, James Cleverly, the Brexit minister who was one of several unexpected contenders in the Conservative leadership contests (or no-hopers, if you want to be more cynical), has announced that he is withdrawing from the contest. As of this morning, he had just four MPs supporting him. Explaining his decision in a statement on his website, he said: Last week I announced that I intended to run for the leadership of the Conservative party and as prime minister. I felt that we needed to deliver Brexit and then quickly move the conversation on to other important issues that face the country. I had hoped that the Conservative parliamentary party would support me to be the face and voice of that conversation. To do this I asked them to make a leap of faith, skip a generation and vote for a relatively new MP. It is clear that despite much support, particularly from our party\u2019s grassroots, MPs weren\u2019t comfortable with such a move and it has become clear that it is highly unlikely that I would progress to be one of the final two candidates. For this reason I have withdrawn from the process of selecting a new leader and will not be submitting nomination papers. Interviewed on BBC News a moment ago, Cleverly refused to say who he would now be backing for leader. And here is the scene in Trafalgar Square, where the anti-Trump protest is getting underway. President Trump has arrived now at Downing Street. President Trump and Theresa May have been holding roundtable talks with business leaders at St James\u2019s Palace. According to the Press Association, Trump said the US was already the UK\u2019s largest trading partner and that he believed there was scope for further expansion. He said: I think we will have a very, very substantial trade deal. This is something you want to do and my folks want to do. He even suggested that May should rethink her decision to resign. He told her: Stick around. Let\u2019s do this deal. (Presumably that was intended as more of a joke than as a constructive suggestion.) May said that there were \u201chuge opportunities\u201d for Britain and the US to work together in the future. She said: It is a great partnership but I think a partnership we can take even further. Of course that is with a good bilateral trade deal. I think there are huge opportunities for us to do more together in the future and challenges to work on as well. A Chinese-made talking robot of Donald Trump sitting on a gold toilet has become the focal point of anti Trump protests in Trafalgar Square. As the Guardian revealed last month, the 4.9-metre (16ft) object depicts Trump with his trousers down, tweeting on the toilet, while his long red tie dangles into the bowl. It emits recordings of some of Trump\u2019s provocative sound bites including: \u201cno collusion\u201d, \u201ca witch-hunt\u201d, \u201cyou are fake news\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a very stable genius.\u201d Its creator, Don Lessem, a dinosaur expert from Philadelphia, travelled to London to mark the robot\u2019s debut at the protests. Standing beside his creation he claimed comedy was the best way to defeating Trump. \u201cHumour is my weapon,\u201d he said. The robot also makes a farting sound. Lessem said: \u201cThe fart we couldn\u2019t get from him so we had to use a generic fart.\u201d Lessem said he had no problem getting the robot built in Sichuan and then shipped from China to the UK. He said: The factory manager was shocked that we could make fun of our president without repercussions but had no fear of consequences for them in doing so. Trump is not on the Chinese government\u2019s list of favourites, and one of the first papers to pick up the Guardian\u2019s story was the South China News. Since the government keeps particularly close tabs on publications, it\u2019s a tacit indication that the robot is actually appreciated by Chinese authorities. It was a debate as to how to categorise the robot for shipping purposes. I chose \u2018toy\u2019 over \u2018art\u2019. A message to Trump from a protester. These are from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner. Gove, the environment secretary and probably Boris Johnson\u2019s leading rival in the contest to be the next Tory leader and prime minister, famously met Trump shortly after his election as president when he interviewed him for the Times. At the time Gove was a backbencher (Theresa May sacked him when she became prime minister in 2016) and writing for the Times, where he used to work full-time as an editor and columnist before becoming an MP. Rupert Murdoch, owner of the Times, is thought to have played a role in securing the interview, which was regarded as a journalistic scoop, even if Gove\u2019s questioning was not noted for being over-critical. Here is an excerpt. In any Tory leadership contest it is always worth knowing who the Murdoch candidate is. This year it\u2019s probably Gove. One of the biggest issues likely to come up in the talks between Donald Trump and Theresa May today is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications firm, and whether the UK will allow it to play a role in building its 5G infrastructure. The US says Huawei should be excluded because it is a security risk. It argues that the firm is effectively controlled by the Chinese government, which could use Huawei technology to spy on Western communications. It has warned that it might stop sharing intelligence with the UK if it allows Huawei a role in its 5G network. The British government has not yet taken a final decision about what to do, but officials believe it is possible to allow Huawei a role in 5G without compromising security. This long blog, written in February by Ian Levy, technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre, helps to explain why. As my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Patrick Wintour report in their story on this today, there are also other reasons why Whitehall is sceptical of the US threat to turn off the supply of intelligence information if the UK offers contracts to Huawei. They write: British civil servants stressed that the UK had a unique architecture in its telecoms network, and the country could not simply take a decision to try to exclude itself from the long-term growth in Chinese economic influence. They added that the chief priorities were protection of the UK-US intelligence relationship as well as a diversification of choice among network technology providers and and an increase in telecoms standards. Other former Whitehall insiders said the next prime minister would have leverage to resist the US warnings. The US is reliant on UK signals intelligence for the targeting of missions in Syria and Iraq. The belief of British officials is that the Trump administration argument against Huawei is essentially economic, part of a growing battle over trade between the world\u2019s largest economy and China. This morning Ben Wallace, the security minister, was on the Today programme discussing this issue. He said that, contrary to the impression given by a recent story in the Daily Telegraph, the government has not yet taken a final decision on this. (The Telegraph said the National Security Council had decided to allow Huawei a partial role in the 5G project, a leak that eventually led to Gavin Williamson being sacked as defence secretary, after May concluded he was responsible.) But Wallace also said the issue of \u201cfair play\u201d would be an issue in the decision. He explained: Alongside the technical questions is obviously the question of behaviour of a number of states. We\u2019re British \u2013 we believe in fair play \u2013 and I think if we want to allow people access to our markets we have to say there are rules ... Not using the espionage to steal our intellectual property. How do we maintain a level playing field and fair play that allows foreign investment, foreign access to our markets, and vice versa, but people don\u2019t exploit that goodwill to steal and cheat? This sounded like Wallace was preparing an alternative justification for the UK taking a decision to exclude Huawei along the lines requested by the US. \u201dYou won\u2019t get the contract, not because our network would not be safe, but because of China\u2019s record on stealing intellectual property generally,\u201d (I paraphrase) \u2013 but it was hard to be sure. The White House pool has released details of Trump\u2019s gifts to the Queen and Prince Philip. The Queen got a silver and silk poppy brooch, in a White House jewellery box. Prince Phillip got a personalised Air Force One jacket and a first edition signed autobiography by James Doolittle, I Could Never Be So Lucky Again. Doolittle was an American general of the second world war. The Queen gave Trump a first edition of Churchill\u2019s Second World War (all six volumes, presumably, although the pool report does not say). He also got a three-piece Duofold pen set. And the Queen\u2019s gift to Melania Trump was a specially-commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid. Liam Fox has backed the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to be the next Conservative leader, in a further splintering of cabinet endorsements which has seen ministers back candidates in five different directions, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. In response, Hunt posted this on Twitter. ConservativeHome has been keeping a daily tally of leadership endorsements by Tory MPs. According to their latest update (posted just before 8am this morning, but including Fox), Boris Johnson has been publicly backed by 42 Conservative MPs, which puts him ahead of Jeremy Hunt (on 32), Michael Gove (29), Dominic Raab (24), Sajid Javid (17), Matt Hancock (11), Kit Malthouse and Esther McVey (both on 6), Mark Harper and Rory Stewart (both on 5), James Cleverly (4) and Andrea Leadsom (3). Sam Gyimah, who declared at the weekend that he was standing on a platform backing a second referendum, does not seem to have any endorsements. Meanwhile, in Parliament Square, protesters are inflating the Trump blimp (the balloon portraying Trump as a giant baby) that will be flying above London for two hours today. You can watch a live video feed of it being prepared here. President Trump has just arrived at Buckingham Palace by helicopter. From there he will travel by car to St James\u2019s Palace, which is very near, for a meeting with business leaders. We all like showing off our holiday photos and videos. President Trump is no exception, and he has just posted this on Twitter. The video only lasts one minute. That obviously did not leave the White House time to include footage of the \u201ctremendous crowds\u201d. (See 9.12am.) Well, at least one person is happy about Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK. This is what the US president was saying last night after visiting Buckingham Palace for lunch with the Queen. His reference to the \u201ctremendous crowds\u201d will surprise anyone who was in London or watching the news yesterday and the White House has not tweeted any pictures of these huge crowds of Trump fans \u2013 probably for the obvious reason that they they don\u2019t exist. (Some of the time yesterday, even for relatively short journeys, Trump was being whisked across the capital by helicopter \u2013 like a senior politician visiting a war zone \u2013 and even when he was driven by car, the police kept the pavements clear out of fear that his convoy might get the milkshake treatment, or worse.) Still, why let the facts etc etc. You can tell from the pictures being tweeted by the White House why Trump, who is said to aspire to be treated like a monarch, was so grateful to get a warm reception from a real one. Today we get the political side of the state visit, with Trump going to Downing Street for talks with Theresa May and a press conference. Given that May will be out of office within a few weeks, it is hard to see the point, and Trump might have been better advised to spend his time talking to Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to succeed her. (It is still not clear whether or not Trump will meet Johnson during the downtime available in his schedule.) But even if the talks are stilted, the press conference is unlikely to be dull. And, while Trump is meeting May, thousands of people are expected to be nearby in London protesting against him. They will include Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who also chose to boycott last night\u2019s state dinner. This morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the Today programme why Corbyn, who would be having to deal with Trump as prime minister if an early general election led to a Labour government, was taking this stance. She said: A state visit is an honour and we don\u2019t think this president deserves an honour. The truth is he has tried to close borders with Muslim-majority countries, he is caging small Mexican children, he has grabbed women and boasted about it. He is a sexual predator, he is a racist and it\u2019s right to say that \u2013 we need to think about when is it our country got so scared? Thornberry also explained why Corbyn refused to go to a state dinner for Trump while he attended one for the president of China, a country with a far, far worse human rights record than the US. She said: When you have a close friend and they\u2019re going wrong, you are more likely to be adamant with them and clearer with them than someone who has not been as close a friend and someone you are trying to build a relationship up with. She said Trump needed to be stood up to \u201clike the way you deal with a bully\u201d because \u201cif you bow down in front of them you just get kicked harder\u201d. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons and a Tory leadership candidate, holds a phone-in on LBC. 9.20am: President Trump is due to arrive at Buckingham Palace. He will then go to St James\u2019s Palace for a meeting with business leaders. 9.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, speaks at the RUSI thinktank. 11am: Corbyn is among those speaking at the anti-Trump demonstration starting in Trafalgar Square. Anti-Trump protests are also taking place in other cities, such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee. Between 10am and 12pm the Trump blimp will be flying over Parliament Square. 11.20am: Trump is due to arrive at Downing Street for talks with Theresa May and other ministers. There will then be a working lunch. 1.45pm: Trump and May hold a press conference. 7pm: Tory leadership candidates Sajid Javid, Boris Johnson, Kit Malthouse and Andrea Leadsom are due to speak at a private hustings in the Commons organised by the One Nation group of Tory MPs. Evening: Trump hosts a dinner for May and other British dignitaries at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence. The Prince of Wales will represent the Queen. And at some point today the executive of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee will meet to discuss changing the rules to reduce the number of contenders in the Tory leadership contest. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Trump visit and the press conference. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
