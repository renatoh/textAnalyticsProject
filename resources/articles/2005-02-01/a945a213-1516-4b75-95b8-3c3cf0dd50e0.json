Dr Jane Wilson-Howarth is a GP, mum, and medical expert on taking children to faraway places. She knows everything about jabs, bugs, and jippy tummies. So it's good news that a new edition of her Your Child Abroad - A Travel Health Guide has just come out (bradt-travelguides.com). I needed her just before we went to Goa. Although the risk of malaria there is low, it's never too low to take precautions. I consulted my GP surgery, where all the kids were properly weighed and prescribed appropriate doses of chloroquine and paludrine, which come in travel packs. It was important for the practice nurse to measure the kids' kilos. The travel packs give dosage by age only, which doesn't take into account how different kids are. My 12 year old weighs the same as some eight year olds, and some 12 year olds weigh more than me. So, to be sure they get the correct dose, they should stand on the scales. As usual, I left all this a bit late, and a couple of days before we went I cut up the capsules and dished them out. Within minutes, three-year-old River blew up like a balloon. He'd had an allergic reaction. That left just 48 hours to figure out an appropriate prophylaxis for him. Goa, especially outside the rains, is very low risk. But malaria isn't something you should muck about with. Dr Jane is critical of the new trend of family safaris to sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is particularly rife. \"If a child's too young to tell you how they feel - whether their belly or head aches - then they're too young to be taken to a highly malarious area,\" she says. Her advice is to save safaris, unless to malaria-free areas, until the kids are school age and can point to the right bits of their body, so everyone knows where it hurts. \u00b7 Please send tips for sharing through deabirkett.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
