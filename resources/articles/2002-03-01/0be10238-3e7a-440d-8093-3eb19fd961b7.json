But Trapattoni, when asked which Englishmen had caught his eye last night, mentioned Wayne Bridge and the words \"grand surprise\" in his reply. Trapattoni also used Joe Cole's name, but raised the age profile after that by saying that Gareth Southgate was \"bellisimo\". Southgate will be chuffed understandably at that, but if there were peppy bubbles to come out of a flat night for England, it was in the performances of Bridge, in particular, and Cole, with reservations. That Bridge is 21 and Cole 20 is of obvious charm, and there was further hope for young England in the relative assurance 21-year-old Ledley King showed on his international debut. In front of King, Owen Hargreaves, another of 21, also did more than players older than him in the same position. It is a quartet of reasons for the optimism about English football but for Sven-Goran Eriksson there are more immediate matters: can he trust players of this age and inexperience in a World Cup? \"I think Owen Hargreaves did very well,\" Eriksson said of the Bayern Munich midfielder before expanding his answer to incorporate others in the adolescent category. \"He's very quick and puts a lot of energy into the game, he's a ball-winner. \"Joe Cole, Wayne Bridge and he are very talented players, but they are very young and lack experience. Hargreaves has played for Bayern Munich for only one full year and you can't be ready after that. But it's good for England and they have a good future. If that future is in two months or six months or one year, I don't know. \"The positive is that we had a very young team and in the second half even younger. And we were equal against Italy. Ledley King did well, normally he plays in a back three, tonight he was in a back four. \"It was very good for young players to play in a game against teams like Italy. You're young and your opponents are able, they make you pay. But it's a lesson for the future and I'm not worried or angry about it. If you are young and you are playing against Italy for the first time in your life then you are entitled to make a mistake.\" That was of particular relevance for Cole and Hargreaves, but for Bridge there was only praise. \"I think he was very good,\" Eriksson said. \"He's a very modern defender - he knows how to defend, he knows how to attack and he has a good left foot. He's not afraid. The reason he played nearly 90 minutes was because he doesn't play in the Uefa Cup or Champions League like the others.\" It was David Platt, manager of the Under-21s, who apparently told Eriksson of Bridge's readiness for the senior squad, and Bridge - and Eriksson's reaction to him - suggests that he is now very close to rivalling Ashley Cole for the left-back berth when England take to the field in Saitama against Sweden. \"They have refined technique,\" said Trapattoni of Bridge and Joe Cole, \"in Italy we don't have many players of that stamp.\" Trapattoni may have been simply being generous in that assessment but his opinion carries the weight of experience, even if the players concerned do not. But as Eriksson stressed, these nights are about education. Even David Beckham concurred. \"Maybe it was a lesson in concentration,\" he said. \"We've learned a lot and we'll keep learning a lot. We're still a young team and every player's got to learn not to give the ball away because when we play teams like Italy in the World Cup it's not so easy to get it back.\" Trapattoni added: \"Everyone is talking about Argentina, Brazil and France as the main contenders for the World Cup but, for me, England should also be included, as well as Italy of course. \"After this game I still believe that is the case, although it is important that we do not got too excited about this result. I have great admiration for this nation and the England team. I have been here many times and it is difficult to play against them.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
