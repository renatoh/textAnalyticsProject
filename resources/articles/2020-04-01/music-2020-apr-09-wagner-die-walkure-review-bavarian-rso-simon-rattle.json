It began in 2015 with a well-received Rheingold, while this Walk\u00fcre is based on performances in Munich at the beginning of last year. The common denominator between the casts of the two sets is the excellent Elisabeth Kulman as Fricka, while Eric Halfvarson, Fafner in the previous instalment, is a rather gruff Hunding here. Most crucially, there\u2019s a different Wotan this time: where Rheingold had Michael Volle in the role, here it\u2019s James Rutherford, a lighter, more baritonal voice than Volle, and one who\u2019s at his best in his second-act exchanges with Fricka, but lacks real weight and warmth in the final-scene farewell. Alongside Kulman, the best singing comes from Stuart Skelton as an ardent Siegmund, but Eva Maria Westbroek\u2019s Sieglinde is troublingly tremulous, while Ir\u00e9ne Theorin\u2019s Br\u00fcnnhilde is never quite the dominating Valkyrie she really ought to be. The opening moments of the first act prelude are enough to confirm the excellence of the Bavarian orchestra\u2019s playing. Time and again it\u2019s the sheer quality of their instrumental contributions that diverts attention from indifferent singing, and Rattle\u2019s shaping of the score, which tends to parcel each scene up into easily digested morsels, only reinforces that impression; this is a Walk\u00fcre of scattered highlights rather than gradually accumulating dramatic power. This week\u2019s other pick Detlev Glanert\u2019s list of operas now stretches into double figures. The latest of them is Oceane, based upon Oceane von Parceval, a novel fragment by Theodor Fontane. It was premiered at the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, a year ago, and an impressive recording from those performances, conducted by Donald Runnicles with Maria Bengtsson in the title role, has been released on Oehms Classics. Hans-Ulrich Treichel\u2019s libretto completes what Fontane left unfinished; it tells of the arrival of the mysterious, apparently rootless Oceane in a quiet seaside resort on the Baltic coast, and her effect on the community there. If the central character seems to combine elements of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Rusalka, Debussy\u2019s M\u00e9lisande and even Berg\u2019s Lulu, then Glanert\u2019s score is rooted in the post-Romantic German tradition leading back through his teacher Hans Werner Henze to Berg and Richard Strauss. Dramatically and musically, it\u2019s all wonderfully assured and convincing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
