As the government tightens the rules on strike ballots and it becomes increasingly difficult to secure collective bargaining rights across fragmented workforces, O\u2019Grady told the Observer she planned a radical change in tactics: tapping into the fury of customers and local communities to win a better deal for neglected workers. \u201cWe need to create new models of trade unionism, because there\u2019s one thing about representing people in BT or BMW or the NHS, and there\u2019s something else about organising baristas and cinema workers and shopworkers.\u201d Citing the campaign at the Ritzy cinema in Brixton, south London, where staff fought off redundancies and won a living wage last October after the threat of a boycott by cinemagoers, O\u2019Grady said: \u201cImagine if we could scale that up to cinema workers in the whole industry. Imagine if we could win systematic broad support from families, communities and the public. Collective bargaining almost becomes \u2018citizen bargaining\u2019 with the employer, to win fair treatment for workers.\u201d In the US, community campaigns have helped win improvements in pay and conditions for staff in several industries, including fast food and retail. Retailer Walmart offered 500,000 staff a pay rise to $9 an hour last February after public protests. O\u2019Grady said that approach could be mirrored in the UK. \u201cIncreasingly we have used a quite proper sense of moral outrage about the treatment of workers.\u201d While some senior Labour figures have portrayed the party\u2019s election defeat as a rejection of policies championed by the unions, O\u2019Grady insists she is providing a voice for serious public concerns over inequality, runaway executive pay and exploitation at work, which are not being taken up by the political parties. \u201cI think we are in one of those transition periods where trade unions, social movements, other organisations, have to fill some of the space that\u2019s been left, which puts some responsibility on us. We\u2019re conscious of that, and we\u2019re planning initiatives to reach out to young workers in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a just cause.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
