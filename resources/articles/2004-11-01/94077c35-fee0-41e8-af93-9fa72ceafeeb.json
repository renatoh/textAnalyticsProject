He would be the first mob chief executed by the government in decades. The prosecutors told Massino's lawyers yesterday that they intend to ask for the death penalty for the killing in 1999 of Gerlando Sciascia, a captain in Massino's crime family. A lawyer for Massino, David Breitbart, said the decision was a \"parting gift\" from attorney-general John Ashcroft, who has resigned. \"It seems absolutely absurd,\" Mr Breitbart said. Massino was convicted in July of orchestrating a quarter-century of murder, racketeering, arson, extortion and other crimes and is awaiting sentencing. Sciascia was murdered after the reintroduction of the federal death penalty in 1988. The mob boss Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter, leader of Murder Inc, a group of hitmen, was executed in 1944. Massino, 61, had previously been the only accused head of one of New York's five mafia families not in prison or awaiting sentencing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
