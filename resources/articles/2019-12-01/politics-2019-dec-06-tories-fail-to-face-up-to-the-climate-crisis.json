How can the commitment by the Tories to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and focus on trade with countries beyond the EU squarewith the party\u2019s pledge to prioritise the environment? Surely concentrating on trade deals and partnerships far away from our nearest neighbours must entail countless more air miles and far longer ocean journeys, with inevitable increased fuel costs and greater marine pollution? Yet another good reason for not turning our backs on our EU partners and for giving the public a chance to have a vote solely on Brexit, rather than deliberately confusing it with a host of other issues in this general election. Joyce Quin Labour, House of Lords \u2022 On Thursday evening we attended a climate hustings in Newton Abbot. All candidates for the two constituencies covered \u2013 Central Devon and Newton Abbot \u2013 were invited and both sets of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green party candidates took part. Neither of the Conservative candidates \u2013 the current MPs \u2013 appeared and were empty chaired. One refused several invitations and the other withdrew after initially accepting. The message from this is the Conservatives have nothing to say about climate change and are willing to treat their constituents with contempt. Colin Corkerton Newton Abbot, Devon \u2022 We wonder whether the \u201csmall earthquake\u201d in Somerset (Report, theguardian.com, 6 December) might be the effect of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to blast his way out of the bunker that Tory central command has locked him up in pending the election.
