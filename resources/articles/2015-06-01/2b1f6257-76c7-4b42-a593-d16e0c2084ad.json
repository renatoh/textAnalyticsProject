One day after officially launching his presidential bid, Bush took on Barack Obama over the Islamic State, the pope over climate change and even his brother. But he mostly stuck with a tone of optimism, touting his own record as the governor of Florida, beginning to build the case for why he is best suited to steer the country away from what he dubbed failed Democratic priorities. \u201cPeople are stuck. The progressive agenda \u2013 it sounds good and it\u2019s alluring, but now we see what it looks like and it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Bush said at an opera house in the south of this early battleground state, before some 340 attendees at a town hall-style meeting. \u201cHow do we create a high-growth strategy so that people can be lifted up again?\u201d he added. \u201cI know how it\u2019s done, because I\u2019ve done it. I did it as governor. I cut taxes every year. I reduced the government workforce by 13,000 \u2013 that\u2019s kind of hard to do, but I did it by reforming how government works.\u201d Despite a rocky build-up to the formal launch of his campaign \u2013 including staff changes, uncertainty over meeting his own lofty fundraising goals, and the ghost of his brother\u2019s Iraq war \u2013 Bush appeared poised, relaxed and jovial. Sporting a light blue button-up shirt, rolled up at the sleeves, he even cracked jokes at the expense of George W Bush while selling his managerial experience. \u201cIf you ever see my good friend Rick Perry or even my brother, George W, tell them we created more jobs in Florida,\u201d Bush said, drawing laughter from the crowd. At times the younger Bush sounded a lot like Perry, the former Texas governor who is seeking the Republican nomination once again after a failed bid in 2012. Perry has spent recent months taking swipes at a group of first-term Republican senators running for president, calling for \u201cless talking and more doing\u201d. Bush struck a similar tone on Tuesday, pointing out there were \u201ca lot of people that are really good at talking\u201d in the ever-growing Republican field. (Billionaire Donald Trump joined moments before Bush took the stage.) \u201cI didn\u2019t file an amendment and call that success. I actually did things as governor,\u201d said Bush, whose rivals include a man he once mentored \u2013 Florida senator Marco Rubio. Bush and Rubio have insisted they remain good friends, although Bush acknowledged in an interview with Fox News before the town hall that it was \u201ca little awkward\u201d to be running against each other. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the way it is. He\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Bush said. After brief remarks, Bush spent nearly an hour answering a wide range of questions \u2013 16 in total \u2013 at length and with a willingness to be candid if necessary. Bush told one woman concerned about the growing influence of money in politics that he would not support the idea of providing a tax credit for small-dollar political donations. Unlike many of his Republican opponents, Bush noticeably did not spend much time criticizing Obama \u2013 choosing instead to promote his own self-described \u201cprovocative\u201d ideas for reforming the tax code and peeling back government regulations. His biggest critique of the current administration was in response to a question on how to stop Isis militants. \u201cThis president has literally said twice in the last year that we don\u2019t have a strategy. Really? Well, who\u2019s supposed to be in charge? That\u2019s what presidents do: presidents create strategies,\u201d Bush said, calling the emergence of Isis \u201ca long-haul threat\u201d that would require the US to be engaged in Iraq and Syria \u2013 although not combat troops, he was quick to note. Bush was also asked about a threat of an entirely different nature: climate change, namely Pope Francis\u2019s upcoming encyclical on the issue. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don\u2019t get economic policy from bishops or my cardinals or my pope,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm,\u201d he said, while adding that \u201cthe climate is changing, whether men are doing it or not\u201d. The response resonated well with Ernst Kastning, a 71-year-old retired geologist who attended the town hall and told the Guardian after that he was impressed by what he heard. \u201cAs a geologist, I\u2019m very concerned about the global climate issue. The other candidates see it as a battle between the Environmental Protection Agency and business,\u201d said Kastning, who said he was pleased to see Bush showing up with more than an anti-Obama pitch. \u201cI think a lot of the other candidates right now are getting sound bites. They\u2019re grandstanding, they\u2019re grousing about what Obama has not done,\u201d he said. \u201c[Bush] did a little of that, but that\u2019s natural. I favor a candidate that\u2019s willing to talk about getting things done with the other side \u2026 I heard details here that really impressed me \u2013 specifics.\u201d New Hampshire is known for voters like Kastning \u2013 pragmatic and independent-minded, to the point that license plates on cars here bear the state\u2019s \u201cLive Free or Die!\u201d motto. It\u2019s precisely why political watchers say Bush, a candidate who has cautiously tested the waters in these early primary stages without doling out much red meat to conservatives, could do well if he sticks to a more conciliatory tone. The issue of same-sex marriage proved to be one such tricky area, twice emerging as a topic of discussion during Bush\u2019s visit. He was first pressed on the subject during a pre-taped interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity ahead of the town hall \u2013 and ahead of a US supreme court decision expected this month that could legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. \u201cI believe in traditional marriage. I hope the supreme court rules that way,\u201d Bush said, while adding that Americans should not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. An audience member later asked Bush about so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws, which sparked controversy in Indiana and Arkansas earlier this year and saw the former governor then struggling to stake out a clear position. \u201cIt got ugly because the world is ugly today. It\u2019s really hard to have a deeper conversation in the public square these days,\u201d Bush said of the national outcry after Indiana passed a law that opponents said effectively allowed businesses to refuse services to LGBT individuals. \u201cI think we can protect religious freedom and not create a society that is intolerant ... I think that we\u2019re a big enough country, a tolerant enough country, to allow for both to exist.\u201d Bush is scheduled to visit other key early voting states this week, including Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, is also on a swing through the same states this week and stopped in New Hampshire on Monday. Bush did not mention Clinton during his remarks at the town hall, but sharply criticized the former secretary of state\u2019s foreign policy record during the interview with Hannity as \u201ca complete failure\u201d. Pointing again to his experience at the helm of Florida, Bush said: \u201cI\u2019d put that record up against Hillary Clinton\u2019s any day of the week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
