O'Neill was a historic appointment at Leicester. They were promoted in his first season, got to three League Cup finals and had a wonderful habit of outdoing richer and more illustrious opponents. Except the man behind it, revered as the finest manager the club has ever employed, never quite forgot what happened in his first couple of months before everything clicked into place, when the results were poor and letters arrived telling him he was everything from useless to worse. He kept them in a drawer at the training ground in Belvoir Drive and every so often, in the weeks after Leicester's promotion, he would reach in, pull one out and look up the telephone number. \"Is that John Smith?\" \"Yes.\" \"Martin O'Neill here.\" Pause. \"You wrote me a letter and you called me this and that and said I couldn't do the job properly.\" Pause. \"So I thought I'd ring you and ask what your thoughts are now.\" The story feels relevant now, as O'Neill reaches his first anniversary as Sunderland manager, because it is probably the only other time in his managerial career, albeit briefly, when his club has been in a really difficult patch. As it turned out, Leicester went from being a middling second-tier club to one that had four successive top-10 finishes in the Premier League under his watch. At Celtic there were three Scottish titles and four cups, making him their most successful manager since Jock Stein. O'Neill was shortlisted for the England job in 2006 and, looking back, would almost certainly have made a better fist of it than Steve McClaren. At one point he was routinely talked about as the best candidate to take over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. But Ferguson stayed and O'Neill went to Aston Villa, where there were three sixth-placed finishes in a row. What's gone wrong at Sunderland is not easy to know. Something, though, clearly has since that initial three-month burst after his appointment, a year ago on Monday, when a losing club became a winning one and O'Neill seemed to energise the whole place. He is approaching his first anniversary on a run of two wins from 21 league games \u2013 13 this season, eight last season \u2013 going into Sunday's match at Norwich City, one of his former clubs. The wins came against a Fulham side for whom Brede Hangeland was sent off after half an hour and a Wigan Athletic team who lost Jordi G\u00f3mez to a red card three minutes into the second half. Eleven versus 11, Sunderland have not beaten anyone in the league since winning 1-0 against Liverpool on 10 March. Throw in a Capital One Cup defeat at home to Middlesbrough and it amounts to the least distinguished run of O'Neill's time as a top-flight manager. Opta's statistics show that in Europe's top five leagues only Siena have managed as few shots on target this season. Both teams have 36. The tendency when it is a manager of this distinction is to believe it will pass and certainly there is a sense here that, with time, Sunderland will get it right under his direction. All the same, a blip has become a slump and at the Stadium of Light on Tuesday, watching a fairly dismal 0-0 draw with QPR, Sunderland didn't feel like a team with only minor issues to tweak here and there. The crowd were restless and the players seemed utterly bereft of imagination or ideas. More than anything, you would not have associated this group of footballers \u2013 flat, uninspired, lacking belief \u2013 with a manager whose players have given the impression in the past they would walk through a barbed-wire fence for him. It is 12 years since O'Neill's last win at Wembley with Leicester and nine since he took Celtic to the Uefa Cup final. The question, I guess, is whether he can still motivate a team the way he used to. Yet it is asked with a fairly significant amount of caution by someone who worked in the Midlands during his reign at Leicester and has seen, close up, the inspirational effect he can have on players, the charisma of the man and sheer force of personality. One thing for certain is that O'Neill \u2013 an old line is that the O stands for \"obstinate\" \u2013 is unlikely to appreciate anyone suggesting he needs to reinvent himself. More likely, Sunderland are flirting with the relegation places because of a combination of different reasons, starting with the fact that three of O'Neill's more inventive players have been afflicted by losses of confidence to varying degrees. St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon's return to form has been a slow process. James McClean has drifted out of the team and, though it's still early days, Adam Johnson has flickered only sporadically since his \u00a310m signing from Manchester City. Johnson is a talented player but the suspicion at City was that he was too fond of a night out. Steven Fletcher's form at least reminds us of O'Neill's ability to make good players even better players. With time, it might turn out that his restorative powers turn Johnson into the attacking winger everyone wants him to be as well. O'Neill still has two-thirds of the season, so let's not rush into judgment when we are talking about someone with eight manager-of-the month awards in English football, plus a further nine in Scotland, where he also won three manager-of-the-year titles. O'Neill is 60, but it is a young 60. He has shown enough in the past to warrant more patience and understanding than the average manager and, barring a silly internet rumour about him resigning last weekend, it's pleasing that there has been absolutely no conjecture about his job. O'Neill, for his part, has talked about his players suffering a lack of self-belief and maintained all along that he, and they, will turn it around. Sunderland's form, though, is alarming. O'Neill has been celebrated throughout his managerial life, going all the way back to Grantham Town, but football is full of examples of accomplished managers who have known little but success but encountered difficulties at one club. Sam Allardyce has invigorated Notts County, Bolton Wanderers and West Ham but had a bad time at Newcastle. Harry Redknapp can cherish memories from Bournemouth, West Ham, Portsmouth and Spurs but must wince about what happened at Southampton. Marcello Lippi won five Serie A titles and the Champions League with Juventus and took Italy to a World Cup final but also had an unhappily short stint at Internazionale. Everyone remembers Brian Clough's 44 days at Leeds United but his spell at Brighton wasn't too clever either, with 12 wins from 32 games. It happens, and nobody is immune just because they have excelled in the past. Sinclair's struggles on City fringes should be a warning to Sterling Early days, perhaps, but it is difficult not to look at Scott Sinclair's impact at Manchester City and wonder when it is going to get any better. There are not too many players who would turn down the chance to leave a mid-table club, albeit an upwardly mobile one, to join the Premier League champions, especially one with City's salary structure. Yet it always felt strange that a club of City's ambitions, fresh from winning the league, would identify Sinclair among their priority summer signings and the initial scepticism has not been lifted by his contribution since arriving from Swansea. It amounts to two Premier League starts on successive weekends in September. He was substituted at half-time in the second of them and has played 15 minutes of league football in the past two months. In the Champions League, he has not featured. What has happened to Sinclair should be a warning to Raheem Sterling, currently prevaricating over a new deal at Liverpool, about how a potential buyer might offer better money but not have space for him in the team. Sterling is a mandatory first-team player at Anfield these days and that cannot be overstated when there is a World Cup coming up in 18 months. Go somewhere else, where the competition is stronger, and he might just blow his chance of going to Brazil. The difference is that Sterling is 17 whereas Sinclair, at 23, is at an age when he should be nailing down a first-team place, or at least getting closer than he is. It is never good when a footballer is better known because his girlfriend is on reality television rather than anything he is doing himself. Managers' passport to protesting too much Over the next few weeks we are going to hear an awful lot of managers complaining about losing players to the Africa Cup of Nations. Roberto Mancini has already set the ball rolling by suggesting that Yaya Tour\u00e9, his brother Kolo and Abdul Razak, a 20-year-old fringe player, should opt out of representing the Ivory Coast in the tournament, to be held in South Africa from 19 January to 10 February. Prepare for other managers to say the same, placing their players in the same invidious position. On the one hand, it is easy to understand why managers get so frustrated with a three-week competition in the middle of the season and, yes, that exasperation is going to be exacerbated by the fact it is only a year since the last tournament. On the other hand, it is hardly news that they were bringing the event forward by a year to avoid clashing with the 2014 World Cup. For anyone who wants to denigrate the competition as a second-rate event, please also note it has been held since 1957, which makes it older and more established than the European Championship. Clubs naturally don't want to lose out but presumably they did consider the passports of their players when signing them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
