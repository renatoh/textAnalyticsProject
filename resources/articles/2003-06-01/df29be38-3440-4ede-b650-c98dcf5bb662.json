In a well-choreographed PR move, Posh and Becks are to appear on the Tonight show, a programme that can make or break a UK star's attempts to become King or Queen of America. The show's influence is difficult to underestimate. One survey recently suggested that 60 per cent of Americans get their news from the monologues the hosts like Leno deliver at the start of their shows. The Beckhams have had one stab at introducing themselves to US audiences. In April, Posh told ABC chat show host Deborah Roberts of her kidnap fears for son Brooklyn while her husband talked about the pressures of celebrity. ABC introduced the pair as the 'hottest couple in the western hemisphere'. This time, though, the stakes are much higher. Hit it off with Tonight 's influential host, the comedian Jay Leno, and they will be the talk of the Hamptons. Just ask Robbie Williams. The UK singer (or at least his record company, EMI) is desperate to break America with his new album, Escapology, and has run the gamut of chat shows from east to west coast. The singer's most recent appearance, on NBC's Tonight last week, is still the talk of American broadcasting. Williams proceeded to 'lap dance' Pop Idol judge Simon Cowell before trying to rub himself against stand-in presenter Katie Couric and kiss actor Mike Myers. 'On American TV they have a much straighter view of sex. That will get him noticed. It could be the springboard to launch his career into overdrive,' said Richard Woolfe, controller of Living TV, whose cable channel FTN broadcasts the Tonight show on week nights in the UK. Rick Cotton, president of CNBC Europe, which screens Tonight at weekends, agrees. 'It is the longest-running late night talk show, part of the fabric of American society. British celebrities who want to break into the US market, want to be part of the \"Leno\" scene.' Last month it was the turn of Nigella Lawson, who won over Leno with a cooking lesson live on air. Her appearance was in marked contrast with the cooler reception afforded rival Jamie Oliver when he appeared a week later. It transpires that Leno, who took over from legendary host Johnny Carson and is now in his eleventh year fronting the hour-long programme, is something of an Anglophile. The man who once said there were only 18 people worth interviewing in the world prefers them to be British. 'English guests are the best. They know how to talk,' he once said. It was Leno's famous interview with Hugh Grant in 1995 - shortly after the star was arrested on vice charges - that proved the making of him. Back then, NBC executives were calling for Leno's head. The Grant interview possibly saved Leno's career. 'We got such a big audience that we could have stayed off the air for the rest of the week and still won the ratings,' Leno recalls. Since then everyone from Tom Cruise to Britney have beaten a path to the show. These days Leno's figures usually eclipse arch rival David Letterman's Late Night Show on CBS. As of 8 May, Tonight had beaten the Late Show 160 out of the last 162 weeks. According to Nielsen Media Research, Leno sucked in a nightly average of 6 million viewers aged 18 to 49 in the last week of April. Letterman managed 3.8 million. Given the fragmented nature of US television audiences, these are big figures, and inevitably the networks constantly try to poach each other's chat show stars. Two years ago, executives from Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network tried to steal NBC's cerebral late night host Conan O'Brien, whose show report edly brings in $70m worth of revenues for the network each year. Fox was reported to have offered O'Brien up to $20m a year ($8m more than Leno is reputedly paid) to switch networks and move to an earlier time slot. Then there was talk of interest from CBS, when Letterman looked like he was heading for the door. Both deals came to nothing and O'Brien, like Leno, is now approaching his eleventh year in the job. Given their status it is seismic when a host defects. O'Brien uses a railway analogy: 'You've got to have a really good reason for stopping one, building a track somewhere else, lifting it up with giant winches and then trying to get it going in a different direction.' Posh and Becks may think they're big, but wait till they meet Leno. He owns 160 classic cars and motorbikes..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
