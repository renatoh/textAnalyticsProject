The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats condemned the appointment of Finsbury Ltd to shore up City support for the government's plan to make Railtrack a non-profit trust. The London agency was hired by the City bank Schroders, financial advisers to Ernst and Young, appointed by the government to put Railtrack into administration. The Tory party chairman, David Davis, called on the transport secretary, Stephen Byers, to answer to Parliament. \"Taxpayers will be outraged that they appear to have to pay twice to make up for the shamed spin doctor's inability to do her job,\" he said. Ms Moore, press adviser to Mr Byers, this week publicly apologised for urging colleagues to use the New York attacks to \"bury\" bad news. She continues to draw her salary, while Finsbury Ltd will be paid by Schroders out of its fee for assembling a rail rescue plan - underlining suggestions that she is a lame duck who can no longer perform her media function."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
