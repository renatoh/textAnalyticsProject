He will have keyhole surgery tomorrow to assess the extent of the damage having already been ruled out for between four and six weeks. \"If the examination reveals clinical instability, then the plan will be to repair the ligament at that time, which would be likely to sideline Gavin for 12 weeks,\" said the region's physiotherapist, Chris Towers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
