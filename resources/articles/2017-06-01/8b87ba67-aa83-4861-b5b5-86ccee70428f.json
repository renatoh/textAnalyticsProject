The artwork, on the side of 309 George St in Sydney, is a 50m-high and 30m-wide woman with flowers behind her ears, holding a giant waratah \u2013 the floral emblem of New South Wales \u2013 and the word \u201cOBEY\u201d. The artist\u2019s largest work, which will take around 400 cans of spray paint to complete, it\u2019s immediately recognisable as belonging to the same family of the widely popular political posters: the Hope poster that was widely visible through Barack Obama\u2019s campaign and the image prominent through the Trump resistance: We The People. Fairey, who designed those images, has had an eclectic career jumping between DJing, street art, activism, design and corporate consulting. He\u2019s now in Sydney for Vivid, unveiling the CBD mural and giving a talk on Saturday: \u201cI\u2019m talking about my entire art practice but emphasising DIY movements \u2013 punk rock, street art and skateboarding,\u201d he says. Fairey is a descendant not just of 1980s street art and skateboarding culture but of the ironic conceptual art of Marcel Duchamp. It was the Hope posters that made Fairey\u2019s name as a political artist and brought him to the attention of a mass audience \u2013 but as Obama progressed into his presidency, and began to make compromises, the association lost its gloss. In 2010, The Colbert Report\u2019s Stephen Colbert interviewed Fairey and asked: \u201cHow\u2019s that \u2018Hope\u2019 working out for you now?\u201d Ten years on from those posters, Fairey has a less idealistic view of the president. \u201cThere were things I admire about Obama and things I\u2019m disappointed in \u2013 such as drone strikes. I\u2019m unhappy that he didn\u2019t dismantle the surveillance state and he defended domestic spying. But there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s going to be perfect.\u201d Fairey is still passionate about politics from a grassroots level, which he says is needed now more than ever under the Trump administration. He highlights \u201cthe scapegoating of Muslims and the corporatisation of US politics \u2013 and the need for finance reform\u201d as issues that concern him. But he\u2019s buoyed by the resurgence of activism in America. \u201cOne of the things that was always great about grassroots movements is like-minded people finding each other. Look at the Occupy movement and the belief that a small group of people can provide family for each other, and do good in the world. Right now in the US there\u2019s a lot of cynicism, a lot of people are failing to connect.\u201d Fairey wants people to \u201cstart conversations with different people and explore different strategies for change,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not hopeless.\u201d Shepard Fairey will speak at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday 17 June, the same day he finishes his mural at 309 George Street, Sydney. An exhibition of his works at Darling Quarter closes 17 June at Darling Quarter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
