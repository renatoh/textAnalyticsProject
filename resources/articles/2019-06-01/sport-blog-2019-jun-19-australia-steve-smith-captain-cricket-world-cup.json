Of deep green with a gold Southern Cross on the bill, the cap would also sport four gold letters. MSCA: Make Smith Captain Again. Bad idea, you say? No, Brexit is a bad idea. This government is a bad idea. A particularly bad idea is the Hundred, harrumph. But reinstating Steve Smith as Australia\u2019s captain makes compelling sense. It\u2019s about time cricket grew up. A year ago, at a press conference during the third Test against South Africa, Smith admitted his leadership was poor in the ball-tampering fiasco but was adamant he should keep the captaincy. \u201cI still think I\u2019m the right person for the job,\u201d he said. \u201cI take responsibility as the captain, I need to take control of the ship, but this is certainly something I\u2019m not proud of and something that I can hopefully learn from and come back strong from. I am embarrassed to be sitting here talking about this.\u201d Cape Town embarrassment became Sydney shame five days later when Smith imploded before the Australian media. There was also a teary Cameron Bancroft, a teary David Warner, a teary Darren Lehmann, three lengthy bans and a resignation. At which point all this nonsense should have stopped. But no. There were countless thousands of words in a lamentable bonfire of media piety, best captured by Andy Bull: \u201cThere have been bigger scandals but you would not know it from the fallout. No one died, no one doped, no one fixed, hell, no one even managed to cheat ... If the truth is a casualty of war, a sense of proportion is a casualty of sport.\u201d It\u2019s even tempting to wonder when Terrence Malick will film the sorry mess: Guy Pearce whispering incoherently over pitiful scenes of weepy players and tut-tutting hacks. Now, a year later, comes redemption. Apparently. Smith is back in the Australian fold along with Warner, his former deputy. And spectators have greeted them with boos and shouts of \u201cCheat!\u201d \u2013 well done everyone. Smith has dismissed the jeers as \u201cwater off a duck\u2019s back\u201d but that\u2019s not the point. It shouldn\u2019t happen. It mocks the spirit of cricket. And one international captain is inclined to agree. There was a moment at the Oval in the World Cup match between India and Australia when Virat Kohli urged supporters of his team to applaud rather than jeer Smith, then during a change between overs shook hands with his former Test counterpart. Kohli said later it was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d for fans to boo Smith. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened has happened,\u201d the India captain said. \u201cEveryone has known that. He\u2019s come back. He\u2019s worked hard. He\u2019s playing well for his side now.\u201d Well said, sir. Smith is a cricketer, not a criminal; he broke the Laws, not the law. So yes, apologise and do the time. But then return without a tugged forelock to any crowd dabbling in mental disintegration \u2013 the very thing for which Australian cricket teams of yore have been slated. Which brings us to the captaincy. I\u2019ve nothing against Aaron Finch or Tim Paine \u2013 doubtless they\u2019re sterling chaps and Finch is a superb batsman \u2013 but when there\u2019s a fellow back in the team who has been described as the new Don Bradman, then have him lead the side with the clear message: follow me, lads. Humorists might offer directions to the nearest hardware store, but there\u2019ll be rough justice everywhere. Accusations will be fired each time an Australian player so much as reaches into his pockets to warm his hands. So fire back, from the hip. This new, softer Baggy Green isn\u2019t convincing. To a mug\u2019s eye the players look muddled. They dispatched Sri Lanka and Pakistan last week, but not without some ropey middle-order batting and the lethal sting of Mitchell Starc. That followed their curious run chase against India at the Oval: pedestrian, confused, doomed. India won by 36 runs: Warner faced 48 dot balls. Smith was bumped up to No 3. Usman Khawaja, so effective when filling in as an opener during Warner\u2019s ban, struggled at No 4, scored 10 at No 3 against Sri Lanka and, in the Pakistan game, found himself at No 6. Call me a pundit (shudder), but why not restore Khawaja as opener, slot Warner in at three and Smith at four? Whatever they thought they were doing against India did not work, and hints at a philosophical flaw. Australia have lost their mongrel mojo. By burying their natural joie de niggle they\u2019ve managed to lose their bluster and with it an air of invincibility. It\u2019s time they found it again. Hand-wringers in the game might chunter and tie themselves in knots, but the ocker swagger works. None of this is to say Australia won\u2019t win the World Cup (they will) or should return to the alpha male doctrine of winning at all costs. But the Ashes are far from safe, though Paine may disagree. Smith is banned from any leadership role until next year, but oh let\u2019s have some fun. Imagine the boos of faux moral outrage at an Australian Test side led once more by a chap caught out for ball carpentry. Splendid. Do it. Defiance is a powerful force in a team and Australians are steeped in historical fury. Kick out the jams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
