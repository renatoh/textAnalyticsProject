There is plenty of time to mull over such non-pressing issues as the secret diet and exercise regimes that gift the rich and famous with such extraordinary leanness as you watch the first episode of The First, because almost nothing happens in the first episode of The First. We are some time in the near future. The clothes and cars look the same, but everything is voice activated by software that actually works. Tom is a seasoned astronaut due to captain Earth\u2019s first manned mission to Mars but who is stood down at the last minute by his boss, a visionary aerospace lady magnate, Laz Ingram (Natascha McElhone). We pause here for a couple more mullable thoughts. One: I am glad to see that someone in the near future has finally figured out what to do with McElhone\u2019s fringe. It has been a distraction ever since The Truman Show and at times has threatened to require separate billing. Hairstylists of 2030-ish, I salute you. Two: is the fact that Ingram is northern an intriguing clue to something \u2013 does the Cheshire town Prestbury, in the next 12 or so years, in an unforeseen twist of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit fate, become some kind of aeronautical powerhouse? Or has all of the UK fled to the land of opportunity because, in a more foreseen non-twist of our post-Brexit fate, we become an uninhabitable bin fire of a nation? Or is this McElhone\u2019s deliberate character choice? Does she think, as a Surrey girl, that all northerners are as emotionally awkward and socially gauche as the icy CEO Ingram is? Three: is it an absolutely unbreakable law that an astronaut being stood down at the last minute means he will shortly be watching the flight he would have been on explode beautifully against a clear blue sky? And that the family and friends gathered on the bleacher below watch helplessly as triumph turns \u2013 in a matter of moments \u2013 to tragedy and the realisation that we are all as flies to the wanton gods is seared for ever into their souls? The crew gathers slowly in the rocket\u2019s front bit. They banter in a way that reveals them to be a fun yet close yet respectful group of sensitive yet hyperintelligent and now surely doomed buddies. Then Tom puts the final narrative nail in their pressurised coffin by calling them to tell them they are the best crew \u2013 fun, you know? Yet close, yet respectful, and so sensitive! \u2013 the mission could have and wish them well. Yeah, they explode against an azure sky. Quietly, and almost incidentally. Ain\u2019t no one going to Mars this episode. Tom leaps into action, heading down to the launch (he was at home watching it on television in order to contain his fatless feelings about being dumped) and clears the party room of its balloons and streamers so the families have somewhere to gather that doesn\u2019t feel like it is taking the piss. He is there to greet the bereaved with hugs when they come in from the bleachers. Because he is the very goodest of guys, capiche? In vain does he try to teach Ingram some of his warm, American, good-guy ways, but she Cannot Hug and Will Not Learn. However, her icy demeanour (\u00a9 TV lady magnates everywhere) hides turmoil in her breast; she tries to get her near-future car to drive over her but its inbuilt safety mechanism prevents it. And they call it progress! Pause for thought again \u2013 have they called her Laz to echo Lazarus, as a new mission to Mars is planned? Really? Meanwhile, Tom goes home and takes a razor to his beard of self-pity with the aid of some Deepening Resolution shaving foam and sets his jaw in preparation for whatever the rest of the series has in store for him; an agglomeration of slickly executed, gloriously uninvolving scenes he will continue to phone in, or a gradual evolution into an ensemble character piece that uses all the talent involved, who presumably didn\u2019t sign up to remain ciphers throughout? Whichever it is, it will now involve the junkie daughter who turns up in the closing minutes. Tom holds her hair back while she is sick, then goes out for a run while he cries.
