White said: \"I'm looking to try to anchor my place in the England team and there's only one place to do that and that's Leicester. I'm 30 now and I want to play some decent rugby, get some top coaching and improve myself. \"Tigers are a very organised unit. I'm sorry to leave Bristol and have had some good times there but I'm really looking forward to the challenge of playing at a big successful club like Leicester.\" Leicester's director of rugby Dean Richards said: \"Julian has been recognised as being one of the strongest scrummagers in Europe if not the world. He is just the kind of player we need to strengthen our squad for next season.\" Contepomi has secured a four-year deal with the Heineken Cup semi-finalists. It is not the first time that Leinster have looked to acquire the 25-year-old; they made a move for the Argentinian after the 1999 World Cup. The Saracens prop Mike Storey tonight faces a charge of stamping against Newcastle this month, knowing that a ban would put him out of Saturday week's wild-card final against Leicester, a match for which the England flanker Richard Hill will be fit after fears that he had damaged ankle ligaments against Leeds were allayed yesterday by a scan. Richards, meanwhile, has questioned the purpose of today's England squad gathering before next weekend's Barbarians match. \"I don't know why but Clive [Woodward] has called an England training session on Tuesday,\" he said. \"Whether that is part of the agreement [between Premier Rugby and the Rugby Football Union] or not, it is a strange time to call it. Then there is England's game against the Barbarians, which two of our boys are involved in. Really they could have done with the rest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
