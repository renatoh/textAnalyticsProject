In a speech at the conference Healey signalled the party would extend the idea that it would differentiate between good and bad companies \u2013 opening a new front with the coalition over which firms were fit to run public services. He announced that a future Labour administration would have new powers to regulate for \"best business practices\" in care providers \u2013 and castigated the \"predatory fund managers who saw elderly people as commodities\" that had led to the collapse of Southern Cross, the biggest care home operator. Sources close to Healey said that a Labour government would favour charities and companies which could demonstrate a track record in health and \"a social ethos underpinning how they are run and organised\". Experts said it would not be easy to differentiate between providers. \"You have some very good investor-owned companies with a very strong orientation on patients and some very inefficient mutual organisations which do not,\" said Chris Ham of the King's Fund. Labour would also aim to integrate parts of the health service \u2013 bringing together GPs, hospitals and social care under one organisation \u2013 underlining the party's message that the coalition's plans would break up the health service and force different bits of the health service to compete with each other. Ham said this was a significant advance as \"international evidence suggests that this offers the most promising approach to providing co-ordinated care for the increasing number of patients with long-term conditions\". Healey said that there was \"extra pressure to make short term cuts\" in the NHS, a claim that appears to be borne out by the first assessment by the regulator of how the NHS is coping since it entered the four-year period of cutting \u00a320bn from budgets in April 2011. Monitor, the economic regulator central to health secretary Andrew Lansley's reforms which oversees 137 foundation trusts, warned that in the first three months of the new financial constraints there had been \"an increase in the number of trusts facing financial risk and subject to regulatory scrutiny\". It said that were 29 hospital trusts that had failed to meet a key cancer target, where patients are supposed to see a clinician within 62 days. Given how important cancer is to the electorate this will ring alarm bells. According to the regulator the failure of several key trusts, especially in Manchester where the leading Christie NHS Foundation Trust has \"persistently failed to meet the 62-day cancer waiting time target\", was \"unacceptable\". Sue Slipman, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network, warned that foundation trusts were being asked to make unprecedented savings. She said: \"There are also deep concerns that \u2026 high winter demand creates additional pressures far above the current demand levels and these remain subject to marginal cost reimbursement of 30%; we could end up in perfect storm conditions.\" Adding to the concerns about the cuts Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said \"this is further evidence that pressures are mounting across the NHS. By far the biggest problem the NHS is facing is the \u00a320billion of efficiency savings we need to find by 2015. This is a problem we cannot ignore.\" The savings could, claim experts, \"determine the outcome of the next election\". Policy consultants MHP Health Mandate revealed that 21 struggling NHS trusts would be located in marginal constituencies at the next election following a review of constituency boundaries. Of the 21 trusts, seven have been identified as being \"at risk\" by the Department of Health as a result of a PFI scheme. MPs whose marginal seats will be influenced by debates over the future of these trusts include the health minister, Lib Dem Paul Burstow, former Labour health secretary Alan Johnson, Labour shadow health minister Liz Kendall and Tory Nick de Bois in north London. Mike Birtwistle, Managing Director of MHP Health Mandate, said: \"The NHS is going to face incredibly tough decisions on hospital closures in the coming years. There are strong quality and efficiency arguments for closing some services, but doing so will be a huge test of political nerve. With the opinion polls continuing to be close, the fate of these 21 trusts \u2013 and the way in which the NHS engages with local communities about them \u2013 could determine the outcome of the next election.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
