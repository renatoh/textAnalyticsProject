Also there was the debonair Frenchman Alec Head, who rode Le Paillon into second place in the 1947 race and then went on to become one of the great Flat trainers. Head had a few words for the anglais who have been making unflattering remarks about the French jockeys riding at Prestbury Park this week. \"All our riders will do their very best,\" said Head. \"And I'm sure all British ex-jockeys and trainers still believe they always did their best when riding at Longchamp, Chantilly and Auteuil.\" Touch\u00e9. \u00b7 The franc is no more, ditto the Irish punt, but the Tote was keeping an arm's-length approach to this filthy euro lucre. The Nanny advised that Irish or French punters wishing to bet in their new currency should hand in euros and receive Tote betting vouchers in exchange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
