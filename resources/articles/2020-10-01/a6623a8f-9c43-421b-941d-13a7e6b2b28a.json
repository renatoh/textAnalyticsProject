Before we go, here\u2019s a quick summary of everything that\u2019s happened today: Donald Trump has started to say that he is \u201cimmune\u201d to Covid-19 after contracting the virus, contradicting evidence that people can get the virus more than once and ignoring the lack of research about how long antibodies are effective. Twitter flagged Trump\u2019s tweet that claims he\u2019s immune to the virus, saying that it contains misleading information. Dr Anthony Fauci spoke out against a Trump campaign ad that took praise he gave for the coronavirus task force out of context. In the rare pushback to Trump, Fauci said that the GOP did not get his permission to use the clip and reiterated that he has never publicly endorsed any political candidates \u201cin my nearly five decades of public service\u201d. The opening statement Amy Coney Barrett, the supreme court nominee whose nomination process will start in the Senate tomorrow, has been leaked and reveals Barrett will say that she would apply the \u201claw as written\u201d and speak about the influence of the late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia on her judicial philosophy. A new national poll from ABC News and the Washington Post shows Joe Biden maintaining a large lead over Donald Trump, with Biden holding a 12% lead over the incumbent just three weeks until the presidential election. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has spoken out against Donald Trump taking a clip out of context for a campaign ad, what is now one of Fauci\u2019s most direct pushback against Trump since the start of the pandemic. For months during the course of the pandemic, Donald Trump has often been at odds with Fauci, delivering contradictory public health messages and publicly expressing frustration with the doctor\u2019s more sober take on the pandemic. In the spring, as the virus ravaged the Northeast of the country, Fauci was a regular at the White House\u2019s coronavirus press briefings. But in June, Fauci said he was not invited to the press briefings, with Trump telling Fox News that \u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s a nice man, but he made a lot of mistakes\u201d. At the time, cases were just starting to rise in many parts of the country, the effects of states quickly reopening their economies for the summer, allowing the virus to spread. Fauci at the time cautioned against reopening without regulations in place, contradicting Trump\u2019s messaging that states should rush to reopen. Fauci has done his best to be a neutral, authoritative public health figure over the course of the pandemic, opting to do dozens of virtual interviews to offer his recommendations to Americans. Trump has since replaced Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, another respected epidemiologist who was once a regular at the White House press briefing, with Dr Scott Atlas, who has come under scrutiny by public health experts for questioning the effectiveness of masks and parroting the Trump administration\u2019s optimistic timeline for a Covid-19 vaccine. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign responded to a new statement from Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, who said his words were taken out of context for a new Trump ad. \u201cThese are Dr. Facui\u2019s own words. The video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr. Fauci was praising the work of the Trump administration,\u201d said Trump\u2019s communication director Tim Murtaugh. \u201cThe words are accurate and directly from Dr. Fauci\u2019s mouth.\u201d The statement of course does not address that Fauci, when he said \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2026 anyone could be doing more\u201d was not referring to Trump but the broader coronavirus task force, including himself. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, responded to his misleading appearance in a new ad for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, saying that he was taken out of context by the spot. In the ad, released yesterday, Fauci can be heard saying \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2026 anyone could be doing more\u201d in an interview as the ad boasts Trump\u2019s response to Covid-19. The clip came from an interview Fauci had with Fox News and was taken from a snippet when he was describing the work that he and other members of the coronavirus task force undertook to respond to the virus. Fauci was not directing his statement at Trump. \u201cIn my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,\u201d Fauci said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.\u201d The chief executive of Regeneron, the pharmaceutical company that produced the antibody cocktail that Donald Trump received to treat his case of Covid-19, said that Trump\u2019s experience with the drug is \u201ca case of one\u201d and said the company is working through clinical trials to ensure its safety and effectiveness. \u201cThe president is a case of one,\u201d Leonard Schleifer, chief executive of Regeneron, said in an interview with CBS today. \u201cIt is evidence of what\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s kind of the weakest evidence you can get.\u201d The company is likely trying to neutralize itself after falling into political discourse about the virus. Earlier this week, Trump in a video said that Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail was the key to his recovery from the virus, calling it a \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19 though the drug is still in clinical trials. Public health experts criticized the president for touting a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, something the president has done before with other unconfirmed treatments of the virus such as hydroxychloroquine and blood plasma. Jaime Harrison, who is running against Republican Lindsey Graham for his Senate seat representing South Carolina, has raised $57 million over the last three months \u2013 the largest haul in a single quarter for a Senate candidate in US history. The biggest quarterly haul for a Senate candidate was $38 million before Harrison set the new record, which was raised by former US representative Beto O\u2019Rourke in his election against Senator Ted Cruz, according to the New York Times. Graham has not yet announced his fundraising figure for the last quarter. Harrison is the former chair of the South Carolina\u2019s Democratic Party and associate chairman of the national Democratic Party. It looks like Twitter flagged Donald Trump\u2019s tweet about being immune to Covid-19. The platform has hid the Tweet completely under a message that says it violates Twitter\u2019s rules \u201cabout spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19\u201d. The note also says that Twitter \u201chas determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible\u201d. This appears to be the fifth Tweet of Trump\u2019s that the platform has flagged. The first was a Tweet from May when he said \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. One Tweet in June about using \u201cserious force\u201d against protesters and another in August that called mail boxes a \u201cvoter security disaster\u201d were both flagged. The fourth flagged tweet was from September when Trump encouraged voters in North Carolina to vote twice, which is illegal. On Friday, Twitter announced further limits on users who are trying to spread misinformation or encourage violence or election interference, including candidates for office. The platform said it would flag false claims of winning an election from candidates until state election officials or authoritative national news outlets report it. After talks over a new coronavirus stimulus package, which have been ongoing since July, the White House published an open letter to Congress that targets Democrats for taking \u201can all-or-nothing approach\u201d to talks. \u201cThe House has passed two separate partisan bills instead of compromising with us on bipartisan legislation like we have done in the past,\u201d the letter reads. Of course the letter does not mention that Senate Republicans have played a major role in holding up negotiations. House Democrats passed two different stimulus packages, the hefty $3 trillion HEROES Act in May and a $2.2 trillion at the beginning of the month. Republicans have put forth the $1 trillion HEALS Act in July. While both sides seem reluctant to budget, the White House has indicated that they are more willing to get closer to what Democrats want than Senate Republicans, offering House speaker Nancy Pelosi a $1.8 trillion plan on Friday. Pelosi\u2019s team indicated there was disagreement on the plan\u2019s Covid-19 public health response and overall funding level, meaning a bill is still not close in sight. Senate Republicans meanwhile have acknowledged that they are focused more on the nomination of judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that a bill will likely not be passed until after the election. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Tom Lutz. Senator Kamala Harris just announced that she will be participating in the confirmation hearing for judge Amy Coney Barrett remotely. The testimony in front of the Senate\u2019s judiciary committee is set to start tomorrow. Her Senate office said in a statement that the Republicans on the committee did not agree to agree to a request from Democrats, including Harris to implement a testing procedure. Two Republican members of the committee, senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah, both tested positive for the virus after attending the nominating ceremony for Barrett at the White House Sept. 25, which is considered a super-spreader event. Republicans have been eager to push Barrett\u2019s nomination through the Senate as quickly as possible before the election. On Twitter, Harris said that by moving forward with the hearing tomorrow, Senate Republicans were \u201cendangering the lives of not just members and our staff, but the hardworking people who keep the Senate complex running\u201d. Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has said Donald Trump\u2019s supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett should, if confirmed, step aside from contentious cases. Reuters reports: Democratic opposition to Barrett on policy issues has focused on her possible role in deciding a case before the Supreme Court in which Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) healthcare law, often called Obamacare. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t come unbiased and that\u2019s why she should recuse herself,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday. A key Obamacare provision that would be thrown out if the court strikes down the law bars insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats have criticized Trump for seeking to end Obamacare protections amid a pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. Schumer also said Barrett should recuse herself from any cases involving the presidential election because of statements made by Trump in which the president has said the court is likely to have election cases. Trump, who is running for reelection against Democrat Joe Biden, has indicated he would expect the court to rule in his favor if Barrett is confirmed. Donald Trump claims he is immune to Covid-19 \u2013 video When asked whether he still had Covid-19, the US president said he was now immune to the disease. Speaking on Fox News, he said he would be immune \u201cmaybe for a short time, maybe for a long time\u201d and that he was \u201cin very good shape\u201d. People who have had Covid-19 can be reinfected Donald Trump has announced his return from Covid-19 in a fundraising letter to supporters sent out on Sunday complete with lots of bolds and caps. I\u2019m back. I\u2019ve just been CLEARED by the White House doctor to return to the campaign trail. Amazing! I feel great - better than I have in the last 20 years - and I cannot wait to be back with the American People. The Democrats were hoping I would be out of commission for WEEKS. They wanted to keep me from YOU. They wanted to keep me from WINNING. Too bad for them - I AM BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER. So there you go, Donald Trump has the sculpted body of a 54-year-old. Amy Coney Barrett has said she will base her decisions on the law rather than her personal beliefs if, as expected, she is confirmed to the supreme court in the coming weeks. Barrett will deliver her remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, and The Hill obtained a copy of her statement. Barrett is a devout Catholic, who has a record of opposing abortion rights, something Democrats on the committee are expected to examine. Barrett cites her mentor and former supreme court justice, Antonin Scalia, in her statement. \u201cIt was the content of Justice Scalia\u2019s reasoning that shaped me,\u201d she is expected to say. \u201cHis judicial philosophy was straightforward: A judge must apply the law as written, not as the judge wishes it were. Sometimes that approach meant reaching results that he did not like.\u201d Barrett would replace liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month, giving conservatives on the court a 6-3 majority. \u201cI have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat, but no one will ever take her place,\u201d Barrett is expected to say. \u201cI will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led.\u201d For more on the role religion plays in the supreme court nomination, read our article below: A much debated topic since the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court is whether Democrats will \u201cpack\u201d the court should they win control of Congress and the White House. Such a move would see new (liberal) justices added to the court, making it more balanced between conservatives and liberals. During a Sunday morning appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, Joe Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond, refused to be drawn on whether such a plan was in the Democrats\u2019 playbook. \u201cI think that Joe Biden and Senator Harris are very clear, that it is a distraction [before November\u2019s election],\u201d said Richmond. \u201cWe should not be talking about a hypothetical court packing once this nominee is confirmed. When we\u2019re talking about packing, we\u2019re talking about all the judges that [Donald Trump] is packing on the court right now.\u201d Richmond added that Trump was responsible for court-packing himself. \u201cHe packed the appellate court, the circuit court, with 50 judges. But I bet you he didn\u2019t mention that to black or brown people yesterday at his White House rally, that out of 50 circuit court judges, he couldn\u2019t find one qualified black person to sit on the circuit court. So when you talk about court packing, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Richmond said. Biden himself has not given his position on packing. But Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Sunday that Biden was attempting a \u201cpower grab\u201d. \u201cThis [court packing] should be all the media\u2019s focused on,\u201d she said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cI understand you don\u2019t like Donald Trump. I understand [you] don\u2019t like Republicans. You have a Democrat running on the biggest power grab \u2013 the absolute biggest power grab in the history of our country and reshaping the United States of America and not answering the question. That\u2019s all we should be talking about.\u201d Arkansas\u2019 Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, says he supports Donald Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail after his Covid-19 diagnosis. He also rejected claims that safety measures at the president\u2019s rallies are not stringent enough. \u201cThey offer masks, they do screening whenever they come to the rallies, certainly we want to have an engagement in the presidential campaign this year,\u201d he told CNN on Sunday. Arkansas has seen a rise in Covid-19 cases, and Hutchinson it was important for people to take the correct precautions. \u201cA large part of it is simply the nature of the virus and if you don\u2019t take the right protections it\u2019s going to spread,\u201d Hutchinson said. That Lindsey Graham would become Donald Trump\u2019s poodle was not a tale (or tail) foretold. But it has landed him in the dogfight of his life for re-election to his Senate seat in South Carolina, challenged by a relentless and capable Democratic candidate, Jaime Harrison, who methodically chased Graham around the ring in their debate, repeatedly jabbing him as a hypocrite, until he struck him with a haymaker, ending the verbal fisticuffs with a TKO: \u201cBe a man.\u201d Bruised and battered, Graham retreated to his corner, Sean Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News, to beg: \u201cI\u2019m getting overwhelmed \u2026 help me, they\u2019re killing me money-wise. Help me.\u201d Graham has climbed the greasy pole within the Senate, to a position that historically has been rewarded by his state with a lifetime tenure. He succeeded to the seat that Strom Thurmond held for 48 years before he died at 100. From Graham\u2019s chairmanship of the Senate judiciary committee he has taken up the defense of Trump, to unmask the dastardly conspiracy of \u201cObamagate\u201d and to handle the confirmation of a justice on the supreme court, to pack it with a conservative majority for a generation to come. But just at this consummate moment of his career, events have conspired to dissolve his facade and expose his flagrant hypocrisy. His presumed strength has turned into his vulnerability. Worse, in Washington, where the press has treated him for more than 20 years like the genial star of the comedy club, he has become an object of ridicule. You can read the full article below: More from Trump\u2019s earlier interview on Fox News. He said some people believe he is doing a \u201cphenomenal\u201d job regarding Covid-19. Americans disagree, with a Washington Post/ABC News poll released on Sunday showing most Americans disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cOne is too many, but 2.2 million [deaths was the prediction as to how many people would die,\u201d Trump said, citing a study projecting fatalities if no measures against the virus were taken. \u201cWe lost 200,000 plus, and, you know, there are those that say we did a phenomenal job.\u201d Eric Trump has mounted a defence of his father\u2019s business dealings following new revelations in the New York Times. According to an article on Sunday in the Times headlined \u201cThe Swamp That Trump Built\u201d, Trump leveraged his position as president to bring revenue into his hotels and golf courses. However, in a appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, Eric Trump portrayed his father as a victim rather than an exploiter of the system. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a fortune, my father\u2019s lost a fortune running for president. He doesn\u2019t care, he wanted to do what was right. The last thing I can tell you Donald Trump needs in the world is this job. He wakes up in the morning and he has to fight you and he has to fight the entire media. He has to fight the democrats and he gets punched in the head every single day,\u201d said Eric Trump. The president\u2019s third child refused to address the allegations in the Times directly. \u201cGo Google Biden\u2019s house right now and tell me if you think that a person who\u2019s been in government for 47 years can afford that mansion, on the water in Wilmington, Delaware,\u201d he said. When pressed again, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re a hospitality company. We\u2019ve got tens of millions of people staying at our properties every single year. The New York Times is absolute fake news. All they want to do is take down my father.\u201d Host Maria Bartiromo ends the interview by asking Trump about an article in the Guardian that says the US defense department has created a taskforce to investigate UFOs. The president says he only learned of it two or three days ago but says he will \u201ccheck on that\u201d. Trump is asked about voter fraud. He says Democrats are \u201ctrying to steal the election\u201d. In fact, there is no evidence that voter fraud is a problem in the US. Trump, who has reportedly made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency, says that almost everything Joe Biden says \u201cis a lie\u201d. He says, without basis, that Biden wants to get of, among other things, guns, cars and fracking. He also says that Biden, a practicing Catholic, wants to get rid of God. Trump says he wants to roll out antibody cocktail Regeneron to hospitals. Regeneron was used to treat Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. \u201cWhat we have done in the last six or seven months [over therapeutics], no one else could have done. It could have taken years, and I got them to do it in weeks,\u201d says Trump. He then once again says \u201cI am immune\u201d to Covid-19. Asked about his general health, Trump says: \u201cI have no issues\u201d. Trump is asked about Nancy Pelosi and Democrats\u2019 proposals for a congressional commission to assess whether US presidents are capable of performing their duties or should be removed from office. He says, Pelosi is actually looking at replacing Joe Biden if he becomes president and putting into power Kamala Harris. \u201cThey want to put a super-left person in like Kamala Harris who is further left than Bernie Sanders,\u201d says Trump without basis of Harris who is definitely not to the left of Bernie Sanders. Donald Trump is on Fox News. He is asked if he still has Covid-19. \u201cI am immune,\u201d says the president. He says he will be immune \u201cmaybe for a short time, maybe for a long time\u201d. He adds: \u201cThe president is in very good shape\u201d. People who have had Covid-19, can in fact be reinfected. Regarding the event he held at the White House yesterday, in which he addressed a crowd of supporters from a balcony, the president had no regrets. \u201cThey said totally free of spreading, there\u2019s no spread,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on a balcony. The closest person was probably a couple of hundred feet away, and they were down on the grass.\u201d Bill Gates has some thoughts about coronavirus vaccines, Donald Trump claiming to be \u201ccured\u201d, and politicians such as Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis, who wants to open up sports stadiums for everyone despite a new surge in infection rates nationwide. In a wide-ranging interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, the Microsoft tycoon, whose Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been at the forefront of vaccine development, doubted the president\u2019s assertion that a cocktail of antibody drugs he received was a cure for Covid-19. \u201cThe word cure is inappropriate because it won\u2019t work for everyone, but yes, of all the therapeutics, this is the most promising.\u201d Gates said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with the companies doing antibodies, we reserved factory capacity all the way back in the spring, and now we\u2019re partnered with Eli Lilly who, with Regeneron, has been the fastest to get these antibodies ready. They could reduce the death rate quite a bit.\u201d He also warned Trump, who has objected to federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that would likely delay any vaccine beyond the election, to back off. \u201cYou don\u2019t want politicians saying something should be approved, because it\u2019s wrong to think of political pressure as appropriate in these cases,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the FDA can take the data, which is looking quite good, and get these out in the next few months, because we have so little to save lives. \u201cIt\u2019s likely by early next year that several of these vaccines will get that emergency use authorisation.\u201d But, he warned ominously: \u201cThere are lots of additional deaths coming if we don\u2019t get our act together.\u201d Meet the Press host Chuck Todd questioned Gates if he thought the opening of football stadiums to capacity crowds, as promoted this week by Florida governor DeSantis to the Miami Dolphins, was a good idea. \u201cSociety should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority versus certain more entertainment-related things, and I guess politicians will show what their value system is there,\u201d Gates responded. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll get completely back to normal is by having maybe not the first-generation vaccine, but eventually a vaccine that is super effective, and that a lot of people take, and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis.\u201d Unlike leagues such as the NBA and NHL, the NFL is not operating its season in an isolation bubble. And while there have been no severe outbreaks of Covid-19 \u2013 as we saw in baseball with teams such as the Miami Marlins \u2013 there has been disruption. The New England Patriots, who had to do without their starting quarterback Cam Newton last week after he tested positive for the virus, have postponed their upcoming game against the Denver Broncos after another team member came down with Covid-19. \u201cThe Denver Broncos at New England Patriots game scheduled for Monday, October 12 at 5:00 p.m. ET has been postponed,\u201d read an NFL statement. \u201cDetails on a new game date and time will be announced shortly. Both teams will now have a Week 5 bye. This decision was made to ensure the health and safety of players, coaches and game day personnel and in consultation with medical experts.\u201d The Tennessee Titans, who are due to play the Buffalo Bills on Tuesday, have also shut down their practice facility after a positive test in their camp. \u201cThis morning we learned that a staff member tested positive. We have temporarily closed our facility and are in communication with the league on the next steps,\u201d a Titans spokesperson said in a statement. Richard Luscombe has news from Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s supreme court nomination: Dick Durbin, the Democratic Senate minority whip, does not share the view of some Republicans that the battle to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the US supreme court, amounts to a Holy War. Stepping back from controversial rhetoric over Barrett\u2019s religion, the Illinois senator says the American people see her confirmation hearings, which begin Monday, in far simpler terms. \u201cThis makes a difference in their life. Whether they have health insurance, whether they have preexisting conditions, if they can afford health insurance,\u201d Durbin, who sits on the Senate judiciary committee that will explore Barrett\u2019s nomination, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Democrats fear Barrett will be confirmed to the court in time to rule on one of Trump\u2019s signature promises, the dismantling of Obamacare. \u201cWe believe that once the Republican voters wake up to the reality and strategy, many of them are going to say to their senators, \u2018Listen, this is not what we bargained for, we may be conservatives but we\u2019re not crazy. My family needs health insurance protections,\u201d he said. Durbin, however, refused to be drawn on whether a Democratic administration under Joe Biden would \u201cpack\u201d the supreme court with more liberal-leaning justices to counter the conservative majority that Barrett\u2019s confirmation would achieve. The question has dogged Biden in recent days, and was a talking point at last week\u2019s vice-presidential debate when Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate, also did not answer. \u201cIt is not a negotiating point,\u201d Durbin insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the reality of a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land,\u201d he said. \u201c[Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell has changed the rules for the Republican senators, with running this through at breakneck pace without the investigation that usually comes with this. Those are the issues.\u201d As Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked in talks over a Covid-19 stimulus bill, White House economic adviser Stephen Moore says he believes the US economy does not need an artificial boost. Unemployment claims in the US are just over 800,000 down from the start of the pandemic, but still way above the levels before Covid-19 hit. Donald Trump earlier this week said he was cancelling talks between Republicans and Democrats on a stimulus bill, before reversing course. Republicans want to keep any such stimulus package below $2tn. Democrats want a figure around $2.2tn. \u201cThe economy really is showing signs of picking up. I don\u2019t care what the newspapers say,\u201d Moore told WABC 770 on Sunday. \u201cI see really strong numbers coming in for the third quarter\u2026 30% to 35% growth, which shatters the all-time record for growth in one quarter.\u201d He added: \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not so sure we need a $2tn stimulus bill. I think the fourth quarter will be just as strong as the third quarter.\u201d Richard Luscombe has news of worries in the Republican camp as the election approaches: Ted Cruz raised eyebrows on Friday when he spoke of a possible election \u201cbloodbath\u201d for Republicans. On Sunday he repeated the warning, telling NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that a \u201cdemoralized\u201d electorate could deliver a Democratic clean sweep. \u201cIt turns on optimism. If people are optimistic and hopeful about the future and going back to work, that will be a factor in a very good election for Republicans. [But] if they\u2019re depressed and hopeless, that will help the Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible volatility in politics right now. I believe President Trump can win\u2026 but I also think it\u2019s possible that we see a Democratic sweep where they win everything and it\u2019s a victory of Watergate proportions.\u201d The Texas Republican senator added: \u201cI don\u2019t recall an election in my life with the spread, the delta between those two possible outcomes this close to election day, that wide.\u201d Cruz, who said he has spoken twice with Trump since the president left Walter Reed medical center last Monday, said the outcome depends on turnout. \u201cIn a persuasion election you\u2019re fighting over a small band of voters who are undecided, in turnout elections both sides are trying to turn out their base,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this election it\u2019s turnout. The hard left, they hate the president. The big open question is does everybody else show up? If people turn out it\u2019ll be a good election for Republicans. If people stay home, if they\u2019re demoralized, that\u2019s how we get into a terrible election.\u201d An ABC News/Washington Post national poll released on Sunday shows that Joe Biden maintains a large lead over Donald Trump with just over three weeks until the presidential election. Biden holds a lead of 54% to 42% among likely voters nationwide, which is a similar margin enjoyed by the Democratic challenger in recent months. Among registered voters, the lead is 53% to 41%. It should be noted that the poll is a reflection of the popular vote, rather than the state-by-state vote. The latter will determine the winner of the election and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 but lost in crucial swing states, ensuring victory for Trump. Most state-by-state polls show Biden leading but the margins are smaller than in the national polls. There are some positives in Sunday\u2019s poll for the president. A majority of voters (54%) approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, which is seen as the most important issue among voters (29%). Biden is more trusted on the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans. Biden holds a 17-point lead over his ability to handle the virus. Biden holds a large lead among women (59% to 36%). Biden and Trump are equally favoured by men at 48% each. Trump was favoured by the latter group by 11 percentage points in 2016. Most voters also appear to blame the president for his recent Covid-19 diagnosis. Two-thirds said Trump had not taken the proper precautions against the virus.
