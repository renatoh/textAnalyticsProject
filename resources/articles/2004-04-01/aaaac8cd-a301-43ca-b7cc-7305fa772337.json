Given that his club is well known for never having won a big one, the league or FA Cup, this is not such an outsize claim. Yet, as Bruce conceded, \"you're just rubbing your eyes\" at the prospect of Birmingham appearing in Europe for the first time since their Fairs Cup expedition of 1961-62. At a windswept Loftus Road with its bare, bouncy surface, the continent seemed a million miles away. Fulham have nurtured their own European hopes and Chris Coleman spoke of the Easter programme as a \"big weekend\", with games against Leicester and Blackburn. But Birmingham, given their five-point advantage, have more to fight for in the final straight, not least the matter of second city supremacy over Aston Villa. Bruce knows that reaching Europe - realistically by clinching fifth place - is a bonus. \"It's a bit of a fairy tale. To be in the Premiership just 18-19 months, and to be rubbing shoulders with Newcastle and Liverpool, is a great achievement. But now is the time I call the tickly time, when nervousness inevitably sets in.\" Birmingham's \"big weekend\" starts with what Bruce called \"a really easy one - Manchester United\". That meeting at St Andrews will be a much more severe examination of Birmingham's credentials than was set by Fulham, who seemed becalmed after winning only one of their last eight Premiership games. The acrimonious loss of Louis Saha - \"our best player,\" Coleman conceded - has hit them hard. Fulham also reluctantly converted Maik Taylor's loan to Birmingham into a \u00a31.5m sale two weeks ago. The returning goalkeeper compounded that regret, turning aside Barry Hayles's header and making a remarkable double save from Steed Malbranque and Luis Boa Morte. The return to fitness of Edwin van der Sar, after missing the second half of last season, forced Coleman's hand over Taylor. Bruce eagerly grasped it. \"He's as good as any goalkeeper in the Premiership,\" said Birmingham's manager. \"He has great attributes.\" Bruce also wants to sign Mikael Forssell permanently, but Birmingham's leading scorer remains caught in the uncertainty over Chelsea's future management. The Finn had little opportunity here to extend his hot streak of goals - his league total currently stands at 16 - with Birmingham's only notable attempt being Robbie Savage's drive against the crossbar early on. This fixture has been studded with spite, with four players sent off in their last two meetings at St Andrews, and Savage and Malbranque were fortunate only to be cautioned when they grappled early in the second half. Four other players went into Mike Riley's book, on an otherwise featureless afternoon.
