Just my very presence. I don't have to do a lot to get the juices flowing.\" Neil Lennon made those comments with a smile on his face to the written media the day before Celtic's trip to face Hearts at Tynecastle. Some 50 minutes into the game itself, Lennon had learned what serious dangers can present themselves when football supporters have a problem controlling their emotions. The Celtic manager was not hurt in the attack which provided merely the latest ugly chapter in this, a poisonous Scottish football season, but his shaken state was apparent to all. If it did not exist before, there is now a legitimate question over whether the 39-year-old Northern Irishman will continue in his present role into next season. Lennon has a partner and young son to consider given the intense security which surrounds his every move; a physical attack at his place of work takes things to another level of risk entirely. \"Of course, nobody could blame him,\" said Johan Mjallby, Lennon's assistant on the prospect of the manager walking away from this madness. \"Nobody could blame him even if this [last night's attack at Hearts] didn't happen. It is too early now to say how Neil will react.\" Levels of antagonism surrounding matches between Hearts and Celtic have increased markedly, with events at Tynecastle the only indicator needed that such sentiment has gone too far. \"There was a funny atmosphere, a bit of hostility,\" acknowledged the Hearts manager, Jim Jefferies, of the Tynecastle scene even before Lennon was targeted in such a high-profile manner. Hearts had nothing to play for in the Scottish Premier League game \u2013 third place for them had been secured 24 hours before Celtic's visit \u2013 and as the visitors cantered towards victory there seemed to be little to rile someone sitting in the stands. Yet the visit of Celtic for some reason brings out the worst elements of the Edinburgh club's support, with Lennon a focal point for their animosity. In his playing days, Lennon was vociferously taunted by Hearts fans \u2013 as, equally, have several Rangers players been down the years \u2013 with one punter landing on top of a dug-out in an attempt to \"get to\" the then-Celtic captain. Tynecastle has never been a tranquil place, but Hearts have been shamed by last night's trouble. Lennon has a straightforward theory about why he is subject to loathing at every apparent turn. That is, he is a high-profile Roman Catholic in Scotland; sufficient motivation for abuse to rain down on him at football grounds across the country. The simplicity of that argument renders it useful but others have received no such attention. Lennon, moreover, was not singled out in such a consistent way during a generally successful time as a Celtic player. Despite being assaulted in a Glasgow street in 2008, the irony is that Lennon spoke of missing the city when he briefly departed, for spells at Nottingham Forest and Wycombe Wanderers. Lennon's touchline manner often does not lend itself to peace and tranquillity but no reasonable person can argue that what the Celtic manager has had to deal with this season has not gone beyond reasonable grounds. From bullets in the post to viable explosive devices, Lennon has had to encounter more security episodes than anybody ever involved in the Scottish game. Earlier this week, it was revealed that seven arrests had been made outside Celtic's training centre after a gun alert. The common denominator in such matters is Lennon. Football matters routinely dictate whether a manager remains in post into a new campaign; at Celtic, there is a wider and more dangerous issue at stake. Someone, somewhere, has got to draw a line in the sand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
