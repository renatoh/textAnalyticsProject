It was all, oh so romantic. The HR department took me out for a coffee, and called the next day (the next day, mind you!). Management promised me the sun, the moon and a corner office with a great view. Seven months later I am beginning to wonder where it all went wrong. The colleagues that I thought were so exciting now look just like ... well, just like the lot I left behind at my last job. The training that was going to fast-track my career has been cancelled. Frankly, I want a divorce. But don't talk to me about a seven-year itch; the good folks over at Office Angels reveal that, when it comes to new employers, 78% of workers reckon that seven months is time a-plenty to decide whether you want to settle down or not. Employers should take heed of this: if you forget to tell us how much you love us, slip up on a lunch date or fail to send us flowers regularly, we will be out the door and settling down behind a stylish new desk somewhere else quicker than you can say \"job for life\". \u00b7 The problem is, of course, that bad jobs can be like bad relationships - you leave one and end up in another. Nevertheless, a company called Metsa Tissues says that there is one time when you should always resign: when the company bogs smell. More than eight out of 10 workers reckon that well-kept loos are evidence of a caring employer. However, the nice spokesman at Metsa goes even further than that. \"A pleasant toilet is a positive choice by an employer,\" he insists. \"Of course it must be clean and well-kept, but after those issues it is lack of toilet paper that irritates us most. To reassure the toilet visitor, the paper should be stored in a holder that cannot be opened by the general public.\" I don't think we need to see any more, but let this be a lesson to you all: your job could be a whole lot worse. \u00b7 Talking of scraping the barrel, virtually everyone is convinced that one day they are going to make a million by selling their genius idea for a website. Some go even further and declare that the novel, for example, is dead. \"Who wants to read books and proper sentences when you can just read emails instead?\" they chime. Taking part in this chorus is William Surie, whose hope is that you concur and promptly visit his genius idea, Hollysinbox.com. On this site you can read the emails of his protagonist Holly which are - oh my God it is just so 2007! - updated in real time. Unfortunately, Surie is perhaps just a little too authentic for his own good. For Holly's inbox is full of emails about work colleagues, last Saturday's party, and what to have for lunch ... erm, just like your real inbox. On that basis, then, it is bound to be a huge success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
