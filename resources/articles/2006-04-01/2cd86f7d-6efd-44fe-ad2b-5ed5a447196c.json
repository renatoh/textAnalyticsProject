Noble's first game with Wigan is at Huddersfield tomorrow, when a repeat of the 52-18 victory he enjoyed against the same opposition in his last game in charge of the Bulls on Tuesday is beyond the Warriors' wildest dreams. Wigan have lost their last seven league games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
