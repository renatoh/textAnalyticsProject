Overuse of the TMO has caused major controversy in the opening days of the World Cup and on Friday it came to England\u2019s aid against Fiji after the Bath bound scrum-half Nikola Matawalu burst down the right wing and appeared to score a stunning try, only for replays to show that he had fumbled the ball before putting it down. The referee, Jaco Peyper, was only alerted to the fumble by the partisan Twickenham crowd who had seen the replay on the big screen, prompting the South African official to consult the TMO, Shaun Veldsman. However, if the Fijian kicker had taken the conversion before Peyper intervened the try would have stood, creating the potential for goalkickers to take matters into their own hands. A similar incident occurred 24 hours later at Twickenham when the France wing Noa Nakaitaci dropped the ball with the line beckoning and the try was awarded only for the TMO, again Veldsman, to intervene before the conversion was taken. France went on to beat Italy 32-10. Farrell believes kickers may quickly wise up. \u201cYeah [I would take a quick conversion]. What do you do?,\u201d he said. \u201cMatawalu would have had to run to his kicker and say, \u2018Look, I didn\u2019t get the ball down. Just drop kick this.\u2019 And so, if that happens, yeah [I would do it], but I can\u2019t see that going on much, can you?\u201d He has been on the receiving end of an unfavourable TMO decision himself. During the 2014 Premiership final he had scored a try, subsequently ruled out for a forward pass before the conversion was taken, in the defeat by Northampton. On that occasion the TMO pointed out the forward pass to the referee, Wayne Barnes, something that strictly speaking he was not supposed to do and as a result the rule has now been changed. The issue of too much TMO referral has become worse, however. England\u2019s 35-11 win over Fiji was extended by 10 minutes and eight seconds, in no small part due to the six referrals by Peyper, handing their opponents, who did eventually tire, the opportunity for a much-needed breather. \u201cIt is the start of a massive tournament. They are trying to get as many decisions right as possible and that takes a bit more time,\u201d added Farrell. \u201cAs the tournament goes on there will probably be a bit more feel for how the game is going and it will probably speed up a bit. This is the first round and they will probably have a feel going forward. \u201cWe want to keep the ball in play for as long as we can, we want to play rugby, we want to make the decisions, we want to keep infield as much as we can. I\u2019m sure there are other teams that want to do that. I\u2019m sure Fiji wanted to play some rugby as well. There were a few stoppages that slowed the game down but that might just be the way it is for this opening round.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
