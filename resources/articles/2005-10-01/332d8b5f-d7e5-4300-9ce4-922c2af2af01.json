Its shares gained 20.5p to 996.5p - the best performer in the FTSE 100 - after Numis Securities upgraded to \"buy\" with a \u00a312 target price. The broker believes Whitbread's chief executive, Alan Parker, needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat with half-year figures on October 25 if he is to stave off a private equity takeover. Richard Carter, an analyst, said: \"There are numerous options open to him but we believe a sale, or the significant restructuring, of a division is the bare minimum required.\" He noted that the sale of Marriott and the reduction in its pension fund deficit have left Whitbread vulnerable to a bid. Whitbread was among a dozen or so blue-chip stocks that managed to defy yesterday's downward trend. AstraZeneca was another, gaining 51p to \u00a327.52 on the back of industry data that suggested demand for Seroquel, its best-selling schizophrenia treatment, is holding up despite a recent study that claimed the drug was no better than generic versions. Technical analysts also noted that AZ shares had broken a significant resistance level yesterday. Meanwhile, British Airways climbed 5.5p to 301.5p as the oil price fell, while Compass, the troubled contract-catering group, improved 3.25p to 198.5p in response to an upbeat trading statement from its French rival Sodexho Alliance. In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed 66.6 points lower at 5427.8, its largest daily points fall since July 7, as investors decided to take profits. The spark for selling was events in New York overnight where the Dow Jones Industrial average went into reverse after a Federal Reserve official suggested that interest rates would continue rising because of inflationary pressures. That said, another poor performance from London's biggest company did not help matters. BP fell 21p to 634.5p, wiping about 13 points off the index as Citigroup Smith Barney downgraded to \"hold\" in the wake of Tuesday's disappointing third-quarter figures. Elsewhere, the picture was much the same. The FTSE 250 shed 92.8 points to close at 7886.7, while the FTSE Small Cap index slipped 28.5 points to 3134.8. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 103.890, yielding 4.260%. The online poker firm PartyGaming was the FTSE 100's biggest faller. Its shares lost 7.5p to 86.25p after the Swiss bank UBS downgraded to \"hold\" from \"buy\" and lopped 17% and 26% from its earnings forecasts for 2006 and 2007 respectively. \"Further analysis,\" the broker said, \"suggests that PartyGaming is losing market share despite a $300m-plus marketing programme that dwarfs those of its main competitors.\" Alliance Unichem was also under pressure, falling 18.5p to 831p after Lehman Brothers said the synergies from its proposed merger with Boots, off 9p at 622p, were already reflected in its stock market valuation. Moreover, if the deal falls through, Lehman reckons the shares could fall back to 780p - its target price. O2 firmed 1.5p to 165.5p after JP Morgan argued that the mobile phone company should trade at a level that reflects the very high probability that it will be acquired. The US bank reckons a trade buyer could justify paying 200p a share for O2. Lower down the market, Bodyshop International, 7p cheaper at 202.75p, was one of the FTSE 250's biggest fallers after its house broker, ABN Amro, took the stock off its \"buy\" list. Having risen 30% this year, ABN believes the shares are now fully valued given the slowdown in consumer spending. Elsewhere, Burren Energy closed below 825p - the level at which two founder shareholders sold \u00a3100m worth of stock last week. Other than the weaker oil price, traders said the oil exploration firm had been unsettled by events in Kazakhstan, where a bill was passed on Tuesday that gives the government the right to block sales of oil assets to foreign companies. Although Burren does not have any operations in the country, it does have significant interests in neighbouring Turkmenistan. MFI dipped 4p to 92p as investors gave up hope of a bid for the ailing furniture group. Marconi, 6.5p off at 314.5p, was also under pressure despite rumours that Ericsson has teamed up with a private equity group to table an offer for the telecoms equipment maker. On a brighter note, Virgin Mobile improved 5.5p to 303.25p on the back of Bear Stearns upgrade to \"outperform\". The US broker believes Virgin's sales growth will accelerate this quarter. SSL International, maker of Durex condoms, also closed higher. Traders said a large sell order had been pulled and predicted SSL shares would rise sharply if Boots could sell its healthcare arm for a good price. SSL rose 5p to 265p. Among the small caps, worries that today's half-year numbers and outlook statement might disappoint left Ted Baker 32.5p lower at 448p, while EBT Mobile, China's answer to Carphone Warehouse, jumped 3.75p to 36.5p on rumours that Vodafone, up 0.25p to 150.75p, may buy a stake in the firm. Down the mines Mining stocks received particularly harsh punishment in yesterday's sell-off. The sector provided five of the FTSE 100's 10 biggest fallers as investors decided to take profits. The FTSE Mining index has risen 40% so far this year, boosted by rising commodity prices and the view that mining companies are a good way to play the explosive growth of the Chinese economy. Aside from profit taking, analysts said some fund managers were also selling so they had cash to invest in Kazakhmys, the \u00a32bn copper company that is poised to float in London. Xstrata was the sector's worst performer, sliding 75p to \u00a313.89, followed by Anglo American, off 68p to \u00a315.91, Rio Tinto, down 93p to \u00a322.14, Antofagsta, 60p weaker at \u00a314.72, and BHP Billiton, 34.5p cheaper at 858p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
