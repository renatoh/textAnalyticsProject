Woody Allen's most popular film, Annie Hall, for instance, was saved from disaster by brilliant editing and a change of title (from Anhedonia). When the Marx Brothers left Paramount (where they did their most original work), their new producer Irving Thalberg insisted they test key sequences on stage for their first MGM film, A Night at the Opera The first time a paying audience laughed in the cinema was on 28 December 1895, at the Lumiere Brothers' first public screening of a programme of brief unedited minute-length movies at the Grand Cafe in Paris. One of these, known as L'Arroseur arros\u00e9 (The Sprinkler Sprinkled), featured a playful little boy standing on a gardener's hosepipe, the gardener looking at the rose and then getting sprayed in the face when the lad jumps off. Audiences were convulsed. Comedy became the staple of silent cinema, comedians its greatest stars. As popular entertainment their films alone survived the coming of sound. Chaplin's wily, grinning tramp, Keaton's deadpan eager beaver, Harold Lloyd's bespectacled all-American collegiate go-getter were the greatest, their body language eloquent, their pantomime dramatic. The star careers of Lloyd and Keaton waned with the coming of sound. Chaplin successfully pretended, for a while at least, that talking pictures hadn't arrived. Max Linder (1883-1925), now largely forgotten outside his native France, was the screen's earliest, most innovative comedian. But his health was undermined, first by being gassed in the Great War, then by an unhappy period in Hollywood, and he committed suicide. He was the last comic whose first language was not English to achieve international fame until Jacques Tati invented silent movies on a spectacular scale. Tati created an unforgettable screen persona, and in Mr Hulot's Holiday (1953) he made the greatest summer comedy. Tati is the exception that proves the rule. Albania's love of Norman Wisdom, France's enthusiasm for Jerry Lewis, the worldwide embrace of Mr Bean have not been reciprocated. Continental comic stars such as Fernandel, Bourvil and Toto have not been favourably greeted on English-speaking shores. When Cantinflas, Mexico's national treasure, was cast as Passepartout in Mike Todd's Around the World in 80 Days, he was regarded as a lugubrious ball-and-chain attached to David Niven's ankle. In the Thirties big-city journalists and playwrights poured into Hollywood to replace silent gag writers. Comedians were recruited from vaudeville and music hall. The golden age of American screen comedy followed over the next two decades, the time of the screwball comedy when sophisticated stars appeared with rep companies of character actors in pictures directed by the likes of Ernst Lubitsch, Preston Sturges, Leo McCarey and Billy Wilder. Playing games with the Hollywood censors gave their work a special subtlety. Britain's greatest hour came after the Second World War when Ealing turned from earnest war movies to comedies that ambivalently mocked the Labour government's bureaucracy and subverted the Conservatives' patronising bourgeois values. The result was classics like Hue and Cry, Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore, Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers. They featured music hall artists alongside great stage actors, Jack Warner and Stanley Holloway working with Alastair Sim and Alec Guinness. Freud, who disliked the cinema, had little success attempting to analyse comedy, which is a visceral matter, even when turning on verbal nuance and social irony. Hence the terms 'sidesplitting', 'funny bone', 'rib-tickling', 'belly laugh'. You can argue about the success or otherwise of tragedy and melodrama. But weepies are what make you cry, and when it comes to comedy there's no gainsaying laughter. Interestingly some of the finest comedies concern the very nature of laughter - Sturges's Sullivan's Travels, Minnelli's The Band Wagon, Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy My own favourites? As a child I loved Abbott and Costello. Nowadays only their 'Who's on First?' sketch raises a laugh. I admire Chaplin but love Keaton and I cherish the Marx Brothers' Paramount films. I see Laurel and Hardy's The Music Box and Howard Hawks's Bringing Up Baby again and again - they are immaculate. Hitchcock is a peerless director of comedy thrillers, Singin' in the Rain the funniest musical. Kind Hearts and Coronets is the finest British comedy, though it borrows extensively from Sacha Guitry's 1936 Le Roman d'un tricheur, which vies with Rene Clair's Le Million (1931) as the best French comedy. Woody Allen's masterpiece is probably Manhattan. The only Steve Martin picture I really like is his film noir pastiche Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, a virtuoso piece of film-making that would be remarkable even if it were not hilariously funny. Philip French This is Spinal Tap Dir: Rob Reiner, 1984 by Bill Bailey I've seen Spinal Tap more times than I'd care to mention. The first time was in a squalid flat somewhere in the West Country and it was a real rite of passage. A lot of those mock documentaries leave you craving for something that has been completely set up and polished, but Spinal Tap has the best of both worlds. You've got the improvised chit-chat about getting into hotels and then there's the great songs as a counterpoint. It's very much the balance I try to get in my live shows, that mixture of improvised and polished. I love the melodrama, like when Nigel Tufnell returns to the band after leaving in a huff and they're going: 'Oh, here he comes. Oh, so you're just going to plug us back in, resurrect us then, are you?' And the classic scene where Derek Smalls gets trapped in the pod and all the way through the song you hear hammering and people trying to get him out and he finally appears for the final chord. Then there are the apocryphal stories about the film, such as Ozzy Osbourne thinking it was just an ordinary documentary. There are similarities between watching a funny film in a big cinema and seeing a live comedy show. I've always wanted to write a film and if I did, I'd probably use my show as a template. You're trying to capture the same kind of rhythm and keep the funny stuff going, but you also need a decent narrative thread to keep people interested. I'd also add in a couple of penguins. Hollywood producers always love penguins, don't they? \u00b7 Bill Bailey is a comedian and actor, seen recently in Hot Fuzz Midnight Run Dir: Martin Brest, 1988 by Rob Brydon Midnight Run is not only a comedy film: it's also a caper film, a road movie, a buddy movie. It's lots of things, and that's what I love about it. The comedy is quite sly and underplayed, and it kind of creeps up on you. Charles Grodin, who plays the bail-skipping accountant, is quite an influence on me, with his disgruntled, hard-done-by shtick, which he always plays with a perfectly straight face. The same thing could be said about Peter Sellers in the early Pink Panther films. They became broader as they went on, but in A Shot in the Dark Sellers is absolutely breathtakingly restrained. There's something more of the artist to him in the early ones. He's more disciplined, he's trying harder, he's holding back all the time, whereas in the later films he's letting this God-given talent run off. I find it hard not to analyse comedy films rather than just enjoying them. It's a pain in the arse, really. I watched Wedding Crashers on a plane recently and the minute it came on I was thinking, Wow, what a great set-up. Look at the economy. The only out-and-out comedy film I've done is A Cock and Bull Story, and I'm very proud of it. Any old buffoon could have filled the other film roles I've had, but not this one. It's a very inventive film and I love working with talented people like Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan who really make you pull your socks up. \u00b7 Rob Brydon is a comedian and actor, currently in the BBC3 series Gavin and Stacey Some Like It Hot Dir: Billy Wilder, 1959 by Meera Syal If you're going to do a farce on film and do it with style and panache, Some Like It Hot is the way to do it. Jack Lemmon is just brilliant, as is Marilyn Monroe, who had real, natural comic talent. It's the best example of that era of film comedy and has a kind of grace and speed which a lot of comedy films just don't have today. That film doesn't wait for the audience to keep up, it just goes. You watch a lot of modern comedy and you see where they've left big gaps for the audience to laugh, or they'll pound home the joke. I also adore This is Spinal Tap. It originated the style which has influenced so much of what's going on today - this whole idea of working through improvisation, and actors working with a skeletal script and being spontaneous and capturing the inanities and the tragedies of real people and real life. When you look at Alan Partridge, The Office, Peep Show and Green Wing, you can trace it all back to Christopher Guest's work, and Spinal Tap particularly. I'm afraid my favourite scene is the dwarves dancing around Stonehenge. Nigel draws up this model of Stonehenge he wants for the set in inches instead of feet and so this tiny little Stonehenge comes down from the ceiling. Brilliant. A lot of people say Americans do comedy better, but I disagree. I think it's different. For example, if you look at what Britain's produced in TV over the last five years there are a lot of examples you can point to and say: 'Only Britain can have done that', because there is something dark about it and it doesn't pander to the ratings. \u00b7 Meera Syal is currently starring in Rafta, Rafta ... at the National Theatre in London Sons of the Desert Dir: William A Seiter, 1933 by Martin Freeman There are better constructed, better made films but I can't think of two comedians that I like more than Laurel and Hardy. They're unbeatable. Stan in particular is the blueprint of so many great people who have come since. You can see him in everyone from Jerry Lewis to Norman Wisdom. I'm not saying I'm great, but Stan's so often in my head and is part of my subconscious when I'm working, and I know he is for Ricky Gervais as well. I don't think it's unfair to say they only had about four plots each repeated about 30 times. Sons of the Desert is my favourite. Laurel and Hardy go off to a Masonic lodge meeting, telling their harridan wives that Ollie is ill and they are going off to the mountains. While they are away, the boat their wives think they are on sinks and lots of passengers die. Meanwhile Stan and Ollie are coming back from a boys-only weekend looking at dancing girls and getting pissed, and have to lie their way out of it. One of the best scenes is when they're hiding up in their loft while their wives are downstairs and they're wondering how to get out of it. They're sleeping in the same bed and Stan says: 'We'll be like two peas in a pot.' Ollie says 'Pod' and makes this lovely little action with his index finger accentuating the D. That doesn't sound funny, but if you love them, those little details are so beautiful. People say that doing comedy isn't funny, that it's the hardest thing in the world. No it's not. I was doing The Office for 10 or 12 hours a day, and I've never laughed so much in my life. Pretty much every single take of every single scene would have the camera boys and the sound and everyone laughing. \u00b7 Martin Freeman is filming The Old Curiosity Shop for ITV Mr Hulot's Holiday Dir: Jacques Tati, 1953 by Zoe Wanamaker I first saw the completely silly Mr Hulot's Holiday as a child and I've loved it ever since because I enjoy absurd humour and quirky things. Jacques Tati was a brilliant comic talent and mime artist - a genius, the most extraordinary man. That's good comedy. Bad comedy is when you have to pull your trousers down in order to get a laugh, or when it doesn't come from reality, from truth, but from something fake. If there is a secret to comedy I'd like to know it. It usually comes from something real and spontaneous. If we all knew the secret of these things we'd be terribly clever, but really the arts, and that includes comedy, are all to do with taste. I walked by someone in the National Theatre the other day who was looking at a brochure and she said: 'Oh, it's got Zoe Wanamaker in it. I don't like her.' I thought that was really funny. That's how it is, some people like Damien Hirst, some don't. It's all totally subjective and that's why the arts are so special: nothing can be proved. I am full of admiration for comic actors; it's a very, very difficult thing to do. \u00b7 Zoe Wanamaker stars in My Family on Fridays on BBC1 The Jerk Dir: Carl Reiner, 1979 by Lucy Davis I just loved The Jerk so much as a child. I had an LP of it that I would listen to repeatedly. Steve Martin is so good - it doesn't matter who else is around him. In everything he does, I can't take my eyes off him. I love the very end of the film. The idiot Navin has made his millions inventing something ridiculous and then at the very end he loses it all. There's this big, dramatic, morose sequence when he's got his trousers round his ankles and he's walking round the house and down the street and saying: 'I don't need anything. I don't need possessions. I don't need anything. Oh, except this!' And then he would pick up something random like a telephone and say: 'That's all I need. A telephone, and I don't need anything else. Oh, except this!' And he picks up something else random, and by the time he's walking down the street with his pants round his feet he's carrying a huge pile of the weirdest things. Comedy in film is a weird thing. If something's sold as a comedy, as an audience member you can sit there thinking, OK then, let's see how funny you think you are. When you're watching something that isn't meant to be a comedy and something funny happens, it's easier to laugh because you're not expecting it. I had always thought I liked comedies to come out of very real, natural situations like The Office, but I love the sitcom Nighty Night, which isn't natural, because every moment in there comes from her being truthful. \u00b7 Lucy Davis's next show is Californication with David Duchovny, coming to Five in the autumn Terms of Endearment Dir: James L Brooks, 1983 by Judd Apatow Terms of Endearment touches on a lot of adult themes - family relationships, adultery, cancer - and yet manages to be completely hysterical at the same time. I like to cry like a baby when I see a movie, and if I can laugh really hard too I'm a very happy film-goer. I love comedies that are grounded in reality and that film, like Tootsie and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, had a big impact on me because it shows that you can stay in the real world and get really big laughs and not lose your ability to touch people. I used to write for The Larry Sanders Show and whenever we got stuck on a scene, Garry Shandling always used to ask us: 'Well, what would you really say here? Forget about the joke - what would really happen?' The solution was always in that discussion. Making The 40-Year-Old Virgin was a pretty scary experience for me - it's a big jump from writing a 42-minute story for TV to directing a two-hour feature film. But I always look at a comedy feature as five or seven chunks and each section can stretch out like an accordion, in that the amount of time it takes the audience to meet Steve Carell, for example, and see what his nerdy life is like, can be 30 seconds or 25 minutes. I usually get way too much material and my first cuts, which I always show my friends, are always close to three hours long. I find out what they laugh and care about, and then I start trimming. \u00b7 Writer and director Judd Apatow's next film, Knocked Up, is released on 24 Aug Raising Arizona Dir: Joel Coen, 1987 by Edgar Wright The Big Lebowski has become the big cult favourite for Coen Brothers fans, but I love Raising Arizona (starring Nicolas Cage, right). It's genuinely hilarious and it has had a really big impact on everything I've done. I was 16 when I watched it for the first time, and realised that the way a film is shot and edited can be funny as well as the script and the performances. It was really inspiring because conventional wisdom says you should shoot a comedy pretty straight. I was curious as to why more comedies aren't made like Raising Arizona, and then I realised it's because it's horribly difficult. Doing comedy is hard enough because you've got to give the performers room, but if you couple that with lots of fancy shots, you're really giving yourself extra legwork. Some of the one-liners in Raising Arizona are worthy of the Marx Brothers. One of my favourites comes when John Goodman and William Forsythe are robbing the 7-11 store. Forsythe is stealing balloons and he asks: 'Do they blow up in funny shapes?' And the guy goes: 'Nope, unless round is funny.' One of the reasons we wrote Shaun of the Dead was that we felt a particular strand of comedy wasn't being explored in British movies. On the one hand you have Richard Curtis and on the other you have Mike Leigh, and we wanted to do something quirky and cultish along the lines of what the Coens, Tarantino and Alexander Payne are doing in America. Only we wanted our comedy to be very specifically British. \u00b7 Edgar Wright co-wrote and directed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz Fletch Dir: Michael Ritchie, 1985 by Charlie Skelton Fletch is the story of a journalist who's adopted various different personas to investigate a crime. It's basically just a chance for Chevy Chase to do stupid comedy characters that are quite funny and weird. When it came out back in the days of the VCR, I recorded it and must have watched it a thousand times. I knew it word for word. Mr Poon is my favourite Fletch alter ego: he's this guy with a broken nose, and when he's offered sugar in his coffee, he goes: 'No, never, never.' It's a little bit odd; they're not the usual sketch-show characters. I like Chevy Chase a lot. I feel sad that Bill Murray rather than Chase turned out to be the one with staying power from that generation of comics. Chase was at the height of his powers in Fletch. He was doing an awful lot of cocaine at the time and it's all very hyper. He's that kind of performer where he's ridiculous, and off his head on coke. A good combination, I think. As far as writing comedy goes, I do a lot of team-writing in rooms, which can be a little bit scary at first. The whole process has made me very unembarrassed and unashamed about saying things and showing my work to people. The biggest thing I've learnt is that there's no room for being embarrassed in comedy. It's all embarrassing and out of embarrassment sometimes comes laughter. \u00b7 Charlie Skelton writes for 8 Out of 10 Cats Spaceballs Dir: Mel Brooks, 1987 by Laura Solon It's a spoof of Star Wars and other epic space films. Rick Moranis plays Dark Helmet, in homage to Darth Vader. In my favourite scene he makes the ship go to ludicrous speed but won't put his seatbelt on, so when they make an emergency stop he flies into a machine and it crushes his helmet. It's a great visual gag. I saw it in the cinema when I was about eight and it's the first film I remember really, really laughing at, and the first time I left the cinema thinking, I wish I was in that film. The best comedy in general is when everyone in it looks like they're having a good time, and when you finish watching it you wish you were in the gang. It's not knowing, it's not really clever and high status. It's just everyone pissing about on screen. As I got older I was influenced by Christopher Guest's films. Best In Show is my favourite. Sideways, and was fantastic too. I really like that kind of offbeat humour. You wouldn't necessarily sell that story as a comedy, but it has that real subtlety of detail the Americans do so well. I haven't worked out the secret of comedy yet, but I think it's important to surprise people. In terms of my own work, if there was a test to see what people would find funny it would be amazing, but I don't think you can ever tell. You can only go with your instincts. \u00b7 Perrier award-winning comic Laura Solon will appear at this year's Edinburgh festival When Harry Met Sally Dir: Rob Reiner, 1989 by Dan Mazer Other films, such as Dumb and Dumber and Anchorman, are probably funnier but what's amazing about When Harry Met Sally is how embroiled you get in the story. It's so involving and touching, and you completely believe these characters exist and are going through these situations. My big things in comedy are reality and character. It's easy to go for big broad laughs and things that are ridiculous but have no basis in reality, but When Harry Met Sally is funny in a real way. The more real things are, the funnier and ultimately more satisfying the laugh is. In Borat, the emphasis is also on reality and the humour is similarly character-based. It's not hard to trace a lineage from When Harry Met Sally to something like Borat. It would run through Seinfeld, which is cut from the same New York Jewish humour cloth, and Curb Your Enthusiasm, which takes it a bit further and makes it more real. With Borat, we just went another step further and made it more real still. My favourite scene in When Harry Met Sally is the one where Billy Crystal is in the football stadium telling Bruno Kirby about his bitter and painful divorce. It's an incredibly heartbreaking moment, and you're seeing how completely torn up this guy is that the woman he loved has left him for another man, but their conversation is punctuated all the way through by a Mexican wave. So they'll stand up and go 'waaaay' and then sit down again and carry on talking about how unbearable his life is. It's brilliantly clever. \u00b7 Dan Mazer wrote Ali G in da House and Borat Groundhog Day Dir: Harold Ramis, 1993 by Annie Griffin Groundhog Day is a movie I can watch over and over again, aptly enough. I think comedy is so much about repetition, and here is a film whose whole premise is centred around repetition. Bill Murray's performance is brilliant. I just love watching someone who is very deadpan and has such heavy energy beginning to panic. It's great that his predicament is never explained, and this is a genius film for editing because once they've established what's going on they credit the audience with huge leaps of understanding. There's a great scene where Murray asks Andie MacDowell what she studied in college and she says '17th-century French poetry' and he says: 'What a waste of time.' And then they cut immediately to her saying it again and he starts quoting some obscure French poet at her. I love that. I really enjoyed working with big casts of comic actors on The Book Group and Festival. Comedians are surprisingly technical when they talk about what they do, but capturing a perfect comedy moment on camera can be a nightmare. There's a layer of fairy dust that you're constantly looking for, and directors have this idea that if you do one more take something magical will happen. The funniest situations are the ones where people are desperate, at the end of their rope. John Cleese does it brilliantly. But if someone is thinking they're funny and there's an element of control in their performance, it usually doesn't work. A good actor knows not to apply comedy icing. \u00b7 Annie Griffin is a writer-director whose work includes The Book Group and the movie Festival Bringing Up Baby Dir: Howard Hawks, 1938 by Penny Woolcock If you're directing a scene that you want to be funny, you have to do it just as seriously as you would a really tragic scene; if everybody's gurning and waiting for the moment, it's never going to work. What I love about Bringing Up Baby is how seriously it's played. There's so much unacknowledged sexual innuendo in the film. Cary Grant, who is completely bewildered the whole way through, is constantly looking for his bone. He's engaged to this terribly serious woman with whom he has no sexual chemistry, and in the end it's Katharine Hepburn who helps him find his bone again. We all know what's going on here, but the meaning is never directly referred to and that's what makes it so funny. Some of the film is real slapstick, like the scene in the restaurant where he rips a panel out of Hepburn's dress so you can see her knickers, and she has to leave with him walking right up behind her. But they're not laughing and that's really key. Great comic actors always seem to be slightly embarrassed about themselves and that gives them a delicate touch. I don't like comics like Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy who always seem to be aware of how hilarious they're being. Very off-putting. \u00b7 Director Penny Woolcock's Exodus is due out in the autumn Interviews by Killian Fox and Katie Toms \u00b7 Win \u00a3500 vouchers We want to compile your list of the top 50 funniest films ever made, and to entice you we have five \u00a3100 vouchers to spend at Fopp, the UK's leading independent music retailer.
