It\u2019s been a blast. I leave you with a handy link to the latest qualifying tables. Bye! Kyle Lafferty has also been talking about Northern Ireland\u2019s big win: We knew it was going to be difficult. They\u2019re a team that sits in and lets us have plenty of the ball, but we got an early goal and forced them to come out and play. I think it was a proper Northern Ireland performance. Six, seven years ago this was a game we\u2019d struggle in, but the last four, five years we\u2019ve been winning these games. I think everyone wants to play for Michael O\u2019Neill and that\u2019s important, and it\u2019s good for him that he\u2019s got 16, 17 players that want to sweat blood for him. We\u2019ve worked on set pieces all week. We knew Josh had a long throw-in and I finally got in there and got the goal, and what we\u2019ve worked on all week has paid off. Here\u2019s a match report from Windsor Park: Chris Brunt has had a quick chat about Northern Ireland\u2019s evening: It was a good performance. We knew we were going to have to work pretty hard. For periods in the second half they had a lot of the ball, but we were dangerous when we got the ball forwards, and got what we deserved. It wasn\u2019t a great start for me, getting smashed in the head, but I enjoyed the game tonight. It was a good win, I was delighted to be a part of it and hopefully we\u2019ll kick on. And it\u2019s all over in Belfast, where Northern Ireland have beaten Azerbaijan 4-0 to record a sixth successive home win for the first time in all of history! Also finished: Slovakia 4-0 Lithuania Denmark 3-1 Kazakhstan Some final scores, then: San Marino 0-8 Germany England 3-0 Scotland France 2-1 Sweden Czech Republic 2-1 Norway Christian Eriksen has another goal for the Danes, making the score Denmark 4-1 Kazakhstan in stoppage time. Lewandowski has scored a second in stoppage time, from the penalty spot this time, and it\u2019s now Romania 0-3 Poland I\u2019m with Keith on this one. It\u2019s been a thoroughly dominant display. Bournemouth\u2019s Joshua King has scored to make it Czech Republic 2-1 Norway, but the Norwegians have just three minutes to find an equaliser. It\u2019s San Marino 0-8 Germany, Kevin Volland with the latest. San Marino\u2019s qualifying hopes are hanging by a thread here. Northern Ireland have a 4-0 lead over Azerbaijan! And it\u2019s Chris Brunt who, from just outside the left-hand corner of the penalty area sends the ball low and hard across goal and in at the far post! A goal from open play, of all things! Now it\u2019s Robert Lewandowski himself who\u2019s showing some flair, scoring a lovely second goal for Poland in Romania, where it\u2019s now Romania 0-2 Poland San Marino have scored! In their own net! Kevin Volland crosses low and hard from inside the penalty area, and Mattia Stefanelli can\u2019t get out of the way before the ball hits his shin and flies into the net. San Marino 0-7 Germany Elsewhere, it\u2019s Denmark 3-1 Kazakhstan, Peter Ankersen with the latest for the home side. Serge Gnabry has got himself a hat-trick! It\u2019s a lovely chipped pass, San Marino have given up on marking altogether, and Gnabry\u2019s sidefoot volley nestles inside the far post! San Marino 0-6 Germany Here\u2019s that Lewandowski-neighbouring flare explosion in full: Northern Ireland 3-0 Azerbaijan! That\u2019s game, set and match for the Northern Irish, and semi-inevitably it\u2019s from another set piece. A corner from the right this time, and McLaughlin meets it at the near post, and from following his eyes after he makes contact I don\u2019t think it went where he wanted it to go at all \u2013 I think he was trying to angle it across goal \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t matter much, as it flew absolutely perfectly into the top corner at the near post! And Jonas Hector has put Germany 5-0 up. I\u2019m not sure San Marino are going to come back from this. Goal for France! And their nightmare night is looking sunnier now! It should have been disallowed, mind. It\u2019s a cross from the right towards Griezmann, who was half a yard offside. The keeper comes, runs into Griezmann, fumbles the ball and Payet turns it in! Another good chance for Azerbaijan in Northern Ireland and it falls to Dashderimov, who takes a touch on the edge of the area, opening up space for the shot, but then spoons it over the bar with his unfavoured right peg! Goal! England lead Scotland 3-0, Gary Cahill heading in Rooney\u2019s corner, and Germany are 4-0 up in San Marino, Gnabry scoring from a Kimmich cross. The Romania v Poland game was stopped for a while as fans threw flares onto the pitch. And France equalise within two minutes! It\u2019s another free kick, this time from the left wing, and it\u2019s crossed by Payet and comes I think off Pogba on its way into the net! 1-1! Goal in France! And Sweden have it! They won a free kick, 25 yards out or so, Forsberg takes it and the ball flies straight to the spot that Lloris should really have been occupying if he hadn\u2019t headed off in the other direction for little obvious reason! Great save from McGovern! Azerbaijan\u2019s first proper chance of the game ends in frustration as Yilmaz\u2019s effort is saved. Two more second-half goals: Benjamin Verbic has given Slovenia a 1-0 lead in Malta, and Jaromir Zmrhal has put the Czechs 2-0 up at home to Norway. And England run down the other end and score! Sterling runs down the left and tees up an overlapping Rose, whose cross is headed in by an unmarked Lallana! Scotland miss a fabulous chance moments into the second half, James Forrest shooting wide, and then moments later a Snodgrass shot from an excellent position is blocked by Stones. The players are back out (except in Belfast). More action on its way! An email from Phil Withall. \u201cKyle Lafferty has scored 9 goals for Northern Ireland as a Norwich player,\u201d he notes. \u201cHe\u2019s scored once for Norwich in the same period. I may not be the only one to find this statistic slightly odd.\u201d It is indeed unusual, though at this rate Daniel Sturridge will soon be a specialist international striker as well. And the half-time whistle has now gone in Belfast, thanks to that Chris Brunt injury the last of the games to end. I\u2019ll be back shortly for half two. Germany have another goal disallowed for offside, Mario Gomez the disappointed goalscorer this time, but there was no doubt about that one. It\u2019s now half time in San Marino. \u201cGiroud is running about with all the poise of a Guardsman who\u2019s lost his horse but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s actually touched a ball yet,\u201d reports Charles Antaki, who\u2019s watching the action at the Stade de France, where the score remains goalless. Germany have put the ball in the back of the net again, but this time M\u00fcller\u2019s strike was disallowed for offside, which he seemed pretty unhappy about. Goal for Northern Ireland! Again it comes from a set piece: Chris Brunt\u2019s delivery from the right-wing free kick was superb, and McAuley heads in at the far post! Double goalflash! The 36th minute have broad goals in Denmark, where Christian Eriksen\u2019s penalty has put the home side 2-1 up against Kazakhstan, and in Slovakia, where Martin Skrtel has given the hosts a 3-0 lead. Northern Ireland are absolutely dominating their game. There haven\u2019t been a lot of clear chances, but they\u2019re attacking pretty remorselessly. Germany have been made to wait for goal No3, but the wait is over, as Jonas Hector\u2019s run from deep isn\u2019t tracked, he\u2019s picked out by a short pass and pokes into the corner from 15 yards. Scotland have a great chance to equalise at Wembley, but Hanley gets his free header all wrong, and misses the target very comprehensively. Brunt is being rebandaged, as his first wrap was experiencing some seepage. GOAL! Northern Ireland lead! And Kyle Lafferty is the scorer! Another long throw from the right flank, it\u2019s flocked on, and Lafferty beats three Azeris to the ball and turns it in! And England are beating Scotland, Sturridge doing rather well to turn Walker\u2019s driven cross goalwards with his head. Another decent chance for Northern Ireland, but Magennis blasts his shot straight at the goalkeeper, and he beats it away! Perhaps those video cameras were a wise precaution after all \u2026 Grosicki has given Poland a 1-0 lead in Romania, and Krmencik is responsible for the Czech Republic\u2019s similar advantage over Norway. Oooh! San Marino had a corner, and it\u2019s swung in, flicked on by a defender and could have gone anywhere! Where it went, though, is wide, off someone else\u2019s shoulder. Slovakia are 2-0 up at home to Lithauania, Nemec and Kuka scoring in the 12th and 15th minutes respectively. Elsewhere, it\u2019s Denmark 1-1 Kazakhstan, where Cornelius put Denmark ahead in the 15th minute and Suyumbayev equalised within two minutes. It\u2019s also very wet at Windsor Park. Very soggy indeed. It\u2019ll be interesting to see the pitch if it carries on like this for an hour or so. Brunt is now sitting up, and the stretcher that had been brought on is being taken off empty. His header is also very well wrapped. Medvedev, who challenged Brunt for the header, gets back up after a bit of treatment with his head now wrapped in bandages. Brunt remains down. And then another half-chance for Northern Ireland, as a long throw bounces its way through to Brunt on the six yard line, but though he tries very hard to put some pace on his header, he can\u2019t get enough. And the direction isn\u2019t up to much either, and the ball floats into the keeper\u2019s arms. And Brunt seems quite sore at the end of it. Meanwhile Northern Ireland could also have scored, from a lovely left-footed, right wing cross, which Ferguson, just beyond the far post, sidefooted into the side netting. What a chance for Sweden! They won a free kick on the left wing, swung it into the mixer and it landed on the toe of a yellow-shirted bloke, about three yards from goal, but he gets no power \u2013 and I mean no power, the ball basically stopped \u2013 on his effort. \u2026 and they very nearly had a third another minute later. This could get ugly. Into the ninth minute, and Germany take a two-goal lead. Gnabry didn\u2019t mis-hit this one, running onto a loose ball inside the penalty area and lashing in from 12 yards. Now Germany have scored! It took them almost exactly six minutes, but then the ball was chipped into the area, where Khedira controlled it, ushered it around the keeper and tapped in. Five minutes played, and the best Germany have done is a low, bobbly, mis-hit Gnabry shot, which was easily saved. Meanwhile in France, Paul Pogba has the first shooting chance of the evening, but his left-foot shot from 22 yards flies well wide. It\u2019s raining pretty hard in Serravalle, where Germany are playing San Marino. Could the weather help level this particularly wonky playing field? In the first minute, Chris Brunt tracks back well to head the ball behind with Sheydaev lurking behind him and preparing for what would otherwise have been a pretty straightforward chance. Kick off! They\u2019re under way! Or at least some of them are! There are minutes\u2019 silence being observed not just in Northern Ireland and at Wembley, but also in France, where the first anniversary of the Paris attacks falls on Sunday. Players are out and anthems being sung. Action imminent! Approaching kick-off, and across Europe scenes of pre-match jubilation are spontaneously breaking out (threatening balaclava-clad policeman videoing it all not compulsory). Tonight\u2019s teams I\u2019m going to put some of tonight\u2019s starting line-ups in here. Let me know if I\u2019ve missed out one you\u2019d like.
