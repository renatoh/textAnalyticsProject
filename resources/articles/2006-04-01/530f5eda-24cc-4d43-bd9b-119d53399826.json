Yesterday Arsenal's manager defended Wayne Rooney's right to spend his wages as he chooses, and did not suggest the striker's displays will be harmed by reported \u00a3700,000 losses, but feels that some individuals would find that a distraction. \"I feel it can affect them,\" he said. \"Everybody has to prepare in a proper way for the game and do what is best for him. That's why to make a big career you need to be strong and handle these type of things. If you lose too much money it can affect you.\" Wenger acknowledged managers have a responsibility to \"keep things under control\" but added that players must also behave sensibly. \"You cannot control everything. That is why I say it is down to everybody's responsibility. I remember they said that Michael Jordan, who was the greatest basketball player in the world, has gambled a lot of money. It is down to him but he could handle it. \"Everybody is free to do what he does with the money he has earned legally. In England the bets are legal and you cannot say on one side it is bad to gamble but on the other hand it is legally permitted to gamble. I feel there is a contradiction.\" Arsenal have no club rules on gambling, however. \"They can play cards, but they do not play for big money,\" he added. \"It is like listening to music, it can be a little bit of an attractive distraction. If it becomes a pressure on the player, it becomes negative.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
