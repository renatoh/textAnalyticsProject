I started radiation treatment a couple of days ago, and the 15-minute sessions (in which I lie on my back as a big machine rotates around me) didn\u2019t bother me much. But the idea of having to sit passively as toxic drugs are slowly funneled into my body has kept me up at night. The doctors told me that three days after the first treatment, the side effects will really start to hit me. A nurse told me about possible hearing loss. It\u2019s a scary prospect as I pride myself on my bat-like hearing. She also asked whether I have a separate bathroom that my husband Eric and our two kids won\u2019t use, because 24 hours after my first dose, my urine and sweat would start to become toxic. At that moment, the enormity of my situation came barreling through the walls of the hospital and hit me. I\u2019m trying to keep me and my family safe from a deadly virus, which means staying inside and away from sick people. But I\u2019m also trying to keep myself from dying of cervical cancer, which requires not only going to a hospital almost every day, but pumping toxic drugs into my system that I then bring home with me. The drive to the hospital for the appointment this morning took a fraction of the time it normally does. It was 9.15am and the roads were empty, except for a few drivers who seemed to have forgotten the meaning of a red light. Since Washington\u2019s stay-home mandate came into effect to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the streets of Bellevue have been reduced to dog walkers and a very busy pick-up line for grocery store orders. My husband, Eric, dropped me off at the front of the hospital. I started feeling hot and sweaty, and I was breathing harder than normal. Several security guards were stationed just inside the entrance. I was told to stand in line on a blue piece of tape that kept everyone six feet apart from one another. A pair of nurses wearing long hospital gowns, masks and gloves asked if I\u2019d had diarrhea in the last 72 hours, had been coughing or having trouble breathing. Then they took my temperature. As I walked over to the elevator, I noticed all of the side doors had been blocked off or were guarded by a hospital staff member. I used my sleeve to hit the elevator door, and relaxed a bit when no one else followed me inside such a confined space. On the second floor, nurses led me to a large chair that reclines and even has buttons for a built-in massage and heating. They gave me pillows and a blanket, and there was some cheese and fruit set out. I could see five other people getting treatment, but we were all spaced far apart from one another. I scrolled through Facebook and Twitter, watched some of the governor\u2019s press conference and then put in my headphones to listen to the Hamilton soundtrack. With my 15-year-old son\u2019s asthma and Eric\u2019s artificial heart valve, we agreed no one would come with me into the hospital for these appointments. It was not an easy decision. But to be completely honest, as scared as I have been, the prospect of getting a four-hour break from my family was actually pretty appealing. We\u2019ve been cooped up together in the house for the past two weeks, except for occasional walks, doctors\u2019 appointments and grocery store order pick-ups. My son, Michael, has started having weekly online movie nights with his friends, and both he and my daughter, James, who has autism, have been drawing a lot. They\u2019re really good artists. I\u2019m not sure where they get it. I can\u2019t even write my name the same way twice. The doctors gave me anti-nausea medicine and steroids, so I felt a strange combination of tired and energized when I got home. Last night, I had fallen asleep on my living room couch at 4am, a little earlier than my new normal these days. The barrage of unending questions just wouldn\u2019t stop: Did I wash everything off from the hospital visits? Did I bring something home today? How many days do I have before I start to feel sick? My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax, so I hope that will help. I\u2019ve never been on any type of anxiety medication before. But when we met in his office, with my chair set noticeably farther away from his desk, we both agreed that this was the right choice. My dad died two days ago. It had nothing to do with coronavirus, but it was sudden. He lives in Idaho and we haven\u2019t spoken in five years for a number of reasons, including the fact that I knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to accept my kids after they came out as LGBTQ. But I have been worried about how my three younger siblings are handling this, since they were close with him. One day after his death, Idaho\u2019s governor announced a shelter-in-place order, which means they won\u2019t be able to have a real funeral. I\u2019ve been in touch with my siblings a lot recently, to try and help them as they clean out dad\u2019s house. It\u2019s actually been nice because it makes me feel like I\u2019m doing something. I feel relieved that I no longer have to wonder about what will happen during chemo. I made it through the first appointment, so I know I can make it through the next four more. I\u2019m still terrified about what the next few days and weeks will bring, but hopefully getting over that hurdle will be enough to calm my worried brain, at least for one night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
