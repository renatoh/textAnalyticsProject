One of the serious candidates was TNT, running the Dutch postal system. It might be of interest to know that TNT managed last year to close all their post offices. This year they've given notice to delivery people working 25 hours a week or more. This affects well over 11,000 employees over a two-year period. Herman Huyg Oxford \u2022 So, Tracey Emin has joined the Arts Funding Campaign (Report, 10 September)? Is this the same Tracey Emin who threatened to leave the country if tax for higher earners was increased? Fiona Ogilvie Ulverston, Cumbria \u2022 Your welcome letter (11 September) signed by many outstanding women in British politics, catalogues Ed Miliband's robust support of the cause of women in politics and society. Perhaps he could move further by promoting a Ministry for Peace (to be headed and \"manned\" predominantly by women) to offset our present Ministry for War (MoD). Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 Returning from Uganda with a drum a few years ago, I changed planes at Paris and a helpful Air France cabin staff member tried to fit it into several lockers without success (Letters, 6 September). Eventually she placed the drum on an empty seat next to me, put the seatbelt round it, patted it gently and said \"Sois sage!\" (Be good!) There was no extra charge. Tony Latham Keyworth, Nottinghamshire \u2022 Optimistic nominative determinism (Letters, 13 September)? How about our local doctors' practice \u2013 the Kilmeny Surgery? John Roberts Keighley, West Yorkshire \u2022 Dropped \"da da\" from Bonanza? (Letters, September 10). I think someone is a little tone deaf here. As anyone knows, the theme goes \"dengle deng, dengle deng, dengle deng deng deng\". Glad to be of help.
