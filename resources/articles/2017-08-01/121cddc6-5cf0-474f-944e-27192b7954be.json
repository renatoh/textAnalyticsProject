Top stories Two former US presidents have become the latest Republicans to denounce racial bigotry and speak out against the violence of the far right. George HW Bush and George W Bush issued an unusual joint statement that condemned \u201cracial bigotry, antisemitism and hatred\u201d as Donald Trump faced a growing backlash over his defence of those who took part in the far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The father and son did not mention Trump by name but their rare combined intervention was a clear display of concern about the president\u2019s reluctance to rebuke the extremists. On Wednesday Trump was also forced to disband two White House business councils after several resignations by chief executives threatened to cascade into an embarrassing avalanche. Trump announced his decision on Twitter: \u201cRather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council and Strategy and Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!\u201d The ABC chairman has underlined the importance of the broadcaster\u2019s independence and declared that ABC-bashing will not solve the problems faced by commercial media outlets, as the Turnbull government\u2019s media package hangs in the balance. Justin Milne was in Canberra on Wednesday night as part of the national broadcaster\u2019s annual showcase in Parliament House and took the opportunity to send politicians a clear message as the horse trading intensified behind the scenes. Milne said Australia had benefited from a dual-media system for 85 years, with public broadcasting existing alongside commercial media. \u201cThis media environment has ensured vibrancy and diversity for the good of all Australians,\u201d he said. The City of Yarra council in Melbourne has been stripped of the power to hold citizenship ceremonies by the federal government after councillors voted unanimously to stop referring to 26 January as Australia Day and to stop holding a citizenship ceremony on that day. Alex Hawke, the assistant immigration minister, announced the decision after Malcolm Turnbull declared in parliament that the council\u2019s vote was \u201cutterly out of step with Australian values\u201d. \u201cThey are seeking to take a day which unites Australia and turn it into one which divides it,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cTo change the date of Australia Day would be to turn our back on Australian values.\u201d The Victorian Liberal moderate Russell Broadbent has called for \u201cgenuine refugees\u201d in offshore detention to be settled permanently on the Australian mainland once the US resettlement deal has run its course. Broadbent signalled his intention to break ranks with government policy in a short speech to parliament just before question time, saying it was \u201ctime for this parliament to act to resolve the situation on Manus and Nauru\u201d. The veteran Liberal, who has campaigned within the Liberal party and across party lines on behalf of asylum seekers, referenced a column from Guardian Australia\u2019s David Marr as the prompt for him to call for a permanent resolution. \u201cIf only Christians fought like this for refugees,\u201d Marr wrote last week. \u201cImagine if the Coalition\u2019s big men of faith threatened to tear down their own government unless it brings home the wretches we\u2019ve imprisoned in the Pacific. Surely there couldn\u2019t be a greater service for Christ?\u201d The \u201cmost bizarre dinosaur ever found\u201d may have solved a piece of the complex puzzle of dinosaur evolution. An unusual vegetarian dinosaur with the silhouette of a flesh-ripping velociraptor, whose fossilised remains were unearthed in southern Chile 13 years ago, could upend a longstanding classification of all dinsosaurs. Initially classified in the theropod category, the kangaroo-sized Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was always an awkward fit. \u201cWe realised that it was not a strange, early plant-eating theropod, but rather a strange plant-eating animal that was an offshoot of this other group, ornithischia,\u201d one of the co-researchers said. The new affiliation has major implications and is shaking up the dinosaur world. Read here to find out why. Sport Simon Orchard, the Australian Olympic hockey player, has opened up on his struggles about \u201ctransitioning\u201d from elite sport to the \u201creal world\u201d. Nothing can replace the joy sport brings, he writes, and establishing a new identity in a world without what had previously defined you has taken its toll on his mental health. Cristiano Ronaldo has called his five-match ban for pushing a referee \u201cexaggerated and ridiculous\u201d and says he is being persecuted after failing to have the sanction overturned on appeal. A Spanish football federation committee dismissed an appeal, meaning Ronaldo missed Wednesday night\u2019s Supercopa return leg against Bar\u00e7a and will miss upcoming La Liga games against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Valencia, Levante and Real Sociedad. He has not taken the news well, venting his frustration on social media. Thinking time The Australian DJ Anna Lunoe never imagined she\u2019d be DJing pregnant, assuming no one wanted to see her belly in the hedonistic party environment where people live out their fantasies on the dancefloor. Visibly pregnant performers are still rare in the music world, but at eight months gone, Lunoe found herself climbing the decks in Los Angeles. \u201cWhy should I not be able to perform or do my job because it\u2019s \u2018scary\u2019 for people to see me in that state?\u201d she says. And, she adds, working, dancing and moving helped her combat morning sickness and fatigue. \u201cI\u2019ve been DJing forever, it\u2019s just my muscle memory \u2013 this is just what I do.\u201d Baby and all. A record low in wage growth is hardly news any more, writes our economics expert Greg Jericho. The last time pay packets for private sector workers improved was June 2012. It is an utterly dreadful state of affairs because it means that yet again, despite very low inflation growth, real wages are continuing to fall. And while this is bad news for workers and anyone hoping for an improvement in their standard of living, it is also bad news for the government. Neoliberalism is dead but not everyone has worked it out yet, says Ed Balls, the former UK chancellor. He joins the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan and Katharine Murphy for the Australian politics live podcast to talk about the future of the global economy, what can take the place of neoliberal ideals and how countries can find a balance between the free market economy and the government taking a stronger role in regulating business. What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has been busy on Twitter overnight, from announcing the dissolution of the manufacturing council to the random cheer \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d. He has also responded to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who de-escalated tensions yesterday by issuing a statement saying he would watch \u201cthe foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees\u201d for longer before making any decision on whether to launch missiles against them. \u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\u201d Media roundup After an horrific flu season in Australia, the Mercury reports that Hobart doctors are calling for free flu shots to be available to all. With nearly 1,000 confirmed cases of serious flu in the state this season, GPs say it is putting pressure on hospitals and medical staff, and free community flu shots would significantly lower the rate of those infected. The Australian reveals that the man accused of driving a burning van into the Australian Christian Lobby headquarters was a gay activist who had researched how to make explosives. The Herald Sun has a number of stories delving into the Yarra council\u2019s decision to ditch Australia Day, reporting that the councillors gave themselves a pay rise and are considering a special human rights charter for residents. And the ABC has an intriguing read explaining the technology of touch-screen phones \u2013 and why bananas work just as well as human fingers in operating them. Coming up In parliament, Labor will continue to pursue the government over the citizenship status of Barnaby Joyce. The federal court in Sydney will hear an application from the Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon for the release of the 2016 Coalition agreement between the Nationals and the Liberals. Fitzgibbon put in a freedom of information request but it was denied. Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.
