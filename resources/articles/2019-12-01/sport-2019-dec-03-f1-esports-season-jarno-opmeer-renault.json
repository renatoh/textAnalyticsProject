Inside the Vue cinema on Fulham Broadway a customised arena will host racers from 10 different teams, each associated with an official F1 team, as they complete the final three grands prix of a virtual season. Up for grabs is prize money of $500,000 (\u00a3385,000). But there is also the chance to shape the future of the sport, both online and off. Currently third in the standings is Renault Vitality\u2019s Jarno Opmeer \u2013 lying 43 points behind the leader, Ferrari\u2019s David Tonizza \u2013 and this year\u2019s title might be just out of reach for the 19-year-old Dutchman. A podium finish, however, would still be a welcome improvement for the team who finished bottom of the classification last year. Something significant is also happening on Thursday, when Opmeer will become the first esports athlete to test-drive Renault\u2019s F1 simulator. Housed in their base at Enstone in Oxfordshire, the simulator is a critical tool in helping the team to fine-tune their F1 cars, and for Daniel Ricciardo and Nico H\u00fclkenberg to get used to driving them. Costing by some estimates as much as \u00a320,000 an hour to run, it has not been a facility made available to gamers. Opmeer, it is true, came to esports through traditional racing. A member of the Renault Academy, he was encouraged to try out for virtual competition at Enstone this spring. He took part in the qualifying tests and was selected, alongside Germany\u2019s Cedric Thom\u00e9. Renault Vitality\u2019s third racer, Simon Weigang, was chosen from the pro draft, a pool filled by winners of online heats from around the world. \u201cFormula One is one of the few games where the skillset required to perform is the same as that in the actual sport,\u201d says Nicolas Maurer, the CEO of Team Vitality, currently the biggest esports team in France as well as Renault\u2019s partner in F1 Esports. \u201cOf course there are differences, mainly the physical part; you don\u2019t get the lateral force when you\u2019re driving the video game. But Jarno being accepted to the real F1 simulator shows that you can build from video game to the sport and back, so it\u2019s very interesting in that regard.\u201d No doubt it is also a handy piece of marketing. The truth is that F1 is a minnow in the esports ecosystem. While the game itself has been well reviewed, and the latest version reached No 2 in the UK sales charts, its online audience is small in comparison to heavyweights like League of Legends or Dota 2. \u201cIt\u2019s a successful product but still only for a niche audience,\u201d says Maurer. Pushing the narrative that F1 Esports is as close as it gets to the real thing, and that it is taken seriously by the high-precision world of F1 proper, is one way of setting the game apart from the competition. If the strategy is successful it might help to sell more copies and, Renault hopes, sway decisions when those gamers (preferably Chinese) come to buy their next car.But there are also real, sporting benefits to be had if F1 and F1 Esports can work in tandem, or perhaps even converge. \u201c[It] is still a new industry and a few years back if you wanted to win at esports all you needed to do was sign the best talent,\u201d says Maurer. \u201cThen we started to add coaches, video and data analysis, that was the next step. Nowadays, if you want to win in the biggest competitions of course you need the best talent, you need the best resources around and you need the best training infrastructure. In that last part, where you use physical and mental conditioning we\u2019re using a lot of what Renault can help us with. They are using their coaches and their experts to help us train our esports athletes and that\u2019s very interesting and that\u2019s one of the ways we can achieve the performance we\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s a big, big part of the partnership.\u201d Renault have further plans for working with Opmeer and co, including opening their enormous telemetry suite to analyse data during esports races. In F1, data is taken from hundreds of sensors that record the output of thousands of parts. In F1 Esports there are 190 data points, and 12 customisable elements that allow for one trillion unique combinations. That\u2019s a difference but not a huge one. With each new version of the game, that gap will close. Some inside Renault believe it will be only a few years before the simulation in the game matches that of their expensive invite-only machine. Soon Renault might be able to test real-life changes through mass virtual practice. It might also create a whole new generation of drivers. McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris, fresh from a rookie season in F1, says not only is the compatibility between the two disciplines real but the limitless practice gaming that makes possible can offer benefits. \u201cIn the future I think you can get people who start in esports and come over,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can go straight from esports to Formula One, they would have to still do some steps: F3, F2 and so on. But I think there\u2019s already been some drivers who have proved that having skills on the simulator can translate very well on to the actual racetrack. \u201cThe better the simulators get and everything then the higher the chance of something like that happening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
