However, of the all their recent animations, this is the one that feels closest tonally to the output of sister company Pixar. There\u2019s even a playful dig at Disney\u2019s top grossing picture so far: Idris Elba\u2019s gruff wildebeest police chief berates the city\u2019s first bunny cop, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), for her insipid dreams, urging her to \u201clet it go\u201d. The animation is first rate \u2013 fur is rendered so realistically that it could trigger an allergy at 50 paces \u2013 but it is the writing that elevates the picture. The elegant set-up of the premise \u2013 in a school play \u2013 also serves to foreshadow the climax. The themes of cultural sensitivity and political correctness are handled with real wit: \u201cA bunny can call another bunny cute,\u201d explains Judy patiently, \u201cbut you can\u2019t.\u201d The only weak point is the soundtrack, which features a honking, bland-storming anthem courtesy of Shakira, voicing a pop icon called Gazelle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
