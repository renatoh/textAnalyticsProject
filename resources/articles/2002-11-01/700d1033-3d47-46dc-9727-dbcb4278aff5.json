In that month he won everything he played in and for 20 rounds was 96 under par. His reward for such excellence? Around \u00a310,000, which accounts for the fact that here this week he is attending his ninth European Tour qualifying school and hoping to make it to where the big money is. For, while Archer was picking off pro-ams in Warrington, Wigan and the like, tour golfers were competing for amounts of money which, by comparison, are almost obscene. The winners of the four tour events in August - the Volvo Scandinavian Masters, the Wales Open, the US PGA Championship and the NEC Invitational - were Graeme McDowell, Paul Lawrie, Rich Beem and Craig Parry respectively, hardly stellar names. And they were jointly only 56 under par. But they won between them \u00a31,800,000. Though the comparison is hardly exact, it is the thought of such mouth-watering sums of money that keeps the likes of Archer and hundreds of other hopefuls going. They all know that, when it comes to ball striking alone, there is nothing in it. If only they could manage themselves a little better on the course; if only they could hole a few more putts. Archer, who is 27 under for the five rounds so far played over the Pals and Emporda courses and four shots clear, has achieved both this week. Although the world record for a 90-hole tournament is 36 under par - set by Joe Durant in the 2001 Bob Hope Classic - Archer has played brilliantly this week and yesterday his six-under-par 65 was set up by an outward half of 29. It could hardly have been any more either. His birdie putts measured eight, 10, six, four and six feet, with another of three inches. That speaks volumes for his iron play and for his newly adopted thought process - \"Don't look back; don't look ahead.\" Thirty-five players will get cards by the end of today's round and after yesterday there was that exact number on 11 under or better. It means that hope is not yet extinguished for the two tour veterans, Paul Broadhurst (10 under) and Mark Mouland (nine under). A 67 would suit them both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
