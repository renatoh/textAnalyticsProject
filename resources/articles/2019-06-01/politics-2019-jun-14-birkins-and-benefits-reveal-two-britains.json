But he wasn\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s just that he, and his friends, completely ballsed the whole thing up. Mike Power London \u2022 I was disappointed to see again that the Guardian continues to refer to \u201clocal authority control\u201d in stories about schools (Teachers to strike at school in fight to block academy shift, 13 June).
