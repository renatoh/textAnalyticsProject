A man who left theater for network TV, he sang an opening number extolling Broadway over binge-watching: \u201cTrade the remote for the near, leave your couch and travel here.\u201d If only it were that easy. Maybe he has more luck in the online lotteries? But the Tonys are TV, of course, and this year\u2019s awards, built for the small screen, sometimes felt small, too. For those watching at home, this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 pleasant, politic \u2013 rarely seemed especially live. As predicted, the big awards went to Ana\u00efs Mitchell\u2019s Hadestown and Jez Butterworth\u2019s The Ferryman, with acting nods for Elaine May, Bryan Cranston, Stephanie J Block and Santino Fontana. With few surprises or flukes or foibles, the broadcast rarely made the case for the particular enchantment of live art. Presenter after presenter insisted on theater\u2019s verve and hipness, the endless ads targeting high cholesterol and rheumatoid arthritis suggested otherwise. Although this Broadway season broke several box-office and attendance records, several of Corden\u2019s numbers communicated an anxiety about how much theater matters, like that opening song, in which the stars of this year eventually admitted they watch all the streaming shows, too. And without the occasional job as a Law &amp; Order corpse, they\u2019d never pay the rent. Another number, the best of the night, an uncredited tribute to Be More Chill\u2019s lavatory power ballad, Corden hid in the bathroom, overwhelmed by anxieties about the show\u2019s quality. A third routine posited that theater would be more popular if its stars feuded. Laura Linney and Audra McDonald nearly came to blows. When it came to the awards themselves, the punches landed as expected, though some experimental work, like Hadestown and Oklahoma!, won out over more traditional fare (an encouraging signal). Then again, some didn\u2019t. The Ferryman, a sprawling, meaty work about the Troubles took home best play and a directing award for Sam Mendes, beating out the gorgeous, necessary What the Constitution Means to Me. Like Oscar voters, Tony voters skew older and more conservative when it comes to questions of form. Still, the night\u2019s big winner, with nine awards, including best score for its creator, the folk musician Ana\u00efs Mitchell, and best direction of a musical for Rachel Chavkin, was Hadestown, a swoony, bluesy, sui generis retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth. It beat out more conventional offerings, the jukebox musical Ain\u2019t Too Proud, the movie adaptations Tootsie and Beetlejuice, the tepid heart-warmer, The Prom. Voters also honored Daniel Fish\u2019s experimental staging of Oklahoma!, which laid bare the violence at the core of America\u2019s frontier narrative, In what was maybe, sort of, almost a surprise, The Boys in the Band took home best revival, despite having closed in August. Its author, Mart Crowley, now 83, accepted, honoring the original, who had defied their agents to take the roles. It was an especially good night for Broadway\u2019s senior set, with Elaine May, at 87, winning her first Tony, for her performance as a woman with Alzheimer\u2019s in Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s The Waverly Gallery. Andr\u00e9 De Shields, at 73, wearing a tuxedo jacket that looked like it was made of stardust and dreams, won the first Hadestown Tony of the night. He plays Hermes, the god who guides souls between earth and the underworld and with that same supervisory spirit, he offered three maxims to speed us on our own journeys: \u201cSurround yourself with people whose eyes light up when they see you coming. Slowly is the fastest way to get to where you want to be. The tip of one mountain is the bottom of the next so keep climbing.\u201d (That is not actually true of mountaineering, but when De Shields said it it sounded convincing.) And Bob Mackie at 80, won for his Cher Show costumes. Of course, as the Tonys once again distributed design nods off screen, audiences at home missed Mackie\u2019s acceptance. Only 16 awards were actually presented on screen, an average of about five per hour. In fairness, high cholesterol can be a real problem. This year, producers asked the playwrights to briefly introduce their plays, a feat accomplished with more and less skill \u2013 Butterworth skipped his chance in order to become the Broadway wife guy \u2013 which didn\u2019t play especially well. Only nominated shows provided production numbers, though a late and cringing sequence paired the Moulin Rouge cast with King Kong. Some shows (Tootsie, Kiss Me Kate) chose the wrong songs, others chose the right ones, then staged them unpersuasively and overemphatically. Exceptions include the excerpt from Choir Boy, the swinging lights of Hadestown and Ali Stroker\u2019s brash I Cain\u2019t Say No, from the sexy, trenchant Oklahoma! that took home best revival, which saw her boot-scootin\u2019 in her wheelchair. Stroker, resplendent in a daffodil gown, dedicated her award to \u201cevery kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, has a limitation, who has a challenge, who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena, you are\u201d. Most speeches stayed personal rather than political, with Fontana, a winner for Tootsie, thanking his grandma, and Block, a winner for The Cher Show, acknowledging the \u201cgoddess Cher\u201d. Bryan Cranston, a winner for Network, tried out a joke about a straight white man finally catching a break that he seemed to fine funny. In the evening\u2019s most bracing speech, Chavkin, who won for her direction of Hadestown (two years after she should have one for Great Comet), accepted her award by saying she wished she weren\u2019t the only woman directing a musical on Broadway this season, and criticizing the lack of diversity in theater. \u201cThere\u2019s so many women and artists of color ready to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a failure of imagination by a field whose job it is to imagine how the world could be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
