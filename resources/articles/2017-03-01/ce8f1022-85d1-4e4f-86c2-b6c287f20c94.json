Vardy denied he had been responsible in any way for Ranieri\u2019s sacking but admitted the incident had crystallised the impression of him as someone \u201cfootball fans don\u2019t seem to like\u201d. He said the repercussions had also threatened his family\u2019s safety, featuring a number of alleged road-rage incidents involving his wife, Rebekah, as the victim. \u201cThe story is out there, then people pick it up and jump on it and you\u2019re getting death threats about your family, kids, everything,\u201d Vardy said. \u201cI try to get on with it but when people are trying to cut your missus up while she\u2019s driving along with the kids in the back of the car it\u2019s not the best. It\u2019s happened plenty of times. It is terrifying.\u201d Vardy said the threats had been made \u201con social media, walking down the street, you name it\u201d and insisted he was wrongly named as one of the players who allegedly turned against the manager who won the first league championship in Leicester\u2019s history. He went as far as to say he was not aware of a problem between any players and their former manager. \u201cNo, not at all. Basically if there was an issue you went and did it in the gaffer\u2019s office, man to man. Or you did it on the tactics board because he was happy for you to come in and put your opinion across. \u201cApparently the meeting that got him sacked I read one story that said it was straight after the Sevilla game. Absolute shambles. It said I was personally involved in a meeting when I was actually sat in anti-doping for three hours. The stories were quite hurtful. A lot of false accusations were being thrown out there and there\u2019s nothing us, as players, could do about it.\u201d Vardy, preparing to lead England\u2019s attack in their friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday, admitted it looked strange that Leicester\u2019s players did not express any support for Ranieri on their social media accounts until they started receiving criticism for their collective silence. Ranieri was sacked after arriving back in England from Leicester\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg against Sevilla and Vardy, for example, took 48 hours \u2013 from Thursday to Saturday evening \u2013 before posting his reaction, citing one of the reasons being that he had to bath his children. \u201cI can understand what you are saying but, personally, my tweet was [meant to be] going out straightaway, but I wrote it that many times I couldn\u2019t quite get the wording right. You don\u2019t know what to say. It was 24 hours before I did it but we had just got back from Seville. We were delayed, landed, then went straight home, kids in the bath and straight to bed myself. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. Don\u2019t get me wrong, what he did for Leicester was unbelievable and nobody would have expected that [title] in a million years. We can only thank him for that. The way this season has gone, players never seem to be the ones who get the sack. It always falls on the manager and that is what has happened. We are all sincerely gutted that it did.\u201d A year since the first publicity about his life story being turned into a film, Vardy admitted he had not heard any updates and did not know if it was still going ahead. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d he said. Leicester have won all four of their matches and qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League since Ranieri left, with the former assistant manager, Craig Shakespeare, in charge until the end of the season. The episode, according to Vardy, has been bad for his reputation. \u201cI get abuse at every stadium that I turn up at. You are always going to get stick from fans. It is part and parcel of football. I\u2019m one that carries on and winds them up a bit. Do I enjoy it? Yeah, it\u2019s just me. I couldn\u2019t tell you why I get it, but it\u2019s part of the game. I am not really fussed about it. It\u2019s fine by me.\u201d Vardy also explained why he had not chosen to report the death threats or road-rage incidents to the police. \u201cAll that can happen is they get banned on Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get cut up but if there\u2019s no cameras you\u2019re screwed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
