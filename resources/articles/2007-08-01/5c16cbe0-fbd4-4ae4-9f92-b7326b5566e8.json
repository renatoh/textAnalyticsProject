The two men will come face to face for the first time as rival managers in eight years on Sunday when Manchester City, boasting two wins in two Premier League fixtures, host their neighbours in the first major derby of the season. Their last contact came during the World Cup when Ferguson, enraged by Eriksson's decision to go against United's wishes and involve Rooney, was said to have sworn at the then England manager and slammed the phone down on him. However, it is not Eriksson's way to harbour grievances and he was conciliatory as he looked ahead to renewing acquaintances. \"I haven't spoken to Alex since I took the job but there is no problem,\" he said. \"I don't have any problems with him whatsoever. Alex and myself may have had different opinions in the past about Manchester United and the national team, especially when it came to [England's] friendly games, but we had a lot of dinners together as well. There is nothing personal between us at all.\" History would suggest otherwise given the way Eriksson took on Ferguson during his last few weeks in charge of the national team. The problems arose when Eriksson made it clear he was determined to use Rooney and said he was fit enough to play a key role. Ferguson believed it was unfair on the striker and risked long-term damage, coming only six weeks after he had broken a metatarsal in his right foot. It was a measure of the underlying friction, on Ferguson's side at least, that when he was asked, in pre-season, about Eriksson's appointment he made it clear he had nothing to say about him. Ferguson had none of the good-luck messages that, as a committee member of the League Managers' Association, he usually bestows upon managers in new jobs. He has not spoken publicly about Eriksson for 14 months and was less than complimentary when asked last week what he expected of City this season, saying he found it difficult to imagine them being \"consistently good\". Eriksson's 5\u00bd years as England manager incorporated several other differences of opinion with Ferguson, who believes the Swede was lined up to replace him at Old Trafford when he stated he was going to retire in 2002. Yet Eriksson hopes Ferguson will join him in his office for a post-match glass of wine. \"I think it's very nice if the two managers can meet after whatever has happened in the game,\" he said. \"I know it is an English tradition, so why should I change that? One thing is for sure, I won't be taking Alex's players like I used to.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
