The interview in Horus magazine, which many readers said they believed was fabricated, rapidly drew attention after being posted on Twitter by political analyst Adam Baron. Its opening paragraph, which many readers believed was offensive to the actor, drew scorn for its clumsy phrasing and insensitivity. \u201cDespite being unstable in her relationships most of her life, despite the several unsuccessful marriages and despite the busy life of stardom that dominated her life for several years; the beautiful American Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore has recently decided to temporary [sic] take an unlimited vacation to play her most crucial role as a mother.\u201d After the article first attracted attention, the Huffington Post quoted a spokesperson for Barrymore saying she \u201cdid not participate\u201d in the article and that her team was \u201cworking with the airline PR team\u201d. Barrymore\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. The editor-in-chief of Horus magazine and the head of Ahram advertising agency that publishes it released a letter suggesting the problem lay in the translation of the interview from English to Arabic and back again, but stopped short of admitting Barrymore\u2019s quotes had been invented. \u201cWe apologise for any misunderstanding that might be interpreted as an offence to the great artist,\u201d they wrote. The bylined journalist, Aida Takla, tweeted on 3 October that the magazine may have heavily edited her piece but: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t negate the fact that the interview with Drew Barrimoor [sic] which took place in New York is genuine &amp; far from fake.\u201d Takla said she had interviewed the star \u201cseveral times\u201d. The editor and publisher did not directly answer claims the interview had been fabricated but said all material submitted in a foreign language was translated into Arabic and then into English. As for the opening paragraphs of the article, which attracted so much criticism, the publisher said an article\u2019s introduction could be a \u201cproduct of the editor\u2019s creativity on the condition that it contains no information that is contrary to the truth\u201d. \u201cWe are about to investigate this by checking thoroughly the source material that the translator depended on to write the interview,\u201d they said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
