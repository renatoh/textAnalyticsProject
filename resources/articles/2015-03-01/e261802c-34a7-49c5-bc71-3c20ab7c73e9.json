At 92, the writer and poet can look back on a life of activism, adventure and enterprise. And that life is far from over as she works on what she sees as a neglected history: the story of the anti-Vietnam war movement in her native Western Australia. As she wrote in her most recent book, Tea House Poems, she is often \u201csnuggling down/ down deep/ into bed/ when suddenly/ a poem limps in/ needing attention\u201d. In a soft, clear voice, Holmgren presents her poems from memory. That same voice has been heard at anti-war and anti-logging rallies, in pubs and prisons, on river ferries and demos, and in universities from Austin to Heidelberg, Germany, and on to Calcutta. Twice arrested in forests, she writes of the experience in Peasant in January: \u201cyou look in the eyes of a mild mannered cop as he utters the words/ and leads you away\u2026/ and you point at the soil at your feet/ and you say to him see/ so erodible here/ and he mournfully answers you/ yes, you\u2019re right, it will all finish up/in the creek down below\u2026\u201d. Not only did she decline to pay a $470 fine, she distributed a leaflet, Why I Refuse to Pay My Fine. Her poems are praised for their colloquial idiom and lyricism. She writes of being poor, family struggles, loss and exclusion. In a way she comes from another world, her father emerging out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, her mother born either in Hebron, on board a ship to Australia, or here \u2013 she does not know. Her parents spoke Yiddish when they didn\u2019t want the children to understand them. Her father\u2019s family and family history were lost in the Holocaust. Growing up in York, 97km east of Perth, the ninth of 10 children of the only Jewish family in the oldest inland town in Western Australia, Holmgren knew persecution. She left school at 14 because, she says, of gender and poverty. She captures the times in her poem, Among the Sepias (also the title of a book). At the outdoor cinema, Aborigines were allocated a roped-off area in the far back corner: \u201cWe never gave it a second thought./ That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.\u201d Her life evolved as, in turn, she played dutiful daughter, shop assistant, housewife and mother, unpaid political organiser (often for unpopular causes), charlady, bookshop proprietor, library aide and gypsy. The bookshop sold technical works. Within nine months of selling it to retire, her husband Jack was dead of a then rare cancer. Their three children had moved away so Holmgren bought a campervan, named it Matilda, and wandered the continent for three years, crossing both the Gibson and Simpson Deserts. Out of this came a memoir, A Sense of Direction (so named because she has none). As she left Perth, friends pointed and said: \u201cNow remember, Darwin that way Albany that way.\u201d Her wanderings ended on a bush property in the Bega Valley on the far south coast of New South Wales, near the village of Wyndham, where she lived for 16 years, establishing a huge food garden. Pambula on the coast was next stop. Then, aged 90 and after 15 years had passed, she came to an even smaller village, 420km away, Hepburn Springs in the Central Highlands of Victoria. There she lived for eight months in a small house without mod cons while second-hand material was converted into an unusually designed solar-powered mud brick home, concluding in one poem that the jury was still out on this move. Such wry humour filters through poems such as New Settler\u2019s Prayer in her collection Peasant in January: \u201cMay thy friends from the city sit not in idleness/ as thou carryest into thy dwelling the burden of firewood/ and makest their meal \u2026 May they return always thy tools to the workshop/wherein they dwell\u201d. In The Sun Collection, she is restless and uneasy about her home at the University of New England and wonders \u201cwill someone/ with eyes as practised as mine are/ carefully scan the skyline/ for the first tell-tale puff of smoke/ and scent the early warning/of terror on the wind.\u201d It\u2019s the home where she must kill a snake that tries to take over a shed she built, and capture its beauty in verse. These days Holmgren gets about with a walking frame but does not need spectacles, although the authorities told her to wear them if she drives (distance limit 15km). She wheels across to a bookshelf to find her favourites: Max Williams from Sydney\u2019s Redfern, who was locked up for 30 years from the age of 10; Yehuda Amichai, considered Israel\u2019s greatest modern poet; the Pulitzer-prize winner Lisel Mueller; and the late activist Briton turned American Denise Levertov, whose work is praised as full of passion and lyrical prowess. No fresh verses will come from Venie\u2019s pen, however. \u201cI have not the slightest wish to write more,\u201d she says. Two manuscripts await work with, as she says everything does with her, immense slowness. A treasure, indeed. \u2022 Venie Holmgren\u2019s works Hidden Waterfalls (CD), Peasant in January, Among the Sepias, Day of the Pardalote, And They\u2019re Still Falling are available from Daylesford Book Barn and Paradise Books, Daylesford, or from venie@holmgren.com.au"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
