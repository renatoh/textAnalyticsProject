Holland can feel the icy breath of the Reaper on their necks after their defeat to Denmark, while Germany got the better of Portugal in a game that failed to live up to expectations. Jacob Steinberg and Scott Murray join AC Jimbo in the studio and Rafa Honigstein's on the blower to look back on both of those games, while James Horncastle helps us look forward to Sunday's action, not least Italy's encounter with reigning champions Spain. Paolo Bandini and Amy Lawrence are with us tomorrow - make sure you are too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
