Last spring when he was at Norwich he spoke of his disappointment that the number of black and ethnic minority coaches had dwindled \u2013 from five across the Premier League, Football League and Conference Premier at the beginning of the 2013-14 season to only him. He lost his job shortly afterwards. Now back in the game at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, he is keen to promote the sense of possibility. \u201cI\u2019m always conscious of that and it\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud to do. When you speak to potential black and ethnic coaches who want to go into the game, one aspect that they always speak about are role models. They would like to see representation, more at a higher level. And any part I can play in that I am delighted to do.\u201d Hughton suggests there is a growing will to see a positive change. \u201cAt this moment I see a real enthusiasm from the stakeholders \u2013 the PFA, certainly, the FA and the LMA \u2013 to address some of the imbalances. And certainly in the area of education I think we\u2019re seeing an upturn in the number of black and ethnic coaches wanting to participate in courses and that\u2019s certainly a way to go.\u201d While he calls for transparency in the interview process, he is not convinced the Rooney Rule that requires teams in America to interview minority candidates is the way to go. \u201cIf we can change that without legislation, that\u2019s the best way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
