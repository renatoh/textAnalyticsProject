Animal's People by Indra Sinha, shortlisted for last year's Booker, took the best book award for the Europe and Asia region, while the regional Best First Book prize went to A Golden Age by Tahmima Anam, which made the final five in the 2007 Guardian's First Book Award. Both books go forward to contest the overall prize with regional winners from throughout the Commonwealth. Judges praised Indian author Sinha's harrowing but warmly human novel, which follows a young man injured in the Bhopal disaster, for \"its fiercely original, zesty style, coupled with seriousness of theme and intent\". Anam's fictional account of the war of independence in her native Bangladesh, interwoven with her own family's history, was hailed as \"evocative and sensitive\". Sinha described the award as \"a great honour\". \"I am delighted for Animal and his friends,\" he said. Anam also declared herself thrilled at the news. \"Over the years, many of my most cherished authors have been winners of the Commonwealth Prize,\" she said, \"and I'm deeply honoured to have been given the chance to be counted among them. I'm particularly proud to be representing my country as the first regional winner from Bangladesh.\" Parallel ceremonies in the other Commonwealth regions also declared their regional winners tonight. In the Africa region, Karen King-Aribisala's novel about a young woman's investigation of her \"ancestral enslavement\", The Hangman's Game, took Best Book. Best First Book went to Imagine This by Sade Adeniran, which follows two young children growing up in London and Nigeria. In the Canada and Caribbean region, Best Book went to Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes, the true story of one woman's journey from her village in west Africa, through slavery in South Carolina to a hard-won liberation. CS Richardson won Best First Book with The End of the Alphabet, the story of a man who develops a rage for travel after hearing he has only weeks to live. Steve Carroll's The Time We Have Taken - portraying an eccentric community in a Melbourne suburb - won Best Book in the in the South East Asia and South Pacific region. The Anatomy of Wings by Karen Foxlee, a precocious 10-year-old's search for the reasons behind her sister's suicide, was awarded Best First Book. The regional winners in both categories now contend for the overall prizes, to be awarded on May 18 at the Franschhoek literary festival in South Africa.
