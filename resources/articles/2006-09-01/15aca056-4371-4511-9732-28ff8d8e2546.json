Fernando Torres has extended his Atletico Madrid contract until 2009. \"It is an important day for the club and it's fans because Torres is more than just another player,\" a spokesman said. \"He was developed through our youth system and for some time has been the reference for the club on and off the pitch. He is an example for all the youth players who dream of playing in the Vicente Calderon one day.\" Torres, 22, joined Atletico at 11, scored his first goal for the senior team in May 2001 and has been their leading scorer in each of the past four seasons. England have equalled their all-time high of fourth place in the Fifa rankings and moved above Italy, whose form since winning the World Cup two months ago sees them slip to fifth.

The Republic of Ireland are down five and share 43rd with Iran. David Johnson of Nottingham Forest has retired due to a back injury.
