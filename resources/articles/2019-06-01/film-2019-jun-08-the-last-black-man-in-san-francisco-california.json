Fails, playing a fictionalized version of himself, and right-hand man Montgomery (Jonathan Majors) mount a quixotic effort to reclaim his African-American family\u2019s gorgeous Victorian home that has long since been purchased by white owners and insufficiently loved ever since. But even in the year since Talbot and Fails, Mission-Bernal district residents both, wrapped shooting, their vision of a partially vanished San Francisco has already been overwritten. \u201cIt became a common theme, us getting into places right before they were gutted and bulldozed,\u201d Talbot tells the Guardian at the offices of boutique distributor A24, clad in a well-worn black-and-orange Giants cap. \u201cThe Candy House in Double Rock, they tore those housing projects down after we finished shooting. Montgomery\u2019s house, which is at the furthest corner of Hunters Point, has those two empty lots on either side in the movie. Now one of them is filled with, what\u2019d you call it, a glorified cardboard box?\u201d \u201cShelving,\u201d Fails grumbles. \u201cThe building looks like shelving.\u201d With straits as dire as they\u2019ve ever been, these two pals conceived their film as an affectionate salvage ethnography for a special corner of America threatened by gentrification. \u201cIt\u2019s as much our valentine to San Francisco as it is an attempt to archive everything we love, so our kids can see it someday,\u201d Talbot explains. Without getting into the nitty-gritty of policy, the script \u2014 based on Fails\u2019 actual experiences with his former house \u2014 provides a guide to pushing back against the forces of so-called \u2018urban development.\u2019 Talbot and Fails genuinely believe that through cooperative togetherness, the Bay Area region\u2019s rich heritage can be preserved and continued. \u201cIf you talk to your neighbors and participate in the local culture, that has a different effect on the community than if you don\u2019t,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cPeople think of themselves as gentrifiers and don\u2019t get involved because they\u2019re scared of confrontation, they have some sort of guilt that goes along with that. But many of the great San Franciscans, who fought for the city and made it what it was, were not from San Francisco.\u201d Looking at the land they call home, they both wanted to build something inclusive and tender and just. So, after shrinking the scale of their ambition from the size of a metropolitan area to that of a movie set, they did. From the earliest planning sessions over aimless constitutionals through the streets they\u2019d make their set to the last day of post-production, Talbot and Fails emphasized a DIY-style ethic of ground-up support. After all, that\u2019s how they got their start; their rambling conversations eventually \u201ccongealed\u201d (Talbot\u2019s word, enunciated with a theatrical relish) into an outline of something that could be a story. Over the next couple of years of grassroots development, the proof-of-concept trailer they put together as a calling card drew the attention of creative types sharing in his crusade. Talbot takes issue with this characterization of his narrative, though: \u201cPeople were inspired by Jimmie.\u201d A short film titled American Paradise got them into Sundance\u2019s good graces in 2017, and a Kickstarter fundraiser brought them the money required to complete their first feature-length effort. Two years later, Sundance welcomed them back as returning heroes, sending Talbot off with US dramatic directing award. San Francisco raised them and took care of them when their careers were still in the fledgling stages, and they used their resources to return the favor. Talbot and Fails attracted the best and brightest of San Francisco\u2019s thriving arts scene and put them to work on both sides of the camera. They packed the cast with actors with an innate feel for what makes the neighborhood unlike any other, scoring their first big name with born-and-raised Bay Area guy Danny Glover. Other behind-the-scenes personnel contributed perspective and expertise; ride-or-die producer Khaliah Neal knew the terrain like the back of her hand, while Berkeley-bred consultant Emma Nicholls brought a facility for performance art that shaped Jimmie and Montgomery\u2019s act of artistic rebellion in the film\u2019s final stretch. \u201cIt was important to us that a lot of the cast be from San Francisco,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cPeople like the Greek chorus, they\u2019ve been in the city forever. It\u2019s about authenticity, sure, but it\u2019s also about showing how fuckin\u2019 talented the city is. People have been doing incredible work for decades, and we wanted to show off some of the ones we grew up with.\u201d That spirit of pride comes through in every aspect of Talbot and Fails\u2019 style, their method packed with touches of specificity to convey maximum adoration. Jimmie and Montgomery get around by doubling up on a single skateboard, a nod to the city\u2019s history as a cradle for black skating culture in America. \u201cBack in the \u201990s,\u201d Fails recalls, \u201cSan Francisco was a mecca for skateboarders. The hills attract a lot of people \u2014 black, Asian, Latino. That\u2019s where the melting-pot thing feels strongest.\u201d At every possible opportunity, they made the choice that would enhance their film\u2019s street cred, and that included the soundtrack. A more somber cover of \u201860s pop standard \u201cSan Francisco\u201d from R&amp;B crooner Michael Marshall scores one pivotal scene and gave the trailer a stirring musical component, but it represented something more significant to Talbot and Fails. \u201cIt was great to have it adapted by Mike, his soulful voice was perfect,\u201d Fails says. \u201cHe made it sound like gospel. I\u2019d never really heard the song until I heard his version. It never hit me that way, and that\u2019s been a common reaction.\u201d Talbot adds: \u201cIt was really written for Monterey Pop, for locals nervous about the kids that would descend on Monterey, both reassuring them that the kids would come peacefully \u2013 \u2018wear flowers in your hair\u2019 \u2013 and urging the kids to do just that. Kind of bizarre. Over time, a new warming nostalgia has formed around what\u2019s really a pretty song. But today\u2019s San Francisco isn\u2019t the same city it was in the \u201960s, and we wanted the song to reflect that.\u201d Perhaps most crucially, Talbot and Fails extended their guiding principles of empathy and respectful engagement past their relationship to the city, and applied them to their relationship to one another. They both recognized the fraught optics of a white man assuming the position of steward to a black man\u2019s life story, but felt that the racial dimension had little bearing on their process. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say you don\u2019t see color,\u201d Fails says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like, this is my best friend. We\u2019re not just collaborators, like, he\u2019s telling my story and I\u2019m OK with that. This is my best friend.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a worthy discussion,\u201d Talbot clarifies. \u201cThere really are a lot of stories in San Francisco that I\u2019m not the right person to tell. But because Jimmie and I have worked together for so long and been close for even longer, it just felt natural to do it this way.\u201d They don\u2019t labor under any delusions that the movie they\u2019ve made can be a substitute for activism, but hope that it might be a catalyst for the same. They agree that only through purposeful unity can collective action be made possible, and strive to foster that ideal through their film\u2019s big, open heart. Their fondness for the city only gets stronger as tech moguls continue to carve it up. Talbot and Fails posit love as resistance, cinema as call to action, and themselves as servants to a higher cause. \u201cWe feel critical of the city, and take issue with what\u2019s happening there,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that the battle\u2019s lost. I think there\u2019s still hope for San Francisco.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about coming together, the real San Franciscans who are still there,\u201d says Fails. \u201cCreating one voice to represent everyone. You can fight back with art, that worked for them in the \u201960s. But only because they banded together and had that community feeling. That\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d The Last Black Man in San Francisco is now out in the US and will be released in the UK later this year"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
