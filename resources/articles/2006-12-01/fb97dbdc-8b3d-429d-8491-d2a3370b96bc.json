The good news, reports McFadden, is that the research endorses the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), a programme that inspired Labour's social exclusion plan published in September. NFP offers support from trained nurses to young first-time mothers and their babies. Support starts from before birth until the children are two years old. Participation is voluntarily, with a 70% take-up rate from the expectant mothers referred. Labour's proposals provoked hostility from left and right, but the Denver evidence, believes McFadden, suggests the government is on the right track. \"I don't see anything progressive about knowing that the poorest, most disadvantaged children are often the most likely to struggle at school and lose out in later life, yet doing nothing to try to prevent those consequences happening in the first place.\" Though the UK has an established health visitor system, McFadden argues that this benefits the better-off disproportionately. The NFP is more closely targeted and intensive: each nurse has a caseload of about 25 mothers, compared with around 400 for UK health visitors. McFadden believes the Colorado assessment shows that the programme results in better maternal health, reduced pregnancy complications, and fewer cases of neglect and injury to children. He says this might explain why it enjoys bipartisan support in Colorado. \"In a country traditionally sceptical about government intervention, Democrats who support better childcare and Republicans who want to head off crime have united in supporting the use of taxpayers' dollars for a programme that seems to tick both boxes.\" Labour plans to use NFP as a model for 10 UK trials in the next two years. This will be a test for the Tories, believes McFadden. \"It is one thing to claim you support families but another to do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
