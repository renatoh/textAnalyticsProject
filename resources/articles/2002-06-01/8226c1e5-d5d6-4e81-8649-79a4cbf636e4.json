True, England have yet to beat Brazil in a World Cup and this will be the fourth time of asking. Yet, if it is ever going to happen, there surely will never be a better opportunity than today's quarter-final here in Shizuoka. The present Brazilian team is a mixture of the marvellous and the mundane, beguiling but beatable. If England can keep their shape, their tactical discipline and above all their heads, there is no reason why Sven-Goran Eriksson's team should not continue to confound the odds by reaching the last four. The prize is a semi-final against the winners of tomorrow's quarter-final in Osaka between Senegal and Turkey. England, therefore, are tantalisingly in sight of an even better chance to play in their first World Cup final since 1966 than they were under Bobby Robson in 1990, when West Germany stood in their way at the penultimate stage and denied them in a penalty shootout. England have much going for them. Memories of their first-round victory over Argentina, on paper a markedly better team than Brazil, are still fresh. The wet season in Japan, now under way in soggy earnest, will make the players feel at home. And Michael Owen came through practice yesterday evening without a twinge from his troublesome groin. \"Michael will start,\" a relieved Eriksson declared when training had ended. \"He has had a very good session. Of course this is good news for him. I think Michael is waiting, waiting for these big, big games because he always saw that in his life.\" Presumably the rest of the England squad are beginning to feel the same way. Seldom has so underrated an England side confounded to this extent the initial lack of expectation about its prospects in a major tournament. \"I am very proud of them,\" said Eriksson. \"They have always done a marvellous job for me - in the qualifying games, not just here. You can't expect them to play excellent football in every game for 90 minutes but we have almost done that. I'm sure they'll do a good job tomorrow.\" Anything less than a reprise of the defensive excellence that frustrated Argentina and the attacking elan that swept aside Denmark and England will probably go out today. In Kobe on Monday they saw Belgium reach the point of taking over command of their second-round match against Brazil only to fall behind to a superb goal from Rivaldo when they momentarily took their eye off the ball. Eriksson is well aware of the dangers. \"We have to be as patient as always,\" he said, \"especially when defending. We must try not to go to the ground when tackling. When you have a man on the ground you play with one man less. So we must stay on our feet. \"We have to be very compact and work hard as a unit,\" he continued. \"If we don't do that, if we give Brazil time and space, they will kill us. \"When you watch Brazil playing you have the feeling that every time they take the ball over the halfway line they will score a goal. But, if we play as we played against Argentina and the other teams, why shouldn't we win?\" Ronaldo and Rivaldo, who between them have scored nine times in the tournament, would appear to pose the biggest threat to an England defence which has not conceded a goal since early in the second half of their opening game against Sweden. Yet a greater danger could be Ronaldinho, with his ability to slice through defences from either flank, or Denilson if he comes off the bench. Either way the England full-backs Danny Mills and Ashley Cole are in for a busy afternoon. England will want to avoid a slow start while giving nothing away for the first 20 minutes or so. If by then Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes have upstaged Gilberto Silva in midfield Eriksson's side will have a platform from which to launch Owen and Emile Heskey at Brazil's shaky central defenders. In theory this looks simple. In practice it is going to require another outstanding performance from Butt and demand even more of Scholes and Trevor Sinclair; even that may not be enough unless David Beckham can raise his overall level of performance to what it was before his foot injury. At least the Mexican referee, Felipe Ramos Rizo, has a reputation for even-handedness. Rizo, however, has already sent off three players in this World Cup, including France's Thierry Henry, so the tackling will need to be beyond reproach; this match will be the most stringent test yet for Mills. So who will win? Possibly England if they score first, almost certainly Brazil if they take the lead. To an extent it will depend on how well Owen can upstage the three Rs of Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, but equally on Eriksson's defence minding its Ps and Qs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
