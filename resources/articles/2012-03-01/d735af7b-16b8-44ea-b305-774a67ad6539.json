With its thundering rock-bass grooves and scorching early Ornette Coleman/Don Cherry horn sound, \"afraid\" doesn't seem to be in their vocabulary, but this spirited set suggests Judge means they have more eclectic tastes than they've previously let on. With appearances from Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley (bassist Jim Barr and drummer Clive Deamer share Portishead duties with Get the Blessing) and singer Robert Wyatt, OC DC spans sinister, Morricone-like atmospherics, the Miles Davis of Sketches of Spain, a Joe Meek 1960s rock sound, Ornette-sax soulfulness, and a kind of jazz-rock systems music. The title track is familiar Blessing territory (chunky bass-guitar vamps, dirgey horn counterpoint, patient harmony shifts). The haunting trumpet melody and Wyatt's doleful wordless chant on Americano Meccano opens up the Morricone world, Adagio in Wot Minor has delicious sax/trumpet harmonies driven by taut drums, and if the looping, handclappy Pentopia went on twice as long that would still be just fine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
