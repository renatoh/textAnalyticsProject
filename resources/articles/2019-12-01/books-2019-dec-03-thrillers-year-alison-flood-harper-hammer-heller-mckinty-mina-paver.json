The central image at the heart of the novel, of a man who has perished in the punishing heat of Australia\u2019s outback, hours from anywhere, has stayed with me ever since. Just as good \u2013 perhaps even better \u2013 than Harper\u2019s excellent thrillers The Dry and Force of Nature, this follows a small cast in a vast, terrifyingly empty setting, as the dead man\u2019s eldest brother tries to determine whether his sibling deliberately walked out to his death or if a malign third party was involved. Aussie noir \u2013 or as it has also been dubbed, \u201cbush noir\u201d \u2013 is my new favourite genre, and if you like Harper, try Chris Hammer\u2019s Scrublands (Wildfire), in which a community permanently threatened by bush fires tries to understand why its young priest turned a gun on his congregation. Continuing the theme of thrillers that pit protagonists against the implacable dangers of the natural world, but shifting the action to the Maskwa River in northern Canada, is Peter Heller\u2019s The River (W&amp;N). The novel follows two students who take the summer off to canoe the remote waterway, only to find themselves trying to outrun a forest fire \u2013 \u201cthey didn\u2019t say a word but the silence of it and the way it seemed to breathe scared them to the bone\u201d \u2013 as a man they think is a killer follows in their tracks. The prose is glorious, Heller\u2019s evocation of the natural surroundings stunning, but, most important, the tension is razor-sharp. Adrian McKinty\u2019s The Chain (Orion) is an ingenious realisation of a horrible premise. When Rachel\u2019s teenage daughter Kylie is kidnapped, the only way to get her back is to kidnap another child, with her victim\u2019s parents then forced to abduct their own hostage. \u201cThat\u2019s how The Chain works and goes on for ever.\u201d McKinty explores what parents will do when a child is in danger, forcing the reader to ask at every turn just how far they\u2019d go themselves. It\u2019s impossible to put down until you reach the denouement, nails bitten to the quick and eyes wide in horror. Denise Mina is always brilliant, but Conviction (Harvill Secker) is, I think, her best yet \u2013 joyously dark, comic, loads of fun. The main character, Anna, is devastated when her husband announces one morning that he is leaving her for her best friend, and taking the kids too. Anna\u2019s reaction? She gets stuck into a true crime podcast \u2013 wouldn\u2019t we all? \u2013 and becomes obsessed with the fact that she used to know one of the victims. So begins a wild and wonderful journey to the truth at the heart of the podcast, and at the heart of the lies on which Anna has built her family life. Months after reading it, I remain obsessed with Michelle Paver\u2019s Wakenhyrst (Head of Zeus), set in Suffolk in the early 1900s and featuring a historian, Edmund Stearne, who slaughtered \u201cthe first person he came across in the most bizarre and horrible way\u201d. There are many layers to this thriller: did Stearne really awaken an ancient evil when he found a painted devil in the local churchyard? What is the medieval mystic Margery Kempe\u2019s role in the affair? And what will Stearne\u2019s daughter, Maud, a lonely child growing up between superstition and religion amid the glorious fens, that \u201clast stretch of the ancient marshes that once drowned the whole of East Anglia\u201d, discover about her father? Spooky, twisted and unforgettable. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com.
