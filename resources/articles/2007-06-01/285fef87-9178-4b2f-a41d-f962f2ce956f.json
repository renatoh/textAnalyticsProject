As a piece of pomposity, it ranked alongside your average coronation. But was it actually a joke? A perfectly stitched, hand-crafted example of the higher irony? I still do not know. This is what happened. At prime minister's questions, David Cameron was tweaking the prime minister over his speech about the press this week. He pointed out that the government had briefed the tabloids that a \"Sarah's law\" would soon be enacted. (This would be designed to make life easier for vigilantes with petrol bombs to find cowering nonces.) It had been dropped. What's more, the home secretary's words about \"chemical castration\" turned out to mean that a few paedophiles would be given Prozac. And while he was at it, what on earth had happened to the Bichard report on the need for police cooperation? \"Is the prime minister at all surprised that the press are cynical about his government?\" Mr Blair declined to answer these questions. He is a genius at not answering questions. He is the Lewis Hamilton of the Formula One not-answering circuit. With his sublime self-belief and flame-proof suit, no one can get near him. Then up rose, in his majesty, the superb figure of Sir Gerald Kaufman, who I think of as the Sir Peter Tapsell of the Labour benches, in that they are both elder statesman and both possessed of an iron certitude about the importance of their every word. When they speak the editor of Hansard himself - an equally majestic figure with mutton-chop whiskers and pince-nez - arrives with his goose quill to take personal charge. \"Why,\" he demanded, \"did the prime minister pull his punches when speaking about the press yesterday? \"Is he not aware that, over these years, a huge proportion of the press coverage of politics has consisted of fiction, propaganda and gossip?\" At this, delighted Tories pointed scornful fingers at the Labour front bench - in their view the greatest of all sources for fiction, propaganda and gossip. But then Sir Gerald brought them close to ecstasy. \"A serious deterioration has occurred since I worked as a political journalist in the house!\" The Tories collapsed with chortling, rocking, knee-hugging glee. Sir Gerald, one of the best-known scriptwriters for That Was The Week That Was, the TV show that did more than any programme before or since to destroy deference towards political leaders! And the man who worked in No 10, alongside Harold Wilson, a man on whose shoulders fiction and propaganda were permanantly perched, like a witch's familiars! So it must have been a joke, delivered with the straight face sometimes only a comedy genius can manage. Harold Lloyd, Paul Merton, and now Sir Gerald Kaufman! Or was it? Could he, conceivably, have meant it seriously? I really do not know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
