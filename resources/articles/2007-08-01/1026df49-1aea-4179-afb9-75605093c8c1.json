In 2002, he did three things: he moved to Huddersfield, he came out, and he joined the Yorkshire Terriers. \"It was good to see that they were all normal people like me.\" In the team, Robert met other young gay men in their 20s and 30s, but also older men in their 40s. Some were fathers who brought their sons to training. Some had come out, some hadn't. Some were butch, some camp. \"It's often the guys who are very effete off the pitch that go for the nastiest tackles on it,\" says team captain Pete Farrow, 30. \"We once had a female impersonator playing on the left wing, and he was pretty useful.\" Gay footballers are notoriously absent from professional football. But the problem is not simply that footballers are uncomfortable with homosexuality, explains Farrow. The gay scene also has hang-ups about football. The Terriers, he says, offer not just an escape from the macho culture on the terraces, but also the sometimes oversexualised atmosphere within the gay scene. Stephen Fenton, 34, explains: \"I have always been a Middlesbrough fan, but a lot of my gay friends give me funny looks when I start talking about football. When I talk about my team, they'll go, 'Ooh, the showers must be fun!' Actually, it's simple: you wash your hair, dry yourself and get changed. That's it. The Gay League we play in publishes a regular 'lust list', but I don't admire the physique of any particular Premiership player. I prefer to talk about game stats.\" The HMS Albion team Even though the HMS Albion is a relatively steady ship - it has the largest aircraft landing platform in the UK navy - seasickness is always a feature of life on the ocean waves. \"We all still get seasick. All you can do when you are in a bad storm is lie as low to the ground as you can and wait, \" says Dean Colbourne, 30. \"You can imagine what a relief it is to get off the ship and play a game of football on steady ground.\" The crew spends an average of seven months a year at sea, and they try to play a game in every port. Coach Jason Wallace, 35, is pleased with recent performances, but also nostalgic: \"On the HMS Albion we have a large landing deck. The markings are a bit like those on a football pitch, and in the past we have had great games of four-a-side on deck. But the current captain doesn't want us to play football at sea. I can see why: one athletic goal-line clearance and you'd be in the water.\" Sonali Othit FC Sonali Othit is an over-35s Asian all-star team, picked from various teams in east London. \"The idea,\" says manager Jamal Miah, \"is that we are the Bangladeshi national team outside Bangladesh.\" Their name translates as \"Golden Past\", which is misleading. For one, they are still a pretty decent side: on an Asian tour in 2004 they drew 2-2 against the actual Bangladesh team. And secondly, their memories of playing football in their 20s are anything but golden. They first formed in the late 70s, because many of them couldn't get into any regular teams - Asians, they were told, played only cricket. By 1996, they had built up the skills to play competitive matches: Sporting Bengal, the name of their side then, entered the East London League. Most of the teams they played against were pub sides who didn't come out to play football, but to have punch-ups. \"We experienced racism to the full-extent,\" says Zakir Khan. \"People standing on the sidelines with their dogs, shouting, 'Oi, Paki! You smell of curry!'\" But it wasn't as bad as what was happening on the pitch. \"Your opponent would spit at you - and the ref would just laugh.\" They knew how to fight back: by playing better football. Sonali Othit don't play kick and rush, but good passing football. \"Most of the time the other teams are just watching,\" says Miah. While the original Sporting Bengal players have gone on to form Sonali Othit, Sporting Bengal continues to exist and now also includes white and black players. They are currently fourth in their league and have even played in the early rounds of the FA cup. \"It's now just a matter of time,\" reckons Miah, \"until we have a British Asian playing for England.\" The Metaphysical Philosophers Scottish universities traditionally divide their philosophy faculties into two different departments: Logic and Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy. At St Andrews University, the two compete at the annual Edgecliffe Cup. Moral Philosophy used to come out top in these matches but, spurred on by provocative banners asking, \"What is logic anyway?\", Logic and Metaphysics last summer chalked up their first win in five years. If it all sounds a bit like Monty Python's philosophers' football sketch, then it is. At this year's match, play was stopped several times for intensive discussions about how to interpret the offside rule, concluding with a distinction between \"obvious offside\" and \"unobvious offside\". Philip Ebert, 31, goalscorer and lecturer in neo-Fregeanism, explains: \"As a philosopher, that's what you do. You try to make general statements about the world and see how they hold up.\" Perhaps moral anguish just doesn't make for good sportsmen, suggests captain Douglas Edwards, 24: \"I wasn't that surprised the Moral Philosophers lost, as a few of them played a large part of the game with cigarettes in their hands. There were clearly one or two existentialists on their team.\" The GB Deaf Women's team Few football fans would feel they were missing out if they had to watch a match on TV with the sound off. Playing football with the sound off is a different matter. Shouting at your players won't work. Blowing a whistle is useless (in deaf football, referees wave a big handkerchief when there has been a foul). The biggest problem, explains Carly Waters, goalkeeper for the Great Britain Women's deaf national side, is free-kicks: \"It's difficult to organise your back four into a wall: once they've turned their back on you, you can't change much. I usually shout at them anyway, even if they can't hear me.\" Waters' team was founded in 1999: every three months, players from across Britain gather to train together. Many of them have played in hearing teams in the past but felt ostracised. \"The other players used to tell me to shout my name when there was a high ball,\" recalls Damaris Cook. \"I still refuse to say it. If they hear nothing, they know it's my ball.\" Real Goth FC The Real Goth FC is a team of goth musicians. Twice a year, they play against a team of locals in Whitby, North Yorkshire, host to Europe's largest biannual goth festival and, according to Bram Stoker's novel, the place in which Dracula first set foot on British soil. Naturally, the team play in all-black shirts and shorts. The club crest is inspired by the Sisters Of Mercy logo, and they currently carry the logo of a gothic-themed lingerie label on their chests. Make-up is usually removed before matches and long hair tied in ponytails, even though Matt Helm remembers sporting dreadlocks one year and being able to take out \"up to three opponents at a time\". The match tradition started in 2004, when Mike Uwins, guitarist for Manuskript, got talking to a reporter from the Whitby Gazette. With their white face paint and bolted belts, Uwins admits, goths might have looked intimidating to the residents of Whitby - football changed that. \"The first match was a horribly drunken performance on our behalf. We lost 1-10, but once you've kicked lumps out of each other on the pitch, it's much easier to start a conversation.\" Nowadays pubs in Whitby carry signs reading \"Goths Welcome\". In April 2004, however, relations between goths and locals suffered a minor setback. Jim Moyle remembers: \"One of our players, Geoff, went for a high ball and clashed heads with the Whitby player. He left two teeth in his opponent's forehead. Given Whitby's Dracula connection, you can imagine the headlines.\" The Whitechapel Mission Street League team Few of the players are homeless in the sense that they sleep rough on park benches. They are in what the government classifies as a \"domestically unstable condition\": they have a bed to sleep in, even if it's not their own. \"If you didn't have a place to sleep or eat,\" says Frank Francisco, 21, \"you couldn't concentrate on the football. You'd be worrying constantly about where to go after training.\" Their problems are different: living in a hostel, you learn to distrust other people and fight for your own space, explains Rizwan Aboo, the team's coach. \"That's where the Street League comes in.\" A registered charity, it organises free training sessions and offers its young players a sense of structure, a way to get fit and an opportunity to make friends. \"It's difficult meeting people in London,\" says Francisco, who came to England from Angola six years ago. \"People concentrate very hard on going to work, they don't look left or right.\" There are a number of native East Enders, such as Paul White, but most players have made their way to London from other parts of the world. Goalkeeper Yasser Al-Samarraie, 25, arrived here from Iraq two years ago. In order to communicate with one another, he says, you have to make a special effort: \"I like making people laugh. Sometimes I will turn up to matches wearing a Superman costume.\" The Gurkha boys If you are born a Gurkha, you are always a Gurkha, even when you play football. \"We mostly just play friendlies and charity tournaments,\" says Adharsh Rai, 17, but every game is important to us. We represent the Gurkhas. The army is very important to our lives - through our fathers, it has been with us for ever.\" All of the boys in the team know each other well. Most were born in Nepal but have already moved to England and back several times in their lives. They all go to different schools near the Gurkha's army base in the Folkestone area. The Gurkhas are famed for their bravery on the battlefield. Few know about their highly developed sense of fair play in sports. At their last tournament, the Nations United Cup, the rules weren't properly explained to them before their game. They thought you weren't allowed to shoot from within the box, so in the first match they let their opposition score an easy goal. \"We didn't protest - that's not in our culture,\" says Bodhraj Gurung, 17. \"If the Gurkhas have shown one thing in the past, in the Falklands or in Malaysia, then that is that we can absorb a lot of bad fortune.\" UK Parliament FC Ed Balls, secretary of state for children, schools and families, and Andy Burnham, chief secretary to the Treasury, vie for the top scorer award upfront. Jim Murphy, minister for Europe, threads passes from midfield and Iain Duncan Smith (currently injured) organises the back four in this cross party side. UKPFC plays only charity matches, many of them against other national parliaments. In the past they have taken on Ireland, Germany and the Czech Republic. In Hungary they created a diplomatic incident when former MP Ivor Caplin floored the ex-Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n with a tackle. In general, players claim, they are a peace-loving bunch. Only at the annual match against the Press Association do things get nasty. But, hints James Purnell, defender and secretary of state for sport, media and culture, in football as in politics the toughest battles aren't fought out in the open: \"You don't have to worry so much about the sliding tackles. If your team mates don't pass you the ball, that's when you are in trouble.\" The Blind England team Blind football shouldn't work, but it does. Internationals are played as five-a-side matches. The goalie is fully sighted, but not allowed to move off his line. The four outfield players are blind, and they wear a blindfold to make sure there is no cheating. The ball is smaller than a normal football, and there is a pellet inside it that makes a rattling noise. The pitch is divided into three \"coaching zones\", into which the coaches on the sidelines can shout directions. To avoid serious injuries, there is an international rule whereby a player will shout the word \"voy\" before he goes in for a tackle. Football commentators often praise players for being able to \"read\" the game - blind footballers hear it. England captain Aj Ahmed, 26, holds a season ticket at Anfield. \"People ask me why I waste all that money when I could just listen to the matches on the radio, but they have no idea what it feels like to hear the crowd roar.\" When he plays, he says, it is similar: \"You can imagine the flight of the ball from the reaction of the crowds.\" Those players who have been blind since birth tend to have better ball control. Karyn Seal, 25, went blind only two years ago: \"I will still sometimes punt it forward and run after it.\" Striker David Clarke, on the other hand, knows how to keep the ball close to his body. His trademark move is a drag-back which ends with him flipping the ball over the defender's head - \"when it's in the air, the ball stops jingling and the opponent can't hear where it is\". At 36, he has represented England at international level for 14 years, won the Golden Boot at three different tournaments, and scored 78 goals in 87 matches - Michael Owen's record pales in comparison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
