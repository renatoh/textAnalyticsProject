Will &amp; Grace (Channel 5) is back! After an 11-year hiatus, the snarky foursome are in Will\u2019s apartment, playing a hyper-current game of Celebrity to remind us that we are in 2018. Unfortunately, there\u2019s even more scope for gags now than in 1998. Will: \u201cHe\u2019s a man but he\u2019s aged into a lesbian.\u201d Grace: \u201cNewt Gingrich?\u201d Will: \u201cWe want to love her but she makes it impossible.\u201d Grace: \u201cCaitlyn Jenner!\u201d The kind of man Karen worships is now president of the United States, but, apart from that, everything in the show \u2013 once credited with helping to educate Americans on same-sex marriage \u2013 is just the same. Ish. To get round the problem of reviving a classic but tired 90s network sitcom in the age of Trump, award-winning queer series (such as Transparent), and numerous other revivals, co-creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan return to the source: the camaraderie between Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. Thankfully, it\u2019s as sparky as ever. The limp season eight finale in which Will and Grace raised children separately is immediately dismissed as one of Karen\u2019s drug-addled nightmares. Instead, Grace is staying with Will for a couple of weeks until the dust has settled. (\u201cOn your genitals?\u201d Jack quips. \u201cOn my divorce,\u201d she retorts.) It\u2019s just like the noughties again, but with Grindr, some half-arsed attempts at being woke, and a president invoked by a packet of Cheetos but never actually named. The first episode is stuffed with more references to the present moment than there are nods to the 80s in two seasons of Stranger Things. This is either hilarious or trying way too hard, depending on your irony levels. Will ends up abandoning his principles to pursue a Republican congressman at an energy caucus. Grace goes against everything she believes in to decorate the Oval Office. \u201cHe wants it to look like he\u2019s there from time to time,\u201d Karen \u2013 who remains the best thing about Will &amp; Grace \u2013 advises. It all descends, as the best episodes of Will &amp; Grace always did, into camp farce, easily digestible satire, and a pillow fight in the White House. Whether a series that was once radical in its centre-stage representation of gay people can keep up the pace and relevance is another matter. For now, there is something deeply comforting about watching smart, queer characters being their usual irrepressible selves. \u201cThis time, everything will be exactly the same,\u201d Will promises Grace. Everything except the entire political landscape."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
