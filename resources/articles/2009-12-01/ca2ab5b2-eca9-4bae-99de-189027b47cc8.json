England looked safe at tea at 169 for three after Kevin Pietersen (81) and Jonathan Trott (69) had batted throughout the middle session. But then Pietersen ran himself out and when South Africa took the new ball at 201 for four it immediately accounted for Trott when Friedel de Wet's brilliant lifting, leaving delivery was matched by an even more breathtaking slip catch by AB de Villiers. The pressure was too much for Ian Bell for the second time in the match and his wicket was quickly followed by those of Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and man of the match Graeme Swann before Collingwood and Onions survived the last 19 deliveries. But Onions had to see out the last six balls after Collingwood had taken a silly single near the end of the penultimate over. \"In the last over I was just thinking please, please don't get out, because it would have been my fault,\" said Collingwood. \"But 'Bunny' [as in bunions] played exceptionally well. I knew he had a reasonable technique. He keeps bragging that he's got the best bat in the changing room so I was shouting that down the pitch to remind him of that. He was very relaxed for a guy who hadn't been in a position like that.\" A relieved England captain, Andrew Strauss, said: \"I hate it when the No11 batsman has to get out of jail. But Pietersen and Trott played exceptionally well.\" The South Africa captain, Graeme Smith, said that he had been taken aback by England's celebrations after the match. \"I was a bit surprised by the fist-pumping at the end,\" he said. \"That was maybe a little bit much.\" He added that he had been annoyed by his compatriot Trott, who regularly took excessive time to prepare himself for the bowler. \"It's been a constant thing throughout the one-day series and the Test match. I'm all for a batsman taking his time to be ready. I'm not the quickest at the crease myself in setting up. But when a bowler has to keep stopping for a batter throughout the game \u2013 and he's been warned in a one-day game and he was warned again today \u2013 it's frustrating.\" Smith insisted that South Africa were not dejected by the result. \"There's a touch of frustration but not disappointment because all the excitement in the dressing room is about having bowled so well and got so close. It gives us momentum going into the next Test. We played the better cricket throughout the Test match. This has set up a terrific series.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
