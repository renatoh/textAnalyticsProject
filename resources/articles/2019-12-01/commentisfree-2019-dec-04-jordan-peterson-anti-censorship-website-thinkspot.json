Part Facebook/Twitter-styled social media site, part Patreon/Kickstarter-modelled crowdfunding platform, Thinkspot was born out of a purported crisis in free speech. In late 2018, Patreon booted a slew of fringe conservatives and \u201calt-right\u201d figures \u2013 including British far-right agitator Milo Yiannopoulos, anti-feminist YouTuber and failed Ukip hopeful Carl Benjamin, and Canadian white nationalist conspiracy theorist Lauren Southern \u2013 from their website. Jordan Peterson was disconsolate, believing the bans were politically motivated, constituting a galling affront to the sanctity of free expression. In the wake of the \u201cPatreon Purge\u201d Peterson announced the \u201cestablishment of a Patreon-like enterprise that will not be susceptible to arbitrary censorship\u201d. And so, almost a year later, enter Thinkspot: the place where self-identifying members of the so-called intellectual dark web (IDW) can gather to agree on the importance of reason, lament the blight of postmodernism, and share beef jerky recipes. Peterson, it should be said, has proved particularly adept at exploiting crises in free expression where none actually exist. He emerged from obscurity in 2016 over his opposition to Bill C-16, a Canadian amendment to the human rights act and criminal code outlawing harassment on the basis of gender identity. \u201cIf they fine me, I won\u2019t pay it,\u201d he told a Canadian public access show. \u201cIf they put me in jail, I\u2019ll go on a hunger strike.\u201d He remains, as of this writing, not only unjailed but enormously wealthy, having been propelled to international celebrity. He subsists, of his own volition, pretty much entirely on steak. As someone who has followed the rise of Peterson, who has written and spoken critically of him in the past, and who has received personal emails from his slavish acolytes threatening to beat me up, I found the prospect of Thinkspot almost perversely fascinating. I instantly registered for the beta test of the site. Left languishing in the queue, I pressed a friend for access. Logging into the site provided a dull thrill, like crashing a very boring party to which I was not officially invited. I skimmed the Free Speech Statement (\u201cwithout fertile ground for free expression, our purest exhibition of free will congeals into a reductive calcification \u2026 \u201d), expecting a refuge far away from the accursed meddling \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d, where big brains can hash out dangerous ideas without fear of reprisal and where the speech couldn\u2019t be freer. As it turns out, being \u201cfree speech warriors\u201d is rather expensive. Registering as a Thinkspot \u201ccontributor\u201d costs $2.50 (\u00a31.90) a month, while \u201cunlocking\u201d content from certain big-name Thinkspot contributors will set you back considerably more. Unsurprisingly, Professor Peterson proves the biggest ticket. Access to all his posts costs $240 annually (beta users get 50% off). Second priciest is Mikhaila Peterson, his daughter and fellow all-beef diet apostle, whose current video offerings include the above mentioned jerky recipe. Without paying for contributor access, Thinkspot users can only comment on the contributor-created content, reduced to second-class-citizen status as mere fans. Indeed, Thinkspot feels very much like a pay-to-play Jordan Peterson fan site. Reposts of video lectures from the \u201cPeterson academia archives\u201d are accompanied with descriptions so wildly high-flown that they veer into parody. Stuff like: \u201cThe lecture is an exercise in mastery, both of technique and analysis, as Peterson commands a symphony of material across centuries and various analytical frameworks.\u201d Do such worshipful, obsequious descriptions, I wonder, meaningfully constitute the \u201cpurest exhibition of free will\u201d, or rather the sort of \u201creductive calcification\u201d that turn anti-PC psychology professors into rarefied authorities, lecturing eclectically, fingers flittering wildly, in the cozy confines of their paywalled gardens? More than anything, however, Thinkspot puts me in mind of that joke from The Simpsons where Marge bakes and decorates a totally superfluous cake in an effort to dissuade Homer from ruining his daughter\u2019s actual birthday cake. In the social media ecosystem, Thinkspot feels very much like that ad hoc dummy pastry: a place where the alt-lite-affiliated, the self-mythologising provocateurs of the ludicrously named intellectual dark web, the \u201crace realists\u201d and conspiracy theorists and tedious dullards who believe themselves oppressed simply because they\u2019re disliked, can mix with like-minded others. There they can exchange and annotate their self-important manifestos, grifting each other for subscription fees to unlock highly exclusive and surely incendiary content, and leaving the rest of us well enough alone. \u2022 John Semley is the author of Hater: On the Virtues of Utter Disagreeability"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
