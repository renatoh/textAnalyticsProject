The chestnut's chances appeared to be improved by the news that Paco Boy will not be among his rivals this weekend. A cautious O'Brien insisted his plans had not yet been finalised, but conditions will suit his runner and he is understandably keen to add to the two Group Ones the horse has already won in Britain this year. \"At the moment, we're looking at coming,\" O'Brien said. \"If everything's OK in the morning, he'll be there.\" The trainer added that Rip Van Winkle, Cape Blanco and Beethoven are likely to represent him in the Irish Champion Stakes on Saturday. Fame And Glory is likely to be saved for the Prix Foy the following weekend. Meanwhile, connections of Paco Boy have decided against tackling top-class sprinters at Haydock with a horse who normally races over a mile. \"It now looks almost certain that we are going to give the Sprint Cup a miss and wait for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on Sunday,\" said his trainer, Richard Hannon. Hannon pointed out that the field for the Moulin will probably be limited to single figures and will not include the crack French miler Goldikova, who is being saved for next month's Prix de la For\u00eat. Makfi, who beat Paco Boy at Deauville last month, may line up but Hannon feels his horse could turn the form around on a sounder surface. There was positive news of the Derby winner, Workforce, who has not raced since flopping in the King George in July. The colt, who has done little on the gallops since then, did a steady piece of work yesterday and there is now \"a reasonable chance\" that he will run again this year. \"It was nothing searching but he moved nicely and was stretching out well over the ground,\" said a spokesman for his owner, Khalid Abdulla. \"If he were to go for the Arc, I would think he would have a racecourse gallop beforehand.\" Ryan Moore, Workforce's regular rider, is finally expected to return to the saddle at Salisbury today, having been sidelined for three weeks by a badly bruised wrist. There will be no repeat of the stunt by Irish bookmakers Paddy Power which saw a giant sign bearing their name dominate the Cheltenham skyline during the March Festival. The firm has agreed with the course not to do it again and has extended its sponsorship at the track's November meeting until 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
