The singer walked into the Santa Maria courthouse as a throng of reporters and photographers watched. There was no large crowd of fans, but two people demonstrated on the drizzly morning in support of the prosecution. Judge Rodney Melville read the indictment to the jury, the first time the public has heard the full list of ten charges against him. The singer stands accused molesting a 13-year-old boy, giving him wine, and conspiring to prevent him and his family from leaving his Neverland ranch. Mr Jackson, 46, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecuting attorney Thomas Sneddon set out the case against Mr Jackson to the jury, saying the singer exploited a 13-year-old boy and exposed him to \"strange sexual behaviour\". Mr Sneddon referred to the boy by name after telling the court it would be impossible to proceed without using the real names of the child and his family. Mr Sneddon is expected to call British television journalist Martin Bashir as the prosecution's first witness. Mr Bashir's documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, showed the singer holding hands with the boy, who is now 15. Opening statements began after Mr Melville read the indictment to the jury, revealing the names of five unindicted alleged co-conspirators. All are employees of Mr Jackson. The judge also read out 28 overt acts allegedly committed in a conspiracy surrounding the alleged molestation of the boy, a cancer patient, and a purported attempt to keep his family silent. The credibility of the boy, now 15, and his family will be a key element of Mr Jackson's defence. The prosecution's story depicts a poor family whose son was suffering from cancer. His wish to meet one of his idols was granted when he was invited to Mr Jackson's home in the coastal mountains 170 miles north of Los Angeles. The defence narrative casts Mr Jackson as the target of a money-hungry mother who coached her son to spin stories when it looked like their celebrity benefactor would cut them off. The defence will present evidence that the mother had previously made a claim of abuse against staff at a department store. The store settled out of court with her for $150,000. \"The bigger the star, the bigger the target,\" Mr Jackson said during a recent television interview with Geraldo Rivera, suggesting his defence. Mr Jackson's lawyer suggested to jurors that celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Stevie Wonder would testify on behalf of the pop star. More than 1,000 members of the media from around the world have credentials to cover the trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
