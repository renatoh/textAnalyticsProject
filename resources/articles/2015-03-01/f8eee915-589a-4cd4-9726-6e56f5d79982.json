To play it keenly, honourably, generously, self-sacrificingly, is a moral lesson in itself and the classroom is God\u2019s air and sunshine. Foster it, my brothers, so that it may attract all who can find time to play it; protect it from anything that would sully it, so that it may grow in favour with all men.\u201d Lord Harris former English Test Cricketer and Governor of Bombay, 1931. Tempe Reserve in Sydney\u2019s South is not a glamorous sporting venue, located next to Sydney Airport and its symphony of screaming turbines. Most weekends this hardscrabble green space plays host to a range of sports - today it is women\u2019s cricket. On an overcast Saturday afternoon the North West Sydney Hurricanes are taking on Universities Blue in the Sydney Cricket Association Women\u2019s Third Grade Twenty20 competition. Women make up 22% of cricket\u2019s participants in Australia, but the North West Sydney Hurricanes look different to most women\u2019s grade teams. The majority of players hail from the subcontinent, and for most of them it\u2019s their first year of formal cricket. Having made 88 in their innings, the Hurricanes are fielding and Prashant Jhala, their tall, slightly intense Indian Australian coach circles the boundary, providing ball by ball encouragement to his team. A Level 2 coach and physiotherapist by day he takes his role very seriously. \u201cGood bruise, wear it with pride,\u201d says Jhala to Hurricanes boundary fielder Dilani Gunawardena as she takes a thudding ball to the ribs. \u201cWomen\u2019s cricket is so positive with the camaraderie as important as wins and losses,\u201d says Jhala, whose enthusiasm for the women\u2019s game is infectious. \u201cNot many people know but it was a women\u2019s cricket tour that helped heal Australian-English relations after Bodyline!\u201d The team started in a rush in 2014, backed by two men\u2019s clubs, the North West Sydney Hurricanes men\u2019s team and the Lankan Islanders community club. The founders were a group of Sri Lankan women who were joined by Anglo, Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani players. With no grassroots women\u2019s cricket league in Sydney, the Hurricanes were thrust straight into third grade, hard-ball cricket against lifelong cricketers. In their third game of the season, the entire team was dismissed for one run, their solitary run coming from an extra. They overcame this early setback and Jhala is proud of the Hurricanes\u2019 improvement: three months later they registered their first win. Charging in to bowl is Janu Gnanamurthy, the tall Indian Tamil opening bowler who before this year had never bowled a ball in her life. When Jhala started teaching throwing mechanics he knew she was a natural. \u201cShe can swing the ball and troubles the male grade players at practice. That\u2019s a massive achievement.\u201d Coach Jhala has strong views on building team culture, something which attracted Andrea Tyler to have a go. Tyler originally joined the team as fitness coach and was so motivated by the team\u2019s passion that she signed up and has developed into a key leader and batsman. \u201cWe have four clear rules,\u201d explains Jhala. \u201cEverybody has a nickname, we provide afternoon tea for the opposing team, we don\u2019t tolerate negativity in any form and it\u2019s not about results its about personal development. This breeds a positive culture and you see it when a catch goes down, everybody gets behind whoever dropped it. We constantly reinforce that everyone is developing at their own rate and they have a total support structure, no matter what happens.\u201d Jhala is joined on the boundary by Pradhima Jeyaratnam, a Sri Lankan Tamil woman checking out her first game. She\u2019s a hockey player but has a deep love of cricket, having played in school and in the backyard with her family and friends. \u201cMy husband is supportive and I can\u2019t wait to play,\u201d she says. England\u2019s mythical Cricket on the Village Green in its purest form was a gathering of the men of various occupations: the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker. The Hurricanes have echoed this tradition with a 21st century flavour, covering many professions including speech pathologist, lawyer, engineer, accountant, musician, teacher, IT, doctor, economist and their captain and team mentor Kirsten Wraith who is studying to join the Federal Police. After some lusty hitting, the Universities Blue team reach 89 runs to win with four wickets down and after handshakes, the Hurricanes gather around Kirsten and Jhala, coach and captain together, clapping each player for their contributions. A question for the two umpires: \u201cTough day fellas. Any players on report?\u201d Based on their smiles, John and Rajesh didn\u2019t endure too testing a day at the office. What\u2019s the difference umpiring men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket? \u201cIt\u2019s not dog eat dog,\u201d replies John, a dentist by day. \u201cIn men\u2019s cricket when a batsman is hit, they stand over him and make comments. In women\u2019s cricket they rush in to help.\u201d With the post mortem complete, Coach Jhala invites me to their next home game against Parramatta, this time at their home ground in Bella Vista in the heartland of Sydney\u2019s Hills Shire. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling we\u2019ll win it!\u201d he said with a wink as he leaves the ground. Two weeks later the Hurricanes face Parramatta in a wooden spoon showdown on a hot day at the Bella Vista cricket oval, a nice suburban ground with a crisp white picket fence, newish pavilion and a McMansion skyline view. The Hurricanes are feeling the benefits of home ground advantage, with their captain and star bowler Wraith on fire, tearing through the Parramatta batting with figures of 5 for 6 including four wickets in one over. Parramatta are dismissed for 49 and the Hurricanes seem relaxed and confident as they prepare for their innings. Jhala warms up his two openers with \u201cthrowdowns\u201d \u2013 \u201cRemember! Smart cricket, pick your ball,\u201d he tells them. With the backdrop of the Cricket World Cup in Australia though, it\u2019s hard to keep minds on the task at hand. \u201cSome of [the women] met the Sri Lankan team at a dinner during the week and its all they want to talk about. As coach, focus has been an ongoing challenge,\u201d Jhala adds. The Hurricanes team sit in a row on the sideline and enjoy a mini party. Verses of Will Smith\u2019s classic Fresh Prince of Bel-Air song are spontaneously belted out, which I learn is their official team song. Every run is cheered, every blocked shot draws a blast of positive comments. The match takes on a nice rhythm and to add to the suspense, a few wickets fall including the captain Wraith for a hard fought 11. Coach Jhala relentlessly works with the awaiting batsmen throwing balls to warm them up and drilling them with simple advice: \u201cBe patient, cash in on the key scoring ball.\u201d On the sideline, I am joined by one of the Hurricanes\u2019 fans, Harry, here to support his girlfriend, wicketkeeper and vice-captain Fiona De Silva Weerawardena. He is amazed that a group of women who didn\u2019t know each other before the season have become so tight. To break some of the tension Harry announces to the team: \u201cEleven required off eight overs. Ladies at this run rate we\u2019ll win.\u201d Not wanting to tempt fate, they shout him down, one screaming, \u201cEnough of your freaky maths Harry!\u201d The final runs are scored, triggering howls of joy for the team\u2019s second victory of the year. The Parramatta team graciously provides a guard of honour and cheer as the Hurricanes leave the field. It is cricket in all its original genteel finery. Amidst the celebrations Wraith, the team\u2019s most experienced cricketer, says with a big smile, \u201cI\u2019ve helped rep teams before but this is my first club team. I\u2019m in awe of them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never been part of a team that sings and dances on the field, always laughing. And what improvement! At the start of the season some of them couldn\u2019t throw five metres.\u201d Jhala takes the team into the change rooms for their team-talk and after lots of clapping and hollering returns with a smile. \u201cNow we can talk about the World Cup,\u201d he says, relieved. The team bursts into excited chat about Sri Lanka\u2019s chances, the names of their stars peppering the exchanges \u2013 Sangakkara, Mathews, Jayawardene, Dilshan, Malinga. One player Nadishi Athulathmudali is particularly excited: \u201cI booked my tickets over a year ago and I\u2019ve been counting the days. I actually dream about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
