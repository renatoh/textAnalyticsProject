You can start with eight days of inflatable kayaking, whitewater rafting and snorkelling in the highlands of Viti Levu, where two of the world's most amazing tropical rivers carve through canyons. Then move to the island of Savusavu which is much less developed and offers great hiking and diving. The Jean Michel Cousteau Resort has dive courses for novices. From Savusavu, one of the best ways to explore the islands is by boat. Bridge &amp; Wickers has a four-night cruise aboard a schooner called Tui Tai with small-group walking and biking excursions to waterfalls, scenic lookout points and villages. JS Go east, away from the tourist resorts and in-your-face hawkers of Nadi. Ovalau, a volcanic island east of Suva, has a great community of real Fijians/Indians. Levuka has some great places to stay. Regardless of where you stay, local guide Epi will seek you out to join him on a day-trip walking to his village, Lovoni, which sits in the crater in the middle of the island. You'll end up going with a small group of other travellers (limited to however many can fit in the van that takes you to the starting point), which is good because Epi stops to explain the culinary and medicinal uses of plants along the way and everyone is within earshot. After about an hour's walk the track clears a saddle and descends into Lovoni where the group offers a gift to the village chief (usually kava - yangona - which you've bought in Levuka and has probably been grown in Lovoni ...) and then is welcomed in return. The group is then treated to lunch in a villager's house while Epi recounts the history of the village. After lunch, he will show you around the village and perhaps take you to the swimming hole for a dip. Then it's time to return by van. It's a great trip which gives a good idea of how locals live. For pictures, see triciamcinroy.com/ world_adventur/Page_16x.html. Levuka is also the departing point for the island of Caqelai (pronounced 'Thangelai'). It has basic accommodation and meals provided by a local family. It takes 10 minutes to walk around and has amazing coral to snorkel around. Kathryn Bates The Garden Island Resort on Taveuni (aquatrek.com/gir.html) offers reasonably priced dorms and hotel-style rooms. The staff are lovely and they can organise all kinds of excursions including walks to Lake Tagimoucia and birdwatching trips up De Voeux Peak. Snorkelling and diving are great: I did the open-water course there. I would also recommend the Bouma Falls and Lavena walks.
