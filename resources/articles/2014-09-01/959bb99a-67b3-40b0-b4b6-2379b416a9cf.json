Wallace\u2019s music exactly echoes her unsettling but deceptively simple lyrics, and Moule\u2019s cool voice brings them both to elegant life. Among the seven Landesman songs here I particularly liked Scars and Did I Break Your Heart? There\u2019s also Lots of People Do, with a lyric that sounds remarkably like Fran but turns out to be by Julie Burchill, together with several intriguingly recast standards. Wallace\u2019s arrangements are immaculate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
