Nearly half a million pounds will go to help re-skill workers and create new business opportunities in Cumbria, which claims to have suffered from more than 1,200 lay-offs in the past six months. The Wirral is to receive \u00a3140,000 to help local communities deal with the fallout from more than 400 redundancies recently announced by shipbuilder Cammel Laird. The bid was put together by the local training and enterprise council. The funding, from the government's rapid response fund, is usually earmarked for areas that have suffered from one major industrial closure, such as that of steel giant Corus's Llanwern plant. But the government has made an exception for Cumbria in recognition of the impact that a stream of redundancies from more than six companies are having on the county's economy. Cumbria council leader Stewart Young said: \"This news will act as a major boost to those areas in west Cumbria and Carlisle that are dealing with the recent spate of job losses It's terrible when someone loses their job through redundancy. Being able to offer practical help to get people retrained and supported through the difficult time as they come to terms with what has happened is essential.\" The county put forward its bid in partnership with local employment agencies. The partnership will now have to find training and development agencies on which to spend the cash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
