For the top echelon of British rugby league, that is, where they had belonged for most of their 107-year history until they were frozen out of the Super League in 1995. On Saturday night they will finally reach their destination, with their first-ever Super League match at home to St Helens. But they are now approaching it with as much trepidation as anticipation. That is down to the Challenge Cup, a competition which has been good to Widnes over the years, with their seven Wembley wins second only to Wigan. But in its new position, with the early rounds as a curtain-raiser to the Super League, the cup has kicked the Chemics in the teeth. Widnes's home fifth-round tie against Wakefield Trinity last Sunday, in front of the BBC cameras, should have been the ideal stage to announce to the nation their return and the transformation of ramshackle Naughton Park into the smart new Halton Stadium. Instead they lost 12-4 in a dreadful game in front of a crowd of 3,500 - fewer fans than have bought Super League season tickets. Suddenly a fixture list which pits Widnes against Castleford, then Bradford, after the visit of Saints, looks daunting rather than exciting. \"I wouldn't say that; it's more of a waking-up call for everyone,\" said Frank Myler, the last Great Britain captain to win the Ashes, who has been Widnes's football secretary throughout the dark days since 1993. \"It's shown our supporters what we're going to be up against this season and might make expectations a bit more realistic.\" Those expectations had included suggestions that Widnes could reach Super League's expanded top-six play-offs even though they are the first team to have been promoted from the Northern Ford Premiership since Wakefield in 1998. Neil Kelly, the Yorkshireman who took over as coach midway through last season and plotted their surge from mid-table in the NFP to victory over Oldham in the grand final, sums up the place of the Cheshire town, with its belching chemical works and grand suspension bridge across the Mersey, in the game's folklore. \"Last year after I'd met the committee and agreed terms and signed the contract, as I drove back home to Wakefield I thought 'Bloomin' heck, I'm coach of Widnes'. And to me Widnes is a great club. I've grown up watching them play in cup finals, world club championships, John Players, Premiership games. They were probably at their best at the time I was learning the game, so for me to be coach of Widnes is like getting the Man United job in soccer.\" But if it were not for the local Halton council's recognition that rugby league is the only rival to Paul Simon and perhaps ICI for putting Widnes on the map, they might never have risen from the ashes. In 1995, when the British game signed up with BSkyB for its switch to a summer Super League, Widnes were counting the cost of the success they had enjoyed over the previous two decades. Under the coaching of Doug Laughton they had raided rugby union for Alan Tait, John Devereux, Jonathan Davies, Paul Moriarty, Martin Offiah and many more, and played some dazzling rugby to deny Wigan the championship two years running in the late 80s, adding the World Club Challenge with a memorable victory over Canberra Raiders at Old Trafford in 1989. But as Kelly says: \"They've had success that they couldn't afford.\" Phil Larder was the first to grapple with financial realism at Naughton Park, and still guided them to Wembley in 1993, when they went closer than anyone to ending Wigan's long winning run. But two years later he had left for Keighley and the club had sunk to the bottom six of the First Division. Crucially, that meant they were below the cut-off for Super League and were denied access to most of the Murdoch millions. The future looked bleak, but it was then that Tony Chambers took over as chairman and, with a group of like-minded directors, made the tough decisions that saved the club. Meanwhile Halton council was planning to transform Naughton Park, and in 1998 the first of three new stands had been built. It has been a long road back, but those stands should be packed on Saturday, with the possibility of a 10,400 full house forcing Widnes to make the game all-ticket. If the team play as poorly against Saints as they did against Wakefield, however, they may wish they were bound for the NFP again. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
