Asked if she had considered \u201coffering her services\u201d to the triple\u2011slam champion at the All England Club when the championships start on 1 July, she laughed and said: \u201cIt makes me sound like a hooker.\u201d She added: \u201cI haven\u2019t really given it any thought. He has had some offers and some have said \u2018no\u2019. I just assume that is because they are focusing on different things. He hasn\u2019t asked me yet so I\u2019ve not thought about it. I\u2019d have to speak to my coaches because I haven\u2019t thought about mixed doubles, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Murray seems no closer to finding a partner in the mixed, although he surely will not be left standing friendless at the gates when entries close on the eve of the tournament. Ashleigh Barty, the new French Open champion, has already turned him down, reluctantly, saying she was honoured to be asked but did not want to risk overload as she strove for another singles title. Konta, who is preparing for the Nature Valley Championships in her home town of Eastbourne, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t watched Andy at Queen\u2019s. I\u2019ve seen some highlights on social media and I have seen how excited he is to be back on court which is brilliant to see.\u201d Murray said earlier in the week, self-mockingly: \u201cI have spoken to a couple of players. I\u2019ve been rejected a couple of times so far.\u201d Nevertheless, Maria Sharapova and Barbora Str\u00fdcov\u00e1 are among those who would be keen to play with Murray, whose main objective will be to go deep in the men\u2019s doubles, alongside the Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert. This week he will warm up at Eastbourne partnering the excellent Brazilian, Marcelo Melo, who won the Wimbledon title with Lukasz Kubot in 2017. Whatever the banter, Murray is serious about winning a title on his return to tennis after five months recuperating from his second hip operation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
