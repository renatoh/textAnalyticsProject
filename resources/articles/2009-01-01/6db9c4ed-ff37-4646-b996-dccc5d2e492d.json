Although the Christmas talks with Gerhard Zeiler, chief executive of RTL, which owns Channel 5, were described by Channel 4 as \"preliminary \u2026 [and] unlikely to lead to a merger\", they will fuel speculation that the government is looking to privatise the state-owned but advert-funded broadcaster as part of a radical overhaul of public service television to be unveiled in the next two weeks. Yet Carter is also understood to have encouraged BBC executives to discuss a possible tie-up of the corporation's commercial assets with Channel 4 so as to consider all the options. These could include other companies taking stakes in a broadcaster that remains publicly owned. Talks with BBC Worldwide are understood to have been effectively shelved amid criticism from BBC executives that it would create a \"Frankenstein\" company without any commercial logic. In an exclusive interview with MediaGuardian, Johnson stressed that a merger of some kind with Worldwide was still Channel 4's preferred option and that he was optimistic that the government and the media regulator, Ofcom, would back it in a series of reports coming out in the next few weeks. Johnson said: \"[A merger with Five] is not our preferred option. We don't think it makes sense and ultimately I don't think it's one that either Ofcom or indeed Stephen Carter ... will recommend as a permanent substantial answer to the funding deficit we face for public service broadcasting.\" Andy Duncan, Channel 4's chief executive, this week dismissed a merger with Five, calling it \"mixing oil and water\". He did not attend merger talks with the channel. Johnson said he went into the talks with an \"open mind\", but he has also admitted: \"Having done due diligence before, we can't see how it makes economic or cultural sense. It makes even less sense now. Clearly we would like to see a friendly solution where everyone agrees and it's all cosy. That might be somewhat difficult to achieve but with a bit of persuasion we could get to a negotiated settlement.\" Ofcom is due to publish a report on service broadcasting next week, in which it will discuss how to subsidise news, current affairs and other public service television once the analogue signal is switched off in 2012. The review was partly prompted by Channel 4's calls for public funding to plug a deficit it sees developing to as much as \u00a3150m a year by 2012, as advertisers flock to more purely entertainment shows. The following week Carter's department is to publish a report on \"digital Britain\", which is expected to call for a radical overhaul of funding mechanisms. This is a draft report that will not conclude until May, but it is expected to reject the idea of direct public funding for Channel 4 via the licence fee, in favour of improving the country's broadband infrastructure. Although a merger with Five is always seen as the most likely option in the event of any privatisation, Carter is keen to explore creative solutions. \"Stephen Carter is keen on a big-picture solution, not a backwards-looking, small, temporary, sticking plaster,\" said Johnson. Having been on the board when, five years ago, the channel called off talks with Five, Johnson said such a merger would be even more disastrous for Channel 4 now since the economic case had \"diminished\" in the past five years, making a merger of \"two companies with problems into one company with a bigger problem\". He added: \"It would be a tragedy. It would, to a fair degree, make my tenure as chairman a failure.\" A story in yesterday's Financial Times about Carter's support for Channel 4 to be put into a \"wider entity\" was seen as support for a merger. Officials called the leak \"a very early draft\". Johnson said: \"There is still everything to play for.\" Zeiler and RTL have made no secret of their desire to buy a larger broadcaster in the UK, fulfilling a strategic requirement to be among the top two broadcasters in any territory. To this, Johnson said: \"Why should we use taxpayers' assets to help a private German company?\" \u2022 Full interview with Luke Johnson in Monday's Media Guardian"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
