The highlights show cuts most of the repetitive tedium, snow adds aesthetic pleasure (revel in the landscape in that one where they march for miles like penguins on planks), and there's a curious sense of satisfaction in watching toned young Aryans wrap their bodies in multicoloured cling film and chuck themselves off a glacier. And then there's curling. The finest winter sport of them all. It's chess, it's bowls, it's impossibly gripping. On ice. With brooms. Which makes its absence from the new Vancouver 2010 inexplicable. Doubly so when considering the pretty much one-dimensional nature of most winter sports. Almost all of them boil down to bunging on the clingfilm and going downwards as fast as possible. The video game equivalents necessarily have to mirror this, especially in the officially licensed product. So of the 14 events on offer, seven involve reaching sea level as fast as possible on pieces of wood and three by leaping on a lump of metal and careering down a frozen water slide. Fair enough, it's what the Winter Olympics is all about. But unfortunately that, largely, is pretty one-dimensional. Graphically, it's pleasing: the sensation of speed well-represented, nice snowflakes etc. The controls are well thought-out and it is fun skiing, sledding or boarding down the mountain. Just not for long. Once mastered, the limited number of courses combines with the fact that 10 of the events are a mixture of two basic themes, so there's little incentive to play again. Of the other disciplines, speed skating requires furious button-pressing (entertaining, but only if actually furious); 1,500m skating \u2013 rhythmic button-pressing (a thousand times more fun on Guitar Hero); while aerials and ski jumping \u2013 accurately timed pressing of buttons (easily mastered, belying the complex nature of both). They add variety, as does the challenge mode (offering specific goal-based takes on the sports), but just not enough. What's missing? Well, a score-based free snowboarding option; biathlon would have added shooting to the mix; even a basic ice hockey sim is usually a winner. Fun could have been had with figure skating and, of course, curling would have brought a change of pace and the perfect multiplayer challenge (offered in glorious broom-against-a-stranger fun at playcurling.com). Vancouver 2010 is a missed opportunity: there's not really enough here for a half-decent post-pub highlights show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
