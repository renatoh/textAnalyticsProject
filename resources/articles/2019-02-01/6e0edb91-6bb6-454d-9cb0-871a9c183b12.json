In a statement on Tuesday the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said infusions of plasma from young donors into older clients \u201cshould not be assumed to be safe or effective\u201d, and said it was \u201cconcerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors\u201d charging thousands of dollars for transfusions. Over the past two years there have been reports of a number of startups charging thousands of dollars for the transfusion of young people\u2019s blood, claiming that the treatment could improve strength and memory and even combat Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease. The best known company, Ambrosia, appeared to have immediately shut down following the FDA announcement. \u201cThe FDA has recently become aware of reports of establishments in several states that are offering infusions of plasma from young donors to purportedly treat the effects of a variety of conditions,\u201d the agency said. \u201cSuch treatments have no proven clinical benefits for the uses for which these clinics are advertising them and are potentially harmful. \u201cThere are reports of bad actors charging thousands of dollars for infusions that are unproven and not guided by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials.\u201d Ambrosia had been the subject of a number of news articles for offering blood transfusions for $8,000. The blood was mostly taken from teenagers, and pumped into anyone over the age of 35 who was willing to pay. Ambrosia\u2019s founder, Jesse Karmazin, claimed that recipients reported feeling stronger and having improved memory. Many experts disagreed. As recently as December Ambrosia was \u2013 according to Karmazin \u2013 planning to open its first clinic, in New York City, however the Huffington Post reported that Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer had both left the company that month, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee. \u201cIn compliance with the FDA announcement issued February 19, 2019, we have ceased patient treatments,\u201d Ambrosia said on its website. Karmazin did not respond to requests for comment. The FDA said the risks of transfusions included allergic reactions, \u201ctransfusion associated circulatory overload\u201d and potentially contracting infectious disease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
