The fragility of democracy worldwide, they write, will continue to be an issue \u201cirrespective of who wins the American presidency\u201d. \u201cWhether Donald J Trump is a fascist, a post-fascist populist, an autocrat or just a bumbling opportunist, the danger to democracy did not arrive with his presidency and goes well beyond 3 November 2020,\u201d the scholars write, referring to election day on Tuesday, when Trump will face Joe Biden at the polls. However, the historians warn, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthe temptation to take refuge in a figure of arrogant strength is now greater than ever\u201d. They suggest citizens must be ready not only to defend democracy at the ballot box, but \u201cif necessary, also through non-violent protests in the streets\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson, to not be complacent in moments like this,\u201d said Jennifer Evans, a professor of German history at Carleton University in Canada and one of the lead organizers of the open letter. \u201cThis is a very dangerous time, and we all have a responsibility to prop up democracy.\u201d Among the many warning signs that democracy is at risk, the historians argue, are the spread of disinformation, inequality, the \u201cpolitics of internal enemies\u201d and politically motivated violence. \u201cWe need to reveal and denounce any and all connections between those in power and those vigilante and militia forces using political violence to destabilize our democracies,\u201d the letter urges. Evans said she was particularly disturbed by the evidence of \u201cthe infiltration of the far right\u201d in police and military organizations around the world, including in the US, Germany, and Canada. Signatories to the letter include several authors who have commented on authoritarianism and fascism during Trump\u2019s presidency, including Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor at New York University, and Jason Stanley, the author of How Fascism Works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
