The company also completed the $1.6bn (\u00a3910m) purchase of US business Transkaryotic Therapies, which develops treatments for rare genetic disorders. Shire said its sales grew 32% in the second quarter to $425m, helped by strong growth of its best-selling amphetamine, Adderall, used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This drug comprises nearly half the company's sales. Shire also benefited from its new drug Fosrenol, which helps patients on kidney dialysis. It was launched in January and has taken an 8% market share in the United States. Chief executive Matthew Emmens said this was twice as good as rival drug Renagel, made by Genzyme, after the same period of time on the market. \"We continue to deliver on our promises, achieving good financial results and meeting key strategic milestones,\" he said. Shire's profits rose 30% to $141m - discounting the effects of a division sale last year. Finance director Angus Russell said there would be no provision for the potential increased payment to rebel shareholders in TKT. They are planning to ask a US court to force Shire to pay more. Shire had cash of $1.6bn at the end of last year, but it will be used to buy TKT. Shire's shares were unchanged yesterday at 655p. Irish firm Elan also reported yesterday. However, it gave no update on its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, which was pulled from sale this year after the deaths of two patients from a rare brain disease. The drug had been seen as the saviour of the indebted firm. Its loss in the second quarter widened to $143.5m against $104.9m last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
