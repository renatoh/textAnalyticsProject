Three judges at the appeals court in Porto Alegre voted unanimously on Wednesday to uphold the sentence that Lula was handed by a lower court, and increased the penalty from nine and a half years to 12 years and one month. The ruling prompted protests across Brazil, and protesters set fire to tyres and blocked streets in Porto Alegre and S\u00e3o Paulo. Lula leads early polls for October\u2019s presidential election, but the latest court decision means that he could be barred from running. The former union leader says he is innocent and the process is politically motivated to stop him from standing for an election. His supporters have called it an attack on democracy. Brazilians were glued to coverage of the case, with news sites and television broadcasting live from the courtroom. Troops and police sealed off the court building in central Porto Alegre, but tens of thousands of Lula\u2019s supporters \u2013 who had travelled from all over Brazil \u2013 gathered in a nearby avenue before a line of impassive riot police. Marilia Vieira, 48, a teacher from Bras\u00edlia, had spent 36 hours on a bus to get there. \u201cThe struggle will continue. And it will get more serious,\u201d she said. Lula\u2019s lawyers Cristiano Martins and Valeska Martins attacked the verdict and pledged to refer a complaint to the United Nations human rights committee. \u201cThe whole process from the very beginning has been a legal farce masquerading as justice,\u201d they said in a statement. Lula served two mandates from 2003-2010, then helped his Workers\u2019 party successor Dilma Rousseff win two more, before she was impeached for breaking budget rules in 2016 in a controversial process she denounced as a \u201ccoup\u201d. She joined leftists and jurists across the world in attacking the legal proceedings against Lula. Even Diego Maradona posted a selfie on Facebook holding a Brazil team shirt with \u201cLULA and 18\u201d, captioned: \u201cDear Lula, Diego is with you.\u201d The verdict confirmed a sentence handed to Lula in July by S\u00e9rgio Moro \u2013 a campaigning judge known for tough sentencing in corruption cases and increased jail time. Lula was found guilty of receiving a seaside duplex apartment worth about \u00a3540,000 ($755,000) from a construction company called OAS. Prosecutors said the gift was part of a multibillion-dollar bribe scheme controlled by the former president at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Lula\u2019s lawyers argued that he never owned the apartment and said they would appeal against the decision. Jo\u00e3o Gebran Neto, the judge leading the verdict, placed the apartment into the wider context of the graft network, which cost Petrobras billions of dollars. \u201cThe defendant in truth was the guarantor of the bigger scheme, for which he acted behind the scenes, which aimed in a surreptitious way to increase the financing of parties,\u201d he said. The decision means Lula is legally ineligible to stand under a \u201cclean slate\u201d law, said Silvana Batini, a professor of electoral law at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. But Lula had plenty of appeal options, she said. His party says he will register his candidacy on 15 August, and a final decision by electoral courts is unlikely before 17 September. \u201cThere are legal formalities that will let President Lula start the electoral process even though he has been convicted,\u201d Batini said. Running second to Lula in polls is Jair Bolsonaro, a far rightwing lawmaker and former army captain. But if Lula is definitively removed from contention, the race is left wide open, said Geraldo Tadeu, an adjunct professor of political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cFrom the electoral point of view, the game goes back to zero,\u201d he said. Many in Porto Alegre said they thought Lula was guilty of involvement in graft that benefited his party, even if the specific case being judged was weak. \u201cHe had to know,\u201d said Gerson Praxedes, 67, an accounting clerk. Others expressed concern over the increasingly bitter polarisation of Brazilian politics. \u201cWe see extremes of left and right,\u201d said Tanice Korman, 29, who works for the state government\u2019s environmental protection agency. \u201cWe don\u2019t have politicians who represent the population.\u201d Late on Wednesday, Lula addressed a crowd of thousands of supporters in S\u00e3o Paulo, saying that his conviction had been engineered by upper-class Brazilians who could not tolerate the gains poorer Brazilians had made under his party\u2019s rule. In a fiery speech, Lula vowed to fight on. \u201cWhile this heart still beats, and while these eyes still see and while this brain still thinks, the struggle is not over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country will prove that the poor people were never the problem. The poor people are the solution.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
