The Premier League champions\u2019 new head coach, Antonio Conte, spoke to both players last Wednesday as part of a round of talks with individuals from the first-team squad to outline expectations when he takes over at Stamford Bridge after leading Italy at Euro 2016. He is demanding evidence of complete commitment from the playing staff as he gauges the level of overhaul required this summer, with Chelsea aware that both goalkeepers have been unsettled at times over this campaign. Courtois has made no secret of his desire to return at some stage to La Liga, where he enjoyed three fruitful years on loan at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Real Madrid are expected to rekindle their long-standing interest in Manchester United\u2019s David de Gea when the transfer window reopens but, if that move stalls again, there is the possibility they could turn back to the Belgian, for whom they were dismissively quoted around \u20ac100m a year ago. Although the 23-year-old is not agitating for a move, he suggested while on international duty last month that his long-term future at Chelsea could be in some doubt, despite being contracted to 2019, and would be open to a switch to the Bernab\u00e9u in the event an offer is lodged that the London club would deem acceptable. Conte would prefer to retain his services, with other areas of the team in more urgent need of work and, should that hefty valuation remain, there seems little chance of a move being pushed through. Regardless, Begovic\u2019s stay may end up proving short-lived. The Bosnian, who joined from Stoke City last summer as a replacement for Petr Cech, has grown frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities and will not have been placated by his selection at Swansea City on Saturday given Courtois is expected to be restored to the starting lineup for the weekend visit of Manchester City. The 28-year-old, who also has three years to run on his deal, performed capably while Courtois was out with a knee meniscus problem in the autumn but was denied opportunities he had been promised in the cup competitions after Christmas with Guus Hiddink keen to give the Belgian game-time. The match at the Liberty Stadium was only his second start under the interim manager, with Begovic, whose professionalism has drawn praise from Hiddink, expected to push for a move in the summer regardless of whether Courtois remains at the club. The first addition to Conte\u2019s ranks is likely to be Roma\u2019s Belgium international midfielder Radja Nainggolan, with talks continuing in an attempt to reach a compromise over a fee. The Italian club hope to raise as much as \u20ac35m (\u00a328m) through his sale. The Chelsea captain, John Terry, who expects to depart under freedom of contract in the summer, is undergoing platelet rich plasma therapy in an attempt to cure an achilles complaint and return to the first team. The club do not expect him to be available for at least another fortnight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
