Vulnerable patients, mainly teenagers and young adults, are being taken hundreds of miles from their homes in order to receive residential care in Glasgow and near Edinburgh. Mental health experts voiced deep concern about the trend and said it could damage patients\u2019 chances of recovery, increase their sense of isolation through the separation from their families and even increase their risk of dying. Doctors, eating disorders charities and patients have told the Guardian that the quality of care received by patients, some of whom are at risk of dying, is being compromised by the NHS in England having far too few beds to cope with the growing number of cases of anorexia, bulimia and other forms of psychiatric illness linked to eating habits. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a rise in calls from people saying their children have been sent far away, miles away, to be looked after because there are either no services nearby or they are full\u201d, said Jane Smith, chief executive of Anorexia and Bulimia Care. \u201cThis is a life-threatening situation for young people. People are in inpatient care because they are at risk of dying. They are in a very fragile, risky state.\u201d Rebecca Doidge, 20, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, spent six months in the Priory private hospital in Glasgow earlier this year because she was desperate for treatment and could not find anywhere else. The distance had negative side-effects, she said. Despite being well looked after there, \u201cbeing sent so far away does compromise care\u201d, she said. \u201cThe outcomes are going to be better if you can stay near home. It\u2019s really hard to integrate back home or go to another environment when discharged if you are in a different country. It makes communication between those treating you in hospital and those at home difficult.\u201d During her stay in the Priory, which has 25-30 beds, \u201cabout seven of the people there were from Hertfordshire,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number of English people there massively outnumbered Scots.\u201d Anup Vyas\u2019s stepdaughter has been receiving treatment for a rare eating disorder in Huntercombe private hospital in Livingston, near Edinburgh, since February. After previous stints in units in Watford, London and Colchester in Essex, the 17-year-old\u2019s condition is so serious that \u201cnow she is basically being kept alive in Scotland\u201d, said Vyas. \u201cNHS England acknowledge that her being so far away is not ideal. Her brothers haven\u2019t visited her since June and no friends have gone up. Most people in the unit are from England, especially the north of England \u2013 places like York and Manchester.\u201d The family\u2019s home is in Hemel Hempstead, 350 miles from Livingston. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, criticised the practice as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. He recently said NHS children and adolescent mental health services were the NHS\u2019s worst area of care. \u201cIt is clearly unacceptable for people to be sent hundreds of miles away for care at a time when they need the support of friends and family the most\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why in April we committed to a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate out-of-area placements by 2020-21.\u201d Ministers had also earmarked \u00a3150m for enhanced services in community settings to help ensure that mental health problems in young people were tackled before their health worsens, he said. NHS England, despite its professed commitment to openness, refused to say how many patients from England were receiving treatment for eating disorders in Scotland. Expanding the supply of specialist beds to treat people with those conditions would take time, it said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely distressing for parents to have a child who is so unwell that they require inpatient care, and it\u2019s even worse when they can\u2019t easily visit their child because of long travel distances\u201d, said Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds. \u201cFor many young people the distance from family and friends is one of their biggest fears when they are hospitalised. Being separated from loved ones doesn\u2019t help with recovery and makes the stress of hospitalisation worse.\u201d Dr Jon Goldin, a consultant psychiatrist in London specialising in children and adolescents, said he had heard of patients being moved long distances. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern. Patients should be treated nearby and should be in contact with family. They need support and it\u2019s much harder to get that when families have to travel long distances. \u201cPart of their recovery may involve therapy with their family, especially for children aged 14 and under.\u201d, said Goldin, who is also a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists. More young people were developing eating disorders, he said. Genetic factors, personality factors and socio-cultural factors, such as images in the media of models \u201cwhich glamorise thinness\u201d are among the many reasons for the trend, Goldin said. A spokeswoman for the Priory hospital in Glasgow said it took patients from all over the UK. \u201cThe Priory hospital in Glasgow has a reputation for providing some of the highest standards of mental healthcare in the country, and has been given a \u2018very good\u2019 rating by our regulator, Healthcare Improvement Scotland, for staffing, management, information to patients, and the environment it offers those we care for. As such, we support patients from across the UK and overseas.\u201d A spokeswoman for NHS England said: \u201cThe NHS recently laid out very clear plans to expand staff and services for specialist eating disorders and other mental health problems, in order to tackle and eliminate distant out-of-area placements. Transformation won\u2019t happen overnight but work is under way to improve services for everyone and to make sure care is available at home or as close to home as possible when a patient needs more intensive therapy. \u201cTo help achieve this, the government has allocated a cumulative \u00a31.4bn to children and young people\u2019s mental health services over the next five years, and the new waiting time for eating disorder patients will ensure patients get better care more quickly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
