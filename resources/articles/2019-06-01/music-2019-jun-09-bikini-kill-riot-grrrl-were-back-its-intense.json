It's intense'", "bodyText": "Bikini Kill never intended to reunite. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that crossed my mind as a possibility or anything that I would want to do,\u201d says drummer Tobi Vail. \u201cGoing back in time doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2017, two decades after they\u2019d parted ways, that the pioneering riot grrrl band witnessed a model for doing it. They\u2019d been asked to play a song at a New York event in honour of the Raincoats, prompted by a book about the London-based feminist punk group\u2019s self-titled 1979 album. In that room, Vail witnessed a group often erased from the punk canon writing their own history. \u201cThey were telling their story on their own terms,\u201d recalls Vail. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in seizing history. To me, that\u2019s what being a band allows you to access. If we see historicisation as an institutional force, let\u2019s be inclusive: let women\u2019s voices in.\u201d After that night, Bikini Kill watched as fans called their brief performance a \u201creunion\u201d. It \u201cfelt right\u201d, says Vail, so they decided to do more shows. Vail is calling from LA, singer Kathleen Hanna\u2019s adopted home town, where the group have been rehearsing prior to the first leg of their tour in the US. She is firm that this it isn\u2019t just a nostalgia trip. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like an irrelevant, punk oldies thing.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s depressing or galvanising that a mission begun three decades ago still feels so relevant. In the wilds of early 90s Olympia, in America\u2019s Pacific Northwest, Bikini Kill\u2019s \u201crevolution girl style now\u201d aimed to radicalise girls and women to take direct action against sexism. The riot grrrl movement, founded by a coterie of like-minded bands and zine-makers nationwide, was about reclaiming a girlhood spoiled by misogyny. Bikini Kill tackled rape culture, female solidarity and the pursuit of pleasure in Hanna\u2019s confrontational sing-song vocals, backed by abrasive, lo-fi playing. At gigs, they famously brought \u201cgirls to the front\u201d to provide a sanctuary from the aggression of male-dominated punk shows. Life in the band was tough. While celebrated by peers such as Kurt Cobain (Hanna wrote \u201cKurt smells like Teen Spirit\u201d on his bedroom wall, inspiring Nirvana\u2019s biggest hit), they were often abused at shows, with some men turning up specifically to cause trouble. Other feminist punks decried Hanna after the media crowned her the leader of a supposedly non-hierarchical scene. The male-dominated music press frequently mocked the band (\u201cMoronic nag-unto-vomit tantrums over stock school-of-Sabbath riffage,\u201d wrote Rolling Stone of their self-titled 1993 EP) or seemed intentionally to misinterpret them: Hanna was repeatedly and wrongly portrayed as a survivor of incestuous abuse. \u201cIt was extremely sexist and condescending,\u201d says Vail of the coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting now, so imagine processing that at the time. People can\u2019t even hear what you\u2019re saying [as a band] because it\u2019s filtered through these institutions.\u201d The riot grrrl movement encouraged boycotting the media. On the rare occasion that Bikini Kill did speak to the press, it wasn\u2019t to promote their work but, says Vail, \u201cto encourage girls everywhere to start their own bands\u201d. Their success can\u2019t be overstated: it\u2019s impossible to imagine today\u2019s landscape without riot grrrl. After releasing three albums, Bikini Kill played their last show in Tokyo in 1997. \u201cThere were interpersonal conflicts,\u201d says Vail. \u201cWe\u2019d done everything we wanted to. It just fizzled out.\u201d Seven years is no mean feat for a young band under such pressure. Vail agrees. \u201cGetting to the end of your 20s, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018What am I going to do next?\u2019\u201d She feels warmly towards their younger selves. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a band it becomes like a relationship or a family structure, so you all get into your roles and that can become somewhat dysfunctional. We have different skill sets and it\u2019s a healthier lifestyle now \u2013 not like we were always nihilistic and self-destructive, but when you get older you figure out how to live and it\u2019s not such a struggle.\u201d Still, Vail is frustrated that women are still fighting for what riot grrrls wanted in the 90s. \u201cThese same issues still exist,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a woman in public is very intense, whether it\u2019s in the public eye or just walking down the street at night by yourself.\u201d In some respects, Bikini Kill\u2019s once-underground brand of feminism has gone mainstream: the #MeToo movement echoes conversations that riot grrrl opened up. \u201cObviously we didn\u2019t transform society,\u201d Vail says. Yet feminism has, in some respects, also been defanged. \u201cWhenever feminism intersects with the mainstream, you have to be a little suspicious about whose voices are not being heard,\u201d says Vail. She admits the same was true of riot grrrl, a very white, middle-class scene. \u201cI remember being like, \u2018Well, anyone can be in a band\u2019, but the truth is not everyone has access to information and resources and leisure time, and those privileges get reproduced over and over again.\u201d Their legacy \u2013 plus nostalgia \u2013 means that Bikini Kill are now bigger than in their heyday. The venues are larger, the tickets more expensive, the cultural cachet stronger. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different reality,\u201d Vail says of what the band can mean today. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we want to be a part of this conversation about what feminism is in this moment..\u201d They want to use music \u201cas a tool for enacting feminist mythology or helping to create a language\u201d. More specifically, Vail wants to replicate what the Raincoats did in New York, meaning more women find the band and understand their history, especially those who didn\u2019t hear them the first time around. They haven\u2019t decided whether Bikini Kill will make new music. Vail says they are being cautious and making decisions based on what feels appropriate personally and politically. But she knows their old songs have new power in today\u2019s modern climate \u2013 the desire to question socialisation in Feels Blind, or that riotous call for female togetherness in cult hit Rebel Girl. Playing them in the rehearsal space has been \u201cphysically emotional\u201d, she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing drums and Kathleen\u2019s singing and we\u2019re back in that place again. It\u2019s intense. It\u2019s not that since the early 90s the songs have ceased to have meaning, but everything she\u2019s saying feels like it\u2019s right now.\u201d \u2022 Bikini Kill play the O2 Academy Brixton, London, 10-11 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
