New Zealand have Mark Richardson, who is more like slow-drying cement. Yesterday, as his more talented top-order colleagues came and went, he did what he does best: laying the foundations, brick by torturous brick. Richardson compiled 93 off 266 balls in 378 minutes to help New Zealand reach 284 for five by the end of the first day. He summed up his efforts with typical self-effacement. \"Pretty dour, miserable, poking and prodding really,\" he said with a smile. In a world of Identikit sportsmen, he is a self-made man who can laugh at his limitations. \"I'm not a gifted player in terms of my ability to play shots,\" he said. \"And it has been a little bit of a goal of mine to speed up my scoring. But I'm lucky I play in a team that allows me to play my defence-oriented game.\" That role was clear from the start. He managed 32 in the morning session, 24 between lunch and tea and a positively whippet-like 37 in the 32 overs before he was given out lbw by Darrell Hair, who failed to spot a big inside-edge. \"I would have preferred to have hit the ball in the middle of the bat,\" Richardson said. Like the man himself, his route to opening the batting for New Zealand has been an object lesson in unorthodoxy. He started life as a left-arm spinner and No11 before a bout of the yips in the mid-1990s forced him to reinvent himself as a batsman. Slowly but surely he pared down the shots until only a few remained. \"I might have crunched my game down too much but that's my role and I have to be happy with that. Maybe at times I wish I was [Adam] Gilchrist.\" Seasoned Richardson watchers - and there are believed to be some who have stayed awake long enough to make a judgment - say he has based his new career on three scoring shots: the straight-drive, the cut and the nudge to leg. Yesterday he more or less shelved the lot, preferring to make use of the lesser spotted cover drive and, needless to say, the leave-alone, which is Richardson's staple. \"It's probably a credit to the way the England guys bowled that I had to look through that area to score runs - an area I'm not comfortable with. They all bowled with enough gas and I'm sure when you face England over the next five or 10 years, those will be the names that you'll be preparing for.\" England, meanwhile, had been prepared for Richardson. \"He played really well,\" said Simon Jones, who removed the New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and then Scott Styris for a duck. \"He played just how we thought he would - really patient - and hung around all day. It can be frustrating at times. He plays and misses a couple of times and then he blocks the next ball. He doesn't seem to lose his patience. It's good experience to bowl at him. We just tried not to do anything different, which is the key on a wicket like this.\" Both sides, naturally, were claiming the high ground at the close. But Richardson was left to reflect on a missed opportunity. \"They don't put 90s up on the board in the changing-room,\" he said glumly. \"I put a lot of work into my game after a disappointing series against South Africa. But I know when I wake up that I'll have been so close to a hundred here, and I know I'll be disappointed. When you're going to face 300 balls to get a hundred, one of them's likely to get you out, isn't it?\" No one in the ground would have begrudged him a hundred."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
