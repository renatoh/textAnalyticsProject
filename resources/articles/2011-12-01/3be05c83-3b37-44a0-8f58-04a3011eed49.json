It's Ron Paul, the latest, and perhaps last, flavor of the month in the Republican nominating contest. A large section of the GOP base continues to view the prospect of voting for Mitt Romney with considerable distaste, and now the long-term Texas congressman and hero to libertarians is at the head of the pack in the vital first voting state of Iowa. What? Supporters of Paul, long derided as a hopeless outsider by much of the Republican party, often complain he is unfairly ignored. However, be careful what you wish for. Paul's emergence as a contender has seen him come under withering fire for his views on the economy and foreign policy, while the media has delved into a murky past of racist newsletters published in his name. This ad, called \"Machine\", is Paul's response to the pressure. It hits back at his opponents (notably Romney and Newt Gingrich) while portraying Paul as the principled outsider to a corrupt system. Not surprisingly, it ignores those newsletters. When? Now. The ad was released on Wednesday and is airing on TV in Iowa and New Hampshire. We are in the endgame. There is no point pussyfooting around with web ads that you hope go viral, and no point playing nice with your rivals. It's showtime. If you have money left in your war chest, you spend it. If your rivals are hitting at you (and they are trying to give Paul one hell of a pasting), you punch back. Why? Two theories explain the attraction of Paul. His supporters would say that his surge in popularity is due to his consistent conservatism and his brave condemnation of a system that has failed America and the real aims of the constitution. Other people say he is the last untried option of a group of Romney-hating conservatives who have cycled through a parade of bizarre and/or incompetent candidates \u2013 Gingrich, Donald Trump, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Gingrich (again) \u2013 and is now throwing it's final dice with Paul. That argument paints Paul as a kind of last-choice date for the prom after all other possible dates got grounded for bad behaviour. But either way, this is Paul's moment \u2013 and he needs to seize it. A sizeable section of the Republican party is up for grabs and disillusioned with the idea of Romney as the 2012 nominee. Paul is now in a position to win their support (at least for Iowa) and this ad is spearheading that effort. How? The ad starts in a punchy and powerful style, using a washed-out palate and fast editing in order to get its message across in just 30 seconds. That message is simple: America is in trouble, every other candidate is part of the problem but Ron Paul is the solution. It starts off correctly identifying the main issue of the 2012 election: the economy. \"The Washington machine is strangling the economy,\" says the gravelly-voiced narrator, blaming politicians of all stripes for the nation's fiscal woes. Of course, it neglects to mention the rather large role played in the Great Recession by unfettered capitalism and rapacious bankers, but we would not expect that from the government-hating Paul. Then it swiftly labels Gingrich a \"hypocrite\" and Romney a \"flip-flopper\", efficiently labelling his two main opponents with the most powerful insults used against them. Astonishingly, we are still only 13 seconds into the ad. This is hyper-efficient stuff. Now it's on to the positive side of things. \"One man stands alone,\" the voiceover intones, before hailing Paul's plan to slash a staggering $1tn out of the federal budget in his first year (something sure to put tens of thousands of people out of work just as the threat of another global economic crisis looms). Then it goes into full messiah mode (ironically sounding a little like a Barack Obama ad circa 2008). \"Guided by faith and principle, Ron Paul: the one we've been looking for,\" the ad concludes. It is actually a good ad. Professional, efficient and simple. It attacks its rivals, addresses the main voter concern, suggests some policies and praises the candidate. But is that enough? In the final days Paul is going to have to endure a firestorm of attacks and hostile media coverage. The racist newsletters alone might be enough to burst the Paul brand of the anti-Romney bubble. This ad does not feel like enough to head off that tidal wave. Expect more to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
