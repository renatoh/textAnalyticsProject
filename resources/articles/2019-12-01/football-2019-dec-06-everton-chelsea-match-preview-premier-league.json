For all the goodwill that will come Ferguson\u2019s way, his promotion is not a cause for celebration but a symbol of Everton\u2019s malfunction under the erratic ownership of Farhad Moshiri. A club that has spent over \u00a3450m on players since Moshiri\u2019s arrival finds itself in the bottom three and led by a sixth different coach in under four years. Chelsea will relish the opportunity.
