Known as the Colombia Three, Niall Connolly, Martin McCauley and James Monaghan vanished from Bogota in December after an appeal court reversed their acquittal of training Farc guerillas in urban warfare. It had been thought they were in Cuba. RTE last night broadcast an extraordinary interview with Mr Monaghan, a former senior IRA member. He said: \"I'm back and there's nothing to be on the run about.\" He had \"no regrets.\" Mr Monaghan would not say how the men returned to Ireland. \"We returned as soon as we were able to return ... A lot of people in a lot of countries had to help us. I can't endanger those people .\" He said no deal was done with the Irish or British governments and denied he was avoiding Irish police.\"I am not on the run.\" He said he hoped he would be \"left in peace\". Mr Monaghan insisted they visited Colombia to learn about the peace process. Asked about their conviction for travelling on false passports, he said: \"It wouldn't have been possible to go in our own names.\" Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, demanded that the men should be arrested. \"Bertie Ahern would do well to remember the words of President Bush when he said: 'Those who harbour terrorists are terrorists'.\" The return threw the Irish government into confusion as the Colombia Three and Sinn F\u00e9in denied any deal had been done after last week's IRA statement that its armed struggle was over. The Irish department of justice said it was aware of reports that the men were in Ireland. A spokesman said no extradition treaty existed with Colombia, but any request would be considered. The Northern Ireland Office said if the men crossed the border they would face extradition. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams said: \"I would hope that they can now get on with their lives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
