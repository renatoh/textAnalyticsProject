Although the 25-year-old striker is valued at around \u00a315m, R\u00e9my is entering the final year of his contract at Marseille and Newcastle believe there is scope for negotiation. They could face competition from Arsenal and Tottenham for a forward who scored 20 goals in 42 appearances last season. Although reports in Russia have claimed that Rubin Kazan are poised to trigger Demba Ba's \u00a37m release clause before its expiry on 31 July, Newcastle say there has been no contact with the Russian club. Earlier this summer Ba attracted interest from Turkey's Galatasaray but the striker has a knee condition which could ensure he remains on Tyneside. Meanwhile Alan Pardew, Newcastle's manager, has reached an impasse in his attempts to prise the France right-back Mathieu Debuchy away from Lille, the Brazilian central defender Douglas from FC Twente and Andy Carroll from Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
