Yet measles, malnutrition and diarrhoea remain tediously commonplace causes of death in all too many parts of it in the first years of the twenty-first century. At least 300,000 Afghan children died of these last winter. UNICEF reported last week that 100,000 more children will die in Afghanistan during this winter if aid - both food and medical - does not reach them in sufficient quantities. And that cannot happen if bombing of the country continues. The equation might have tried even utilitarians Jeremy Bentham or John Stuart Mill. One hundred thousand more deaths if bombing goes on. A greater good squandered if it ceases. Regardless of the uncertainty of statistical measures of mortality, we confront a situation where targeted bombing of Afghanistan will, for the moment, be sustained. That is controversial, as Jason Burke demonstrates on these pages. However, both the American and British governments are now committed to it, and France, Germany and New Zealand are about to demonstrate their backing for the international alliance against terrorism by sending their troops too. It is ghastly to observe any part of the world at war, and disturbing that the military strategy behind this conflict has not been fully explained. But if there is a credible military plan as ground forces enter Afghanistan this weekend, with the seizure of Osama bin Laden as a key objective, then we must hope fervently that those forces achieve their objectives swiftly. Afghans have already been starving for three years. However, without control and rebuilding of the roads infrastructure no aid will reach many of the desperately hungry this winter in any case. That control will not be yielded while the Taliban are in power. Moreover, the Taliban are already seizing much of the food aid that enters Afghanistan to feed their own troops, and are extorting bribes as a condition for passing on the remainder to others. The only truly humanitarian outcome for Afghanistan's starving now requires the downfall of the Taliban government. Sixty years ago, the far-sighted spent much of the Second World War planning a better world intended to follow. Those responsible for prosecuting the war against terrorism must determine how aid agencies, governments and charities will work alongside military strategists to bring relief to the Afghan people as soon as is practicably possible. We might not be able to save 300,000, or 200,000, or even 100,000 children this winter. But a rebuilt Afghanistan, enabled to sustain its own production and distribution of adequate food supplies, will save hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lives every year from now on. That is a prize every bit as valuable as the necessary capture of Osama bin Laden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
