Yesterday they shrugged off the recent loss of their captain Mike Hussey - average 89 this season - to the Australian one-day squad and their top three wickets to a seaming pitch on a truncated Wednesday. Regrouping around the acting captain Dale Benkenstein, their middle order clocked up three batting points in entertaining fashion. And there are few finer entertainers on the circuit than their 22-year-old wicket-keeper Phil Mustard, now preferred to the more sophisticated gloveman Andy Pratt because of his explosive batting. He has opened two championship innings this season with a six, and yesterday he clocked a career-best 80 in even time. This was the third occasion in a month that he cranked up his best score, after 77 at Old Trafford and 78 against Yorkshire. A substantial innings must soon follow these promising cameos. Mustard moved beyond his half-century in a Jason Brown over costing 16 runs. There was an effortless straight six, a four paddled fine and an elegant sweep, plus singles for himself and his partner Ashley Noffke. Noffke, the Australian fast bowler pitched in this match against his Queensland chum Martin Love, a former Durham player himself, was the junior partner to Mustard in a seventh-wicket stand of 135. It ended when Mustard prodded with uncharacteristic uncertainty at Damien Wright, edging to slip. Earlier Benkenstein had continued Wednesday evening's fruitful alliance with Gareth Breese and moved to 50 hooking Wright for four. Breese also went past the half-century mark with a boundary before missing a sweep at Brown, and the Durham revival faded away at tea. The stylish Love then organised a spirited Northants response in what may now be a battle for bonus points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
