Dress code: Washboards. What happened: So just who does this Jake Bugg kid think he is? Headlining over the Manic Street Preachers and Pixies, wandering on stage to an intro tape of classic bluesmen and playing skiffle songs like a millennial Lonnie Donegan? Well, actually, he\u2019s something of a Glastonbury phenomenon \u2013 his 2pm Pyramid stage slot last year drew a headliner-sized crowd. Hence, he\u2019s been rushed to the top of the Other stage way too soon. If Seen It All, his world-weary tale of knife crime, drugs and arrests, prematurely suggested Bugg was experienced beyond his years, tonight he seems to be desperately trying to grow up in public. Thrilling juvenilia such as Trouble Town and Lightning Bolt sound as sparky as ever, but as his band and bookings expand he\u2019s slipping further towards classic retro cliches \u2013 awful boogie-woogie set-fillers and bluegrass stomps that, at times, make it look as though a random Avalon Caf\u00e9 act has invaded the headline slot. Yet he\u2019s building a solid catalogue of mini-epics such as A Song About Love and Simple Pleasures that, in a few album\u2019s time, might warrant the slot he\u2019s playing right now. High point: Broken, a captivating solo song that silences a field full of drunk chatterers, proves Bugg\u2019s potential as a superstar balladeer and probably mends a fair few mud-shattered relationships. Low point: A truly appalling cover of Little Richard\u2019s Rip It Up. In a tweet: Give him three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
