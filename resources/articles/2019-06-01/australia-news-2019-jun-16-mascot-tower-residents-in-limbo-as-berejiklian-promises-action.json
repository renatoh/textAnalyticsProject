Residents of Sydney\u2019s Mascot Towers apartments complex have been left in limbo as engineers try to put an end to the cracking, which forced an evacuation on Friday. Berejiklian said on Sunday the government wants to \u201cget to the root cause\u201d and find out what has occurred. \u201cThere was some speculation it could have been from things that happened in the near vicinity but we need to find out the cause before we know how to act,\u201d she said. Asked if the NSW government would help displaced residents in the meantime, the premier said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the bottom of what happened.\u201d All 122 units and all but two ground-level shops of the decade-old Mascot Towers in Sydney\u2019s inner south were empty on Saturday and no advice has been given on when residents and businesses would be able to permanently return. On Sunday, owners and occupiers were told engineers had determined three access zones would be put in place for the next five to seven days. About half of all units would be partly accessible from Monday, so that residents, escorted by the building manager, could return for a short period of time to collect personal items. \u201cThereafter the engineer will advise if further monitoring or alternate and corrective action is required,\u201d an update said. Concerns had emerged about cracks in the building\u2019s primary support structure and facade masonry, prompting moves to install temporary structural support. Some residents were given about an hour to pack their things and evacuate. Labor MP for Heffron, Ron Hoenig, said he had been told there was no chance the evacuated complex would collapse. He also suggested residents might be out of the property for about a week. Initial investigations are expected to focus on a new apartment block that was recently built next door. \u201cIt\u2019s suspicious that the new building is not even occupied and the building that\u2019s been up for 12 years all of a sudden has substantial cracks,\u201d Hoenig said. Authorities said on Saturday that there had been \u201cidentifiable movements in the basement area\u201d, but no signs of any \u201cimmediate structural failures\u201d. The airport rail line and Mascot train station, which sits underneath the complex, had not been impacted. Renters have been informed their temporary accommodation will not be covered by insurance while owners\u2019 alternate housing may also not be covered. A temporary shelter is in place at the Sydney town hall. Residents and owners will receive a daily update email and have been told to contact the state\u2019s consumer watchdog if the are facing financial hardship. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit annoying to not really know what is going on and move at short notice but we\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d Mascot Towers tenant Jade told reporters on Saturday. Another tenant, who is now living nearby with a friend, said he was effectively homeless after being given 75 minutes to leave on Friday night. \u201cThe general thing going through my mind was \u2018what can I leave here and just go buy\u2019,\u201d tenant Cameron told AAP on Saturday. Engineers had been surveying the damage over weeks, but noticed a widening in the cracks on Thursday and Friday. The evacuation comes months after the Opal Tower debacle and with Sydney having experienced a decade-long apartments boom. In December, hundreds of residents had to be evacuated from the Opal Tower in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park after a crack developed in a load-bearing concrete panel and the building shifted 2mm \u2013 causing plaster to crack and doors to stick in their frames. In February, an independent report found that multiple design and construction faults had led to damage at the Opal Tower. Engineers Australia said the situation was further evidence changes were needed in the building and construction sector. \u201cThe evacuation of Opal Tower was a major wake-up call for NSW to get serious about reform,\u201d spokesman Jonathan Russell said in a statement. \u201cIt is time to finally implement the changes agreed by Council of Australian Governments in response to its inquiry into regulation of the sector.\u201d In response to the Opal tower crisis, the NSW government announced plans to tighten building regulations and inspections. The premier said strata building policy was \u201calways a work in progress\u201d and \u201cof course\u201d more needs to be done. \u201cWe need to ensure their rights are protected, whether they\u2019re owners or whether they\u2019re tenants,\u201d she said. Berejiklian said she anticipated a new NSW Building Commissioner would be named in the \u201cvery near future\u201d. Guardian Australia has contacted Mascot Towers for comment.
