He won by 18.2sec from Kimi Raikkonen's McLaren, leaving the 23-year old Finn with a mountain to climb in the Japanese grand prix at Suzuka in a fortnight's time. If he is to prevent Schumacher taking the title, Raikkonen has to win the final race of the season with the Ferrari driver failing to score if he is to take the championship by a point. The race also saw the end of Juan Pablo Montoya's title assault, the Colombian finishing a troubled sixth in his Williams after an incident-packed race which saw him incur a drive-through penalty after pushing Rubens Barrichello's Ferrari off the circuit as they jostled for position in the early stages. Williams also lost their lead in the constructors' championship, dropping three points behind Ferrari, who now have 147 points. Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished third in his Sauber, with Jarno Trulli's Renault fourth and the other Sauber driven by Nick Heidfeld fifth ahead of Montoya. The appearance of ominous dark clouds and a smattering of rain in the immediate run-up to the start raised the tension, but the track surface was dry as Raikkonen led the pack off around their formation lap prior to taking their positions on the final grid. As the starting lights went out, Raikkonen made a perfect getaway and the entire field managed to negotiate the tricky first right hander without any bumping or wheel rubbing. The Finn completed the opening lap 1.6sec ahead of Olivier Panis's Toyota, Ralf Schumacher's Williams and Michael Schumacher's Ferrari, which had made a strong getaway from seventh place on the third row of the grid. Raikkonen cantered away from the pack in the early stages, but Montoya was almost immediately embroiled in controversy. The Colombian had made a slow start, which saw him come round in seventh place at the end of the opening lap. Pushing hard to stay in contention, he ran down the outside of Rubens Barrichello's sixth-placed Ferrari as they braked for the right-hander after the pits, then tried to squeeze ahead of the Brazilian as they went into the left hander immediately following. In an excessively ambitious manoevre, Montoya forced his Williams up the kerb on the inside and made firm contact with Barrichello, spinning him into the gravel trap and out of the race. Montoya lost a couple more places, but was immediately reported to the stewards for a possible driving infringement. Eventually it was decided that Montoya was to blame and he was forced to serve a drive-through penalty which effectively wiped him out of contention. Qualifying had seen all of the title contenders take a strategic approach, striking a balance between being quick enough on the mile-long straight past the pits and having sufficient aerodynamic downforce to make the best of the twisting infield section. Raikkonen, who went into the race trailing Michael Schumacher by seven points, got his McLaren perfectly trimmed out to set a pole winning 1min 11.670sec, 0.124sec ahead of Barrichello, while Panis sprang a surprise by setting the third fastest time. As the race unfolded the biggest challenge for the teams was trying to keep one step ahead of the wildly changing weather conditions. A shower doused the circuit on lap seven as Montoya tore past both Michael Schumacher and Alonso to take fourth place. Going into lap 15 Montoya surged ahead of Coulthard to take fourth place and with Schumacher's Ferrari back in fifth, the Colombian was emerging as a very strong contender, had it not been for that drive-through penalty hanging over his head. On lap 18 the rain started and intensified dramatically two laps later. Raikkonen made his first pit stop on lap 19, followed by Schumacher and Jarno Trulli's Renault, from what were now first and second places next time around. Suddenly the track was soaked and the cars were slipping and sliding in all directions, team managers desperately attempting to reduce the impact of the dramatically changing conditions and trying to anticipate whether or not the surface would remain wet or start drying again. By lap 21 Mark Webber's Jaguar was leading but spun off next time around, as did Ralf Schumacher from second place, and with Michael Schumacher making another unscheduled tyre stop at the end of lap 21, Coulthard led briefly from Raikkonen. At this point the well-placed Jenson Button, profiting by the performance of the Bridgestone rain tyres, took over at the head of the pack in his BAR, leading from Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Sauber and Raikkonen, whose Michelin rubber was less well suited to the wet conditions. At the start of lap 38 Schumacher's Ferrari went ahead of Button to take the lead and the hapless British driver stopped three laps later when his engine expired spectacularly on the straight. From then on Schumacher cruised home to win, leaving Raikkonen to pass Frentzen but never allowing his rival to get within sight of his bullet-proof scarlet machine, which never missed a beat from start to finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
