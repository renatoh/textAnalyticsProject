And the prime minister replied: \u201cI\u2019m going to get Brexit done.\u201d Wow. I feel like I know how this fairytale ends. Guest vocals by the late great Kirsty MacColl. Yet even by his own standards of thermonuclear disingenuity, Johnson\u2019s turn on ITV news on Monday morning reached new depths. In a fish market in Grimsby, ITV News reporter Joe Pike asked Johnson about newspaper reports featuring Jack Williment-Barr, a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia, who was pictured being forced to sleep on a concrete floor in an overcrowded NHS hospital this weekend. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the photo,\u201d Johnson said. Look at it now, said Pike, who had it up on his phone. At which point Johnson simply took the reporter\u2019s phone and stuffed it in his pocket. What has happened to reality? What can you say? Other than: may all would-be statesmen disport themselves with the casual larceny of a guy who knows if you don\u2019t let the legal papers physically touch you, then they haven\u2019t been served on you. For my money, the inclusion of the auto-satirical words \u201cprime minister\u201d at the end of Pike\u2019s next sentence mark it out as a contender for quote of the campaign. Let\u2019s see them in action: \u201cYou refuse to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone, and put it in your pocket, prime minister.\u201d YOU\u2019VE ROBBED HIS PHONE LIVE ON AIR. Sorry \u2013 you\u2019ve robbed his phone live on air, prime minister. A pause. \u201cSorry,\u201d said the prime minister of the United Kingdom, eventually, fumbling around in his pocket for another man\u2019s phone and some more lies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone, but there you go,\u201d blustered Johnson. \u201cI was just \u2026\u201d But he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. How on earth could he have finished the sentence? He simply tailed off. Later, at a Q&amp;A in a Sunderland factory, Johnson appeared to float scrapping the BBC licence fee simply to distract from this story \u2013 a move that vaguely reminded me of Bill Clinton bombing the Sudanese aspirin factory to distract from his blowjob hearings. As Johnson put it: \u201cI\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof.\u201d Incorrect. You\u2019re under pressure because you nicked a phone live on telly. When she was through the looking glass, the White Queen famously told Alice that \u201csometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\u201d. No offence to Her Majesty, but this is an incredibly low score if you\u2019ve been listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s early morning media round. That said, the PM\u2019s breakfast interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC on Monday gave us a little insight into his process \u2013 kind of like an episode of Inside the Liar\u2019s Studio. The prime minister allowed lucky listeners a real-time chance to see how he turns in some of his more memorable mendacious performances. Take the other sort of lying \u2013 lying on the floor in front of bulldozers, which he\u2019d once promised to do if Heathrow went ahead with a third runway, but which now appears in direct opposition to government policy. Is he going to do it? wondered Ferrari, rhetorically. \u201cI would \u2026 have to find some way of honouring that promise,\u201d mused Johnson, like one of those pundits who promise to eat their shoe live on air if something doesn\u2019t happen, then are proved wrong, but eat a shoe made out of cake and imagine they\u2019re quits. Like this, but with his entire climate morality. \u201cIt might be technically difficult to achieve,\u201d Johnson continued, ostensibly talking about the bulldozers, but subconsciously surely weighing up the technical challenges of the lie. This would be a 4 \u00bd reverse ferret, in the pike position, with 2 \u00bd twists. Technically difficult to achieve \u2013 near-impossible to guarantee a perfect 10 from the Russian judge \u2013 yet somehow entirely doable for this most tireless of all competitors. Even when not actively advancing one of his own lies, Johnson has developed a new tic of lying that he doesn\u2019t understand his interviewer\u2019s questions. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by breaking a red wall,\u201d he lied to Ferrari about a term that has been bandied about by his Tory strategists the entire campaign. It was the same last week when people were asking him questions about the film of him taking the piss out of Donald Trump with some other Nato leaders. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he lied then. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d The prime minister remains a man whose deep personal philosophy can be summed up by the video for Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. His other stylistic trait has been linking two things that have precisely no bearing on the other. Asked by Ferrari about Jack Williment-Barr, Johnson appeared to suggest that the real illness is Britain\u2019s political constipation. Not having Brexit is \u201cblocking things\u201d, he explained. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got things motoring,\u201d he suggested, situations like a small child being treated on a floor would no longer occur, \u201cbut that can only happen when we\u2019ve got Brexit done.\u201d Hang on, what? Why? What in the name of logic, never mind empathy, are you talking about? We expect sociopathy, but at least lace it with basic coherence. Then again, we have reached the stage of the campaign where Johnson\u2019s words feel terminally unmoored from reality. Take his Grimsby visit, where he offered fishermen \u201cthe chance to recapture some of that spectacular marine wealth\u201d \u2013 a way of putting it that makes one of the country\u2019s most hardscrabble industries sound easily as rewarding as running a hedge fund. Follow Johnson, even if it goes against your instincts, and he will make you fishers of men. Which is to say that you\u2019ll be retraining as cold callers if you currently fish sustainably, then he ends up going for no-deal and you lose paper-free access to the single market. And that\u2019s if he hasn\u2019t had your phone off you, preventing you from even making the calls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
