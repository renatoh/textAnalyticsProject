As hosts of next year\u2019s tournament, England are keen to maximise their home advantage and want to establish the stadium as a place visiting teams fear to tread. England\u2019s captain accepts there is increasing pressure on the players with the World Cup looming but believes the supporters can make their task easier, as they did when England beat the All Blacks in this same fixture two years ago. \u201cThe year we beat them I remember Swing Low being sung so loudly we couldn\u2019t even hear the haka,\u201d recalled Robshaw, who is set to lead out England for the 28th time this weekend. \u201cIt was incredible. It got all the players going and got everyone ready. With the World Cup at Twickenham, I think it does make these matches more important. They all want to come here and play well. We want the opposite. We want it to be a fortress. We want the atmosphere to be similar to our last two home games, against Wales and Ireland, and the performance to be similar also. We\u2019re at home and we want to show the crowd we\u2019ve come a long way in the last year. From minute one I\u2019m sure Twickenham will get right behind us.\u201d It is also Robshaw\u2019s belief his team were unfortunate to lose all three Tests against the All Blacks in New Zealand in June. The touring side were hindered by availability issues and end-of-season fatigue and feel stronger this time. \u201cWe felt we were unlucky down there in the summer not to quite get what we wanted. We felt we got quite close to them in some ways and we think we excelled in certain areas ... we\u2019ve seen we can hurt them at certain stages. \u201cUnfortunately we were not able to produce an 80-minute performance. As Australia found out a couple of weeks ago, if you don\u2019t play for the full 80, this side are capable of winning from anywhere. That\u2019s a step we have to make. If we can do that, we are extremely confident in our abilities and in the players we have.\u201d Stuart Lancaster is set to confirm a starting XV containing only two backs who featured in England\u2019s final Test in New Zealand. Bath\u2019s uncapped Semesa Rokoduguni is poised for his first start on the right wing, with Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond in the centres, and Robshaw is promising a full throttle effort from his team. \u201cWe were a side that was very defence orientated. We we were very proud of that defence and probably won a lot of games because of it. Our attack has now caught up with that. \u201cWe can threaten with our attack and still have that dominant defence as well. Even though we haven\u2019t played together as a unit we feel we\u2019ve developed.\u201d Not giving New Zealand the chance to counterattack, however, will be equally crucial, according to Robshaw. \u201cThere is no magic formula,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the pressure of the situation, it\u2019s about who is able to take their chances and keep their composure. It\u2019s about being clinical. In international rugby you know you\u2019re going to get a couple of chances but, when everything is flying around, are we good enough to take our chances? \u201cAs an England squad, that\u2019s the next step we need to take if we really want to push ourselves up there. We need to be as clinical as these guys coming to town.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s recent defeat against South Africa and narrow win over Australia have also encouraged England to believe they can kick off this month\u2019s schedule successfully. \u201cAndy Farrell speaks well about it: New Zealand are the best attacking side but defensively there are opportunities out there,\u201d said Robshaw, 28. \u201cWe have to identify them and see if we can find that space. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand off these guys for a second. It\u2019s about us putting our game out there. There will be a lot of talk about next year and this is the last time we will play each other prior to that. There\u2019s no hiding place. You\u2019re not going into this game to come out second best, are you?\u201d England (v New Zealand, probable) M Brown (Harlequins), S Rokoduguni (Bath), B Barritt (Saracens), K Eastmond (Bath), J May (Gloucester); O Farrell (Saracens), D Care (Harlequins): J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Wilson (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton), T Wood (Northampton), C Robshaw (Harlequins), B Vunipola (Saracens).
