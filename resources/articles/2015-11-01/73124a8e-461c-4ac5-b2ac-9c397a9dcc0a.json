By the start of November he has made the position, for now, his own, Watford sit five points and six places above his parent club, and by way of a bonus the Dutchman set their latest victory in motion by stealing the ball from Andy Carroll to set up the first goal against West Ham. \u201cI would never have expected to be above Chelsea but they will come back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a good team. It is difficult to say if we can finish above them \u2013we are doing really well and we can\u2019t deny that, but we can\u2019t look too far ahead. We have to look game by game.\u201d Perhaps, for many members of this Watford side, this is more than a cliche. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores named an unchanged team and apparently believes that rotation is best confined to Odion Ighalo\u2019s twinkle-toed, defender-bewitching excursions around the penalty area which brought the striker another two goals, but the manager has done enough to prove that no one\u2019s position can be taken entirely for granted. Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl started the first nine games but has spent the last two on the bench; Valon Behrami started the first five but became both suspended and injured and now finds Ben Watson blocking his path; while the Greek international Jos\u00e9 Holebas, the favoured left-back in August, has not played a single minute since the defeat at Manchester City at the end of that month. \u201cI\u2019ve never played left-back constantly so I\u2019m not used to getting forward,\u201d Ak\u00e9 said. \u201cEvery week I\u2019m learning new things \u2013 the manager allows me to make mistakes but also sees that I am improving and getting better every time.\u201d His last two home games illustrate his point: troubled by H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn in Arsenal\u2019s 3-0 win, he was sufficiently comfortable against Victor Moses on Saturday that the on-loan Chelsea forward was taken off at half-time. That was where the trouble really started for West Ham. Already a goal down, they started the second half with a 15-minute demonstration of the art of haplessness, and should have been more than two behind by the time they pulled themselves together and the substitute Enner Valencia brought some of the dynamism that had been missing from their attack. West Ham\u2019s reputation for triumphant travelling, built by victories at Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Crystal Palace, looked ill-deserved throughout. Mark Noble said: \u201cObviously we were going to lose an away game, we knew that, but to lose in that manner is a little disappointing. We didn\u2019t quite tick today, for reasons I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to give Watford credit: the two boys up front played really well, they were a strong team and they deserved their three points. We\u2019re thoroughly disappointed but we\u2019ve got a strong group of players \u2013 we\u2019ve been on a fantastic run, but this is the time we\u2019ve got to stand up and be counted.\u201d Man of the match Ben Watson (Watford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
