She writes: I intended stopping by in London for three days. Three-and-a-half years later, I am still here and very confused about what to do with my savings. My intention was to travel across Europe, rather than make any great career moves, so I have not adopted any long-term financial plan. When I initially arrived in London, I did a bit of temporary secretarial work. However, in the past two years, I have found myself in a permanent position which pays \u00a341,000 with a car allowance. None of this was planned and I never thought of myself as a career person but I have fallen into a senior role. This has enabled me to save. I contribute \u00a3200 a month to two employee share plans (a stock purchase plan and an SAYE); I have \u00a33,000 in a Northern Rock cash Isa and I con tribute \u00a3700 a month to Barclays Open Plan, which now has \u00a39,000 in it. I think I will be ready to leave London in two years, although this city can be addictive, so I wouldn't rule out a longer stay. Before heading home, I want to go travelling for about five months. I will go backpacking so I won't need a substantial amount of money and I can save what I will want between now and leaving. This means I will not need to touch the money I have saved so far. I have quite a bit of money for someone of my age, considering that I didn't mean for it to accumulate. I am quite pleased but I just don't know what I should be doing with it. I have never filed a tax return - am I expected to? Is it more effective to keep the money in the UK or should I transfer some to Australia, where I will eventually return? I have read about the money people have made from buying property , but is that a good idea if I'm not going to be in the country in two years' time? The standard of living in Australia is substantially higher than here and I am contemplating buying a property in Oz, where your money can buy somewhere decent. I'm not sure if this is the best channel for my savings but I do not know where else to put it, given the state of stock markets. Action plan As you will not be staying in London and will definitely end up in Australia, you must keep your savings readily available because you will need cash to settle back and there is no point leaving any investments in the UK. Avoid anything based on the stock market because you would have to cash in it in two years' time, regardless of the state of the market. The UK and Australian tax rules are different and even tax-efficient UK investments are fully taxable in Australia. Alan Collett, managing director of the Go Matilda website warns: 'She needs to be aware of the Foreign Investment Fund rules.' Col lett, a UK accountant and permanent resident of Australia, set up the website to advise people moving to Australia on migration and money: 'If one returns to Australia and retains UK investments, there can be some peculiar and adverse tax consequences. If she keeps an Isa, endowment or personal pension and their value exceeds A$50,000, she can be taxed on the growth of the funds each year if they stay in the UK, even though they have tax advantages in the UK.' Neither should you start saving in Australia until you get back, even though you risk the Australian dollar being stronger against sterling than it is now. Steve Travis of specialist adviser Wilfred T Fry explains: 'If Madeleine starts investing in Australia while still living in the UK, she will pay a withholding tax, such as 10 per cent on bank accounts.' With pensions, though, you can really turn the difference to your advantage because you get UK tax relief on any pension contributions and, when retired in Australia, you can access all the capital tax free, or convert it into income which is also tax free. Says Collett: 'It is a win-win situation.' You can transfer UK pension contributions into an Australian superannuation fund once you have left the UK permanently and have earned income in Australia. So push as much money as possible into a UK pension fund while you can. On your existing savings, Justin Modray of Bestinvest advises: 'Her Barclays Open Plan account is not the best home for this money as it pays only 1.85 per cent gross a year. A more attractive option is the ING Direct account, paying 4.02 per cent.' He adds: 'She should continue using her Northern Rock \u00a33,000 cash Isa allowance each tax year, although Northern Rock does have a history of cutting rates, so Madeleine would be wise to keep abreast of any rate changes. The stock purchase plan gives a 15 per cent discount on the company's shares, which looks a good deal provided she is confident about her employer's fortunes.' Mark Dear, business development manager at Charcol Holden Meehan, suggests a different cash Isa next time: 'Safeway's has an attractive variable rate of 3.95 per cent. While there are better fixed rates available, I would be careful about investing in accounts which restrict access to capital in case Madeleine's plans change.' You could also think of moving the Barclays money to an offshore account, as long as you will not need to bring the money into the UK. Travis explains: 'For a UK resident but non-UK domiciliary, income from offshore investments is taxed in the UK only if brought into the country.' But sell any offshore investments when you get back home. Says Collett: 'Offshore accounts don't work in Australia. Australia's tax legislation will catch you because you are taxed wherever your money is.' You need to check with your local tax office about completing a tax return. You are likely to be a higher-rate tax payer, so ought to be paying additional tax on your bank interest. Madeleine's to do list 1. Switch your money from Barclays to ING, or to an offshore deposit account until you return to Australia. 2. Keep saving in Isas and the SAYE employer share scheme until you leave the UK. 3. Think about coming out of the employer share plan unless you are confident of the company's success. 4. Switch your UK pension fund to an Australian one when you start work in Australia. 5. Ask your local tax office if you should complete a tax return. 6. Put as much money as you can into a UK pension. Let us help you Do you need some financial coaching?
