Earlier he had hinted that gun activists might want to assassinate Hillary Clinton to prevent her appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court. In Britain, meanwhile, calls for the moderation of violent political language after the death of Jo Cox have not resulted in much reduction of the gleeful talk of \u201cstabbings\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and did not discourage Nigel Farage from exulting that the Brexit vote had been won \u201cwithout a shot being fired\u201d. In what some call an era of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, public discourse seems more abusive and angry, and further from the ideal of reasoned conversation about social goods, than ever before. Is our political language broken? Well, people have been complaining about the corruption of political language since political language existed. Confucius warned that a ruler should use the correct names for things, or social catastrophe would result. Orwell lamented that political language in his time was \u201cdesigned to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d. And the era of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d gave rise to a whole new constellation of what I call Unspeak: carefully engineered phrases designed to smuggle in a biased point of view and shut down thought and argument \u2013 like \u201cwar on terror\u201d itself. Nor is flat-out lying in politics anything new. There is a marvellous 18th-century pamphlet usually attributed to John Arbuthnot, friend of Swift and Pope and founder of the Scriblerus club. It describes a yet-to-be-written book, The Art of Political Lying, in which the author will show \u201cthat the People have a Right to private Truth from their Neighbours ... but that they have no Right at all to Political Truth\u201d. The coinage \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, indeed, implies that there was once a golden age of politics in which its elevated practitioners spoke nothing but perfect truth. The sun never dawned on such a day. But perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie repeatedly debunked. Arbuthnot cautioned that the same lie should not be \u201cobstinately insisted upon\u201d, but he did not live to see this strategy work so brilliantly during the EU referendum, with the Leave campaign\u2019s claim that we sent \u00a3350m a week to the EU. Shameless, too, was the haste with which this lie, having done its work, was disowned on the morning of the referendum result. It was a \u201cmistake\u201d, muttered Nigel Farage, before carefully lowering his snout back into the EU trough that continues to pay his MEP\u2019s salary. This rather called to mind Paul Wolfowitz\u2019s candid admission that the issue of Saddam\u2019s alleged WMD was chosen as the justification for the Iraq war \u201cfor bureaucratic reasons\u201d. The surprise, perhaps, is that you can show how the magic trick works, and people still believe it next time. Not so long ago it was \u201csoundbites\u201d that were thought to be corrupting political debate by reducing complex ideas to slogans. The 1988 US presidential election was called the \u201csoundbite election\u201d by some commentators, the most famous example being George HW Bush\u2019s promise: \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes.\u201d (Two years later Bush agreed to a bipartisan budget that did increase taxes.) It was a mysteriously brilliant piece of verbal engineering. Why would you have to read Bush\u2019s lips when you could hear what he was saying on the TV? But the surprising image and arresting rhythm made it stick. Soundbites and slogans (\u201cTake Back Control\u201d) still work. Trump, too, has a conventional campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. (Great how, exactly? By doing what? Don\u2019t ask.) But he gets most publicity for his antic, apparently off-the-cuff remarks that rhetorically perform an absence of rhetoric. His real genius might be read as a satirical absolutism about the first amendment. If speech is genuinely free, there should be no consequences to speech whatsoever. And, to the mystification of the commenting class, this is what Trump repeatedly finds to be the case. After the media furore surrounding Trump\u2019s claim that Obama founded Isis, he tweeted: \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d Thus he rows back from any outrageous claim dreamed up by a brain that works like a cleverly programmed internet meme-generator. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, all innocence, \u201cthat\u2019s what some people are saying.\u201d (No one was before he did.) Yet the idea Obama is the founder of Isis will stick in at least some voters\u2019 minds come polling day, as will the imaginary Mexican wall (though they will probably have forgotten its \u201cbig beautiful door\u201d) \u2013 just as the \u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d promise did for many Leave voters. Trump is not a perversion of the tradition of political campaigning; he is the logical culmination of it. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, if it helps you get elected. Trump is not a liar, exactly, but a bullshitter. According to the canonical definition by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt, a liar still cares about the truth because he wants to conceal it from you. A bullshitter, on the other hand, simply doesn\u2019t care what is true at all. Trump is merely the most energetic current exploiter of a fact that modern politicians have long known: the media is broken, and you can mercilessly exploit its flaws to your own benefit. (That, after all, is what \u201cspin doctors\u201d are for.) If you repeat a lie often enough, then that claim becomes the story, and it\u2019s what most people remember. And a structural confusion between \u201cimpartiality\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d undermines the mission to inform of institutions such as the BBC. To be impartial would be to point out untruths wherever they come from. But to be \u201cbalanced\u201d is to have a three-way between a presenter and two economists on opposite sides of some question. Never mind that one economist represents the views of 95% of the profession and the other is an ideologically blinkered outlier: the structure of the interview itself implies to the audience that the arguments are evenly divided. In the age of social media, moreover, dubious political claims are packed into atomised fragments and attract thousands of enthusiastic retweets, while the people who help to redistribute them are unlikely ever to see a rebuttal that comes later or in someone else\u2019s timeline. We\u2019ve all moved on. Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of \u201chappy firing\u201d (a term for the celebratory shooting of assault rifles into the sky). That lies can go viral more quickly than the truth is another old observation. In 1710 Jonathan Swift wrote: \u201cFalsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.\u201d But what is certain is that Twitter and Facebook now help it fly faster and further than ever before. Because attention is the currency of social media, public figures are incentivised to use outrage to vie for visibility, which further coarsens the public discourse \u2013 as when the American shock-journo Ann Coulter lately defended Trump by calling him a \u201cvictim of media rape\u201d who is being blamed for \u201cwearing a short skirt\u201d. Any such outburst these days, along with the wave of overt post-Brexit racism in Britain, may be defended as a healthy refusal to kowtow to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, a term that originally denoted the careful use of language so as not to needlessly upset people, and now just means common decency. What, then, is to be done? The modern bullshitting demagogue succeeds because he says arresting and often amusing things that cut through the anomie of those who feel left behind by politics as usual. Exquisitely reasoned liberal conversation is exactly what turns those voters off. Lately it has been notable that Hillary Clinton, not previously considered the wittiest person in US politics, has used an impressive array of scripted zingers to put down her opponent. What the bullshitters do so well is define the rules of the game, so perhaps their opponents will have to play it at least to this extent, while trying to keep the moral high ground by still caring about what is true and what isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not an edifying thought, but if the insurgent right is to have its Trumps and its Farages, maybe the centre and the left need their own versions too.
