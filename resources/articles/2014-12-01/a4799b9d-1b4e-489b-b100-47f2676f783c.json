But on securing some of the world\u2019s biggest sporting events, from the World Cup 2022 to the world athletics championships in 2019, the richest nation in the world per capita is now set on developing its own talent. To do so, the Qatar Athletics Federation has hired one of Britain\u2019s best-known distance runners in Liz McColgan-Nuttall to create a future for women\u2019s endurance running in Qatar. The former 10,000m world champion originally relocated to Qatar to be with her new husband, British Athletics\u2019 former head of endurance, John Nuttall, who now fulfils the same job at the Aspire Academy that produced Qatar\u2019s one internationally successful athlete, Mutaz Essa Barshim. It is the success of Barshim, the world indoor high jump champion who has also won world silver and Olympic bronze medals, that provides the template as well as the hope for a Qatari sporting legacy. Only four female athletes represented the nation at London 2012; McColgan-Nuttall has been selected as the woman to change that by identifying and nurturing potential endurance talent. First she has to find it and that is no easy task. The Scot describes Qatar as having a \u201cvery inexperienced [sporting] culture\u201d, where running itself is a new phenomenon for the girls she meets on school visits. \u201cThey\u2019ve never run. They don\u2019t play sport. The boys maybe play football but the girls don\u2019t do anything. So they really, really enjoy it. It\u2019s something so new to them. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you start coaching because they get all worried. They\u2019ve never been out of breath before. I need to explain to them that it\u2019s normal. Once you do that and they understand that it\u2019s normal they want to do it again. Or if they get tired and tight legs, and they think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve hurt myself,\u2019 and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know the feelings of exercise. It\u2019s just about giving them the confidence to do it, that it\u2019s normal they can train through it. Once you explain it they say: \u2018OK then, I\u2019m not having a heart attack ...\u2019 That\u2019s the sort of thing you go through.\u201d McColgan-Nuttall\u2019s remit is to scour schools for potential talent to compete \u2013 rather than win a medal \u2013 in 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s no medallists for 2019. It\u2019s more about just finding someone who has the talent to take part. Girls have not been encouraged to exercise in the past. On top of that I\u2019m trying to develop girls\u2019 running clubs because there\u2019s nothing set up for them as yet.\u201d The Scot is starting from scratch with an entire grassroots structure for girls\u2019 endurance running. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the senior groups get going, in the next five to 10 years hopefully you\u2019ll have good athletes in the team but it\u2019s going to take time to build up.\u201d The girls, aged nine and upwards, are more enthusiastic than the boys about their new opportunities. But there are cultural mind-sets to combat. Female endurance runners tend to wear minimal clothing to aid movement but like the Qatar women\u2019s basketball team that withdrew from the Asian Games in September over the no hijab ruling, it can be challenging to balance religious and sporting requirements. \u201cBecause of the religion they\u2019ve got a lot of problems with ladies and needing to cover up, so [in the past] they wouldn\u2019t really attempt [those sports]. \u201cNow they\u2019re just working around it. You see more and more sports becoming more accessible to women and girls. [With endurance running] if you put a pair of tights on and a long-sleeved T-shirt it doesn\u2019t really make a difference. Over the years I\u2019ve also run with tights and T-shirt and you get used to it, it\u2019s quite comfortable, there\u2019s no reason you need to run in a crop top and little bikini briefs.\u201d Another adjustment for the former Olympic silver medallist was Ramadan. \u201cAs a coach you\u2019ve got to work round it and respect the religion in the country. After sundown they can eat, so we just changed things around so they could train at night. It\u2019s all workable.\u201d Amid the cultural adjustments the biggest change of all came in leaving her daughter, the Olympic athlete Eilish McColgan. McColgan-Nuttall still coaches Eilish, setting training programmes over email and Skype, but the distance became painful when her daughter suffered heart palpitations while visiting Doha in April this year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice at all,\u201d says McColgan-Nuttall, who coached Eilish to win the British steeplechase title and admits she cannot help worrying about her. \u201cShe had it genetically. When she was younger she had a little something with it but it\u2019s never come back to bother her until she came out here. I think there\u2019s something always been not quite right with it but it didn\u2019t manifest itself.\u201d Eilish trains at Loughborough alongside the European cross-country champion, Gemma Steel \u2013 coached by her new stepfather, Nuttall \u2013 and her mother says she is well drilled in providing feedback on how her body responds. \u201cShe knows her body well and I\u2019m confident in what she says. The programme she gets she follows it meticulously, so it kind of works out all right. \u201cShe made the decision that she wants to run. We\u2019ll see where she goes with it. Worst-case scenario she might have an operation for it but at the minute we\u2019re just trying to manage it and allow her to train. She monitors the heart well [with regular ECG tests] and we\u2019re very aware of anything symptomatic \u2013 she just changes her programme but the last couple of months she\u2019s had only one episode so it\u2019s been good.\u201d Eilish plans to compete in the indoor season in 2015, and McColgan-Nuttall says her daughter is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d despite her condition. One issue McColgan-Nuttall cannot escape, however, is the never-ending flow of negative news stories about Qatar \u2013 from human rights organisations condemning World Cup worker fatalities and allegations of corruption in securing the 2022 World Cup to athletes\u2019 fears over the effects of extreme temperatures at global sporting competitions such as the 2019 world athletics championships \u2013 all of which have left the tiny Gulf state struggling to convince the world about its suitability as a sporting events host. How does McColgan-Nuttall see it? \u201cI feel with Doha the problems that have been highlighted, they\u2019re actually trying to sort out. There\u2019s a lot of workers over here. For instance, I know a company that goes into the camps and does a sports delivery programme where they play cricket in the workers\u2019 camps, they also give them free phonecalls, things like that. \u201cLook at China [hosting the world championships in 2015], look at the drugs in Rio, the way they flattened the slums. There\u2019s always a down side of where a successful bid is taking place. I think the world championships coming to Doha is great for the sport and it\u2019s great for women in sport because it gives them the opportunity to access it. I think if it does that, that\u2019s half the battle won.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
