Prices rose faster (at 6.7 per cent) in the quarter to 30 June than they did in the UK as a whole (3.3 per cent). The average price in Glasgow went over \u00a3100,000 for the first time. \u00b7 Buy-to-let investors have become 'more cautious' as house prices have increased (and yields have declined) over the last couple of years, according to UCB Home Loans. For instance, a \u00a3100,000, two-bedroomed tenement flat in Edinburgh, yielding monthly rent of about \u00a3650 two years ago, would now cost almost twice that amount - halving the yield. But UCB says: 'The opening of the Scottish parliament still promises to boost house prices, resulting in interest in buy-to-let purchases still being quite strong.' Growing student numbers - boosted by the absence of fees in Scotland - also help the markets in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Aberdeen and St Andrews. \u00b7 The Edinburgh buy-to-let market has 'picked up' after a slow start to the year, according to Dove Davies &amp; Partners. 'There is still a good selection of properties available, allowing tenants to pick and chose the best-quality property,' says a spokesman. \u00b7 Scotland has the most affordable housing in the UK. The average house price is 3.1 times average earnings (compared to 4.7 per cent for the UK overall)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
