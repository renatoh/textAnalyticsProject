David Jordan, acting director of operations at the Environment Agency, said the continued storage of 26m litres of the water at the nearby Thames Water Maple Cross sewage works was unacceptable. Some 800,000 litres of stored firewater, laced with hazardous chemicals and spent firefighting foam, leaked from a separate site into the River Colne last month. In a letter sent yesterday to Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd and seen by the Guardian, Mr Jordan writes: \"The delay, now seven months, in submitting proposals to remove this risk is, in our view, a dereliction of your responsibilities to protect the environment.\" An earlier letter sent to the companies after last month's spill has been ignored, he adds. Colin Chiverton of the agency said: \"We never envisaged it would take this long. As long as the firewater is stored it remains a hazard.\" He said the delays were down to legal issues - technical consultants have already agreed to use technologies such as reverse osmosis and activated charcoal to clean up the water. The agency has ordered urgent checks on the remaining storage tanks, which hold the water and foam used on the inferno by 650 firefighters. The water was tankered away after it collected behind a protective bund on the site, designed to contain the spill if an oil tank ruptured. The firewater released during last month's leak - from a tank at a sewage works, near Radlett - was not as severely contaminated, because it was made up of rain and drainage water collected from outside the bund. River water tests at 12 sites did not pick up any serious pollution. The depot fire on December 11 started after a faulty gauge allowed thousands of gallons of unleaded petrol to be pumped into the already full tank at the site near Hemel Hempstead. More than 300 tonnes of fuel gushed unnoticed for 40 minutes from the top of the tank and the resulting vapour cloud ignited and injured 43 people, two of them seriously. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Limited said: \"HOSL has commissioned independent tests into various techniques to filter out the contaminants in the firewater and intends to present the results of the tests, together with recommendations for treatment and safe disposal of this water, to the Environment Agency and the water companies in the near future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
