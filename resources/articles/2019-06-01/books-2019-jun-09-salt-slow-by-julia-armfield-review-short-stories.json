Lovers turn to stone or rise from the dead. A PhD student collects male body parts to stick on to the lifesize outline she\u2019s been hiding in her cellar. One protagonist shapeshifts into an insect; another gains a wolf for a stepsister. These tales draw thrilling vigour from Armfield\u2019s conscientiously vivid approach to their dialled-up reality. An insomnia epidemic in one story sees sufferers stalked by their own sleep, mutinous and anthropomorphised. Television, we\u2019re told in passing, isn\u2019t really viable any more: \u201cFairly early on, a live morning show with a viewership of some 4 million was yanked unceremoniously off air because the host had been attempting to present a segment on seasonal salads with his Sleep in shot behind him.\u201d Speckled with zoological terminology and unexpected collective nouns (\u201can anthology of cousins\u201d), Salt Slow shares virtues and flaws with Daisy Johnson\u2019s atmospheric 2016 collection Fen. Often the creepy goings-on act as a magical-realist delivery mechanism for avenging male exploitation of women\u2019s bodies, although we can\u2019t always tell for sure: one story, Stop Your Women\u2019s Ears With Wax, runs on ominous hints of killings carried out by the cult-like fans of a girl band whose members perhaps aren\u2019t human. But the book\u2019s punchlines, while striking, can feel superficial, as in the denouement of Mantis, in which a girl turns the tables on the boy attempting to coerce her into sex at a party. The best stories retain emotional texture when treating this recurring theme of adolescent trials: the narrator who gets a wolf for a stepsister isn\u2019t best pleased at first, but comes round once the new family member accompanies her home from school and gives a pestering classmate more than he bargained for. There\u2019s a change of emphasis in the doomy title story, a kind of coded body horror involving a pregnant woman adrift at sea with her lover amid apocalyptic flooding. We\u2019re blindsided when the apparent predicament of how the protagonist can give birth in such dire circumstances is dwarfed by an even more outlandish crisis. The trouble is, it feels like weirdness piled on weirdness. For all the shivers and shudders, Armfield\u2019s habit of using everyday turning points as a diving board to plunge into the uncanny can look like a way to wriggle out of eyeballing its depths. Still, on this showing, she\u2019s a writer whose next move you wouldn\u2019t want to miss. \u2022 Salt Slow by Julia Armfield is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a312.99).
