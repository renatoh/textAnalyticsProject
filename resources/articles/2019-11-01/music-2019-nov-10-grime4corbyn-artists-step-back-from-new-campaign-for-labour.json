The movement, which was part of the so-called \u201cyouthquake\u201d during the 2017 general election when Labour motivated under-45s to vote, was a missed opportunity, according to several acts who feel let down by the way they have been treated since. The organisation\u2019s website is no longer active, and there are no planned gigs or events during the current election campaign. Former vocal supporters Novelist and AJ Tracey, who appeared in a video expressing his support for Corbyn ahead of the 2017 election, declined to discuss their previous involvement with the campaign. Krucial, a grime artist who wrote in the Guardian about his decision to support Corbyn in 2017, said at the time it was important to make sure it was not seen as a \u201cone-off, viral trend\u201d like the Ice Bucket or Mannequin Challenge. According to some acts, however, that is exactly what happened. \u201cThe general consensus is that they were used,\u201d said one grime manager, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey didn\u2019t follow up. They weren\u2019t expecting a general election so soon, and it\u2019s a bit late to go to the grime community now after ignoring us.\u201d In a recent interview with the Observer, Tracey said he would not be voting for Corbyn this time, and that he gave his support in 2017 because he was the \u201cbest of a bad bunch\u201d. \u201cIt actually helped him a lot and I feel like he didn\u2019t capitalise on it,\u201d he said of Grime4Corbyn. \u201cHe didn\u2019t utilise what he had.\u201d Several other grime acts, including JME \u2013 who interviewed Corbyn and helped to inspire the movement \u2013 did not respond to a request to take part. Skepta, JME\u2019s older brother and winner of the 2016 Mercury prize, has been another vocal critic of political groups\u2019 use of grime. In an interview with Q, Skepta \u2013 real name Joseph Junior Adenuga \u2013 said acts sold \u201cthemselves for fucking bullshit\u201d and that four months after the campaign, politicians \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck about us again\u201d. Organisers of Grime4Corbyn reject the idea the party manipulated or used acts. Adam Cooper, one of the group\u2019s organisers, said the group had run workshops, and had been invited to colleges and youth clubs to discuss the campaign and its impact since 2017. It also signed an open letter criticising the injunctions imposed on drill rappers preventing them from performing certain tracks because of violent lyrics. \u201cYou can\u2019t really please everyone,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cI think doing the less high-profile work after the election: going to youth clubs, colleges and running workshops might have given the impression that we disappeared. Or that we weren\u2019t continuing the momentum and that wasn\u2019t really the case.\u201d Members of the Grime4Corbyn team are involved in Fck Boris, a street party with dance music at its core that hosted an inaugural event in London in July. Another is planned in Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge constituency on 16 November, with more than a dozen other events planned in places including Barnet, Glasgow, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, Hendon and Kensington. Cooper, who is part of Fck Boris, thinks that it makes sense to shift focus. \u201cGrime this isn\u2019t as popular today as it was. A lot more people are listening to Afrobeats, to drill and other kinds of music,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, the discourse around young people has changed. \u2018Fuck Boris\u2019 is something that Stormzy is saying, it\u2019s something that Slowthai is saying. It\u2019s a different kind of energy and that should be built upon.\u201d Stormzy\u2019s image is used by the group, but the artist who shouted \u201cfuck Boris\u201d during his headline Glastonbury set in June and told the Guardian about his admiration for Corbyn in 2016, has not given it his official endorsement. Johnson later claimed Stormzy actually said \u201cback Boris\u201d. \u201cIt seems like this election date was chosen to prevent the student vote having an impact,\u201d a spokesperson for Fck Boris said. \u201cBoris is trying to prevent certain groups from voting and we\u2019re doing mass registrations to counter that.\u201d Lester Holloway, who worked for Operation Black Vote in the run up to the 2017 election, said: \u201cGrime4Corbyn made a big difference in the last general election.\u201d He said the 77% share of the ethnic minority vote that Labour won in 2017 was helped by grassroots initiatives, such as Grime4Corbyn, which targeted younger voters. Moving on from grime to something else makes sense for both activists and Labour, he added. \u201cYou need something new and fresh, so they probably don\u2019t want to make it too boring by repeating themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of what they do, we\u2019re still very likely to see a large portion of the BAME community voting for Labour.\u201d A Labour insider said there was ongoing contact with some grime acts but that no events could be announced for the time being."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
