In A Radical Romance she uses a similar approach to more recent and personal history \u2013 her 10-year marriage to the radical historian Raphael Samuel, until his death in 1996. She draws on her own extensive diaries and letters to offer a hybrid memoir that is at once a tribute to Samuel and his work, a portrait of a part of London in the grip of accelerated social change, and an account of love, frustration and grief. Perhaps inevitably, these different currents vie with one another for precedence, but Light is keenly aware of these tensions, interrogating her own process and the nature of memoir as history, \u201ca history from inside\u201d: \u201cMemoir weaves its way between what is often called the private and the public, the personal as opposed to the historical\u2026 I find these terms far more porous than absolute.\u201d Light married Samuel in 1987, when she was 30 and he 50. He was one of a breed now almost extinct, the public intellectual: well established as a historian, from a secular Jewish family, raised in the British Communist party, the author of numerous volumes of social history. She was a first-generation graduate from Portsmouth, with a teaching job at Brighton Polytechnic, who had abandoned an engagement to enjoy a kind of independence unknown to her mother\u2019s generation: \u201cMy solitude was also shored up by the laws that had given women this relatively new freedom in British life. It depended on me renting or mortgaging under my own name and being left to live alone unmolested, on free and available contraception and the possibility of paid work.\u201d \u201cFeminism,\u201d she writes, \u201clike writing, was a wedge prising my life open.\u201d Yet her romance with Samuel created an abrupt change of direction. \u201cFalling in love is a mystery that only in retrospect becomes blindingly obvious: how could I not have fallen for him? I ask myself years later. But what makes us take that leap?\u201d It is a question she does not answer wholly satisfactorily. Samuel was clearly enormously charismatic; within weeks he had proposed and Light moved into his busy, book-filled house in Spitalfields. Shortly after the wedding, she has a kind of breakdown, and here the tensions between the different modes of the book become most strained. The way she writes about this feels frustratingly oblique, at least to a reader acclimatised to a more confessional type of memoir, as if the desire to examine her own experience meets a reluctance to speak too critically of her late husband. It seems clear that the way her life becomes subsumed into his, creating an increasing sense of isolation and questioning of identity, is the catalyst for her collapse. Samuel \u2013 raised to dismiss the idea of the self \u2013 tells her that her depression is an \u201chonourable\u201d response to the gentrification of Spitalfields, east London. Gradually they find accommodation with a shared life, until the shock of his cancer diagnosis at 61. The real heart of the book is the final third, Mourning; though written at 20 years\u2019 distance from the grief it describes, this section allows an intimacy that feels absent from previous sections, which deliberately turn away from the overly personal to broaden into wider social history. Here she writes with precision and tenderness about loss, and how the conflict between the public and private self is made concrete when the dead person has left behind an archive that must be preserved. \u201cSorrow, like guilt, never ends, though it ebbs and flows,\u201d she writes. \u201cI have never \u2018got over\u2019 Raphael\u2019s death; it sliced my life in two.\u201d A Radical Romance is an admirable tribute to a man, a period of rapid change in London, and an unusual marriage, but I wish that the author had stepped out of his shadow more often. \u2022 A Radical Romance: A Memoir of Love, Grief and Consolation by Alison Light is published by Penguin Fig Tree (\u00a320).
