Liverpool equalled Manchester City\u2019s record of 20 consecutive Premier League home wins with the 4-0 victory and their emphatic lead at the summit represents the biggest advantage any team has enjoyed at this stage of a season. Klopp\u2019s team are also unbeaten in 42 top-flight games but the manager insists there is no feeling of invincibility within his squad and only continued hard work will land the club\u2019s first league title for 30 years. \u201cI promise you I don\u2019t lie but we just don\u2019t feel it,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cI am a very optimistic person but not before a football game. My main feeling before the game was concern. They had too many shots but what Ali [Alisson] is doing to make the saves look so simple I have no clue. The finishes were good but Ali is there. \u201cWe are not perfect, not even close to being perfect, but we don\u2019t care about being perfect. We just try and use our skills in the best possible way. The boys do that and that is why we have these kind of numbers. It just feels like the hardest work. Now the boys can go away and enjoy their break and come back recharged.\u201d On Liverpool\u2019s phenomenal winning run, he said: \u201cI have never seen it before. But it is not that I feel stronger and stronger after each win. It is just one great celebration, sometimes more, sometimes less, then relief, settle and go again. \u201cI have no clue how it should feel. We have a week off and then we go again. So many things can happen in football and we have to use the skills and character of the boys and the power of this club and this stadium. It is our duty to win football games.\u201d Despite the margin of Liverpool\u2019s win, Southampton made life difficult for the leaders and argued for a penalty when Fabinho caught Danny Ings moments before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the visitors\u2019 manager, said: \u201cThe difference was the first goal. If we score it, maybe the second half is completely different but they get a lift from scoring it and they are so strong. I don\u2019t see the reason why [Ings] should go down. He is alone in front of the keeper. [Fabinho] hits him twice. It will not happen that Liverpool scores and the referee goes back and gives us a penalty.\u201d Klopp cited a half-time positional change of Fabinho as key to his team\u2019s improvement, rather than Southampton\u2019s rejected penalty appeal. \u201cWow, what a team Southampton is,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so long in football and I never saw a turnaround like that. I saw them playing against Chelsea a few months ago and I was really worried for them. That kind of turnaround is exceptional. \u201cWe had the problems in the first half because we lost the balls in the wrong moments. We had to change two or three things, most important the role of Fabinho, and then we started rolling. Southampton wanted a penalty, I didn\u2019t see it back but Oxlade scored a sensational goal. The strange thing is that Southampton could have won it as well. That shows how difficult it was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
