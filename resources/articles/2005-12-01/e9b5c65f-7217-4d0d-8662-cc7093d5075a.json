Even if you can see the join, the result is a fascinating hybrid in which a Restoration comedy about marital incompatibility turns into a Pirandellian study of illusion and reality. Vanbrugh clearly set out to write a robustly realistic study of an ailing marriage. A rustic MP is transplanted to London and finds his wife ardently pursued by a lecherous colonel. But Saunders shifts the focus on to the MP's pert daughter and her lowly female companion. The former takes her mother's place with the colonel in a variation on the Shakespearean bed trick. The latter discards her allotted role as an exploited servant. Both discover, in short, the transforming power of play. Some of Saunders' plotting is a bit convoluted and I regret that he loses sight of the country member's experience of the Westminster cesspit. But the play tells us a lot about Saunders's obsessions. In Next Time I'll Sing to You he showed how an actor playing an Essex hermit was transfigured by the role. Here he suggests that women can achieve sexual dominance by acknowledging the power of illusion. The MP's daughter, in outwitting the snake-like colonel, matures emotionally, and her female chum learns that social status is a game in which the rules are largely dictated by men. Sam Walters' production gives the crowded plot momentum and there is a host of good performances. Sophie Trott as the disguised daughter, Claudia Elmhirst as her flowering friend and Fiona Mollison as a flighty aristo toying with husband and lover ensure that this is a play in which women call the shots. But, even if the men are kept down, John Hodgkinson as the out-manouevred colonel and Thomas Wheatley as a superbly disgruntled host have their moments. Vanbrugh and Saunders may make an odd marriage but it's one that finally achieves fruitful consummation. \u00b7 Until February 11.
