York are up for sale and there is said to be a seething acrimonious split between the board and supporters over the future. But the queue is orderly, the people are quiet and the only whispers of discontent concern a penalty miss by Graham \"Harry\" Potter. The attendance is 2,317, one of the lowest of the season. Two: the office of the manager Terry Dolan after the match. Dolan and Rochdale's new manager John Hollins, lager in hand, stare at page 326 of Ceefax to see how the night's results have affected the table. In comes one of the directors perceived by fans as selling out. He is Barry Swallow, a former player, indeed York City's \"hero of the millennium\". He passes a dossier to Dolan covered in arrows. It has come from Martin Ferguson, Sir Alex's brother, and contains all you need to know about Fulham. \"Who've they got playing on the wing?\" asks Hollins. \"Robin Hood?\" Three: an hour later and York's senior pro, the Northern Ireland international goalkeeper Alan Fettis, is sitting in a hotel bar beneath a watercolour of York's most famous street, the Shambles. He has one drink and leaves. In that short time, though, he manages to display moods swinging from cautious optimism to outright pessimism. He combines hope and economic realism with humour as black as his Guinness. Shambles is again mentioned, but not in terms of picturesque cobbled streets. Fettis, 30, arrived two years ago on a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers and is involved in York's third struggle to avoid a humiliating exit from the Football League. He led a delegation of the players to see the chairman Douglas Craig, an ageing former Tory councillor who, with three fellow directors, sparked supporter unrest by transferring the ownership of club and ground into a holding company of which he controls 62%. Unsurprisingly, Fettis and the rest of his team-mates do not appear to have come away completely satisfied with what they heard. Having spoken of the club's potential, Fettis then returned to the uncertainty caused by the board's December decision to sell up. Some on longer contracts, as is Fettis, have been told they will have them honoured by one of the two parties interested in buying the club before the March 31 deadline. But eight of the 20 professionals will be out of contract come May and for them there are no guarantees. \"The only time you can concentrate is when you're out there,\" Fettis said. \"When you're together as a group on your own you start to worry. A lot of us have made commitments, moved here, bought houses. It's a shambles. Again.\" Fettis has been through this before with Hull City, and he is not the only one: his manager then was Dolan. At least, Fettis said, York have assets; Hull, where players were at one stage paid in cash, was a \"brown envelopes\" situation. Dolan, too, chose to compare York favourably with Hull five years ago, although in those pre-Bosman days Hull at least had a chance of saving themselves. \"Three times we staved off closure at Hull by selling players on the last day,\" he said. \"Now clubs are not buying players from below.\" A safety net has been snatched away from clubs such as York and Dolan reckons they will be \u00a3500,000 in debt by the summer. He has been responsible for little of that - in fact in his 23 months in charge he has sold players to the value of \u00a3200,000, reduced the size of the squad from 32 to 20 and spent nothing. At the same time York have played nine FA Cup ties and lost one, to Leicester City. Seven of the other eight were also against higher-division opponents. \"Maybe we should play at a higher level,\" Dolan said wryly. Any level will do this time next year. As long as York City are alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
