An internal memo said it would make the cuts after it identified those \"who are not up to our standards\". Morgan Stanley will also cut the number of new broker recruits from 2,400 this year to 1,000 in 2006. The division has about 10,500 brokers. The cuts are one of the first actions taken since John Mack returned to the bank as chief executive, following the forced resignation of Philip Purcell earlier this year. The retail brokerage division has been a focus of criticism from investors frustrated by the long under-performance of the Morgan Stanley share price. The division, which caters for individual investors, has struggled and in the second quarter reported an 11% fall in profits to $118m (\u00a367m). The acting president, Zoe Cruz, who wrote the memo, said the firm remained committed to the brokerage business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
