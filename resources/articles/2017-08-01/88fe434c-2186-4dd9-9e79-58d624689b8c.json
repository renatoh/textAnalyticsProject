White supremacists had gathered in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee and were met by counter-protesters. On Saturday, a car was driven into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters, killing one woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer. On Saturday Chris Long, who won the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots last season, offered a withering assessment of the far-right protesters, who took to the streets with torches. \u201cInsanely frustrating. Evolution will favor the self assured ... not man babies with tiki torches or people playing \u2018militia\u2019,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Long chose not to attend the Patriots\u2019 visit to the White House to meet Donald Trump after their Super Bowl victory. Chris Long added on Sunday that most people from Charlottesville would have objected to the far-right demonstrators. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen statistics but I\u2019d be willing to bet the vast majority of people voicing those white supremacist sentiments were from out of town,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the people that were defending our hometown against ideals like that were from Charlottesville, or students. It\u2019s disheartening but I really think it\u2019s desperation for those folks to feel threatened by us doing the right thing.\u201d On Saturday, LeBron James took a swipe at Trump, who has been criticized for not condemning the white supremacists specifically. \u201cIt\u2019s sad what\u2019s going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh?! He said that,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The Washington Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle, who attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, also condemned the weekend\u2019s scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s past the point of hearing what they have to say, spreading this kind of hatred,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cSaying, \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2026 You aren\u2019t the ones at the risk of being quote-unquote replaced by some of this administration\u2019s policies. And it\u2019s just white fear. It\u2019s the worst kind of hatred. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Kyle Long echoed his brother Chris\u2019s comments about his hometown. \u201cObviously, people ask, \u2018You\u2019re from Charlottesville?\u2019 it kind of leaves a bad taste in their mouths thinking that one of their guys is from Charlottesville, where they see all these rallies and stuff happening. Like I said, don\u2019t let a few bad apples ruin what is really true about Charlottesville and that area \u2013 there\u2019s good folks there,\u201d said the Chicago Bears offensive guard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
