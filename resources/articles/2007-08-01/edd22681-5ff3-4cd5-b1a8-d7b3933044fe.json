Another recovery saw Mark Selby turn arrears of 31 into a 5-3 victory over John Higgins, to whom he lost the Crucible final, with a four-frame winning streak which included breaks of 90, 74, 131 and 57. Graeme Dott, the 2006 world champion, took advantage of a lacklustre performance from Ding Junhui to beat the 20-year-old Chinese 5-1. Dott will now play Stephen Lee, a 5-3 winner over Stephen Hendry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
