One September morning they were transformed by an act of epochal terror into our contemporary nightmare. Live on TV. Sooner or later, and usually sooner, TV turns everything into a cliche - that's its role, to render the exceptional familiar. But no matter how many times those scenes are replayed they seem impervious to normalisation. Not that that has stopped TV from trying. Even in a documentary such as 9/11: Millionaire Widows, ostensibly about the trouble caused by compensation pay-outs, we saw multi-angle shots of the aircraft smashing into the World Trade Centre. So varied and prolific was their use that the rest of the film seemed somehow gratuitous, as if it were little more than an excuse for revisiting the mesmerising horror. The fact is, very few human stories, however sad or tawdry, can match the spectacular iconography of mass carnage. As 9/11: the Twin Towers was restricted to the action of that day rather than its emotional aftermath, footage of the plane crashes proved integral to this first-rate docu-drama. It kept largely to a format established, or perfected, by Kevin Macdonald in Touching The Void. Which is to say, simple interviews with the participants, conducted against a plain backdrop, interspersed with accurate recreations of events. Thus we saw an extraordinary, computer-generated shot of one banker who watched in paralysed disbelief as the hijacked aircraft headed straight at him in his office in the South Tower. The crash area stretched from the 77th floor up to the 85th. The banker, who had only just returned to his desk having been sent back after the attack on the North Tower, was on the 81st. He survived. He did so because another worker heard his dull cries and abandoned his own escape to save a stranger. There were several similarly heroic stories, humanity responding at its best to humanity at its worst. The most haunting testimonies, however, were those that professed cowardice. One survivor recalled seeing the 'deepest, richest black I've ever seen' in a hallway he was unable to make himself walk through. Two of his colleagues managed and both perished. Beneath his watering eyes were two grey sacks of despair that suggested sleep had been an infrequent visitor in the past five years. More than anything, what 9/11: the Twin Towers helped us remember were the victims who can't forget. Saddam's Road to Hell was that most rare of documentaries, a film shot in Iraq outside the relative safety of the Green Zone. Gwynne Roberts followed Dr Mohammed Ihsan, the Kurdish human rights minister, as he tried to discover what became of the bodies of the 8,000 Kurdish men and boys of the Barzani clan murdered by Saddam Hussein in 1983 in a rehearsal for his Anfal campaign to exterminate the Kurds. The first stop was the appropriately named Hotel Babylon in Baghdad. 'Anyone comes after 12 o'clock and I kill them,' said one of Ihsan's bodyguards, holding an automatic rifle. 'No excuses.' So presumably no room service either. Some viewers of Celebrity Big Brother may recall George Galloway telling Rula Lenska that life in Iraq was fine for those who didn't try to oppose Saddam. This film documented what happened to those who did oppose the indefatigible one. It spoke to survivors of Nagra Salman, a desert death camp that made the abomination of Abu Ghraib look like Ford open prison. To the eternal shame of the Thatcher government, Britain supported Iraq while Saddam and Ali Hassan al-Majid, 'Chemical Ali', put to death as many as 100,000 Kurds. The hell that was Saddam's Iraq was kept out of view and you can pretty much kill as many as you like as long as the TV cameras can't see. The hell that is Iraq today is all too visible, if someone is brave or foolhardy enough to go out and film it - three of the team died during the shoot, including Roberts's co-filmmaker. What Roberts showed is that the suspicion between the Sunnis and Kurds and Shias is irreparable and therefore the break-up of Iraq inevitable. As the 'evil Americans' only received the briefest of walk-on parts, this sobering, complex and disturbing film did not conform to liberal orthodoxies. Which is perhaps why it was hidden away in the nether lands of More4. For a more standard - make that double-standard - view on a current political issue there was Don't Get Me Started, in which Stewart Lee looked at the blasphemy debate. As co-author of Jerry Springer the Opera, he could be forgiven, perhaps, for concentrating on Christian protesters. But not for misrepresenting the threat from elsewhere. In Lee's view of the world, it seems to be that fundamentalists who brandish guitars (ie Christian) are silly and fit to be mocked. Whereas fundamentalists who brandish guns (ie Islamic) have sensitivities that should be respected. How courageous and convenient. It was Lee, of course, who appeared on the Today programme earlier this year during the Danish cartoon crisis to defend Muslim pieties. Because Islam had avoided the commercial exploitation that marked the Catholic church, he argued, then it should not be ridiculed. So fine to deride cheesy trinkets but not suicide bombing in the name of Allah. On Don't Get Me Started Lee loaded the dice once more by claiming that the Danish cartoons were 'clumsy jokes' and that newspapers had to decide whether the 'artistic value of the cartoons outweighed the risk of violent reprisals'. Wrong. Utterly wrong. It was the news value of the cartoons - they were supposed to be the cause of international riots and a boycott of Danish goods - that was the vital point. The idea that if the cartoonists had demonstrated better draughtsmanship then newspapers would have rushed to publish them is an absurd fallacy that even the Bible and the Koran would struggle to rival. You can almost hear the rousing chorus of editors throughout the free world: 'Who cares about being slaughtered in the street, that turban is just so well drawn!' It's all very well showing clips from The Life of Brian and Jerry Springer the Opera and taking fearless aim at - yawn - Blair and Bush, but if Lee was too offended by the penmanship of the Danish cartoons to show them, why didn't he read a few lines from The Satanic Verses? Smug and evasive, it was like dealing with organised crime by targeting the late return of library books. Far more amusing and perceptive were The Beginner's Guide to Islam and The Beginner's Guide to L Ron Hubbard. Peaches Geldof was a revelation in the former. She was escorted around Marrakesh - 'it reminds me a bit of Camden market' - by a series of female Muslim minders. The first explained to her the benefit of modest clothing: 'You get into paradise.' 'Oh cool,' said Geldof, 'so what's the dress-code?' as if paradise were a club in Chelsea. And Hardeep Singh Kohli provided a hysterical, though not unsympathetic, insight into the workings of Scientology - in fact, a heretical offshoot, as the Scientologists refused to see a comedian. Their loss. The Charlotte Church Show was repeated last Thursday, though it hadn't really been ready for its first screening. Church herself is sparky and confident in that naughty Friday night way that requires an ease with swearing. But the programme itself is something of a shambles. A mixture of a chat show without the chat and an entertainment show without enough acts, it relies heavily on Church's celebrity status. She tells anecdotes, does accents and dresses up in disguise. She's not bad at most of them and, of course, she can sing a bit too. Yet as if to show how thinly she was stretched, she complained about the media's preoccupation with the weight of celebrities. She cited herself and Nicole Richie as an example of this unfair attention. Ten minutes earlier she'd laughed at a blown-up pap shot of an overweight Cherie Blair and made fun of how anorexic Richie looked. If Church wants to have her cake she had better learn not to eat it. Aftersun was one of those frustrating dramas that were good enough to have been better. A story of a middle-aged couple's disastrous holiday in a sun-kissed Spanish villa, it featured Sarah Parish and some sharp observation. Parish's husband, played by an overwrought Peter Capaldi, was the kind of guy who likes to read Antony Beevor books next to a pool and say things like, 'Stalingrad was a brutal, brutal conflict.' To believe in him was to not believe in the marriage, which meant that the happy ending felt even more tacked on than usual. There may have been a clear blue sky but this time TV got the better of truth in the doomed war against cliche. \u00b7 What do you think? review@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
