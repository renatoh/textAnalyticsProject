Blew (1989) Along with Mudhoney\u2019s Sweet Young Thing Ain\u2019t Sweet No More, Nirvana\u2019s second single defined the initial sound of grunge: deeply unfashionable early-70s heavy rock refracted through a punk lens, where sludgy riffs met Ramones-ish third wall breaking (\u201chere is another word that rhymes with shame\u201d) and a coda so repetitious it sounded as if the record were stuck. 19. Territorial Pissings (1991) An excoriation of machismo and sexism, Nirvana tended to launch into the H\u00fcsker D\u00fc-ish Territorial Pissings on TV shows where they were expected to play their new single: from the baby boomer-baiting strangulated verse of the Youngbloods\u2019 Get Together that opens it to its frenetic screamed coda, it\u2019s a glorious two fingers to the world. 18. Lithium (1991) With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising that Nevermind \u2013 an album packing choruses as air-punch-inducing as Lithium\u2019s cry of \u201cyeah!\u201d \u2013 became huge. Behind it, however, lurks an intriguingly equivocal song about the comforts of faith \u2013 not, it has to be said, a topic regularly addressed in the US post-punk underground whence Nirvana sprang. 17. Rape Me (1993) It says something about Nirvana\u2019s skill that swathes of In Utero deal with the usually dispiriting topic of a band complaining about their treatment by the press without slipping into sanctimonious Mr Writer-ish finger wagging. Rape Me is a case in point. It sounds both horrified and resigned: a man who, by all accounts, had been very ambitious cautioning to be careful what you wish for. 16. Sappy (1990-93) Depending on your perspective, a song about Kurt Cobain\u2019s pet turtle or an abusive relationship, Sappy was an outtake that deserved better, something Nirvana knew, playing it live for years and recording it over and over before defeatedly slipping it out as a hidden track on a charity compilation. A posthumous remix included on the deluxe version of In Utero reveals its melancholy potency. 15. Scentless Apprentice (1993) The comedian Billy Connolly once opined that the words \u201cgo away\u201d could never have the same impact as the words \u201cfuck off\u201d. He had clearly never heard the scourging din of Scentless Apprentice, on which Cobain\u2019s agonised screaming of the seemingly innocuous phrase offers a deeply disturbing insight into the singer\u2019s post-fame state of mind. 14. Polly (1991) No song came to represent the gulf between Nirvana and some sections of their newfound audience quite as starkly as Polly, a horrifying depiction of a rape that ended up cited in an actual rape case: its perpetrators sang it to their victim. The song itself is stark and acoustic: it rams its subject matter in the listener\u2019s face, rather than coating it in distortion and rock dynamics. 13. School (1989) Given what happened to Cobain, there is an understandable tendency to look for angst throughout Nirvana\u2019s catalogue. But they had a goofy sense of humour, at least at first: School\u2019s power comes from the ridiculous level of import the music\u2019s heaviness lends a lyric about getting a job as a janitor at your former alma mater, and envying the students\u2019 break time. 12. Something in the Way (1991) The title of Nevermind\u2019s most poignant track turned the Beatles\u2019 most ardent love song into a reference to an obstruction. Its lyrics offered the stark image of a homeless person dying, unnoticed, under a tarpaulin by a river, the music was hushed and haunting, Cobain\u2019s voice barely rising above a murmur. 11. Been a Son (1989) No one, least of all Nirvana themselves, could have predicted Nevermind\u2019s success, but with hindsight, their early catalogue is sprinkled with suggestions that they were not the same as their grunge peers, among them the B-side Been a Son: a study of teenage alienation and gender that dispenses with the heaviness of Bleach in favour of a simple, relentless, unforgettable melody. 10. Drain You (1991) Kurt Cobain claimed Drain You was the equal of \u201cor better than\u201d Smells Like Teen Spirit, and he had a point: another in his line of slightly warped love songs, it shifts from a sparkling verse to an extended, improvised and faintly psychedelic interlude, by way of squeaky toys and aerosols being sprayed, and ends with one of Cobain\u2019s most startling screams. Dave Grohl compared it to Bohemian Rhapsody, which is perhaps pushing it a bit. 9. Dumb (1993) Typically, In Utero\u2019s calmest moment is a troubled paean to drugged-out indolence: the lyrics alternate between a kind of glassy-eyed transcendence and a fretful acknowledgment that the only time the narrator is happy is when they\u2019re stoned, their gathering darkness scratching at the sweetness of the tune and the simplicity of the arrangement. 8. About a Girl (1989) The highlight of debut album Bleach was a step away from the emotional terrain mined by, say, Nirvana\u2019s Sub Pop labelmates Mudhoney: they tended to deal in hedonism and alienation, but About a Girl was a surprisingly sweet and earnest love song that betrayed Cobain\u2019s love of tuneful-but-rickety British indie pop. 7. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (1993, released 1994) Nirvana were always catholic in their choice of covers, but an unexpected, desolate version of traditional folksong In the Pines is the most extraordinary, largely because of Cobain\u2019s vocal, which begins as a faltering mumble and ends up operating at a level of emotional intensity that\u2019s just shy of unbearable. 6. Aneurysm (1991) Bafflingly relegated to B-side status, Aneurysm is every bit the equal of anything on Nevermind: a lyric that could be about blooming love or blossoming addiction, set to ferocious drumming and walls of noisy guitar, the harmony vocals on the coda fighting against the ongoing din. The live version from 1992\u2019s Reading festival is particularly fraught and gripping. 5. Sliver (1990) Nirvana\u2019s improbable rise in a nutshell. Sliver was the first track that really pointed the way to Nevermind, a gleeful retelling of a childhood visit to Cobain\u2019s grandparents in which throat-shredding vocals meet a glorious tune and Nirvana\u2019s celebrated, Pixies-inspired quiet/loud dynamic. But it was meant as a joke, a \u201cridiculous pop song\u201d recorded in an hour during labelmates Tad\u2019s lunch break. 4. In Bloom (1991) The success of Nevermind made the lyrics of In Bloom seem weirdly and entirely unintentionally prescient: meant as a portrait of Cobain\u2019s friend Dylan Carlson, it ended up sounding like a howl of disgust at the more lumpen elements in Nirvana\u2019s new audience. The chorus, meanwhile, is the perfect example of Cobain\u2019s ability to conjure a simple but indelible melody. 3. Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) Overfamiliarity means it is hard to remember what an impact Teen Spirit had on release. In an era when major labels, big budgets and the quest for mainstream success almost invariably blunted an indie band\u2019s power, Nirvana, incredibly, seemed to have been vastly potentiated by the move, honing their sound and their songwriting without losing their individuality. Plus they had come up with one of the all-time great riffs. 2. All Apologies (1993) A heartbreaking counterpoint to the anguish and noise elsewhere on In Utero, All Apologies was written in 1990, but tellingly exhumed after Nirvana hit big. It feels acquiescent, defeated, the sound of a man crushed by fame. There\u2019s no getting around the fact the lyrics read like a suicide note \u2013 \u201ceverything\u2019s my fault\u201d \u2013 although there is also a faint suggestion of a happier ending: \u201cIn the sun I feel as one.\u201d 1. Heart-Shaped Box (1993) In Utero is an album whose reputation precedes it: an unsettling farewell note from a doomed man at the end of his tether; a noisy, wilfully unpalatable screw-you to anyone who wanted Nevermind II, Nirvana\u2019s horrified record company included. Those interpretations tend to overshadow the fact that it also represented a genuine musical progression. Heart-Shaped Box not only boasted one of Cobain\u2019s most haunting melodies, and some of his most disturbing lyrics \u2013 for some reason, its famous declaration of love, \u201cI wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\u201d, has yet to be co-opted by the makers of Valentine cards \u2013 but also developed the band\u2019s trademark dynamic shifts: gradually ratcheting up the tension in the verses before the chorus explodes into jagged shards; nearly collapsing altogether after the guitar solo. Thrilling, white-knuckle listening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
