The ruling came days after a prominent bishop from another evangelical church told followers not to worry about the pandemic because the devil was trying to create fear. Religious leaders around the world have closed places of worship to help slow the spread of the virus, but many evangelical and Catholic churches remain open in Brazil, where seven people have died from Covid-19 and there are 654 confirmed cases. Even before Thursday\u2019s court ruling, Pastor Silas Malafia, head of the Assembly of God Victory in Christ church \u2013 and a vociferous ally of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 said his church would stay open. \u201cIf everything closes, there will be a little door open in my church and I will be there,\u201d Malafia said in a video on Thursday. Bolsonaro, who recently dismissed coronavirus as a media \u201cfantasy\u201d, has provoked widespread condemnation by defying medical advice and making public appearances with crowds of supporters. \u201cWe have to to reduce the circulation of people \u2013 and even more so in closed environments \u2013 to reduce the spread of the virus,\u201d said Ralycon Teixeira, an infectious diseases specialist at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Em\u00edlio Ribas hospital. In an Instagram video, gospel singer Ana Paula Valad\u00e3o attacked churches for staying open and suggested they wanted to keep receiving donations from the faithful. Malafia responded by saying his church took donations online. More than 1,500 people attended a service at Malafia\u2019s huge church in Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday said Alexandre Camargo, a pastor at the church. \u201cIt is a spiritual hospital for us,\u201d he said. The church is not filled to capacity, hand sanitizer is provided and worshippers stay more than one metre apart, he said. The Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo has taken a similar stance but masses there have been reduced. With public worship banned in Italy, Pope Francis has been broadcasting mass online. Brazil\u2019s biggest evangelical church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, is also still holding services, (and providing soap and water and hand sanitizer, telling people to keep their distance and avoiding prayers involving physical contact). Its leader, Bishop Edir Macedo, told followers not to worry about coronavirus in a WhatsApp video. \u201cThere is an economic interest behind this whole coronavirus campaign,\u201d he said, claiming a campaign of fear had been created by the devil. \u201cSatan works with fear,\u201d Macedo said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
