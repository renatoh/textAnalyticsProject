In the face of such a wealth of possibilities, and the knowledge that one mistake could be enough to put any of them out of the running, it is no surprise that bookmakers and backers alike place a premium on proven form over these obstacles and Chance Du Roy, the winner here 12 months ago off a mark of 135, has been a popular choice in the early exchanges. He is only 6lb higher in the ratings now for a length defeat of the 13-year-old Baby Run last season, when Mr Moonshine, who faces him again on Saturday, was another length and three quarters away in third. Mr Moonshine is 7lb worse off this time, which further underlines the strength of Chance Du Roy\u2019s claims, but this is a much more competitive event all round and it could pay to look to the younger generation for a chaser who is ready to step up to this challenge. Mendip Express, whose trainer, Harry Fry, could be described as \u201cin form\u201d were it not for the fact that he never seems to be anything else, is one possibility, though his failure to complete due to bleeding in the Scottish Grand National last season is a concern. Balbriggan (1.30), on the other hand, put up the best run of his career in the Troytown Chase last time out, when he was backed down to start favourite at 4-1, and, while he is 10lb higher in the ratings here, he would have won more comfortably but for a couple of late errors. A front-running style can be very effective over this circuit and he is worth backing at around 11-1. Sandown 1.50 There are only four runners for the first of the Grade One events but there is only 4lb between them according to Timeform\u2019s ratings and every likelihood of a tightly fought and fascinating race. Irish Saint was a good third off a mark of 145 in the Betfair Hurdle last February but Court Minstrel\u2019s hurdles form culminated in a win off 147 at the Aintree Festival in April and a close second in the Scottish Champion Hurdle under a 5lb penalty, and he retains plenty of scope for further improvement over fences. Aintree 2.05 This another difficult puzzle with a long list of possible winners but Nexius is improving rapidly, acts on this ground and looked to have more to offer when successful off 120 at Musselburgh last month. He is 8lb higher here but it should not be beyond him. Sandown 2.25 This may not be quite the race it was back in the 1980s, when it was the feature event on the card and numbered the subsequent Champion Hurdler Celtic Shot among its winners, but few can be written off entirely. Snake Eyes, unraced since finishing sixth in a very competitive race at Leopardstown in January, catches the eye off a 2lb lower mark with Tony McCoy in the saddle for JP McManus and, while his absence since is a concern, Nicky Henderson\u2019s string is starting to find its form. A big run is a distinct possibility. Aintree 2.40 This is another example of a four-runner race that is far more competitive than it might seem at first glance. Again, all four go to post with a genuine chance but Holywell has a Grade One win over course and distance last April in his recent form and should find enough improvement from his seasonal debut behind the subsequent Hennessy winner Many Clouds to come out on top. Sandown 3.00 Balder Succes has finished behind God\u2019s Own on his last two outings but he is 7lb better off for a five-length defeat in the Haldon Gold Cup and has less than a length to find on their running in the Grade One Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown in May, when Balder Success was up with the pace throughout and a easy target for the fast-finishing God\u2019s Own. A more measured ride on Saturday should see him turn the tables and Vukovar could be his biggest danger. Harry Fry does not make fanciful entries for his horses and it will be fascinating to see how the five-year-old gets on as he makes only his fourth start over British fences. Aintree 3.15 Another big field tackles the Grand National fences and, while 15 is a more manageable number than 25, they will be going that little bit faster over this extended two miles and five furlongs. Last year\u2019s winner, Rebel Rebellion, has not found his best form this season, and Persian Snow, who was second off 137 at Cheltenham in October before a below-par run in the Paddy Power Gold Cup, could continue the excellent run of the Philip Hobbs stable. Sandown 3.35 Whats Happening is a tentative selection in another tight race. Tom George\u2019s seven-year-old was only fourth on his season debut at Bangor last month but should come on for the run and looks the sort to improve for the step up to a marathon trip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
