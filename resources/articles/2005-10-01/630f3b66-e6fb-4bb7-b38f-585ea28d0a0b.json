It not only tackles immediate symptoms, but allows people to look at their whole lifestyle, so they can take responsibility for their own health and remain healthy,\" says Susan Thorne, who has been a licensed acupuncturist for 13 years. Acupuncture is increasingly being accepted into the medical mainstream, with GPs referring their patients to accredited practitioners, many of whom have come to the profession from other careers. Thorne was a vision mixer at the BBC. By the late 1980s, she had grown tired of the \"men in grey suits\" culture that had emerged, as well as the awkward hours. She did Tai Chi to reduce \"stress levels\". But it was after being treated for an intestinal parasite, picked up while travelling, that she decided to train as an acupuncturist. \"Western medicine cleared my gut of giardia but left me feeling washed out,\" says Thorne. \"A course of acupuncture helped me, but I became aware it was also doing something else - something indefinable. I was less stressed and had a more positive outlook on life.\" It is through these kinds of personal experiences that many people become acupuncturists, says Persis Tamboly at the British Acupuncture Council. The BAcC is the UK's main regulatory body for acupuncture and represents more than 2,500 professionally qualified acupuncturists, including Thorne, who sits on its executive. Acpuncture is not governed by legislation in the UK, though the Department of Health says that will change by 2008. In the meantime, the BAcC recommends at least a three-year full-time course, or part-time equivalent, at one of the seven colleges accredited by the British Acupuncture Accreditation Board. The BAAP also has an accreditation process for those who may have trained and practised in China, for example. Thorne did a weekend course over three years at Leamington Spa. At the time there were only a few courses, each teaching from a different standpoint. \"Now there is a common core curriculum,\" she says. After getting her licentiate in acupuncture, she worked in Daventry as a locum for an acupuncturist for whom she had interned as part of her training. \"This was the most unbelievable opportunity. I also fell in love with the countryside.\" Thorne now runs her own part-time practice from her home just outside Guildford. \"I am able to control my own time, it's interesting work and you are learning all the time,\" she says. \"Television was a very 'young person' industry where new ideas from new people are held in higher regard than experience. \"In this mode of medicine, experience and knowledge gained over time is highly valued. Each patient adds to the knowledge base and I'm learning all the time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
