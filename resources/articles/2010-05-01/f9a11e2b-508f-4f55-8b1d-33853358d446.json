They are the Benades: Treppie (Lionel Newton), a fridge repairman who lives with his sister, her husband and their son Lambert, who has learning disabilities. They are a violent, incestuous and repellently racist bunch. Set in the run-up to the historic 1994 elections, the Benades' paranoia about the end of apartheid coincides with a catastrophic family meltdown. The acting is faultless, but Triomf's tone is oil and water: sadistic black comedy poured on to operatic Oedipal tragedy, with decidedly questionable results. A scene in which 20-year-old Lambert is having sex with his worn-out submissive mother is played for laughs, a pet dog rutting at his leg. Had I not been reviewing, I would have walked out right there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
