The Liverpool defender had been on a high when he reported for duty on Monday morning, hard on the heels of his club\u2019s 3-1 win over Manchester City which moved them eight points clear at the top of the Premier League. He has since been hit by a series of blows which, according to Gareth Southgate, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t make up if you tried\u201d. First, there was the well-documented bust-up at St George\u2019s Park with Raheem Sterling, which led to Gomez being cut under the eye and Sterling discarded for Thursday\u2019s 7-0 Wembley win over Montenegro, with which England secured their qualification to the finals. Gomez was introduced as a 70th-minute substitute but he was left distraught when a section of the home crowd booed him. Sterling would tweet in support of him afterwards. Then, on Friday, as Gomez tried to defend a ball in training with Trippier, who was playing on the same team, and banged knees with him. Following a scan, the decision was taken to omit him from the party that travelled to Kosovo. \u201cWe actually ended up having a chuckle this morning at the ridiculousness of it \u2013 of him having to go home in the way that he did,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult week but one that will make him stronger and one that he\u2019s dealt with really well. \u201cThe injury was him and Kieran Trippier \u2013 they were trying to defend a ball, actually both on the same team \u2013 they collided into each other. Joe felt restricted in the last part of the session. We scanned it just to be certain and I think he\u2019ll be fine in a couple of days but he wasn\u2019t able to train today. \u201cI think now is a good moment for him just to go home for a couple of days, clear his head. The pleasing thing for me is that we\u2019ve got him back on the pitch [against Montenegro]. The fact that Raheem put out the tweet was real closure on that whole incident. We get Raheem back on the pitch tomorrow. We won the match on Thursday and we can now just look forwards.\u201d England have been welcomed warmly in Kosovo, given the history of how British troops helped the country to gain independence from Serbia. There was a lighthearted moment in the press conference on Saturday night when a local reporter asked whether, in light of the reception that Southgate and his players are expected to receive at the game, it would be ironic if the travelling English fans booed Sterling. Except that it was translated as the travelling \u201cFrench\u201d fans. \u201cThat would be ironic, yes,\u201d Southgate said, to laughter. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the most ludicrous part of this week but that would be ironic.\u201d Southgate reported that James Maddison was a doubt with a calf problem while he does not want to overload John Stones after the amount of football he has played since returning from injury. The manager also noted that the seeding for the finals could be important, so a good result against Kosovo was equally so. Southgate sounded an optimistic note about his young team. \u201cFrance won the World Cup with an average age of 25 and I think they were the second or third youngest squad alongside ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible [to win with a young side]. \u201cOver the years we\u2019ve had players where the shirt has hung heavy and the performances have reflected that. We have a young team who really play with freedom and expression, thinking about what\u2019s possible on the field rather than worrying about losing the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
