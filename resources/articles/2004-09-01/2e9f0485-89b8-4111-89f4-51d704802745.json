Watford dominated much of an entertaining match, creating a string of chances with an adroitness equalled only by their capacity to waste them. Ashley Young will be feeling more guilty than most, having volleyed Neal Ardley's late corner high and wide with the outside of his right boot when a goal seemed inevitable. \"I thought they were better than us; they had more desire than us,\" the Wigan manager Paul Jewell admitted afterwards. \"We're fortunate to come away with the draw. I'm disappointed with the performance and I've told the players that. Perhaps they're getting a bit complacent. It's a small squad and we've got to do something about it. If I don't see an improvement I won't be frightened to spend money. I'm not happy.\" If Jewell's words hinted at a crisis it is not one reflected in the league table, which shows his side with the division's last unbeaten record. Yet this was Wigan's fourth consecutive away draw, their much-vaunted forwards Nathan Ellington and Jason Roberts blunted by the league's most parsimonious defence. But they too might have stolen the points, having come close to breaking the deadlock three times in the second half. Ellington was twice denied by Richard Lee in the Watford goal, the first save the finest of the match, the young keeper flinging out an arm after Ellington met Jimmy Bullard's corner with a powerful header. Lee's handling was less impressive when Alan Mahon shot from outside the area, but Roberts sent the rebound over from eight yards. As in their defeat to Reading on Saturday, Watford's near-misses were too numerous to mention, but Danny Webber missed their best opportunity of the first half after Ardley had sent him clear, and Young will still be hanging his head this morning.\"It was a really good display,\" their manager Ray Lewington said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
