Asked to tell the jury how he felt about the events of Sunday August 4 last year, when the girls died, he said: \"I wish I could turn back the clock, I wish I could do things differently, I just wish none of this had ever happened. \"I'm sorry for what's happened, I'm ashamed of what I did. I accept I'm responsible for the deaths of Holly and Jessica but there's nothing I can do about it now ... I sincerely wish there was.\" Mr Huntley, 29, also said he had deliberately destroyed evidence linking the Soham schoolgirls to his home and car after they died accidentally in his bathroom on Sunday August 4 last year. Giving evidence for the first time today, after the prosecution finished its evidence against him, the former Soham Village college caretaker said: \"I wanted to tell somebody [what had happened to the girls]. I tried on several occasions to tell Maxine [Carr, his then girlfriend] but I couldn't get the words out. \"How do you tell somebody that you are responsible for the deaths of two girls and then what happened after that?\" Mr Huntley denies murdering the two 10-year-olds. He has admitted one charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Ms Carr, 26, denies two counts of assisting an offender and one of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The prosecution alleges she gave Mr Huntley a false alibi for the night the girls vanished. The school caretaker earlier said that he \"panicked and froze\" after the girls died in his bathroom at 5 College Close. He said that he did not then call the police or an ambulance because he \"could not believe\" how events had unfolded. \"I kept thinking 'How do I explain this to the police?' ... If you can't believe what has happened yourself, how are you going to expect the police to believe it either?\" Huntley: how I disposed of the girls' bodies Mr Huntley told the court how, after the accident in the bathroom, he put the girls' fully clothed bodies into the boot of his red Ford Fiesta and drove away from Soham. He repeatedly insisted that he had no plan at that stage, but found himself driving towards Lakenheath in Suffolk, where his grandmother lived. Mr Huntley said he took two black bin liners and a petrol can with him in the car. When asked by his defence counsel, Stephen Coward QC, what the petrol can was for, he replied: \"To destroy any evidence.\" Mr Huntley said he was not sure of the time when he loaded the girls' bodies into his car, but that when he arrived at Common Drove, the deposition site near Lakenheath, it was around 9pm. He told the jury that he rolled the girls' bodies, one by one, down a ditch. He said he then decided to remove the girls' clothes because he realised \"they would not burn\" and that they had fibres from his boot carpet on them. Mr Huntley then described cutting off the girls' clothes with a pair of scissors, which he said were already in the car, but denied touching the girls in any sexual way. He then put the clothes into the bin liners and poured petrol over the girls' bodies. He then lit the petrol but could not say how long the blaze lasted, saying only: \"I know it flared. I put the petrol can back in the front passenger side of the car and the clothing in the boot of the car and drove away as quickly as I could from there.\" Mr Huntley disposed of the girls' clothes and Jessica's mobile phone in a skip outside the school, burning the bag of clothes with petrol \"for a few minutes\". When asked why he had tried to dispose of the clothing at the college, Mr Huntley replied: \"I'm not really sure ... I do not think there is much in the way of rational thinking going on.\" Mr Huntley described encountering several people later on that evening, who were searching for the girls on the streets of Soham. Explaining why he lied to them, he said: \"I had let things go too far. I did not know what I would say to people ... I was frightened and ashamed of what I had done.\" Huntley: how the girls died Earlier the court heard Mr Huntley describe in his own words the accident which he says led to Holly and Jessica dying in his bathroom. Mr Huntley said he had invited the schoolgirls into his Cambridgeshire home at around 6.40 on the Sunday evening, because Holly had a nosebleed. The girls had been walking past while he brushed his dog, Sadie, on the doorstep of his home and stopped to ask after Ms Carr, who had been their teaching assistant. Mr Huntley had earlier told the court that Ms Carr was in Grimsby at the time, visiting her family. While in the bathroom, Mr Huntley said he accidentally knocked Holly into the bath, which he had earlier partially filled with around six to eight inches of water, to wash his dog. Mr Huntley said: \"I went to pass Holly some more tissues... As I did - I am not really sure how it happened - I sort of turned and I slipped and went forward in the direction of Holly. \"When Holly fell into the bath, I was stood there waiting for some movement or for her to get up ... there was no movement.\" The accused told the jury: \"If I had pulled Holly out of the bath and got her to regain consciousness, everything would have been OK.\" When asked by trial judge Mr Justice Moses if he could say why he had slipped, the witness replied: \"No. I don't know.\" Mr Huntley said he heard a \"splash\" as Holly began to fall backwards. The next sound he remembered was Jessica screaming, he continued. \"She was screaming and shouting at me, 'You pushed her', over and over,\" he said. Mr Huntley had not pushed her into the bath purposely, he said. Asked what effect Jessica's screaming had had on him, Mr Huntley said: \"I couldn't think. Stood here it's logical just to pull somebody out of the bath, especially when they are not moving. I could not think.\" He said he remembered putting at least one hand, if not both, over Jessica's mouth to stop her screaming and to \"restrain\" her. Then, he said, it suddenly hit him that he should pull Holly from the bathwater but when he released Jessica, she immediately fell to the floor. He said it \"didn't really register\" why Jessica had fallen, as \"my main priority now was to get Holly out of the bath\". Mr Huntley then said he checked both girls for pulses and could not find any. He said he then \"sat in the corner on the landing just looking at Jessica\". He told the jury he did not know how long he remained there, but then realised he had been sick on the carpet. He did not try to resuscitate the girls and \"things were not clear in his head\", he said. Mr Huntley said he began to \"regret\" not calling the police or any other emergency services in the early hours of Monday morning. Huntley: I never told Maxine what happened When cross-examined by prosecution counsel Michael Hubbard QC, Mr Huntley denied that he had asked Ms Carr to provide an alibi for him, saying he \"did not put the idea forward to Maxine\". Ms Carr had said she wanted to return home immediately after Mr Huntley told her in a phone call on Monday that the missing girls were Holly and Jessica, he said. After she returned to Soham, Mr Huntley said, he admitted no more to Ms Carr than that the girls came into the house because of Holly's nosebleed, then left again, he said. The accused said he told Ms Carr he \"didn't know which way to turn\" and was in obvious distress at the prospect of being a police suspect. So Ms Carr outlined an alibi saying that she had been at home in Soham on August 4, which Mr Huntley wrote down on a piece of paper, he said. Mr Huntley said he had been reluctant to appear in television coverage of the missing schoolgirls because he feared someone in Grimsby would recognise him as a man who was charged with rape there in 1998. But he eventually ended up agreeing to be interviewed, he said, and admitted lying to the media. When asked by his lawyer what this was like, Mr Huntley replied: \"I was falling to pieces inside, it was very difficult.\" Mr Huntley told the jury he considered suicide in the days after the girls' deaths, \"because ... it's been very difficult to live with what's happened and I couldn't get the words out to tell anybody ... I guess you could probably call me a coward, that was what I am. Every time I tried to tell Maxine, I couldn't do it.\" Prosecution rests case Prior to Mr Huntley taking the stand, on day 20 of the case, the prosecutor Richard Latham QC completed the prosecution case, which alleges that Mr Huntley murdered Holly and Jessica on August 4 2002. The court heard that there was no evidence of Holly or Jessica having been sedated prior to their deaths and that no hairs, blood or fingerprints from Holly and Jessica - save those which were found on a box of chocolates that the girls had given to Ms Carr - had been found in Mr Huntley's home. Neither had any of the girls' hair, blood or fingerprints been recovered from the accused's Ford Fiesta, the prosecution said. The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
