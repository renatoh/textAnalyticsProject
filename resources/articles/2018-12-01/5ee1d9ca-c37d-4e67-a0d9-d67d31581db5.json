Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he would bring the First Step Act for a vote as early as the end of the week. The bill reportedly has enough votes to defeat a filibuster and pass, but McConnell, who has total control over what votes get scheduled, had been wavering until his Tuesday announcement. He may have finally come off the fence after pressure from Trump who, during a White House meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, said it \u201clooks like it is going to be passing\u201d and in a \u201cvery bipartisan way\u201d. The act, which applies to federal prisoners only, would expand rehabilitative opportunities, reduce mandatory minimum sentences for a number of drug-related crimes, and ban some of the most startling correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women. Jessica Jackson-Sloan, the national director for reform advocacy group Cut50, lamented the bill\u2019s rightward swing in order to placate conservatives but celebrated that \u201cthis is still the most substantial rewrite of the nation\u2019s sentencing and prison reform laws that has happened in decades\u201d. First Step passed the House in May as a prison reform bill that did not contain any language to reduce sentencing length \u2013 which was considered politically toxic to many House Republicans. Prominent Senate lawmakers from both parties saw sentencing reform as critical to any criminal justice reform package, however. Led by the judiciary committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, Senate lawmakers worked over the ensuing months to draft a version that could include sentencing reform without alienating Trump or Republican supporters. If it passes the Senate, the new version of the bill would return to the House for approval, but speaker Paul Ryan said \u201cthe House stands ready to get it done\u201d, in a statement on Tuesday, indicating he would make a vote a priority in the limited time that remains in the congressional session. In the negotiation process a number of concessions were made to secure support from conservative groups and lawmakers like the Fraternal Order of Police and Texas Senator Ted Cruz who have both come out in favor of the bill in the last month. One that concerns Jackson-Sloan the most is exclusions which restrict prisoners who have committed the most serious crimes from receiving some of the supports outlined by the bill, a move she called \u201cstupid\u201d. \u201cYou want people who have committed the worst crimes to be the ones getting the most rehabilitation,\u201d said Jackson-Sloan. Still, she believes the bill will have a \u201ctrickle down justice impact\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve already gotten legislators from the south and the midwest, calling us and asking how to do the first step in their state so we\u2019re hoping we take this this show on the road.\u201d About 90% of incarcerated people in the US are held not in federal custody, but by state and local corrections systems. The ACLU, which had initially opposed the House version of the legislation also signaled its support on Tuesday. \u201cAmerica is in the midst of a mass incarceration crisis, and the passage of this bill will help send an important message to the rest of the country about the urgency of addressing that crisis,\u201d said Jesselyn McCurdy, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Washington Legislative Office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
