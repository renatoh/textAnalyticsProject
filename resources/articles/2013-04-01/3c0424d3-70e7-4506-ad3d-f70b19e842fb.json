Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the government rejected advice from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), regarding the lessons to be learned following Japan's Fukushima disaster. The regulator recommended restricting development near nuclear plants, advice that was overridden last week when the government approved the expansion of Lydd airport in Kent, a couple of miles from Dungeness nuclear power station. Mike Weightman, HM chief inspector for nuclear installations, wrote a report for the government about the lessons to be learned from the Japanese meltdown, which said: \"In light of the events at Fukushima, we consider that it is timely for the relevant government departments in the UK to examine the existing system of planning controls for developments in the vicinity of nuclear sites and consider the need for improvements.\" Weightman felt that the current planning control system did not go far enough. His argument was then backed by the ONR, which recommended to the Department for Energy and Climate Change that there should be \"a review of the adequacy of planning controls governing the construction of residential and commercial developments near nuclear power plants\". The regulator demanded that the constraints should be incorporated into the National Planning Policy Framework, the government's new overarching document which determines development and has proved controversial with some heritage and environmental groups because of what they perceive to be its \"pro-build\" ethos. The ONR also sought \"statutory consultee status\" so that its regulatory advice would be given more weight in planning matters, and even wrote to the Department for Communities and Local Government calling for national planning policy to treat safety and security developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities similar to flood risks. The regulator was determined to check future house-building and commerical expansion near nuclear plants. In 2010, the ONR had outlined the case against the building of new homes next to Aldermaston atomic energy facility, only for the secretary of state, Eric Pickles, to reject its objections. In a letter to DCLG, obtained by the Observer, the ONR explained that the Aldermaston case \"highlighted the fact that nuclear administrative arrangements for developments around nuclear installations have not been modernised and incorporated into the current national spatial planning framework. This means that appropriate weight is not given to nuclear safety and security concerns in the planning balance\". The regulator was clearly alarmed that the government's draft planning framework document failed to reflect its views. The ONR's letter explains \"the draft framework document makes no mention of any constraint to developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities, nor indeed other high hazard facilities \u2026 While we recognise and accept the reasoning behind the government's policy presumption in favour of positive planning decisions, for these to be sustainable it is important to ensure that we do not undermine other important government policies, such as the need to control developments around nuclear installations that are designed to ensure that people and society are properly protected.\" But the energy department rejected the thrust of the regulation office's demands. Instead, the NPPF stated only that planning policies should be \"based on up-to-date information on the location of major hazards\" and that \"local planning authorities should consult the appropriate bodies when planning\". Documents released under freedom of information reveal the ONR's increasing alarm that its demands were being ignored as the framework was developed. In an email in December 2011, an ONR official asks his counterpart in the Office for Nuclear Development, part of the energy department, \"if there is any pressure you can apply in order to get us a meeting with DCLG?\" Louise Barton, of Lydd Airport Action Group, described the failure to rein in development near nuclear facilities as \"reprehensible\". She said: \"The recommendation was made to save lives. What right has Mr Pickles to sacrifice public safety for the sake of growth?\" A department spokeswoman said the letter of October 2011 had raised issues that had been addressed. \"For the first time the framework brings the requirements for local councils to work with the Office for Nuclear Regulation into one place,\" she said. \"This ensures that the presence of a nuclear installation is taken into account in all planning policy decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
