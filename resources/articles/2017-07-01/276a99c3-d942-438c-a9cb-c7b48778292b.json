It was an afternoon of sustained emotions but scant drama. Federer, a great Wimbledon favourite since winning his first title in 2003, raced through the match in one hour and 41 minutes and dropped only eight games in a 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 procession. This victory meant the Swiss master, who turns 36 next month, surpassed the big-serving American \u201cPistol\u201d Pete Sampras and the Victorian-era great, William Renshaw, who claimed seven. Federer also became the first man to win Wimbledon without dropping a set since Bjorn Borg in 1976. \u201cIt is very special to win eight titles,\u201d Federer said. \u201cWimbledon was always my favourite tournament, and will always be my favourite tournament. My heroes walked the grounds here. Because of them I think I became a better player, too. And No8 obviously means a lot to me because to be part of Wimbledon history is truly amazing.\u201d What made this victory more remarkable still was that the era when Federer\u2019s racket played like a Stradivarius, and the American writer David Foster Wallace compared watching him to a religious experience, had appeared over for good last year. He was approaching his 35th birthday. He had not won a grand slam since 2012. And, worse still, he was struggling with a knee injury \u2013 sustained whilst running a bath for his twin daughters \u2013 which forced him out of the game for five months. But the thousands walking along Church Road to the All England club for the final on Sunday understood that the Federer of 2017 was a player miraculously reborn, having won the Australian Open in January and 32 of his 34 matches this year. And so it proved as he dismissed a hobbling Cilic with minimal fuss. It was not supposed to be that easy given the 6ft 6in Cilic was in the form of his life. Few knew, however, that he had a huge blister on his foot after his semi-final against Sam Querrey. It meant that every time he made a sudden movement it felt like an electric shock up his leg. Understandably it screwed up his mind \u2013 and his groundstrokes. \u201cI tried to block my thoughts,\u201d the Croatian said. \u201cI tried to block the pain. But even in the warmup I was testing my movement going side to side and I was too slow.\u201d That was evident in his play, with Cilic clanking 23 unforced errors compared to only 16 winners. Federer did not initially sense anything was wrong with the giant across the net. Even though it was his 11th Wimbledon final it could have been the first given his early nerves. He served two fidgety double faults in the opening two games and also faced break point at 2-2. The 15,000 spectators inside Centre Court held their breath. Yet Federer survived and in the next game broke his opponent before running away with the first set. Cilic\u2019s movement was increasingly tortured, and at 3-0 down in the second set he called for the trainer, who bandaged him up. It did little good. In a blur he was two sets down and staring into the abyss. As the third set began, and the clouds were finally burnt off by the sun, the Croat tried to mix things up by serving and volleying. But such was the whip and dip in Federer\u2019s backhand return he was having to play his volleys off his bootlaces. At this point there was only going to be one winner. By the time Cilic found himself breakpoint down at 3-3 the strained cries of \u201cC\u2019mon Marin!\u201d were growing in number and intensity. Most of the crowd probably still wanted Federer to win but they also wanted more tennis. He was in no mood to oblige. A decisive break soon arrived, along with this most precious of victories. Afterwards he repeatedly waved at his four children, three of whom were sat on the balcony above the NBC TV studio transfixed by the applause for their father. They were surely not the only ones. Thousands of teenagers watching on Sunday would not have been born in 2003 when Federer beat Mark Philippoussis to claim his first title. The good news for us \u2013 if not his rivals \u2013 is that Federer intends to be back again in 2018. \u201cI still love to play and my wife\u2019s totally fine with it,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cShe\u2019s my No1 supporter. She\u2019s amazing. And because I\u2019m playing a little less, I feel like I\u2019m working part-time these days, which is a great feeling.\u201d The tennis gods have been kind to Federer at Wimbledon this year. Andy Murray hobbled out with a hip problem. Novak Djokovic was given the elbow by an inflamed joint. And Rafael Nadal was sunk by a 34-year-old Luxemburger, Gilles Muller, who suddenly played the best tennis of his career. But on the evidence of this fortnight Federer would have been tough to topple whoever was on the other side of the net. While this was his 19th grand slam victory, another record, few would bet against more coming his way. For even now, in the autumn of his career, he stands tallest of all.
