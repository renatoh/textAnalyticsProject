The all-share deal follows weeks of speculation over the future of Blue Square, with several US based gaming giants also understood to be interested in the dotcom. The site, established in 1999, has around 113,000 regular customers and will significantly boost Rank's online operations, which have failed to generate the expected number of players. The combined operation will have a turnover of \u00a3400m a year from 129,000 regular users. Rank said that it planned to save around \u00a35m per year through merging the Blue Square site with its existing operations and there are expected to be a small number of redundancies. The merged site will offer a combination of sports betting through Blue Square and Rank's existing online casino and bingo games. \"The transaction fulfils a clear and stated strategic aim to add betting products and expertise to our existing gaming activities, which already represent the largest part of the group,\" said Rank chief executive Mike Smith in a statement. While it has grown rapidly since its launch in 1999, boosted by widespread marketing campaigns and public relations stunts such as offering betting on turkey and snail racing, Blue Square has found it increasingly difficult to compete with the online arms of the big high street bookmakers. The group hopes that by building a full range of gaming products such as betting, bingo and casino games for use in new multigaming locations, it will be well placed to gain from the coming deregulation of the UK gaming industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
