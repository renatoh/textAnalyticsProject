Reg, a Dub in Sydney writes to say: \"Half nine in the morning on - thank Crunchie it's - Friday. I can' help but wonder if the central defence pairing of Woodgate &amp; Duberry is to the detriment of Leeds, given that both players surely won't have warm feelings for each other anymore. Also, you're probably aware that Kewell &amp; Viduka don't particularly like each other (allegedly). So, are there any other famous team mates who'd happily pee in each others boots?\" I could tell you Reg, except I don't know. Shame you didn't go to work earlier and we could have let this one run and run. All I can tell you is that Woodgate was excellent in the Leeds defence tonight, and I did see him talking to Duberry on at least two occasions. They were probably discussing the finer points of Gordon Brown's pre-budget speech from yesterday. Anyway, it's 0-0 after the first leg which, going on Leeds' current form, has to be considered a major triumph for Terry Venables. Thanks for your e-mails and goodnight. Final word goes to Patrick Downey, who unlike many of our subscribers (yes you, Tony O'Brien), seems to have a vague idea of what he's on about: \"I just tuned in here in Canada and read the commentary,\" he says. \"My take on the Batty issue is that he was holding a grudge because he wasn't picked for Euro 96 (allegedly), decided to show El Tel what for by not participating in the pre-season trip (allegedly), and is now warming his bum at El Tel's pleasure. \"I think Batty is still an asset, and would have really helped in some crucial situations this season. He is also a great influence on Smith, keeping him calm as Mr. Batty has been through it all.\" 88 mins: After the grimmest 25 minutes of football I've ever had to sit through, Ian Harte does his best to win it for Malaga by very nearly chesting a cross into his own net. He owes his alert goalkeeper a pint in the players' lounge afterwards. 85 mins: Woodgate flicks it away under pressure from Edgar - a vital clearance. \"Is Celebrity Big Brother a pile of old cack or is it a testament to modern society and our highly evolved intelligence?\" enquires Daniel Kelleher. It's nonsense Daniel. End of story. And I'm not entering into a debate on this one. Suffice to say, if everyone stopped watching it, it would go away. \"The photo of Alan Smith is cut off at the top,\" observes David Keogh, giving the impression that he's about to unleash a comedic zinger. \"Which defender's severed head is he holding?\" 83 mins: Michael Duberry concedes a corner from a good cross. Malaga sent it in and, not for the first time, fail to get it past Smith at the near post. Lamentable set-piece-ery. Lamentable. 80 mins: I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that neither of these teams have a hope of winning the Uefa Cup. Tony O'Brien, meanwhile, owes me NZ$10, as Alan Smith hasn't been sent off and we're long past the 60-minute mark. Dely Valdez beats Woodgate in the air and brings a very smart save out of an alert Paul Robinson. It was a good, firm header. 77 mins: Robert Truelove has asked me to stop slagging off England's best striker. I have no idea why, because I have not mentioned Michael Owen once in this report so far. Musampa tackles Lee Bowyer and the Leeds midfielder limps away very gingerly. Malaga get the free-kick, Masumpa - who is useless, incidentally - takes it and it's cleared by Woodgate, who is playing a blinder. 75 mins: The substitute, Edgar, beats Harte for pace (doesn't everyone?) and shoots across the face of the Leeds goal. Wide. 73 mins: The match has descended into farce recently. Neither team has had a decent effort on goal for 10 minutes or so now. It's all head tennis, misplaced passes and niggly fouls at the moment. 70 mins: You're missing nothing by the way - the game is a shambles. Hold on! McPhail, Wilcox and Woodgate start pushing and shoving several Malaga players after the Irishman was fouled by Sandro. The ref sorts it all out without reaching for his pocket. Far more importantly, I've found an appropriate picture of Alan Smith with an as yet unidentified female companion. See above. 68 mins: \"Great job as usual on the minute-by-minute,\" lies Lindsay Guyn, who seems completely oblivious that I'm having a Uefa Cup shocker. \"One suggestion though - it seems the most interesting sub-plot of an otherwise dull game is the Alan Smith Story. Could you get your research staff to dig up an array of Alan Smith faces from the archives (happy face, angry face, petulant face, etc.) and post them according to Alan's mood on the pitch? This would help set up some ambience for us office-bound types.\" My research staff? My research staff? You poor deluded fool Lindsay, what kind of organisation do you think we're running here? I'll see what i can do. Research staff indeed. 65 mins: Tony O'Brien obviously needs to get out more, as he's written in again. \"When you say there are 9 TV's in your house I begin to suspect you are some Terry McCann like sidekick to George Cole,\" he says. \"Alternatively, you live in a half way house in preparation for care in the community.\" Not being familiar with the number of televisions one could usually expect to find in half-way houses, I'll have to take your word that nine is standard, Tony. You strike meas the kind of chap who'd know these things. 63 mins: A good Sandro effort is deflected off Duberry. Malaga win a free to the left of the Leeds box when Bakke brings down Musampa. It's whipped in and Koke heads it narrowly wide. Terrible marking by the Leeds defence. 61 mins: Malaga take off their two wide men, Iznata and Manu, and replace them with Koke and Edgar. I'd have got rid of the two strikers myself. 60 mins: Dely Valdes pokes a ball into the path of the onrushing Musampa, whose low shot at goal is absolutely atrocious. Wide. 59 mins: Leeds are definitely bossing the game at the moment. 57 mins: McPahil finds Smith with a lovely long pass up the left wing. He does well to hold it up and eventually wins a free when a defender loses patience and trips him up. It may not have been pretty, but it was good play from he of the bleached barnet. Woodgate gets his head to the ensuing free-kick and loops it over the bar. 53 mins: \"Poor Barry,\" writes Neil Denton. \"Some of us have much more fun things to do in our bedrooms than watch TV. One day you'll understand, my son.\" Thanks for your pity, Neil, but I don't need it. Perhaps I should have explained what it is I watch on TV in my bedroom, with my harem. Bakke sends a low pass across the edge of the Malaga box and Kewell swings it at it. Rather comically, he misses it completely. Very poor. 51 mins: Bowyer finds Smith in the Malaga box with an excellent pass. Smith pulls out to the left to control it but his first touch is terrible. A good opportunity wasted. 49 mins: Malaga attack. It's very scrappy. \"I believe you have missed an opportunity to start a worldwide betting syndicate,\" writes Tony O'Brien. \"Therefore, to start the ball rolling I have NZ$10(GBP 3.30) that says Alan Smith won't last the hour before he's sent off.\" You're on, Tony. I reckon he'll last 60 minutes no problem and, even if he doesn't, the hilarity of seeing him get sent off again would be worth GBP\u00a33.30 of my money any day. 46 mins: A Sandro cross-field pass is intercepted by Wilcox, who gives it away. Malaga go forward and Musampa skins Gary Kelly (who is sporting a ridiculous looking goatee) and cuts it back to Dely Valdes. The ball goes just behind the big striker and he has to adjust his feet to get a shot in. Robinson gets down, saves well with one hand and Leeds hack it clear. 45 mins: Leeds kick off for the start of the second half. \"I just thought I'd email to muse idly on the irony that despite being in Barcelona I am unable to watch the game as Spanish TV is showing Real Betis v Auxerre,\" muses Rory Munro, idly. \"Sounds from your report like Leeds are matching this season's high points. By the way, can you shed any light on Venables' hatred of David Batty. When the one thing that everyone agrees on is that Leeds are missing a ball winner in midfield, why do you think we're starting with McPhail (with Burns on the bench forchrissakes!), while Batty doesn't even make the plane?\" Well Rory, it seems that Venables has never rated Batty (he didn't pick him for Euro 96) and even if he did, Batty injured himself recently and will be out until Christmas. I think. \"Is Kewell playing out on the left or in the middle?\" enquires Burt Bosma, who must be new. If he isn't he should know better than to ask me difficult football-related questions. \"If it's in the middle,\" he proclaims, \"Venables must go. Kewell on the left, Smith feeding off Viduka (where's he?) in the middle. It's not brain surgery, is it?\" Kewell is playing on the left, Burt, so Venables must stay. I have no idea where Viduka is. Off looking for a hot-dog or burger stand, I'd imagine. Half-time 45 mins: Josemi takes a super-long throw-in that Woodgate clears from the Leeds box. The referee blows for half-time. Not a terrible game, but not a good one either. Here's hoping the second half is a bit better. 41 mins: A Duberry foul results in Roteta hoisting a free-kick into the Leeds box. It's cleared. \"Sounds like you're enjoying the game Barry,\" says Chris Mason. \"Is it worth me bringing my TV upstairs and bothering to plug it in?\" I'd have to say no, Chris, although I'm slightly disturbed to learn that in the 21st century, there are people out there who don't have tellies in their bedrooms. There's nine televisions in my house. 38 mins: \"I just refuse to believe that Smith is ever the innocent party,\" says Richard Rouse, by way of explanation for his earlier cryptic remarks. \"Are you sure you didn't miss him starting the incident? As you may have guessed, I'm a firm believer in giving dogs bad names and stringing them up.\" The very suggestion that I would ever miss anything is hurtful, Richard. Watch as I observe Smith get a stern ticking off from the referee for another clumsy challenge. 34 mins: Musampa is put through on goal and blasts a brilliant opportunity over the Leeds crossbar. At the far end, Alan Smith and Malaga stopper Contreras go for a 50-50 ball and the goalkeeper comes out second best. Smith didn't touch the keeper, who is playing dead, but the Malaga players are surrounding the referee, imploring him to send off the Leeds striker. The ref's cards stay in his pocket. Correct decision. 31 mins: Alan Smith is up to his usual moronic nonsense. He gets fouled by a Malaga defender and wins a free. However, not content with winning a free, he has to get a little retaliatory cuff in and receives a yellow card for his troubles. Sanz starts laughing at him and Smith gesticulates back while telling him to \"F**k off!\" How often does he have to be sent off before he learns how to take a wind-up? 26 mins: The Malaga natives are getting restless. There's a bit of handbags involving Alan Smith (who else?) and several burly defenders, which is quickly sorted out by the referee. \"Perhaps it's time for the Guardian to invest in some new computers for you long suffering live reporters,\" writes Dave Livermore. \"It seems that every live report contains a reference to computer crashes/malfunctions etc. What are you using - Commodore 64s?\" Commodore 64s? Luxury! Mark Anderson, meanwhile, has sent me in some celebrity gossip. You're sending it to the wrong man, Mark. At the risk of sounding rude, might I suggest you send your footballers' wives-related tell-all to someone who gives a monkey's. Try Heat magazine - they'd probably pay top dollar for that kind of stuff. 23 mins: Lee Bowyer is brought down just outside the Malaga box. Himself and Ian Harte stand over the ball while Contreras assembles a wall. It does it's job as Harte sends the ball screaming into some poor unfortunate Spaniard's belly. 21 mins: A route one ball from Leeds, which Smith fails to win in the air. Lovely stuff. If only someone could capture it in watercolour. 18 mins: Richard Rouse has mailed in to accuse me of telling fibs by saying Alan Smith was fouled in the centre-circle. Either it's some sort of cryptic joke I don't get, or he's been drinking. Either way, I'm well and truly mystified. No change there, then. After some early Malaga pressure, Leeds have gone up a couple of gears. Manu fouls Ian Harte near the half-way line, although I'm prepared to stand corrected if Richard Rouse saw it differently. All my favourite pedants are out tonight. 15 mins: While I'm waiting for this heap of junk to save that last bit and deign to stick it up on your screens, Alan Smith has two good chances. He's put through and shoots straight at the on-rushing keeper from a narrow angle. Minutes later, Kewell whips in a low cross which Smith lunges at, but misses completely. All he had to do was get a toe to it and divert it into an empty net. 12 mins: Malaga win a corner which is booted into the box. Except it isn't really. Alan Smith heads it clear at the near post, the ball comes to Iznata just outside the Leeds box. He shoots and hits the sweet spot, but it's straight into Robinson's bread-basket. 11 mins: A ball is played through to Alan Smith from the back. Offside. 6 mins: The ever-critical Tony O'Brien is like a greyhound out of a trap with his two-cents worth: \"A bit slow off the mark today Barry,\" he observes. \"Presumably you will be blaming this on 'technical problems' rather than several pints of flat southern bitter.\" I wouldn't wash my feet with the stuff Tony, although i've a feleing i'll need a few pints of something strong by the end of this encounter. After 10 minutes, it's shaping up to be very bit as stimulating as I expected it would be. Yawn. 5 mins: Before everyone starts complaining about the glacier like speed of these updates, don't. My computer is taking aeons to save and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Not much has happened so far, but Malaga are taking the game to Leeds early doors. 2 mins: According to the man on the telly, Malaga are the \"Wimbledon of Spanish football.\" Nonsense. Seeing as I can't count the supporters on the fingers of one hand, I presume he's telling fibs. Alan Smith is fouled in the centre-circle. 1 min: After a minute's silence for a recently deceased former Spanish international whose name I didn't get, Malaga kick off. Preamble: It's the first leg of the third round of the Uefa Cup. Leeds are playing Malaga in Spain. I can't think of anything to say that will make this encounter a more mouth-watering prospect than it already is. Oh, I can. Duberry and Woodgate play together in the centre of the Leeds defence. Expect banter to be at a minimum between the two former bezzie mates. Malaga: Contreras, Roteta, Fernando Sanz, Valcarce, Romero, Josemi, Iznata, Manu, Sandro, Musampa, Dely Valdes. Subs: Rafa, Rojas, Litos, Edgar, Miguel Angel, Leko, Koke. Leeds: Robinson, Kelly, Duberry, Woodgate, Harte, Bowyer, Bakke, McPhail, Wilcox, Smith, Kewell. Subs: Martyn, Bridges, Okon, Burns, Richardson, Kilgallon. Referee: A Trentalange (Italy)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
