Britain's rowers go into the London Games under more pressure to deliver than any previous squad before them \u2013 not only because of the weight of a home Games in front of an expectant nation raised on images of Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave but because Team GB will be looking to Eton Dorney to deliver more than its share of precious metal. With Britain's cyclists unable to deliver as they did in Beijing due to rule changes, the rowers will be expected to step up to the plate and exceed their target of between four and six medals. In 2008 the total was six \u2013 two of each hue. The last World Championships, in Bled last September, illustrated two things: firstly that the British team would be hugely competitive, with 10 medals secured across the 14 Olympic classes, including three gold; but also that New Zealand in particular will provide hugely stiff competition. Katherine Grainger, a three-time Olympic silver medallist, and Anna Watkins have dominated in the double sculls since teaming up in 2010 and have high hopes for a gold medal. The lightweight men's double sculls pair Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter will also be well priced to repeat their gold from Beijing \u2013 if they get the nod from selectors. Both pairs won gold in Bled, along with the men's four of Tom James, Richard Egington, Alex Gregory and Matthew Langridge. The final squad is likely to be a mix of experienced hands and new faces, with final combinations unlikely to be completely finalised until the first week of June. Heather Stanning and Helen Glover, who only started rowing in 2008, stunned the rowing fraternity by finishing less than one tenth of a second behind the dominant Kiwi pair in Bled and will be looking to go one better in London. What's still to be decided? Even more so than most other sports, coaches and selectors face some huge decisions in the run-up to the Games. Chief among them for men's chief coach, J\u00fcrgen Grobler, will be what to do about the Andy Hodge and Peter Reed conundrum. By most measures the strongest rowers in the squad, they have had the misfortune to come up against a Kiwi coxless pair \u2013 Hamish Bond and Eric Murray \u2013 that has consistently beaten them. As such, Grobler could yet shift the duo \u2013 who won gold in the coxless four in Beijing \u2013 back into the four. That in turn would necessitate reshuffling the line-up in the men's eight. He also has to decide whether Purchase and Hunter should stay together, with others also pushing for a spot. With the best combinations on paper not always working on the water, there remains much to be decided. The fog should clear following the senior trials at Eton Dorney on 10 and 11 March. The first World Cup squad of the season on 4 April will provide a reliable guide to the final line-up barring injury or dramatic loss of form at two events in Belgrade and Lucerne. What they say David Tanner, Team GB manager \u00aaWe had a strong World Championships in September of 2011 with 10 Olympic and two Paralympic class medals and this helped Great Britain to qualify 47 from a possible 48 Olympic rowers and eight from a possible nine Paralympic rowers for the London Games, our best ever. We are an ambitious team and know that the rest of the world will raise their game in London so winning medals will be tough. As host nation, and a leading rowing nation, we will be a target for the rest of the world. The rowers have just returned this week to their national training base from two good overseas work camps in Portugal and South Africa. Good progress was made there and we now look forward to a solid few weeks of training in the UK before the GB Rowing Team Senior Trials take place on the Olympic course on March 10 and 11. As a squad we have strength in depth but we are not complacent. There is still much to do before we name our crews for the first World Cup of the season on 4 April. I am confident that, with the backing of extensive lottery funding over the past years, our Siemens-backed rowers \u2013 with our outstanding coaches and team support \u2013 are in good shape for the Games and will do TeamGB proud on home waters in front of a passionate home crowd at Eton-Dorney in July and August.\u00ba Guardian verdict Hopes are high after the world championships but four years ago New Zealand impressed at the same point before disappointing at the Games. With so much still to be decided, finding the right chemistry within the boats \u2013 blending those who have performed in previous Games with a new wave of young and hungry rowers \u2013 will be key to whether Team GB can exceed already lofty expectations. Beating the Beijing haul of six medals, including two golds, would be a huge achievement. 2013 New year honours? Competition will be tougher than ever but there will be plenty of success to cheer \u2013 not least, surely, the seemingly impregnable Watkins and Grainger. Shooting Team leader Phil Scanlan With six months to go \u2026 We're in a good place at the moment. Preparations are going as well as can be expected. We know it's going to be very tough to win medals but we won medals at world level in 2011 and we're hoping that's going to continue in 2012. After 2008, where we failed to win a medal, we went back to the drawing board and we're now more focused on a smaller number of athletes. We've been given nine host country start places but there is still a minimum standard to be attained. More quota places can be won at the Europeans next month. Medal tally prediction \u2026 We're aiming for a medal. I'd be stupid not to say we want gold but we know that to win any medal is going to be tough. Key dates 14-20 Feb: air pistol and air rifle European Champs, Finland. 2 May: final selection meeting Judo Performance director Daniel Lascau With six months to go \u2026 Euan Burton's bronze at the World Masters shows his consistency in training and I'm delighted to see him win a medal. This result really makes it possible for him to be seeded at the Olympic Games and that's the most important thing for him, to be positioned in the top eight in the world ranking list. I was pleased to see Karina Bryant win her first fight and she needs a little more time to win medals at these events but we're making progress. These are two players who are established at the highest level and can beat any opponent. Medal tally prediction \u2026 I hope we win a medal. We know Euan and Karina are capable of this and we have a number of athletes who are reaching this level. Key dates 26-28 Apr: European Championships, Russia. 12-13 May: British Open, K2 Crawley Hockey Performance director David Faulkner With six months to go \u2026 Since London was awarded the Games in 2005 both the men's and women's teams have climbed from 11th to fourth in the world rankings, in line with our target of gaining one place a year. England's men have become European champions for the first time and won a first Champions Trophy medal since 1985. The British women won bronze at the Europeans and Commonwealths and won World Cup and Champions Trophy medals for the first time. The women will compete in the Champions Trophy this weekend, a chance we didn't have prior to Beijing. Medal tally prediction \u2026 We believe Great Britain have two competitive teams seeking a podium finish at the London Olympic Games. Key dates 28 Jan -5 Feb: Women's Champions Trophy, Argentina. 2-6 May: Test event, London Modern Pentathlon Performance director Jan Bartu With six months to go \u2026 We're in the second half of the Olympic qualification process. The first part took place last year and Jamie Cooke and Freya Prentice both qualified for the Games at the European Championships in Medway, Kent, by finishing in the top eight. We also had a very good world championship, with two top-10 finishes. I'm feeling reasonably optimistic about the Games. We have up to four places in the Olympics but it is possible that more than four British athletes will qualify. It's an open process and anyone can still make the team. Medal tally prediction \u2026 Our high- level target would be two medals and the low target is one medal and one top-eight finish. Key dates 7-13 May: World championships, Rome. Late May: team selection to be concluded Handball Performance director Lorraine Brown With six months to go \u2026 The continued progress of the men's and women's teams show we remain on track to hit our London 2012 targets. The men will be using their final preparation phase from April to ensure they gain as much game experience to be best prepared. The current competitive results from the women provide evidence that they are starting to break into the next level of nations. They won against the African champions Angola at the London Prepares test event, a team that then went on to reach the quarter-finals at the recent world championships. Medal tally prediction \u2026 If both teams play at their best they have the potential to achieve their target of a top-eight finish. Key dates Mar: Women's Euro qualifier v Poland.
