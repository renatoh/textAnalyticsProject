The Unclaimed Assets Register (UAR), which already holds information on the owners of forgotten life policies, pensions and unit trusts, is extending its database to include unclaimed shares, dividends and securities. The register currently holds more than 2m records of lost pensions and life policies with an estimated value of \u00a3350m. It estimates there are a total of \u00a315bn in financial assets unclaimed by the public. Several FTSE 100 companies - including BP, British Telecom, Prudential and Vodafone - have already agreed to provide information to the register and the UAR hopes to have details of unclaimed shares and dividends from the majority of FTSE 100 companies within 12 months. Scottish Widows is also providing data on members who were entitled to windfall shares when it demutualised, but who the group were unable to trace. Keith Hollender, managing director of UAR, said: \"The main reason for investors losing track of their shareholdings is their own failure to inform registrars of a change of address. \"With 1.5m house moves a year and so many pressing things to think about when relocating, share registrars tend not to be top of the list and can often be permanently forgotten. \"A cocktail of moving, marrying and dying are the main causes of a lost investment, and company name changes do not help. Since 1995, 44 of the FTSE 100 have undergone a name change.\" The UAR estimates there is \u00a31bn in unclaimed life policies, \u00a33bn in personal pensions, \u00a33bn in shares and dividends, \u00a35bn in dormant banks and building societies, and \u00a33bn in national savings. Since its launch 18 months ago, it has reunited investors with more than \u00a31.3m of lost assets, with amounts recovered ranging from as little as 92p to \u00a336,000. It costs \u00a315 to search the database for unclaimed shares, life policies, personal pensions, and unit trusts - followed by a second search 12 months later. The register, owned by insurance group Aon, hopes to expand in the future to also include occupational pensions and dormant bank and building society accounts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
