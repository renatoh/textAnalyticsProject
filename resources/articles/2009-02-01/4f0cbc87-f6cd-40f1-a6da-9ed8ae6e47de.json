The former Manchester City forward Rolando Bianchi gave Torino the lead with a headed goal just after half-time before the Argentinian Nicol\u00e1s Burdisso headed in the equaliser. After a forgettable first half Inter came to life late on, with Hern\u00e1n Crespo and then Zlatan Ibrahimovic striking the woodwork and the substitute Ricardo Quaresma, who was heckled by the home support, spurning a great chance. \"I never like drawing at home but I accept it,\" said the Inter coach Jose Mourinho. \"We created lots of chances but Torino defended with a fantastic spirit.\" Genoa remain in fourth place after dominating Palermo at home, though they had to wait for Domenico Criscito's 88th minute goal to secure a 1\u20130 win, while fifth-placed Roma drew 2\u20132 at the bottom side Reggina on a muddy pitch. Lionel Messi came off the bench to score twice in the second half for the La Liga leaders Barcelona, who survived the late dismissals of Rafael M\u00e1rquez and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 for a 2\u20131 victory over Racing Santander. Racing gave the visitors little space and took the lead with Nikola Zigic's 56th-minute penalty, but Messi's introduction galvanised Barcelona. The Argentina winger scored from his first touch in the 65th minute, slotting in a loose ball at the near post, before chesting a looping ball into the right of the area and volleying in a right-foot winner. Elsewhere, Deportivo La Coruna beat Villarreal 3\u20130 at home, and Raul became Real Madrid's equal all-time top scorer with a goal in Saturday's 2\u20130 win over Numancia. He now has 307 for the club in all competitions. Werder Bremen's erratic Bundesliga season continued when they were beaten 2\u20131 at home by Arminia Bielefeld to remain 10th, while Bochum beat Karlsruhe 2\u20130 to go clear of the relegation zone. Hoffenheim have a two-point lead at the top of the table after a 2\u20130 victory over Energie Cottbus in the first league game at their new Rhein-Neckar-Arena."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
