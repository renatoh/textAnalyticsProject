Jensen was in Manchester yesterday, spending the day at City's training headquarters, but has yet to agree personal terms for the move. \"We have agreed a deal with his club, we do not have a deal yet with the player,\" said City's manager Kevin Keegan. \"I have to sit down with him and his agent and discuss terms and I am hopeful there is a good chance this will happen. He's had a look at the facilities and the lads.\" It was thought that Jensen, a left-sided wing-back whose contract expires in the summer, was to come to Maine Road on trial. The announcement that the move is to be made permanent will add to speculation over the future of Danny Tiatto, who plays in the same position and was sent off in City's 3-1 win over Norwich on Sunday. Southampton's 29-year-old midfielder Jo Tessem, who has not featured in the first team since October, has been given a 12-month extension to his contract, which now runs until 2005. \"I'm very pleased to have got it sorted out, because it had dragged on for a while. Now I can concentrate on getting back in the team,\" he said. \"I know I have to be patient, wait for my chance and then do my best to take it. I have lost a bit of match fitness, and with that a bit of confidence, but that will soon come back and I have not lost any belief in my own ability. I just want to play football. That is what I love.\" The Southampton striker Kevin Davies, who has been made available for transfer, has rejected a loan offer from First Division Burnley. Nick Barmby and Jamie Redknapp returned to training with Liverpool yesterday after, respectively, ankle and thigh injuries. Both are expected to play in next week's reserves' match against Blackburn. The Birmingham-based manufacturers of the world's most popular whistle for referees have designed a new model with a plastic cover to stop officials from feeling the cold on freezing winter match days. \"The Gatorgrip feels much more comfortable in the mouth,\" said a spokesman for J Hudson. \"But it isn't just about keeping out the cold. Some referees will find they get a better grip on the whistle when they're blowing it.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
