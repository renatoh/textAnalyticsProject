These children grew up and, in most cases, became incredibly conventional. This documentary tracks down some of the former Wilds and their radical parents, but fails to explore this fascinating premise. We meet one Dave Smith, who struggled against being \"the identifiable child of hippies\" by moving to Hong Kong and embracing materialism, but we get little sense of the deeper impact such an unconventional upbringing had on him. Will Hodgkinson T in the Park 2009 8pm, BBC3 Many of the acts who wowed at Glasto, including Blur and their greatest hits cavalcade, will be appearing at T in the Park in Kinross-shire, from where BBC3 offers blanket coverage of the likes of Nick Cave, Van Morrison and Pet Shop Boys, as well as the Killers and Snow Patrol.

After weeding out the celebrities of culinary criminality \u2013 Rowland Rivron's fried pasta and burnt ginger prawns take some topping \u2013 the three finalists aim to round off a tough week of challenges with the very best three-course meal they can muster. Rebecca Nicholson Us Now 11.10pm, More4 According to film-maker Ivo Gormley and a few other people who have come to the same conclusion, social media technologies are \"sparking the greatest social change since the invention of the printing press\". Gormley shows the way society is changing with the example of Zopa, a bank where people lend and borrow money from each other; and Mumsnet.com, a forum for mothers to exchange tips. Gormley is evangelical about the power of the net crowd and says little about the web's darker side, but although his film could have done with more balance his enthusiasm is encouraging.
