Plus \u00e7a change! Not, perhaps, in all British theatre, but certainly in this new adaptation of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin. Zola's novel (1867) and play (1873) examine human beings as post-Darwinian animal organisms, shaped by heredity and environment. His fiction is a laboratory for the analysis of human beings in their natural habitat; their actions are formed by surroundings and circumstances. Hence Zola's insistence on detailed realism of sets, costumes and acting styles. The problem with this is that \"natural\" for Zola is \"historic\" for us. Details that communicated a thousand little bits of information to his contemporaries are meaningless today. What's more, we have television and film as well as theatre. The author's four-act adaptation of his novel seems artificial and ponderous to a generation used to overlapping dialogue and swift camera work. What to do? Writer Helen Edmundson combines Zola's narrative and play in short scenes flowing one into another. Or rather, they would flow if it weren't for the to-ing and fro-ing of huge, featureless, pale walls redefining the architectural contours of the stage. To cover the time-consuming movements of Mike Britton's set, a chorus of costumed extras adds meaningful gestures and stares to their placing of minimal furniture and props, while the overwrought strings and piano of Dominic Haslam's score splash atmospheric colour. Consequently, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's adulterous liaison with Laurent, their murder of her husband and its discovery by her mother-in-law doesn't so much build in intensity as splutter towards it in fits and starts. Director Jonathan Munby's decision to aim for spectacular, melodramatic effects rather than psychological intensity is upset by this lack of pace and his coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre make the audience laugh instead of gasp \u2013 not because they are ineffective, but because tension levels are misaligned. It is the actors who give the production its expressive coherence. In particular, Pippa Nixon as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: seldom out of sight, she is a charged, compelling presence, finely calibrating her shifts of emotional pitch. Alison Steadman's stroke-stricken Madame Raquin is terrible to behold; Hugh Skinner is a haunting presence as the murdered husband while Kieran Bew finds Laurent's forcefulness in his closing despair. Desmond Barrit, Michael Mears and Charlotte Mills are all strikingly individual in their character roles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
