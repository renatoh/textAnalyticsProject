Someone with a sense of humour to accompany me to weddings and other major life events. First impressions? Handsome man with crisis bleached hair. What did you talk about? Travels, family dynamics and other unspeakable things. His mum\u2019s new life in Margate and my previous life as a puppeteer. Any awkward moments? I think he thought I was trying to snog him when I asked about his attitude to social distancing. Good table manners? The best \u2013 kept my glass full and pretended not to notice when I burped. Best thing about Rufus? He was really easy to talk to. He made everything feel normal right away and kept the conversation going. Would you introduce him to your friends? I\u2019d probably get replaced. Describe Rufus in three words Sweet, fun, relaxed. What do you think he made of you? That I was an aged old queer. Did you go on somewhere? Due to Bojo\u2019s curfew, this was not really an option. I did bring G&amp;T tinnies in my bag, just in case, but the vibes were not there. I drank mine on the way home. If it weren\u2019t for social distancing, would you have kissed? I would probably need a stepladder. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? We\u2019d probably have got on better had we met at a house party in non-pandemic times. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Maybe as friends. Rufus on Freddy What were you hoping for? A laugh, fun company, lovely grub. First impressions? Oh, I am a lot taller than him. What did you talk about? The brief amount of stuff we knew about each other prior to the date. The classic coronavirus filler chat, politics, our favourite flicks. Any awkward moments? I commented on his restless leg, which I felt a bit bad about because he tried to stop it but couldn\u2019t. Good table manners? Yes, very. He showed an interest in what the waiters had to tell us and kept our glasses topped up. Best thing about Freddy? He was easy to talk to and had an interesting background. Would you introduce him to your friends? If he\u2019s happy to get with them (Spice Girls, 1996). Describe Freddy in three words? Friendly, articulate, engaging. What do you think he made of you? Hopefully that I was quite pleasant and chilled, maybe that I can put away a lot of scran\u2026 God knows. Did you go on somewhere? The tube, where we parted ways. If it weren\u2019t for social distancing, would you have kissed? No, I don\u2019t think so. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I\u2019d have sunk a couple more bevs, lived, laughed, loved and danced on the table, but the curfew was calling. Marks out of 10? 6. Would you meet again? Probably not, unless I get an invite to the premiere of the musical he\u2019s writing. We shall see. \u2022 Freddy and Rufus ate at Kolamba, London W1.
