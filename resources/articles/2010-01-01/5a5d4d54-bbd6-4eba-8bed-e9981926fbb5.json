While Laws certainly did not deserve to see his first match in charge of a Premier League side end with such a deceptively crushing scoreline, Sir Alex Ferguson must be praying Dimitar Berbatov can keep playing through the pain barrier and continue postponing a looming knee operation. After a deceptively quiet first half, Berbatov awoke to brilliantly score one goal and conjure another for Wayne Rooney as United reignited their title challenge on a strange sort of afternoon which had earlier seen Burnley spurn two glorious chances. \"Maybe the scoreline was a bit unfair on them,\" said Ferguson. \"It was a funny game, we were very frivolous, Burnley missed good breakaways and it could have been embarrassing. Maybe we were a bit nervous but, for a long time, I thought Berbatov was the one player who looked like scoring. He was feeling his knee and could have gone off at half time but he wanted to stay on..\" Allied to much gloomy talk of debts, bonds, refinancings and the Glazer family, a shock home FA Cup exit to League One Leeds and a disappointing league draw at Birmingham had sent ominous storm clouds scudding over Old Trafford. Even United's players did not seem immune to such pessimism during an unimpressive opening in which the moment Nani swiped thin air as he failed to connect with an Antonio Valencia cross seemed horribly emblematic.In contrast Laws had grounds for cautious optimism and leapt to his feet when David Nugent's counter-attacking pass left Steven Fletcher with just Edwin van der Sar to beat. Fortunately for United's goalkeeper \u2013 playing for the first time after his wife's illness \u2013 Fletcher's first touch was a little wonky and the ensuing shot flashed tantalising wide of a post, thereby sparing Gary Neville's blushes. Granted, Ferguson's side enjoyed considerable possession but, with Michael Carrick worryingly out of sorts, they created precious few serious early openings. Instead Laws's highly flexible 4-2-3-1 formation largely worked well, serving as a springboard for several dangerous breaks with Chris Eagles, once of United, invariably proving an attacking catalyst. One superb chipped pass from Eagles fell for Nugent in the area but he could not quite muster the degree of technical excellence required to pull off the necessary volleyed finish. It was the sort of delivery from which Berbatov often scores stupendous goals but, initially, the Bulgarian kept his exquisite technique well concealed, appearing primarily concerned with making regular trips to the touchline for pain killing knee spraying. Early in the second half though we saw a touch of the extravagant skill which makes him such a joy to watch. First came a flicked one-two with the industrious Valencia \u2013 lucky to escape unpunished for the high tackle which saw Fletcher hospitalised awaiting ankle X-rays \u2013 and then a half volley which swerved fractionally wide. Within minutes Nugent beat Neville to Eagles's through pass before unleashing a shot with the outside of his right foot which, tantalisingly, flew just the wrong side of an upright. Visiting fans taunted their hosts with choruses of \"Where's your lolly gone,\" but Burnley had failed to seize the moment. They duly paid for it when cute little passes from Nani and Rooney enabled Berbatov to wrongfoot Michael Duff before evading Brian Jensen courtesy of a fabulous angled left-foot strike. Suddenly United were swaggering and Rooney dodged two challenges to place the second goal in the corner after Jensen parried another fine Berbatov effort. Finally substitute Mame Diouf's late, looping header beat the advancing Jensen for the third time, leaving Laws disappointed yet strangely encouraged. \"We didn't take our opportunities,\" he said. \"It might have been an interesting story if we'd scored first.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Sophie Quirke, Observer reader The scoreline was definitely flattering. We were really pedestrian in the first half. We only had one ball that we knocked into the box, and the players' heads seemed to be down. We're very lightweight in midfield \u2013 there's not much creativity and no flow. Berbatov had a couple of nice touches but the crowd seemed to be getting frustrated with him. I don't know if he is putting too much pressure on himself. There was an anti-Glazer meeting before the game and some songs sung at the end. It was the only real time the crowd got going. The fan's player ratings Van der Sar 7; Neville 6, Brown 5, Evans 6, Evra 6; Valencia 6, Carrick 5 (Anderson 63 6), Scholes 6, Nani 4; Berbatov 5 (Owen 73 4), Rooney 5 (Diouf 73 5) Martin Barnes, When the Ball Moves We were a bit unlucky. We should have taken the lead when Nugent had a chance in the second half. It was a fairly predictable starting XI from Laws, but whether that will be his line-up when everyone is fit remains to be seen. I'm fairly underwhelmed by the appointment, but we've got to give the guy a chance. If Coyle had left at the end of the season then I think people would understand. He was always preaching integrity and he's basically gone back on all of that. A win at Bolton in our next league game would be nice. The fan's player ratings Jensen 6; Mears 7, Duff 8, Edgar 8, Jordan 7; Alexander 7, McDonald 6 (Gudjonsson 73 n/a); Nugent 6, Elliott 6, Eagles 7 (Blake 83 n/a); Fletcher 6 (Thompson 37 6) TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, EMAIL FANS.PREMIER@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
