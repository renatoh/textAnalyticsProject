All things considered, Rio is going rather well", "bodyText": "The beach volleyball arena on Copacabana, placed in a prime telegenic site on the world\u2019s most famous strand and housing one of Brazil\u2019s favourite sports, was supposed to be one of the focal points of South America\u2019s first Olympic Games. Instead it has come to symbolise many of the issues in the first week of Rio 2016, as organisers try to stage 28 simultaneous world championships in one of the most logistically challenging cities in the world. That they must do so in the teeth of an economic meltdown that has put huge pressure on budgets, and a political crisis that has inevitably left many Cariocas with other priorities, should invite sympathy rather than opprobrium. In truth, things are going as well as can be expected. But the empty seats at the beach volleyball have been replicated across other venues, with organisers facing a struggle to square their claim that 80% of tickets have been sold. The extent to which Copacabana was fenced off to house the beach volleyball arena, as well as a vast megastore and grandstands for the road cycling races, seemed to signify a lack of inclusivity that stoked irritation among those sceptical about hosting a major sporting jamboree at this time. It was often said during the run up to London 2012 that an Olympics is the most challenging logistical puzzle that any country can face, outside wartime. And the first week of the Rio Games has been anything but dull. There has been a long-running argument over whether an attack on a media bus was caused by gunfire or rocks; a bullet was found in the equestrian media centre and another by the stables (the latter from a shoot-out with police in a nearby favela); one soldier has been killed, and somewhat oddly deified given the daily toll elsewhere in the city; and there have been at least three controlled explosions. Given this backdrop, it is no wonder that endless questions from the world\u2019s press about whether the buses are running on time or about queues in the canteen are often greeted with a shrug. The undercurrent of free-wheeling chaos nibbling at the edges of the Truman Show-style Olympic bubble, with its air conditioned, Wi-Fi enabled media buses running along Zil lanes with an armed escort, past a mix of five star hotels and grinding poverty has, in some ways, been heartening. As with the South Africa and Brazil World Cups, this is a reminder that if the privileged captains of global sport still expect to pitch up in a developing country and demand it takes all the risk and gets none of the upside of hosting them, then they must think again. The IOC likes to consider itself superior to Fifa, holding endless \u201cco-ordination commissions\u201d in the run-up to each Games and playing up legacy themes. But a self-regarding body with reserves of close to $1bn that has just signed a TV deal with NBC for $7.75bn and is spending $600m on a new Olympic channel can afford to do much more. A lot of the wrinkles, that have caused a daily barrage of questions for increasingly weary Rio 2016 chief spokesman Mario Andrada, concern the very areas that the IOC should invest in if it wants to change its image. The ill thought-out ticketing programme, for example. Once it became clear that many venues would have empty seats, the IOC could have put contingency plans in place. And, when the organising committee slashed the budget for volunteers, the brightly clad army of free labour who have set the tone for every Games since Sydney, surely the IOC should have helped out. Instead, many of those soldiering on here look exhausted. It could have pushed those sports unfamiliar to Brazilians, put its marketing muscle behind innovative ways to engage the populace, subsidised ticket prices, better supported a haphazard attempt to give away hundreds of thousands of tickets to schoolchildren, and it could have used its expertise to fix transport and signage issues and made it easier and more attractive for fans to travel. In short, if the \u201cOlympic family\u201d wants to bask in the warm glow of taking its \u201cmovement\u201d to new parts of the world, it had better be prepared to invest to get the local population on board and put some of its own vast resources into making it work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
