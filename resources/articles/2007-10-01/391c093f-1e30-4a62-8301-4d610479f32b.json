At the degenerate court of Louis XVI, the swordplay is replaced by the even sharper tongues of courtly wits: Charles Berling's provincial engineer Ponce-ludon, appealing for funds for his land-reclamation scheme, proves surprisingly adept in an elegant essay on corruption. London to Brighton 12midnight, Sky Movies Premiere (Paul Andrew Williams, 2006) A beaten-up street prostitute (Lorraine Stanley) and a runaway 12-year-old (Georgia Groome) flee to Brighton to escape from a vengeful gangster (Sam Spruell) and his sleazy pimp (Johnny Harris). The story unfolds deftly through extended flashbacks and evokes a foul world of sociopathic violence and paedophilia: not the most comfortable of viewing, but it makes for a gritty, morally complex drama. Devils On the Doorstep 12.30am, Film4 (Wen Jiang, 2000) Shot in stark black and white and set in northern China in winter 1944, this tale of the Japanese occupation depicts war as a bitter mix of horror and farce. Wen Jiang also stars, as a villager thrust into danger when a mysterious gunman leaves two hostages in his care - a Japanese soldier and a Chinese collaborator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
