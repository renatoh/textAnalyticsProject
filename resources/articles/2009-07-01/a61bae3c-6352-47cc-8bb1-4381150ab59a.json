He describes his vision of applying the principles of engineering to create purpose-built organisms from a catalogue of standard components in a controllable and predictable way. Measured against the early progress of electronics, synthetic biologists may still be in the 1950s, but Freemont points to the recent creation of yeast that manufacture the anti-malarial artemisinin and algae that produce biofuel as hopeful signs of what might be possible. Turning our gaze heavenwards, on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 we speak to the man responsible for getting Nasa back to the moon, and perhaps beyond to Mars. Dr John Olson at Nasa headquarters in Washington DC told Andy Duckworth about the agency's ambitions. All that plus the unexpectedly swift rise of swine flu, the improbable alliance between an oil giant and a geneticist to create those biofuel algae Dr Olson mentioned; and a radical plan to break the UK's carbon habit, slashing emissions and ramping up renewables like wind and wave power.
