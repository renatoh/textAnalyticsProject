The argument is that there are some bits of biology - eyes are a favourite example - so intricate, so clever and so difficult to explain that they must have been fabricated by somebody or something more intelligent than the operation of natural selection upon random mutation (or evolution, for short). Furthermore, say the Creationists (what else would a supernatural intelligent designer be but a Creator?), intelligent design is just as much science as evolutionary biology. Well, not if it hinges on the evidence of irreducible complexity. Irreducible complexity is the brick wall at which all science stops. Until Copernicus, Galileo and Newton came along, the motions of the planets were irreducibly complex and God sustained them, and that was all you needed to know. Influenza was a consequence of planetary influences, so it was beyond earthly explanation. Malaria was spread by bad air (hence the name mal aria) so you had to protect yourself with a scented handkerchief. Human flight, of course, was something that would never happen. And matter - all matter - was fabricated from fire, air, earth and water, with possible help from a quintessence. Life was a vital spark. And so on. If researchers had, over the last 300 years, accepted the argument that difficult-to-understand phenomena were irreducibly complex, most of us would never have been born. Those that were born and then survived might have their faces pitted by smallpox, their lungs scarred by tuberculosis and their limbs withered by polio. They would of course have no telephones, no television, and no Ryanair flights, because the science behind all of these things must once have seemed irreducibly complex to somebody, indeed to everybody. And I'll bet that even the most obdurate Creationists are glad not be afflicted by leprosy, smallpox and tuberculosis, even though such scientific, not to say biological, advances were achieved without overt miraculous intervention. So the great puzzle is: if something that somebody once thought irreducibly complex turned out centuries later to be a breeze for a bright young people with faith in the scientific method, why should people throw up their hands and say \"No, the eye is irreducibly complex. God must have made it. Evolution as explained by Darwin could not have achieved it. And anyway, the eye looks as if it were designed for its purpose. So it is reasonable to believe that there must have been a Designer?\" Evolutionary biologists have their own confident answers about the multiple evolution of the eye. The argument from design however, is not new but 200 years old. In 1800, practically the whole of Judaeo-Christian Europe and America accepted that God had made the world, with all its myriad creatures, in roughly six days, about 2,400 human generations earlier, and that so-called fossils were, just like landscape marble, \"sports of nature\". It was in such a context that Archdeacon William Paley proposed his notorious Argument from Design, and even then his logic must have looked pretty flaky. In 1802, in a book called Natural Theology, Paley argued that you could stare at the world and see what worked. If it worked, then it only did so because God intended it to work. \"There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance without a contriver; order without choice, arrangement without anything capable of arrangement,\" he wrote and he concluded \"Arrangement, disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an end, relation of instruments to a use, imply the presence of intelligence and mind.\" In effect, you could demonstrate the existence of God from His handiwork, except, ironically, when it came to vision. The eye worried William Paley. He thought the eye such a clumsy contrivance (\"Contrivance, by its very definition and nature, is the refuge of imperfection,\" he wrote) that he had to explain why it was nevertheless evidence of a Designer. According to Charles Coulston Gillispie's marvellous Genesis and Geology (1951), Paley concluded that God employed roundabout makeshifts just to let people know that He existed: the eye served as a kind of Divine nudge, nudge, wink, wink. William Paley lost the argument 140 years ago, not because 19th century England lost its faith in God, but because Paley put up a bad argument, and because Charles Darwin 60 years later put up a hypothesis, and a package of evidence so compelling that the great biologist Thomas Henry Huxley is supposed to have said \"How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that\". So here is a paradox: today's intelligent designers argue that the eye is direct evidence of the hand of God because it is too clever for evolution to have achieved, while yesterday's more overtly religious, more classically-educated intelligent designers thought that the eye looked like a clumsy biological compromise, while all along it could only have been God's handiwork. But here is the other paradox: today's intelligent designers concede that some sort of adaptation or evolution has indeed taken place. They just balk at accepting the whole theory because they will not accept that there could be a natural explanation of the biological riddles that have not yet been solved. Is that science? It isn't logic. It isn't even common sense. And when supporters of intelligent design make claims about Darwin that are palpably untrue, it certainly isn't Christian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
