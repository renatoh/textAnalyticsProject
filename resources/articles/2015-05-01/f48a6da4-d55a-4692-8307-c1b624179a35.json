Consider the condition of Mr Pitt\u2019s body, and indeed Lord Nelson\u2019s \u2026\u201d \u2013 Norrell Oh, I see. Bring a woman back to life \u2013 albeit with fewer fingers than she had before \u2013 then conjure up a fleet of ships made out of rain to fool the French, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re flavour of the month. Pick of the week. Soup of the day. After being firmly dismissed by Samuel West\u2019s Lord Pole last week, Norrell \u2013 and his magic bowl \u2013 are now guests of honour in parliament and at Pole\u2019s evening soirees, where I noticed that no one was in the least bit freaked out that Lady Pole once again walked among them, despite being \u201cquite dead\u201d just days before. She also now seems unable to suppress sudden urges to cut a rug. Norrell\u2019s ensconcement in government and high society is complete, with Drawlight and Lascelles in their smarmy element, as evidenced by the former\u2019s catty after-dinner gags at the expense of other, lesser conjurers. Drawlight: \u201cHe was no more a magician than I\u2019m the Duchess of Devonshire \u2026\u201d Drawlight: \u201cThe only thing he was able to make disappear was claret \u2026\u201d You see? In his element, and persisting with this \u201cNorrrrelle\u201d foolishness too. The wily Lascelles, meanwhile, appears to be in this for the long game, having already installed himself as the editor of the periodical The Friends of English Magic. He has an angle, that chap, of that there should be no doubt. \u201cThere was once a Christian named Julius Caesar \u2026 who landed in England and was met by three gentleman, all named John Hollyshoes \u2026\u201d \u2013 Lady Pole It appears that one of the elements of the enchantment of Lady Pole (the excellent Alice Englert), who gradually becomes more disturbed as the episode goes on, is that she cannot speak of it. Instead, she utters streams of almost poetic nonsense, like those weird spam emails. She tries first to speak to Norrell and Lord Pole, then later to Arabella, whom she implores to return. Lady Pole: \u201cI see no one \u2026 or rather, I see roomfuls of people and not a Christian among them.\u201d Judging by the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair\u2019s gob-open drooling at Arabella later in the episode, it looks as if Lady Pole may soon have to share the Gentleman\u2019s fickle affections. \u201cThe dream, sir, was mine. I lay down here on purpose to dream it \u2026\u201d \u2013 Strange This week we truly got to know Bertie Carvel\u2019s Strange, Segundus and Honeyfoot happening upon him at Starecross Hall. Purpose now seems to suit him, invigorated as he is with his pursuit of magic. His disdain upon meeting Drawlight and Lascelles in Hanover Square was delightful, as was the reaction by Norrell at his display of magic. So rarely does Marsan\u2019s Norrell smile, that when he does, with the broad beam of a rosy-cheeked scamp being given a shiny sixpence, it is a true joy to behold. He found a kindred spirit in Strange, and there is a great electricity between Marsan and Carvel already. Said friendship is certainly detected by Lascelles and Drawlight, who are immediately put on the back foot. Drawlight: \u201cWhat\u2019s that? A most peculiar sound \u2026\u201d Lascelles: \u201cI think Mr Norrell is laughing. We shall have to do something about this \u2018friendship\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe nameless slave shall be a king in a strange land \u2026\u201d \u2013 The Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair Like the other servants \u2013 and Lady Pole herself \u2013 Stephen Black can hear the bells calling at the Pole residence in Harley Street. He meets the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair and provides barber services so accomplished that the Gentleman deems him to be the \u201cnameless slave\u201d from the prophesy of the Raven King, a man set to become a \u201cking in a strange land\u201d. He invites him over to Lost Hope for dinner and dancing. But without the dinner. \u201cWe have been dancing there for days, and days, and days,\u201d he explains, as if describing something akin to Castlemorton but without all the sound systems, complaints to the local constabulary and dogs on strings. If there are dogs there, they are certainly not on strings, but allowed to roam free and join in the dancing. \u201cThey\u2019re called horses \u2026 I made them out of horse sand. Hot rolls and marmalade, anyone?\u201d This was the moment Norrell realised that Strange, hunched and growling in the sand at Portsmouth, is not a pupil but a rival, able to perform magic without the dogged use of books and reference. He is Miles Davis to Norrell\u2019s Kenny G, the Hendrix to his Rick Parfitt. Though books do help, of course. Norrell\u2019s devastation at losing 40 of the blighters to Strange was palpable, as he agreed to dispatch him to the Peninsula to be that magician on the ground the British forces need, thus rendering him unable to bid for the Duke of Roxburghe\u2019s collection of magical books \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t stop Arabella forcing Norrell to get out his cheque book. There was some criticism of the pace of episode one. I felt that to an extent on my first watch, but after seeing it a couple of times, I learned to relish certain scenes all the more \u2013 the library at the soiree, in particular (\u201cThat man is reading a book!\u201d). Episode two hit its stride, I felt, with big guns brought out in CGI style (them there horses). Marsan and Carvel\u2019s tentative circling of one another was particularly pleasing. I even started to like the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair\u2019s thistledown hair. It\u2019s growing on me. (Figuratively, thank God.) Other matters of note Arabella\u2019s sterling put-downs The formidable Arabella has a brilliant line in needling Strange, from weary to barbed and spiky, as and when necessity calls. Arabella: \u201cCalm down, you\u2019ll give yourself a nosebleed \u2026\u201d Strange: \u201cI no longer have nosebleeds, I\u2019ve not had a nosebleed since I was 17!\u201d Arabella: \u201cDo take an egg before he eats them all \u2026\u201d Strange: \u201cArabella does not care for seed cake. It is a thing that she particularly dislikes.\u201d Arabella: \u201cArabella is not a three-year-old, Jonathan.\u201d Shakespearean confusion \u2026 Amid my snarky remarks about the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair\u2019s woodland garms last week, I was pulled up in the comments for comparing the outfit to \u201ca sixth form production of Twelfth Night\u201d when I probably meant A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. I did, and it serves me quite right. Hat of the week Hat of the week this week* goes to \u2026 Mr Gilbert Norrell of Hanover Square, London, for his almost impertinent smoking cap. Apart from the fez, you just don\u2019t see enough tasselled hats, and this one was a real treat. Runner-up was Mr Honeyfoot of York for a serviceable tricorn. (*There may not be another \u201chat of the week\u201d, it might very well just be this week, unless a particularly wonderful hat comes along in future episodes.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
