I was first introduced to the concept of the earworm by a nice German lady, who pronounced it with a hard w (like the v in \"willlage\"), taken, as it is, directly from the German 'Ohrwurm' - but although I may have been late arriving at the word, I had known about the concept ever since I first heard Chas n' Dave's Snooker Loopy. Or was it the music from the Um Bongo advert? An earworm, of course, is the word for those annoying songs that you simply can't get out of your head. And why am I thinking about those? Well because I realised that at least one TV programme tonight will be sponsored by Sheila's Wheels, with a jingle so annoying it's being cited as defence for rage-killings in rural Shropshire and spontaneous combustions in Kathmandu. Also I was trying to find out if anything of note happened on this day in history, and discovered that the Barbie doll was launched in 1958. Which not only has nothing to do with what's on TV tonight whatsoever, it has also had the side effect of implanting the song Barbie Girl in my head. Grr. I tell you what, to try and force it out, I will read out loud tonight's TV previews, taken from this week's Guide. Maybe that will work. Rogue Raiders: Baboon Badlands 7.15pm, Five As if South Africa didn't have enough social problems, some towns have to contend with troops of terrorising baboons. They come down from the hills en masse and pretty much take over, going through the bins, breaking into homes and throwing tiles off the roof. \"Peacekeepers\" have been employed to keep the baboons away - problem is, the monkeys just wait for them to go off duty before heading to town. Martin Skegg I'm a Barbie gir - oh SHUSH Anna Waterloo Road 8pm, BBC1 New school drama from the makers of Bad Girls and Footballers' Wives. But without the neon campery. Jill Halfpenny stars with Jason Merrells, Jason Done and Camilla Power. Their school, Waterloo Road Comp in Manchester, is full of violent underachievers and new deputy head Jamie Glover is the well-spoken do-gooder who wants to turn it around. This excels in the love intrigue bits, but the minutiae of school life is dull. A bit mid-league table. Julia Raeside The Road To Guantanamo 9pm, C4 Michael Winterbottom's examination of the so-called Tipton Taliban. Asif, Ruhel and Shafiq narrate their bizarre experience in after-the-fact interviews, in between reconstructions of their tale, shot in the same lo-fi, home-movie style as Winterbottom's In This World. There may be those who find aspects farfetched, but certainly no more so than the idea of America's absurd Cuban gulag: of the estimated 750 prisoners who've passed through Guantanamo, only one has been charged, and none - including these British citizens, held for three years - found guilty of anything. Andrew Mueller The English Patient (Anthony Minghella, 1996) 8pm, FilmFour Before he was involved in an epic, arthouse romance with Rachel Weisz in The Constant Gardener, Ralph \"call me Rafe\" Fiennes was courting Kristin Scott Thomas in this epic, arthouse romance. The second world war is the backdrop here, Fiennes' mysterious Count slowly revealing his story of Saharan espionage and doomed love to Juliette Binoche. With Naveen \"Lost\" Andrews. Richard Vine ... in a Barbie wuh-huh-huld... damn it! Under The Tuscan Sun (Audrey Wells, 2003) 8pm, Sky Movies 2 \"Life offers you a thousand chances... all you have to do is take one.\" Diane Lane heads off to Tuscany after finding out her husband's been having an affair (payback for Unfaithful, maybe?). There she falls in love with a rundown villa, hires some off-the-radar Polish immigrants to pull an extreme makeover on it for her, and then finds a not-so-rundown local boy (Raoul Bava) to come over and help with all that olive oil pressing. Lane's always capable of some degree of depth. Shame she settles for the shallows of \"chick-flick\" predictability here. Sandra \"Sideways\" Oh and Lindsay \"Rome\" Duncan are on tap for moral support. Richard Vine Cold Case 9pm, Sky One Yet again, Lilly Rush and her Philadelphia detectives crack a dusty unsolved crime with curious ease. This time it's a baby Jane Doe who died in 1965, yet whose bones have barely been fished out of the river before witnesses are popping up to tell her story. Have the 'tecs got supernatural powers? Or are people in Philly just really helpful, with the memories of elephants? For once, it doesn't matter. What takes over instead is the way that the inevitably sugary 1960s flashbacks - complete with hairsprayed helmet hair, bopping teens in diners and a girl groups soundtrack - tell a far-from-sugary, serious storyline about corrupt cops, domestic violence and child abuse. Smart stuff. Katrina Dixon ______________________________ Come on Barbie let's go party Ah, ah, ah yeah Come on Bar... Oh hell, it didn't. Does anyone have a cure for the dreaded earworm? Has anyone got one that doesn't involve glasses of water and hanging upside down? Because let's face it, I'm a 28-year-old journalist singing a five-year-old pop song on a loop, I don't really want to look any more stupid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
