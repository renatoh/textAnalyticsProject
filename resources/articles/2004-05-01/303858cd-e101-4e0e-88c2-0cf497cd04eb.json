The careers adviser quoted stats on where others with my degree in physics and meteorology had found work, then randomly searched for numbers to contact. I could have done that. Sarah, Edinburgh My sister had a brilliant adviser at school, full of interesting suggestions for exciting courses. I'm glad she had that because by the time I was choosing, we had personal advisers who were there for those with big problems. The rest of us had to rely on friends and family. Nitya, Essex The best advice I've had is not from careers professionals, but from those working in the industry. Trish, London With encouragement from my college tutor I went on to a degree in art history. The university offered no career advice to people on my course, just an irregularly available adviser. After an MA in film studies and 18 months in a disheartening job, I visited the university careers adviser - he had no idea what the MA had covered or what I could do with it. Others from my course are working in call centres. My advice? Do a vocational qualification - you're much more likely to get a job. Kim, Yeovil It was invaluable, even though I knew what I wanted to do. Specific questions about postgraduate qualifications were answered, I was given good leads to follow up and got great help with my CV.
