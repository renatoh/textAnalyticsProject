The 20-year-old was hurt during a scrummaging session and was taken by ambulance to the intensive care unit at Northampton General hospital where he was due to undergo an operation last night to re-align the neck using traction. The Leicester youngster, who has won four Under-21 caps, was preparing for Friday night's international against Scotland at Franklin's Gardens. With Jonny Wilkinson's fitness problems having already alerted the public to the physical dangers inherent within the sport, this latest incident will reinforce that message even more starkly. Serious neck injuries remain mercifully rare, however, particularly at representative level where shoulders and knees tend to be most at risk. In such circumstances, even Wilkinson's woes have to be put in perspective and the entire rugby community will be praying Hampson recovers. \"Our immediate concerns are with Matt and his family,\" said the Under-21 manager Pete Drewett. \"Matt is getting the best treatment available and we aim to make a further announcement following his operation.\" Hampson was spotted early on as a player of great promise. He joined Leicester's Academy at Under-16 level and became an apprentice at the start of the 2001-02 season. He was one of five development squad players who trained with the Tigers during the summer and started at tight-head in last week's Under-21 victory over Italy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
