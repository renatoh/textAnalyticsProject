For the past 12 months, rumours have circulated that he was about to resign or be sacked. Last week, Scope confirmed what had been the subject of a fresh outbreak of gossip: the man who set out to reform and transform one of Britain's best known charities had departed. The press statement simply said that he had completed many of the objectives of a three-year programme of reform and renewal that was part of his brief when he was appointed in February, 2003. But for many in the world of disability charities, that was not the whole story. The charity has been through some turbulent times since 2003 and Manwaring has taken a lot of personal criticism, from parents of disabled people and from within Scope itself. He was behind emergency measures to stave off a \u00a310m-plus budget deficit (due in part to a downturn in donations) and set in train plans to close 50 of its residential homes within the next 10 years. Opposition to Scope's reorganisation crystallised in March last year around the closure of Cyncoed House in Cardiff. Parents of 11 residents there claimed that the charity had \"total disregard\" for residents' needs and they called for the resignation of the charity's executives and trustees. Cardiff MPs published a Commons early day motion noting Scope's \"moral obligation as a charity to put the interests of highly vulnerable people before profit\". Campaigners linked what they saw as the \"ruthless\" closure of care homes and respite centres, redundancies of care workers, field staff and shop staff with the apparent increase in management expenses at Scope's refurbished offices in London. One critic, who works for Scope, claimed last week that Manwaring's management style often brought him into conflict with staff. A former employee said that Manwaring \"was not good at carrying staff with him or working through disagreements\". There was also frustration in some quarters that the editorial freedom of Scope's news magazine, Disability Now, which had nurtured an independent approach, was being compromised. Manwaring had responded vigorously to the Cyncoed row. Scope had completed a major policy review in which it had set out its intention of withdrawing, over 10 years, from institutional care provision. The charity says it has spent too long and too much - by its own calculations, some \u00a3174m - subsidising state provision. Manwaring also argued that institutional care \"disempowered\" some residents by removing them from the local community. He was instrumental in turning Scope's focus on to encouraging people with disabilities to move into mainstream education and accommodation, and changing the public's perception of disabled people as inferior to others. Scope would not comment on the exact circumstances of Manwaring's departure, and he has not responded to attempts by Society Guardian to contact him. In the press statement, Manwaring is praised for playing a \"leading role\" in driving forward diversity within the organisation. More than 17% of Scope's workforce of 3,500 now comprises people with disabilities, compared with only 4% when he took over. Scope says this is the \"highest proportion of any major employer we know\". The statement also praises Manwaring for establishing a clear identity for Scope, building alliances within the broader disability community, and turning around financial problems. The current deficit stands at just over \u00a37m, but the charity is expected to be in surplus in 2008/09. Some argue that Manwaring sought to make too many changes, too fast, to an organisation that is still essentially paternalistic and largely parent-led in approach. His vision was right, but his tactics were wrong. Ann Pridmore, chair of the British Association for Disabled People, says she is sorry to see Manwaring go, and she wants Scope to carry on where he left off. \"Tony really was making a difference,\" she says. \"He got more disabled people employed by Scope, and that was quite unpopular.\" Rachel Hurst, the founder of Disability Awareness in Action, claims that the carping is because Manwaring has upset the \"able-bodied\" status quo. \"What he was trying to do was unique and he has a grasp of disability rights that is rarely seen in an able-bodied person,\" she says. \"As far as I can see, he was supporting disabled people, rather than providing services that they didn't want and that were keeping them on the sidelines of society.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
