I own 40% of the property and a housing association owns the other 60%. I intend to buy the remaining 60% with my partner, who recently moved in with me. We will then jointly pay off the remainder of the existing 40% and the other 60%, and her name will be added to the title deeds. We are in the process of drawing up an agreement to cover the various scenarios in the unlikely event we should ever separate. We are keen to ensure we contribute and benefit equally from this arrangement, so my partner will also put up a deposit equal in value to the equity I have in the flat. To this end, should we also take into consideration the interest I have been paying during the early years of the mortgage, as interest payments are higher during the early years of a mortgage? AZ A No, I do not think you need to take the interest you have paid up until now into account. Paying interest on a mortgage is a bit like paying rent, in as much as it buys you the right to live in the property. Until now, your partner hasn't benefited from being able to live in your flat and so, rightly, didn't pay any interest. Or to put it another way, taking past interest into account would be like asking her to contribute to your expenses for the last three years, which seems blatantly unfair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
