Mark Hughes has shown interest in the West Bromwich Albion striker in the past two transfer windows and the Stoke manager had thought his hopes of sealing a transfer were fading. However, with Berahino\u2019s contract expiring in the summer and the 23-year-old having failed to make a first-team appearance since September, West Brom were keen to resolve the issue before the end of the month and accepted a bid of an initial \u00a312m, with a further \u00a33m potentially due in bonuses. Berahino has signed a five-and-a-half-year deal. The Stoke City chief executive, Tony Scholes, said: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we have been looking to bring Saido to the club for a long time and to suggest we are pleased to have finally concluded the deal is an understatement. \u201cWe\u2019ve signed a young English striker who has already proven his ability in the Premier League. After a frustrating period he\u2019s now desperately keen to reignite his career.\u201d The conclusion of the deal was in contrast to earlier in the day when neither Hughes nor the West Brom manager, Tony Pulis, sounded optimistic about reaching an agreement. Hughes said there had been no progress since last week while Pulis described Stoke\u2019s initial offer as \u201cnowhere near\u201d West Brom\u2019s valuation of the player. \u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed and happy and I just can\u2019t wait to get started and meet all the lads and get cracking on,\u201d Berahino told stokecityfc.com. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything to happen but I got a call from West Brom telling me I was free to speak to Stoke. I was the happiest man on the motorway driving up here this afternoon.\u201d Hughes said the playmaker Bojan Krkic has not expressed a desire to leave Stoke. The Spaniard has started only six games this season and has been linked with a move to Middlesbrough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
