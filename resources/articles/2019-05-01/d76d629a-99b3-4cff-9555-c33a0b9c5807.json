Messi scored twice to bring up a staggering 600 goals for the Spanish champions, 14 years to the day since his debut goal for the club. His second of the game \u2013 an incredible free-kick swept into the top corner of Alisson\u2019s goal from distance \u2013 gave Barcelona a 3-0 advantage that Klopp accepted would be difficult to overturn in Tuesday\u2019s second leg at Anfield. Liverpool can consider the scoreline harsh. Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah missed excellent chances to change the complexion of the tie but their manager, while proud of the performance, admitted there was no answer to Messi. \u201cIn these moments he is unstoppable,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t defend the free kick. What a strike. \u201cThe second goal was probably not the nicest in the career of Lionel Messi but it shows his skills that he is even there in that moment. Apart from that I was happy in how we defended the whole Barcelona team. I am a big admirer of them, as is everybody, but my boys didn\u2019t show too much respect, they were there every time. \u201cWe played football and I liked that. I knew before that Lionel was a world\u2011class player and now I saw it again I am not too surprised.\u201d Ernesto Valverde, the Barcelona coach, said his team \u201chad to suffer for the clean sheet\u201d but the free-kick left him lost for words. \u201cMessi always surprises you,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it. He also does it in times when we need it. We gained some breathing room with his runs to their penalty area when we needed it.\u201d Messi, however, cautioned against over-confidence. \u201cWe know that it is not decided,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have to go to a very difficult stadium, but we are very happy.\u201d Defeat was Liverpool\u2019s first in 20 matches and their first in five visits here. It was also their fourth away defeat of the Champions League campaign but Klopp insisted it was their best performance on the road in Europe this season. \u201cI am not sure if we deserved a lot more than we got,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played a really good game but in the end they scored three and we didn\u2019t score. \u201cAs a manager, what I judge on is how we played. I am completely happy and proud of the boys, it was the best Champions League game we played not only this year but last year as well. How we defended, how brave we were in these situations, how we were when we got the ball. We were not always brilliant but we controlled the game in moments and created. Maybe not constantly chances but we had moments. \u201cNo one will be interested but a few football nerds because it is about the result and we lost 3-0, but I can work really good with this game. I will use it for ever to show the boys what is possible. It was a brave performance, very passionate, very lively. I liked the game but it doesn\u2019t really help.\u201d Klopp was realistic in his assessment of Liverpool\u2019s prospects for the second leg, admitting there was still hope, albeit incredibly slim without an away goal. \u201cBecause it is football, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before this game we had a bigger chance, let me say it like this. It is difficult. It is Barcelona and they can play for counterattacks, which doesn\u2019t help us a lot. \u201cBecause it is football we should still try but it didn\u2019t make our life easier tonight. It is not the night to be mouthy and saying it is exactly what we wanted, that if we score an early goal and all that. It will be another really difficult game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
