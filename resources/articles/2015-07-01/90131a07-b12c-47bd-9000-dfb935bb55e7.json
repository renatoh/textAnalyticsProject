The first thing to note is how remarkably confident, perhaps even omnipotent, the Tories must be feeling, post-election. Here they are, attempting to undermine an act that a majority of the British public wanted. These would be ordinary people, who wouldn\u2019t care if, for instance, prior to the election, prominent Tories stood on faded rugs, in grand houses, secretly promising amendments/\u201cstealth\u201d repeals (however they wish to term it), should they get in. Nor is anybody accepting this \u201cyou townies don\u2019t understand countryside folk\u201d guff anymore. I grew up in the countryside. I wandered around bluebell woods as a child, dodged horse muck in the roads. I know what a stile is and that dyke has another meaning apart from being slang for lesbian. I climbed into disused piggeries with my friends and stared at walls stained rust-coloured with blood and at holes in the floor, where pigs were thrown after slaughter. I didn\u2019t just pop to the country for a cream tea and a bracing inhalation of manure \u2013 I grew up there and knew people of different classes and ages (as you do, in the country). Yet I never knew anyone who hunted, was pro-hunting, fitted in any way the tally ho caricature or who complained about townies not understanding their way of life, in the manner of straw-chewing yokels straight from central casting. This has always been the first fallacy \u2013 that the countryside is different. As I\u2019ve written before, no, it isn\u2019t, not really, and certainly not where being exempt from the law is concerned. On this note, are the persistent complaints about hunt-law flouting going to be (finally) addressed in parliament this week? Here\u2019s a suggestion I\u2019ve made before: if hunts are confident that they\u2019re law-abiding, why don\u2019t they simply allow representatives from animal charities to join the hunts to confirm that the rules are being upheld? Let\u2019s clear up some other \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d. I keep hearing about \u201cwildlife management\u201d (pest control, disease, protecting vulnerable species, biodiversity). It all sounds very civilised and lovely in a Born Free kind of way. However, if it\u2019s about keeping numbers down, what explains this business about foxes being bred for hunts? Moreover, with wildlife management, who decided that the best way forward was a pack of (slathering, wound-up) dogs and what amounts to a fancy dress party on horseback? As for the somewhat fatigued \u201ctradition\u201d argument: some people used to enjoy cockfighting \u2013 should we bring that back too? It seems to me that this much-vaunted love of tradition comes and goes, and rather arbitrarily too. Then we come to the craziest pro-hunting argument of all \u2013 that it\u2019s not just about toffs, there\u2019s a \u201cmix\u201d of people doing it. Well sorry, it is about toffs, people who delude themselves that they\u2019re toffs, or pathetic types who crave the company of toffs (need it be pointed out yet again that just the price of the kit is prohibitive?). Even if there is a \u201cblend of different people\u201d, who cares? Would crowds at an illegal dogfight be meticulously perused to check that there was an agreeable enough class mix? Toffs, plebs like me (and possibly you) \u2026 it\u2019s irrelevant. Not only is foxhunting a cruel, unacceptable throwback practice, the vast majority of citizens have made their dislike for it clear. If the Conservatives promised a select group that they would push through this amendment, and will now attempt to do so, what is this if not brazen contempt for British people? To repeat, the government has to accept that this is a law that the public is actively, emotionally invested in. Openly, or by stealth, it will not be repealed so easily. Why is there all this stick for the selfie-obsessed? Every so often, famous people, who by definition are photographed a lot, express dislike for selfies. Benedict Cumberbatch called selfies \u201ca tragic waste of engagement\u201d. This echoes Cannes film festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, who branded them \u201cridiculous and grotesque\u201d. Obviously selfies can be highly irritating, but the constant criticisms are also starting to grate. If selfie sticks cut out tourists needing people to take snaps of them, where\u2019s the real harm? And while some people become worryingly addicted to selfies (we\u2019ve already seen your toned tummy \u2013 it\u2019s very nice, now please put it away), for others, it\u2019s akin to harmless self-papping \u2013 either as a celebrity lark (as with the Ellen DeGeneres Oscars selfie) or as a way for a non-celebrity to feel special for a moment. Perhaps sometimes it\u2019s healthier. At least selfie-takers seem happier to be their own personal celebrity rather than obsessing over red carpet strangers. So, yes, selfie-culture can be annoying, even toxic at times (there\u2019s a trend for taking selfies in dangerous situations). However at least these people are taking themselves seriously, rather than fantasising over famous people they don\u2019t actually know. Billionaires wed \u2013 what\u2019s not to love? James Rothschild of the banking dynasty has just married Nikki Hilton of the hotel dynasty. Tatler must have spontaneously combusted in all the excitement \u2013 just a damp sooty patch and a pile of staples left. By rights, this news should make oiks such as myself want to throw up into a bucket, but, as it happens, they are so ridiculously rich that it becomes rather funny. I\u2019m imagining the wedding guests being forcibly dipped in gold and rolled in emeralds as they arrived. Specially trained doves scattering \u00a350 notes into the crowds. In fact, I\u2019d quite like to have gone. Nice day out, bit of hobnobbing (\u201cCiao, Nat, old bean\u201d), I would have fitted in a treat, until they found me stuffing my bra with the tiny packets of Love Heart sweets you always get at weddings. It makes perfect sense for a Rothschild to marry a Hilton. As part of a billionaire dynasty, it must get stressful trying to find someone who isn\u2019t after you for your money. Let\u2019s face it, most of us would be. Then, one member of a billionaire dynasty locks eyes with a member of another billionaire dynasty and magically all doubts are washed away, as if in the slipstream of one of those tacky-looking super-yachts that wealthy people are always trailing about on, faces like smacked backsides, looking as bored and horrified as though they were enduring a leaky tent in Skeggy. Mind you, maybe this theory doesn\u2019t work. Arguably the rich are the most avaricious of the lot (explaining how they got rich); they are built for greed. So, despite being incredibly rich, there\u2019s a high probability that they would still marry for money. One hopes such issues (\u201cAre you marrying me for EVEN MORE money?\u201d) didn\u2019t spoil the happy day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
