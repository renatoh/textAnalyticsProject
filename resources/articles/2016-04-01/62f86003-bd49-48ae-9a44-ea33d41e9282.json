Lots, it turns out. There\u2019s her husband Jason, carrying on with another woman and unwilling even to join Marcella in breaking the news of their separation to the kids. There\u2019s those kids, estranged from their mother as a result of a spell in boarding school \u2013 or perhaps something more traumatic. And there\u2019s her anger issues, threatening to spill over at any time (this week during an incident with a police bathroom bin) and likely to bring with them those damaging blackouts. But Marcella\u2019s biggest problem by far is the corpse she\u2019s just discovered in a forest clearing: Grace Gibson\u2019s corpse in fact, with her head wrapped, like so many victims before her, in a plastic bag. That Grace\u2019s sudden disappearance would be resolved with the discovery of her dead body was always a possibility if not a probability, but linking her to the Grove Park murders was a nicely macabre twist, one that suggests that, if nothing else, Marcella (both the show and the character) is likely to keep us on our toes. While I can\u2019t shake the sense that the whole thing is a bit ludicrous, it\u2019s at least proving entertainingly ludicrous. Detective. Witness. Suspect So then, what about that Grace Gibson business? I think we can safely rule Marcella out as the perpetrator, if only because the alternative would either suggest that she\u2019s a) the Grove Park killer or b) some sort of copycat killer, both scenarios which seem a bit too ridiculous, even in this age of morally murky detective protagonists. At the same time, we know, from those \u201cabsent fragments\u201d that came back to Marcella en route to the woods, that she was at least involved in a violent altercation with Grace at her house. Might she have inadvertently softened Grace up for her eventual killer? And how did she know to head to the woods in the first place? Whether or not Marcella\u2019s culpable for Grace\u2019s death, she\u2019s in a lot of trouble. For a start, she\u2019s all over the CCTV footage outside Grace\u2019s house in the hours before her disappearance. She also managed to place her grubby fingerprints all over the bag around Grace\u2019s head (though I wonder if the writers intended that as a moment of high drama rather than a telling plot point). Fortunately, in times of stress, Marcella\u2019s got someone to run to. Unfortunately, that person is Tim, a DI and former colleague who\u2019s now looking into Grace\u2019s disappearance. Marcella and Tim share an intimate moment at hers after he reveals the news of Jason\u2019s infidelity, but he chivalrously rebuffs her advances. When Marcella isn\u2019t traipsing desperately around the woods or sidling up to co-workers on the sofa, she\u2019s got actual detective work to do. The victim of the Grove Park killer\u2019s latest bagging has been found by the police, and has been named as Benjamin Williams. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been another attack, this time a botched one, with the assailant forced to flee after getting stabbed in the shoulder with a pair of scissors. Marcella remains certain that the culprit is Peter Cullen, despite a direct order from her superiors to stop treating him as the prime suspect. Her decision to bring Cullen in for questioning demonstrates exactly the sort of maverick tendencies we love to see in our lone-wolf, primetime TV detectives. Unfortunately it\u2019s undermined by the fact that she hasn\u2019t actually formally charged Cullen with anything, meaning that he doesn\u2019t have to answer any questions, let alone take off his shirt and reveal his shoulder. Besides, even if Marcella had managed to make Cullen get his top off, she wouldn\u2019t have found much, because \u2026 Also under suspicion It\u2019s the baker who\u2019s the butcher! Cullen\u2019s boss Guy was always likely to be a wrong\u2019un from the moment we saw him absconding from duty as Cullen\u2019s supervisor. (Quite why a baker has been handed the task of keeping watch over a man convicted of manslaughter, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but let\u2019s go with it.) The nasty gash on his shoulder merely sealed the deal. So should we now consider Guy prime suspect in the hunt for the Grove Park killer? And is Cullen being set up as a patsy for Guy\u2019s misdemeanours? Or is Guy his acolyte, with Cullen pulling the strings from a safe distance? Certainly, I\u2019m unwilling to rule Cullen out any time soon, given what we know of him. He seems to have designs on Maddy, the postgraduate student observing him for her study on \u201cdomestic violence that results in death\u201d. \u201cHe trusts me,\u201d she tells Marcella when confronted over her involvement with Cullen. Tread carefully, Maddy. Goings on elsewhere Grace\u2019s disappearance prompts further fissures in the Gibson mob\u2019s fragile facade. This time it\u2019s Jason and Grace\u2019s step-brother Henry at each other\u2019s throats, after Henry \u201clets slip\u201d to the police that Jason and Grace have been having an affair. Jason\u2019s menacing stare when he confronts Henry over this admission will no doubt be grist to the mill for those commenters who fancy him as the Grove Park killer. (As noted by several of you, he was wearing leather gloves similar to the killer\u2019s in last week\u2019s episode). Then again, a fairly prominent ITV whodunnit did the whole \u201chusband of the detective being the killer\u201d thing fairly recently, so I\u2019d be disappointed if that was the ultimate reveal. Meanwhile, because this show clearly doesn\u2019t have enough subplots competing for space, a new couple are introduced: Yann and Matthew. They\u2019re friends of Henry, and both have problems. Matthew\u2019s a skint computer whizz who\u2019s sleeping in the back of a Volvo, while Yann\u2019s a recovering alcoholic with a gift for being completely tactless. He manages to be deeply insensitive towards Henry, responding to the news of Grace\u2019s disappearance by relaying the story of Grove Park victim Carol Fincher\u2019s grisly unearthing. (He was in the same AA meetings as her \u2013 let\u2019s get him on the suspect list and all!) Yann should probably stop cracking wise and start paying attention to what\u2019s going on with his boyfriend: there\u2019s clearly a frisson of l\u2019amour between Matthew and Henry, one that\u2019s only likely to become more pronounced now that Matthew has accepted a job offer from Henry. Finally, Cara attracts the unwanted attention of the killer, after the trinkets she half-inched from one of her dating app trysts turn out to be the very same \u201ctrophies\u201d stolen from the Grove Park victims. Might that point the finger of suspicion in the direction of Clive Bonn, unseen this week, but who we know frequents the murky world of internet dating? (Seriously, why is this show so down on internet dating?) Whoever it is, they\u2019re firmly on Cara\u2019s trail, confronting her digitally via webcam and getting her to do all manner of business with a kitchen knife. I surely wasn\u2019t the only one expecting a masked figure to pop out just as Cara was getting to the pointy end, but fortunately for her that wasn\u2019t the case. Still, she shouldn\u2019t be too complacent: the killer is busy scouring the web for her location. Tread carefully, Cara. In fact, tread carefully everyone. It\u2019s a dangerous place out there in Marcella-land. Notes and observations Marcella\u2019s terrifically spooky theme tune is a track called Fall by moody electronic lot The Bug. A couple of details alluded to this week that will surely become significant down the line: Marcella\u2019s psychiatrist makes reference to three past instances of her violent behaviour, including one concerning \u201clittle Juliette\u201d. Meanwhile Marcella refers to the \u201cHexton case\u201d, which seems to have been quite traumatic. Marcella\u2019s diagnosis of Cullen is too funny not to repeat. \u201cAn unstable self-image. He shifts rapidly between emotional states and often demonstrates intense rage that\u2019s out of all proportion with the case. Dominant traits: an intense fear of abandonment and an inability to handle rejection\u201d. Sound familiar? While Cara\u2019s housemate suggests the London of Marcella is big enough for her not to encounter her webcam menace, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s pretty tiddly: everyone in the show seems to know each other, despite being in completely different social groups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
