I screwed up the admin, and now his much-loved 16-year-old Skoda Fabia faces obliteration. Given that I am the only child of two only children, both deceased, and that one of my 3am woodpecker threnodies of grief has been that my family has been wiped from the face of the Earth, I suppose that\u2019s fitting enough. Mourning, as you see, can be melodramatic. Because, in fact, I am nested in another family, huge and hugely loving, have stalwart friends falling over themselves to help, and plenty of material and practical resources to face the obstacles before me. Checking my privilege would require a long and detailed stock-take. It doesn\u2019t always feel like that in the early hours. Then, loss can seem like an isolation cell in which days, objects and sensations blur into one another in disorientating and befuddling fashion. A few hours that might have contained some productive work, a nice dinner, lipstick, chatter, red wine and the feeling that, \u201cactually, it\u2019s OK, I can do this\u201d, abruptly recede and the mind is filled with the poetry of Sylvia Plath: \u201cI am the centre of an atrocity.\u201d But back to the Skoda. I had been driving it even when my dad was still alive, to and from the hospital, to the next-door Sainsbury\u2019s for more pyjamas and tissues and soft jellies and \u2013 God almighty, the hubris \u2013 to buy a cheap tablet that I hoped he might recover enough to watch football and cricket on (he never did). When he died in March, I knew I couldn\u2019t keep the car indefinitely; I mostly live in rural Ireland and when I stay in London, have no real need for it. So I managed to pull off a self-deception \u2013 like all the best ones, with a grain of truth to it \u2013 and told myself it was useful to keep for now. For popping down to Dad\u2019s flat, to clear it out, to ferry things to charity shops and friends, and (near-unbearable thought) to the rubbish dump. Except I couldn\u2019t bear to do that quite yet either, and there it sat, the clock ticking as its motor tax ran out. And then, quite unexpectedly, there it didn\u2019t sit. At first, I thought it had been stolen \u2013 presumably by joy riders who found it an easy mark, because who would want to nick a 16-year-old Skoda in a street filled with far smarter cars? I wandered up and down the road, thinking I must have forgotten where I had parked it (the amnesia of grief or menopause, take your pick). No dice. And so I reported it to the police, who, after a few days, responded that in the absence of any evidence, there was so little chance of finding it that they would not be pursuing the case. I put up a mild resistance: could it not have been picked up on CCTV? But unless I could narrow the time of its disappearance down to a 20-minute window, they countered, they didn\u2019t have the resources to investigate. The end: and after some particularly vicious inner monologues (\u201cYou didn\u2019t stop him dying, and you couldn\u2019t even look after his car\u201d; \u201che loved that car, and you lost it\u201d, \u201che kept a photograph of Mum on the dashboard\u201d, and so forth), I moved on. So I was taken aback when a police officer called earlier this week. Your Skoda, he said. Not stolen, removed. No tax. Here\u2019s the number to call. Actually, he gave me the wrong number, and in any case, it was the first of many people to call. The car pound, the DVLA, back to the police on some point of clarification. Never, ever, through to the right person on the first go; a hell of automated menu options; quite often a mere instruction to fill out a form. All my fault. I had an idea that the tax ran out at the end of June. But in fact it was the MOT that had expired during the car\u2019s incarceration. The authorities had written to warn about the tax, and sent the letter to my dad\u2019s flat. Yet you knew he was dead! I pleaded on the phone. But I had told the wrong department. OK, I said, but I\u2019m in touch now. Can I pay the tax and get the car? Well, they said, of course you can. If you can pay the release fees and the storage charges that you had no idea you were racking up, which now exceed the car\u2019s value by a significant margin. Be kind to yourself, people say when you\u2019ve been bereaved. You\u2019ll be very tired (I am; shattered, save for weird bursts of manic energy). You\u2019ll feel you should be getting on with things but you might not always be able to; you mustn\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s quite normal. But the people who say these kind things do not, sadly, make the rules. And the rules, even more sadly, do not stipulate that major life events deserve an amnesty in which you might be so focused on keeping your shit together that you will louse up the paperwork. How could they? For all I know, I was the hundredth person to ring up with a dead dad and a sob story that day. That mine is true is immaterial. And so, ultimately, is the little blue Skoda. He won\u2019t need it again. After a few days of tears and general existential crisis, I\u2019ve picked up a bit and rowed back on the self-pity. \u201cYou know all this pain\u2019s about your dad, not the car,\u201d said my partner, very gently. Yes. Yes, I do. But sometimes, it\u2019s easier to think about the car. \u2022 Alex Clark is a writer for the Guardian and Observer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
