They treat me with deference. The body is disposable - it'll be buried or burnt. The only thing that makes me laugh is when people tickle the soles of my feet. I believe that all through my life I have had my mother as my good angel. She is still very much here with me. And what other people may call coincidences are to me miracles brought about by the good hand of my mother. My mother is a woman who gave up her life so I could have mine. I wanted to be a fighter pilot, but I couldn't. So after the war I thought to myself that I should have lessons in a Tiger Moth. My friend Dick Emery bought a monoplane for himself for \u00a370. And I had a plane as well. We had great fun. We had a dogfight over Guildford. At one point, I pretended that he shot me out of the air... I did a spin down towards Guildford Cathedral. I was so fascinated, I almost forgot to pull up. I have a lot of acquaintances but only a few friends. Just a handful, in fact. Jesus Christ was an alien from another planet. I wrote a book once called UFOs Are Coming Wednesday. I firmly believe in flying saucers and I believe that they are curious about us. For most of my life, I have lived in my head. My most precious and otherworldly creations have kept me in a very retrospective frame of mind. I was summed up in a report by my headmaster once. He described me as someone who was 'scatterbrained' at school. I guess that just about concludes it. No one decides to be a comedian. It's the audience that makes comedians. I don't know what age you stop caring about sex. I haven't got there yet. I worked in the golden age of light entertainment. We were the first people to ever have our work recorded on film for future generations. We happened to be lucky enough to be the first as writers, comics and cameramen. And that's amazing, because in a hundred years' time, people will be able to look at it all. The man who leans over the farmyard gate and watches the Rolls-Royce go by with jealousy is in need of a life. The man who leans over the farmyard gate and watches the Rolls-Royce go by - only to look back happily at his humble farmhouse - well, he has the secret to life. Growing old means that someone like me is allowed to fall asleep in an armchair without anyone raising an eyebrow in protest. I cannot speak with knowledge about women - they are a totally different species. Thank God. Laurel and Hardy have inspired me my whole life. When I was in the cinema as a boy, there was often a buzz or a ripple through the crowd. Their comedy was full of innocence. They broke all the rules of cinema. You're never supposed to look at the camera - they looked at it all the time. What we have now are just abstract heroes. A man is never too tall to stoop to help a child. Show business is these days too naked to the outsider. Too many people are allowed access into the inner circle. I have the belief that the backstage area should be unknown to the public. The prompt corner, the apron, the pit: they should all be foreign terms to the ordinary punters. People don't often want to take responsibility for their actions. That's not necessarily a new development. Basically, we're all cowards. The stage is a world of magic when the curtain goes up from the dark to the light. A good comedy is worth 12 months on the National Health Service. And people who specialise in the craft of comedy should never forget that. My favourite joke. Two Irishmen are standing on either side of a river. The first one says: 'How do I get to the other side?' The other replies: 'You are on the other side.' My friends are developing the nasty habit of disappearing for good. I have fewer friends these days than I used to. I suppose that naturally happens when one reaches the eighth furlong in life. \u00b7 Eric Sykes stars in Stan The Man, 4 November, ITV1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
