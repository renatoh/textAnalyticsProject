He's also an acquired taste. In some respects, he's temperamentally akin to DH Lawrence: a dark, mystic sensualist who peers beneath the crumbling veneer of civilisation in search of primal, archetypal experience. His heady lyricism, swaying and unfurling rather like Lawrence's incantatory prose, is something you either can or can't take. I've always found him a tad self-indulgent. However, Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, closing a concert of Polish music with his Third Symphony, made the best possible case for Syzmanowski. Subtitled The Song of the Night, the Third is a setting of Sufi poetry for tenor, chorus and a colossal orchestra. Written during the first world war, it marks a turning away from contemporary events towards a world of sexual and spiritual introspection. The tenor meditates on the \"ecstasy\" of being \"alone with God\", but his ecstasy is primarily erotic, as percussive throbs and string undulations gradually build to seismic climaxes during which the chorus interject raucous, wordless cries. Szymanowski's orchestral palette is opulent and kaleidoscopic, an unremitting display of tone colour that owes much to Scriabin's Poem of Ecstasy and Stravinsky's Firebird, though it surpasses both in its range. Davis seemed not so much to conduct it as to fling himself into its world with delirious abandon. The choral singing was rich, if in places a bit staid. The tenor, Paul Groves, combined dreaminess with athletic virility. When it was over, I felt I needed a cold shower. Witold Lutosklawski admitted to feeling giddy when he heard Szymanowski's Third. His own music, composed under the communist regime and later equated with the voice of Solidarity, inhabits an altogether different terrain, that of the artist searching for individuality in the face of totalitarianism. The Concerto for Orchestra was the work that made him both a national and international success in 1954. Its brilliance is deceptive, compounded of a folksy melodic and rhythmic drive and dissident atonal harmonies. Davis couldn't quite disguise the fact that the closing passacaglia goes on too long, though the opening movement, in which a defiant, lurching theme ricochets from the depths of the orchestra to its heights, was electrifying. In between came Chopin's Second Piano Concerto, with Maria Joao Pires as soloist. She defies criticism in this music, probing it with the combination of supreme intelligence and emotional spontaneity that is uniquely her own. In the slow movement, the audience held its breath as the slow cascade of sound unfurled with perfect limpidity. Chopin's orchestration has often been criticised as weak. Davis avoided the usual tendency to make it sound as if it was written by someone else (many conductors shade it towards Brahms), unearthing some beautiful woodwind and brass sonorities in the process. The BBCSO's playing had a ferocious energy throughout the evening, communicating the orchestra's almost tangible delight at having its former chief conductor back."}, "isHosted": false}}}
