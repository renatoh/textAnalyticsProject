PSG\u2019s manager watched his team collapse in Catalonia last season, a 4-0 first-leg lead overturned when Barcelona scored three times in seven minutes to win 6-1 but he insisted PSG are better prepared to face Real Madrid. His centre-back Marquinhos, meanwhile, called for \u201ccourage and personality\u201d in a match that is likely to be partly played in the mind. Emery was late to the pre-match press conference and when he got there, he did not say much, his answers short, lacking his normal loquaciousness and rarely conveying the confidence he repeatedly said he felt. He said PSG found \u201cmotivation\u201d in facing the \u201cchampions\u201d and \u201c12-times winners,\u201d a status he insisted on more than once. Another word he returned to often was \u201copportunity\u201d but this is an obligation, too. PSG must overcome what happened last season in the last 16 \u2013 first psychologically and then on a pitch on which they chose not to train. \u201cWe preferred the privacy; we have been doing that often this season,\u201d Emery said. If that felt like a means of escape and isolation, there was something of that in the way the PSG manager spoke as he largely evaded answering questions about the mental impact of last season\u2019s defeat. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be on their mind,\u201d the Real Madrid full-back Marcelo said but surely something remains, some scar, and Emery did eventually say: \u201cMaybe the preparation for this match started in that game. \u201cIt gave us an experience that we now want to make positive. We have spoken about that. Not much but very clearly. In moments like that, in those circumstances, you can learn a lot. We are better prepared and ready to compete at this level.\u201d Marquinhos said: \u201cIt was two games; one of the best and then the worst of the season. We have to learn from that and the lesson has to be that we impose our identity away from home as well as at home, with courage and personality.\u201d In the summer PSG spent \u20ac400m on two players as they sought to break through that barrier, including Neymar, who led their destruction at the Camp Nou, but much of the noise in the build-up has been about the Brazilian departing for Madrid. Marcelo said: \u201cMadrid fans like players who are good and he is a world star and any fans would want him.\u201d His presence for PSG increases their chances, of course, but it also increases the pressure on him and his team. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s nervous,\u201d Emery said. Madrid, too, are under pressure as is Zinedine Zidane, whose side are 17 points behind Barcelona in La Liga, but Europe has so often proved their elixir. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about my future, I am only thinking about tomorrow\u2019s game,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cI can\u2019t control those other things; what I can control is what we are going to do on the pitch. Games are important for me; my future isn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know who has more pressure. We don\u2019t have any in the sense we\u2019re happy to be able to play these games. We live for these matches. As for them, you\u2019ll have to ask PSG.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
