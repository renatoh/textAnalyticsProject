To make matters worse, Torres and Steven Gerrard both picked up injuries to heap further pressure on Rafael Benitez. Without the inspiration of their two best players, Liverpool were clueless against lowly opposition who had enough chances to win the game in normal time. The defeat means Liverpool have been knocked out in the early rounds of both domestic cup competitions, plus the Champions League, leaving the club to concentrate on finishing in the top four. And the Europa League. Champions League football next season remains uncertain and their ability to compete among the Premier League's elite will be called into question once more after the latest defeat. Liverpool have maintained that Ben\u00edtez, who signed a new five-year contract last year, is not under threat, but will tonight's result \u2013 and performance \u2013 change that? And what of Reading? Unlucky not to win the first game at the Madejski Stadium, they were well worth their victory, showing terrific character to battle back from an own goal to equalise through a penalty in the 90th minute, before Shane Long sealed a famous Cup upset. Given the way they managed to raise their game, just why do they find themselves one place above the drop zone in the Championship?
