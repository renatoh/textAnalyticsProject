But every now and then, FOI cases emerge that are so patently bizarre, they warrant special mention. We\u2019ve gathered a list of four of the most perplexing decisions this year, to give a sense of just how underwhelming FOI can be. 1. China\u2019s likely view of our foreign interference laws is off-limits, department rules Foreign affairs is always a tricky topic to illuminate with FOI. Documents affecting the relations with a foreign state are kept from the reach of the public by Australia\u2019s Freedom of Information Act. So it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that an FOI request for documents about the impact of Australia\u2019s foreign interference crackdown on relations with China was not particularly successful. But the release is particularly galling for the heavy use of redactions. The censors didn\u2019t leave a single word, other than a few inconsequential subheadings and dates, in this six-page document release. 2. Coal and climate change not matters of public interest? One of the most prohibitive aspects of FOI is the cost. Apply for documents, and you will almost certainly be charged a fee. It\u2019s often not a lot, maybe $200, but it\u2019s just enough to deter shrinking newsrooms and smaller not-for-profits, who can\u2019t risk wasting money on a request that may prove useless. To get past fees, media agencies routinely rely on having them waived because the material is in the public interest. It doesn\u2019t always go to plan. In one recent case, Australian Associated Press argued the government ought to release documents on Australia\u2019s support for a new coal mine in Papua New Guinea because coal was linked with higher emissions and climate change, a matter of clear public interest. The journalist argued: I contend it is both in the general public interest and in the interest of a substantial section of the public for these documents to be released. Climate change is a huge problem facing the world. There is a link between coal and carbon pollution emissions. There is a huge public debate in Australia under way about energy security and the role of coal in the future. I contend it is both in the general public interest and in the interest of a substantial section of the public to know if the Australian government is supporting efforts to set up the first coal mine and coal-fired power plant in PNG. The argument failed to convince the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It decided the fee must be paid and charged $200 to process seven documents. Again, just enough to deter reporters with shrinking newsroom budgets. So AAP took it to the tribunal. It didn\u2019t take the tribunal long to decide that coal and climate change were, in fact, matters of public interest. Significant public interest, in fact. It appears access to the documents would contribute to the public record on an industry that is at the forefront of public debate and is regularly in the media, namely coal mining in and by Australia. I find that access to documents concerning coal mining activities in Papua New Guinea, our nearest neighbouring nation, has significant public interest. 3. Arms exports to the United Arab Emirates You\u2019d be hard pressed to argue Australians shouldn\u2019t know what and how many weapons our government is supplying to the United Arab Emirates, a country engaged in the bloody Yemen war. The United Nations has accused the coalition led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia of killing thousands of civilians in airstrikes, torturing detainees, using child soldiers and raping civilians. The defence department was asked for details on Australia\u2019s arms exports to the UAE. The released documents were so heavily redacted that they were practically useless, unless you know precisely what you are looking for. Of the 110 pages released, every one is almost entirely redacted. Defence argued releasing the information \u201cwould or could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations\u201d of Australia. Other parts of the information would reveal deliberative processes of the government, exempt under the FOI Act, or that it would or could have a \u201csubstantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of an agency\u201d. 4. Records of Crown\u2019s VIP gambling flights a \u2018risk to public safety\u2019 The Age investigative journalist Chris Vedelago placed a well-targeted request to Airservices Australia two years ago, seeking access to the flight records of Crown\u2019s VIP planes, which it uses to ferry high rollers. He had every right to be confident of success. Precisely the same records had been released by Airservices Australia twice in the past, without issue. But after contacting Crown, Airservices Australia decided that releasing the records would threaten the safety of passengers, because would-be conspirators would use the documents to predict flight patterns and place patrons at \u201chigher risk of interference and so put them and or crew in danger\u201d. It was a strange argument. As Vedelago noted: As clearly demonstrated by 2013 and 2014 releases, Crown flies to and from dozens of destinations in multiple countries on dates and times that demonstrate no pattern of routine. He appealed the decision to the information commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, and the Airservices decision was overturned without equivocation. But the process of application, review and appeal took 18 months, an eternity in journalism. Vedelago requested the documents on 22 November 2016. They didn\u2019t come through until 4 May 2018."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
