Unfortunately, they all wanted to talk to me about direct debits. I thought the curse of the \"chuggers\" was mostly over. But oh no. Tuesday night the door bell rang, and the rep from the British Heart Foundation started his spiel. Wednesday, reps from Age Concern were everywhere. I dodged the first, only to be assailed by a second. At the station they jumped out again, pleading with me to \"just talk\" to them. They are the charity equivalents of squeegee merchants, spraying moral guilt over our personal windscreens. It is a wretched way for charities to raise cash. The organisations employing the chuggers are not charities, but often private, profit-driven concerns. Most of the first year's direct debit cash goes straight into their coffers. Charity marketing people seem to think that as long as they make something out of every \u00a31 given, it's better than nothing. It's not. It's much better, financially and morally, to give through workplace-based \"give-as-you-earn\" schemes allowing you to donate from gross salary, boosting the amount the charity receives. Donors also have rather more time to contemplate which charity they think should benefit, rather than falling for the \u00a312-an-hour spiel from chuggers. I doubt if these smiling young adults rattle a tin at my local station early in the morning, as I see RNIB and Christian Aid volunteers doing. They get \u00a30 an hour. Now that's charity. When did we allow shops to set the rules on how long an electrical product should last? Take an item back to the shop which has malfunctioned after a year - even if you're just looking for a repair - and the assistant will effectively tell you to get lost. \"It's out of warranty, mate\" is about the best you'll get. But while a shop or manufacturer is perfectly free to set a warranty period, it should be entirely irrelevant to your rights. After all, they could set six months, nine months, 18 months or whatever. Why should those dates limit our rights to return something that was not of merchantable quality in the first place? Which? asked manufacturers how long their electrical products should last. In general, the answer was four to five years. Unfortunately, the law on returning goods is ambiguous at best. The Sale of Goods Act - which says that goods must last a reasonable time - is not explicit. EU rules suggest that our rights extend to two years. But Department of Trade &amp; Industry guidelines say you can pursue relevant claims for up to six years after a purchase. But quite what \"relevant\" means is not that clear, either. Fortunately we have a dynamic new head of the Office of Fair Trading, John Fingleton. He's already ordered credit card companies to cut penalty charges to \u00a312, and is now slogging it out with the banks to make them fall into line. When the job's done, can he please turn to consumer rights on returns? p.collinson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
