But logic sometimes takes a back seat in India. I have witnessed England's past two tours of India from both sides of the fence - as a player in 1984-85 and as a hack in 1992-93 - thereby viewing the expedition from vastly different perspectives. On both trips the cricket often defied logic. The 1984-85 tour was ultimately successful and always eventful since it encompassed two assassinations, a general election and a bio-chemical calamity in Bhopal. But let us focus on the cricket, as we hope to be able to do in the next six weeks, in an attempt to find a way forward for Nasser Hussain and his team. Had I been a scribe in 1984-85, I expect I would have delivered gloomy prognostications of England's chances. Like today there were significant absentees from the touring party. Ian Botham opted for a winter off, while Graham Gooch and John Emburey, the most notable South African 'rebels', were serving their bans. The sages in the press box stressed how impotent the team would be because of these absences. But this was a factor that never occurred to the players once our plane had taken off from Heathrow, and that's how it should be. Not once - not even after a thrashing in the first Test in Bombay - did anyone mumble: 'If only Both was here.' We regarded the tour as a self-contained expedition and once it had started no thought was given to what might have been. Cricketers, unlike journalists, do not think like that. Moreover, several of us owed our places to the absences of more established players. We felt fortunate to be there. Contrast that with the 1992-93 tour, Keith Fletcher's first as England manager. Gooch was persuaded against his better judgment, but in deference to his old mate, to lead the side. His reservations soon became obvious and affected the tone of a hugely disappointing tour. There are pointers here for the current tour. India is no place for reluctant tourists and we must now assume that England do not possess any of those. Just as in 1984-85, Hussain and his men have in their favour low expectations and therefore a reservoir of sympathy from the travelling cognoscenti as well as their supporters back in England. There's not much to lose and plenty to gain, especially for Richard Johnson, Jimmy Ormond, Richard Dawson and Martyn Ball, who must all be slightly bewildered that they are required to muster at Heathrow on Tuesday. Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick won't warrant a mention in the dressing room once the team are in India. But a positive frame of mind alone will not be enough to prevail. There will be a tricky balancing act for the England think-tank to perform, especially when they try to work out how they can bowl out India. They must assess their own strengths, which, despite the inexperience of the chosen trio of Hoggard, Ormond and Johnson, still lie with their pace bowling rather than their spinners, while taking into account the playing surfaces in Mohali, Ahmedabad and Bangalore, the venues for the three Test matches. In 1992-93, the seemingly omniscient triumvirate of Fletcher, Gooch and Gatting got it horribly wrong before the first Test in Calcutta. India named three spinners in their side, the surface was bare and cracked, and England picked four seamers plus Ian Salisbury because the finger spinners, Emburey and Tufnell, were not bowling very well. This mistake, which betrayed how rapidly the management were swayed from their pre-tour strategy - remember how Salisbury was initially in India only as a net bowler - was one from which the tour party could never recover. But it is just possible to understand why they made this mistake. Five of England's previous six victories in India had stemmed from their pace attack. In 1976-77, John Lever and Bob Willis were the architects of three consecutive wins; in 1979, Botham ran amok, taking 13 wickets in the one-off Jubilee Test in Bombay; and in 1984-85, Neil Foster took 11 wickets in Madras. The other victory in Delhi in 1984-85 came about via Indian carelessness on the final day and a certain amount of dissension in the opposition camp - Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev were barely speaking to one another. England may hope that similar divisions surface in the Indian team after a draining tour of South Africa. England must also hope that the conditions in Mohali in the north retain their usual characteristics, namely that they are more favourable to pace bowlers than elsewhere in India. England's trio of pacemen may be raw but they still represent the best chance of victory. Foster was only 22 when he grabbed all those wickets in Madras, three years younger than the current batch even though he already had more Test caps to his name than Hoggard, Ormond and Johnson put together. All three of these pacemen have attributes similar to Foster: they bowl at lively, rather than express, pace and have the capacity to swing the ball away as well as extract occasional surprising bounce. These are essential qualities on pitches where the ball is unlikely to seam. All three have suspect injury records, so England must hope that at least two of them are fighting fit when the first Test begins on 3 December, especially since their one spinner of experience, Ashley Giles, is unlikely to be match-fit by then. So here's a strategy of sorts. England must hope to snatch a victory via their seamers in the first Test in Mohali and then hang on for dear life against an increasingly jaded Indian side. Once the ball starts spinning, as it assuredly will in the last two Tests, Anil Kumble and Harbajhan Singh will have the measure of England's spinners, who will not worry Indian batsmen in their own backyard. Then it is time for Hussain to win the toss for a change and for his batsmen to bat for the first five sessions of the match. Simple, really.
