A year after a disillusioned, uncharacteristically cowed Pardew defected to Crystal Palace, Newcastle are third bottom of the Premier League and McClaren is fighting to not only keep his job but convince Mike Ashley, the club\u2019s owner, of the need to modify recruitment policy. Last week the former England coach, who has remained commendably calm and measured since succeeding John Carver last summer, sat in front of television cameras and issued a relentlessly positive message regarding his team\u2019s prospects at Arsenal on Saturday. Shortly afterwards, McClaren moved to a changing room a few yards down a training ground corridor for a more informal chat with newspaper reporters and, finally, the mask slipped a little. \u201cI\u2019ve been here [in a relegation fight] before, I never liked it and I still don\u2019t like it,\u201d said the 54-year-old. \u201cIt frustrates, annoys, angers, disappoints. But it\u2019s no good doing nothing about it. We\u2019re working hard to change things; we\u2019re keeping plugging away. We\u2019re going to stick it out and fight.\u201d If McClaren cannot be entirely confident of persuading Ashley and his lieutenants to break their rules on signing players aged over 26 in order to introduce some much needed experience and leadership, he has at least identified a tactical survival strategy. Once it became clear Newcastle lacked the calibre of midfielder required to fulfil his initial possession-based blueprint he reverted to Pardew\u2019s old counterattacking game. He hopes this will be a temporary measure but trusts it can help transform Newcastle\u2019s season. \u201cIt\u2019s only half-time,\u201d he said, turning optimistic again. \u201cI\u2019ve had many a nightmare first half of a season but then the second half\u2019s been terrific and a big turnaround. That\u2019s the kind of thing we need \u2013 and expect. \u201cWe always said it would be difficult. The evidence said work needed doing here. I think everyone knew that at the beginning and certainly everyone knows it now. All I can say is we\u2019re prepared to do the work and I never become a pessimist.\u201d Even so, McClaren acknowledges that adverse results have, at times, sapped morale. \u201cSapping is a good word,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to try and get away from, we\u2019ve got to keep the mentality strong, keep taking the positives.\u201d After the disappointing collection of a solitary point from festive fixtures against Aston Villa, Everton and West Brom, it has not been lost on Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy that he endured sticky starts to his tenures at both Middlesbrough and FC Twente, the clubs where he enjoyed the most success. For his part, McClaren is adamant that Newcastle is not quite as dysfunctional as it often appears. \u201cThere\u2019s some really good people behind the scenes here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re different to some people at other places who can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people here really want to make a success of this. There\u2019s a lot of hard work going on behind the scenes which isn\u2019t necessarily showing but, hopefully, in the second half of the season it will.\u201d Last month Pardew revealed that he was \u201cbeaten down\u201d by both Newcastle\u2019s internal politics and the \u201cemotion\u201d surrounding the club, but McClaren has not yet reached that point. Instead he has cautioned that relegation will loom should the board fail to sign a forward this month. \u201cAt the moment Aleksandar Mitrovic is our only fit striker,\u201d he said, pointedly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
