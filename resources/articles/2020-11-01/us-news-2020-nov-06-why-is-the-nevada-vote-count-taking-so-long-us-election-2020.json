But government officials say they are emphasizing accuracy over speed in a year when processing an unprecedented flood of mail-in ballots under extended deadlines is taking more time. \u201cWe told everyone early on that results would take at least 10 days,\u201d Secretary of State spokeswoman Jennifer A. Russell said in an email. How it started The Legislature passed a bill in August to send all active voters mail-in ballots in hopes of curbing, or at least not fueling, the spread of the coronavirus. Those postmarked by Election Day can be counted if they arrive at election offices within seven days, which is Tuesday. And they continue to come in, though the number arriving each day is expected to dwindle. \u201cIt\u2019s been a different year for us,\u201d said Deanna Spikula, registrar of voters in Washoe County, the state\u2019s second-largest county that includes Reno. \u201cThe volume is definitely something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the state as far as receiving and processing mail-in ballots.\u201d Where we stand The Associated Press has not declared a winner in the state. More than 1.2 million ballots had been counted by Friday afternoon, with Joe Biden holding a 22,657-vote lead over President Donald Trump \u2014 an edge of about 1.8 points. About 87% of the estimated vote has been tallied, but tens of thousands of votes remain uncounted statewide. The vast majority of those untallied ballots are in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and its populous surrounding suburbs. Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria said on Friday that outstanding votes fell into several categories, each requiring multi-step verification to ensure the integrity of the election. The process Most of the still-to-be counted ballots arrived by mail, and are first processed through a machine that verifies signatures. Election staff manually examines signatures not verified by the machine. Later, a review is done to make sure the total number of ballots processed matches the number of ballots received. Once verified, those ballots are counted. As of Thursday, an additional 44,000 ballots required ID verification, and 2,100 others had signature-match problems. The registrar\u2019s office reaches out to voters in both groups to verify their eligibility to vote, which again takes time. The timeline Gloria said he expected the majority of the remaining ballots to be counted by Sunday. The Legislature gave election officials until November 12 to finish counting votes, and Gloria said staff intended to work until then to resolve ballot issues. In Washoe County, the registrar\u2019s office said it had no backlog or other problems with vote-counting. Along with counting mail ballots as they arrive, the county has about 5,100 provisional and same-day registration ballots that need to be counted. About 1,800 others have signature issues, which the agency is attempting to resolve with the voters. Processing mail-in ballots takes longer, but \u201cwe haven\u2019t had any hiccups, we haven\u2019t had any delays,\u201d said spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale. \u201cAs much as everybody wants an answer right now, we won\u2019t have that until every ballot is counted,\u201d she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
