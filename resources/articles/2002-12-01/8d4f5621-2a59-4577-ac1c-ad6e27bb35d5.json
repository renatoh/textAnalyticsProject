A number of bidders are circling Allders, but management has agreed in principle to an indicative cash offer of about 160p a share with Minerva, the property group. It is possible that Minerva could agree to join forces with Green, allowing both sides to divide the spoils. Allders pre-tax profits fell 45 per cent from \u00a314.4 million to \u00a37.8m in the year to end-September. Empty threats The Government is to launch a crackdown on Britain's 753,188 empty homes. Local authorities will now be able to borrow money from banks to renovate them so housing associations can rent to key workers. Owners of empty properties, defined as being vacant for six months or more, will be encouraged to volunteer properties into the scheme. But if voluntary measures fail Housing Minister Lord Rooker has confirmed he will introduce compulsory leasing within two years. Rooker believes that if the Government is to convince the public that it needs to build more houses it has to tackle what he regards as a scandalous waste of the nations' property resources. There is, he said, no question of appropriating ownership. The scheme ties in with government moves to raise council tax for people with second homes and expand commercial freedom for high-performing local authorities. New Dome homes Meridian Delta, the consortium chosen to develop the Greenwich Dome site, is to increase the number of homes it will provide on the peninsula in a bid to win backing from London Mayor Ken Livingstone. There will now be 10,000 homes built on the 200-acre site - an increase of 3,000. The consortium - comprising Lend Lease, the Australian retail giant, Quintain, the property group; and US firm Anschutz Entertainment Group, is scaling back the commercial office element of the scheme. It will submit plans in two weeks for an 'arts, entertainment and media cluster'. M&amp;S deadline Hopes that M&amp;S would clinch the sale of its US supermarket division, Kings, this weekend were fading fast as the deadline for the buyer to raise the finance expired yesterday evening. New York-based grocer D'Agostino was given from the end of July until midnight, East Coast time, yesterday, to fund the agreed $160m acquisition. 'I would not bet any money on them finding the finance,' said a City retail analyst from a leading global bank. 'M&amp;S wants to sell Kings in the long-term for structural reasons but now the balance sheet is healthy again there is less pressure.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
