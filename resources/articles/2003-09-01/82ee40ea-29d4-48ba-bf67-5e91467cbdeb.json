Haim Saban, the Israeli-raised entrepreneur best known for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers shows, said he would make an approach within weeks if the competition commission clears the \u00a34bn merger of Granada and Carlton. And Mel Karmazin, the boss of Viacom - the company behind MTV, Paramount and CBS - has also threw his hat into the ring publicly by declaring an interest, as long as the conditions are right. Trade secretary Patricia Hewitt will announce within two weeks whether the proposed merger between the ITV giants can go ahead. But Mr Saban warned today he would not be interested in investing \"one dollar\" in ITV if Ms Hewitt forced Granada and Carlton to dispose of their advertising sales houses. If the ruling is positive, Mr Saban said he would take \"a couple of weeks for internal studies\". This, he said, would be \"followed by a meeting with Charles [Allen, chairman of Granada] and Michael [Green, chairman of Carlton]. Speaking at today's Royal Television Society Cambridge convention he said he would start looking at the network in detail on October 8th - two days after Ms Hewitt is expected to make her announcement. But he ruled out a deal with the venture capitalists Apax, with whom he had been rumoured to be planning a bid. Mr Saban said his company, worth \u00a36bn, was too big to be involved in what he called \"small deals\" and the number of opportunities which came along in Europe to buy a market leader were rare. Mr Saban is said to have a personal fortune worth $1.7bn and recently spent $500m buying ProSiebenSat1 from Kirch in Germany. \"We got into Germany. The next country we're going to look at, starting October 8, is the UK,\" he said. Mr Saban was unequivocal, however, about what he called the \"insanity\" of running an ITV network which did not have ownership of its advertising sales arm. \"You control the cash out and have no control of cash in. It is absolutely insane. It has no hold in commercial reality. We will not invest one dollar in ITV [if the proposition is ITV without sales houses],\" he said. \"It's like saying to Marks and Spencer 'you can merge with Selfridges; you can buy all the merchandising in the store but when it comes to the cash register you give it to someone else.' It's insane,\" he added. Mr Saban called on regulators to \"lift off the shackles\" because ITV in its present form is \"a declining asset\". He said unless changes were made to \"an old and archaic system\", the UK would be left with just one dominant terrestrial broadcaster, the BBC. Pressed repeatedly, he referred once again to what he believes to be an insurmountable obstacle - the threat hanging over the sales houses. \"That is a shackle that drags you down to the bottom of the ocean and we don't need to look any further. \"It's insane; you are asked to invest in programming; to do public service; pay the government; but have no control over the money that comes against this,\" he said. Mr Karmazin, Viacom's chief operating officer, said he was less concerned by the prospect of not owning the advertising business of ITV. He said his company would be willing to adapt to the business model thrown at them, but made it clear he would not be deciding on a bid until he knew what he was being asked \"to play for\". Viacom is already a major player in UK television as the owner of Nickelodeon, Viacom Outdoor advertising and the MTV network which accounts for a third of the company's profits. \"We have made no bones about our strong desire to expand in the UK; it is a very important market for us; we want to make it a more important market. \"But we have to understand what ITV is going to look like,\" he said. The declarations of interest by Viacom and Mr Saban will fuel fevered speculation about the future of ITV under a possible American owner. New legislation allowing non-EU companies to buy ITV was given royal assent in July after a fierce battle in the House of Lords, where rebel peers lead by Lord Putnam mounted a campaign to stop foreigners taking over what they consider to be the crown jewels of British broadcasting. Today both Mr Saban and Mr Karmazin sought to assure regulators in the RTS audience that they would not tamper with programming. Mr Karmazin said he would leave all programming decisions to local management and would increase the marketing and programming budgets. Mr Saban rounded on those who criticise potential American buyouts, saying \"They know that we are not going to replace Coronation Street with The Bold and the Beautiful (a US daytime soap). \"[the idea that] bringing American dollars into British television is going to affect British culture is total and utter nonsense,\" he added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
