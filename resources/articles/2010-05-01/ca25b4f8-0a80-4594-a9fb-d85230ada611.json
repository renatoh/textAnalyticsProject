Odd really, because the previous few months had delivered a number of gifts for David. May's general election had presented his Conservatives with a historic swing. Even better was his strategic masterstroke of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, an alliance that had done more in just a few hours than the previous five years' rebranding to shift the Tory party towards the centre ground. Yet all that felt years in the past now. Why? Well, it came down to the same subject that had shaped politics ever since 2007: the economy. Yes, the Age of Aquarius that excitable commentators had declared back in May (something to do with sun-dappled lawns at No 10 and an unbuttoned informality in leadership) had been replaced with an Age of Austerity. David and George had flagged this up years before the election, as had the Lib Dems \u2013 but the message was never popular with voters and had been muted during the actual campaign. And so, when they came, the biggest spending cuts since the war came as a complete shock to the public. Pointing out that they had been implicit in the Conservative election manifesto did not go down brilliantly. The cuts began well enough. On day two of the new era (AD as it was now called in Whitehall: After Dave), it was announced that ministers would take a 5% pay cut, on salaries that would be frozen for the next five years. This was jolly popular, but at cabinet level that saved only tens of thousands of pounds. Then came the emergency budget, which was not as bad as had been advertised in advance. It was a ragbag of easy spending cuts (New Labour boondoggles, pet projects of former junior ministers) and some tax rises. Then it got harder. In all, 2010 had four major budget announcements: the last budget from Labour, then the emergency headline-grabber \u2013 followed by an autumn statement and a comprehensive spending review. And it was the last two that really brought the pain. When it came to fiscal policy, the coalition had a colour-coded approach: blue spending cuts (on the scale and timetable set by the Tories) and yellow tax changes (largely hitting those bits of the code favoured by the Lib Dems, such as raising capital gains tax). The two together spelled big trouble for a fragile economy. When the coalition took over, the UK economy was in the middle of a tepid recovery. The biggest motor of growth was the public sector; and the kind of rebalancing that all politicians hoped for \u2013 away from the City and towards a more diverse economy \u2013 had failed to materialise. Ordinarily, any government would have deferred cuts until a sustainable private-sector recovery came along. But that was economic logic; what won out in cabinet discussions was political logic. A new administration had to get out as much bad news as possible, as quickly as possible, which meant jacking up VAT to 20% and taking the axe to public services. Unions did not like it, but David blamed Gordon Brown for leaving a hideous mess. He pointed to the crisis in Greece and wheeled out Mervyn King as a kind of defence counsel. Trouble was, the UK was now reliant for growth on a mini-boom in financial services, and on exporting to those same crisis-hit European economies. By winter, the economy was suffering a major relapse and the unions were threatening a latter-day general strike. Meanwhile, businesses were complaining about tumbleweed on the high street \u2013 hardly surprising, since shoppers were worried about keeping their jobs. And the rating agencies were now threatening the UK with a downgrade on the grounds that its economy was so weak. David had other things to trumpet about his government's first year, but all was overshadowed by one term: double-dip recession. So no, not a vintage Christmas. And the real worry was that 2011 did not look much better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
