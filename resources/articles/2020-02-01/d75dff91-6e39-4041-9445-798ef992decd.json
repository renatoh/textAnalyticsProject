The more than 70,000 fans who attended the country music star\u2019s 22 February show at Ford Field understood it for what it was: a tribute to one of greatest NFL running backs and Detroit Lions players ever. Brooks told the audience that he donned Sanders\u2019 No 20 jersey to pay homage to him since they both went to Oklahoma State University. \u201cI was lucky to go to school with him,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cYou guys got the greatest player in NFL history, in my opinion, in this jersey. I love this man.\u201d After the show, Brooks posted a photo on social media of himself wearing the jersey, which has \u201cSanders\u201d and \u201c20\u201d emblazoned on the back. That\u2019s where the trouble started. Annoyed fans ripped Brooks in the comment sections under the photo, believing he was endorsing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the self-proclaimed democratic socialist\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cI had no idea you were a big freaking liberal socialist! I\u2019ve listened to your songs for the last time!\u201d one person wrote. Another wrote, \u201cIf this is for Bernie Sanders, I\u2019m done with you. I thought you were a true American that loves our country.\u201d Others, though, pointed out the apparent confusion over Brooks\u2019 post or made fun of those who read too much into it. \u201cHow much did KFC pay you to wear this?\u201d a commenter wrote, referring to another famous Sanders: Colonel. There\u2019s no indication of who Brooks supports politically, though he performed at former Democratic president Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration. The widely adored Brooks also has a track record of songs that were regarded as too progressive for country radio, most memorably 1992\u2019s We Shall Be Free, a call for racial and LGBT tolerance. The music video for the song, written in response to the Rodney King verdict, included footage of riots, the Ku Klux Klan, flag burnings and dozens of celebrity cameos and was deemed too controversial for television after NBC promised to air it before Super Bowl XXVII \u2013 which prompted Brooks to walk out of his scheduled pre-game performance of the national anthem unless the network agreed to air it. (NBC relented and Brooks performed.) Bernie Sanders hadn\u2019t weighed in on the matter as of Friday afternoon, but the Hall of Fame running back took it in stride, tweeting his fellow OSU alum, \u201cHey @garthbrooks, want to be my VP? #Number20For2020.\u201d Brooks responded in jest, \u201cI would run any race with you! #Number20for2020 HA!!!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
