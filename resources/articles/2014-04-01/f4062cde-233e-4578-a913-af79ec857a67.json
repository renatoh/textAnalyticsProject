But there is also a growing suspicion this weekend that the veteran entertainer may be putting down his microphone simply in order to slip into his dancing shoes. Brucie, as he been affectionately known for at least the past 40 years, is famed for his love of \"hoofing\", or traditional tap dancing, and has been tempted on to the dance floor several times during his 10 years on Strictly. Bookies William Hill cut the odds of him taking to the dance floor as a contestant from 100-1 to 25-1. At 86, the performer would certainly be pushing his body if he took up such a challenge, and other commentators have suggested he is unlikely to want to take part in such taxing live shows any longer \u2013 especially as a contender. When the BBC announced his decision on Friday it was emphasised that Forsyth still plans to be involved with the show. He will present the Christmas Special and various other one-off programmes, including Children in Need. Charlotte Moore, controller of BBC1, paid tribute to the host's role in making a success of the show and said she was pleased that he \"will continue to be part of the Strictly family\", promising viewers that \"we haven't seen the last of him on BBC1\". Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill, said that while he could not see Sir Bruce competing, there were clearly a lot of people prepared to bet on it in the first few hours following the BBC's announcement. \"It would certainly make great telly,\" he added. An early leader among the candidates for sliding reverently into Forsyth's place on the show was Claudia Winkleman, who took over the job at short notice last year when he suffered a bout of ill health. But overnight much of the betting money has migrated towards comedian Graham Norton, the chatshow host and one of the BBC's most prized light entertainment presenters. According to Ladbrokes, the 51-year-old Norton is odds-on favourite. Spokeswoman Jessica Bridge said: \"Brucie's retirement has been on the cards for a while, but the odds firmly suggest that Graham Norton will waltz his way into presenting Strictly Come Dancing.\" According to these betting figures, Winkleman, 42, who presented the spin-off show Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two between 2004 and 2010, now has odds of 3-1 on taking the reins as the main show's next host, along with Tess Daly, 44. Professional dancer Anton du Beke is also a possibility for the coveted role on the dance show. Adams at William Hill said that Winkleman's stint as a stand-in had worked well, but that Du Beke was also a growing popular hope. \"Anton is a massive favourite with Strictly's legion of followers,\" he said. Speaking for rival betting firm Coral, Nicola McGeady said the dancer was even more popular with her customers: \"Following today's breaking news, money has rushed in for Anton du Beke taking the reins as the new host of Strictly Come Dancing.\" Coral has made Du Beke favourite to replace Forsyth, at 15-8, followed by Tess Daly's husband Vernon Kay at 2-1 and then Winkleman at 5-2. While a husband and wife team comprising Daly and Kay would have a certain appeal for viewers, the bookies have also given the Doctor Who and Torchwood star John Barrowman billing as a potential new host at 7-2. Bookies Paddy Power have Du Beke as their favourite at 7-4, followed by Norton and Barrowman, both at 9-2. There has been no big vote so far for Darcey Bussell, the former Royal Ballet dancer who joined the judging panel when Alesha Dixon left, or for Arlene Phillips, the 70-year-old creator of television dance troupe Hot Gossip, who was unceremoniously removed from the judging panel in 2009 in favour of Dixon. It is testament to the power of the show under Forsyth's reign that a number of judges who were initially newcomers to television have become stars of enough stature to be considered now for the host's job. Forsyth, who started out in entertainment at the age of 14 with an act called the Mighty Atom and became the host of Sunday Night at the London Palladium at 30, went on to become a household name for generation after generation of television viewers with shows such as The Generation Game, Play Your Cards Right and The Price is Right. This, Forsyth said, was by no means the end of that road, though. \"I am looking forward to the specials planned with the BBC, as well as some live theatre shows, so before anyone asks, I am not retiring quite yet,\" he explained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
