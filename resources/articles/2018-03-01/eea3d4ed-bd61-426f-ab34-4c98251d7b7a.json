On Tuesday the federal court ruled in favour of Rush\u2019s legal team\u2019s application to have all of News Corp\u2019s truth defence and large portions of its qualified privilege defence struck out. \u201cNationwide News and Mr Moran sought to justify only a few of the defamatory imputations,\u201d said Justice Michael Wigney in his judgment summary. The difficulty was their defence was \u201cplainly deficient\u201d, he said. \u201cThe main sting\u201d of the defamatory imputations they sought to justify was that Rush sought to engage in \u201cscandalously inappropriate behaviour in the theatre\u201d and had \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d a female actor during a production of King Lear. But multiple questions about the specifics of the incident were not answered by the particulars, Wigney said. Wigney also set aside a Nationwide News subpoena for the Sydney Theatre Company, labelling it a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d. Rush launched defamation proceedings against the News Corp subsidiary, Nationwide News, and reporter Jonathon Moran over articles published last year in the Daily Telegraph which alleged \u201cinappropriate touching\u201d of a female colleague during the Sydney Theatre Company production. Defence documents released last month said Rush touched the cast member in a way that made her feel uncomfortable while carrying her on stage during a performance. Rush is also accused of following his co-star into the women\u2019s toilet and standing outside her cubicle until she told him to \u201cfuck off\u201d, at a party to celebrate the end of the production. Wigney also struck out three paragraphs of the defence\u2019s qualified privilege defence, saying they \u201cdid not raise a reasonable defence, were ambiguous, and were likely to cause prejudice and delay in the future conduct of the proceedings\u201d. Australia\u2019s qualified privilege defence in defamation requires a publisher to show the allegedly defamatory articles were in the public interest and that it acted reasonably. Wigney said the defence\u2019s subpoena for Sydney Theatre Company appeared to be a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d looking for material that might support their defence. \u201cA publisher who pleads justification must do so on the basis of the information it has in its possession when the defence is filed,\u201d said Wigney. In February Rush\u2019s legal team successfully had part of News Corps defence documents suppressed after arguing it contained \u201crumours\u201d which would \u201cfurther damage\u201d his reputation. The media company said it did not make any allegations in its published articles that Rush \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour of a sexual nature\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
