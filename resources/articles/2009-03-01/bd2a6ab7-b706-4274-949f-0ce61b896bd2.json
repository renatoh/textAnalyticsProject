There were no immediate reports of damage. \"Sea level readings confirm that a tsunami was generated. This tsunami may have been destructive along coastlines of the region near the earthquake epicenter,\" the US National Weather Service's Pacific tsunami centre said. The Hawaii-based Pacific tsunami warning centre issued a tsunami warning for Tonga and neighbouring islands, and reported that sea level readings have confirmed that a potentially destructive tsunami wave has been generated. The quake struck at 6.18pm GMT at about 130 miles (200 km) south-southeast of the Tongan capital of Nuku'Alofa at a depth of 6.2 miles (10km), the US Geological Survey said. One Nuku'Alofa resident, Pesi Fonua said the quake \"lasted for something like 20 seconds,\" but \"I haven't seen any damage from it.\" Local radio stations in Tonga broadcast warnings that a tsunami was possible and that people should move away from coastal villages, but police and locals said no big wave had been reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
