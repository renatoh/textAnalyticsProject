But, this being the Olympics, there are some formalities to take care of, not least the fact that eight other countries are competing, two of which are determined enough and good enough to upset predictions that the curling tournament is a two\u2011team contest between the hosts, Canada, and the favourites, Britain. If there was any doubt about that before, there can be none after today's opening session, which saw Murdoch's squad beaten 6-4 by Sweden while Martin and his men were taken to extra ends by Norway before winning 7\u20116. Being beaten at this early stage is an occupational hazard for an Olympic curling skipper rather than cause for panic \u2013 Britain's Rhona Martin lost four times in the round-robin stage at Salt Lake City in 2002 and still went on to win the gold \u2013 but it was the manner of Murdoch's defeat rather than the defeat itself that will have been troubling. To put it at its kindest, the Scot was outplayed by his opposite number, Niklas Edin, the reigning European champion who, at 24, is the youngest skipper in the tournament. Murdoch took a 1\u20110 advantage at the end of the second end but ceded the lead in the third and never recovered as their opponents skilfully controlled the contest. \"It's becoming pretty standard for us in these championshipsto lose our first match,\" he said. \"We let them off a little bit but we are not going to beat ourselves up.\" The British team will be back on the rink tomorrow for a match against a weaker French squad and know that nothing less than victory will do. They will know, too, that the mood in this tight, atmospheric curling venue is the purest distillation of Canadian patriotic fervour. \"We like it when the crowd is against us. It spurs us on,\" Murdoch has said in recent days. It is just as well. As fate would have it, the Scot and his Canadian counterpart played their matches yesterday on adjacent sheets \u2013 close enough to keep an eye on each other, close enough to know that the early advantage has now fallen to the hosts and close enough to know now that the expectation that they are destined to meet in the final in 10 days is premature. The Swedes could spoil everyone's fun. Still, lovers of sporting theatre and simmering sporting feuds will have their moment on Saturday evening. \"I think we play them the night of the 20th, don't we?\" Martin said the other day, which suggested he was either the only man in Canada who did not know when his squad is scheduled to play the Britons or that he was indulging in mind games. The smart money is on mind games \u2013 as it always is when these two meet. \"We get on well with Kevin's team. We have good banter both on and off the ice,\" says Murdoch. \"They are great guys. We get along, we are friends,\" says Martin, adding that during a trip to Scotland he called his rivals to organise a game of golf. Alas, the game of golf never happened \u2013 the consequence perhaps of busy men failing to find space in a busy schedule? Or possibly something else? Sources within the curling community hint the answer is \"something else\", that for all the public pronouncements of camaraderie, the relationship between the two teams is as frosty as the Olympic rink itself. Given the competitive history between the skippers \u2013 they have played each other in the last two world championship finals, winning one each \u2013 it would be surprising if anything else were the case. Yet there is also a little extra needle involved, not between Martin and Murdoch directly but with Martin and the British curling community. The enmity dates back to 1991, when the Canadian was playing another Scot,David Smith, in the world championship final and changed broom during the game. The new broom was drier and scattered debris across the sheet, making it harder for his opponent to play his stones accurately. \"Bloody cheater,\" Smith muttered \u2013 an epithet that was picked up by television microphones. It was an unfair charge, although the rules were changed soon afterwards, making it illegal for players to change brooms mid-game. Murdoch was a teenager at the time but his \"second\" in Vancouver, Pete Smith, was a member of the 1991 team. \"Of course I know the story,\" he says with the intonation of a man who believes there is still a score to settle. He will get his chance on Saturday at least. The question after today's defeat is, will he get another chance when the final comes around?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
