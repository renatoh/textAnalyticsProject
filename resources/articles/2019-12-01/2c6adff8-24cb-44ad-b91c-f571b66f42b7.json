The unsung TV gems of 2019", "bodyText": "Guilt In a sea of interchangeable crime dramas, all dead girls and doom-ridden detectives, Neil Forsyth\u2019s Guilt felt like a breath of fresh air from the BBC. The story of two brothers in Edinburgh \u2013 smooth lawyer Max (Mark Bonnar) and hapless record shop owner Jake (Jamie Sives) \u2013 whose lives are turned upside down after a car accident, Guilt was a joyful mixture of pitch-black one-liners, sharp plotting and clever performances. This was crime drama the way it should be: free of gimmick and filled with well-drawn characters \u2013 most notably Bonnar\u2019s Max, who increasingly commanded the screen as his carefully managed world spun beyond his control. Best of all in this overstuffed era, Guilt didn\u2019t outstay its welcome, unfolding in four perfectly paced episodes and ending in an unexpected and quite exceptional betrayal. A triumph. SH Mum I\u2019d always been on the fence about Mum, Stefan Golaszewski\u2019s BBC sitcom about a widow (Lesley Manville) beset by annoyingly selfish relatives in her big old family house. It always seemed a bit pleased with itself, and almost cruel in its cartoonish depiction of all those buffoons. But season three, turbocharged by setting its action across a week rather than months, made the first two runs look like a mere warmup. The emotional payoffs came far more frequently, and all the characters\u2019 vulnerabilities poured movingly out. At its centre, the courtship between Manville\u2019s Cathy and Peter Mullan as her late husband\u2019s besotted friend Michael provided several moments so gloriously romantic you wanted to reach in and hug them both tight. When it properly bared its soul, Mum revealed itself to be a treasure. JS The Other Two At first glance, The Other Two, which was about a 13-year-old pop sensation and his two loser siblings, had the air of a dire US comedy destined to be repeated on E4 for the next 10 years. But despite its unpromising premise, seemingly dislikable characters and obvious parallels between protagonist ChaseDreams and Justin Bieber, it was a spiky, satirical gem about the realities of being an also-ran. Penned by former Saturday Night Live head writers Sarah Schneider and Chris Kelly, The Other Two was like a junior 30 Rock, each line peppered with pop culture references, including a long-running gag about Justin Theroux\u2019s motorbike-shaped toilet. But it tackled bigger themes, too, like alcoholism and homophobia \u2013 fixed, of course, by Chase penning a song called My Brother\u2019s Gay and That\u2019s Okay! HJD Zomboat! Don\u2019t say they didn\u2019t warn you. That exclamation mark in the title functioned as advance notice from ITV2 of Zomboat!\u2019s daffy intent. Indeed, how you feel about excessively jolly punctuation may have determined whether you got on board with this Birmingham-set zom-com or not. I\u2019ll confess I was sceptical: it felt like the channel that has been screening Shaun of the Dead on loop for over a decade had spontaneously spawned its own baby TV version, Jurassic Park-style. But thanks to winning performances and a perfectly absurd conceit \u2013 four ragtag survivors flee the undead apocalypse in a Rosie and Jim-style narrowboat that moves only fractionally faster than the hordes of biters who stagger down the towpaths in pursuit \u2013 Zomboat! had genre smarts, chum-buckets of charm and a genuinely killer theme tune. Although perhaps it speaks to our apocalyptic times that hanging out with panicky smart-mouths besieged by flesh-eating zombies felt something like self-care. GV Everybody in the Place: An Incomplete History of Britain 1984-1992 Jeremy Deller\u2019s documentary on rave culture was shown twice; both times on BBC Four, both times in the middle of the night. But for people of a certain age, it was still unmissable. This was not just an impeccably curated portrait of a point in time; Everybody in the Place looked at rave anew. This was partly the result of Deller\u2019s inquiring mind: the Turner prize-winning artist has a fascination with unofficial history and folklore, and saw it at work in Shoom or Hardcore Uproar. But he also has a passion for collaboration, and it was choosing to present his story to a classroom of 2019 schoolchildren that turned this show into something special. The children saw something for the first time, just as Deller was revisiting it, and the way their responses differed but also chimed at points was truly poignant. PM Giri/Haji A perennial problem with \u201cheavyweight\u201d BBC drama, apart from its fixation on murders and lakes, is that it feels obliged to follow certain tried and tested rhythms and protocols. Joe Barton\u2019s Anglo-Japanese thriller, refreshingly, had a cadence that made it feel more like a foreign arthouse movie. Telling the story of a Tokyo cop, Kenzo Mori (Takehiro Hira), sent to London in search of his lost gangster brother, and co-starring the drily excellent Kelly Macdonald as a London-based cop and Will Sharpe as an Anglo-Japanese gay rent boy, Giri/Haji kept you watching because you had absolutely no idea in which direction it was headed but were very willing to find out. As well as the development of the emotionally torn Mori, exquisite touches included the use of animation as a means of exposition \u2013 a method also used in 2018\u2019s Black Earth Rising. Giri/Haji deserved a lot more watercooler conversation than it got. DS Back to Life Darkly comic and crushingly grim, this show, co-written by and starring Daisy Haggard, tackled the stigma of life after prison head on. Haggard played a thirtysomething woman, Miri, returning to her claustrophobic childhood town in Kent after being released for what, it became apparent, was a deeply troubling crime \u2013 prompting her neighbours to hang an effigy in her garden and graffiti her fence. Haggard played Miri with buckets of the compassion that those around her so obviously lacked. And there was an impeccably placed cast of supporting characters: Adeel Akhtar as the unlikely and endearing boy next door, Richard Durden as Miri\u2019s emotionally stilted father, and Geraldine James as her steely mother. Haggard and co-writer Laura Solon built an utterly convincing world, and took a delicate look at the attempt to rebuild a life that had been on hold for half of its existence. AK Teen Titans Go! I love Teen Titans Go! with all my heart. I could write thousands of words about how it, rather than Joker, has been the real left-turn of the DC universe; about how its lack of continuity \u2013 and willingness to kill its main characters \u2013 has kept it fresh; how the voice cast, returning from a cancelled former version of the series, have found entire new characters in their old characters; how I can relate to Robin\u2019s default mode of screaming, insecure, ego-driven stress more than any other character on television; and about how the Working on an Episode song from the 200th episode special is the perfect encapsulation of modern work. More than anything, though, it just makes me laugh. Unfailingly. Not bad for a kid\u2019s show. SH The Cockfields As a panel show comedian, Joe Wilkinson specialises in sustained oddness, his deeply offbeat shtick designed to give you the creeps as well as tickle you. It\u2019s a persona that bestowed on The Cockfields \u2013 Wilkinson\u2019s Isle of Wight-set dramedy, in which he starred as eminently sensible everybloke Simon \u2013 an instant novelty value: who knew the man could be so normal? It was not the show\u2019s only surprise, as Simon brought his girlfriend Donna (Diane Morgan: sweet, smiley, decidedly off-brand) home for his 40th birthday celebrations. What first appeared to be a cosy slice of domestic farce \u2013 a Gold sitcom with a heritage cast (Sue Johnston, Bobby Ball, Nigel Havers) \u2013 turned out to be a knotty family portrait bristling with resentment and disgust. Channelling the stifling mundanity of a Mike Leigh film, Wilkinson and his co-writer David Earl recreated step-family dynamics and cloying parental behaviour with an accuracy so uncanny you wondered if they\u2019d been bugging your family home. A gut-punching piece of TV that deserved to have more people shuddering in recognition. RA After Life Post-Extras, Ricky Gervais went nasty. In his standup and Golden Globes gigs he aimed his abuse both upwards (\u201cTake that, Hollywood!\u201d) and down (\u201c\u2026 and you, fat people\u201d). Yet from this soup of toe-curling viciousness came a starting point for redemption. In After Life, Tony (Gervais) is angrily disillusioned with life after the death of his wife. So this time, in contrast to Gervais\u2019s regular controversy-baiting, the abusive diatribes had a rationale: his character\u2019s depressive nihilism. With help from a sterling supporting cast, including Ashley Jensen and a snarling David Bradley, Tony lost the bitterness and learned to live again. And if you\u2019re feeling generous, so too did Gervais. DA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
