By which I don\u2019t mean detained, to be slaughtered at a later date by a wicked throne-craving uncle (though, personally, I\u2019d keep an eye on that Andrew after he\u2019s had a few). Rather that they\u2019re stuck in a royal-themed Guantanamo, with stately piles instead of orange jumpsuits, but still no hope of escape? Is this what Harry was alluding to when he gave his Newsweek interview, saying that no royal (including William?) wanted the crown, but that \u201cduties would be carried out\u201d when the time came? To which one possible response could be: \u201cNow don\u2019t go putting yourself out, love,\u201d while others must remain unprintable. As it happens, I have some sympathy for multi-kazillionare feudal landowners William and Harry. They didn\u2019t ask to be princes, they didn\u2019t go on a television talent show and belt out some Mariah Carey number to win Being Royal. It was their (tainted) birthright. The relentless intrusion must be foul, and Harry makes a fair point about how he (and by extension, William) shouldn\u2019t have been put through walking behind his mother\u2019s coffin in front of the gawping millions \u2013 which, in retrospect, does come across like a grotesque, nationally-sanctioned form of child abuse. However, the gist of Harry\u2019s interview, implying that he and his brother are trapped in their roles, doesn\u2019t stand up to serious scrutiny. You don\u2019t have to go that far back in history to come across a king who decided that the crown wasn\u2019t worth the faff, and legged it. Perhaps, in a quiet moment, the princes could ask nana Liz just how her father, George VI, came to be king after his brother, Edward VIII, fell for an American divorcee and abdicated. (The Queen could leave Uncle Eddie\u2019s admiration for the Nazis, and the mysterious stiff salute he taught her as a child, for another time). The point being that no one is forced to remain tied to the monarchy. Harry could dial back his royal duties, including all those tiresome-looking pool parties and extended holidays, and get himself into full employment. William could refuse the throne, saying that he wishes to pursue his dream of helping with the Middletons\u2019 online party supply shop (\u201cI have an idea for a Nicholas Witchell pi\u00f1ata!\u201d). The ensuing constitutional problems would be dramatic but, frankly, after Brexit, no biggie. There\u2019d be plenty of time to deal with the succession during Charles\u2019s reign, even if it did come down to Camilla standing in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, yelling through a megaphone: \u201cCome on, who wants the gig next? It\u2019s a drag visiting factories, and the smell of new paint makes you gag, but it pays well.\u201d All this facetiousness leads to the point that, away from the red-carpeted navel-gazing of the princes (Less \u201cWho am I?\u201d than \u201cWho is one?\u201d), there are many ways for far less affluent, connected, celebrated people than William and Harry to feel truly trapped in this world. There are people trapped in poverty, with ill health, in abusive situations... the list sprawls on. People who, even in this developed nation, genuinely feel that they have no options, no way out at all. And while it\u2019s incredibly sad that people feel this way, the real tragedy is that, in this era of welfare cuts aimed at even the disabled, they\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s a feeling of hopelessness that even extends to the young, some of whom may genuinely feel that their only chance is to go on a television talent show and belt out some Mariah Carey. That\u2019s why, even though few of us would wish to swap lives with the princes, they\u2019ll never be as trapped as some. If, as they seem to suggest, they\u2019re existing in a gilded cage, then at least the door is always open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
