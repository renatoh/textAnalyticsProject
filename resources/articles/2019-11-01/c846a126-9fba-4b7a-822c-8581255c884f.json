In place of the prime minister, Channel 4 placed an ice sculpture, representing, they said, the emergency on planet Earth. A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part. The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case. Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence. The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate. Johnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d. The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050. The expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed. Si\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted. \u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry. Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d \u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon. The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper. \u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said. More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets. Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d. He insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies. Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d He told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. \u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said. Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said. Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
