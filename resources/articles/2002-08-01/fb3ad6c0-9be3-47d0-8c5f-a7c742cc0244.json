Up and down the country will be heard that traditional cry of non-fans saying: \"Already? But it had only just finished!\" In recent years the popularity of the sport has mushroomed beyond all expectations; violence is down, racist chanting is rare and the quality of the matches is significantly better. But still some commentators go all misty eyed about times gone by: \"Oh it's not the same these days, I mean, when I were a lad, you'd be packed into the terraces behind a 7ft chain smoker, unable to see your team draw nil-nil after the defenders kept passing back to the keeper and then on the way home you'd get beaten up for wearing the wrong scarf by that bloke who'd been shouting racist abuse. Ah, happy days.\" But a decade on from the formation of the Premiership, the majority of clubs that were left behind are now in trouble. The collapse of ITV Digital and the subsequent resignations have left the Football League in crisis. Supporters watching games this afternoon may already notice the lower division clubs making one or two economies. Unable to afford proper kits, players will be wearing embarrassingly tight shirts and huge baggy shorts from the lost property basket. The ball will be a plastic one from Woolworth's with Harry Potter on the side, and when it's kicked out of the ground the goalie will be forced to go round and ask that grumpy old man next door: \"Excuse me, can we have our ball back please?\" Final score two-nil. \"It wasn't two-nil, that second one was a post - it went straight over my jumper.\" \"No, it would have gone in-off!\" Another worry for the Football League is that while arrests are down in the Premiership, according to tables published yesterday they actually increased in the First Division. It's no wonder ITV Digital went bankrupt; the broadcasters boasted that their interactive coverage made it just like being at a real match. So when you leapt off the sofa to celebrate your team's goal they supplied a couple of opposing fans to beat you up. You have to question the wisdom of publishing league tables for football arrests. Did they imagine the perpetrators would weep with remorse at being brandished the worst trouble makers in the land? \"I'm so dashed upset, Tarquin, we've really let down the vast majority of genuine peace-loving sports fans at our club.\" \"Yes, Julian, the shame of it! I'll never be able to show my face down at my men's anger management workshop again.\" Or is there perhaps an outside chance that the Neanderthals might take some sort of perverse pride in being top of the arrests league? Maybe the police could arrange a pitched battle between the fans that finished third and fourth to decide who gets a play-off place. They might at least have printed the tables the other way up, with the clubs with the most arrests at the bottom. It's the best chance I've got of seeing Fulham at the top of the Premiership. With Tony Blair helping to set up a new football league in Afghanistan, maybe other problems in the region could be solved with British football know-how, by sending Stoke City and Millwall supporters to Iraq. In fact, football violence roughly fits the Marxist analysis of war between capitalist economies. While working-class fans are beating each other up, the real enemy, football's ruling class, remains safe in their corporate boxes and chairmen's suites, becoming multi-millionaires as they bring poverty to the poorer clubs. Well this season it's all going to change. Suddenly aware of their own strength, the supporters of the world will unite and throw off the chains of having to pay \u00a345 for a replica shirt that cost 10p to produce in some sweatshop in China. Instead of pointlessly attacking each other, the newly politicised fans will storm the Manchester United directors' box, declaring the people's first socialist soccer soviet. The super-rich chairmen of the big clubs will be lined up and shot, but they'll survive because Andy Cole is doing the shooting. But no more will the big clubs grow ever richer off the players they have taken from the lower leagues, no more will the ordinary fan be priced out of the ground. At last it can be said: Chelsea fans are revolting! A supporter's revolution would slightly change the game of course. \"Quick pass!\" \"Sorry comrade, but such a move would have to be ratified by the people's executive committee!\" But by bringing Marxist doctrine to the Premiership we'll prove that socialism is the only way forward for the rest of our society. \"The workers! United! Will never be defeated - because frankly a score draw is always the fairest result!\" And imagine the thrilling climax to the season when you know every club will finish with exactly the same number of points and identical goal difference. Er, hang on, I think I'd better think this out again! comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
