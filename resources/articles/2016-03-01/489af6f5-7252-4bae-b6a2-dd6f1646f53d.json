With Spurs second, five points behind Leicester City, Pochettino took the view that he could not risk playing his strongest team at Dortmund and, rather predictably, his side were well beaten. Dortmund, who are second in the Bundesliga, won 3-0 against a callow Spurs side showing seven changes from the XI who lined up against Arsenal last Saturday \u2013 only the omission of the suspended Dele Alli was enforced \u2013 and the second leg at White Hart Lane is now little more than a formality. Pochettino flatly rejected the idea that his team selection meant there was extra pressure on his players to win at Villa Park, yet it was tempting to wonder whether the Spurs manager could have approached the two games the other way round, mindful that R\u00e9mi Garde\u2019s side are bottom of the league, heading for the Championship and desperately low on confidence. \u201cI think we need to show respect to Aston Villa,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think we are wrong if we don\u2019t show respect to Aston Villa. And in the same way, I explained last week, the players are not machines, I think we\u2019ve come through a very busy period and we play a lot with different circumstances. There\u2019s no regret about nothing. It\u2019s only that we need to know that the level, to compete in the Champions League in the future, you need to improve.\u201d Spurs have won only two of their past seven matches in all competitions but Pochettino sounded relaxed about their form. He laughed off a question about whether he was talking to the club about a new contract, reasoning that the timing was not right to wade into that subject on the back of a heavy defeat, yet he also made the point that \u201cbecause it was a bad night for us we cannot put in the bin all that happened before\u201d. As for the idea that expectations had been raised at White Hart Lane and that this was a crucial stage of the campaign for Spurs, Pochettino cast his mind back to last season, when his team had won only one Premier League game in seven and travelled to Villa Park, coincidentally, badly in need of a lift, to provide some perspective. \u201cCrucial was last season when we were 14th in November,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I think all is positive. I think that we have a very good run and have no doubt about the team. Sometimes you accept that you cannot perform always. But I am happy with the team and happy with the players.\u201d Spurs won 2-1 in that league game at Villa Park 16 months ago, courtesy of goals from Nacer Chadli and Harry Kane in the last six minutes, and anything other than another victory would be seen as a major disappointment and raise questions about whether their season is starting to unravel. \u201cWe need to finish strong,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf not, maybe we have a problem. But you always try to fight, I think that the whole season was good, against Borussia Dortmund it\u2019s true that it was difficult. But we need to be positive for the end of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
