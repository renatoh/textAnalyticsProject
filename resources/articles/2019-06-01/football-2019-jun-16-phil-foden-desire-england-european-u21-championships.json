It must be some kitchen. Must be some trophy cabinet, too, though it may not be around much longer should the England midfielder add the European Under\u201121 Championship to his impressive collection in the next fortnight. Foden has designs on a larger cabinet in the home he purchased for his parents, Phil and Claire, for around \u00a32m late last year. A historic domestic treble with Manchester City \u2013 making it five major honours won with his boyhood club before turning 19 last month \u2013 stands alongside the Under-17 World Cup plus a host of individual accolades in the teenager\u2019s showcase. It serves as a frequent reminder of how often the gifted talent has fulfilled expectations for club and country. And it is struggling. \u201cIt is not too bad,\u201d says Foden of a medal haul that began as an eight-year-old for Reddish Vulcans. \u201cI keep them all in a cabinet in the kitchen. It\u2019s getting full, though. I might need a new one. Sometimes I\u2019ll walk past and just have a look, and realise I\u2019ve won a lot. The World Cup was the first, the biggest one I\u2019d won, and then I started winning trophies with City, cups and leagues. It\u2019s hard to pick one out. Every single one is special to me.\u201d It was at the World Cup in 2017 that Foden announced his vast potential to a wider audience with two goals in the final over Spain and a string of impressive displays that earned him the Golden Ball. He sees parallels between the quality and balance of that squad and Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s Under\u201121s here in Italy but believes success at the Euros represents a more formidable challenge. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be even harder to win this tournament because there are stronger teams and a lot of better players,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to get going and see how it goes. There are better players who are a lot older and more experienced so it will be harder [than the Under-17s World Cup]. \u201cTo win takes a lot of heart and desire, especially when you get into the later stages and you\u2019re playing the same team, but you haven\u2019t got the legs. You\u2019ve just got to use your mind and heart and pull through it. A lot of heart and determination have to be used.\u201d Foden enters the Euros, that start for England against France in Cesena on Tuesday, with a billing as one of the potential stand-out players of the tournament. Increasing recognition and success make it virtually impossible for the lad from Stockport to experience a normal teenage life, a prospect even more remote after he became a father this year. Football and fishing are his escapes. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to lead a normal life,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, even when I go shopping I am going to get stopped for a picture. I don\u2019t mind that. People are always watching you. It\u2019s what happens. I was walking down the road after one of my first games and people were asking for a picture. From that moment I knew it was going to be hard. \u201cI go fishing with my dad when I have a bit of free time; it\u2019s relaxing. No one is going to mither you on a quiet pond. I\u2019ve always done it.\u201d His biggest catch? \u201cI think it was a catfish, 136lb,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took three of us to get it in. That\u2019s not in the trophy cabinet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
