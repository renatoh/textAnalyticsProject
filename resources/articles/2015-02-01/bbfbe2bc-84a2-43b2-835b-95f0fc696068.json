Abbott survived the motion to vacate all leadership positions on Monday by 61 votes to 39 and said he was \u201cchastened\u201d by the message. He promised that he, and his office, would be more consultative but he has resisted the mounting calls to remove Credlin or change her role. \u201cI\u2019m not about to give the prime minister advice on how he should run his office, nor do I expect him to give me advice on how I should run my office,\u201d Bishop told ABC Radio on Tuesday morning. \u201cBut we both heed the views of the party room, and if there are valid concerns then I am confident that the prime minister will take that into account.\u201d \u201cPeople have been very frank and blunt on their assessment of the prime minister\u2019s office, and the prime minister is a smart man. He will take this into account,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThe PM must respond to their concerns if they are valid concerns.\u201d Bishop, who was touted as one of Abbott\u2019s possible leadership rivals, said Credlin was an \u201cindispensable part of our team in opposition\u201d . \u201cPeta Credlin is a very powerful figure in the sense she\u2019s strong, there\u2019s a lot of opinions, she is very protective of the PM and has been an indispensable part of our team in opposition. The prime minister is very close with Peta, she offers him good advice and they work together as a team.\u201d The social services minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters that replacing Credlin \u201cwas a matter for Tony Abbott\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t give him lectures on his staff and he doesn\u2019t give me lectures on mine,\u201d Morrison said. Abbott will face the Liberal party room on Tuesday morning for the first time since he defeated a spill motion. He has described the vote of 101 MPs and senators as a \u201cnear death experience\u201d and has vowed to learn from it. \u201cThere were lessons in last year. Plainly, we did bite off more than we could chew in some important respects, and what I\u2019m determined to be is much more consultative and collegial this year,\u201d Abbott told ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Monday night. \u201cWe will socialise decisions before we finalise them and that way we\u2019re more likely to take the people with us.\u201d Backbenchers are expected to air a number of grievances around the Coalition\u2019s policy direction at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the first since the leadership issue went to a vote. Many have said they are willing to give Abbott more time, as long as their concerns and grievances are heeded. Former assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos, who backed the spill motion, said the prime minister can expect a vocal backbench. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll find a lot of MPs on their feet raising issues, and the point I\u2019ve made continually over the last week or so, I think there\u2019s a new assertiveness on the backbench,\u201d Sinodinos said. \u201cThe backbench, according to the prime minister, will be more involved in policy making, but I think you\u2019ll find the backbench will also be out there making it clear to the public and others what their policy ideas are, so it\u2019s going to be an interesting time in that sense,\u201d he said. Dennis Jensen, who also supported the spill motion, said backbenchers have fallen into line behind Abbott after the majority of the party room backed him on Monday. \u201cThis has been something that has been required for the prime minister to actually see the full depth of feeling within the party room in terms of the necessity for that change of style and substance,\u201d Jensen said. Abbott acknowledged that doctors were angry at the lack of consultation over changes to Medicare, and has said the government will not implement new changes without discussing them with the medical profession first. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence\u201d Bishop or other possible leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull have disagreed with the government\u2019s policy direction. \u201cThis is a government who don\u2019t take advice. They need to sit down with people, they don\u2019t need to be at war with the doctors and nurses. They don\u2019t need to be at war with university students and they certainly shouldn\u2019t be cutting pensions,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cThis is a government more extreme and their personal views are more extreme than the mainstream of Australian society.\u201d Abbott is also likely to be asked to clarify whether or not South Australian shipbuilders will be given the opportunity to build Australia\u2019s next fleet of submarines. On Sunday, he promised South Australian MP Sean Edwards that local submariners would be part of a \u201ccomprehensive evaluation process\u201d, a term Edwards admits he has never before heard. Labor probed the government on whether the evaluation process was the same as an open tender during Monday\u2019s Senate question time. Finance minister Mathias Cormann stepped back from using the term \u201ctender\u201d, but said that deal would be subject to the \u201cproper process\u201d and that the government was committed to getting the best product for the best price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
