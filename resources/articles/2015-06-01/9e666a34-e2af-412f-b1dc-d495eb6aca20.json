The G7 group of industrialised countries are meeting on Sunday and Monday in Germany, and a key subject of the discussions will be the forthcoming UN climate change negotiations, scheduled for a crunch conference in Paris this December, which will determine world governments\u2019 response to the climate crisis for decades to come. Poor countries want financial assistance from the rich nations \u2013 which have, historically, been the most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 to help them reduce their carbon output, invest in clean technology and adapt to the effects of climate change. At the last major climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, the developing world was promised financial flows of at least $100bn (\u00a365bn) a year by 2020, but in many cases the money has been slow in coming. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who will preside over the Paris talks, said this aid would be the key issue. \u201cThe question of financing is, in fact, decisive for reaching an agreement in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cThe promise of Copenhagen must be kept, absolutely \u2013 it is the basis of trust, and for many countries it is the condition of reaching agreement. Therefore, it is a priority as president [of the negotiations].\u201d He said that the G7 meeting would be vital in sending a strong signal to developing countries ahead of the Paris talks. \u201cWhat the richest countries of the G7 will say is very important in itself and is eagerly awaited by all who are in COP21[as the Paris climate conference is known]. \u201cThe G7 allows for real discussion. So we have to be pragmatic, but we also have to fix ambitious objectives.\u201d At the UN climate conference in Paris this December, world governments are expected to forge a new global deal on climate change, including commitments from both developed and developing countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020 when current commitments run out. But while countries are still committed to meeting the carbon targets that were set at Copenhagen in 2009, the status of pledges on financial contributions from rich to poor countries is less clear. Rich nations promised at Copenhagen that, by 2020, investments of at least $100bn a year would be channelled to the developing world, to help cut emissions and adapt to climate change. So far only about half of that target has been met. The issue is muddied by a difference in interpretation among countries over what should be counted as \u201cclimate finance\u201d under the Copenhagen agreement. Some developing countries want all of the $100bn a year to come from the public purse of developed nations. But rich governments are strongly resisting that, insisting instead that private sector finance should form the lion\u2019s share of the total. There was \u201cfrequently a lot of confusion on this subject\u201d, said Fabius. \u201cSome developing countries will present commitments [on curbing greenhouse gas emissions] that are partly conditional, ie depending on international financial support.\u201d He made it clear that he wants a deal on the two key areas of the talks \u2013 limits on emissions and financing for developing countries \u2013 well in advance of the formal start of the negotiations on the last day of November. The Copenhagen conference descended, in its final hours, into scenes of chaos and vicious recriminations among countries, which overshadowed the advances made there in climate financing and emissions goals. Fabius is anxious not to repeat that experience, preferring to have the main elements of an agreement set up beforehand. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the virtue of waiting until the final minute for announcements,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is necessary to build trust, to prepare things carefully. To have an agreement [in Paris] we need some sort of financial package.\u201d He added that more money must be directed to helping poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change \u2013 this had been, to date, the \u201cpoor relation\u201d of climate finance, he said. For this reason, he is proposing the development in poor countries of an early-warning system on potential weather-related disasters for developing countries, consisting of weather forecasting, priming the emergency services and providing back-up resources for them. These can be implemented at times of crisis, which are likely to become more frequent as climate change takes hold. Fabius also called for much more investment into the development of renewable energy in the developing world, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. He said this could enable the continent to bypass the need for fossil fuels. He said the talks in Paris would succeed if governments managed \u201ca solidarity between the industrialised countries and the countries that will suffer the most from climate damage, and that also engage in the effort to limit their emissions\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
