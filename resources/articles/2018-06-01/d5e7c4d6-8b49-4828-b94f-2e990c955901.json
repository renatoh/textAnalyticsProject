Loftus-Cheek is likely to replace the injured Dele Alli in Sunday\u2019s Group G fixture in Nizhny Novgorod \u2013 while the latter is in rehabilitation from a minor thigh strain \u2013 having impressed in a 10-minute cameo against Tunisia on Monday. His focus remains solely on the World Cup but, on the team\u2019s return from Russia, the 22-year-old will seek assurances from Chelsea that he will feature regularly. Loftus-Cheek has made six Premier League starts for the club since his senior debut in December 2014 and featured only from the bench in the 2016-17 title win, making six substitute appearances. That lack of opportunity convinced him to seek out a loan move to Crystal Palace last term. He made 21 league starts for the Selhurst Park side \u2013 despite enduring a three-month hiatus as he recovered from an ankle problem \u2013 and he broke into the England setup on the back of that fine form. Chelsea are edging ever closer to appointing Maurizio Sarri as their new head coach, with Antonio Conte expecting to leave the club after two seasons, and Loftus-Cheek will report back for training towards the end of July hoping to make an impression on the new man in charge. \u201cThat\u2019s the key for me next season regarding where I end up: I want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to play as much as I can. And even this past season I didn\u2019t play as much as I would have liked, because of the injuries and stuff, so I still feel I need a proper season of playing, wherever it is. \u201cI do understand Chelsea are a big club and there is always pressure on managers to win games and trophies. So I understand they might not be willing to take a chance on someone at a bigger club. \u201cEver since I was in the Chelsea academy, I\u2019ve had that awareness that people were saying I would be the first one to break through since John Terry. I believed I could but the opportunities didn\u2019t quite come for me. It\u2019s hard to keep training at your best but I made sure I did for when the time came, or when I did get opportunities like at Palace. We\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m confident in my ability and that I can do well, wherever it is. But I\u2019m not thinking about whether I\u2019m going to play at Chelsea right now. I\u2019m only focused on the tournament.\u201d Gareth Southgate is apparently reluctant to make too many changes against Panama from the team who impressed, particularly in the first half, in Volgograd, though Loftus-Cheek is expected to fill the void left by Alli. Loftus-Cheek\u2019s muscular energy and poise on the ball unsettled tiring opponents late on against Tunisia and he forced England\u2019s corner from which Harry Kane scored the stoppage-time winner. All five of his caps have been gained since last November, though he worked extensively with Southgate in the under-21s. \u201cI like playing on the big stage, so making my debut at Wembley against Germany, the world champions, just made me really excited,\u201d added Loftus-Cheek, who has taken on a personal fitness programme, including yoga, to ease the back problems that had also threatened to hamper his development. \u201cI knew Gareth from the under-21s but senior football is a step up. You have to prove yourself at the highest club level to have a chance of getting called up. I have done that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
