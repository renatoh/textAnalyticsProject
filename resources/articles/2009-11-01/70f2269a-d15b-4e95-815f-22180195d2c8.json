RAF helicopters, mountain rescue teams and fire crews were called to rescue those trapped by rising waters in the main street and town square. Lifeboats were launched as the town bore the brunt of the heavy rain and strong winds which swept across northern England and southern Scotland. Forecasters are warning more bad weather is on the way. More than 1,000 homes in the area were without electricity, with a further 349 homes affected in nearby Keswick. Fire crews responded to emergency calls throughout west Cumbria. A police spokesman said: \"The RAF is supporting the rescue and recovery operation with three helicopters and two RAF mountain rescue teams.\" Trees were floating down the main shopping street in Cockermouth. John Carlin, owner of the Allerdale Court hotel, in Cockermouth town centre, said the amount of rainfall to hit the area was \"staggering\". \"I have lived here for 15 years and have never seen anything like it,\" he said. \"At two o'clock it was raining heavily but there was nothing here but now there is four feet of water outside my front door. The amount of rain has been staggering. \"It's desperate. The town centre is completely flooded, the only people out there at the moment are the emergency services. The water is up to the waists of the firefighters.\" RNLI lifeboat teams were set to assist the rescue operation throughout the night using up to nine lifeboats. \"The dark and cold conditions won't help, but our teams train year-round to ensure we can respond to the specific conditions faced with swift water flooding, which are different to the conditions our volunteers usually face at sea,\" said RNLI divisional inspector north Andy Clift, who was overseeing the RNLI teams from a police command centre in Penrith. \"We expect to operate throughout the night, and will assist the emergency response for as long as we are needed.\" The Met Office said the village of Seathwaite in Cumbria recorded 173mm (6.8in) of rain in 24 hours. Flooding was also reported in north-west Wales and in Dumfries and Galloway. The rain was accompanied by severe gales, with gusts of 65mph to 75mph in western coastal areas and up to 95mph over the mountains. The Environment Agency said hundreds of homes in Cockermouth, Kendal and Keswick, were flooded as the rivers Cocker, Greta and Derwent overflowed and levels rose 300mm in less than an hour. \"The ground is already saturated and the rivers are really high and moving very fast, and with more rain we will likely see more flooding,\" said a spokesman. Keswick's mayor, Andrew Lysser, said: \"It is all hands to the pump, really. The fear is if it stretches out. \"It is raining now and we have got another 10 hours of rain forecast. The water will still run of the fells and into the valleys\". The village of Shap was deluged by 38mm of rain in 12 hours. Twenty-one schools were closed for the day. Forecasters warned of further bad weather to come in northern England, north-west Wales and western Scotland with winds in parts of western England and Wales gusting at up to 70mph. The agency had 31 flood warnings and 62 less serious flood watches in place for England and Wales with Cumbria likely to continue to be badly affected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
