Hughes underwent surgery at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield last year to remove a brain tumour. A Liverpool spokesman confirmed that he is now being treated for brain cancer. \"The tumour is in his brain and he has had chemotherapy, which is working well,\" said his former team-mate Brian Hall. \"Emlyn is in good spirits; he was a battler on the pitch and now he is facing a battle of a different kind. \"He is giving this everything he has got and has a strong family behind him. \"He is a very popular character and was a great player for Liverpool and everybody at the club wishes him well.\" David Taylor, Hughes's agent, said: \"It is general knowledge that he had a brain tumour and was having radiotherapy for it. \"But he was out doing after-dinner gigs only weeks after he'd come out of hospital. That's the type of character he is. \"He is one of those people who doesn't want a fuss and just wants to get on with it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
