It will see highly respected institutions, such as Moorfields eye hospital in London and Manchester\u2019s Christie cancer centre, providing specialist services to patients potentially many miles away in another part of England. Moorfields already runs services in 22 other locations and was partly the model for the new plans. But the move has prompted fears that it will lead to the running down, and even closure, of small local hospitals which are highly valued by patients as a result of mergers and takeovers. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, will announce the dramatic step in a speech to the CBI on Friday in which he will hail it as part of the \u201cradical reform\u201d the health service must undergo if it is to remain viable. He has pledged to transform the way the NHS in England works by 2020 so it can withstand the huge pressures caused by the growing and ageing population, growth in the number of people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and dementia, and tight budgets expected for years to come. He will announce the formation of 13 \u201cnew hospital vanguards\u201d, nine of them chains, which will work together to an unprecedented degree. For example, specialist orthopaedic hospitals in London, Birmingham and Oswestry are forming the National Orthopaedic Alliance. They \u201caim to create a UK-wide franchise or chain of orthpaedic providers to deliver outstanding and consistent care in more areas\u201d. Three centres of outstanding care \u2013 Manchester\u2019s Christie hospital, and the Royal Marsden and University College hospital, both in London \u2013 are also banding together to extend their work across England. Likewise, Northumbria healthcare NHS foundation trust sees its new Northumbria foundation group as a way of \u201cacquiring and/or merging [with] other hospital trusts\u201d. It has already taken over North Cumbria University hospitals NHS trust. The plan will benefit patients, according to Stevens, because it will see some of the NHS\u2019s best hospitals delivering services inside others, with highly skilled doctors working at several places across a week. Moorfields already runs services in 22 different locations in and around London, including a clinic at the Dartford and Gravesham trust in Kent. The Royal Marsden cancer hospital uses its expertise to provide cancer services at Kingston and Queen Mary\u2019s hospitals in greater London. Stevens will say that it is time for hospitals that are separate or even rival organisations to start working closely together because they are better at providing many types of care than some existing hospitals, many of which are struggling. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the world\u2019s best hospitals and specialists in this country, and it\u2019s right they should be able to extend their reach more widely, as the vanguard programme will now allow them to do,\u201d he will tell the CBI conference. \u201cThe era of go-it-alone individual hospitals is now being superseded by more integrated care partnerships, both within local areas and across different parts of the country. Our new approach to hospital partnerships will help sustain the viability of local hospitals, share clinical and management expertise across geographies, and drive efficiencies beyond the walls of individual institutions.\u201d The decision to permit hospitals to band together into chains, which are common in many other countries, overturns 67 years of NHS history. Ed Smith, the chair of NHS financial regulator Monitor, said the era of standalone hospitals such as the foundation trust hospitals introduced by the last Labour government, was dead. Smith said: \u201cThese were right at the time, but the economic and clinical circumstances facing the NHS are now different, and our response needs to evolve.\u201d Stevens\u2019s move, which the government welcomed, sweeps away several decades of NHS policy by replacing competition between separate hospital trusts \u2013 which was pushed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\u2019s administrations and extended further still by the coalition through Andrew Lansley\u2019s unpopular Health and Social Care Act 2012 \u2013 with what he hopes will become widespread collaboration. While hospitals would still retain their separate identities for the time being, NHS sources admitted it could lead to big or high-performing hospitals taking over smaller district general hospitals, many of which are increasingly in the red and struggling to provide high-class care, especially with a growing shortage of many types of health professionals. However, Labour warned that the move could result in smaller local hospitals ultimately reducing the services they offered. \u201cPeople will be suspicious at talk of \u2018hospital chains\u2019 given this government\u2019s track record on the NHS. These plans for collaboration must not become an excuse to make cuts or close services,\u201d said Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary. Dr Clive Peedell, an oncologist who co-chairs the National Health Action party, said: \u201cThe history of mergers in the NHS, and in the wider world of industry, is by no means one of predictable success. The danger would be that smaller trusts are gobbled up by larger ones in the name of efficiency, leaving services much less accessible for local people. And the evidence from America shows that chains end up squeezing out competition and care is compromised in the quest to maximise profit.\u201d A spokesman for the Department of Health said: \u201cThis is an important initiative to link the best performing hospitals with networks of others to help raise standards and demonstrates the NHS is finding new and innovative solutions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
