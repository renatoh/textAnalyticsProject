The club have agreed to make a down-payment, with money to follow depending on games and success. Fenerbahce are still keen to take Rebrov but the signs are that Spurs will accept Fulham's proposal rather than the Turkish club's offer to pay to borrow him until the end of next season. The Ukrainian striker is expected to have a medical at Fulham today. He has not played in the Premiership this season but the idea of staying in London appeals to him. Everton's striker Duncan Ferguson is being investigated by police over allegations that he assaulted a man who was burgling his home. The Scottish forward discovered a 37-year-old in his house on January 8 and held him until police arrived. Carl Bishop, of Walton in Liverpool, a heroin addict who admitted intent to steal when he appeared before magistrates, has been recalled to Walton prison to complete a sentence for another offence and will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court next month. Ferguson is likely to be interviewed under caution and with a solicitor present. In 2001 the Scot apprehended a man who had broken into his former home and who, along with an accomplice, was jailed for 15 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
