Charles Edwards said he expected Michael Brown to invest the money, some of which the defendant allegedly used to help swell the party's 2005 election campaign coffers by \u00a32.3m But the businessman, who made \u00a3100m selling his shares in the club, said everything looked above board at first. He told London's Southwark crown court that he was reassured that he had made a wise investment by convincing looking documents suggesting his money was earning handsome profits. But the prosecution claims that, in reality, his misplaced trust and cash helped finance a \"life of luxury\" for Glasgow-born Brown. By the time the defendant was arrested, he boasted a \u00a32.5m private jet, a Range Rover with a personalised number plate, and an apartment and office in exclusive Mayfair. Brown, 42, of Templewood Avenue, Hampstead, who is being tried in his absence, denies nine offences. They variously allege thefts totalling $11.3m (\u00a37m) from Edwards, deception, transferring criminal property, furnishing false investment information and perverting the course of justice. All are said to have been committed between February 9 2005 and April 17 2006. The crown claims Brown's \"extravagance\" and his multi-million pound donations to the Liberal Democrats were designed to create the illusion of a \"highly successful businessman\". But when his \"lies\" began to \"unravel\", the defendant allegedly used a sheaf of false documents in a bid to defuse suspicions. During a confrontation with a suspicious HSBC official, he insisted his dealings were above board and even insisted he met Prince Andrew at Buckingham Palace and had connections with the US embassy. He was arrested the following day and admitted during his interview that he left school without a maths O-level but successfully traded bonds on \"gut instinct\". Martin Edmunds QC, prosecuting, alleged the defendant finally sought to put \"entirely inappropriate and criminal pressure\" on Edwards and other multimillion pound investors who had trusted him with their money \"not to pursue complaints to police\". The barrister claimed emails sent to an investors' representative warned if they did complain \"the drawbridge to any compensation would be well and truly shut forever\". Edmunds told jurors a police search of Brown's office yielded bogus banking documents from Switzerland, Spain and Germany. \"Of course it was not real. It was simply another effort by Brown to hold off when his fraud would be found out,\" claimed counsel. Edwards told the court he succeeded his father as chairman of Manchester United in 1980. In the years that followed, he put the club on a more commercial footing by building up advertising and sponsorship and helped to set up the Premier League. He explained he was eventually appointed chief executive, a position he held until 2000, although he continued as chairman for a further three years. His departure from the club and the sale of his interests left him a multimillionaire with a need to invest his massive fortune. As he researched the best opportunities, he got to know investment company chief Boris Lopotan, who, in turn, introduced him to Brown in early 2005. During their meeting in the defendant's Mayfair apartment, he and his accountant listened as he explained his business. \"He talked about his history, the type of clients he had and the type of investment he was dealing in. He said he was dealing in bonds but was a fairly conservative trader. He was quite happy to make just one trade a month and said he only dealt in triple A rated bonds which had practically no risk at all. \"I think I came away with the impression of 36 to 50% profits a year, which was quite high. \"He also said he was a lord and referred to certain political connections as well.\" Edwards said an \"irrevocable banking instrument\" suggested any investment he made would be placed in an HSBC account and kept there in complete safely while being used to fund bond trading. It provided the insurance he wanted and he signed an agreement to invest an initial $10m (\u00a36m). He told jurors it was decided profits would be paid into the bank to increase profits. Convinced he had made the right decision, he handed over a further $2.7m (\u00a31.6m). \"Mr Brown would ring me now and again to announce a successful trade and tell me the profits made,\" he said. Eventually he received a document stating he had a total of $14.8m (\u00a39m) in his account, a \"very healthy bottom line\". But that all changed when Lopotan contacted him to say he was worried some of the trades Brown had made had not filtered through into the account. \"He said there was some money missing from it but he was hopeful he could sort it out and get it back. I still thought though the original investment was safe because of the irrevocable letter,\" he said. But as the weeks passed, it became apparent all the money he had handed over was at risk. Edwards told the court he was \"advised all the way along that if I involved the police there was no hope of any negotiation with Mr Brown\". After the police did get involved, Edwards was arrested before police realised he was actually the victim. \"I explained to them how I became involved and told them what happened,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
