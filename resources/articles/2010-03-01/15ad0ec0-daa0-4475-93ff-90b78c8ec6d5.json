Don't read ahead if you haven't seen season two, episode two. Rebecca Nicholson's episode one blog 'Keep This Party Going' Alan Ball certainly knows how to kick off an episode \u2013 we begin tonight with the severed arm of a recently departed redneck flying across the basement of doom. How did that escape plan work out for you, pal? It should be noted that burping blood isn't Eric's best look, but Pam is on hand to chop those locks and fashion him into a surprisingly accurate ringer for Glee's Sue Sylvester. No more tracksuits after this week, please. While Lafayette's imprisonment is a particularly dark diversion \u2013 and his attempts to talk his way out of it a desperate loss of strength and power for him \u2013 I did laugh when Ginger shot him then screamed \"I don't even like guns!\" However, it's not nice to get everyone excited about his reprieve last week then let the vampires feast on his bleeding body the next \u2013 even if an undead Lafayette could turn out to be a super-sized version of an already great character. Jason's Light Of Day Leadership Conference is going swimmingly, mainly as he gets to sing songs like \"If you have any doubts then sing this verse / They live forever but we were here first!\" and play some game involving flags and pulling ribbons from each other's waists. His attempts to out-testosterone fellow camper Luke to show there's life in the old dog yet, but those Eddie flashbacks also suggest that he's not quite convinced by the anti-vamp agenda. Phew. Maryann exercises her power over Sam by ordering up most of the Merlotte's menu, which does look tasty (since the last series blog, by the way, I've tasted authentic southern grits, and am now a convert). Michelle Forbes has perfected a sinister, snake-like swagger, and though there's not much of a clue about what she is or where she's from, she's able to turn Sam into doggy Sam and Merlotte's into a fun-time hangout, so it's obvious that she has considerable power. Meanwhile, Bill and Sookie are allowed to bask in the glow of make-up sex (and I'll admit that when Bill said \"Prepare to be made up to\" I felt a little queasy) for a while, but Sookie messes it all up by being nice to Jessica and taking her to see her family from a distance. Which was never going to end well, since vampires are very fast, and even super Sookie isn't much of a match for new-born vamp speed. Jessica's family turn out to be \"dumb\" and \"mean\", so she decides to chomp on her father's neck by way of revenge. Enter Bill to ruin everyone's fun / sort things out with a menacing snarl ... Cut to credits. NSFW-ometer Maryann brought a bit of sex to Merlotte's, but the real shock factor was saved for Eric's gory side. I thought the stakings of Longshadow and poor Eddie last season were as gruesome as it could get, but watching Lafayette gnaw at a severed leg in order to fashion a tool out of a hip replacement was truly wretch-worthy. Body count Zero! But it's not looking great for Jessica's family. Line of the week \"I'm a survivor first, a capitalist second and a whole bunch of other shit after that, but a hooker dead last. So if I got even a Jew at an al-Qaida pep rally shot at getting my black ass up out of this motherfucker, I'm taking it\" \u2013 Lafayette tries to charm his way out of captivity. Notes Did the shop assistant assume Bill and Eric were a vampire couple? A thousand fan-fics are born. Prize berk Luke is providing some seriously funny lines, not least by describing himself as \"the Lukeinator\" and Jason as \"some Muslim Buffy with a dick\". Love that Sookie isn't taken in by Maryann's talk. Did anyone with an ear for languages pick out what it is that she was thinking? It certainly wasn't the native tongue of Cape Cod. Finally, a special announcement \u2013 if anybody has any information regarding the whereabouts of Eggs's shirt, please call 0800-WE-GET-IT-HE'S-RIPPED.
