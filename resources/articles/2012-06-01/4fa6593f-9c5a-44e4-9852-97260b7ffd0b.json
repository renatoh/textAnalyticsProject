Last week, 60% of shareholders in advertising giant WPP voted against chief executive Martin Sorrell's \u00a36.8m payout. The week before that, outrage greeted a report that FTSE 100 bosses took an average 12% pay rise last year; even while the average employee got a below-inflation raise of 1%. Britain may be in a double-dip recession, which has depressed share prices as well as wages, but we are obviously not all in the doldrums together. And if there was ever a coalition minister to tackle top pay, it's Vince Cable. Of all the cabinet, the business secretary has tried hardest to articulate the public's anger at the widening gulf between the rich and the rest of society. At his first party-conference speech on becoming business secretary, he blasted banking's \"spivs and gamblers\". This spring, he had a crack at his Conservative coalition partners: \"The old-fashioned, backward-looking, negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is to \u2026 stroke fat cats until they purr with pleasure.\" Fantastic talk; not entirely borne out by Mr Cable's practice. Take his proposals on executive pay. There is much here to applaud; but these reforms do not live up to the Liberal Democrat's image as a fearless campaigner against entrenched economic interests. Indeed, they do not live up to Mr Cable's own proposals in this area unveiled just a few months ago. What was supposedly a consultation evidently turned into a watering-down exercise. The government's proposal to give shareholders the power simply to block excessive annual payouts to executives has turned instead into a vote, possibly once every three years, on pay policy. This might appear a small or semantic difference. But the latest version of this proposal carries the risk that shareholders will only get to have a say on vague commitments and virtuous phrases, rather than cold, hard and large numbers. The big-business lobby, the CBI, greeted this dilution as \"rightly focus[ing] on board pay strategy, not individual pay packages\". What delights the bosses of big business is precisely what should annoy the rest of us: the focus should be the other way around. Similarly, the business secretary was going to give shareholders a binding vote on the total remuneration for bosses \u2013 a big break from the current system where basic salary is categorised separately from bonuses, long-term incentives and pension payouts. That has now been toned down to a mere advisory vote, which the executives can choose to ignore. Finally, an approach centred on giving shareholders more power is over-reliant on well-paid fund managers scrapping with fellow members of the same cosy club. Those caveats expressed, Mr Cable should be congratulated for making history. He was already the first business secretary to dare suggest that workers might sit on the company remuneration committees that set bosses' pay (a suggestion that was cast overboard months ago); but he remains the first to push for shareholders to block these handouts. Mr Cable deserves if not three, at least one-and-a-half cheers. Labour yesterday made sharp criticisms of Mr Cable's plans; but it should remember that for 13 years it did little to battle corporate greed, and a lot to facilitate it. Yet Mr Cable and his Lib Dem colleagues have scope and reason to go much further. As shown in our special reports this week, the long slump is pushing many Britons below the breadline. Poverty is not the same as inequality, but the latter makes the former harder for the rest of us to stomach. And when David Cameron blasts legal tax-avoidance schemes as \"morally wrong\", he's channelling a wider public dissatisfaction at how top earners often ignore their social obligations. This is territory that the Lib Dems need to campaign on if they want to mark themselves out from their Conservative partners. For Mr Cable, Nick Clegg and their team it's hard to see the downside of this approach \u2013 and easy to appreciate the political advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
