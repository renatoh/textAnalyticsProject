He expressed some sympathy for his old Leicester team-mate Dean Richards, suggesting that his former colleague had simply buckled under \"big pressure\" to win a big game. Johnson, describing the affair as \"a sorry episode\" and \"sad for the game\", said he had never seen a blood capsule during his time as England's captain and manager. \"I don't think it is widespread. It is certainly not widespread in my experience as a player and with the England team this year managing it. Have things like that happened before? I think you would be naive to say they haven't. Is it widespread? No, I don't think it is,\" said Johnson, speaking on Radio 5 Live. \"Dean's taken a desperate gamble and it's clearly wrong. He's been caught out, he's paid a heavy price and the game's been dragged through the mud. I'm particularly sad because Dean is probably the biggest name in Leicester Tigers' history. \"For a club like Quins it's taken away all the good things they've done on and off the field. The guys involved have lost their jobs and have had a pretty heavy punishment for it. Ultimately there may be a bit of tidying up of the blood substitution rule. I think it is a little bit open to abuse and it would be a good thing in being tidied up.\" Referring to the drugs issues at Bath last season, he called for players to be more self-disciplined: \"Players have got to understand that with the privileges of professional rugby comes responsibility.\" The former England captain Martin Corry, however, has questioned whether the Rugby Football Union's offer to give players immunity from disciplinary action if they blow the whistle on cheating by other players is practicable. \"Saying 'Come out and dob your mates in' implies this culture of cheating is rife throughout the game,\" Corry said. \"It is not and it is so far from the mark. What we have to do now is build the game and show what has happened this summer is an anomaly and the only way of doing that is to go unblemished for the years to come.\" More muck is set to be raked today after European Rugby Cup Ltd confirmed it would be publicly releasing the full transcripts of the appeal hearings last month which saw Quins fined \u00a3260,000. Sources say the contents are less explosive than the testimony given by the Quins wing Tom Williams, who alleged that club officials put pressure on him to lie to the appeal tribunal. There is believed to be more detail, however, relating to Williams's statement that, at one stage, he asked the club to pay off the mortgage on the house owned by himself and his girlfriend. It also remains to be seen whether the four previous instances of Quins indulging in blood-related skulduggery will be revealed. There continues to be legal disquiet, meanwhile, about the manner in which the case details have been publicised. Friends of Richards, the former England No8, believe that the early release of Williams' testimony ran contrary to accepted practice and that all the evidence statements should have been released simultaneously. Richards' advisers were unhappy he was permitted only one full working day in which to construct a verbal counter-argument to Williams' prepared statement. He has yet to make a final decision on whether to challenge his three-year ban from the sport through the European court of justice. ERC will debate whether to ban Quins from this season's Heineken Cup at a board meeting in Dublin today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
