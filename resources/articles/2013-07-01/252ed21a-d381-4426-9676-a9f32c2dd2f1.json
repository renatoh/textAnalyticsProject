Owner Ryan Lowder's bone marrow makes even the most timid eater want to lick their fingers while his ricotta dumplings have food critics writing rave reviews.

Waiters come quickly to your table and take your order on small handheld devices which send your requests straight to the chefs in their open-air kitchen. The pizzas are anything but traditional. Try the patate with yukon gold potatoes, fontina and goat cheese, rosemary, wild arugula and truffle oil variety, or the Tutta Bella pizza with caramelised onion and peppers and homemade sausage.
