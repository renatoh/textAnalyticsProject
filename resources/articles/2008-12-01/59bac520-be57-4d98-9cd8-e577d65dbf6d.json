Speaking during a visit to Helmand province to highlight the deployment of hundreds of fresh troops to the region, the prime minister said the use of such a young boy in the bombing would \"offend public opinion across the world\". One marine serving with 45 Commando was killed and two injured by a roadside bomb near Sangin yesterday. Later, a patrol was approached by the child pushing a wheelbarrow full of newspapers concealing a bomb which killed two more members of 45 Commando and a soldier serving with Commando Logistics Regiment. As he visited a watchtower 35 miles from where the soldiers were ambushed, Brown described it as \"a cowardly attack\". The deaths bring the total number of British military personnel who have lost their lives in Afghanistan since the start of the operations in 2001 to 132. Three of the dead men were based in Arbroath, Scotland. Paying tribute to them, Major Spike Kelly, of 45 Commando, said they were \"highly professional and thoroughly committed commandos\". \"They were an enormous credit to their unit, to the Royal Marines and to the armed forces as a whole,\" he said. Brown is expected to confirm in the Commons on Monday that Britain's 8,100-strong force in Afghanistan is being bolstered by two companies \u2013 comprising about 200 troops \u2013 from 2 Prince of Wales Royal Regiment, which is serving as the theatre reserve battalion in Cyprus. Commanders in Afghanistan called in the extra troops in October for operations to improve security in central Helmand and it is expected they will remain for a couple of months. Defence sources said they did not represent a permanent increase in the UK deployment or part of a new surge in international forces in Afghanistan. Later at a joint press conference with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, Brown said Britain had offered to provide a taskforce to help tackle corruption in the country. Britain would also give $10m (\u00a36.7m) to help the registration process for elections due in Afghanistan next year. Brown said he had seen \"real progress\" in education and health services during a flying visit to Musa Qala, a town which was lost to the Taliban earlier this year but later recovered by allied forces. The revelation of the increase in troop numbers comes as Brown leads a review of the UK's strategy in the country, which could result in more being sent next year. Pressure will mount next month when Barack Obama becomes US president. He has made the conflict a top priority and said he would send extra US forces to help \"destroy\" al-Qaida. There have been growing hints that the UK could increase its contribution, not least from the head of the armed forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup. He warned, however, that the military could not cope with simply switching the 4,000 forces due to be pulled out of Iraq in the first half of next year to Afghanistan. Eleven British soldiers have been killed in southern Afghanistan since the beginning of last month, nine of whom were marines. Three soldiers were killed in one week in November. Forty British troops have been killed in southern Afghanistan this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
