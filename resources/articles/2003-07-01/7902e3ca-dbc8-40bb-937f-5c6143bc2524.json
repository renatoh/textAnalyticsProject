The database, called Childbase, already includes 220,000 images distributed by paedophiles on the internet of children being abused. It utilises the most powerful image recognition computer programme in the world, mapping the facial characteristics of each victim, and enabling cross-checks against millions of images within seconds. It will tell investigators instantly if there is a new victim, or if a particular case has already been dealt with, shortening the laborious and harrowing task of going through books of child abuse images. The National Crime Squad, which developed the \u00a3500,000 database, said that Childbase was the most powerful tool the police had ever had in the fight against internet paedophilia. It will be available to every police force in the UK and may eventually be used by overseas law enforcement agencies investigating child abuse images online. John Carr, a member of the government's internet taskforce on child protection, said the database would transform international investigations into child sex abuse. He said: \"If a policeman in Alberta, Canada, or Barnsley, or Bangladesh seizes a computer with paedophile images on it, he will be able to find out which child it is being abused, whether the child has been identified before, whether this case has already been investigated or if it is a new victim. \"It is going to have a major effect in saving police time and resources through duplicating investigations and it will free up police time to get on with the main business of catching paedophiles. \"It will also, for the first time ever, give us an idea of the volume of new material coming on to the internet because there has not yet been a central database so we don't know whether an image is new or whether it identifies a new victim. \"This is a world first and another big warning to paedophiles that you are not safe anywhere.\" Childbase was put together using images gathered during the 1998 international investigation into the infamous paedophile ring known as the Wonderland Club which led to 1,263 victims and 108 suspects being identified in 14 countries. Most of the images come from the British arm of the investigation, Operation Cathedral. The database follows a decision in May by members of the G8 industrialised nations, including Britain, to set up an international database of child abuse images. Each country is producing its own database but Britain's is the first, and is likely to provide the model. At present, many of the photographs of victims are available only on national databases or in police files, making it difficult to cross-reference the children involved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
