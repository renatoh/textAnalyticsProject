Reacted sharply to save from Vladimir Weiss shortly after that scare. Nathaniel Clyne 8 Burst forward throughout, creating chances and offering width to remind Roy Hodgson that Kyle Walker does not have the monopoly on attacking thrust from right-back. Gary Cahill 7 Set alarm bells ringing when he required treatment but a commanding clearance immediately dispelled the doubts. Strong at the back and threatening at set-pieces. Chris Smalling 5 Horrible error should have put England behind in a match they dominated. His speed is undoubtedly an asset but lack of concentration remains an issue that could be costly. Ryan Bertrand 6 Fortunate to escape at least a yellow card for an elbow on Peter Pekarik and was booked. A couple of shaky moments but recovered well to show he is an able deputy for Danny Rose. Eric Dier 7 Patrolled midfield with composure and class, two exquisite passes to Daniel Sturridge evoking memories of David Beckham. Has become undroppable, even when others are rested. Jordan Henderson 7 Had two shots blocked after arriving late in the box and his passing was crisp and probing. Blew away doubts about his fitness and offers Hodgson the option of extra running power. Jack Wilshere 6 Started well, releasing Jamie Vardy with an intuitive early ball, but became casual in possession and was brought off not long after half-time. A missed chance to put pressure on the first XI. Adam Lallana 7 Always on the move, his ability to play sharp triangles was a constant menace. Fired one effort wide and another at Matus Kozakic but still has not scored for England and that must change. Daniel Sturridge 6 Had an early point-blank attempt blocked and took time to get involved after that. Failed to connect on the volley inside the six-yard box and Harry Kane may return to the side. Jamie Vardy 7 Clever first-time effort set the tone and laid on chances for Sturridge and Lallana before destroying Martin Skrtel for pace only to see his shot saved. His threat waned as Slovakia wised up. Substitutes Rooney 6 (for Wilshere, 56) added creativity if not goals; Alli 7 (for Lallana, 60) had an effort cleared off the line; Kane 6 (for Sturridge, 76) little time to impress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
