Judge Susan Bolton granted a preliminary injunction which prevents implementation of two main elements of the legislation: the requirement that police determine the immigration status of people they arrest or question should they suspect them of being illegal, and the part of the new law that would make it a state crime for a foreigner to be in Arizona without registration papers. The injunction will hold, Bolton said, until the courts have considered a lawsuit against Arizona by the federal government that seeks permanently to block the new law on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. The temporary and partial reprieve marks success, in the short term at least, of attempts by the Obama administration to maintain federal control of immigration policy, against efforts by states, led by Arizona, to take the matter into their own hands. Several states have expressed support for Arizona's legislation that was due to come into effect today. But the legal ruling risks a potential white backlash as opinion polls have shown consistently high support for the law across the United States. In the latest, by CNN and Opinion Research, 55% of those sampled said they were in favour of the SB 1070 law, although in response to a separate question 54% said they thought it would lead to greater discrimination against Hispanics. Mark Krikorian, director of the Centre for Immigration Studies, a thinktank that supports tighter immigration controls, said a hardening of positions was likely in the wake of the ruling. \"This will add fuel to the frustrations of states over the lack of federal government action in enforcing the immigration laws.\" Police in Phoenix have added extra security around the central courthouse in expectation of large demonstrations, including crowds that supported the new law and are likely to be incensed by the partial block on it. Despite Bolton's ruling, thousands of Hispanic, trade unionists and religious activists are also expected to descend on Arizona to protest against the legislation. More than 500 campaigners from California will be leading the charge, together with busloads of protesters from other states. Other demonstrations and pilgrimages to Arizona were being planned from New York, Chicago and Atlanta. Under the terms of the original Senate bill (SB) 1070, Arizona police were obliged to investigate the immigration status of anyone they encounter \u2013 whether for a traffic violation, a neighbour dispute or any other minor matter \u2013 whom they suspected of not having proper documents. The law threatened to wrestle immigration policy out of the hands of the federal government and fragment it across the US, with many other states already expressing interest in copying Arizona's example. Paco Fabian, an immigration policy expert, stressed the temporary nature of the injunction. \"Let's not forget that at any moment it could be lifted and the law will be back. That's why groups will continue to oppose it.\" While some of the most draconian aspects of the law have been blocked, Hispanic groups are unhappy about sections including a provision to make it a crime for undocumented day labourers to get into an employer's vehicle and a vaguely-worded clause against the \"transportation\" and \"harbouring\" of illegal immigrants. At the centre of the dispute stands Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa county, which covers Phoenix, the state capital. He has pioneered many policies now extended statewide under SB 1070, including regular raids by state troopers on factories and housing developments in which undocumented Hispanic immigrants are rounded up to be deported. Arpaio promised to go ahead with a planned raid, his 17th in three years, involving 200 officers and volunteers. Arpaio has said he has all the powers he needs under existing laws and has vowed to expand his notorious \"tent city\" \u2013 an adhoc prison under canvas \u2013to make way for more detained illegal immigrants. He also threatened to come down hard on any protesters who got in the way of his tough policies, responding to rumours that Phoenix jail would be picketed today by activists by telling ABC News: \"If anyone wants to block my jails they can have a little trip into the jails. We are not going to put up with any civil disobedience.\" Police chiefs around Arizona expressed relief following the ruling, fearing accusation of racial profiling of Hispanics. \"I am pleased that the aspects which we put forward as problematic for enforcement are precisely the aspects that Judge Bolton ruled on today,\" Tucson police chief Roberto Villase\u00f1or told the Washington Post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
