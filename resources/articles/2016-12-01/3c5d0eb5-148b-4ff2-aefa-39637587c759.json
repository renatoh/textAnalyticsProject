The former world champion and Mercedes\u2019 head of motorsport seemed to be at odds at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as Hamilton defied team orders in his attempt to snatch the Formula One drivers\u2019 title off team-mate Nico Rosberg. However, following Rosberg\u2019s retirement, Mercedes have been forced into focusing on ironing out any issues with Hamilton as they continue their search for the world champion\u2019s replacement. Valtteri Bottas is Mercedes\u2019 No1 choice to replace the German but Williams have rejected an opening offer to release the Finn from his 2017 contract. In two short videos posted by Hamilton on Instagram on Sunday night, the 31-year-old revealed he had held a meeting in Wolff\u2019s kitchen, where the pair are seen sitting alongside each other. \u201cWe just had an amazing meeting,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI just wanted to send on a message to let you know that we are going to be the strongest partnership next year and we look forward to fighting for this championship again.\u201d Wolff, who said on Friday that in hindsight Mercedes should have let the two drivers race \u201cin the way they deemed to be appropriate\u201d in Abu Dhabi, also wants to put the controversy behind them. \u201cWe spent a good couple of hours together,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cWe had a really fantastic meeting and we will be coming back so strong in 2017.\u201d Mercedes could, however, be without their technical director, Paddy Lowe, for next season after the 54-year-old was linked with a return to Williams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
