Instead, the 43rd edition of the parade on Oxford Street, which has been celebrated annually along the strip since 1978, will move to the nearby Sydney Cricket Ground, in a scaled-back, Covid-safe event. To be held on Saturday 6 March, capacity for the event will be limited to 23,000 tickets \u2013 about half of the ground\u2019s capacity \u2013 with organisers charging $20 for admission. Albert Kruger, Mardi Gras chief executive, said the event will \u201cmove away from large floats, centring instead on the outlandish pageantry of costumes, puppetry and props that make it such a phenomenon to witness\u201d. \u201cIt was important to Mardi Gras that we rise to the occasion and to give the community the creative platform to express their pride to the world. The 2021 parade may look different to how it has been in the past, but we feel very lucky to be able to give this opportunity to our communities during these times.\u201d \u201cNot only is the SCG close to our spiritual home of Oxford Street, but it also provides the safest venue for us to hold the event and meet requirements of physical distancing and contact tracing,\u201d Kruger said. The Mardi Gras parade in 2021, with a theme of \u201crise\u201d, will also be broadcast live on television. Kruger said the parade will be the centrepiece of year-round events and initiatives in 2021 to better engage the LGBTQ+ community as it adjusts to pandemic-related restrictions. Clover Moore, Sydney lord mayor, said it was \u201cpoignant that this year\u2019s parade was the last major event held before we had to go into lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus\u201d. \u201cI know many in our community, myself included, have held onto our happy memories of Mardi Gras 2020 to get us through this challenging year. \u201cMardi Gras will look different in 2021, but importantly it will give us the opportunity to come together safely and celebrate. Of course, I look forward to the day when tens of thousands of Sydneysiders and visitors from around Australia and the world can gather on Oxford Street once more.\u201d The Covid-safe edition of Sydney\u2019s Mardi gras will be the first in recent years to not welcome international tourists, with Australia\u2019s border having remained closed since it was shut at the outbreak of the pandemic in March. The Mardi Gras is the latest of Sydney\u2019s world-famous events to be significantly scaled-back out of Covid-19 precaution. In September, authorities outlined how a cut-back, shorter version of Sydney\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks will go ahead this year, with local leaders pushing ahead with events as a symbol of hope to be \u201cbeamed around the world\u201d. Tickets for the 2021 Mardi Gras event go on sale on Monday 9 November here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
