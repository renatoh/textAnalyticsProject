When the 1991 World Cup-winning prop took over from Robbie Deans as Australia's head coach in July, a few days after the Lions had won their first series for 16 years, the image of the Wallabies was one of a squad which was more individual than collective, plagued by indiscipline. Deans's reign, which started in 2008 when an unimpressed McKenzie headed off for Stade Fran\u00e7ais, was marked by headline-making off-field incidents which continued to the end when James O'Connor and Kurtley Beale were photographed in a burger bar at 4am in the week of the second Test against the Lions and the following week missed the bus for training. As the Wallabies arrived in London last month to start preparing for the opening match of their tour at Twickenham, O'Connor was getting ready to fly to England to restart his career with London Irish after a drunken night out led to his being thrown out of the squad. \"Robbie brought a number of youthful players through, like O'Connor, but he over-indulged them,\" says the former Australia coach John Connolly who, like McKenzie, used to be in charge of Queensland. \"Senior players felt alienated as some of the younger ones ran amok. I think O'Connor's problems stem from how he has been managed: Ewen has not cast him adrift and I know they have been speaking regularly, but the kid has to sort himself out and realise the team comes first. Deans's time was up, Ewen was the first in line, but none of us should ignore the difficulties he faces. The game here is not in a great place.\" McKenzie has been in charge for seven matches, three of which were against New Zealand and two against South Africa, the leading teams in the world rankings. Two victories over Argentina in the Rugby Championship averted the indignity of the wooden spoon and he has shown a ruthless streak, dropping the scrum-half Will Genia to the bench for two matches and this week stripping James Horwill of the captaincy. The fact they were two players he had enjoyed success with at the Reds for three years from 2010 will not have been lost on the squad: it is all about now. \"He has been very hard on the group,\" says Genia. \"There are no grey areas: you are either on the right side of the edge or you are not. The culture he is creating definitely affects the way you perform and play and I think that is being reflected in our matches, but it will take time. He was always big on discipline at the Reds and one of the first thing he did when taking charge of the Wallabies was to put in place protocols to ensure that everyone did the right thing.\" McKenzie had to wait a long time to secure the job he coveted. After retiring from playing in 1997, he immediately became a coaching co-ordinator at the Brumbies before three years later becoming an assistant coach of Australia, first to Bob Dwyer and then Eddie Jones. He took over as the head coach of the Waratahs in 2003, twice taking them to the Super Rugby final, leaving for an unhappy 15 months in Paris in 2008. Sacked after a poor run of results, having fallen out with the club president Max Guizzani, whom he accused of being more concerned about image than substance, he joined the Reds, turning a consistently poor side into a title-winning one within a year. \"I know the Australia job is a challenge but there will be nothing I am not expecting because I have seen it all before,\" says McKenzie. \"You have to have standards and expectations and I will put pressure on myself and the players. That said, it has to be fun to go to work. I've made it quite clear what's expected at this level and, as an ex-Wallaby, I have a very strong opinion on what that means. It is not about rebuilding the team but recalibrating it. We are making progress and I hope this trip will be good for that reason. The group is very tight and that is a characteristic I think will take us a long way.\" Australia in Deans's last couple of years lost their try-scoring potency, but in their last five halves of rugby they have scored 11, all coming away from home in South Africa, Argentina and New Zealand. Under McKenzie, the Reds, sparked by Genia and Quade Cooper, the outside-half who was sent into exile under Deans last year after describing the atmosphere in the Wallaby camp as toxic, gained a reputation for enterprise and daring, but when he was at the Waratahs, he was accused of shackling his players. \"Australia have been good in recent years at keeping hold of the ball but people are looking to Ewen to sharpen the attack and test teams defensively,\" adds Connolly. \"I think we have a very good chance against England, if only because we are match-hardened and they are not, but no one should be foolish enough to think that a coach can make all the difference. We have deep problems in our game, not least because there has been not enough emphasis on development. \"The Australian Rugby Union has over the years pursued a policy of giving money to players at the expense of investing in an equivalent of New Zealand's provincial championship or South Africa's Currie Cup. We have lost fewer players to Europe and Japan than them, but the ARU is now in a fix financially and the lack of depth could come [back] to haunt us. Ewen is the right man for the job and he will certainly change the way the Wallabies are perceived, but he needs help from those who can fix things he is not responsible for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
