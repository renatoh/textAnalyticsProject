Dennis G. of Balloon Juice makes the nice catch of reminding us all that: Perhaps the Nit Diddler is in the news today to help celebrate the 150 Anniversary of South Carolina's act of treason that put the Nation firmly on the path to Civil War. Yes! I'd forgotten about this story I read a couple of weeks ago: NAACP members and supporters plan to hold a peaceful march in downtown Charleston the day of the ball, on Dec. 20, followed by a meeting and question-and-answer session focusing on slavery. Participants will watch segments of \"Birth of a Nation,\" a 1915 silent film that portrayed Ku Klux Klan members as heroes. Nearby at Charleston's Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, ball attendees, who will pay $100 a ticket, will don formal, period dress, eat and dance the Virginia Reel as a band plays \"Dixie.\" The evening's highlight will be a play reenacting the signing of South Carolina's Ordinance of Secession 150 years ago, which severed the state's ties with the Union and paved the way for the Civil War. South Carolina's Ordinance of Secession was indeed adopted on this day in 1860. The ordinance itself is brief. What's longer is something called Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, which spells out the reasons for the drastic move. Did I say reasons? There's a fair amount of procedural gobbledygook, but then authors get to the heart of the matter, showing that there was one reason only really: The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\" This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River. The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States. The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. And so forth. I think you get the idea. And people are dressing up - TONIGHT, in YOOL 2011 - to commemorate a protest lodged against other states that wouldn't return slaves to South Carolina. And you ask me (some of you ask me, anyway) what I have against the South?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
