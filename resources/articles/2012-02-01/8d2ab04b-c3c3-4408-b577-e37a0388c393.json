The insurance company, RSA, sent an agent who, when she noticed we had a grandfather clock and piano, said we were underinsured. She asked copious questions and we heard nothing for months. When I finally made contact she blamed the delay on a deluge of claims following the snow and frost. A year went by before RSA offered me vouchers and a little cash for all my losses. I have refused the vouchers which are for some inferior store where I will never find anything to replace the jewellery. MC, Newry, County Down As well as commenting on your furniture, the loss adjuster questioned your claim because your policy did not list any high value items or jewellery worth more than \u00a31,500. As a result, RSA sent your claim to specialist underwriters. Whatever the complications, the process has taken a ridiculously long time and RSA admits to unacceptable delays, which it blames partly on the underinsurance, but says everyone involved is being retrained. You rejected the initial jewellery valuation of \u00a313,875 and wanted also to claim for your daughters' jewellery which was stolen but this isn't covered as they now live elsewhere. As the price of gold has gone up since the burglary, RSA obtained a new valuation, \u00a314,810, and offered this in cash instead of vouchers. As a goodwill gesture, it has waived the \u00a3100 excess and sent you an additional cheque for \u00a3250 plus a bouquet of flowers.
