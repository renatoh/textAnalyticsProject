Images of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, congratulating South African players in the changing room \u2013 including half-naked scrum-half Faf de Klerk \u2013 went viral on social media and was broadcast repeatedly by TV networks. The nation\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, due to fly back from Japan on Sunday after appearing with the team to lift the trophy, described \u201ca historic moment\u201d. \u201cThis historic win has been achieved with the passionate support of more than 57 million South Africans who have been inspired by the Springboks\u2019 performances throughout the tournament. \u201cThis is a powerful indicator of what we can achieve when we set goals for ourselves and we work together to achieve success,\u201d Ramaphosa, who took power last year, said.\u201cIt is a moment that is embedded forever in our national memory.\u201d Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel prize winner and leader of the decades-long struggle against the racist, repressive apartheid regime, said the Springboks had restored \u201ca self-doubting nation\u2019s belief.\u201d \u201cThe win has provided a welcome moment of optimism,\u201d Tutu said. \u201cThough there has been much progress since the dark days of apartheid, South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, and deep tensions between communities remain. \u201cViolent crime is a serious problem, with poor people most likely to be victims. There is deep public frustration with soaring unemployment, low economic growth, patchy delivery of basic services and widespread corruption. \u201cWe are a special country, and an extraordinary people. On days such as this we understand that when we pull together the sky is the limit. When we believe in ourselves we can achieve our dreams,\u201d Tutu said. Most newspapers and bulletins were still leading with the news of the win on Sunday morning. Many quoted the words of Kolisi, who grew up in deep poverty in Eastern Cape province and spoke immediately after the match of support from \u201cpeople in the taverns, in the shebeens, farms, homeless people ... and people in the rural areas.\u201d \u201cWe have so many problems in our country. But to have a team like this, we come from different backgrounds, different races and we came together with one goal.\u201d The history of rugby in South Africa \u2013 described as \u201cthe sporting embodiment of white minority rule\u201d \u2013 touches many of the most sensitive issues in a nation where historic grievances are still powerful. Kolisi is the first black captain of the Springboks, and the team fielded on Saturday was the most representative ever seen. The victory prompted jubilation in the clubs, pubs and squares across the country where supporters had gathered. \u201cBlack players proved that they are capable and that they were chosen for the squad on merit. The squad has made me feel proud as a black person and a South African today,\u201d said Mbongiseni Ntanjana, a supermarket worker from Epping near Cape Town, who watched the game in a crowded pub in the township of Khayelitsha. Sinethemba Tokhew, 31, said the victory would boost the image of the \u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019 across the world. \u201cPeople think of violence when they talk about South Africa. We too have been crying about this for too long, but now we are happy.\u201d The South African parliament also congratulated the Springboks for repeating \u201cthe uniting and nation-building effect the 1995 crop brought about to our nation\u201d, a reference to the South African victory 24 years ago. That day, Nelson Mandela handed the Webb Ellis Cup to captain Francois Pienaar at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The image of the two men became an iconic symbol of hope and reconciliation in the country\u2019s first years of democracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
