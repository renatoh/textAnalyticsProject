He won the New Hampshire primary in January, kickstarting his bid for the Republican nomination, and the state's four electoral college votes could be crucial if he is to have any chance of getting past the crucial 270 mark and into the White House. Romney's event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in downtown Manchester, alongside Kid Rock, was billed as a \"Final Victory Rally\" with more than 11,000 people expected to attend \u2013 despite freezing temperatures in the state over the past few days. Romney, who will appear with Kid Rock on Monday, has strong ties to New Hampshire. He has a summer home by Lake Winnipesaukee in the Wolfeboro area of the state and has spoken about the summers spent playing the inter-family \"Romney Olympics\" there. (Participants are limited to Romney family members, events include volleyball and tennis.) He was also governor of neighbouring Massachusetts as recently as 2006, although polls last month showed him losing Massachusetts by more than 16 points. Obama has claims on New Hampshire, too, having won by 9.6 points in 2008. He was here on Sunday, joined by Bill Clinton for a rally in Concord when 14,000 people turned out at the Statehouse as Obama vowed to protect college grants and his healthcare act if re-elected. Clinton, ever popular among a Democratic crowd, spoke for about 25 minutes after being introduced by New Hampshire's governor John Lynch. \"He's bringing along a rock star,\" Lynch said of Romney's Monday night event. \"Would you rather see Kid Rock or the Comeback Kid?\" The reference to Clinton's self-appointed nickname during his 1992 primary was well appreciated by the crowd. The late appearances by both candidates can perhaps be attributed to the fact that New Hampshire has no early voting \u2013 except by absentee ballot \u2013 so the majority of votes in the state will be cast on Tuesday. Another factor is the tightness of the race which remains too close to call. The latest WMUR poll here showed a two-point lead for Obama that is within the margin of error. Like Obama, Romney was here over the weekend, holding a rally at Portsmouth international airport on Saturday morning. Romney criticised Obama for having not kept the promises of 2008 while saying he would better handle the economy. \"New Hampshire got me the Republican nomination, and New Hampshire is going to get me the White House,\" Romney told the thousand-strong crowd. Obama will hope his ground network of volunteers can keep Romney at bay. The Obama campaign will hold get out the vote efforts at several locations in Manchester on both Monday and Tuesday. Volunteers are being encouraged to sign up for three or four hour shifts of phonebanking local residents, at venues including Southern New Hampshire University and a Teamsters HQ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
