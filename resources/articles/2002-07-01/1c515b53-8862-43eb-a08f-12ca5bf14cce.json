Julie Mellor, chair of the equal opportunities commission, said women make up a higher proportion of the retired population than men, and are already more likely to be living in poverty, forming three-quarters of the 1.7m pensioners on income support. She warned: \"This proposal would only make things worse for the many women who have not been able to build up an adequate independent retirement income.\" Alan Pickering's report, if adopted by ministers and included in a green paper later this year, will have wider ramifications. Mr Pickering also proposes abolishing the right to an index-linked pension income. Any employer seeking to cut costs by exercising its right to renegotiate this benefit will be telling workers their pension will decline in value over time. And as pensioners are living longer their pension will be worth a fraction of its original value when they die. Workers already on low wages and looking forward to meagre pensions will be the worst affected. They could also be the worst affected when their employer tells them joining the company scheme is a condition of employment. Many refuse to join an occupational scheme because they cannot afford the payments. They may feel that state benefits when they retire will prove higher than any small pension they might build up. In Mr Pickering's world that will be irrelevant, and they won't get the job unless they agree to pension contributions. Mr Pickering said these changes should make everyone take a more active interest in their pension provision and negotiate with their employer the benefits that should be offered. It could make job interviews longer as candidates wrestle with the technicalities of pensions along with the offer of private health insurance. The review says anybody who has been informed that their pension fund has contracted back into the state system - the state second pension, formerly Serps - could see themselves contracted out again as the conditions change. Ministers have been alarmed at the number of schemes that have contracted back into the state scheme, and Mr Pickering says his reforms will make it advantageous to take the state's money and contract out again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
