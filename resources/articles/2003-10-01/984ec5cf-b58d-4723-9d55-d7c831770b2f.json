The Fiver always knew that our chances of becoming a professional footballer were slimmer than Weird Uncle Fiver's collection of legal literature. But like the deluded fools we are, we never quite stopped clinging to the hope - the damnable, gut-wrenching, stomach-churning hope - that someone, somewhere would be stupid enough to splash out on a failed hack with two left feet and the tactical nous of Lord Cardigan. Roman Abramovich was the Fiver's last hope. But that was before we read the latest Chelsea shopping-list, cunningly masquerading as the morning's tabloid newspapers. If you believe what you read - and the Fiver doesn't recommend that you do - then Roberto Carlos is on his way from Real Madrid to west London, and possibly even to Chelsea, for an unfeasibly large sum of wonga that could guarantee Weird Uncle Fiver's bail at the drop of his special pleasure-mask. Tediously, one news agency decided to check the story by actually asking Carlos himself, which rather sticks in the throat. \"It could be that there is something,\" he smiled enigmatically, \"but I want to continue at Real Madrid, enjoying myself as I have up to now. They say I have had a meeting with Abramovich. But I don't speak Russian.\" Can't possibly have met him, then. But Abramovich has other fish to fry, including Manchester United's slippery eel Rio Ferdinand, who was too busy waiting to talk to an anonymous mobile-phone company's helpdesk to comment. One source suggests Ferdinand is missing Lahn' Tawn; another reckons he's simply the only player left in the Premiership who hasn't yet been linked with the bestubbled revolutionary. Then there's Juventus midfielder Pavel Nedved, whose apparent enthusiasm for the move was clinically squashed by his agent. \"The quotes weren't by him,\" he said, which means someone looking remarkably like Pavel Nedved is currently on the loose in the streets of Turin. Hmm ... face-lift ... fool Abramovich ... fulfil dream ... the Fiver'll show 'em ... who's laughing now? ... Eh? ... Eh? ... Oh. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Manchester United are second in the Championship and doing well in the Big Cup. Olympic Marseille are in exactly the same situation. For me, there is no difference between the two\" - Anyone else think Fabien Barthez is taking his loan move back to France badly? * * * * * * * * * * * * PLEAT GETS STUCK IN Despite being an illiterate imbecile, the Fiver's never had a problem with reading between the lines. Take, for example, this piece in today's Lahn' E'nin' Stanah', where Tottenham teddy-boy-cum-caretaker David Pleat pretends he wants to talk about Freddie Kanoute's injured ankle. \"Frederic's ankle is very sore but fears of a break seem unfounded etc., etc. and so on,\" drones Pleat, making no attempt to hide the agenda marked My Life As A Headhunter from prying eyes. \"Ah yes, that,\" chirped Pleat. \"Well the man we want [for the Tottenham job] has to fit a certain profile,\" and with that he whipped out a PowerPoint presentation and dimmed the lights. \"Would he represent Spurs well to the media? Is he a top coach? Would the players respect him? Is he a nutcase?\" Now the Fiver still can't work out whether being a \"nutcase\" would improve a man's chances of bagging the Spurs job, although it probably can't hurt. \"Those are the boxes I'm talking about,\" Pleat concluded, as Glenn Hoddle's face flashed across the screen. \"Tactically, this man was obsessed with the wing-back system but the players weren't comfortable with it,\" warned Pleat, striking the screen with his pointy pointer thing. \"I changed back to 4-4-2 immediately.\" Pausing briefly to high-five and backslap himself, Pleat was more than happy to go on: \"Because of his pride, Glenn wanted to be the best player in training every day - at 46 years of age!\" And on: \"Can you imagine Wenger playing with Henry and the rest?!\" And on again: \"Glenn wasn't judged on half-a-dozen games. It was an accumulation of all sorts of happenings and incidents.\" With friends like these, eh. Eh? * * * * * * * * * * * * WIN! WIN! WIN!

Wimbledon's orgie-engaging Nigel Reo-Coker is wanted by Everton, Fulham, Leeds, Portsmouth and Birmingham - and probably a few others, besides. Both Manchester United and Spurs are after Wales boss Mark Hughes: United want him as No2 to Fergie, Tottenham as their new man. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Alex Ferguson has been given a two-match touchline ban and been relieved of \u00a310K by the FA for throwing that hissy fit during Man Utd's game against Newcastle a wee while back. It's enough to make a grown man turn puce and start swearing and that. Oh. He might appeal. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard is going to try and talk striker Patrick Kluivert out of his strop. But if he can't, then the moody Dutch master can jolly well sling his proverbial. \"I want to shpeak with Patrick to shee how he feelsh and what it ish he wants,\" said Rijkaard. \"Depending on what he tellsh me, we'll shee whether it'sh better for him to go or shtop here.\" Gerard Houllier has continued his never-ending masterclass in self-delusion by claiming that his side can still win the title. \"It is still early in the season so I am not going to throw in the towel just yet,\" said Ged. Aston Villa skipper Olof Mellberg has called Bongo FC midfielder Robbie Savage \"stupid\" following the Brum derby yesterday. \"Savage was lucky to stay on the pitch,\" whined Mellberg. \"I don't want to complain, but he always gets away with it.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: The Premiership On Monday (12.25am) Another week, another Bad Job.

Football League Extra (1.45am) \"Having signed up for a local employment agency, with the promise of 'something in engineering', vaguely relevant to my degree course, I found myself at a sandwich factory in nearby Worksop.

Still, at least I managed to avoid the ridiculous 'beard-hammock' affair sported by the hairier-faced employees.

With a little probing, it turned out he'd taken it upon himself to drink from the chemical wash pipe used to clean the ingredients trays, and had gone home via hospital and a stomach pump. Eurosport: Eurogoals (6.30pm &amp; 11.15pm) \"The following day I was surprised to see him back in work, but opted not to probe further on what may have been a sensitive subject. It was obviously not too sensitive, because later that day he pulled the same stunt again.
