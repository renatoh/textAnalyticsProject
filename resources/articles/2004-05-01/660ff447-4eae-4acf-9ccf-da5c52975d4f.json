FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked Guardian political editor Michael White for his thoughts on today's session of prime minister's questions and the start of campaigning for the June 10 polls. \"Elections are looming. We heard a great deal from Labour MPs today. And then Alex Salmond, the SNP leader at Westminster, raised the emotive issue of post office closures - always a popular subject among voters. People hate to lose their sub-post offices - I should know, I'm losing mine as we speak, in west London. Tony Blair, when asked to do something about it, said this was really a matter for the Post Office. This is, of course, the right answer but won't do him much good among the voters. \"There were several questions of an electoral bent today - a Labour MP asked about child centres and the Sure Start programme in Warrington, Bob Blizzard asked about more money for \"school crossings patrollers\" or lollipop men and women to you and me, as they barely get paid more than they would on benefit. When Tory MP Laurence Robertson asked about a planning inspector's report about building houses in the flood plane outside Tewkesbury, Mr Blair admitted he knew nothing about this and that it wasn't in his briefing file - but he took the chance to say that under government legislation a million homes had been renovated and modernised since 1997. He even admitted that this had nothing to do with the point Mr Robertson was making, but it was in his file. And people laughed affectionately. \"Moving on to the larger issues of the day, Mr Howard asked the PM to condemn what he called the 'fake photographs' in the Mirror, which allege that British troops have assaulted Iraqi prisoners. There has been much controversy about their authenticity and Mr Blair wisely refused to comment before the army inquiry had taken his course. Mr Howard came back with a more interesting question about who would be responsible for security after the handover of power in Iraq on June 30. Did Mr Blair agree, the Tory leader wanted to know, 'ith the White House spokesman, who said the other day that 'full sovereignty\" would be transferred but with 'limited authority'. \"The PM said he agreed, rather, with Colin Powell, who had more diplomatically said 'full sovereignty' would be transferred and left it at that. But the question of security, he said, was still under negotiation. \"It's the anniversary this week, of course, of Margaret Thatcher's accession to power 25 years ago, after the vote of no confidence which brought down Jim Callaghan's Labour government. I was in the chamber that night, I'm afraid, and in the election campaign which followed I travelled around the country in a plane with Mrs T, though we all expected to be shot down by an IRA missile. To mark the anniversary, Steve McCabe, an MP for Birmingham, asked Mr Blair if there were any miserable aspects of 1980s and 1990s policy which he might spare the British people repeating. \"Now six or seven years ago, Mr Blair used to be fond of praising Mrs Thatcher just to show he was going to be tough on economic management and would try to keep down interest rates and unemployment. He doesn't think it's necessary to do that any longer - he's been prime minister in his own right for a long time - and he's determined to tar Mr Howard, who has begun to creep up on him in the polls, as a born again Thatcherite who would bring back all the worst aspects of Thatcherism. It was easy enough for Mr Blair to say he wouldn't bring back mass unemployment with 3 million unemployed when Mr Howard was in government, in contrast with 2 million new jobs under his Labour government. But politicians should never claim to have created new jobs because when those jobs disappear they tend to get blamed. So a careless use of language by Mr Blair - but obviously one he couldn't resist.\" LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION The Backbencher asked readers which MP has been badgering Ben Bradshaw with 450 questions about badgers - at a cost of more than GBP60,000. The correct answer, as James Meyrick writes, is North Shropshire's Owen Paterson. As Mr Paterson would probably argue, the total cost works out at about 19p per British badger - a bargain, frankly. And while we're talking statistics, a Scottish reader offers the following: \"The amount spent on badger questions would only buy 0.35 seconds of Iraq conflict expenditure. Now there's a best value argument.\" It would be, had Owen succeeded in his ghastly plan to decimate the badger population of North Shropshire. Curiously, when the Backbencher typed \"badger\" into the searchbox on Owen Paterson's website - which lists scores of the questions he has badgered other ministers with - the following text appeared: \"Lorem failure ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren.\" \"The rumour is that the questions are being drafted by a certain Dr North who helped write the 'not the FMD report' for Private Eye,\" writes a reader. \"I think the idea was to overwhelm the civil servants until Defra grinds to a halt, and the civil servants demand that the situation is ended.\" Civil servants demanding an end to something? Pull the other one. Still, it does raise the mildly diverting question: can you effectively filibuster an entire government department? On second thoughts, don't rush to answer that one. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION The Backbencher hesitates to comment on this week's prize, Bernard Ingham's The Wages of Spin (JohnMurray.co.uk), though it is undoubtedly an entertaining read and takes a few pops at the Guardian. For a chance of winning it, tell the Backbencher which job Mr Ingham took in the autumn of 1979. Yes, we're taking no chances here. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. GALE FORCE When a Tory MP has a shotgun, then a Tory MP really ought to be allowed to use it. And Roger Gale made a strong case for the \"Tony Martin\" defence in parliament last week. \"Sir William Blackstone,\" Roger intoned, \"said famously 'An Englishman's home is his castle.'\" Yes, Roger, but he didn't mean it literally. \"'Burglary is done at the dead of night,'\" Roger continued to quote, \"'when all creation except beasts of prey are at rest/ When sleep has disarmed the owner and rendered his castle defenceless.' That goes to the heart of the bill.\" Some might say that it ill behoves an MP with a penchant for civil liberties to advocate curfews. Still, if you see Roger out after dark, then there really is only one reasonable course of action. RULE: BUY THE BOOK An email arrives from the Labour party: \"CLPs - save GBP5!\" The Backbencher knew party recruitment was in a poor state, but this really is scraping the constituency kitty. \"Constituency parties can save themselves GBP5 and get a copy of the new rulebook in our members' section. It contains the new rules agreed at last year's conference and is a must-have for a successful CLP.\" Do they make themselves clear? Buy the rule book. Or else. COLOUR DUMB The Backbencher's allies in Washington report a breakthrough in Pentagon foreign policy. \"I believe that people whose skins aren't necessarily - are a different colour than white can self-govern,\" George announced last week. What a relief for Condi! Martin Luther King day was on January 19, by the way. LOOKING FOR SYMPATHY Stephen Pound (Ealing) is looking for a new researcher, but the Backbencher hesitates to recommend the job. \"Broad sympathy with the general aims and policies of the Labour party may be rare but would be treasured in an applicant for this position,\" Stephen writes on the Working 4 An MP website (http://www.w4mp.org). \"Interview dates to be confirmed if anyone applies for the job.\" DEADLY SERIOUS There's nothing like an attention-grabbing new initiative to help bury bad news, as David Blunkett is well aware. Yesterday the home secretary conceded that the ID cards trial had already run into technical difficulties. But there was no way a bit of technology was going to get in the way of a determined home secretary and his sniffer dog. It emerged that Mr Blunkett plans to keep the names and identities of the deceased on his hard drive in order to ensure that no one tries to resurrect the identity of a dead person, Day of the Jackal-style. Fair enough. But what will happen to people who join the great database in the sky before Mr Blunkett gets hold of their details? There's still ample time for someone to steal their identity, and gather the biometric data, too. Frankly, the soon-to-be-deceased are asking for trouble. So if you think that you might pass away in the next decade - for whatever reason - then you owe it to the Home Office to come forward right now and make yourself known. DEATHLY SILENT Speaking of civil liberties, let's turn to Liberty - the pressure group whose job it is to curb Mr Blunkett's worst excesses. Appalled by the news that the home secretary wanted to lower the burden of proof in criminal trials, a Backbencher reader joined Liberty on the spot at the beginning of February. An email arrived to thank him for his support: \"When we have processed your details, we will write to you to officially welcome you to Liberty.\" Since then, not a whisker. The Backbencher trusts the group to take care of members' personal details - but, really, the odd letter or message would be appreciated. AND FINALLY A word from George Foulkes, the Labour and Cooperative member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. \"Would the leader of the house consider a debate on the conduct of the media?\" George asked Peter \"They even make fun of the Big Conversation\" Hain. \"Such a debate would deal not with the gratuitous insults that you and I ... receive from the snooty scribblers in their sketches, but with the serious misrepresentations and falsehoods that regularly appear now.\" Bring it on, George. Bring it on. While we're talking falsehoods, could we talk WMD?
