Could we please revert to the situation whereby you bank with us, rather than vice versa?\u201d Nothing so simple in the complex world of banking and fintech. Consider the following from Andrew Beatty, senior vice president of global banking at FIS: \u201cBoth parties must apply constructive criticism appropriately... the fintech should not blindly accept all requested changes from the incumbent bank which could quickly take both parties off course and threaten the traction needed to progress in the engagement.\u201d Or this from Stephan Fabel, product director at Canonical: \u201cOnly by reducing network latency can the next generation of customer-facing services be realised within bank branches.\u201d It\u2019s all well beyond my financial capabilities and I\u2019m sure even my long-suffering bank manager of yore, who was a dab hand at customer-facing services, would be scratching his head. As he would by this proclamation from Matt Hancock, who the last time I looked was health secretary, but parked his tank on Penny Mordaunt\u2019s lawn in a foreign policy speech: \u201cThe future lies not in siloed services but in a full-spectrum, first-tier, day-one capability: special forces, cyber intelligence, working alongside the potential to project conventional hard power, combined with softer persuasive power, harnessed by a foreign policy steeped in diplomacy.\u201d Nuclear-strength eyewash, I think you\u2019ll agree, so Hancock, back to counting bedpans, please. To happier matters and a new word, to me at least \u2013 skeevier, the comparative form of skeevy, meaning morally or physically repulsive, disgusting, sleazy. Damned good word. Feel free to use as you will. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
