Romero, 28, spent last season on loan at Monaco from Sampdoria and impressed as the Argentina No1 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Roma are also targeting Romero, who is a free agent after leaving Sampdoria, but Van Gaal is hopeful of acquiring him. Vald\u00e9s will leave the club after the manager stated the 33-year-old had not adhered to his \u201cphilosophy\u201d. This was the reason cited for Vald\u00e9s not being selected for United\u2019s summer tour of America. Although David de Gea could still leave for Real Madrid, Romero would expect to be the No2 goalkeeper to whoever replaces him. The Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, who was Van Gaal\u2019s No1 when the coach led Holland at the World Cup, is a candidate to succeed De Gea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
