Lectures, bingo, fitness classes, drinks and more drinks; dressing up for dinner and, if you're lucky, meeting the captain; turns on the lurching deck and a world without horizons glinting all round you, day after day. It takes, apparently, six days to cross the Atlantic on the Transylvania; a small week where you can't escape and your mistakes come back to smack you in the face - a neat and obvious device for a comic novelist like Joseph Connolly who revels in loathsome behaviour and can be horribly funny about the lives people trap themselves in. Take several unhappy people, shake them up, twist them up, put opportunities in front of them, see what happens. By the middle of the trip I was wanting to jump ship. Sliding between several voices, in and out of drunken or nearly-sober monologues, on board Connolly's Transylvania is David, the sot of a husband who'd prefer to stay at home with his mistress but has been dragged along on this 'Trip of a Lifetime' (the phrase drips with vitriol by the end) by his wife Nicole, who's won it as a prize, and whose chief concern is dancing with the captain. With them, their son Rollo, who also begrudges coming, and obedient daughter Marianne. Then there's nearly-40-and-God-she-doesn't-want-to-be Jennifer, a furious creature from Absolutely Fabulous who's taking her 20-year-old daughter Stacy with her. There's the American family - a wife who spends her time in the luxury cabin packing, a husband who drinks crates of whisky with David and talks longingly of sex with younger women, until he discovers that David is having it off with his daughter Suki (who also has a thing with Stacy). Oh, and Dwight's son Earl, who has a fling with Jennifer until he discovers that she's nearly 40 and a mother, and that's gross. There's a pair of ship-bores who are twinkle-eyed, pedantic and impossible to offend; an assistant director of entertainment with a puce face and a heart full of self-pity and rage; a barmaid who ends up in bed with Rollo; and a seasick woman called Pat who turns out to be Trish, David's lover from England and, well, you get the picture. This is a world turned upside down, a world of farce, people hiding from other people, having sex with other people (with anyone, really, except the person they've come with), stuffing themselves with veal, talking to each other but not hearing, great gulfs as big as the ocean between them all. Eat, drink and be merry on this gilt-edged ship of fools. But the merriment is forced. Really this is world of self-disgust and anomie. There's not a happy person on board. And if Connolly lets them off the other end without too much destroyed - one person dies but nobody really cares - he doesn't offer fake redemption. David has fantasies of escape and reform, but won't; Nicole clings to her paltry hopes for a trip of a lifetime; Trish is passed like an old shoe from David to Dwight. So maybe life on the ship wasn't so different from firm ground after all. Comic writing is often bleak. Connolly's laughter is a snarl, a hoot, a howl."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
