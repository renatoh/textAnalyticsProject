In response to calls asking him to apologize, Biden said, \u201cApologize for what? Cory [Booker] should apologize. He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.

Today, the Senate confirmed the appointment of a federal judge who signed onto a letter that called being transgender a \u201cdelusion.\u201d 75 LBGT groups and their allies had publicly opposed his confirmation. Watch some of the key moments from today\u2019s Congressional debate over reparations: After facing criticism from his Democratic rivals all day, Joe Biden is pushing back on calls that he should apologize for his comments about his record of \u201ccivility\u201d with segregationist members of Congress. Asked about calls for him to apologize for his remarks, Biden said: \u201cApologize for what?\u201d \u201cCory should apologize,\u201d he added. \u201cHe knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in Civil Rights my whole career. Period.\u201d Biden told reporters he had been describing what it took for him to pass legislation, including extensions of the Voting Rights Act, despite opposition from segregationists. \u201cThe point I\u2019m making is: You don\u2019t have to agree. You don\u2019t have to like the people in terms of their views,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cBut you just simply make the case, and you beat them. You beat them, without changing the system.\u201d Matthew Kacsmaryk signed onto a letter that labeled being transgender a \u201cdelusion,\u201d and has opposed protections for LGBTQ people in housing, healthcare, and the Violence Against Women Act. Today, he was confirmed by the Senate to a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. Whatever happens in 2020, Trump and the Republican Party have used his first term years to remake the federal judiciary at every level. As context, the Huffington Post reported today, 1 in 5 of all of the nation\u2019s current circuit judges was nominated by Trump. More on Kacsmaryk from the Huffington Post.

A New Jersey Congressman has called on the State Department to reassess its travel advisory for the Dominican Republic after nine Americans tourists have died there, the last one just this week. More than two million American tourists visit the Dominican Republic each year, the New York Times reported, but the string of deaths has raised concerns and is under investigation. Lois Beckett here in the Oakland bureau, taking over today\u2019s live coverage of politics in the United States, where the past is never dead, it\u2019s not even past. \u201cDisingenuous.\u201d That\u2019s what a senior adviser to Joe Biden is calling the criticism of his remarks about his productive and \u201ccivil\u201d working relationship with a segregationist member of Congress. In a thread of tweets, Sanders noted that Biden was \u201cthe man who served as President Obama\u2019s VP, [and] the man who literally launched his 2020 campaign calling out Nazis in Charlottesville.\u201d Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, another 2020 contender, also called on Biden to apologize for his remarks. For the first time in more than a decade, Congress held a hearing on reparations, the idea of providing financial compensation to descendants of the enslaved. \u201cIt was 150 years ago and it is right now,\u201d said the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates.

Speaking at a post-congressional event organised by the ACLU at the Metropolitan AME church in Washington, Beckles said that the reparations movement was starting to bear fruit around the world. Commissions like his own in Caricom have formed and opened negotiations in Columbia, Costa Rica and Venezuela as well as the European Union and several West African countries from where slaves originally came. Beckles said that reparations was about making amends for nothing less than genocide. In his native Barbados, 600,000 slaves were imported to work in the sugar plantations but at the point of emancipation only 84,000 people of African descent remained. \u201cWhat else can you call that other than genocide?\u201d The historian said that the 21st century would be the century of reparations. \u201cIt took us 300 years to fight to end slavery. It took us a further 100 years to get civil rights written into law. It may take us all of the 21st century to do this, but we will not stop because slavery is not done until reparations are paid.\u201d \u201cLawmakers and their witnesses ranged over the legacy of slavery, the Jim Crow segregation that followed and modern scourges of mass incarceration, inequality and poverty that still plague African Americans,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, who attended a Congressional hearing on reparations in Washington DC today. Ed\u2019s full report is here: Federal authorities are investigating whether Deutsche Bank complied with laws meant to stop money laundering and other crimes, according to the New York Times: The investigation includes a review of Deutsche Bank\u2019s handling of so-called suspicious activity reports that its employees prepared about possibly problematic transactions, including some linked to President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, according people close to the bank and others familiar with the matter. The criminal investigation into Deutsche Bank is one element of several separate but overlapping government examinations into how illicit funds flow through the American financial system, said five of the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiries. Several other banks are also being investigated. Congress is also investigating Deutsche Bank because of its close relationship with Donald Trump and his family. \u201cDeutsche Bank has said that it is cooperating with government investigations and that it had been taking steps to improve its anti-money-laundering systems,\u201d the Times said. Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden is under fire for recalling his \u201ccivil\u201d working relationship with two segregationist and racist lawmakers: James Eastand, a Senator from Mississippi and Herman Talmadge, a Senator from Georgia. \u201cI was in a caucus with James O Eastland,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser in New York on Tuesday. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy\u2019; he always called me \u2018son.\u2019 \u201c Biden\u2019s competitors criticized the comments: New Jersey senator Cory Booker, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and California senator Kamala Harris. \u201cYou don\u2019t joke about calling black men \u2018boys,\u2019\u201d Booker said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cVice President Biden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone. I have to tell Vice President Biden, as someone I respect, that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together.\u201d Lawmakers have criticized the Trump adminstration\u2019s plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and a \u201cmajor setback.\u201d California attorney general, Xavier Becerra: President Trump\u2019s Dirty Power Plan is more than just disgraceful and immoral, it is unlawful. There is no justification for gutting a law that would have significantly reduced emissions and prevented thousands of premature deaths per year. While the Trump Administration might lack the necessary courage, we\u2019re prepared to confront the climate crisis head-on. The independent US senator from Maine, Angus King: There is a seemingly very boring, but very important, hearing tomorrow about the state of the Congressional Research Service, a public policy branch in the government that creates non-partisan reports for Congress. CRS has a positive reputation, but for the first time in more than a decade, the House will hold an oversight hearing to examine issues within the agency. According to Roll Call: Andie Wyatt worked at CRS from 2015 to 2018 as a legislative attorney in the American Law Division, with a focus on environmental law. She said there was a culture of management avoiding pushback at all costs without any accounting for whether the pushback was accurate. \u201cFrom the perspective of an attorney working on climate matters in 2017 and 2018, there was a lot of pressure not to imply too directly that the Trump administration, and Republican position against climate science, was wrong,\u201d Wyatt said. She added that clear statements about climate risks and science were \u201cwatered down\u201d either in the editing process or preemptively by authors who anticipated their language would be diluted... ... Stephen Dagadakis, a CRS spokesman, said in a statement that \u201cCRS is committed to providing Congress with research and analysis of the highest quality. We address the full range of issues before Congress, including topics that are controversial, and believe the work stands for itself.\u201d The author and professor of history and international relations at American University, Ibram X Kendi, writes for the Atlantic on the Americans who oppose reparations: Americans who prefer gradual approaches that do not radically disrupt inequality and who label their approaches \u201cplain, peaceful, generous, just,\u201d to use Lincoln\u2019s words, carelessly ignore or understate the complex, violent, stingy, and unjust damage wrought by inequality. These Americans care more about responding to political expediency than the emergency of inequality, care more about repairing alienated white Americans than repairing pillaged black coffers, and claim to be horrified by slavery and \u201cnot racist\u201d but end up, knowingly or unknowingly, compensating the white beneficiaries of slavery and racism. These Americans claim they oppose racism and reparations. They support the drive for economic equality between the races at the same time they are pumping the breaks on the only foreseeable policy that can dramatically close the growing racial wealth gap between the races. Only an expansive and expensive compensation policy for the descendants of the enslaved and relegated of the scale Lincoln proposed for the enslavers and subsidized could prevent the racial wealth gap from compounding and being passed onto another generation. The New York Times put the same 18 questions to 21 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including \u201cDoes anyone deserve to have a billion dollars?\u201d \u201cWould there be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of your first term?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your comfort food on the campaign trail?\u201d On the billionaire question, Kirsten Gillibrand was the only person to definitively say \u201cno.\u201d The Afghanistan questioned saw all candidates say they would pull back troops, with only Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker vowing a full exit. Turns out a few candidates are vegan (Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard) and Bernie Sanders put on some weight the last time he was on the campaign trail so he says: \u201cthere\u2019s too much comfort food.\u201d Rally recap The Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief, David Smith, was in Orlando last night for Donald Trump\u2019s rally to formally launch his 2020 presidential re-election bid. Smith writes: Trump spent little effort offering a vision of the future. He and his supporters were most energised by his greatest hits: grievance politics, demonising opponents, raging against perceived injustices. There was even a reprise of attacks on Hillary Clinton, his defeated rival in 2016, complete with furious chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d His vicious, often fabricated, attacks implied that while a referendum on his record would likely end in defeat, his campaign believes that whipping up fear of a Democrat in the White House could yet save his skin. Outside the rally, Richard Luscombe kept watch on the supporters and protestors, who came out in droves: A happy crowd danced and sang to live music in the rain, but the carnival atmosphere was marred by the appearance of several dozen of apparent members of the Proud Boys, a far-right organization deemed by the Southern Poverty Law Center to be a hate group. Marching from the Amway Center chanting, many wearing Maga hats and some making white power gestures, the group was intercepted by City of Orlando police officers outside the bar. The officers spread their bicycles across the road as a barricade. And Adam Gabbatt, reporting from Orlando, has got the top takeaways from the rally, including \u201cTrump has no plans to turn forward the clock\u201d and \u201cA big crowd in Orlando \u2026 but early departures.\u201d The judiciary sub-committee hearing in Washington on reparations has just wrapped up. It\u2019s been a lively debate - at times heated - with the full hearing room echoing occasionally with cheers for those advocating for making amends for slavery and at other times loud booing when Republican lawmakers and their witnesses dismissed the idea. The final word came from the Democratic sponsor of HR 40, the House bill calling for a government study of reparations, and her key witness. Sheila Jackson Lee, representative from Texas who has sponsored HR 40 since 2017, said that the debate around reparations was real and very much rooted in the present day. \u201cWe are not here on a temporary pass doing temporary work,\u201d she said. The job was to correct the errors of the past and enshrine that correction into law. Her key witness, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates, said that the common theme through all this morning\u2019s discussion was theft. Slavery was theft of black labor, Jim Crow segregation was theft of black property, and today \u201cif you deny my ability to vote and participate in the political process you have effectively stolen from me\u201d. None of this was a passive process, he said as the debate closed. \u201cIt was a conscious taking from one group to give to another by the state.\u201d In the wake of Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 appearance at the reparations hearing, it\u2019s worth looking back at his interview with The New Yorker about reparations published earlier this month. Several Democratic presidential candidates have issued support for reparations, and Cory Booker was at the hearing, but Coates said in the interview that Elizabeth Warren was the candidate he thought was most serious when they talk about reparations. An excerpt from that interview: The New Yorker: In what way? Coates: I think she means it. I mean\u2014I guess it will break a little news\u2014after \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d came out, she just asked me to come and talk one on one with her about it. TNY: This is five years ago, when your piece came out in The Atlantic? C: Yeah, maybe it was a little later than that, but it was about the time. It was well before she declared anything about running for President. TNY: And what was your conversation with Elizabeth Warren like? C: She had read it. She was deeply serious, and she had questions. And it wasn\u2019t, like, Will you do X, Y, and Z for me? It wasn\u2019t, like, I\u2019m trying to demonstrate I\u2019m serious. I have not heard from her since, either, by the way. TNY: Have you talked to any candidates about it? C: No. For the first time in a decade, Congress today is holding a hearing on reparations, the idea of providing financial compensation to descendants of the enslaved. Trump\u2019s administration is finalizing its plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not censure Donald Trump, a move that is a step down from launching impeachment proceedings. The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, should be investigated over the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi because there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he and other senior officials are liable for the killing, according to a UN report published this morning. Hope Hicks, former White House communications director, is the first witness in the House investigation into the Mueller report\u2019s findings on whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hope Hicks is refusing to answer questions related to her time in the White House in an interview with the House Judiciary Committee, according to Democrats in the closed-door meeting. \u201cShe\u2019s objecting to stuff that\u2019s already in the public record,\u201d California Representative Karen Bass, told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous.\u201d Pramila Jayapal, a representative from Washington, called it \u201ca farce.\u201d In a letter to Nadler, White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote that Trump directed Hicks not to answer questions \u201crelating to the time of her service as a senior adviser to the president.\u201d California representative, Ted Lieu, who is tweeting his personal highlights from the interview, is not impressed: An inside look at Coates\u2019 testimony from the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, who is at the reparations hearing: Before I get into Coates\u2019s criticism, a quick word about where we\u2019re sitting. Coates delivered his address in front of the assembled members of the sub-committee on the constitution, civil rights and civil liberties. Half the bench of lawmakers consists of Democrats, and their seats are all full. Half the bench consists of Republicans, and their seats are almost entirely empty. Which speaks volumes about how the modern conservative movement views the subject of making amends for slavery. Yesterday the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell made a statement in which he dismissed in curt terms the very idea of reparations. \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\u201d McConnell said. That clearly made Coates see red. His address grew angrier and angrier, his disdain for McConnell\u2019s posture more pointed and personal. The Republican leader may not have been around 150 years ago, but he was around for the aftermath, he said. \u201cFor a century after the Civil War black people were subjected to a relentless campaign of terror, a campaign that extended well into the lifetime of majority leader McConnell.\u201d McConnell may not have been there for the Battle of Appomattox at the end of the Civil War, \u201cbut he was alive for the execution of George Stinney, he was alive for the blinding of Isaac Woodard.\u201d Stinney was aged 14 when he was executed by electric chair in 1944 after a trial for the murder of two white girls that was later overturned as unfair. Woodard was blinded in an attack by South Carolina police in 1946 \u2013 he was still in uniform having recently been honorably discharged from the US Army as a World War 2 veteran. Coates went on to say of McConnell: \u201cHe was alive for the red-lining of Chicago and the looting of black homeowners of some $4bn. Victims of their plunder are very much alive today \u2013 I\u2019m sure they would love a word with the majority leader.\u201d Back to the reparations hearing, where Sheila Jackson Lee, a congresswoman from Texas who is the current sponsor of the House reparations bill HR 40, delivered sober statistics on why she supports reparations. Number of Africans who were transported by force across the Atlantic in the slave trade: 10 to 15m Number of slaves who died during the Middle Passage: 2m For every 100 slaves who reached the New World, another 40 died on route Then the congresswoman went on to give a set of equally chilling statistics from today: 1m African Americans are incarcerated Black unemployment stands at 6.6%, more than double the national rate 31% of black children live in poverty, also more than twice the national average \u201cI am not here in anger, I am not seeing to encourage hostilities,\u201d Jackson Lee said. But she added: \u201cThe role of the federal government in supporting the institution of slavery is an injustice that must be formally acknowledged and addressed.\u201d She said that today\u2019s debate was not symbolic. It was the first step towards legislative action that should see her bill, HR 40, move to the floor of the House and the Senate and eventually be signed into law by the US president. Donald Trump has raised nearly $25m for his re-election in less than 24 hours, according to the Republican National Committee. He is also planning to use US military planes fly over the mall for the Fourth of July celebrations, according to the Washington Post: Under the arrangements, Trump would not be on board the presidential Boeing jetliner as it flew overhead, the people familiar with the plans said. The White House, which declined to comment Tuesday, has provided few details on how it plans to change the long-standing celebration of Independence Day in the nation\u2019s capital. The Washington Post reported in May that the president plans to speak on July 4 at the Lincoln Memorial in an event dubbed \u201cSalute to America,\u201d a move that has shifted the National Park Service\u2019s fireworks launch from the reflecting pool area to West Potomac Park. Emily Holden, an environment reporter at the Guardian, has the full story on Donald Trump\u2019s administration finalizing its plans to roll back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet: Joe Goffman, a Harvard professor and former EPA general counsel, called EPA\u2019s legal arguments \u201ctortured\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d. Goffman said the rule \u201cdemonstrates the Trump administration\u2019s determination not only to avoid taking action to address climate change but also to obstruct current and future efforts by states and successors to cut greenhouse gas pollution\u201d. Democratic-led states and environment advocates are expected to challenge the rule in lawsuits. Trump\u2019s agency argues it does not have legal authority to regulate climate change. If the courts agree, future US climate efforts could be in jeopardy. Coal plant air pollution \u2013 from tiny particles that enter the lungs \u2013 cause breathing problems and early deaths. According to an earlier estimate from EPA, the new rule could lead to 1,400 more deaths each year. Coleman Hughes, a columnist at the online magazine Quillette, is now testifying against reparations. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our time debating a bill that mentions slavery only 25 times and incarceration only once,\u201d Hughes says, noting that there are no slaves and more than 2 million black people incarcerated. Hughes said he was encouraged by nearly everyone else he knew not to testify today, because he would anger both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cIf we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further,\u201d Hughes said. He advocates for reparations to people who lived under Jim Crow, but not for descendants of slaves. \u201cPeople who are owed for slavery are no longer here,\u201d Hughes said. At the end of his testimony, he is met with a few boos from the crowd, prompting the committee chair to call on people to be respectful to all those testifying. At the reparations hearing, Ta-Nehisi Coates begins his testimony by quoting senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky who said Tuesday that he opposes reparations, telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t want reparations for something that happened 150 years ago.\u201d Coates notes that the families of Civil War veterans received payments well after the war and that the US honors treaties that date back 200 years. \u201cMany of us would love to be taxed for the things we are solely and individually responsible for,\u201d Coates says, noting that is not how the American project works. His testimony is impassioned and directed at McConnell. He lists the myriad, systemic crimes against black people that have happened in McConnell\u2019s lifetime and notes that people impacted would surely \u201clove a word with the majority leader. \u201c Donald Trump\u2019s administration is taking another big step on Wednesday in rolling back the US government\u2019s only direct efforts to curb coal-fired power plant pollution that is heating the planet. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency will replace an Obama-era climate change rule with a regulation that academic and health experts warn could help some of the oldest, dirtiest coal plants keep running. Obama\u2019s rule, the Clean Power Plan, would have pushed power companies to shift away from coal and toward natural gas and renewable power. Trump\u2019s rule lays out ways states could direct coal plants to increase their efficiency, with hardware fixes or operational changes. Trump\u2019s rule will not significantly address the heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere and causing more extreme heat waves, floods and other disasters. And it will lead to higher levels of air pollution, compared with the Clean Power Plan. But the Trump administration is defending the change, arguing it is limited by law in how it can regulate the emissions that cause rising temperatures. The Guardian\u2019s chief reporter, Ed Pilkington, is at the Congressional hearing on reparations, which takes place on Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the emancipation of slaves in the US. I\u2019m in a House judiciary committee room in the Rayburn building in Washington and already the setting is buzzing. The corridor is jam packed with people, overwhelmingly African American, hoping to grab one of the public seats for the first congressional hearing to be held in 12 years on what has become this year\u2019s hot topic \u2013 reparations for slavery. The exceptional turnout for the event which has just started is a sign of passions running high ahead of the 2020 presidential elections in which many of the 23 Democratic candidates have embraced the idea of atoning for America\u2019s original sin. A couple of the presidential candidates are likely to speak too: Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey, who has introduced a senate bill calling for the creation of a government commission, is at the hearing, as is Eric Swalwell, a California congressman who is a member of the sub-committee that has called the hearing. I\u2019ve just been speaking to people standing in line in the packed corridor, asking them what they are hoping to hear today. Kenniss Henry, a member of one of the oldest pro-reparations groups, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, said she was hoping that the hearing would give enough of a push in Congress that the reparations bill, HR 40, would finally get a full debate on the floors of both the House and Senate \u2013 something that has proved elusive for the past 30 years. The most touching comment came from Khalab Blagburn, aged 13. He recently spoke at a debate at his local high school in which he argued all black people in America today and not just the descendants of slaves should be compensated, because the fall-out of slavery had impacted them all. I asked him whether, as a teenager, he was confident he would have a fair chance of realizing his dreams in America when he grows up. He replied: If I work hard and continue to pursue my passions I think I can be successful. But I know I face greater obstacles in the road in front of me than my white school friends. That, in a nutshell, is what today\u2019s historic hearing is all about. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not censure Donald Trump, a move that is a step down from launching impeachment proceedings. Some Democrats floated censure as an alternative to impeachment because of Pelosi\u2019s firm stance against holding such proceedings. \u201cNo. I think censure is just a way out,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at a breakfast briefing. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna go, you gotta to go. In other words, if the goods are there, you must impeach, and censure is nice, but it is not commensurate with the violations of the Constitution should we decide that\u2019s the way to go.\u201d She said she doesn\u2019t feel pressure from Democratic House members \u201cto do anything.\u201d The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, should be investigated over the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi because there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he and other senior officials are liable for the killing, according to a UN report published this morning. The 100-page analysis concludes Saudia Arabia is responsible under international human rights law for the extrajudicial killing of Khashoggi at the Istanbul consulate in October 2018. Agnes Callamard, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur, asked the US to make a determination under the US law on the responsibility of the crown prince for Khashoggi\u2019s death. This is complicated for the US because Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has close ties with the crown prince. Hope Hicks, former White House communications director, is the first witness in the House investigation into the Mueller report\u2019s findings on whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

For the first time in a decade, Congress today is holding a hearing on reparations, the idea of providing financial compensation to descendants of the enslaved. Among those testifying today is writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose seminal piece for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, re-invigorated the push for reparations alongside the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. Congress will also hold a closed-door hearing with Hope Hicks, the former White House official and Trump campaign official, to discuss Russian interference in the 2016 election. House Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler said a transcript of the meeting will be made public. Speaking of the Trump campaign, the president held a rally last night to mark the official launch of his re-election bid. The Florida rally contained the president\u2019s usual mix of falsehoods and anger - we\u2019ll have reactions to that later this morning and a recap is here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
