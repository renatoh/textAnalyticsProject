A remote coffee-growing village in the Mexican mountains, its repeated requests for a mobile mast were declined by telecom giants who thought it would yield small beans. Costly calls had to be made from borrowed landlines in the middle of shops, while urgent communications were bellowed through a Tannoy for the whole village to hear. Undaunted and desperate, the 2,500 citizens created their own phone company, using radio receivers, a laptop and open-source software, with signed paper receipts serving as pre-pay credit. The cut-price system only supports 11 calls at once, but that's a huge advance for a community unused to making \"I'm on the bus\" type calls. If the millions who live in parts of the world without modern communications follow this self-starting lead, big corporates will one day regret refusing to answer Talea de Castro's call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
