In one of the worst IT problems to hit Britain\u2019s banking sector in years, TSB took all its internet and mobile services offline for emergency repair work, after a migration to a new platform over the weekend backfired. TSB\u2019s chief executive, Paul Pester, apologised for the chaos on Tuesday morning, promising that services would resume by the afternoon and that \u201cno one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues\u201d. But at the end of the working day, and with TSB branches closed, customers were still unable to access their accounts online. Customers reported waiting for more than an hour to get through to the phone banking service. Owners of small businesses said they were unable to pay salaries or manage transactions, while some account holders found all their direct debits had disappeared. Lee MacDonald, a former actor who starred as Zammo in Grange Hill, was among the small business owners affected. He said his company, Mentor Lock and Safe Company, in Wallington, south London, had \u201cliterally stopped\u201d. In TSB branches, some customers were told it could be another 48 hours before they could access their accounts properly, while the bank\u2019s website said some issues, such as one-time passwords and Isa transfers, would be fixed by the end of April. The crisis began on Friday night, when TSB began a long-planned migration of 1.3bn customer records away from former parent company Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s IT systems, on to a platform created by TSB\u2019s new Spanish owners, Sabadell. The job should have been completed by 6pm on Sunday. Pester admitted that, in one glitch, customers were shown entries in other accounts: \u201c402 customers could see some data that we would not normally show them online.\u201d While most TSB account holders had been able to continue using their debit cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, many alleged the problems were deeper than the bank was admitting. Outside a branch in the City of London, Mac, a retired photographer, said he was appalled by the bank\u2019s problems. \u201cAll my direct debits have disappeared,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were there yesterday but gone today. And there\u2019s something saying the last payment was in 2099. I\u2019ve also had to change my password to get into the account. \u201cThe thing that most infuriates me is the statements coming out of the bank. They are not being honest. They keep saying it\u2019s \u2018intermittent\u2019 when it\u2019s not. At first I tried to phone. I was on the line for an hour but then gave up and came down here. They have told me it will be sorted out in 48 hours from today, but I don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d Alex, who runs a professional consultancy firm, said outside the branch: \u201cI have salaries to pay today. I\u2019ve had to come down here to arrange for a bulk transfer over to HSBC, and we\u2019ll have to pay the salaries from there. \u201cI tried calling the helpline, but after a while the line just goes blank. We\u2019ve had grief with them ever since we were moved from Lloyds. They\u2019re not really a business bank.\u201d Many have called for compensation similar to the \u00a370m RBS paid out after the previous big IT meltdown in banking in 2012. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, has written to Pester to demand answers; he will also contact the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). \u201cThis is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. \u201cWarm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.\u201d Multimillion-pound bonuses to Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff, which were dependent on the IT migration, are now under threat. The payouts, which include a \u00a31.6m bonus for Pester, were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move from Lloyds to Sabadell last year. TSB\u2019s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay the bonuses. The FCA and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said they were investigating the problems. They have the power to fine TSB for the botched system upgrade and data breaches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
