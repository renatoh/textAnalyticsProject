We are not born equal.\" Whether or not you agree with this, governors face a deluge of paperwork and fresh consultations as a new round of legislation on equality puts our responsibilities to the test. On April 6, the Gender Equality Duty comes into force and schools, along with all other public authorities in England, Wales and Scotland, must demonstrate that they are promoting equality for women and men, and eliminating sexual discrimination and harassment. The duty, which is supported by information on the equal opportunities website, reinforces many of the ways governors are already ensuring that pupils and employees get fair treatment. However, if you are a primary school governor the chances are that you will have far more female staff than male, so the issue of \"avoiding concentration of women and men into particular areas of work and addressing it where it already exists ('occupational segregation')\" is almost impossible to address. Meanwhile, last December's Disability Equality Duty means all secondary schools should have an action plan in place - primary schools have until December 3. Governors must oversee how the school will expand access to education for disabled pupils. That includes increasing how they can participate in the curriculum, improving the school environment for them, and finding ways to communicate other than in a written form given to non-disabled pupils. The third strand of governors' responsibility involves racial discrimination, as laid down in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Governors are urged to assess and monitor the impact of their school's race equality policy on pupils, staff and parents, and schools must record racist incidents and report them to their local authority. Feeling rather overwhelmed by all this? The DfES, which has produced an equality toolkit on teachernet.gov.uk, recommends that schools produce a single \"equality plan\" that embraces gender, disability and race. Many schools will find they are already complying with much of the guidance. However, I would warn governors not to overlook the obvious. After all, what is the point in pages of detailed guidance on equality if you haven't got a ramp up the front steps of the school and you don't let the girls play football? A toolkit, Legislation on Equality and Diversity, can be downloaded from teachernet.org.uk. More information is available from www.eoc.org.uk.
