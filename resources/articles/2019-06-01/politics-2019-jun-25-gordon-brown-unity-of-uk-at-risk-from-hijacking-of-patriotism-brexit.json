Warning against a no-deal Brexit, the former Labour prime minister said the Conservative party had turned what would be an act of economic self-harm into a test of patriotism. He also became the latest high-profile political figure to advocate the use of citizens\u2019 assemblies to overcome the deadlock and confusion around Brexit, calling for the labour movement to take a lead on this if government and other parties failed to do so. Speaking at an event organised by the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate and the Fabian Society, Brown said: \u201cThe country is about to choose the next prime minister but missing so far from the Conservative leadership contest is a serious debate on the biggest existential question of all \u2013 the unity of the United Kingdom and the future of the union \u2013 and how to prevent an even more damaging descent into divisive nationalisms.\u201d In remarks trailed ahead of the speech at Westminster Cathedral Hall, Brown warned: \u201cI believe the union is today more at risk than at any time in 300 years \u2013 and more in danger than when we had to fight for it in 2014 during a bitter Scottish referendum.\u201d \u201cIn jeopardy are both the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom and the shared values \u2013 tolerance, respect for diversity, being outward looking \u2013 that underpin what, for all its ups and downs, has been the most successful example of multinational co-operation anywhere in the world.\u201d Brown, who was a key figure in the campaign for a no vote during the Scottish independence referendum, also said the UK was under threat from what he said was a \u201crecent but little-publicised shift\u201d by the SNP from a soft to hard version of independence. This was accompanied by the party\u2019s abandonment of the pound and its desire to leave the UK single market and customs union. \u201cAnd it is under threat from the growing scorn for the union from the Conservative party membership and from the favourite to be prime minister, Boris Johnson.\u201d Brown spoke for more than half an hour without notes before an invited audience at an event where he took pre-submitted questions, concluding his speech on a call for a debate about Britishness. A failure to be explicit about what Britishness stood for had been one of the factors which had led to the rise of narrow nationalism, he said. However, he walked away when the Guardian tried to ask him afterwards if he had any regrets for his pledge to \u201ccreate British jobs for British workers\u201d, which sparked a furore when he made it. Opponents branded it meaningless, racist and even illegal under EU law. At the time of strikes by workers who walked out of refineries and power stations in various parts of the UK in protest over the use of foreign rather than domestic labour, Brown\u2019s remarks had been used on placards and also referred to by the far right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
