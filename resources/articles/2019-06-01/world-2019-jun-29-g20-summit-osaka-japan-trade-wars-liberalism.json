The G20 nations, Abe said, \u201chave a responsibility to squarely face global problems and to come up with solutions through frank dialogue\u201d. Their communique, which had looked in doubt 24 hours earlier as the EU and the US sparred over how to describe the climate crisis, went some way towards meeting his demands. Their compromise enabled 19 of the 20 leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris agreement, but left enough room for Washington to attempt to justify its increasing isolation from the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a reference to the harm it would inflict on \u201cAmerican workers and taxpayers\u201d. The \u201cfrank dialogue\u201d Abe craved proved more problematic, however. The opening day of the summit was overshadowed by the China-US trade war, the presence of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and for British audiences at least, Theresa May\u2019s confrontation with Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Putin had already angered Donald Tusk, among others, by declaring in a Financial Times interview published at the start of the summit that liberalism was obsolete. It was a theme he returned to on Saturday evening, when he claimed that immigration had infringed on other people\u2019s rights, and attributed Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory to disenchantment with mainstream liberal ideals. \u201cThe liberal idea has started eating itself,\u201d Putin told reporters in Osaka. \u201cMillions of people live their lives, and those who propagate those ideas are separate from them. People live in their own country, according to their own traditions, why should it happen to them?\u201d But as the G20 leaders headed home, there was also cause for cautious optimism. Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, stepped back from the trade war precipice \u2013 at least for now \u2013 during their highly anticipated meeting, while all but one of the G20 leaders decided not to cross French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on the climate crisis and included a reference to their \u201cirreversible\u201d obligations under the Paris agreement. There was also a commitment to stop adding to plastic waste pollution of the world\u2019s oceans by 2050. Inevitably, it was left to Donald Trump to take some of the sheen off Japan\u2019s first G20 summit with a Saturday morning tweet that set off speculation he was about to meet North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, along the heavily armed peninsula that has divided the Korean peninsula for 55 years. Trump proposed that he and Kim leader meet at the demilitarised zone [DMZ] to shake hands and \u201csay hello\u201d during his visit to South Korea on Sunday. North Korea described the offer as very interesting, but said it had yet to receive an official invitation. \u201cI am of the view that if the [North Korea-US] meetings take place on the division line, as is intended by President Trump, it would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations,\u201d North Korea\u2019s KCNA news agency quoted the country\u2019s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, as saying. Trump told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll be there and I just put out a feeler because I don\u2019t know where he is right now. He may not be in North Korea. If he\u2019s there, we\u2019ll see each other for two minutes, that\u2019s all we can, but that will be fine.\u201d He said he would have no problem stepping into North Korea if he met Kim for a handshake and to \u201csay hello\u201d. Trump stepping over the line of demarcation separating North and South Korea would be hugely symbolic, echoing a similar gesture made by the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in \u2013 with Kim\u2019s encouragement \u2013 when they met at the DMZ last year. \u201cSure I would, I would. I\u2019d feel very comfortable doing that. I\u2019d have no problem,\u201d Trump said, adding that he believed Kim followed his Twitter account. \u201cI guess he does because we got a call very quickly,\u201d he said. If Kim accepts the invitation it will be the leaders\u2019 first meeting since their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi in February ended without an agreement. Some North Korea watchers interpreted Choe\u2019s comments as a sign that the meeting will go ahead. Commenting on the KCNA reports, John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, tweeted: \u201cNot to put too fine a point on it, but this is North Korean for \u2018yes\u2019\u201d. The South\u2019s presidential Blue House said nothing had been confirmed at this point and added: \u201cOur position, which hopes for a dialogue between the US and North Korea to take place, remains unchanged.\u201d Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced a comprehensive agreement that would see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. But a photo opportunity on the DMZ, no matter how symbolic, is unlikely to go far in resolving their differences on denuclearisation, according to Scott Seaman, director of Eurasia Group Asia. \u201cFor talks to have real legs, either Kim must credibly commit to denuclearisation or Trump must credibly agree to allow Kim to keep some of his nuclear weapons,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cWithout a shared end goal, creating a viable roadmap to reaching it will remain impossible.\u201d Hours after making his impromptu overture to Kim \u2013 and months after their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi ended in failure \u2013 Trump emerged from a meeting with Xi to declare that US trade negotiations with China were \u201cright back on track\u201d. He said the US would not impose further tariffs in an ongoing trade war that other world leaders had said could threaten the global economy, and added that the world\u2019s two biggest economies would restart negotiations on a trade deal. The US president told a press conference that he and his Chinese counterpart had had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won\u2019t be adding additional [tariffs] \u2026 We\u2019re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they\u2019re going to start doing that almost immediately.\u201d Trump had said at the start of the meeting that he was open to a \u201chistoric fair trade deal\u201d with China. \u201cWe are totally open to it,\u201d he told Xi, who called for \u201ccooperation and dialogue\u201d instead of confrontation. Trump added: \u201cWe want to do some things that will even it up with respect to trade. We were very close but something happened where it slipped up a little bit,\u201d in a reference to the failure of previous talks. In their declaration, the G20 leaders avoided criticism of Trump-style protectionism but committed themselves to realising \u201cfree, fair and non-discriminatory\u201d trade and to \u201ckeep our markets open\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
