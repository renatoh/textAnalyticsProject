There had been suggestions of Real Time Snicko being introduced as an additional aid after the International Cricket Council's board meeting in London, and Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, had demanded in the immediate aftermath of the series at The Oval that the bad light regulations must be changed. But the only reference to either issue in the official statement released on Saturday after the meeting was that the board \"noted the discussions [of the ICC's chief executives committee last month in Dubai] on a number of issues, including maintaining the current playing conditions for ODI cricket and bad light, and the Decision Review System (DRS)\". The chief executives had \"endorsed the umpires' intention to become far stricter on poor over-rates and time wasting and to maximize playing time in conditions where it is safe to do so\", but without making the changes to playing conditions that would seem necessary to make any impact. Similarly, they had endorsed \"an independent assessment\" of Real Time Snicko, but as things stand, the only change in the DRS for the return Ashes series will be the removal of Hot Spot as an aid to detecting thin edges, after it was dropped by the broadcasters Channel Nine. The board also deferred any decision about easing the five-year ban imposed on the young Pakistani bowler Mohammad Amir for his involvement in the spot-fixing uncovered by the News of the World in 2010 until a \"more robust\" anti-corruption code is discussed at their next meeting, in January. Uncertainty also remains over the schedule of the World Twenty20 competition that is due to be held in Bangladesh next spring. Rumours that the whole tournament could be switched to South Africa because of the lack of suitable stadia in Bangladesh would now appear to have been scotched, but there is still a possibility of some games being switched to Eden Gardens in Kolkata, India, if the new ground in Sylhet is not completed to the necessary standards in time for the start of the competition next March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
