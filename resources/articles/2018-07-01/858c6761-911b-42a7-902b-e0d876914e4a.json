Southgate was reminiscing about a scratchy 1-0 win against Slovenia last October when the overriding memory was not Harry Kane\u2019s late winner but the sour indifference of the crowd and the jarring sight of thousands of fans feeling it necessary to make their own entertainment \u2013 origami in this case. The paper planes that landed on the pitch felt like a symbol of the fans\u2019 apathy. Jeers soon followed. \u201cBored spectators, paper planes and early exits \u2013 something is seriously wrong with this England team,\u201d was one headline. And it was even worse, as Southgate could also remember, during England\u2019s excursion to Malta the previous month when the opponents featured a centre-half from Ebbsfleet United and, for many of the travelling supporters, something snapped. The mass walkout around the 70-minute mark that night seemed like a choreographed protest. The chants of \u201cWe\u2019re fucking shit\u201d told their own story and what has never been reported until now is that England\u2019s players were also targeted as they left the ground. Malta were 190th out of 211 teams in Fifa\u2019s rankings and had won only five competitive matches in 55 years. Yet it was 0-0 at half-time and a late goal rush, when England scored three times, did not spare Southgate and his players on the journey away from the stadium. The chants informed them they were not fit to wear the shirt. It was spiteful, mutinous and the culmination, undoubtedly, of too many years of pent-up frustration. Ten months on the current side will be in Moscow on Tuesday to take on Colombia for a place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and Southgate \u2013 the man who applied for several Championship jobs without even getting an interview only a few years ago \u2013 has held himself in such a way he is doubling up, apparently, as an unexpected leader of fashion, asked in one BBC interview whether he was aware how much waistcoat sales had rocketed back in England. \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to change perceptions of how an England team might play,\u201d Southgate said of his players. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t lose sight of that. When we qualified, people were throwing paper aeroplanes on to the pitch at Wembley. We were driving back to our hotel in Malta with obscene chants being thrown at us from supporters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve started to connect the team with the public again. I feel like we\u2019ve created excitement, that we\u2019ve played in a style that has really shown what young English players are capable of, and I want us to continue doing that. I really believe in the group of players we\u2019ve got. They are young. They are inexperienced. For some of them, this will be one of the biggest games they\u2019ll have been involved in. But maybe not the biggest. We\u2019ve always got to keep that context for the players.\u201d His belief is that England cannot \u201cconsider ourselves a top team until we have beaten a top team\u201d but he is encouraging them to think like one before they get the chance to stake that claim against players such as Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and, injury permitting, James Rodr\u00edguez. Ever since the start of this tournament one phrase has been heard more than any other within the England camp. It is to \u201cattack the tournament\u201d. Don\u2019t hold back, don\u2019t play with the restraint of other England teams. Don\u2019t be the team of Euro 2016 and many others. Southgate played in an era for England when the team spirit was undermined by club cliques. Yet on Saturday, when given a day off, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jesse Lingard went together to the Divo Ostrov amusement park in St Petersburg. Or to put it another way, two players from Liverpool, two from Manchester United and one from Arsenal, all acting daft on a rollercoaster because they thought it was going to pull away before they had fixed their seatbelts. \u201cYou have to put club rivalries to one side,\u201d Lingard said. \u201cWe have been like family. We all get along with each other and that\u2019s why we have done so well. There is no squabbling. There are no cliques.\u201d Back in training on Sunday Southgate was working on his 3-3-2-2 formation and, as is now the norm, his players finished with a mock penalty shootout that involved walking from the centre circle, one by one, to take aim from 12 yards. One potential problem is that Jamie Vardy and Rashford, two players who would happily take one, may not start the match. Jordan Pickford has saved three out of 25 penalties in senior football while Jack Butland has kept out four of the 25 he has faced (but none of the last 10) and Nick Pope, England\u2019s third-choice goalkeeper, has the best statistics, with three saves out of 13. Pope is almost three inches taller than Pickford and it will be intriguing to find out whether Southgate would give any thought to bringing on the Burnley goalkeeper in those circumstances, providing England still had a substitute available. Southgate was unimpressed by Thibaut Courtois\u2019 unflattering analysis of Pickford\u2019s lack of inches after England\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Belgium last week but it is true that a goalkeeper of considerable height and arm-span can have a psychological advantage over opponents in a shootout. It is a tactic Martin O\u2019Neill employed, for instance, in the 1996 play-off final for Leicester City against Crystal Palace. It was not needed, in the end, because of Steve Claridge\u2019s last-minute winner, but O\u2019Neill had taken off Kevin Poole shortly before to replace him with Leicester\u2019s back-up goalkeeper, Zeljko Kalac, a 6ft 7in Australian who was known as \u201cSpider\u201d because of his long reach. \u201cSix foot seven and useless,\u201d as O\u2019Neill described him. There is no inside information that Southgate is planning to do the same but, for all Pickford\u2019s talents, Courtois\u2019 comments have probably stung because they carry an element of truth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
