Hundreds of millions of Chinese workers have flocked from the countryside to cities since economic reforms began three decades ago, driving the country's staggering growth. But critics say the hukou system has created second-class citizens who often struggle to gain access to basic services such as health and education. Because the hukou is inherited, migrants' children suffer the same problems. Newspapers including the Metropolis Times of Kunming, the Southern Metropolis Daily, Chongqing Times and the Economic Observer ran the appeal in a rare co-ordinated action. They timed their call to coincide with the annual meetings of China's largely rubber-stamp legislature and advisory body, which begin this week, where the hukou is likely to be high on the agenda. Officials have already pledged changes and China's premier, Wen Jiabao, promised to push ahead with them in an internet chat yesterday. But the joint editorial urged delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to hasten reforms with a view to ending the system. The hukou was introduced in the 1950s as a way of helping to manage the planned economy, but has weakened over the years. Some cities have begun allowing migrants to register as residents, giving them additional rights. Authorities fear a drastic overhaul could lead to an unmanageable influx of migrants into the main urban centres, increasing the strain on housing and services and potentially contributing to crime and unrest. The system also helps officials to keep track of individuals. Instead, the government wants to encourage rural dwellers to move to smaller cities in their own provinces. The editorial noted that the system also affects urban residents who move to other provinces \u2013 restricting their ability to get pensions and insurance \u2013 and breeds corruption, because people will pay large sums for a residence permit in cities such as Beijing. An article about the joint commentary, published on the Chinese website Sina, but credited to the Economic Observer, noted: \"This is a rare and major event in domestic media, showing [its] strong wish to participate in and promote the process of China's reform.\" It explained that the editorial was inspired by a similar project led by the Guardian, in which 56 newspapers issued a joint call for action from world leaders on climate change ahead of the Copenhagen summit in December. \"There is no doubt that what the media can do is 'advocating and urging'. The big men who hold power are the final decision-makers,\" it added. But it concluded: \"We are not just witnesses, we are participants!\" Yao Yang, deputy dean of China's National School of Development at Peking University, told the Financial Times: \"I've never heard of Chinese newspapers jointly publishing an editorial on a specific policy matter like this. It is very unusual.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
