There can be no ambassador for the bid when the ideal candidate is still preoccupied with his ambition to take part in the 2010 tournament. David Beckham is not ready to leave the stage. It was hard just to get him off the Wembley pitch after the defeat of Kazakhstan on Saturday, and he would savour another cameo against Belarus tomorrow. No critic of his attention-seeking behaviour runs short of material. Still, Beckham does show a surprising tenacity and has had to suppress some self-regard merely to cling to the national team. The midfielder, having forced himself back into England's plans after being ditched by Steve McClaren, was not in the party for Fabio Capello's opening fixture, the friendly with Switzerland eight months ago. No spirit of charity moved the Italian to include someone then stuck on 99 caps. Beckham did not persevere purely to make his 100th appearance. For a person so conscious of his image, there has been a marked humility at work. Having chosen him in the starting line-up for four consecutive matches, Capello demoted him to the substitutes' bench as soon as the qualifiers came around. The manager's decision was beyond reproach. He knew the limitations of a 33-year-old in MLS football with a moderate LA Galaxy line-up who has to commute from the west coast of America. There could be no prominence for Beckham either as soon as Capello made up his mind that the pace and skill of Theo Walcott had to be let loose on the right. The veteran's last three caps have entailed him being on the field for only 27 minutes. He has subjected himself to that in the conviction that any outing is an honour. Spectators who responded strongly to him at the weekend must believe his status lingers. Here, after all, is a one-paced footballer who cannot head the ball with conviction or tackle efficiently. But it is precisely those defects that illuminate the indefatigable trait in Beckham. He has triumphed by imbuing his crosses with such accuracy, movement and judiciousness that a series of England managers have helped him amass 106 caps. The persistence in pursuing involvement with the national team does have its note of pathos. Fulfilment might otherwise be denied him nowadays. LA Galaxy are underachievers, management is not a plausible career move, eloquent punditry will never come readily to him, and operating soccer academies is unlikely to enthral. Beckham might as well play some more football. He is not readily diverted. The soft-focus appreciation on Saturday would have been inconceivable 10 years ago. In 1998 his sending off against Argentina was a convenient pretext to denigrate him. The season opened with widespread antagonism and he was deemed superficial. By the end of the campaign he and Manchester United were Champions League winners. He never has been diverted from his objectives for long. By now he should be easier to discard, but alternatives to him looked obvious in days gone by as well. McClaren snubbed him in 2006 when ruling that Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson and Aaron Lennon all had a better case to be in the squad for a game against Greece. Now, Lennon and Richardson are out of the running and Wright-Phillips, like Beckham, is merely a substitute. David Bentley, much less exact though he is with his crosses, bears a rough resemblance to the old-timer and may dislodge him on grounds of age alone if his form at Tottenham improves. By the next World Cup, Beckham will be 35. When Capello overlooked him for that match with Switzerland it was because the veteran was out of shape, with LA Galaxy in their pre-season phase. The circumstances will be repeated when England play their expected friendly with Spain in February. It would be hard for Beckham, a year on, to reinstate himself once more. Nonetheless, his refusal to yield highlights the flinty character that has always existed beneath the frippery and fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
