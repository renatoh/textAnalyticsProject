The manufacturers claim that as a person lathers him or herself with the Shower Shock soap it releases caffeine that is absorbed into the user's system and provides the same hit as a couple of cups of coffee. Happily the soap is also infused with peppermint and citrus scents so you don't end up smelling like a jar of coffee beans . A shower gel is also on offer, although the makers, Think Geek, warn that neither is recommended for pregnant women or children because of the caffeine content. Jennifer Kuropkat, of Think Geek, said both products were aimed at people who just did not have time to get the coffee on and get washed. In America, where it was invented, it is being sold under the advertising strapline: \"Have smelly co-workers that sleep in too much? Give them the gift of Shower Shock.\" Ms Kuropkat said: \"We love caffeinated products and our designers came up with the idea to combine it with a soap. Every full body wash with the Shower Shock soap will provide the equivalent of around two cups worth of coffee. \"The caffeine is absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. It has exactly the same effect as if you were drinking coffee. Your blood pressure and pulse rate will increase, making your brain feel more alert and awake. \"The caffeine will then last in your system for approximately four hours - the same as two cups of coffee. They really are time-saves as you don't have to wait around for your coffee to brew in the morning.\" The 4oz bars of soap, available via the internet, cost \u00a33.50, and there is also a smaller travel version. The Mountain Dew shower gel costs \u00a36.50."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
