Three weeks on, the singing has stopped and social unrest is mounting as a significant part of the population, especially in the poorer south, realise that everything is not all right. \u201cThey are no longer singing or dancing on the balconies,\u201d said Salvatore Melluso, a priest at Caritas Diocesana di Napoli, a church-run charity in Naples. \u201cNow people are more afraid \u2013 not so much of the virus, but of poverty. Many are out of work and hungry. There are now long queues at food banks.\u201d There have been far fewer coronavirus deaths in Italy\u2019s south compared with the worst-affected northern regions, but the pandemic is having a serious impact on livelihoods. Tensions are building across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia as people run out of food and money. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. The self-employed or those working on contracts that do not guarantee social benefits have lost salaries, and many small businesses may never reopen. Paride Ezzine, a waiter in Palermo, Sicily, no longer gets his salary. \u201cObviously, due to the lockdown, the restaurant closed,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a wife and two children and we\u2019re living off our savings. But I don\u2019t know how long they will last. I asked my bank to postpone payment instalments \u2013 they said no. This situation is bringing us to our knees.\u201d The ramifications of the lockdown, which is poised to be extended until at least Easter, are also affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who were working off the books, of whom more than 1 million live across Campania, Sicily, Puglia and Calabria, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. \u201cIn reality, we don\u2019t know how many are working in the black as these numbers are only estimates,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. \u201cHowever, a significant number of people live day to day, doing occasional jobs. There are also many shopkeepers, or professionals working for themselves, who may have moderate reserves that will run out the longer they\u2019re in lockdown.\u201d Amid the brewing social unrest, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.8bn) from a solidarity fund would immediately be advanced to all municipalities and an additional \u20ac400m would go to mayors for conversion into food stamps. But mayors have protested that the funds, especially the \u20ac400m for food vouchers, are insufficient. \u201cIt is absolutely not enough,\u201d said Salvo Pogliese, the mayor of Catania. \u201cWe were expecting more and I hope the government will find a way. The situation is extremely delicate as a significant part of the population has zero income. Those who before lived with dignity, now find themselves in difficulty.\u201d One of the issues is that the \u20ac4.3bn was due to be given to mayors in May, and much of the funding had already been designated to be spent in other areas. \u201cIf the government expects this money to be used to feed people, then municipalities won\u2019t have money for other things,\u201d said Orsina. \u201cAnd the new tranche of \u20ac400m, if you divide it up between all municipalities, is peanuts. The problem has been offloaded to mayors \u2013 Italians will now go asking them for money that they can\u2019t give. Expectations have been created that can\u2019t be satisfied.\u201d There are also signs that criminal organisations are exploiting the situation. Investigations are under way into the activities of a Facebook group called \u201cNational Revolution\u201d that has been inciting people to loot supermarkets. \u201cThe people [behind this group] are those who, before the lockdown, made a living from house robberies and shop thefts,\u201d said a source from the Sicily unit of Digos, Italy\u2019s anti-terrorism police squad. \u201cBut with some of these criminal activities being on standby due to the lockdown, the only shops open to rob are supermarkets and chemists. These are people who, due to rampant poverty in the south, usually survive from criminal activities, but who are now not doing so well.\u201d Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, has asked the government to establish a \u201csurvival income\u201d for the poorest citizens owing to fears that \u201ccriminal groups could promote violence acts\u201d. Officials also worry that the mafia will take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation. \u201cCriminal organisations have plenty of money and people could end up working for them, and once that starts, they won\u2019t go back,\u201d said Orsina. Meanwhile, taxes for small businesses have merely been suspended, not abolished, meaning owners will still have to find money for contributions at a later stage, despite losing income during the lockdown. And those who can tap into financial support are coming up against stifling bureaucracy. \u201cBureaucracy is the real enemy of this country and in a crisis situation it\u2019s impossible to solve this problem,\u201d said Massimiliano Panarari, a professor at Luiss University. \u201cPeople may have tried to keep their spirits up at the beginning of the lockdown, but now their thoughts are returning towards the bitter reality of a terribly fragile country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
