This last example may well be the least likely, but consider this: Charlton Athletic has invested \u00a3130,000 in offering supporters a trip to Middlesbrough this week to watch their team attempt to reach the FA Cup semi-finals. No doubt around the boardrooms of the Premiership, the cynics will be dismissing the club's unprecedented gesture: \"Pure indulgence. They didn't need to spend that - the fans won't remember it if they lose . . . \" That is exactly the kind of attitude that is threatening the very lifeblood of the Premiership - the flow of television monies. It used to be that crowd trouble involved the ripping up of seats - today the trouble is that too many of those seats are unoccupied. So many more live TV games these days feature acres of empty rows - and nobody seems to be worried. Only Charlton Athletic, it seems, are willing to act. Clubs who can't fill their grounds seem content to rely on the traditional, one-way contract with their fans that dictates: fans give, clubs take. That is a relationship that cannot be sustained without serious financial consequences. Charlton's investment in helping to fill out the Riverside Stadium tomorrow night is the first high-profile move to address the problem of the missing fans - other clubs will have to follow. If they do not, the Premiership's mutual love affair with their TV paymasters will be severely tested as more and more Premiership games are played in front of more and more vacant seats. Television sport abhors the vacuum of an empty, echoing stadium. One reason why so many sports have failed to attract major TV exposure is the lack of atmosphere caused by half-filled venues. At Charlton we are particularly sensitive to empty seats, and for good reason. Given where the club has come from in its recent past - somewhere south of oblivion - we have the \"advantage\" of a near-death understanding of the need to invest in the future. The Middlesbrough cash injection did not come out of the blue. It springs from the club's increasing recognition that investing in the club's future is the only way to avoid the blight of empty seats, build a fan base for the future and keep TV happy. The money mood in football clubs these days is for ever-rising ticket prices and the short-term commercial imperative is to pick the fans' pockets at every turn. Next season to make The Valley as affordable as possible, season-ticket prices have actually been reduced and there will be new \u00a399 season tickets for under 11s. After drawing the home tie with Boro three weeks ago, our chief executive Peter Varney suggested investing half of the live TV replay fee in free and subsidised transport for fans. The board readily agreed. To be fair, Charlton Athletic has not had a sniff of a cup semi-final since winning the FA Cup at Wembley in 1947 and the board took the decision against the background of an annual budget that was based on a third-round exit. We may be misty-eyed about our supporters, but not about our cup prospects. Thirty-two thousand letters went out to the fan data base under the banner Operation Riverside. And so, today 5,250 of the Charlton faithful, myself included, will make the journey to Middlesbrough in three chartered planes from Gatwick (at a heavily subsidised \u00a350 return), plus two special trains and 52 coaches - paid for by the club. The numbers travelling are limited only by the ticket allocation.
