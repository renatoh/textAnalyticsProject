The 13-book series follows orphaned siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire as they stumble through a world of mystery and misfortune. Netflix acquired the rights and the show will be produced in association with Paramount Television, which made the 2004 film adaptation. Snicket, the pen name of American writer Daniel Handler, will be an executive producer. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Snicket said. \u201cAfter years of providing top-quality entertainment on demand, Netflix is risking its reputation and its success by associating itself with my dismaying and upsetting books.\u201d The beloved series was published from 1999 to 2006 and more than 60m copies of the books have sold worldwide. The 2004 film starring Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep took in $200m. \u201cOn the search for fantastic material that appeals to both parents and kids, the first stop for generations of readers is A Series of Unfortunate Events. We are proud to start work on a series for a global audience that already loves the books,\u201d Cindy Holland, vice-president of original content for Netflix, said in a statement. \u201cThe world created by Lemony Snicket is unique, darkly funny and relatable. We can\u2019t wait to bring it to life for Netflix members.\u201d This is the latest in Netflix\u2019s original programming conquests, which have included dozens of projects including original series like the Emmy-award winning Orange is the New Black, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos spoke about the streaming service\u2019s approach to movies during the US/China Film Summit on Wednesday. \u201cWe need to stop distinguishing the experience by access,\u201d he said. \u201cMany movies are just as good, if not better, at home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
