This was a nobler, simpler age when the number of designers working did not outnumber the people able to buy its wares and Topshop did not need to restock their rails every 45 minutes in order to appease customers' attention deficit disorder. A simpler age, yes, but a darker one. Now, the fashion seasons are not defined by just one look, but at least 72. Although this is obviously brilliant in terms of looking at how model Agyness Deyn wears them all together at the same time, it does throw up a quandary: which trend will you make your defining look of the season? Fret no more, gentle if anxious readers, because we have sorted chaff from wheat and boiled the essential 72 trends for autumn/winter down to four crucial ones. This quiz will determine definitively which one is for you. For next season, anyway. 1. Your idea of a good night out is: (a) Sitting in a field with Leah Wood, strumming a guitar and wishing you'd lived through the 70s. (b) Going somewhere very dark, very loud and very angry. (c) Rocking up at the latest new club night and being a bit \"wacky\". (d) Anywhere incredibly expensive. 2. The most frequently played bands or singers on your iPod are: (a) Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Syd Barrett. (b) The Cure, Wagner, My Chemical Romance. (c) The Klaxons, CSS, MGMT. (d) Tchaikovsky, Arcade Fire, Sean Lennon. 3. You think having a sense of humour is: (a) What? You didn't hear the question, you were too busy humming Chelsea Morning. (b) A sign of a shallow mind that has fallen for the capitalist conspiracy and is blind to one's own mortality. (c) Hilarious! Whee! (d) Something one grows out of, thank God. 4. What keeps you awake at night? (a) Worrying about world peace and whether paisley works with florals. (b) You're not dictated to by the movement of the sun. You sleep all day and think very, very deep thoughts all night. (c) Your own effervescent bubbliness. (d) The bruise on your chest caused by your enormous necklace. 5. Every year, you go to: (a) Marrakech, or maybe your family's 1,000 acre farm in Somerset. (b) Eastern Europe, the cradle of nihilism. (c) An amazing music festival abroad. (d) Skiing in Klosters or Gstaad, whichever costs more this year. 6. One thing you never leave the house without is: (a) Your guitar - you never know when people might fancy a sing-song. (b) A sense of your own mortality. (c) Hot-pink worn somewhere on your person. (d) One item that costs at least \u00a380,000. 7. Your feelings about fur are: (a) Obviously, killing anything is awful. Ooh, but your vintage fur gilet goes so well with your orange kaftan. (b) Whatever. We all die in the end anyway. (c) Amazing! Especially if you dye it blue! (d) Only proles wear fur. You only wear astrakhan, the pelt taken from fetal lambs. 8. Your favourite artist is: (a) Peter Max. (b) Edvard Munch. (c) Andy Warhol. (d) Gustav Klimt. 9. True love is: (a) Something that happens to you every day. You love the sky, the sea, the trees, him, him - oh, and him. (b) A false emotion coined by the greetings card industry and a reflection of our collective fear of being alone. (c) A lot like that feeling you had at 6am on Saturday after you swallowed that pink pill. (d) A Faberg\u00e9 egg. 10. Who would play you in a film? (a) Ali McGraw. (b) A young Winona Ryder. (c) Meg Ryan for perkiness, Zandra Rhodes for the wardrobe. (d) Kristin Scott Thomas. Next season, you will be wearing ... Mostly A: Folk/hippy You love acoustic music and your hair is long, flowing and, ideally, blond. You care passionately about world peace, almost as much as you care about getting invited to Alice Temperley's villa in Ibiza this summer. Whatever, you shall be wearing paisley dresses - either girly-twirly short or dramatic and long - bright colours with an emphasis on orange, trailing scarves and, of course, the crucial detail: a centre parting. Mostly B: Intellectual goth Life is pain. And very, very black. You read Nietzsche for fun and you think laughing is for wimps. Not, of course, that such depth means you are averse to spending a couple of grand on a black lace Prada dress or a long black Viktor &amp; Rolf skirt. Black lipstick, black hair and black eyeliner are essential, as is lots of Morticia Addams-style lace. You aspire to solemnity but, late at night, you secretly suspect you dress like Mrs Danvers. Mostly C: Tartan Pay attention to me! Pay attention to me! The tartan wearer is the centre of every party (and photo) - because she makes it that way. The more tartan, the merrier; and the brighter the colours and the bigger the checks, the better. She is at the cutting edge of London's music scene, but there is one band she has not heard of: any jokes about the Bay City Rollers will go right over her brightly dyed head. Mostly D: Statement jewellery Forget about clothes - all you have to do is to wear one piece of really enormous, really expensive jewellery, preferably slung ever so casually over your plush cashmere coat or astrakhan full-length cloak. You may set off alarms at the airport, but you advise flying VIP first-class - it makes life so much easier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
