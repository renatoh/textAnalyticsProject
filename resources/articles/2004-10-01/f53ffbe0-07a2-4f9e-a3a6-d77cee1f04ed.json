Jelena had shown that she's a great player. She was in crisis. The time has come to correct that.\" Dokic and her father have been estranged for much of the last two years, ever since a public row with him and her mother Liliana during an event in Filderstadt in October 2002, which led to both parents being refused credentials for tournaments where she was playing. Her father's outbursts at tournaments, including Wimbledon and the US Open, lead to the WTA banning him from the circuit for six months, yet his daughter stood by him. Since splitting from her father, Dokic has tried working with a string of other coaches while her ranking has sunk from a career high of No4 in the world to No105. With her father's help she won five singles titles and was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon, results which contrast sharply with this season's efforts. She has not won a match since April and suffered eight first-round defeats in a row. Dokic could not be reached for comment last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
