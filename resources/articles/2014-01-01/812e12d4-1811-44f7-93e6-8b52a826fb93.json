The feeling in Norway, in particular among those close to Solskjaer, was that the 40-year-old would politely decline Cardiff City's interest on the basis that Sir Alex Ferguson has always preached the importance of choosing an owner rather than a club. Either Solskjaer does not hang on his former Manchester United manager's every word as some suspected, or he views Vincent Tan in a different light to the rest of the football world. Courtesy of Tan's private jet, Solskjaer sat alongside the Cardiff owner in the director's box at the Emirates Stadium yesterday, when he watched the team he is expected to take over succumb to a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal that leaves them only one point and one place above the relegation zone. He has not been confirmed as Malky Mackay's successor just yet but all the indications are that an agreement is extremely close. Whatever has been written and said about Tan \u2013 and the vast majority has not been particularly complimentary \u2013 the Malaysian businessman, aided by the help of the Cardiff chairman, Mehmet Dalman, has pulled off quite a coup by convincing the Molde manager to seriously entertain thoughts of replacing Mackay. Solskjaer, after all, has been courted by several Premier League clubs over the last couple of years. And he certainly does not need to do the job at Cardiff for the money. What Solskjaer will need millions of pounds for if he takes over is to strengthen the Cardiff team \u2013 something that Tan has promised to back the new manager with over the next four weeks. The word is that Cardiff, who splurged more than \u00a330m in the summer, will be among the biggest spenders this month, with Tan open to the possibility of bringing in more players in the same bracket as Steven Caulker. How easy it would be for Solskjaer to spend that money on the right players remains to be seen. Cardiff had the financial wherewithal, both in terms of fees and wages, to compete for big-name players in the summer, but they found it extremely hard to convince their targets to join a newly-promoted club that had never been in the Premier League before. Solskjaer, by virtue of his name and his status in the game, may well have more pulling power than Mackay when it comes to the hard sell but what he cannot promise is top-flight football next season, even if Tan is hell-bent on making sure that Cardiff survive. Arguably what Solskjaer could do with on the pitch more than anything is a modern-day version of himself. Cardiff have badly struggled for goals this season \u2013 only Crystal Palace have scored fewer than the 15 the Welsh club have managed in 20 Premier League games. Great entertainers they are not. Pragmatism ruled the day under Mackay, which was why some fans had started to become frustrated with what they were seeing on the pitch, even if the Scot remained hugely popular among the majority of supporters. Solskjaer will be going down a more expansive tactical path if he signs on the dotted line. In an interview with the Norwegian magazine Josimar in 2012, Solskjaer revealed that he had modelled his coaching at Molde \"a bit on the United way of playing. So it's a kind of 4-4-2, but with a striker up front and one player who drops behind the striker. A winger that runs up and down all the time, which Giggsy did, and one that goes a little bit more in and out, as Becks did.\" He also talked about \"a lot of position-swapping in the middle\". Before Cardiff fans start to get excited, it is worth bearing in mind that Solskjaer made those comments in 2012, when he was in his second season at Molde, after winning the title in his first campaign. It would, in other words, be naive to think that he would try and turn Cardiff into \"a mini Manchester United\" \u2013 which is how Solskjaer described Molde \u2013 mid-season and when they are scrapping for their lives at the foot of one of the most competitive leagues in the world. Get through this season, however, and Solskjaer may well view Cardiff as a club that can establish itself in the Premier League if \u2013 and it's a big if \u2013 he can work under Tan, a man about whom one suspects the Norwegian will have learned as much during the game at Arsenal as the players he could soon be managing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
