That could clear the way for the former Great Britain full-back to make a surprise return to Wigan, who were themselves forced to release him to Leeds last season because of salary-cap restraints. Connolly has not been selected by the Rhinos coach Tony Smith since their Challenge Cup defeat at St Helens on March 13, losing his place to Richie Mathers, who at 20 is almost 13 years his junior. Wigan have given themselves room to manoeuvre under the salary cap by allowing Luke Robinson to join Castleford on loan and also removing Brian Carney from their senior squad while the Irishman recovers from his broken ankle. Hull are hoping for a 20,000 crowd as they aim to cut the Rhinos' lead at the top of the Super League table to two points following their impressive recent wins at Bradford and Huddersfield, although they have suffered a blow with the former Leeds prop Gareth Carvell ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. Carvell is replaced by Paul King tonight while Leeds make two changes to the team who beat Warrington in their last game two weeks ago, with Chris Feather and Wayne McDonald replacing the injured forwards Danny Ward and Willie Poching. Stuart Spruce, another former Great Britain full-back, who retired during the winter, has been appointed Neil Kelly's assistant coach at Widnes following the departure of John Myler. The Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington has denied that the All Black centre Tana Umaga is on the way to Headingley on a cross-code contract. \"We are talking to a New Zealander but it's not him,\" Hetherington said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
