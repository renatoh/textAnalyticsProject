Scotland\u2019s first minister told an audience in Dublin that \u201cwe should be open-minded about solutions that can help, whether it is Scotland or individuals, who want to retain their citizenship, their relationship with the EU\u201d. Sturgeon was reacting to questions from students at Trinity College Dublin about the notion of \u201cassociate citizenship\u201d \u2013 which has been backed by Guy Verhofstadt, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. In her speech to the university\u2019s Philosophical Society, Sturgeon said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be ruling out anything just now. People say to me \u2013 as I\u2019m sure they are saying to [Verhofstadt] about that particular proposal \u2013 that is impossible, that could never work. Well, how do we know that? \u201cWe are going into a period that is completely uncharted, in terms of what happens now.\u201d She added: \u201dWe are going to have to be imaginative, innovative and creative in the period ahead, if we are going to come out of this Brexit scenario in good shape, without damaging the things that we value in the UK. So let us be open-minded about some of the suggestions.\u201d Verhofstadt said he was attracted to the idea \u201cthat people who are European citizens and saying they want to keep it have the possibility of doing so\u201d. Sturgeon repeated her view that a second Scottish independence referendum is highly likely after the Brexit vote. She stressed that the Scottish government would be exploring all alternative options to Scotland being pushed off a \u201chard Brexit cliff edge\u201d. She admitted that a section of the electorate who vote for the Scottish National party voted for Brexit in the June referendum and also accepted that there were many things wrong with the EU that had to be reformed. On Brexit being an opportunity for the SNP\u2019s ultimate goal of independence, she said: \u201cI have always believed Scotland will become an independent country and I think it will become an independent country well within my lifetime \u2013 and this may be the moment for that.\u201d Her speech in Trinity, where she accepted an honorary patronage from the Philosophical Society, was part of a two-day tour of Dublin. On Tuesday she will be a guest of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, when she will argue for new, stronger links between businesses in Scotland and Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
