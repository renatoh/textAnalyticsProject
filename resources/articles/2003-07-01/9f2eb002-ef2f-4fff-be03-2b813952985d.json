While householders can nowadays draw upon an increasingly sophisticated array of hi-tech weaponry to keep their home safe, from CCTV to sensor-triggered lighting and alarms that use your mobile phone to call the police, crime reduction schemes nationwide are also focusing on the simpler steps you can take. In Derby, police are working with a local garden centre to promote a range of prickly plants that can be placed at strategic points in your garden. As well as providing a barrier to keep intruders out, the police claim brambles and other shrubs with sharp thorns can be used to help gather DNA evidence. Detective Inspector Karl Barrow told a local newspaper: 'Burglars hate brambles. While they may avoid leaving fingerprints, it is far more difficult to avoid leaving DNA. A spot of blood the size of a pinprick is more than enough.' In Derby there were more than 3,600 burglaries in 2002, and 77 people were arrested on the strength of DNA left at the scene of the crime - though it is not clear how much of this was the result of garden bushes. Making your home more secure might not increase its value, but it could well affect its saleability, according to estate agent Jeremy Leaf, a spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'The perception of crime is often as important as the actual figures,' says Leaf, 'but if you live on a new development and everyone else has burglar alarms but you don't, then you would certainly feel more vulnerable.' Nevertheless, he says, few vendors will give having been burgled as a reason for selling, and installing too much in the way of obvious security measures can simply draw attention to the fact that you have a problem. At Wyevale Garden Centres, spokeswoman Ruth Parry says: 'A well-maintained boundary hedge will add to the character of your property, but will also enhance garden security. Hedges not only deter entry to a garden, but a dense hedge will also contain children and most pets.' She recommends berberis, which can grow to a height of 1.5 metres, and whose sharp little thorns are not immediately visible, but could give somebody trying to reach a window a nasty shock. Other plants commonly chosen for their natural 'razorwire' properties include pyracantha, holly, hawthorn and rambling roses. Gloucestershire police have been using leaflets to promote defensive planting. Paul Francis, the force's crime reduction officer, says sharp vegetation can also capture fibres of clothing that can provide forensic evidence. He adds: 'We don't want people to develop a fortress mentality because that increases the fear of crime. But by growing some of these plants, maybe along a trellis along the top of your fence, you can soften the lines at the same time as protecting yourself.' Gloucestershire's website suggests that water can also be used in your garden as a security measure. You could install a pond beneath a window that is vulnerable; if you are more ambitious than that, and your garden is big enough, why not go for an old-fashioned moat? Gravel is also a favourite as an early warning system. Those crunching footsteps in the middle of the night will have you sitting up in bed in a shot. But as John Goode, a former policeman who is now a home security consultant for insurer Hiscox Direct, points out: 'You can't really count upon that unless you are always a light sleeper. And if you do hear someone coming down your drive, what are you going to do about it?' He believes that 'softer' security measures should be backed up by more conventional tools such as locks, alarms and exterior lighting. Goode says: 'You should develop a strategy for protecting your house: do your own survey, starting off inside the house, then walking around outside, and finally walking around the perimeter, looking for weaknesses. It's a bit like peeling an onion, in which the perimeter is the outer layer.' A general rule is that boundaries which are not overlooked should be high and impenetrable, while those which are overlooked - usually the front garden - should have a low wall or hedge so an intruder can be seen. Some crime reduction bodies recommend ensuring that there is only one entrance and exit to your property, as burglars don't like to be cornered, but Goode says you should avoid any physical confrontation with a burglar, in which you might well end up on the losing side. The thing burglars hate most of all, he says, is a house that is occupied, so among the most effective steps you can take are to leave no clues, such as milk or newspaper deliveries, that you are away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
