A modest but significant 12% said they were more likely to vote Tory if Mr Clarke were given the job. The findings may reflect the fact that as a former cabinet minister, Mr Clarke is better known than the other candidates. Only 10% backed David Davis, but 33% said they had no preference between any of the candidates. The BBC poll is the first since Mr Clarke announced his candidacy last week with a strong defence of his decision to oppose the war in Iraq. Mr Clarke believes his early emphasis on Iraq provides a lever to neutralise the Liberal Democrat threat, underline his own sound judgment and dilute his foreign policy brand as an obsessive pro-European. The poll findings may present a dilemma for the Conservative rank and file, who in a 2001 membership ballot rejected the pro-European Mr Clarke. The outgoing Tory leader, Michael Howard, is battling to win sufficient support for his plan to return the right to elect the leader solely to MPs. A ballot currently under way of party activists needs a two-thirds majority for the rule change to be agreed. The result is due on September 27, and may see the changes rejected. The Tories as a result may not have a leader until 2006. Mr Davis predicted yesterday that Mr Howard's plan would be defeated by activists. He also announced that he supports the decision on the leadership being taken first by the membership, followed by a later, separate vote by MPs. Mr Davis told the BBC: \"I think the new proposal to do away with the rights of the membership is likely to be turned down - I don't think that's a bad thing. \"I think it would have been much easier just to say to the party in the country: 'Why don't we reverse the order -you have the first hit and MPs have the last say.' That way, we could have avoided the issue of having somebody elected without majority support in the House of Commons.\" Mr Davis, a Eurosceptic and advocate of lower taxes, is more likely to win if the membership is closely involved in the leadership election. By contrast, it is widely thought that Mr Clarke's best chance of winning the leadership at the third attempt lies in MPs being given back the sole right to elect their leader. Mr Clarke denies this and will be helped by the BBC poll in trying to convince the party that his age, politics and style will not be barriers with the electorate. The poll, conducted for the BBC by ICM, showed 40% favour Mr Clarke, with Mr Davis polling 10%, David Cameron and Malcolm Rifkind 4% each, Liam Fox 3% and David Willetts 2%. Andrew Tyrie, a prominent supporter of Mr Clarke, said: \"The poll shows that even before Mr Clarke had become leader, he has the support in the country to win power back for the Conservatives. A swing of 12% would be enough to win the marginal constituencies we need for a majority.\" A poll conducted by Populus for The Times showed 41% backed Mr Clarke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
