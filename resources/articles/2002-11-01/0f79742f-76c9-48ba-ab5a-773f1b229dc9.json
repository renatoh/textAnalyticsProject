He is due to make an announcement tomorrow. If Bosnich opts for the latter option, Chelsea will almost certainly terminate his \u00a350,000-a-week contract which runs until the summer of 2004. He would be suspended during any rehabilitation programme. The advantage of that for the 30-year-old Australian is that he would be able to resume his career with another club once it was proved he is clean, and he would not have to serve a worldwide ban of up to two years. If that were the case, Bosnich would attend a specialist clinic such as the Priory and be given counselling. The alternative course of action would, on the face of it, seem unlikely to result in the Australian clearing his name. Proving one's innocence as a sportsperson is extremely difficult, as athletes such as Diane Modahl and Dougie Walker discovered. Modahl took her case to the House of Lords and lost. However, the route may still appeal to Bosnich and his advisers. They may feel there is a chance of clearing him and, in any event, it could have considerable financial benefits as the case could take a year or more to settle. \"It's not easy to challenge drug tests,\" said Nick Bitel, a sports lawyer. \"But, if he does and he is suspended from play but not banned, he would not have been found guilty of anything and it would be unreasonable not to pay him.\" Paul Edwards, the English shot-putter who failed a drug test at the Commonwealth Games in 1994, is still taking legal action over his case now. Modahl's started in 1994 and was concluded only last year. Under those circumstances Bosnich would receive the full worth of his \u00a32.4m-a-year contract until any guilt were established, far more than he could expect to earn elsewhere after any rehabilitation or would expect to pay in legal fees. No date has been set for analysis of Bosnich's B test although only one case in the past 15 years has failed to follow the A test. Mohamed Al Fayed, meanwhile, has turned down an offer to buy into Chelsea and share their ground. The Fulham chairman was approached by his Chelsea counterpart Ken Bates and asked whether he wanted to buy a 9.9% stake in Chelsea Village plc - the highest proportion possible under Premier League rules - and share the ground. The \u00a315m scheme would have included Fulham taking out a 25-year lease at Stamford Bridge, where they would have their own changing area, boardroom and commercial facilities. \"The chairman wrote to Bates declining the offer,\" a Fulham spokesperson said. \"He is publicly committed to redeveloping Craven Cottage or at least building a modern stadium in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.\" However, it is understood that Al Fayed would consider a temporary groundshare if the plans stall because of planning difficulties. Fulham will play at QPR until the end of next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
