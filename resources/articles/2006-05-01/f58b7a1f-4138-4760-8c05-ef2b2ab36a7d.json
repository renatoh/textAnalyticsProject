Who were the key players? The ECB's chief executive, David Collier, and commercial director John Perera and NatWest's marketing director, Helen Page. What's it worth? The new deal is worth close to \u00a310m, and NatWest, a loyal ECB partner, has invested \"more than \u00a335m into cricket over the last 25 years\". What swung it? That history of investment. \"NatWest is proud to support innovation within the game and we look forward to NatWest Pro40 adding a new dimension to our existing cricket sponsorship,\" said Page. The ECB now presides over the NatWest Series one-day internationals and NatWest Twenty20 internationals in the men's and women's games. The bank also supports NatWest Cricket Force, NatWest InterCricket and the National Volunteer Recognition Programme. Who's happier? Both sides have something to boast about, but the ECB will be especially glad to have secured a replacement for the 45-over Totesport League. Who's miffed? Cricket fans without access to satellite TV. The new tournament will be broadcast live by Sky - like the rest of the English summer schedule. What happens now? Essex Eagles, the last winners of the 45-over Totesport League, prepare to open the new competition under lights at Chelmsford, against the Northamptonshire Steelbacks on July 18. A promotion play-off ends the season on September 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
