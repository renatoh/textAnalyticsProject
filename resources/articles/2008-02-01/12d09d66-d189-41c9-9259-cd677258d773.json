Trailing 2-0 after day one, Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were given the task of keeping the visitors' slim hopes alive against David Nalbandian and Jose Acasuso. The British pair had set points in the second set but squandered them, and with those went their hopes as Nalbandian and Acasuso raced to a 6-2, 7-6 (13-11), 6-0 victory. Doubles specialists Murray and Hutchins struggled to get into the match in the opening set and were clearly second best. The Argentinians took an early lead in the second set but Britain broke back in the eighth game and held on to force a tie-break. The breaker followed the pattern of the set with Nalbandian and Acasuso moving to 6-4 only for Murray and Hutchins to level. The British pair created three set points of their own but could not take them and the hosts clinched the set 13-11 when Hutchins fluffed a volley. Argentina pressed home their advantage by breaking Hutchins in the second game of the third set and, after a 40-minute rain delay, quickly wrapped up the win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
