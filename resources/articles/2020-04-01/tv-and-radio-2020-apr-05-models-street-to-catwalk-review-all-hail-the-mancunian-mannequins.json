I\u2019m 17. Apparently, girls love me.\u201d Ethan stares dead-eyed at the camera, daring us to contradict him. Love that \u201capparently\u201d. Mind you, I would like to hear the girls\u2019 side of the story. But there is a more pressing problem. If Ethan, a willowy Mancunian with frizzy ginger hair, matching freckles and an unexpectedly beguiling smile, is going to break into the modelling business, he will have to have a word with himself. \u201cWe can\u2019t represent anybody that\u2019s involved in criminality,\u201d says Nigel, the head of a model agency that calls itself, presumably ironically, Nemesis. Ethan has a rap sheet as long as the East Lancs Road. Bored, he lists his crimes: \u201cPossession of class A drugs with intent to supply, possession of class B drugs with intent to supply, possession of a bladed article in a public place, two robberies, perverting the course of justice, two affrays \u2026\u201d Hold on, Ethan, mate. \u201cBladed article\u201d? Isn\u2019t the word \u201cknife\u201d? Model: From Street to Catwalk (BBC Three) profiles two buff young Manc geezers trying to escape their humble lives to become paid clothes hangers for athleisurewear. While Ethan is trying to escape a life of crime, Jordan is hoping to get out of his life of grime. His nine-to-five as a labourer involved shovelling rubble and gutting soon-to-be gentrified properties that the likes of him would never be able affordon their current wages. Jordan shows his mother pictures that Nemesis\u2019s photographers have taken of him to establish his credentials for potential clients. \u201cManchester look, chavvy, know what I mean?\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can be called worse things, can\u2019t ya?\u201d she tells him as she scrolls. Jordan was scouted one night while walking around town. \u201cHe typifies everything we\u2019re looking for right now,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe want you to look like that, to be a lad, a scally, but we actually want you to be professional about it.\u201d Jordan\u2019s problem is that, in trial photo shoots, he didn\u2019t project himself with the verve he had displayed in his natural habitat. \u201cHe\u2019s a Manchester lad. He\u2019s got that gritty northern look, if you like.\u201d Ethan and Jordan are the success stories, the pair who are selected from a waiting room of 20 possibles. Some of the 18 rejects, though, were more handsome. But that is not the point. What Nemesis wants is not looks. It is a look. An attitude. If you are to be persuaded to purchase trackie bottoms and a no-less-flammable top, you won\u2019t want to buy them just because the model is gorgeous. You will want to buy into the lifestyle inscribed on the model\u2019s body and clobber. You must be made to believe that their badass strut, thousand-yard stare and ostensibly antinomian persona can be yours for the price of a hoodie. The day before Jordan\u2019s first assignment, his mum texts him: \u201cBed at 9pm for you gotta look after that face get your bum hole waxed.\u201d Some mothers hope their sons will be doctors, others that they will be cosmetically enhanced where the sun don\u2019t shine. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be getting many shots of my bum hole, Mum.\u201d Well, probably not for his first client, JD Sports. But you never know, Jordan, what future clients may require. Best be, like the Scouts, prepared. I would have liked more on what it is like to be a man and to be objectified by photographers for a living, but neither Ethan nor Jordan reflect on that aspect of their chosen profession. But both nail what it means to them. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit easier staying still taking pictures than robbing people and selling their stuff \u2013 and at least it\u2019s legit,\u201d says Ethan. Jordan\u2019s first day as a model pays more than a week\u2019s labouring. Like boxing or football for previous Ethans and Jordans of this world, modelling could be an escape from the streets. Fingers crossed they will emulate another success story, 23-year-old Ruby, who has been modelling for less than a year and already earns more than \u00a310,000 a month. If she cracks the US, she could triple that. \u201cShe\u2019s got the badass look,\u201d explains a Nemesis functionary. \u201cWe know she will sell for us.\u201d We see her shooting in a Welsh quarry, the grey slate rhyming with her tough-girl check strides and black quilted puffer jacket. If I wanted to look like a badass young woman, I would definitely buy what Ruby is modelling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
