Flanked by Sarah Teather, the Lib Dems' local government spokeswoman, Nick Clegg, Vince Cable and Baroness Shirley Williams, Sir Menzies said he wanted to lead a \"strong, distinguished\" party that would be \"serious about politics\". \"Under my leadership the Lib Dems will not be making lighthearted objections from the sidelines,\" Sir Menzies said. He also promised to draw on the talents of younger MPs \"This bright generation has chosen the Lib Dems,\" he said. \"It is my job to harness their ability.\" Setting out five key themes for his leadership - the \"war on poverty\", protecting civil liberties, a \"strong House of Commons\" and elected Lords, the environment and internationalism - Sir Menzies said he wanted to \"reduce the power of an over-mighty state\" and promote localism. He will publish a full manifesto next week. Sir Menzies' wife joined him on the stage after his speech, to loud applause from Liberal Democrat supporters, and he kissed her forehead and exchanged a few words. Baroness Williams earlier endorsed 64-year-old Sir Menzies' leadership bid, describing him as \" a man for whom the word 'spin' has something to do with a washing machine and nothing to do with politics.\" Nick Clegg told Sir Menzies' supporters that \"no leader, however good, can lead entirely on their own\" and that \"great leaders acted as a catalyst for those around them\". \"We should also judge Ming by the great, great team he has assembled,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
