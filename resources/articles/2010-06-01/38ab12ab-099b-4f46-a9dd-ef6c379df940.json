Brazil turned on the style against Ivory Coast as they made it through to the knock-out stages, but current World Champions Italy were made to look very sheepish indeed by New Zealand. Our Kiwi of choice Colin Peacock gives his reaction, and we also give some love to Paraguay, who got the better of Slovakia. Also in the podcast, we discuss the unhappy campers in France and England and wonder why so many teams are imploding. Similarly, we ponder why it's the South American teams who are leading the way in the competition so far. Finally, we hear from Sid Lowe ahead of Spain's game with Honduras. Can the favourites bounce back from their opening game defeat to Switzerland? Tweet us during the day, and we'll see you tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
