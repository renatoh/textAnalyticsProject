In the first scheme of its kind to be set up by one of the clubs implicated in football\u2019s sexual abuse scandal, City will announce they want \u201cto do the right thing\u201d on the back of their independent inquiry, still ongoing after almost two and a half years, into Bennell\u2019s connections with the club, where he had a prominent role in the youth structure and used that position to prey on boys as young as eight. Bennell is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence, with the possibility of another criminal trial to follow next year, and a decision has now been taken, at the highest level of the club, that financial settlements should be offered to the boys he raped and molested during his years at City, taking into account the seriousness of the crimes, the psychological damage and potential loss of earnings. Many of those most affected will be eligible for six-figure payments. The same will apply to the victims of John Broome after City\u2019s independent inquiry into Bennell uncovered evidence that the man described in court as an \u201cindustrial-scale child molester\u201d was not the first paedophile to have an association with the club. Broome, who died in 2010, was another talent-spotter and junior coach. He was involved at City from 1964-71 \u2013 though, like Bennell, did not receive an official salary \u2013 and nine people so far have come forward to report him for serious sexual abuse, including rape. The figures are significantly higher when it comes to Bennell, who was convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys, aged eight to 14, from 1979-91, and has been described by the police as one of the worst paedophiles in UK criminal history, numbers-wise, with potentially hundreds of victims \u2013 in one case, even taking one of City\u2019s youngsters on to the pitch at Maine Road, the club\u2019s former ground, to abuse him behind the goal. Bennell, described by the judge as \u201csheer evil\u201d and \u201cthe devil incarnate\u201d, had two three-year spells within City\u2019s junior network, starting in his early 20s, between 1976 and 1984. He went on to have seven years as Crewe Alexandra\u2019s youth-team coach and has been imprisoned four times, three in England and once in the US. At least 86 other people have reported him in England \u2013 though that figure has not been updated since January 2018 \u2013 and his time at City will form a significant part of the Football Association\u2019s independent inquiry given some of the details that have subsequently emerged. One parent had complained to the club about Bennell having boys in his room on away trips and Steve Fleet, one of City\u2019s youth-team coaches in the late 1970s, told the Guardian last year that he had told the club of his own suspicions. Police documents from the 1990s question City\u2019s stance during the criminal investigation, with one detective suggesting the club\u2019s priority was to avoid damaging publicity. The now-deceased Len Davies, a scout who worked alongside Bennell, admitted that one of England\u2019s major football clubs was \u201cbeguiled and hoodwinked\u201d by the man, now 65, who liked to be known as \u201cthe star-maker.\u201d City have been facing civil action from a number of former players but the victims will now have the option of pursuing those cases through the courts or the \u201calternative pathway\u201d of taking part in a structured compensation scheme that has taken two years to put together. The club have decided it is \u201cthe right thing to do in order to give eligible survivors a level of closure as fast as possible\u201d. The scheme has been put together by Ravi Nayer, a partner at Pinsent Masons, in the legal firm\u2019s London office, and a QC, Frances Oldham, has been appointed as an independent adjudicator. Oldham previously chaired the Independent Jersey Care Inquiry, publishing a 2017 report into the island\u2019s child-abuse scandal, most notably at the Haut de la Garenne children\u2019s home. City know of around 40 survivors who encountered Bennell or Broome in the club\u2019s junior system, though the expectation is that number could rise substantially. Six feeder teams \u2013 Whitehill, Blue Star, Pegasus, Xerxes, Midas, and Adswood Amateurs \u2013 have been identified in Bennell\u2019s case. Three of his other junior sides \u2013 White Knowl, Palace and Glossop Juniors \u2013 also had clear links to City. Broome was the manager of Whitehill Boys, another of City\u2019s feeder teams. No connection has been found to show he and Bennell were associates in any way. The compensation scheme will mean the former players who were planning, or had initiated, legal action against the club can \u201cavoid the costs, time, emotional distress and complexity of a trial with an alternative dispute-resolution process\u201d. The idea is to \u201cprovide a speedier, cheaper and more predictable means of compensation than lengthy, expensive formal court litigation\u201d. The tariff will be based on a two-tier system taking into account the range of offences, the length of abuse and its effects on the victims. City\u2019s lawyers have designed the system around the type of payments that would result from a successful court action, though the Guardian\u2019s information is that some of the settlements will be higher. The club will also contribute to legal costs. That alone could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds bearing in mind the number of people who are affected. At the end of the process it is understood senior figures at City hope to arrange time with the victims by writing to them individually and fixing up face-to-face meetings to explain in detail the amount of work that has gone on behind the scenes and offer the apology that, until now, has not been forthcoming because of legal constraints. Even though the abuse happened under previous regimes \u2013 in Broome\u2019s case, more than 50 years ago \u2013 City\u2019s stance shows that the modern-day club have recognised it is their responsibility to do something about it. They are also acutely aware that, to many victims, it will be difficult to forgive the club or move forward with their lives until they have received an apology, as well as an acknowledgment that the abuse did happen and that, in some cases, it destroyed their chances of becoming professional footballers. Under the terms of the scheme City will request the necessary information on an \u201cinquisitorial rather than adversarial basis\u201d, with the claimants being asked to provide a statement of truth, as well as evidence that they played for the relevant teams and anything else that can corroborate what happened \u2013 for example, police statements and witness accounts. In some of the higher-level \u201ctier-two\u201d cases a report from a consultant psychiatrist will be required, which will be paid for by the club. Nobody who receives compensation will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, therefore avoiding the kind of controversy that engulfed Chelsea after it emerged they had paid \u00a350,000 in \u201chush money\u201d to one of their former players, Gary Johnson, who had been abused in the 1970s by Eddie Heath, then the club\u2019s chief scout. In other words, the victims of Bennell and Broome will be free to talk about their experiences and the way City have handled it. City have already spent around \u00a32m on the ongoing inquiry, led by Jane Mulcahy QC, into some of the events that have led the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, to talk about it being the worst crisis he can remember in the sport. The findings will eventually be made public and City\u2019s extensive background work in setting up the compensation scheme means the club are confident they have everything in place for claims to be \u201cresolved promptly, consistently and correctly\u201d. For some tier-one cases the entire process could be completed within seven weeks. City\u2019s scheme is being described as a \u201cvictim-first\u201d policy and in sharp contrast to what appears to be an entirely different approach at Crewe, who are also facing a number of civil cases following Andy Woodward\u2019s interview in the Guardian in November 2016, when their former player waived his anonymity to detail the years of abuse he encountered from Bennell in the club\u2019s youth system. As the Guardian reported last week, lawyers acting on behalf of Crewe and their insurers have written to one of Bennell\u2019s victims, Steve Walters, to say there is \u201cno reasonable explanation or justification\u201d why he waited until his mid-40s before reporting what had happened to him from the age of 13 to 14. Walters became the youngest first-team player in Crewe\u2019s history, at 16, when he made his debut in 1988 and was one of the 12 victims whose evidence led to Bennell\u2019s imprisonment last year. He has described Crewe\u2019s stance as \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
