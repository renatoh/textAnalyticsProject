The photographs of Chief Bratton, tanned and lean-jawed in his black, shiny-belted LAPD uniform, also show us a man it is easy to picture in the flash of police lights, a captured punk in an arm-lock, summoning a Tottenham/Peckham/Croydon PC with a curt: \"OK, pal. What next?\" It does not seem impossible that these hard attributes are exactly what made Mr Cameron so susceptible to Bratton, out of all the experienced, foreign ex-policemen he might have recruited from around the globe. Doesn't The Social Animal, by another popular American, David Brooks, teach us that we act on unconscious impulses all the time? If Brooks can joke that he should have called his daughter \"President of the United States Brooks\", Cameron's need for reassurance might explain the attraction of an incredibly tough cop who is virtually named Incredibly Tough Cop. No matter that the supercop in question retired from policing two years ago and now goes about in an executive suit and Herm\u00e8s ties, doing speaking engagements, dining at Elaine's and, as its chairman, selling \"trusted intelligence and scalable technology solutions\" for a security firm called Kroll. Yet Bratton retains, according to a New York magazine profile in 2009, a \"burning need for significance\", apparently still unmet. A friend told the magazine that he \"wants New York again\". Failing that, London would do. But why should London choose him? As much as Bratton is to be admired for his historic policing triumphs and accompanying insights, generously documented in his 1998 memoir, Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic, there still seems no compelling reason for the prime minister, reportedly urged on by his sidekick Steve Hilton, to want this semi-mythological figure to embark on a career in Britain, particularly \u2013 following the Met's Murdoch-related difficulties \u2013 given Bratton's taste for high living and his enthusiastic use of the press. As with plumbing, a cut-price deal might have been explicable. Equally, there might be a warm welcome for Bratton in the fields of strawberry picking or nursing. But to judge by the number of applicants for the Met job, super-policing is not an activity shunned by our indigenous officers, of whom we have such a surplus. Countering police indignation, Bratton's arrival as some sort of gang tsar has elicited from his many defenders a great willingness to endorse Cameron's enthusiasm for importing retired American professionals into domestic British affairs. \"Why,\" he argued, \"should not someone who has been a proven success overseas be able to turn around a force here at home?\" If it is, genuinely, more than a trick for humiliating the police, there seems no reason why this free-and-easy approach towards nationality, one more associated in the past with the arts, academics and the CEOs of international businesses, should not lead to US experts advising, at the highest level, on welfare, the NHS, prisons, counterespionage, the economy and schools. Have we really got it right on evolution? How about banking regulation? Not forgetting free speech: in one of his numerous promotional interviews, Bratton has said that if US police chiefs spoke about politicians as ours do, they would be fired. Long-standing traditions and differences cannot, in Bratton's view, be an excuse for what he has identified as \"parochial\" thinking. \"Anyone who looks only inwards is not going to be as successful as someone who looks outside, the world over,\" he says. Some have protested that this enlightened police maxim is never applied in reverse. They must have missed the influential movie, Bridesmaids, where we find the Irish officer Rhodes applying a total-tolerance philosophy to American traffic enforcement. All week, resentful officers and other critics of Cameron's protege have been accused of myopia, chippiness, insularity, complacency, a peasant-like fear of fresh thinking and a morally disgusting unwillingness, on the part of US-haters, to accept that this veteran of gun-enforced policing and supporter of capital punishment should not be imposed on our own useless \u2013 if less lethal \u2013 force. Nor, perhaps, should the injured pride, following Cheryl Cole's recent humiliation, on the spurious grounds that she was \"out of her comfort zone\" as a US X Factor judge, be ruled out as a reason why so many people feel that Bratton was an outrageous suggestion for chief of the Met and will be, if anything, even less appropriate as Cameron's special adviser. At least, if he'd got the Met job, Bratton would have had to move to Britain and stick around long enough to see the result of his supercopping, and even, possibly, to acquaint himself with the fact that Northern Ireland is \u2013 contrary to his current perception \u2013 a part of the UK. Being, it appears, entirely unaccountable, the consultancy role offers Bratton the chance to inform Cameron's thinking without being publicly challenged, then subsequently to deny responsibility for police failures; at the same time, he can take the credit for any successes. Improbable? Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has insisted on Bratton's habit of claiming credit for the innovations of others. Another problem with recruiting from so far away: whom do you believe? Although British objectors to Bratton have dwelt so far on the glaring cultural differences in police work, and on scepticism about the true impact of his \"broken windows\" policy, another major problem with his arrival as an adviser is, surely, that he has nothing to lose. Even an adviser like Philip Green, part-time Monaco resident that he is, has to live with the shame of his prattish paper on waste. But if the records of Bratton's well-known predecessors \u2013 Mrs Thatcher's Ian MacGregor, the Scottish-American head of the National Coal Board, and Ken Livingstone's Bob Kiley \u2013 offer any guide, the US policeman can feel confident, unlike a national, that his domestic reputation will survive intact. Kiley, for non-Londoners, was introduced in 2001 by a dazzled Ken, as the forthcoming saviour of the capital's transport system, following earlier triumphs in New York and Boston. He was offered a \u00a32.2m house in Belgravia and a succession of fabulously generous contracts, including one in 2004 for \u00a32.4m. A further \u00a32m was paid when he stood down and Kiley was still a \u00a33,200-a-day consultant in 2007, when he told the Evening Standard he was an alcoholic, adding: \"If you ask me what I actually do to earn my consultancy, I'd have to tell you in all honesty, 'not much'.\" True, for all we know, the miners' riots would have been far worse without an imported hate-figure, London would be impassable but for Kiley's efforts and Livingstone's only mistake, as with David Cameron, was in not replacing himself with a \"proven success from overseas\". They say the Danish prime minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, runs a very happy ship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
