It was summer, always a slow time for TV, so I thought: \u201cWhy not?\u201d The remit was that we would talk about anything and everything from a female point of view, but it didn\u2019t have to be limited to women\u2019s issues. I remember walking in, suited and booted, to the studios in Westminster and seeing [co-presenter] Nadia for the first time. She filled the room, all curls and breasts with her bohemian dress, sandals and rings on her toes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get on with that woman,\u201d I thought, because any woman with toe-rings is not my kind of woman. So I hid behind my newspaper. I know Nadia thought I was posh, but I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m Scottish. You don\u2019t get posh in Scotland, apart from Kirsty Young. I knew early that we were on to something good. Loose Women is unlike anything else on TV. The View, an American talk show, predates it, but that\u2019s quite political. The British take was to add humour. Over the years, various producers have come in with different ideas. Some have worked, some haven\u2019t, and we\u2019ve changed the set and the colourings a million times, but the absolute essence hasn\u2019t changed. There is no point in trying to add bells and whistles. We agreed it should follow the normal pattern of female conversation. When we ladies are out for lunch, we go from uproarious laughter to something topical to something bit teary. So we mimic that in the show. We switch from serious topics to emotional ones, to some sort of public debate, like: \u201cDo you iron your knickers?\u201d We did a month initially, and the viewing figures were good and we all thought it had potential, so when it was commissioned for a further 12-week run we hoped we were onto something. But it was only ever recommissioned in short bursts. We\u2019d have a fantastic wrap party: \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we brilliant?\u201d \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d \u201cWe love each other,\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Then we\u2019d have to wait weeks and weeks for a call. Nadia and I co-presented from 1999 until 2002 when she left to have her first daughter. At one point we lived together too, like Eric and Ernie. Nadia would roll in at three o\u2019clock in the morning, blind drunk, and I\u2019d have fallen asleep after Question Time. Nadia Sawalha, presenter We are called Loose Women because the format is loose. It\u2019s how women talk. One minute we\u2019re roaring with laughter, the next we\u2019re crying with misery. I\u2019d come from this hippy, gin-swilling, actressy background, and back in summer 1999 I\u2019d just come out of EastEnders, playing a gangster character called Annie Palmer, when I was asked to film the pilot. I was in makeup, flicking through OK! magazine, chatting about Victoria Beckham, not realising I was talking to the show\u2019s editor. She later told me she\u2019d decided I\u2019d got the part there and then. Jane Moore had a similar \u201cinterview\u201d. At the pilot, they asked her to look into the camera and say: \u201cHello, I\u2019m a Loose Woman.\u201d She said no. That\u2019s when the editor decided to offer Jane the job as a presenter. I\u2019ll never forget meeting Kaye. She had a great big newspaper, I believe it was the Guardian, and she kept shaking it, as if to show me she reads the big newspapers. All the women seemed highbrow and posh and I didn\u2019t understand why they needed me. Then I realised: opposites was actually what they needed. It was all about getting different types of women: four sassy, smart, witty, women who can talk the hind legs off a donkey. We only have celebrity guests on if they bring something to the show. Whoopi Goldberg was charming and loved me because I\u2019d been on EastEnders \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe she watched it! In the early days a man wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near the set, but now we have two Loose Men on the panel and we\u2019ve had Gok Wan and Freddie Flintoff on talking about their mental health, which would only happen on a women\u2019s show. I used to say to Kaye: \u201cIt won\u2019t have legs for long, this. What are we going to talk about?\u201d And she said: \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Think of a friendship that lasts for decades. The conversation goes on and on.\u201d We\u2019ve now been doing it for 20 years, and the 3,000th episode aired in May. We had a scream when we lived together. We were never stuck for something to say, even though I was the party girl and she wore the tweedy knickers. Loose Women celebrates 20 years this year. Watch weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
