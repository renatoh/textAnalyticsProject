While the annual Twilight Parade and the Dragon Races will be as popular as ever, one of the highlights is sure to be the spectacular Lanterns of the Terracotta Warriors, created by Chinese artist Xia Nan for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, and on site at Dawes Point for a limited time. Chinese New Year celebrations take place across the country in February, with Sydney festivities kicking off on 13 February Promises, promises A seal balancing a baby grand on its nose. An elephant headbutting the ground. A buffalo in full charge atop a piano. New Zealand sculptor Michael Parekowhai juggles humour, history and pop culture references in his work. Now Queensland\u2019s Gallery of Modern Art will host his first major solo exhibition, featuring many of his best-known pieces and some intriguing new work. Michael Parekowhai: The Promised Land is at Brisbane\u2019s Gallery of Modern Art from 28 March until 21 June The world at war For many Australians, the local cinema was their primary news source during the first world war. As global commemorations continue, Melbourne\u2019s Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) steps back in time with a recreation of the local picture palace and a program of shorts, advertisements, newsreels, propaganda and feature films like Alfred Rolfe\u2019s The Hero of the Dardanelles (1915) that were created to encourage recruitment. War Pictures: Australians at the Cinema 1914-1918 is at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne from 10 March until 12 July Human Touch What\u2019s the power of touch? When the Singaporean government denied drug smuggler Van Tuong Nguyen a final embrace from his mother before his execution, it demonstrated just how important it can be. The heartbreaking incident was part of the inspiration for Australian playwright Suzie Miller\u2019s new play Caress/Ache, which will have its world premiere at Sydney\u2019s Griffin Theatre next month. Caress/Acre opens at Griffin theatre, Sydney, from 27 February until 11 April Get your groove on The Preatures, Flight Facilities and Charlie XCX are going country, as part of the lineup for this year\u2019s Groovin the Moo.

Groovin the Moo begins in Oakbank on 25 April, before touring to Bunbury, Bendigo, Canberra, Maitland and Townsville.
