At least, that's what former punk drummer Gavin has been doing, until he decides to ditch the desk job to once more feel the heat of the lights and the spittle of the crowd. Joining him in search of lost youth is bass player Penny, a single mum who wants to prove to her daughter that she's still cool, and singer Danny, a sociology lecturer who gives classes on the transgressive impact of punk but has difficulty practising what he preaches. Lastly, there's Alan, an obsessive fan of the Guitar Hero videogame, who puts down his plastic guitar because a real one is easier. The initial scenes of Andy Barrett's play are a comic delight. Gavin, on drums, appears to have all the timekeeping abilities of the national rail network, while Danny breaks off between verses to check his BlackBerry. As with many formative groups, actual rehearsing occurs only in the short gaps between arguments about what direction the band should take. Much time is absorbed by Gavin's rants about punk becoming a pale, corporatised parody of itself. This seems to be borne out by an advert in the programme for a consultancy offering \"a three-chord marketing attack that will free your brand from bondage\". I tried ringing the number, and it's not a spoof. If there's a flaw in the drama, it's that the band become less interesting as they get better. But Giles Croft's production is well observed - particularly Robin Kingsland's passionately committed Gavin, who proves that there's nothing sorrier than a 50-year old man sporting a hairstyle best described as what's left of the Mohicans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
