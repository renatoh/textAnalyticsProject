Professionals scoffed at the idea of a young Japanese punching his weight in one of the world's toughest leagues. But merchandisers' jaws dropped when 5,000 of Nakata's compatriots made the trip to see his Serie A debut, and when Japanese tour operators promptly included a one-day package to the Umbrian capital as part of Italian holidays. That made for an average Japanese attendance of some 3,000 at Perugia games. Even more rewarding for the club's owners, the Gaucci family, were the subsequent orders for 70,000 \"Nakata No7\" Perugia shirts, which just happened to be made by the Gaucci-owned Galex sportswear firm. Within months of his arrival in Italy, it became clear that Nakata represented an inspired dual investment. On the field, his combination of midfield vision, ball-winning edge and a rare goalscoring touch make him a class act. Off it, his status as a Japanese sporting superstar makes him a marketing man's dream with his website, www.nakata.net, registering 200,000 hits a day. In terms of market value, the 24-year-old playmaker who will lead the joint hosts in next year's World Cup has been a gold mine. Although he spent most of last season on the bench at Roma as Francesco Totti's understudy, the club used Nakata to spearhead a marketing campaign in Japan which saw it open small AS Roma shops in Tokyo and Osaka. Perugia sold him on to Roma for $25m inside 18 months, and when Parma's young president Stefano Tanzi announced his $29m transfer this month it was a mark of the player's reputation that he stressed his club had bought Nakata for \"technical footballing\" merits and not as a marketing operation. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
