Twiggy, Amy Winehouse, Grayson Perry, JK Rowling and even Monty Python's emblematic foot all feature in a reworked version of the 1967 cover created for his birthday celebrations. Blake, often called the godfather of the British pop art scene, said: \"I've chosen people I admire, great people and some who are dear friends. \"I had a very long list of people who I wanted to go in but couldn't fit everyone in \u2013 I think that shows how strong British culture and its legacy of the last six decades is.\" Singer Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis, was \"chuffed\" to be included. \"To be on there with the likes of Vivienne Westwood, Mick Jagger and Paul Weller, just those three people alone, is amazing for me as I wouldn't put myself up with any of those,\" he said. Rowling said: \"Given that I've devoted quite a lot of time to gazing at the original Sgt Pepper album cover, you can perhaps imagine what it means to me to be featured.\" Playwright Tom Stoppard said his inclusion was \"an honour that outdoes delirium\" while singer Elvis Costello said: \"I always dreamed that I might one day stand in the boots of [Liverpool footballer] Albert Stubbins.\" The original 1967 artwork also featured James Dean, Bob Dylan, Karl Marx and Marilyn Monroe. The new version has been created for a special birthday celebration of Blake's life at Wayne Hemingway's Vintage festival at Boughton House, Northamptonshire, in July. Hemingway, co-founder of the Red or Dead fashion brand, said: \"The new artwork is a tribute to Britain's standing as the world's leading creative nation.\" It was \"an incredible honour\" for Blake to \"reimagine such an iconic work of art\", he said, adding: \"We are proud to be dedicating the Sunday at Vintage this year to celebrate his 80th birthday and creative and cultural legacy.\" Terry Jones, the actor, director and original Python, said: \"Monty Python is flattered to have had his foot selected, but there are better parts of his body available at very little cost.\" The foot itself was borrowed by Terry Gilliam from Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time, a work by 16th century Florentine painter Bronzino. His Python co-star, Michael Palin, added: \"It's a great tribute to a fine foot \u2013 just don't tell Bronzino or he'll want royalties.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
