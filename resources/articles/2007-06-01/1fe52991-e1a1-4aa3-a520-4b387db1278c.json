The Yorkshire club, who were relegated to the Unibond League last season, currently have no manager and only two players on the books but two applications have been made for a new team to compete in the Northern Counties East League, three divisions below the Unibond. One is for Scarborough Athletic, who have been formed by the Seadogs Trust. The other is for AFC Scarborough, who have been set up by Scobbie, but only one application will be accepted and, if both apply, neither will get a place. The two have until Sunday to produce a united application.\" Both are urged to discuss the best way forward,\" read a statement on Borough's website, \"and ensure that only one application is put forward .\" Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, has completed a two-day visit to Johannesburg and Cape Town and says that nothing can prevent the 2010 World Cup finals from being staged in South Africa. \"I'm a happy man,\" he said. \"Preparations are definitely on track. The enthusiasm is phenomenal.\" Blatter was briefed on developments and assured that significant progress had been made in all areas since his last visit a year ago. Internazionale's president, Massimo Moratti, has shrugged off concerns that his club could be forced to hand back the 2005-06 title after Covisoc, a group which monitors the finances of Italian clubs, stated that Inter would not have had the financial security to compete in the season if full details had been available. Moratti and Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, are being investigated after allegations that some transfer fees were inflated between 2003 and 2005 to secure fictitious capital gains. \"We are not worried in any way regarding the investigation on budgets,\" Moratti said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
