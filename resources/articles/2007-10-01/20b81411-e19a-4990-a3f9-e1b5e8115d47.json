For years, both possibilities have been tossed around in policy circles. Suddenly, within the space of barely a fortnight, both are serious prospects. Big companies such as Sainsbury and Vodafone will be able to get their in-house training schemes accredited so that they carry publicly recognised qualifications. And colleges, instead of just reheating qualifications cooked up by external bodies, will be able to create their own, subject to a consultation that has just been kicked off by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. It all adds to the impression that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has brought a new vigour to the party. But is it a change in direction? Some in the further education world who have been unhappy at what they see as an obsession with a dwindling group of qualifications have detected a slight swerve in direction by John Denham, the new minister. He has come to the job with a reputation for intelligence and being a good listener. We meet at Westminster Kingsway College. He has popped in to chat to staff and students and to find out from the latter how well the government's information about financial assistance is getting through. He believes in getting out and about to talk to people, and he is clearly good at making them feel listened to. \"I think you would see that what is already distinctive about the new department - I'm not just going to say about me - is the extent to which we are personally engaging as ministers in the detail of promoting skills in a way that hasn't happened previously.\" Denham also brings a reputation for following his principles, as he resigned from a ministerial job because he disagreed with the Iraq invasion. Full fat or semi-skimmed? So is he going to steer out of the groove laid down by predecessors? For instance, will he drop the insistence that only \"full fat\" qualifications will be funded and incline a more favourable ear to employers' wishes for support for smaller packets of training? \"I think that we have to be sensitive to the fact that employers want skills training that provides what they need for their employees in their workplace but I think as a society and as a government we've got to take a longer term view,\" he says. \"So have employers. The reality is that as every year goes by, fewer and fewer jobs are available to people who don't have formal qualification that they can present. It's a basic entry requirement into more and more jobs. And so if we put all of the emphasis, as some would have us do, on very short courses that meet a particular need in a particular job in a moment in time, in the long term we have a society that is under-qualified and is economically going to be a drag on all of us.\" Denham says his task is to strike a balance between supporting qualifications that are attractive to bosses and those that are effective tickets to other jobs if and when employees want to leave. Allowing in-house training schemes to go on the list of nationally approved qualifications, and thus be eligible for public subsidy, is in that vein, he says. \"We're moving forward much more quickly than had been planned on the accreditation of in-house schemes\". Another hint that the new guy was veering away from the orthodoxy of the immediate past was detected in his public statements about the social importance of raising skills. He says it is not a new policy direction, but that the economic case for raising skills has perhaps drowned out the social over the last couple of years. Denham is keen to disabuse any employers who might have misunderstood this. \"The business case for doing skills stands and we've neither diverted public money away from that, nor are we saying to business 'you've got to train for social reasons'. \"The reality is that people who care about skills have missed a trick by not saying that if you raise parents' skill levels, if you enable them to get a better job, if you give them higher aspirations, that is going to feed through to their children's own aspirations. So if we can be really successful in extending adult skills into the areas we haven't reached so far we will have a social impact as well as a business impact.\" The world according to Leitch Anyone carrying hopes that the Leitch report on skills, commissioned by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor, might not be quite the sacred text under the new minister as it was under his predecessor could be disappointed. \"I think that my job at the moment is to make sure that we implement it successfully,\" he says. \"I don't think Sandy Leitch ever wanted his work to become a dogmatic concrete block. It's something that sets out clearly the priorities in skills training and how we should go about delivering and everything I've said is entirely in tune with that.\" One criticism in the Leitch report was of the performance of the sector skills councils (SSCs), the 25 bodies set up by Labour to give employers a dominant voice in influencing the pattern of publicly funded training. \"We're revamping sector skills councils,\" Denham confirms. Since they have been around for five minutes does this mean they have proved a mistake? \"Well, if you go back to the Leitch report, I think the word that he used was 'patchy' , so he said we should re-license and refocus their mission.\" That will be a job for the new Commission on Employment and Skills, a body proposed by Leitch and not quite yet fully mustered. How effectively it licks the SSCs into shape will partly decide whether Labour finally brings in laws to force employers to train. Denham says that \"the strong preference is to get this real progress by voluntarism, by people believing that it is the right thing to do. \"In 2010 the commission will look at the issue but I'm not sitting around for three years waiting until I can get the chance to legislate. I would much rather get into the position where in 2010 everyone will say 'why bother to legislate; we've cracked the problem'.\" The minister does not want to talk in more detail about just how employers may be cajoled into taking their SSCs more seriously. But he says he welcomes the national debate that Niace (the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education) has started with the launch of its commission into adult education. \"I just think it's always worthwhile having informed groups like Niace saying 'let's take stock of where we are at the moment, let's have an honest view of it and come up with ideas about moving forward in the future', Denham says. \"One of the things that I find coming into this job is that people say that adult education has disappeared, and then you find out that more people are participating than were participating a few years ago. It's quite true that some of them are now paying fees who were previously publicly subsidised but it isn't true that the activity has disappeared everywhere.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
