There were empty spaces beneath the Christmas trees in numerous Guardian-reading households, including Steve Menary's, despite the fact that he had ordered his children's presents in mid-November. The company was the online retailer Lazybone. \"I've tried ringing but can never get through and when I emailed for a refund the message bounced back,\" he says. Penny Aldred has been waiting since September for a dehumidifier from Coopers of Stortford. When she rang, she says she was not given the option of talking to flesh and blood. Instead, an automated being reeled off contact addresses. Her attempt to email was then rejected. Meanwhile, Lynne Farquhar is despairing over a crate of wine ordered from Giordano wines in early October. She has variously been told that some bottles had broken and a new batch had been ordered, that the crate had been left in her porch (she doesn't have one) and that the postal depot had been unable to deliver. Companies should agree a date with their customers by which time orders are to be delivered. If they are not, the customer can declare the company in breach of contract and demand a refund. If no deadline was agreed, the seller should deliver within 30 days of the order. The onus is on the seller to get the goods safely to their destination and to prove that they have done so. If there is a dispute, set everything down in writing including a deadline for delivery and if the company has not sent the items or refunded the money within 30 days you can turn to the small claims court. Happily, Menary and Farquhar have now finally received their orders after invoking the media and the courts, but Giordano has so far not responded to the Guardian's overtures. \u00b7 Send your consumer grievances to Dear Anna, at Shopping, 3rd Floor, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER email: consumer@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
