The German ohms and French amps in the electricity system at Sunderland magistrates court blacked out the building just as the last stand of the pound and ounce was due to begin. The bench, barristers and a circus of imperial weights and measures experts shifted boxes of law books half a mile - or a little less than a kilometre - uphill to the city council chamber for the start of a far-reaching EU test case, drawing on sections of Magna Carta, Latin tags and the fuel problems of his lawyer's Bentley, in which greengrocer Steve Thoburn is hoping to defend the traditional British right to ignore the metric system. \"This dates back to the 1864 Metric Weights and Measures Act,\" said his barrister, Michael Shrimpton, a constitutional expert. EU insistence on metric-only sales rode roughshod over parliament. \"We have always tolerated eccentricity in this country, and if a customer wants to go to Mr Thoburn and order 0.45359337 kilos of bananas instead of a pound, that act says he is perfectly entitled to do so.\" Mr Thoburn's stand is for pounds and ounces devotees to be allowed the same flexibility, which his market stall in Sunderland allows them to do. He denies two counts of selling bananas in imperial weights only to undercover staff of Sunderland city council, which has brought the prosecution. Eleanor Sharpston QC, for the council, said that the case was about enforcing the will of parliament, rather than Brussels, and avoiding confusion in shoppers' minds. She said: \"This prosecution is entirely brought to enforce a valid act of parliament which is the law of the land.\" Mr Shrimpton said Mr Thoburn, 36 and a father of two, was a John Hampden of the weighing scales, whose \"courage has implications far beyond greengrocers, bananas and the fair city of Sunderland\". He told the court: \"The European is entitled to his policy. What he is not entitled to do is to apply that policy in defiance of the British parliament.\" The case hinges on whether the EU's 1994 units of measurement regulations, nodded through by the Commons without serious discussion, take precedence over the 1985 Weights and Measures Act, which continued the century-old tradition of allowing businesses and customers to opt for either system. Mr Shrimpton admitted that petrol sales had in effect sold the metric pass. He said: \"I never understand what 110 litres is when I put it into my Bentley.\" He drew strength from the number of journalists in court from the United States, the world's main bastion of imperial measures, and pointed out that the undercover raid had taken place - \"whether significantly or not, I don't know\" - on July 4. There had been no need for cloak and dagger work, he said, as Mr Thoburn not only made no attempt to hide his love of pounds and ounces, but also actually shouted it, in the manner of market traders. The case is the first of a potential series involving recalcitrant retailers across Britain, whose loyalty to imperial measures is supported by the UK Independence Party and celebrities. Goodwill messages for Mr Thoburn have been winged to Sunderland by Jilly Cooper, Keith Waterhouse and Ian Botham among others. The leader of the UKIP, Jeffrey Titford, who admitted being a European MP, said: \"This case will highlight the way that the EU is imposing its will on British culture.\" His confidence in victory was echoed by Vivian Linacre, director of the British Weights and Measures Association, who said: \"Ultimately this will go our way, but it could go all the way to the House of Lords first.\" The legal costs are expected to top pounds 250,000, but the affair has been commercially encouraging for Mr Thoburn who is a local hero in Sunderland. He recently expanded his market stall to include a shop over the road, where he hopes that his confiscated imperial-only scales will eventually have pride of place. The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
