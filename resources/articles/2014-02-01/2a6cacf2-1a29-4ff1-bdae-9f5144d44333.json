It \u2013 or rather they \u2013 are the avian symbol of conjugal bliss, for they are commonly assumed to mate for life (although recent research on their lifestyle suggests they may be no more monogamous than humans). What really underwrites their place in romantic legend, at least from the time of Chaucer's Parliament of Fowls, is the billing and cooing that gives them their name. Turrrrr, turrr, turrr, they whisper lovingly \u2013 that's where the turtle in the Song of Solomon comes from \u2013 while enticingly puffing out their chests. Sadly, they are becoming less and less common for familiar reasons \u2013 not enough for them to eat in Britain, and too many people wanting to eat them in the Mediterranean. Don't cook them, feed them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
