The target was believed to be the brainchild of the Labour government rather than the Olympic organisers and was widely quoted during London's successful bidding process. But less than seven months before the London Games are due to begin, only 110,000 extra people have taken up a new sport and Robertson, the minister for sport and the Olympics, said: \"It is disappointing \u2013 a million sounds like a target that was plucked off the wall and it was.\" However, he was quick to defend a new initiative in schools and a \u00a3100m investment in sports facilities across the country and also the \u00a381m that is being spent on the opening and closing ceremonies for the Games. \"Do I think it's money well spent? Yes I do,\" Robertson told the Sunday Times. \"The opening is a spectacular. Get it wrong and we will spend three or four days batting back why was the opening ceremony such a failure. It will kick the thing off in the worst possible way. \"Given the importance we are putting as a country and using 2012 to drive economic growth and tourism, it would be foolish not to spend what is necessary to lay on a good opening ceremony. Danny Boyle [artistic director for the opening ceremony] is a top professional and has produced an extraordinarily good ceremony.\" Robertson also underlined that he feels the Great Britain team are on target for fourth place in the overall medals table at this year's Games. \"If you look at where we are across the Olympic sports at this stage in the cycle compared to Beijing, the number of medals achieved in world championships and equivalent competitions, we are better off.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
