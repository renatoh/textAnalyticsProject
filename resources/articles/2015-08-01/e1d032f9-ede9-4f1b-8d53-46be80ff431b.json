The leader of the house appeared on Channel Nine on Friday morning, saying a referendum \u2013 traditionally used to change elements of the constitution \u2013 on same-sex marriage was unnecessary. \u201cWe have decided to put it to the people. Obviously that should be done through a plebiscite, because there is absolutely no reason to change the constitution. The attorney general [Brandis] has made that entirely clear,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cA referendum would cost a great deal of money, in fact only to achieve no outcome because there is no legal basis for a referendum.\u201d The Coalition decided, after a marathon six-hour meeting on Tuesday, to reject a free vote on same-sex marriage. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said afterwards the Coalition would take the issue to the people in the form of a plebiscite or a referendum. But the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters on Friday that nothing has been settled. \u201cAs far as consulting the public through a plebiscite, that\u2019s not yet determined. The mechanism\u2019s not yet determined, the timing of it is not yet determined,\u201d he said. The social services minister, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday night backed a referendum. The threshold to pass a referendum is high, as it requires a majority of people in a majority of states to agree with a proposal. As a result, few referendums have been carried. \u201cWhen you have a referendum, there is an opportunity for both sides of this debate to be fairly put to the Australian people, for all of the issues to be fully considered and presented I think in an even-handed way,\u201d Morrison, an opponent of same-sex marriage, told ABC TV\u2019s 7.30 program on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been having a very even-handed debate on this issue.\u201d Morrison was slapped down by Brandis, himself a lawyer, who said there is \u201cno legal doubt\u201d that changing the constitution to allow same-sex marriage was unnecessary. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that there will be a referendum on this question,\u201d he said during Senate question time on Thursday. \u201cIf there were a public vote, it clearly would be a plebiscite.\u201d Turnbull has also shot down the idea of a referendum, saying that a plebiscite, on the other hand, is \u201csomething that can be done\u201d. Despite the public spats, Pyne has denied that a schism has formed in the leadership team of the Liberal party. \u201cThe prime minister and I are tight as a drum,\u201d Pyne said. Pyne acknowledged that he lobbied for the Liberal party and National party to hold separate party room meetings to decide on the free vote, after news emerged that he had personally intervened and asked the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, not to bring his party to Tuesday\u2019s joint meeting. \u201cMy first preference is that this matter should be dealt with by the parliament, through a free vote. And the Liberal party should have had the chance to discuss that on its own,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cWhether we then had a subsequent joint party meeting with the National party \u2013 of course we would have.\u201d Pyne had been critical of the prime minister for including the Nationals in the vote, accusing him of \u201cbranch-stacking\u201d by using the Nationals to bolster the \u201cno\u201d vote. \u201cMr Pyne doesn\u2019t run the show, Mr Abbott does,\u201d Nationals MP George Christensen said. \u201cThe Nationals have a right to be in the party room, and if we\u2019ve got ministers in there saying we don\u2019t want Nationals there when decisions are being made, boy oh boy, isn\u2019t it going to be tricky for them if they take a different point of view in every policy? It was only right and appropriate and fair that Nationals were in the party room,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday night. Labor has accused the Coalition of dysfunction. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy in my view that the Liberal party of Robert Menzies set up on the basis of individualism has resorted to basically rorting their own party room processes as Christopher very correctly nailed the prime minister on just this week,\u201d infrastructure spokesman Anthony Albanese told Channel Nine. \u201cThe problem here isn\u2019t that Tony Abbott is stuck in the past, it\u2019s that he wants the rest of Australia to go back there and keep him company.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
