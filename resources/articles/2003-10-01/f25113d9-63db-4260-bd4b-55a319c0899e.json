Given three months left to live by a doleful doctor, she sits down and writes a list entitled \"10 things to do before I die\". Her list seems to involve standing in the rain in a clinging T-shirt, recording birthday messages for her infant daughters and romping off on a tender affair with a troubled soul she meets down the local laundrette (Mark Ruffalo). I forget what else was on Ann's list and soon lost track of the items she'd ticked off, though I did find myself idly wishing that she'd chop-chop and get a move on. And yet this movie will simply not be rushed. Shrilly pleading its imminent demise, Isabel Coixet's drama proceeds to malinger for so long that you half suspect the whole thing is just a ruse to win our sympathy. Along the way it manages to squander the considerable talents of Polley and Ruffalo (not to mention Debbie Harry as Ann's caustic mom). Coixet's florid second person narration (\"so you're going to die ...\") grates from the start. Later, however, the film's tyrannical self-regard grows increasingly creepy. Hunting a replacement wife for her husband, Ann discovers a woman living opposite who is also called Ann. This, one realises, is the perfect (indeed only) qualification for the role. For what better substitute for Ann than Ann, a handpicked Ann that will serve as a constant reminder of the earlier Ann? In this way Ann can live on for years and years, and not just in the form of her stack of pre-recorded birthday messages. The future's bright. The future's Ann. \u00b7 My Life Without Me is showing at the Odeon West End on Sunday October 26 at 9pm and Monday October 27 at 1.30pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
