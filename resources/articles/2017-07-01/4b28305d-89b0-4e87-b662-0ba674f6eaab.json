Activists say Chinese security services have made the 56-year-old\u2019s life a living hell since her jailed husband was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2010, to the fury of China\u2019s one-party rulers. Liu Xia has never been accused, let alone convicted of any crime. But because of her husband\u2019s activism, she has been forced to live under constant surveillance and in almost total isolation at their Beijing home. Her physical and psychological condition is said to have deteriorated dramatically during this time. \u201cThey have turned her home into a prison,\u201d in complete violation of Chinese law, said Jerome Cohen, a leading authority in China\u2019s criminal justice system and human rights. Liu Xia\u2019s plight has been so desperate that friends believe the main reason Liu Xiaobo wanted to leave China for treatment was not to boost his chances of survival but to spare her further suffering. Friends and supporters called on western governments to help ensure her safe passage out of China on Thursday, after Liu\u2019s death was announced. \u201cWe are very worried about Liu Xia,\u201d said author and activist Tienchi Martin-Liao, a longtime friend. \u201cIf she cannot leave the country she will not have much time. We have to do something.\u201d Hu Jia, another activist and friend, said: \u201cLiu Xia has suffered a near complete physical and mental breakdown. Her father passed away last year, followed by her mother. Now she has just lost the love of her life. My God: she must be the most heartbroken person on earth.\u201d \u201cWe must now embrace Liu Xia with all our strength and tell her: \u2018Do not give up. Do not be scared! We will get you out!\u2019 We must fight for her freedom,\u201d Hu added. Cohen, the faculty director of New York University\u2019s US-Asia Law Institute, urged foreign governments to \u201cput enormous pressure on the Chinese leadership finally to do the humane thing. The world powers should press for giving her the option to leave China. And if she chooses to remain in China for eliminating the oppressive conditions that she has suffered through the last seven years.\u201d As he spoke, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson said he mourned Liu Xiaobo\u2019s \u201ctragic passing\u201d and called for Liu Xia\u2019s release. \u201cI call on the Chinese government to release Liu Xia from house arrest and allow her to depart China, according to her wishes,\u201d he said. Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based activist for Human Rights Watch, also urged action, warning: \u201cIt is likely that the Chinese government will continue to silence her after Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death to prevent her becoming a symbol of freedom and resistance.\u201d However, within minutes of Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death there were already signs the Communist party might be attempting to silence Liu Xia. Mo Zhixu, a Chinese activist and writer, said he had been unable to make contact with her or establish her whereabouts following her husband\u2019s death. \u201cI am extremely worried about Liu Xia\u2019s condition,\u201d he said. Activists have expressed anger and frustration at the muted nature of international calls for the couple\u2019s freedom. In a statement, the Nobel committee said most governments had responded to the news that Liu had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and wanted to leave China \u201cwith silence and belated, hesitant reactions\u201d. \u201cIt is a sad and disturbing fact that the representatives of the free world, who themselves hold democracy and human rights in high regard, are less willing to stand up for those rights for the benefit of others,\u201d it said. Wang, from Human Rights Watch, said that after a period of deafening silence those governments now needed to find their voice to ensure Liu Xia\u2019s safety. \u201cThe best way to honour Liu Xiaobo would be to press the Chinese government to free Liu Xia,\u201d she said.
