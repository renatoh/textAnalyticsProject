The former England Under-21 forward has been training with Sunderland for the past two weeks in a bid to kick-start his career after refusing to sign a new contract with the Hornets. Hemel Hempstead-born Smith has only to agree personal terms with Sunderland as the manager Mick McCarthy attempts to strengthen a squad decimated by summer sales in the wake of huge financial problems. Smith will be familiar to Sunderland fans already, having scored the goal that dumped the Wearsiders out of the FA Cup last season when his twice-taken penalty clinched a 1-0 fifth-round victory for Watford on their way to the semi-finals. The signing of Smith may re-ignite feelings of optimism among the Wearsiders' faithful that a new messiah has arrived from Vicarage Road to emulate the enormous impact Kevin Phillips had for them. When Phillips was signed from Watford by Peter Reid in 1997 the young striker arrived at a club in need of some fresh impetus amid a stalling league campaign. Phillips proceeded to break Brian Clough's post-war scoring record with 35 goals in his first season, including netting in nine consecutive home matches - another record - before Sunderland were promoted to the Premiership the following term. The manager may be different now but the circumstances Sunderland find themselves in are just as pressing. McCarthy may have been prompted to move for Smith after his side's shortcomings became glaringly evident in Tuesday night's 4-2 Carling Cup defeat by Third Division Huddersfield Town. The 22-year-old Scottish striker Kevin Kyle got both goals for the home side but McCarthy was forced to rest his strike partner Marcus Stewart as their paucity of quality was cruelly exposed by the Terriers. The former Republic of Ireland manager must have thought he had finally lifted the gloom of his tenure at the Stadium of Light after arresting a run of ten successive defeats - and 14 in total - since he took charge of the sinking Sunderland ship at the end of last season. A 2-1 Carling Cup first-round win at Mansfield last month was the prelude to four league victories on the trot for McCarthy as appearances suggested he might have finally turned Sunderland's fortunes around. But given that he had to rely on a last-minute headed goal from goalkeeper Mart Poom for a 1-1 draw at Derby last weekend, McCarthy's decision to add Smith to his squad may prove as prudent an addition as Phillips's did for Reid. Sunderland will have a chance to restore the momentum on Saturday when Reading visit the Stadium of Light; if he is signed in time, they will be hoping Smith's impact is as immediate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
