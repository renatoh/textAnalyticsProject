Its basic pitch boils down to \u201cwe messed up your privacy and gave your data to all sorts, and let foreign actors screw up your elections \u2013 now let\u2019s see what we can do with banking!\u201d That\u2019s the quick way to view its announcement of Libra, which will be operated by Calibra, a new Facebook subsidiary. David Marcus, the brain behind it at Facebook, used the company\u2019s typically humble phrasing to explain it thus: \u201cThe mission for Libra is a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.\u201d You probably thought that we already had a global currency and financial infrastructure, and you\u2019d be right: a loose alliance of banks and central banks around the world keeps the lights on and the bills paid. So why does Facebook want to tear it all down? Libra isn\u2019t, strictly, a cryptocurrency (for tediously technical reasons). Unlike the yo-yoing bitcoin, its value is set against a basket of what we\u2019ll call \u201creal\u201d currencies such as the peso, pound and dollar; that\u2019s decided by the Libra Association of about 100 organisations including Facebook, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, PayPal, Spotify, Uber and others. They\u2019ve each paid at least $10m to be involved and thus endowed the project with a $1bn pot. Essentially, Calibra will \u201cprint\u201d lots of digital numbered banknotes, and you\u2019ll buy them (with real money) and transfer them to someone else in exchange for some service or good; they can then either convert them back to real money, or use them to buy something from someone, who can then either convert them to real money, or use them to \u2026 you get the idea. It\u2019s like buying credits on Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo, except you\u2019ll have to prove your identity to Facebook via a passport or national ID card. The aims are far loftier than buying games: \u201cFrom the beginning, Calibra will let you send Libra to almost anyone with a smartphone, as easily and instantly as you might send a text message and at low-to-no cost,\u201d says the Facebook announcement. At this, tens of millions of people in Africa, India and Afghanistan will roll their eyes. They\u2019ve been sending money \u2013 real money, not tokens \u2013 to each other on mobile phones (not even smartphones) since 2007 via SMS, using the M-Pesa system, which doesn\u2019t require banks or Facebook. What else? \u201cIn time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, like paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.\u201d Of course, millions of people across Europe and Asia already do this every day, paying with their phone or even smartwatch. To know why Facebook thinks this is revelatory you have to understand that the US has only recently shifted from swiping credit cards to chip-and-pin; people in shops there look at you strangely if you wave your phone at the card reader. And as for \u201cpaying bills with the push of a button\u201d, only those ensconced in the primitive US banking system could think that was smart. It\u2019s a place that relies on paper cheques so heavily that if you automate a bank payment to someone, the bank prints out a cheque and physically sends that. So Libra seems to be solving problems Americans have and most don\u2019t. Facebook insists that 1.7 billion people without bank accounts in developing countries need it; strange they can\u2019t see that M-Pesa fits the bill already. Overall, it\u2019s not reassuring that Facebook is doing this. First, it has a track record of screwing up when it comes to looking after or respecting your data \u2013 Cambridge Analytica and the Onavo VPN that spied on users being just two obvious examples. Second, it has problems being consistent in how it applies its rules: see the many, many rows over content. It\u2019s ignorant of its naivete, and so big it repeatedly causes huge problems. Third, its size and US-centredness means that the new currency could gain critical mass, and take on a life of its own. And that carries gigantic risks. Lana Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, put it succinctly: \u201cFacebook wants to be/is now a government.\u201d But have Marcus and Zuckerberg thought of the inevitable problems that will emerge? What if other governments don\u2019t like what Libra does to their local currency, perhaps by undermining financial export rules? If they block Facebook, what happens to citizens\u2019 money tied up in Libra? The problem is, Mark Zuckerberg can\u2019t be deposed by anybody, not even his board. I\u2019m worried that the future involves being forced to use Facebook in order to make everyday transactions, and that the privacy promises will evaporate. Our banking system isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 hello, 2008 \u2013 but it\u2019s a lot better regulated than Facebook ever has been. Libra doesn\u2019t sound like freedom. \u2022 Charles Arthur is a former technology editor of the Guardian and author of Cyber Wars: Hacks That Shocked the Business World"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
