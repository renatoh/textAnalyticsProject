I just thought of that!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets after his call for the Apple boycott were all sent from an Apple iPhone. Apple refused to cooperate after a US federal magistrate ordered the company to help the FBI unlock the iPhone, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, describing the demand as \u201cchilling\u201d. In a letter published on the company\u2019s website, Cook responded by saying Apple would oppose the order and calling for public debate. \u201cThe United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand,\u201d he wrote. While Cook took pains to stress that Apple was \u201cshocked and outraged\u201d by the San Bernardino shooting last December \u2013 \u201cwe have no sympathy for terrorists\u201d \u2013 he said company is determined to resist the court order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
