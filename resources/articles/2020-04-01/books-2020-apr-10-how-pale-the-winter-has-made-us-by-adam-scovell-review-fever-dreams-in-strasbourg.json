Especially impressive was the high-wire act of Scovell\u2019s prose: his narrator, a young man pursuing a fervid obsession with moths, spoke with reserve and eloquence from a state of utmost madness. Now, in his follow-up, How Pale the Winter Has Made Us, Scovell gives voice to a new narrator who similarly conceals a psychotic frenzy behind a facade of self-possession, although her breakdown is sparked less by obsession than by alienation. Isabelle is an English \u00e9migr\u00e9 living with her French partner in Strasbourg. As winter sets in, she receives word from London that her father, a \u201cfailed painter\u201d, has hanged himself in a public park. The news arrives with \u201cacidic\u201d heartlessness from her mother, an abusive woman whose years of mistreatment culminate in an insistence that the funeral is Isabelle\u2019s responsibility. Isabelle can\u2019t turn to her partner for support because he has gone abroad, having fled \u201cthe growing frost of our relationship\u201d. So, alone on foreign soil, constricted by grief and solitude, this young woman\u2019s psyche splinters, and her distress manifests in harrowing phantasmagoria. At the edges of her vision, she begins to catch sight of the Erl-King: a skeletal spirit from Saxon folklore who devours wayward souls and seems to be hungry for hers. Desperate to outrun the ghoul \u2013 while also evading her mother\u2019s malice, dispelling thoughts of her father\u2019s body, and hiding her distress from her partner \u2013 Isabelle wanders the labyrinth of Strasbourg, aimless and anxious. Tranquillity via psychogeography is her subconscious intention. Immersing herself in the estranging city, she hopes to dissolve her woes in its hidden histories. Along the way she uncovers residual traces of bygone figures whose lives have left impressions on the streets: Goethe, Gutenberg, Gustave Dor\u00e9. But as Isabelle repeatedly finds these figures themselves \u201chiding from spectres of lost fathers\u201d, their reconstructed narratives become projections of the turmoil she is trying to suppress. Profoundly withdrawn from the world around her, she can\u2019t see that her dispassionate ruminations on place are also self-lacerating expressions of her trauma \u2013 and her blindness leaves her even more vulnerable to the Erl-King. The results are deeply unnerving, but Isabelle\u2019s fever dreams occasionally open on to an otherworldly beauty. Admittedly, those who anticipate pulse-quickening thrills from a story of madness and the macabre will be frustrated by the languid pace and sentences that indulge in extravagances such as: \u201cThe sharing of this wintery world would have broken the swelling spell that was dragging me pleasurably under the damp pavements within tenderly vile embraces.\u201d Then, too, with a male author voicing a female narrator who sounds like an echo of her male predecessor, the novel seems prepared to inflame live debates about the proprietorship of gender identities, not least when the self-harming Isabelle describes, at length, being raped by the Erl-King. But Scovell doesn\u2019t aspire to realism: instead he invests his talents in hallucinatory imagery, haunting atmospherics and prose that again blends the stately melancholia of WG Sebald with the logorrhoea of Thomas Bernhard. Abstruse and florid as Scovell\u2019s style can be, its rhythms over time become incantatory, and its mournful musicality and serpentine recursions are as hypnotic here as in Mothlight. And while its simple transference to another narrator may suggest a limit to his creative powers, diminishing Isabelle\u2019s distinctive persona, Scovell scales up something his debut confined to domestic settings: a disorienting effect described by Isabelle as the \u201cquiver[ing]\u201d of \u201ctemporal instability\u201d. In fact, How Pale the Winter Has Made Us is at its best when it maximises Mothlight\u2019s miniature trials of this effect, giving them a citywide sweep. Strasbourg itself is, of course, a nexus of unstable energies\u2013 it has long been at the mercy of national borders in flux, and anglophone outsiders can be baffled by its atmospheric oscillations between the French and German languages \u2013 but now Scovell adds time to the mix. As Isabelle\u2019s historical sense of Strasbourg intermingles different eras, distilling centuries of upheavals into split seconds, we come to perceive her surroundings with time-lapse vision. Chronology collapses. Tenses blur; timelines twist together. Present day boulevards are overlaid with the ghost images of ancient events, while people embody multiple selves simultaneously, from youth to prime to imminent death, with all the years of their lives made visible in an instant. If Scovell\u2019s narrator suffers the shredding apart of her selfhood, her extremis at least offers readers this improbable gift: a new form of sight extending beyond the moment that meets our eyes. It\u2019s not enough to save Isabelle from her own worst impulses, but it inflects her descent with flashes of uncanny calm, occasional serenity, to spare us from spiralling headlong with her into abject darkness. \u2022 How Pale the Winter Has Made Us is published by Influx (RRP \u00a39.99).
