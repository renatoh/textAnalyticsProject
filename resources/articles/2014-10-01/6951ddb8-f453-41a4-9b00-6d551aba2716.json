Two health thinktanks claim that improvements in recent years to vital NHS services such as GP consultations, planned surgery and treatment in A&amp;E \u2013 in terms of both quality and access \u2013 are \u201cstarting to go into reverse\u201d. Their findings will worry ministers, who have pledged to enhance NHS care in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal and to keep waiting times low, especially with winter and next year\u2019s election looming. Research by the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation also found it is getting harder for both children and adults to access mental health services promptly, growing numbers of whom are facing \u201cunacceptably long waits\u201d for treatment. They blame a surge in demand for healthcare coupled with the NHS\u2019s unprecedented financial squeeze for what they say are troubling signs that, by some key measures, care is in decline. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the slippage in standards in some areas is so great that \u201ccare providers, policymakers and the public need to keep asking searching questions about the point at which declines in quality are no longer tolerable\u201d. The thinktanks\u2019 analysis of official datasets, looking at more than 200 indicators of NHS care in England, found: \u2022 The number of patients experiencing a \u201ctrolley wait\u201d, a delay of at least four hours between the decision to admit them at A&amp;E and their arrival on a ward, rose from 93,905 in 2010-11, to 167,941 in 2013-14 \u2013 an increase of 79% \u2022 One in ten patients had to wait more than the supposed 18-week maximum for planned treatment, mainly elective surgery such as cataract removal, in 2014 \u2022 Patients are waiting four days longer for such treatment than they did in 2010 \u2022 Hospital A&amp;E units missed the NHS target of treating and either admitting or discharging 95% of A&amp;E patients within four hours for over a year in 2013-14 \u2022 Waiting times for mental health patients to be assessed by a specialist have risen by a third, and in 2013 such patients waited almost twice as long to be assessed as people with physical ailments did \u2022 The number of nurses working in psychiatric hospitals has fallen by 13% since 2010, despite a 17% rise in the number of patients detained for treatment. The researchers also found that patients are finding it harder to get a GP appointment and 250,000 fewer older people now receive free social care services. The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said: \u201cThis authoritative report is proof that, despite what he claimed at Tory conference, NHS standards are dropping under David Cameron. \u201cPeople know from their own experience that NHS waiting lists are spiralling upwards and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to see a GP. Mental health services are in crisis too. When the experts warn David Cameron that he\u2019s throwing away a decade of hard-won NHS progress, it is arrogance in the extreme for him to ignore the facts.\u201d The Patients Association said the thousands of calls a year to its patient helpline \u201cpaint a very poor picture of health and social care services in England\u201d and underscore the report\u2019s findings. Katherine Murphy, its chief executive, said patients regularly end up lying on a trolley as they wait to be admitted. \u201cIt is simply not acceptable that standards in the NHS have been allowed to decline so much, and patients deserve far better,\u201d she added. The Department of Health said that no patient should end up waiting on a trolley. \u201cLong waits for a bed are unacceptable and we expect hospitals to get patients to wards quickly\u201d, a spokesman said. \u201cWe know the NHS is under pressure but the vast majority of people are seen and treated quickly and we\u2019re giving the NHS extra support to keep services sustainable year-round.\u201d But the latest official NHS waiting time data showed the number of patients waiting to receive planned treatment within 18 weeks reached almost 3.3m in August, its highest level since January 2008, despite a blitz on the backlog ordered by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
