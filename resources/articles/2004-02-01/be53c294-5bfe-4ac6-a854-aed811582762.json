Mr Smith admitted his \"frustration and impatience\" with the system and revealed he was continuing to withhold \"significant\" payments from Electronic Data Systems, the system's US-based suppliers. Design and software failings meant the system was still not working properly but, he told MPs, the company had assured him and the chief executive of the CSA that any difficulties would be ironed out by this autumn. He said: \"We have been assured that there is a recovery programme in place and that the system is retrievable - in other words it can be made to work properly, rather than it needing to be scrapped.\" But the minister, who was speaking at the Commons work and pensions select committee's inquiry into poverty, was pressed by MPs on whether he would be prepared to abandon the system altogether. He said: \"When you have been through the sort of experience we, and all the clients at the CSA have been through on this, you ask some hard questions about whether it really can be made to work, given that the original commitments that were made weren't fulfilled. \"Now we are assured that it can be, but if that turned out not to be the case, then we might not have an alternative.\" Last year MPs blamed glitches in the computer's maintenance calculation system, installed last March, for delays in the introduction of child support reforms. Mr Smith said today: \"The under-performance of the child support system, the new technology, certainly doesn't help.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
