Brighton's campaign has been disrupted of late by a series of postponements and the need to replace their previously unplayable pitch - this was their first league game at home since New Year's Day, when Southend inflicted their first home defeat since August. While Brighton's recent return to relative prosperity has been remarkable, their bank balance seems insignificant compared with that of Sam Hammam's Cardiff. David Hughes, the six-foot four-inch centre-back whose arrival from Shrewsbury this week for \u00a3450,000 pushed their season's spending over \u00a32.5million, started only on the bench. They have the bulging wallet to match their First-Division aspiration, but not all their bids are successful - a \u00a31.2m offer for Brighton's much-hyped striker Bobby Zamora was turned down. That they could make such a bid, and that Brighton could refuse it, says much about the good health of both clubs. The Albion were right to say no. In a first half that they dominated until the closing minutes, Zamora was at the heart of all their best moves, impressing as much for his attitude and application as for his ability with head and foot. He did, though, miss the one clear chance they created, side-footing straight at Mark Walton from Poole Watson's 13th-minute cross. His goal, two minutes later, was created entirely by Cardiff. Matt Brazier's pathetic back- pass sent the Brighton top-scorer clear, and his low finish was crisp and confident. While Brighton were never again as comfortable as in the opening half-hour, they created a succession of chances early in the second period. Darren Freeman shot straight at Walton from eight yards then, most remarkably, Watson's 56th-minute free-kick found its way through to Andy Crosby at the far post. But the centre-back, needing any kind of contact from three yards, saw the ball bounce between his legs. Cardiff could have punished their hosts' profligacy but Paul Brayson, played in after 63 minutes, finished badly and Mark Cartwright produced a fine save to deny Kevin Evans's 25-yard drive. These things could easily break a friendship. Later this year the Brighton manager, Micky Adams, will be best man at the wedding of his Cardiff counterpart and former assistant Alan Cork. Last night the two went out to dinner, but while Cork's evening may have been spoilt by this bad- tempered defeat - marked by Gavin Gordon's late red card - and the fact he had to foot the bill, both had plenty of success to toast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
