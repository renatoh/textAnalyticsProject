On Thursday, Rishi Sunak banned banks from requesting personal guarantees for emergency loans to small businesses amid criticism of the way a government-backed rescue package was being administered. Smaller enterprises have been offered business interruption loans but it emerged that banks arranging the state-backed borrowing had been seeking personal guarantees, which mean borrowers often have to put their homes on the line. Despite the revisions to the aid programme, some small business owners still feel that it may not be enough. Cleaning services Kim Langley, 30, who runs a cleaning business in Leicestershire is not sure the changes are of much help to her. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a loan and I feel if I applied for one I might struggle to make any profit because I\u2019ll be paying it back,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to keep prices low for our loyal customers so I think it would be difficult.\u201d Langley started the business three years ago and employed four people but now, because of the coronavirus, she has had to let them all go. \u201cI lost 14 customers and so had to cut their hours,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I only have one job left \u2013 cleaning the office of a company that recovers emergency services vehicles. \u201cThe girls asked me about sick pay but I simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay \u00a395 a week with nothing coming in. I spoke to them and said they either finish now and claim what they can from the government, or they can stay on but there may not be a business to come back to. In the end I let them all go. \u201cI\u2019ve paid off all my suppliers and insurance and I\u2019ll pay myself at the end of next month but then that\u2019s it. If it all goes wrong I\u2019ll have to dissolve the company. If I come out the other end I\u2019ll be surprised.\u201d Joinery Brian Wright, who has been running his joinery business in Chatham, Kent, for 20 years, said the lockdown has been a nightmare so far. \u201cAll of our suppliers gradually ground to a halt after the lockdown was announced,\u201d said the 53-year-old. Wright doesn\u2019t believe the latest measures would make a great deal of difference: \u201cThe removal of personal guarantees would help but I\u2019d need to look into the small print. When you\u2019re trading hand to mouth, taking on extra debt is not ideal.\u201d Totally Bespoke Joinery in Chatham specialises in making timber staircases and fitted furniture. It employs four people, specialising in timber staircases and fitted furniture, and Wright has used the government\u2019s furlough scheme, in which employees are temporarily laid off and 80% of their pay is covered by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve furloughed them but can\u2019t top up the extra 20%. I\u2019m just working with the cash I\u2019ve got at hand,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe difficult thing is that I don\u2019t get any help as company director, even though my salary is comparable to what my guys get. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle. I\u2019ve got about \u00a368,000 worth of work sitting on the shop floor because I can\u2019t install them. I\u2019ve deferred all payments for about three months which will just about keep us alive for the same amount of time. I won\u2019t be able to pay my supplier invoices from March so I hope they will be lenient. I\u2019m just trying to make ends meet and this has thrown a spanner in the works \u2013 a big one.\u201d Beauty industry In Newcastle, hair salon owner Maddi Cook thinks the removal of personal guarantees on emergency loans is good but there\u2019s still more to be done. \u201cI know they\u2019re trying to turn noes into yesses but people will still be left out,\u201d said the 31-year-old. \u201cThe people who are really going to suffer are those who are not hugely wealthy. It feels like the same thing is happening again. \u201cI\u2019m not keen on taking out a loan. The big banks will only lend a minimum of \u00a325,000 and that\u2019s too much. I also don\u2019t want to be in debt as we\u2019re not sure what will happen after all of this.\u201d Cook has been running Ritual Salon for five years, which includes leasing out her facilities to hair dressers. \u201cI have two chair renters who pay me a fixed weekly rent,\u201d she said. \u201cMy salon is on a large premises owned by my landlady. She is able to get a \u00a310,000 grant and has said we don\u2019t need to pay rent which is helpful. Since the lockdown I\u2019ve lost my main income. I make a bit of money from my coaching business but that is only a couple of hundred pounds a month. It\u2019s the people like my renters who I worry about \u2013 their income is down by 40% now.\u201d Food and delivery Sajjad Rahman, 38, has been running Taste of India on the Isle of Sheppey which has been in the family for 29 years and can obtain a \u00a310,000 business rates relief grant unveiled in last month\u2019s budget for firms hit by the Coronavirus-related slowdown. \u201cWe\u2019re eligible for the government grant which is helpful,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that we\u2019re a takeaway only business. Most restaurants are 60% sit in and 40% takeaway, but they\u2019ll be lucky if they make another 20% on top of their takeaway services in this climate. \u201cI think removing the personal guarantee is a good move by the government. It shows they\u2019ve realised it wasn\u2019t working. We don\u2019t need a loan at the moment but I think it would help a lot of people in my position move forward if they need to.\u201d Rahman\u2019s takeaway business employs five people and they\u2019ve been just as busy since the lockdown: \u201cNothing has changed much as people have carried on eating. Safety is a big priority when we go out to deliver food \u2013 I\u2019ve invested in medical grade alcohol gel in the shop and kitchen, and everyone wears gloves and masks. I worry though about the restaurant industry as a whole. If the shutdown is longer than three months it would be catastrophic. I don\u2019t know how people will be able to survive. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous but we\u2019ll just ride it out all together. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I wanted to give back to the NHS and have been giving away free meals to all staff. So far we\u2019ve given away more than 80. I regard them as superheroes, putting themselves on the frontline. I think we should respect them as we do soldiers dodging bullets on the front line.\u201d Creative design Stuart Baker, 31, and Simon Petty, 30, operate a creative consultancy and design studio in London and feel the chancellor\u2019s proposals would make things easier for them. \u201cI don\u2019t own any assets but Simon does,\u201d said Baker. \u201cSo not having to put his house up as collateral is a big plus.\u201d Out of Order Design was founded two years ago and Baker and Petty work with four to five freelancers depending on the project. \u201cIt seems quite daunting to apply for a loan, not to mention time-consuming and stressful,\u201d said Baker. \u201cBut if some barriers will be removed then that would help. Our monthly salaries are \u00a31,750 so well below the \u00a32,500 threshold for the grant on the self-employed income support scheme. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any jobs cancelled, just postponed. One is \u00a315,000 for an installation which has been pushed till the end of summer, and another is \u00a35,000. We haven\u2019t paid our rent which was due on Wednesday and we\u2019ve delayed our corporation tax which is \u00a311,000. We\u2019ll be fine for the next few weeks. We\u2019re just working from home as best we can on projects that can come to light after all this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
