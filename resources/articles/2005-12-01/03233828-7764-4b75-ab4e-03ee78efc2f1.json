John Gunther Dean, then US ambassador to India, said he suspected Israel's secret service Mossad of downing Gen Zia's aircraft in an effort to stop Pakistan developing the nuclear bomb. But when he reported these suspicions to Washington, he was accused of being mentally unbalanced and subsequently forced into retirement. Almost 20 years later, Mr Dean, 80, was speaking out in an attempt to tell his side of the story. The circumstances of Gen Zia ul-Haq's death are as contentious as the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy. The military dictator died on August 17 1988, after leaving the town of Bahawalpur, in Punjab province, where he had been watching a trial of American M1 tanks. Moments after Gen Zia's C-130 plane took off it wobbled then plunged to the ground, killing all on board including the US ambassador to Pakistan and a US general. Conspiracy theorists have focused on a crate of mangos placed on board moments before take-off. Some believe it was sprayed with VX, a poison gas, which only a few countries had. Gen Zia had a long list of enemies, all of whom have been blamed for his death over the years. But Israel has received little attention. Mr Dean told the World Policy Journal that it was plausible Mossad had orchestrated an assassination plot, believing Gen Zia's boast that he was only \"a screwdriver's turn away from the bomb\". But when he told his superiors he was removed from his position in Delhi and his career ended. Mr Dean, a Jew who fled Nazi Germany, said he had no proof of Israeli responsibility. General Muhammad Ali Durrani, a retired Zia-era commander, told the journal the Israeli thesis was \"far-fetched\" and blamed the crash on the C-130, which he said had a history of faults."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
