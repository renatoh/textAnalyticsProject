More than a 1,000 expats and holidaymakers queued for hours in central London to answer the two questions the Spanish government said must not be asked: should there be a Catalan state and should it be independent? \u201cI have been insulted for speaking my language in the streets in Madrid. That is extreme but, when you are struggling to have your own culture, you start to wonder if it is your country,\u201d said 17-year-old student Sergi Fayos, who said he intended to answer yes to both questions. He said he believed that an independent Catalonia would be better off economically but that the main driver behind the independence movement was cultural. And that, he said, was the difference between this vote and the Scottish independence referendum. \u201cIf the debate was purely about economics, it would be much easier for the Spanish government to convince us to reject independence,\u201d said Fayos, who is studying biomedical engineering at Imperial College. Guillem Bonavia, 38, who is originally from Barcelona, said: \u201cIt is interesting if you compare the approaches in Spain and in the UK. Cameron told Scotland \u2018you will break my heart if you leave\u2019. In Spain, they just told us you cannot do it. It is probably the result of a younger democracy.\u201d Bonavia, who works as a management consultant in London and said he intended to vote \u2018yes, yes\u2019, added: \u201cthe more [the Spanish government] says no, the more people want to vote. People want to express their opinions by voting.\u201d A planned independence referendum was ruled unconstitutional by a Spanish court but the unofficial, non-binding vote went ahead. Fayos was one of those who queued for hours outside the unofficial embassy on Fleet Street. Arriving at 2pm, he had only made it to the midway point of the queue about four hours later. \u201cI am worried that they will close before the people at the back can vote,\u201d he said. Was he disappointed that the full vote was cancelled? \u201cAbsolutely, but it wasn\u2019t our fault \u2013 they made it illegal. This is about showing that they cannot stop us.\u201d Berta Vidal, 38, who is from Barcelona but lives in London, said she intended to vote yes to a Catalan state, but no to independence. \u201cI love Spain and I want everyone to be together. Every part of Spain needs to have the same money and to share,\u201d she said. She seemed, however, very much in the minority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
