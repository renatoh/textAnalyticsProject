Van Persie left for Fenerbahce for around \u00a34m in July despite the centre-forward starting Van Gaal\u2019s first season in charge as a favourite to replace Nemanja Vidic as United\u2019s captain. Van Gaal chose Wayne Rooney for the role, which caused some surprise. Van Persie endured an indifferent season, scoring only 10 times and he also suffered six separate injuries or illnesses. It is understood the striker was not always the best influence around the squad and that this was a prime factor in the manager\u2019s decision to allow him to leave. Van Gaal said at the time: \u201cIn the end you always have to evaluate which players have contributed to our fourth place, which players a little bit and which players no contribution and then you make decisions. But you make decisions on facts and not on other things. It is a process. It is what we have experienced in the whole season with each other. You have to oversee all the aspects.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
