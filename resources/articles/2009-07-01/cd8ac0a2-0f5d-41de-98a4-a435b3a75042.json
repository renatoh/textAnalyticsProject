In a report we said the London assembly had warned that aspirations to create between 9,000 and 100,000 jobs in the Olympic Park could be at risk without private funding. This was based on information provided in error by the assembly: it was 9,000 to 10,000 jobs (Olympic stadium could become white elephant, report warns, 1 July, page 12). We were wrong to say in an article about a local government ombudsman's ruling on a case of maladministration by the former Cheshire county council that the Cheshire East council said it would co-operate with Chester council and the new Cheshire West authority, created in April, to consider the report.

The statement by Cheshire East council referred to co-operation with Cheshire West and Chester council (Council 'wrote off' girl who never went to secondary school, 1 July, page 10).
