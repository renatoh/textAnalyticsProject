The findings also raise questions about Canada\u2019s ability to make good on its international climate commitments, which partly rely on forests for carbon sequestration. In a report released on Wednesday, the Toronto-based conservation group Wildlands League found that \u201clogging scars\u201d \u2013 the vestigial remains of roads, landings and turnoffs meant to accommodate heavy machinery \u2013 suppress forest regeneration. Because the dirt roads are so heavily compacted, seedlings have little chance of successfully repopulating the area. Using drones to survey the 27 sites in northern Ontario, Trevor Hesselink, a land-use planner and former forestry policy analyst, found that the scars made up anywhere from 10% to nearly 25% of the areas where forests had once been logged. \u201cThe extent of the scarring, and getting on the ground to see the longevity of the suppression effect, surprised me the most,\u201d Hesselink told the Guardian. Wildlands estimates that nearly 650,000 hectares of forest in Ontario \u2013 eight times the area of New York City \u2013 have been lost in last three decades due to scarring. While the province makes up a small part of the country\u2019s overall logging industry, Hesselink and his team believe the long-term damage to forests is probably more common than many realize. The practice of \u201cfull tree harvest\u201d \u2013 where entire trees are cut down and moved to a landing area to be processed \u2013 is also used in western provinces, where the logging industry is more widespread. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told over and over that Canada has a near-zero deforestation rate,\u201d said Janet Sumner, Wildlands League\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t what we were seeing in the bush. So we took a closer look. And now we know.\u201d Canada\u2019s forests have become central to the Liberal goverment\u2019s pledge to fight the climate crisis. As part of his re-election campaign, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to plant 2bn trees in the next decade. Hesselink\u2019s findings also call into question Canada\u2019s calculations of carbon sequestration from its forests. The lost carbon storage could be as high as 41 megatons by 2030 \u2013 or an entire year\u2019s worth of passenger vehicle emissions in Canada. \u201cAs long as these logging scars are suppressing the natural renewal of forest, they\u2019re forgoing carbon that could removed from the atmosphere,\u201d said Hesselink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
