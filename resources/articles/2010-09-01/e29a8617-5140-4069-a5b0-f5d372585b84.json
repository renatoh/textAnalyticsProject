The welfare secretary wants to take all those complex, creaking benefits and merge them into a single, simple system \u2013 a system which he plans to call a universal credit. No matter that Gordon Brown spent 13 years stirring different streams of social security around, usually rebranding them as credits along the way. Mr Duncan Smith is utterly confident that the upshot will be utterly different this time around. And different it will be, at least in one respect. While the Labour government, which presided over more prosperous times, lubricated each new credit with more money than the miserable benefits that were being replaced, today's chancellor is suggesting reforms will have to wipe an extra \u00a34bn off the bill. To be fair to Mr Duncan Smith, he is not tamely accepting that, but instead fighting bravely back against George Osborne, publicly disowning any knowledge of that \u00a34bn figure. His prolonged study of social protection has moved him on from the days when he was an unbending stalwart of the Tory right, and \u2013 together with his Christian convictions \u2013 his research has persuaded him that many of those the old Tories branded \"workshy\" are in fact the victims of a system which conspires to strangle ambition. There is much in this analysis, and particularly in the Duncan Smith conclusion that investment is required now in order to reap bigger savings from the bills of economic failure. The dispossessed and dispirited may well need prompting to consider their options for work, but even that requires costly staff. In addition, they will need training, and in some cases counselling or job subsidies which cost even more \u2013 though still far less than the eventual cost of the alternative of writing people off to a life on benefits. Welfare-to-work is difficult as well as expensive, and only this week a committee of MPs reported on major problems in the implementation of the last administration's grand scheme to reconnect disabled people with the world of work. Mr Duncan Smith might, perhaps, trim the costs somewhat if he can find a way of doing things more smartly. Even then, in the current climate it can be safely said that he will not secure anything like enough upfront cash to fund all the rehabilitation and training that he would like to see. What is more, the coalition seems set on further reductions in benefit rates, over and above the stringent cuts already announced. Unless these are precisely targeted on the better-off \u2013 and the recent failure of nerve over nursery milk suggests they will not be \u2013 they will make the poor poorer in the immediate term. The dubious contention made by the deputy prime minister in yesterday's Times was that by cutting smartly the coalition can reinforce the rusty rungs on the ladder of opportunity. That was certainly not what happened with the first cuts set out in the budget: the red book itself documented that the consequence of these was to land more people in a bind where their benefits are withdrawn at a rate of 90p or more for every pound they earn \u2013 evidence of the poverty trap tightening its clutches. With a new poll yesterday showing that Nick Clegg is more popular with Conservative than Liberal Democrat voters, it must be hoped that his railing against \"giant cheque[s]\" that \"compensate the poor for their predicament\" comes attached to a serious plan for making sure they will be much better rewarded where they work. It will not be easy to devise. Mr Duncan Smith struggles to appreciate that many of the perversities in social security are inherent, because of the tension between providing alms for those with nothing and rewarding efforts to acquire something. The budget showed that swinging the axe at the welfare monster only provokes it to grasp its hostages more tightly. Messrs Clegg and Duncan Smith express their ambition in warm words, but the crunch will come in cold analytical numbers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
