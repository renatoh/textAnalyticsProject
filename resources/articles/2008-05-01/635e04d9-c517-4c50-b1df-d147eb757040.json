It was under these circumstances that I watched a young man who looked a bit like a 90s eco protester Swampy bring a tray of food to his angry-looking wife. Man \"Oh, you got a table then?\" Woman \"Yeah, someone got up and I jumped right in. I don't fuck about. Did you get them wedges?\" Man (putting the tray on the table) \"Nah, they didn't have any.\" Woman (with a sense of furious entitlement) \"Well you're supposed to get money off, or a free thing, or something. You didn't ask for nothing?\" Man (sensing danger) \"No. They didn't have no wedges!\" Woman \"You didn't ask for nothing else, no money off?\" The man shook his head like a condemned prisoner, resigned, but still somehow baffled by his fate. Woman (growing louder, as though sheer volume might underwrite her ham-fisted but fervent grasp of consumer law) \"Well you should have done! You could have sued them, that's false advertising, that is.\" Man \"You want me to go back up? It's rammed.\" Woman \"No point.\" Man \"They didn't have no wedges.\" Woman \"You should have texted me. I could have told you what to do.\" She took a mouthful of processed meat and stared at him as she rolled it around her mouth with a look that said \"because there are no wedges I am not enjoying this at all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
