Running battles broke out in La Paz as Morales supporters, throwing rocks and wielding wooden planks, squared off against riot police who set off teargas into the crowds of demonstrators. Huge crowds also mobilised in the adjacent city of El Alto, demanding his return. Former senate head Adriana Salvatierra, a Morales loyalist who resigned just after he did, was prevented from entering the parliament building by police who scuffled with her supporters. Emboldened Movement For Socialism (MAS) lawmakers and senators, who hold a two-thirds majority, tried to hold sessions to declare A\u00f1ez\u2019s claim to the presidency illegal and block Morales\u2019s resignation. But the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, congratulated A\u00f1ez on claiming the country\u2019s top job: \u201cThe United States applauds Bolivian Senator Jeanine A\u00f1ez for stepping up as interim president of state to lead her nation through this democratic transition, under the constitution of Bolivia and in accordance with the principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\u201d Meanwhile, Morales called for dialogue with his political rivals but repeated his allegation that he was the victim of a coup, as the country\u2019s interim leader pledged to hold new elections as soon as possible. Speaking at a press conference in Mexico City, Morales called for an end to the violence that has racked Bolivia since elections last month plagued with allegations of vote-rigging. \u201cI have a message for the police and the armed forces: don\u2019t stain yourselves with the blood of the people,\u201d he said. At least eight people have been killed in three weeks of clashes across Bolivia. Morales dismissed an Organisation of American States report that found there had been \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the vote which would have handed him his fourth term in office. He saidhis rightwing opponents had plotted the coup from the night of the vote. \u201cThe OAS is not at the service of the people of Latin America. It is at the service of the USA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe built a lot with so much sacrifice and now this coup is destroying Bolivia.\u201d As Morales spoke in exile, A\u00f1ez pledged to hold a new election as soon as possible, calling for a peaceful transition from what she described as a \u201ctotalitarian regime\u201d. In a message to Bolivia\u2019s young people, she tweeted: \u201cGod bless you and allow us to be free and to hold transparent elections soon.\u201d The senate vice-president and a conservative Christian, A\u00f1ez declared herself the country\u2019s interim president late on Tuesday with outsized Bible in her hand \u2013 despite a boycott of the legislative session by lawmakers from Morales\u2019s party. Even as she assumed the role, angry Morales supporters decried her as a racist usurper who had seized power illegally. Ruben Chambi, an MAS lawmaker described her oath of office as a \u201cmedia show\u201d and told supporters that his party would reject Morales\u2019s resignation, \u201cso that he comes back directly and resumes his functions as president\u201d. Morales resigned on Sunday after a tumultuous 48 hours in which police officers mutinied, the OAS said it could not verify his first-round victory and the military command urged him him to quit. He flew into exile in Mexico on Tuesday. Bolivia\u2019s constitutional court has said that after the resignations of Morales, his deputy and the presidents of the senate and chamber of deputies, A\u00f1ez was next in line to assume the presidency. With no one to swear her in, she took power noting that the constitution did not require congressional approval. But in the streets of La Paz, hundreds of Morales supporters waved the multi-coloured Wiphala, the flag of native people of the Andes associated with Morales\u2019 government, shouting: \u201cShe must quit!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s declared herself president without having a quorum in the parliament,\u201d said one protester, Julio Chipana. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t represent us.\u201d Others swore their enduring loyalty to Morales, the country\u2019s first indigenous leader in modern times. \u201cWhile our president and maximum leader Evo Morales is alive, the MAS will carry on,\u201d said the party youth leader Alejandro Mart\u00ednez. \u201cHe may not come back tomorrow, or the day after, but that won\u2019t stop us from taking the streets.\u201d A\u00f1ez cuts a starkly contrasting figure with Morales. Entering the parliament building on Tuesday night, she brandished an outsized bible, in an explicit rebuke to Morales, who banned the Christian holy book from the presidential palace when he reformed the constitution in 2009 to recognize Pachamama, the Andean Mother Earth deity, instead of the Catholic church. \u201cMy commitment is to return democracy and tranquility to the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can never again steal our vote.\u201d Afterwards, she greeted supporters from the balcony of the old Casa Quemado presidential palace rather than the 26-storey Casa del Pueblo skyscraper built by Morales, which opponents saw as an example of his excesses. Her sudden move to the political centre stage prompted a closer look at racist remarks towards Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority on her social media accounts. One tweet from 2013 \u2013 later deleted \u2013 describes indigenous Aymara new year\u2019s celebrations as \u201csatanic\u201d and concludes: \u201cNobody can replace God!\u201d In another post, she questioned whether a group of indigenous people were genuine because they were wearing shoes. Yerko Ihlik, a Bolivian political commentator, downplayed her potential to further polarize the country. \u201cThe [interim] president has one mandate and that mandate is to call new elections as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constitution allows 90 days but the country\u2019s situation demands that they are sooner.\u201d But in a clear sign that she intends to steer the country away from the socialism of her predecessor, one of A\u00f1ez\u2019s first acts on Wednesday was to recognise the opposition leader Juan Guiad\u00f3 as president of Venezuela \u2013 overturning Bolivia\u2019s support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro under Morales. The US and Brazil were quick to offer their congratulations to A\u00f1ez. \u201cWe look forward to working with her and Bolivia\u2019s other civilian authorities as they arrange free and fair elections as soon as possible,\u201d tweeted Michael Kozak, US assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs. The UK and the US warned their citizens to avoid travel to Bolivia, with the US ordering the departure of diplomatic family members and non-emergency US government employees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
