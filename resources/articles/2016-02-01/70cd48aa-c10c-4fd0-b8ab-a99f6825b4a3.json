Yaya Tour\u00e9 may not have the overwhelming, devastating presence of seasons past but on the grand stage, when it still fancies him, he remains a vital cog in Manchester City\u2019s machine. Like so many midfielders approaching the latter days of their career, the 32-year-old\u2019s role is changing, slowly retreating deeper and deeper. Whether Tour\u00e9 2.0, a concept that remains very much in a beta stage, can be as effective as the barnstorming player of old remains to be seen. He is still guilty of the occasional lapse in concentration, displayed by the gilt-edged header spurned in the closing minutes, even if his last-minute curler capped an impressive City performance. There were elements of the old Tour\u00e9 as well as the new and the delicious manner in which he whipped in that left-foot finish to give Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team a deserved two-goal cushion was just reward for an overall fine performance. His future in Manchester remains uncertain but he provided more than enough evidence here, making his 80th appearance ina Uefa club tournament in the country where he received his first taste of European competition at Metalurg Donetsk, to prove he is not a spent force just yet. When the team sheets landed an hour before kick-off, Tour\u00e9 looked likely to start at No10 but instead occupied a holding role next to Fernando with Fernandinho deployed on the right and David Silva behind Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Tour\u00e9 won the 2009 Champions League with Barcelona as a centre-half. City have used him most often in central midfield with spasmodic forays into a more attacking role. It says much for his brilliant career that it is impossible to define in which of those three he appears more distinguished. The Ivorian has so often looked languid but, with his right leg heavily strapped, his movement was only marginally more than a hobble at times. It did not need to be; Dynamo Kyiv were anaemic in a shoddy first\u2011half performance, displaying all the enervating effects of 77 days without competitive action. When the hosts woke from their slumber and put pressure on in the second half, Tour\u00e9 showed brief moments of doziness. He perhaps also deserved a smidgen of criticism for the slow-motion reaction on the edge of the area in the buildup to Vitaliy Buyalskyi\u2019s goal. But do not let the scarcity of sprinting cloud his ability to make a decisive contribution. He trundled off with only one misplaced pass, coming in injury time, and, strikingly, showed a defensive discipline that has so often been lacking. There was a moment late in the first half when Fernando strode forward to join an attack. Tour\u00e9 immediately fell back into a position to anticipate any break. A small thing, perhaps, but nonetheless notable considering his past distaste for putting in thankless work. Twenty minutes from time he broke into a rare scuttle to make a crucial tackle as Dynamo counterattacked. How often has he been pulled up on his defensive work ethic? He still possesses a deftness and speed of thought that belies that weakened physical output. He was on hand to head down for Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s sublime opener, making it a superlative 16 from 17 in the Champions League for the Argentinian striker, and from then on Tour\u00e9 offered a controlling presence that has so often been absent. It seems wrong to intimate Tour\u00e9\u2019s future \u2013 or perhaps lack of \u2013 at City when Pep Guardiola takes over in the summer is the prime cause of his supposed recent discernible lack of interest. His highly charged, box-to-box performances had disappeared well before that announcement, even if suggestions he has picked up a white flag persist. Could it not be argued that he is merely past a stage when he can run harder, faster, stronger than anybody else? Is he aware that those long legs can no longer gallop at defences with the ferocity of old? Conscious he no longer possesses the power that has terrorised defences? There are still glimpses of his attacking gifts: a stunning free-kick here, a ruthless filleting of an opposing defence there. But the short-term view we can all be guilty of having as fans means after we become accustomed to seeing a player perform to such an exceptional level on a weekly basis, when they slow down and are no longer capable of producing it they are more susceptible to harsh criticism. While his perceived descent from eminent force to run-of-the-mill might seem like an overnight sensation, the numbers indicate a more gradual climbdown from his 2013-14 peak. After scoring 20 goals for City during that title-winning season, he managed only 10 in 2014-15. Against Kyiv he scored his sixth of this campaign. It all adds to the theory of him being moulded into a deeper role. There were prolonged questions directed at Brendan Rodgers when Steven Gerrard was initially perched in front of Liverpool\u2019s back four \u2013 he was robbed of his freedom, the team\u2019s creativity would suffer with the star player unable to get forward as much \u2013 but Gerrard still made an impressive impact on games. Can Tour\u00e9 start doing the same at City?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
