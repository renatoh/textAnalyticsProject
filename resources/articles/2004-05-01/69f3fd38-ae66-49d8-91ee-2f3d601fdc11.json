Most organisations of any substantial size will offer some sort of induction day, and these come in a variety of forms. Paul Armstrong, of human resources consultancy Penna, says the term 'induction' is a little old-fashioned: \"It sounds like you put electrodes on someone's temples and zap them,\" he comments. \"A much more modern word is orientation; rather than remove everything the inductee knew before they joined, the idea is to build on the skills and potential they're bringing into the organisation.\" Call it what you want, there are ways of making the most of your introduction to your new environment. 1. See whether you can have any input Check during your interview what the day is likely to include. Many modern organisations welcome such input and will be happy to do their best to ensure the day, or days, live up to your expectations as well as theirs. 2. Talk to previous inductees Find out whether the day is any more than lipservice. Penna has experience of clients offering what sound like excellent days of orientation into a business and its culture, only to have job starters come back and complain that it was more like a brainwashing session. And if your new employer is getting it wrong, it's worth telling them about it - it won't improve if they don't know. 3. Don't be afraid to participate and feed back. The best days are interactive rather than a monologue, and it's your chance to make your first impression and to get what you want out of the event. 4. Look for companies offering content Dawn Harnetty is now in public relations but recalls her initial two-days with market analyst Datamonitor extremely well. \"I received presentation training which wasn't something I required at the time but that has helped me enormously in my PR career,\" she says. \"Graduates should stay open-minded about the range of skills they might need long-term and make the most of training on offer.\" 5. Is it the be-all and end-all? Paul Armstrong points to organisations that offer six-monthly meetings for new joiners rather than a single event. Obviously this offers more depth than a one-off. 6. Find out how long it lasts Dawn Harnetty's impression is that a single morning, as some firms will offer, is likely to end up as a quick introduction to everybody and getting shown where the kitchen is. Look for organisations that want to invest their time in you and evidence that they're doing so usefully. 7. Meet the people you're working with Trainee PR executive Rachel Hodson had to do a presentation about her company as part of the interview, but this meant that during induction she had the right \"hooks'\" on which to hang the more salient information that was given to her. She also stresses the importance of taking notes on this information and not being afraid to ask questions - if you're in the induction or orientation process you're no longer being tested; people don't mind you not knowing stuff. 8. Don't panic. There will be huge amounts of information to take in about the company, your role in it, IT, people's names, client information - assume you won't take it all in at first and understand that nobody expects you to. Aim for a flavour of what's going on rather than detail and you're more likely to succeed. 9. Recognise your value as a beginner You don't have the baggage of working for the company for a long time and with luck this will give you a fresh perspective. This works well for the company as well if they do it properly, suggests Paul Armstrong. \"What better opportunity than getting inductees working on some burning issues, probably sponsored by someone senior - they come in with fresh eyes, they're not carrying all the internal 'we've always done it this way' stuff.\" This works best if induction is done over months rather than days. 10. Find out what your company expects Is there a named sponsor inside the organisation for your induction group? Will there be some sort of buddying or mentoring scheme for you while you get the hang of the job and your new workplace? The more thought that has gone into the event, the more both you and your new employer are likely to get out of it. \u00b7guy@clapperton.co.uk &gt;"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
