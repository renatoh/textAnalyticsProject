The inaugural awards, organised by Monotype, recognise and celebrate brands that are committed to excellence in design and typography. The winners are selected by a panel of global brand experts who assess the role of typography in building messages, marketing and advertising efforts and overall customer experiences. The Guardian was one of several brands that were selected as a Type Champion. The Type Champion Awards concluded: \u2018During a time when publishers face increasing scrutiny, The Guardian continues to prove its staying power and its rightful recognition from the Type Champions committee\u2019. The award win follows the launch of the Guardian\u2019s most-recent brand campaign, \u2018Hope Is Power\u2019 that restates the Guardian\u2019s purpose and strives to inspire readers around the world to support its journalism."}, "isHosted": false}}}
