Draped in EU flags and carrying homemade placards lampooning Ukip leader Nigel Farage and prominent leave campaigner Boris Johnson, a large number of people were still gathered in front of Parliament Square as darkness fell after making their way down there following an earlier protest in Trafalgar Square. In between chants of \u201cvote it down\u201d and \u201cno more lies\u201d, crowds listened to speakers call for the referendum result to be challenged or pushed aside, describing it as not legally binding. Typical of many there was Laura Clarke, 23, who said that she was now beginning to feel a sense of \u201chope\u201d after what she described as last week\u2019s \u201cdevastation\u201d. \u201cI felt like my future had been taken away and then I have been angry for most of the weekend,\u201d said Clarke, carrying an umbrella in the rain and with her cheek daubed in the blue and yellow of the EU flag. Clarke, a native of Wales now living and working in London after recently graduating, added: \u201cSo it was just really nice to come here and feel united. I\u2019ve been feeling solidarity with other people here and also, basically, just the love as well.\u201d Heather Gordon, 31, and her friend Jenny Myatt, 32, painted their faces with the EU\u2019s gold stars on a blue background and wrapped themselves in flags for the protest. Speaking outside parliament Gordon said: \u201cWe are here because we have to be here. We are here because our country hasn\u2019t really spoken for us.\u201d She joked: \u201cIf we had another referendum, it would work in everyone\u2019s favour, including my own \u2013 because I love tapas.\u201d Myatt said: \u201cI think if you had a referendum today the outcome would be very different.\u201d Politicians were largely absent, although the pro-Remain Tory MP Anna Soubry was cheered as she told the crowds: \u201cIf you hear of anyone who has been abused because of their race or the colour of their skin, tell your MP and report it to the police. Fight back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
