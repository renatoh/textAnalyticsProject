There was no champagne on New Year's Eve, no glass of red wine with Sunday lunch, no shots of ouzo on holiday in Greece. Each of these potential drinks would have been lovely, in its own way; but none of them is worth the feeling of sick horror, guilt, fear and remorse to which I would so frequently wake up in my drinking days. A few months ago, as I listened to the wonderful Molly Parkin describe on Desert Island Discs, the morning she found herself in an east London gutter, hearing her grandmother's voice in her head saying \"Molly, you've had your last drink\", I was grateful that I sobered up when I did. Parkin was 55 when she had her epiphany, and admitted that she is still trying to make it up to her children for the years of humiliation and disorder she bought to their lives. Thank God I'm only 43, I thought. Thank God I stopped before I did my children any permanent harm. Thank God I got out of a marriage in which alcohol had always been the third party, from our early drinking buddy days to the end, when booze made being together bearable. Is it possible to hold down a job and a relationship, bring up two children and stay more or less on the rails, while still drinking at least a bottle of white wine every night and often much more at the weekends? Why yes \u2013 I did it for years and could probably have gone on doing it too. True, I would been prematurely raddled, have felt it was an achievement simply to keep my head above water, and have run the risk that my alcoholism would progress from high-functioning to malfunctioning. But worst of all, I would have set my children a repeated, corrosive example \u2013 that the way adults deal with stress, pain, boredom and loneliness is to dissolve them in alcohol. I was too busy drinking to examine my drinking. Alongside the nightly consumption there were the hangovers, the depression, the nameless dread, the suspicion, so terrifying I'd push it away, that I might have to do more than cut down, or have days off, or spend January detoxing. Drinking as much as I did produces a permanent poisonous miasma in which it is near impossible to get clarity on anything, least of all the damage you are causing your children and yourself. Twin studies show that alcoholism is heritable, and booze is certainly in my nature. One of my grandfathers, both of my grandmothers and an aunt were alcoholics, and my parents each regained control over their incipient drink problems by an effort of will. But it was nurtured too. Glasses of sherry at midday before lunch, giant gin and tonics before dinner, wine every night and vodka martinis offered as solace when I was a broken-hearted teenager were all considered perfectly normal. I can't help with the genes I've passed on to my children, now 12 and nine, but I can show them that, for most people in the UK, drinking every day is very far from normal (a 2008 survey reveals that only 15% of the population drank on five or more days in the week surveyed). I first got drunk at 14 and loved the feeling; I was invulnerable, desensitised, fearless and disinhibited. At university and in my 20s I drank heroically and often catastrophically, but it didn't occur to me that my drinking might be a problem. Back then, alcohol was fun \u2013 sort of. The boyfriend who would later become my husband used to enjoy cooking for me, and we would sit in his kitchen and put away bottle after bottle of wine, often drinking all afternoon and into the evening. After weekends like this I would go into work looking and feeling like death warmed up. What we'd talked about and the sex we'd had was blurry, but I'd found someone who wanted to get as drunk as me and, lubricated by white wine, I chose to gloss over our intellectual and sexual incompatibility. Apart from when I was pregnant, I don't think my ex and I can have spent more than a handful of nights sober together in 12 years of marriage. Depending on his frame of mind, it was not unusual for me to come downstairs in the middle of the night to find him slumped over the kitchen table, television blaring, another empty bottle in front of him. Yet facing the seriousness of his problem would have also involved looking at mine, and life without alcohol was unthinkable; even when I was detoxing or dieting, my next drink was somewhere at the back of my mind. I left my husband because I fell in love with someone else, not because of his drinking. But looking back, I don't think I would ever have been able to stop if I'd stayed with him. I wish I could say my rock bottom came when I really understood what I was doing to the kids. Instead, it arrived when the black cloud of Icelandic ash settled over Gatwick last year \u2013 and my carefully laid plans to visit my boyfriend in France. When I found myself without partner, children, friends or any idea how I was going to spend the four empty days stretching ahead of me, my desire to get drunk was so powerful that the only way I could resist it was to physically remove myself from the house. Anywhere would do, just so long as I could distract myself until the witching hour of 6pm, when I could open a bottle of wine and obliterate my misery, loneliness and (paradoxically) an inescapable conclusion about myself \u2013 that, as the saying goes, \"If your drinking causes a problem, it is a problem\". Over the weekend I talked to a dear friend who had recently sobered up, and before I could change my mind about it, emailed my boyfriend telling him about my decision. A year on, it's one of the best I've ever made. I'm the recipient of unexpected and undeserved grace in another way too. When I hesitatingly told my daughter that I'd stopped altogether because I used to drink too much, she said wonderingly, \"Did you? I never noticed.\" Polly Sykes is a pseudonym"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
