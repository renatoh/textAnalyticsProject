That said, Walken shimmying to Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You with a pool cue for a dance partner comes a close second. 9 Silver Linings Playbook Strictly Ballroom would be a more obvious choice to represent the \u201cklutzy-pupil-shines-thanks to-hunky-instructor\u201d category, but this celebration of mediocrity is irresistible. Tiffany (J-Law) is half-drunk before Pat (Bradley Cooper) drags her on to the competition floor, so it\u2019s no wonder her graceful leap ends in an awkward face-hump. 8 It\u2019s a Wonderful Life George (James Stewart) and his future wife Mary (Donna Reed) are dancing the Charleston at a graduation party when everyone else comes to a standstill. The couple assume they\u2019ve got an audience when, in fact, the mechanised gym floor is slowly opening up beneath them. They fall right into the swimming pool below, but no amount of chlorinated water can dampen the high spirits of youth. 7 Romy and Michele\u2019s High School Reunion As their high school reunion approaches, Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) begin to worry that their snooty classmates will judge them failures. The solution? An interpretive dance routine to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Time After Time, obviously. 6 Trainspotting Cinema has rarely done justice to the sweaty-faced rave scene. Then Renton had a dancefloor epiphany that seemed to sum up the past, present and future of British club culture in one: \u201cMusic is changing, drugs are changing, even men and women are changing. One thousand years from now there\u2019ll be no guys and no girls; just wankers.\u201d 5 Pulp Fiction It was hyped as John Travolta\u2019s big comeback, but his entry into \u201cthe world-famous, Jack Rabbit Slim\u2019s twist contest!\u201d stands on its own merits. Namely, a po-faced, bare-footin\u2019 Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), the threat of mobster violence hanging in the air and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s direction at its Godard-homaging best. 4 Saturday Night Fever Travolta pops up frequently in any movie dance list, and with good reason: the man can move. In this gritty portrait of 70s Brooklyn, he plays the strobe-lit stallion of Odyssey nightclub and spends much of the movie strutting his stuff. It\u2019s his More Than a Woman routine that lives on, however. Technically he\u2019s dancing with a partner, but as that blindingly white three-piece makes clear, Tony is always the prima don. 3 House Party The typical movie dance-off ends in someone screaming: \u201cSee you at regionals, bitches!\u201d, but not in the good-natured, primary-coloured cult classic House Party. When Kid \u2019n\u2019 Play engage in a flirtatious dance battle everyone comes out smiling. Ain\u2019t My Type of Hype by Full Force is the ridiculously funky new jack swing track that they get down to and, yes, you will be needing it on your next house party playlist. 2 Top Hat This is the transporting cloud of loveliness on which Astaire and Rogers\u2019s enduring reputation floats. The couple begin their Cheek to Cheek routine as mortal enemies and end as starry-eyed lovers, with Fred Astaire softly crooning Irving Berlin\u2019s lyrics into Ginger Rogers\u2019s ear throughout: \u201cHeaven, I\u2019m in heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak \u2026\u201d Know the feeling? 1 Call Me By Your Name The Psychedelic Furs\u2019 Love My Way plays at an Italian outdoor disco and Armie Hammer lets go: eyes closed, Converse shuffling side to side, fingers clicking to no discernible rhythm. It\u2019s a purely joyful sight to behold in isolation but the context increases our joy. This is both the moment when young Elio (Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet) falls for the American and when audiences fell for this sun-kissed romance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
