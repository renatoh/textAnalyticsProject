In a sharply worded report, the MPs recognised the \"positive aspects of bingo clubs\" as social centres and called for a relaxation of rules governing private lotteries, football pools - where 5,000 jobs have been lost - and other forms of gambling hit by the \u00a35bn a year success of the National Lottery. They also condemned all sides in the battle over the lottery franchise and urged the government to break the lottery up among different organisations to prevent it becoming \"a perpetual private monopoly\". Nor should the BBC be allowed to broadcast all lottery draws in future, it said. However, the committeee praised Lord Burns, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, who was brought in to run the beleaguered lottery commission last year after Dame Helena Shovelton resigned amid a welter of criticism. \"We do not consider the commission to have had the relevant skills or expertise prior to the appointment of Lord Burns. The government was fortunate that someone of his quality was available,\" said the committee, chaired by Labour's Gerald Kaufman. The MPs also noted the change of tone adopted by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, between August 2000 when he praised the exclusion of Camelot, the current franchise holders, and December when, after legal action, they were restored to the bidding alongside the People's Lottery consortium, led by Sir Richard Branson. The committee urged ministers to consider \"the financial and cost implications of a not-for-profit operator\" like the People's Lottery so that clear guidance can be in place next time the franchise is open to bids, in 2008."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
