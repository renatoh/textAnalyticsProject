The type of person Labour would like for the role is said to be a combination of television presenters such as Anne Robinson, Nicky Campbell and Mary Portas, yet with the gravitas of MP Margaret Hodge, who has been targeting tax avoidance on her public accounts select committee. It is estimated that consumers are losing around \u00a33.3bn every year to companies through misleading and aggressive sales practices alone. A media-friendly ombudsman will be asked to act as the public face for consumer protection, appearing on television to educate consumers about how to fight for their rights, while also having the powers to take up class actions on behalf of consumers against companies or the government. Labour is also looking at establishing a dedicated consumer affairs minister based in the business, energy and environment departments. The shadow minister driving the plan, Gareth Thomas MP, will launch the idea this weekend in his role as chairman of the Co-operative party, a division within the Labour party. The policy was first mooted in 2009 by the Labour government but did not come to pass. Critics point out that there are already plenty of public bodies to help consumers, from trading standards offices to Directgov. But Thomas said he believes that creating an independent ombusman with class-action powers and a responsibility to highlight consumer concerns to parliament would make it easier for people to claim compensation if they were affected by issues such as payment protection (PPI); hidden fees for pensions, savings and credit cards; energy price increases; the PIP breast implant scandal; excessive bank charges; and airline charges that are not disclosed upfront. Thomas said the impact of such problems on consumers had been compounded by the usually very slow response, poor complaints-handling and inadequate redress from the offending companies. He said: \"If markets are to be fair and to work for everybody, then consumers need to be properly protected from poor service and ripoff behaviour. An independent ombudsman and stronger ministerial interest will help to enforce the standards all of us as consumers should have a right to expect. \"A number of other countries already have a strong consumer ombudsman able to take action against poor treatment of customers. It's time Britain caught up with best practice overseas.\" The plan is the latest attempt by Labour to put itself on the side of the consumer in the public mind, following Ed Miliband's announcement that he would freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour wins the next election. Prime minister David Cameron is expected to fight back with a series of announcements from next month, including cuts to the cost of rail commuters' season tickets and a curb on bank fees. After his speech at the Tory party conference last week in Manchester, Labour said Cameron was failing to address the \"cost-of-living crisis\" and offered a land of opportunity \"for just a privileged few\". During the 50-minute speech, Cameron had contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: \"If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business.\" He added: \"It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras \u2013 Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
