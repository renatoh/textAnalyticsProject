Announcing the service on Monday, the Welsh government said the new system \u2013 the first of its kind in the UK \u2013 would allow teams of NHS doctors to swiftly reach an injured or sick patient in the most remote areas. The Labour-led government said it had looked at civilian flying doctor services around the world and worked with military medical experts to design the system, called the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service Cymru (EMRTS Cymru). It estimates EMRTS Cymru could contribute to at least a 40% improvement in survival rates from major trauma in Wales and could reduce transfer times to specialist hospital care by more than 40%. The introduction of the new service, which will serve all Wales, will mean 95% of the population will be able to access doctor-led care within 30 minutes. Deputy minister for health, Vaughan Gething, said: \u201cThis new service will transform our ability to provide the very best care to the most critically ill patients in Wales. It will provide patients in remote and rural areas of Wales with rapid access to the skills of a consultant in emergency or intensive care medicine, who are equipped to provide life-saving, specialist critical care.\u201d At the moment air ambulance services in the UK are provided by charities. From April, the EMRTS Cymru service will work with the Wales Air Ambulance charity, using its existing three helicopter ambulances. The government will provide a team of NHS doctors from emergency medicine, anaesthesia and intensive care and critical care NHS paramedics to help staff the charity\u2019s air ambulances. The Welsh government has earmarked capital funding of almost \u00a32m in 2014-15 to set up the service, and from 2015-16 will provide almost \u00a33m a year to support it. Angela Hughes, chief executive of Wales Air Ambulance, said: \u201cTo secure NHS consultants on board our flights is a remarkable leap forward in providing one of the most advanced air ambulance services in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
