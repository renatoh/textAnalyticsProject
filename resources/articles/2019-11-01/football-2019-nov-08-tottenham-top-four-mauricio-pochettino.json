The manager goes into Saturday\u2019s home game against Sheffield United with his team in 11th place, having taken 13 points from 11 games and with question marks over whether a clutch of players are to remain a part of his long-term plans. In early November 2014, when Pochettino went to Aston Villa for a league fixture, Spurs were 14th, with 11 points from the Argentinian\u2019s first nine league matches, and a lineup that included plenty of players he would move on. Pochettino is on record as saying that had Spurs lost he would have been gone. They won 2-1, thanks to a last-gasp Harry Kane goal, which Pochettino credits as being the turning point for him at the club. Spurs won 4-0 at Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Wednesday, moving them to within touching distance of the last 16, but they have struggled to generate momentum on the domestic front. Pochettino is determined to get back to winning ways on Saturday but he warned that Spurs need time to get it right. \u201cWe went back to five years ago where we were like this in terms of position, situations and stuff like that, so it takes time,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe cannot move the club forward quick, we cannot accelerate the time \u2013 that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s a natural process. We only need to stay calm and work hard because there is not another way to change this dynamic. It\u2019s different to five years ago but with a lot of similarities.\u201d Pochettino was asked to discuss the similarities. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to talk now because I don\u2019t want to be talking about negative things,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise you if all goes well, I will explain for you. I want to be positive because the signals in the last few weeks have been positive.\u201d Spurs trail fourth-placed Chelsea by 10 points but Pochettino believes a Champions League finish remains possible. \u201cWhen you assess all the circumstances, it\u2019s normal to be in the position we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see [about the top four]. Today, it\u2019s so early. If we are capable of finding the right balance to start performing in the way we expect, it\u2019s still possible.\u201d Hugo Lloris\u2019s return from an elbow injury is expected to be delayed by a couple of weeks after he had surgery. The goalkeeper dislocated the joint and damaged ligaments at Brighton on 5 October and it was hoped he could recover without an operation. Further reviews found the elbow remained unstable. It is now hoped Lloris will return in February. Pochettino\u2019s assistant, Jesus P\u00e9rez, said. \u201cThey needed to repair some things in his elbow and that\u2019s why it may take a little bit longer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
