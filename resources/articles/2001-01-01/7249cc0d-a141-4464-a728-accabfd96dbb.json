They can be a problem in low-lying swampy areas and some valleys, but you hardly encounter them at all near the ice and in the north-west. But get it wrong and they are trouble. On my first trip to the south, I only took a Deet repellent and they bit through my long socks. On the next visit, I made sure I wore long trousers (loose enough to roll up when crossing streams), and I took a head net that fitted over a hat, but I only needed it occasionally. I also took a bottle of stronger-formula Deet (it seems to be available in three strengths) for my wrists and for the odd occasions when they got inside the hut or tent. A bed net was not necessary. I also took antihistamine tablets; they don't stop the bites but considerably lessen their severity. Triludan may no longer be easily available, but Piriton works almost as well. Neale Taylor The best and most effective product is a Deet-free moisturiser made by a company called Alfresco. I spent three weeks in Antigua this year with my six-month-old son and, not wanting to use chemical repellents, tried Alfresco. It was 100% effective. You have to apply it quite generously, and I used up two 200ml bottles between me, my partner and my son. I normally order online at www.alfresco.uk.com Sharon Lake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
