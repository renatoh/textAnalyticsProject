Depending on how the post-election bargaining develops, this election could actually go down as the first time in Pakistan's 60 year history when a peaceful transition of political power occurred. Not that Pakistan's elections on Monday were without violence - more than a dozen people were killed in incidents linked to the elections. But in a country that has seen a sharp increase in terrorist attacks and growing political animosity, with several dozen killed in single terrorist incidents in recent months, election day was surprisingly calm in most parts of the country, and Pakistanis the day after the election seem to be breathing a collective sigh of relief. Concerns about attacks contributed to abysmally low voter turnout in certain parts of the country, including the North-West Frontier provinces. But at polling sites throughout the country, turnout seemed to increase in certain areas as the day continued without any major incidents. Electoral authorities have not yet released official tallies, but the party most closely aligned with President Musharraf has already conceded defeat. A spokesman for the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, Tariq Azeem, said that the \"voters have delivered their verdict, and as democrats we accept their verdict.\" That's the main storyline for this election - the reigning political powers in Pakistan have conceded defeat - a truly unprecedented event. The questions that lie ahead include whether the losers will remain gracious and accept their political defeat, and whether the winners will look to the future and use their new political power to tackle Pakistan's considerable problems, or whether they will look to the past and use their new power to settle old scores. That's not such an easy choice in a country whose history is replete with political murders and exiles, as well as violent power grabs and coups. Many of the leaders who appear to have come out on top in the February 2008 elections in Pakistan know already know what political power feels like, and many have them haven't used it so judiciously in previous decades. Basking in the immediate aftermath of an election that could have gone wrong in so many ways but appears to have not, one might be excused for harbouring a reverie or two that February 18, 2008 will go down in Pakistan's history books as a turning point towards a brighter future - when millions of Pakistanis turned out to reject authoritarian rule as well as terrorists and extremists. Not all was perfect on the sunny election day in Pakistan - some women were unfairly turned away by bigoted religious fanatics, and other enthusiastic voters showed up at the polls only to find that their names were not on the voter registry, barring them for voting. Many Pakistanis simply stayed home, either out of fear of more violent attacks or out of conviction that a broken political system was not capable of delivering basic needs and basic freedoms. Some simply showed up at the polls because of their ties to key leaders in certain parties. On the bright side, millions of Pakistanis on Monday took a leap of faith that a new leadership could make a break from Pakistan's past - and not just the immediate past that saw an increasingly authoritarian Musharraf grow out of touch with his own people. If the Pakistanis who showed up at the polls earlier this week had one thing in common in this increasingly fragmented country, it is the belief that perhaps their leaders can change the course of their country, and that they should have a say in shaping that change. At a polling station in Pakistan's capital city on Monday, one man told me that he cast his ballot because he was simply tired of the way things were run in his country, and that he wanted a change. He wasn't confident that his vote would matter or that the new batch of leaders would deliver. But he felt it was important enough to disregard the security threats and throw aside his own cynicism about politics in an effort to do something about the situation in his country. Millions of other Pakistanis took a leap of faith in Monday's election, and soon the ball will be in the court of those who put their names as candidates on the ballot and won power. In the days and weeks ahead, Pakistan's newly-elected leaders will settle into tough and perhaps protracted negotiations about forming a new government. How they conduct these negotiations will either make or break the country. Millions of Pakistanis took a leap of faith that their votes on election day might matter, and the time is fast approaching for the country's leaders to prove that they will honor the votes they received by working with others to tackle Pakistan's considerable problems today, rather than getting caught up in the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
