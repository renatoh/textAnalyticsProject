I understand, vaguely, that some people send each other videos over their mobiles, or chat to each via webcams, but it's all far too advanced for me. Besides, who wants to lug around a phone that is the volume and weight of an encyclopaedia in order to watch 14 seconds of wobbly footage of your mate Dave down the pub? So, email it is. Or was. Call me an old-fashioned type, but I've just rediscovered the joy of talking on the telephone - and on proper landlines at that. I know! Quaint, eh? But why the conversion? Well, for one thing, I've managed to go a record-breaking three weeks without biting my formerly chewed-to-stumps nails, and for the first time in my life actually have talons to be proud of. I'm so terrified of breaking them on my keyboard that email has become an ordeal. Also, they make a horrible clicking noise on the keys, which makes me want to, well, bite them off again. In addition, talking is easy. You don't have to remember how to spell, or spend half an hour looking for the euro sign on your keyboard (which will be turned into gibberish by the time it gets there, so your carefully considered economic analysis is pretty much a bust). You can make jokes on the phone without worrying that the person who reads the mail does not understand that it's a joke. And you don't have to use the horrendous acronym \"lol\" (laughs out loud, for those of you who are blessedly unenlightened) which makes me want to \"pmfttm\" (put my fist through the monitor). On the phone, people know you're joking, because you're laughing. And forget about net dating. There is no better medium for flirting than the phone. Rather than hunching over the computer, you can lean back in your office chair (bad for your back, very non-health'n'safety, but who cares? Not me! And I'm the health'n'safety officer!), dangling your kitten heel off your foot, twisting the cord round your finger and loading every sentence with innuendo and double-meaning. Ordering a hole punch on the internet offers none of these simple pleasures. In fact, it's all been so much fun I'm considering doing a full U-turn on the technological superhighway. I'm thinking of writing some letters, sending the odd telegram, training some carrier pigeons and finding a few messenger boys. Especially the messenger boys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
