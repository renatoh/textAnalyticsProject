By linking trees to climate change, we have established a new source of finance for forestry, which complements rather than competes with other sources of funding. Our planting partners accept and appreciate this. Your article quoted a figure of 45p for every \u00a38.51 invested into tree planting. This is not correct. Our pricing to the public for tree dedications starts at zero (in return for recycling a mobile phone). Future Forests does not get grants or tax incentives. The way our income is split is made clear on our website (futureforests.com) and it is as follows: 25-30% goes directly to the offset project, whether climate-friendly technology or sustainable forestry; a further 25% is put into educational campaigns; 10-15% goes to the sourcing, monitoring, verification and public access of all Future Forests projects; 5-10% goes to sourcing projects; and the remaining 25-30% covers our running costs. Future Forests belongs to a new generation of good businesses trying to do good business. The profit we aim to make in the long term (we are not currently in profit and we don't expect to see any for the next 12 months) will be properly and appropriately earned on the back of positive, environmental outcomes. We make no apology for our business model. The old paradigms - business bad, profit equals exploitation - can and will only be replaced by new value-driven business models such as pursued by Future Forests. Jonathan Shopley CEO, Future Forests Trees do become a carbon repository as they grow, but also have a habit of fading away as saplings, and eventually dying or being chopped down, which puts their carbon straight back into the atmosphere. Planting trees to absorb CO2 is plainly the refuge of the environmentally confused and bewildered, which explains its popularity with pop stars - they would be the same worldwide touring pop stars flying from gig to gig in private jets. Planting trees to offset carbon emissions is simply a way to carry on business as usual with your conscience salved by a kind of 21st- century \"green\" Papal indulgence. Jeffrey Gazzard AirportWatch Like other green groups, the Liberal Democrats had doubts about the Future Forests scheme, which is why we chose not to get involved. It is vital that carbon neutral schemes do actually deliver, and that money donated to plant trees is spent on planting trees. I announced at the recent Liberal Democrat conference that all our future party conferences would be carbon neutral - but we will do it in a way that delivers. Norman Baker MP Lib Dem environment spokesman I do understand why people give to Future Forests, and I also understand why it's not best value for tree planting money. This is why The Tree Council is working with member organisations - that's the charities planting trees - to make it easier for the public to have an informed choice, and is currently working on a tree sponsorship code of practice. Pauline Buchanan Black Director-general, The Tree Council treecouncil.org.uk Anyone wishing to plant trees for whatever reason should subscribe to the Woodland Trust at woodland-trust.org.uk. It has been planting trees in the UK for more than 30 years (5m so far) and more than half its income is spent on land acquisition and planting.
