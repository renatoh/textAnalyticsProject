The Professional Cricketers' Association's annual player survey attracted responses from 277 county players, around 70% of the total employed. The PCA have previously registered their disappointment that David Morgan, the former chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, consulted so few of their members before recommending a cut in the County Championship programme from 16 matches per season to 14. The survey reveals that 91% of the players consider the Championship the most important competition, and that 93% believe that it should retain a symmetrical fixture list under which teams in each of the two divisions play the others home and away. That would have been removed under the Morgan Review proposal. \"We conclude that the 2012 structure is preferable to that proposed by the Morgan Review,\" say the authors of the PCA report. \"If there are to be any changes to this structure, we must \u2026retain the LV= County Championship in its current form.\" The Friends Life t20 competition is ranked second in importance to the Championship, ahead of the 40-over competition that leads to a Lord's final. But a majority of the PCA members oppose proposals to play t20 matches throughout the summer at regular \"appointment to view\" times \u2013 mostly either Friday nights or Sunday afternoons \u2013 and have instead urged the ECB to beef up the prize money on offer. \"In designing the optimal competition, we believe ECB must engage with players, spectators, sponsors and broadcasters (both at home and overseas) to understand how best to create a successful competition, played in front of large crowds, and attracting a good TV audience,\" the PCA say. \"That means a great spectator experience \u2026keen ticket prices \u2026and world-class players. To accomplish this we must be prepared to invest significant additional sums in the prize money at stake and we would propose \u00a31m for the winners.\" Meanwhile, the former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria seems increasingly likely to defend himself against charges of breaching the ECB's anti-corruption code at a hearing on 21 May. Kaneria, who has been accused by his former Essex team-mate Mervyn Westfield of luring him into spot-fixing, has applied for a British visa, according to Pakistani reports which quote his brother, Vicky, saying he has pleaded not guilty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
