Last year I was promoted to senior designer, with extra responsibility and a pay increase. I have thrown myself into the role and was looking forward to my bonus until I found a spreadsheet on the photocopier listing everyone's salaries. Not only does my manager get a huge salary, but is also looking forward to a huge bonus. One designer who works below me earns more than I do and a newly recruited colleague is on just a grand less than I earn. I do not see why I should put in extra work and not see any extra benefit. Any advice? DG A In my experience, the more you know about other people's salaries the more likely it is to upset you. I will assume that you were happy with your lot until you stumbled on that offending spreadsheet. I am almost certain that since you discovered what other people are earning, your creative fulfilment, harmony with colleagues and the knowledge that you are doing a meaningful job has taken a knock. That said, I am not clear whether your colleague who reports to you but earns more than you is male or female. If he is male, I am afraid that you have brushed up against the law of the corporate jungle. In this wilderness, the gender pay gap is perpetuated by a chronic lack of transparency over salary levels. In all but a few cases, discrimination flourishes under the veil of pay secrecy where employees cannot be sure that they are rewarded fairly. Research by the GMB trade union suggests that this gender pay gap is at its widest in London, eastern England, the south east and south west. However, take heart - it is not all doom and gloom. It is against the law to pay women less than a man for the same or similar work, but it can be difficult for women to find out whether they are being treated fairly. Female workers have the right to find out how much their male colleagues are being paid for doing the same job. Under employment law, women can submit a questionnaire to their boss to try to establish whether they are being treated less favourably, but it can be difficult to make effective claims. Refusing to fill in a questionnaire may count against an employer at an employment tribunal, but employers are not obliged to answer them. The Equal Pay Act 1970 provides that discrimination between the sexes in the terms of their contracts of employment is unlawful. This is typically reflected in salary, contractual bonus payments and other non-cash benefits. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 outlaws less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender in terms of any other matters relating to employment such as discretionary bonuses or holidays. You can either confront your manager and demand more money, or seek legal advice if you feel discriminated against. Alternatively, you can look out for other opportunities in your field. When you find a job that suits and pays better, you can let your manager know the main reason for quitting. There is a useful online pay analysis service that compares your job profile to the salary and benefits earned by other people with similar skills and experience. However, if you are truly happy in your job and value the fellowship with your colleagues, I would rise above the \"money issue\" and accept that the managers will always reserve the right to determine pay levels. In your case they seem to be generous with others and mean with you. Very few firms are entirely fair when it comes to pay. Your high-earning colleague is perhaps a better negotiator than you are. You might want to negotiate harder when it comes to your performance-related bonus. Ending salaries secrecy - as we have ended secrecy over who owns land or shares - is a new human resources challenge for progressive employers, but do not expect that to happen any time soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
