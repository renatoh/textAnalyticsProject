The 21-year-old Terry and his Chelsea team-mate Jody Morris have been charged with assault and affray after a nightclub incident in central London early this month. The England exclusion - including Under-21 games - comes at a time when Terry's career is peaking. The central defender had been widely tipped for promotion to the senior squad for the friendly in Holland on February 13. Worse, his prospects of making the World Cup squad, with Sven-Goran Eriksson naming his initial 30-strong pool at the end of April, are now extremely slim. Even if his case is concluded quickly and in his favour, he will have little time in which to impress the England coach. Though Terry and Morris deny the charges, the FA's action was virtually a formality after it barred the Leeds players Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate from England activity during their protracted court cases. The decision to ban Terry was unanimous and followed talks between the FA chief executive Adam Crozier, Eriksson, his No2 Tord Grip and the England Under-21 coach David Platt. An FA statement said: \"John Terry will not be considered for representative honours with England until the on-going legal process has been completed.\" Terry has been remanded until February 20, when committal proceedings take place. The FA has decided against drawing up a strict, co-ordinated policy towards players who are facing legal charges and will treat each case on an individual basis. Terry was also one of the four Chelsea players who drunkenly insulted American tourists at a Heathrow hotel the day after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. After that incident another of the Chelsea four, the midfielder Frank Lampard, was dropped from the senior England squad in what was seen as a demonstration of Eriksson's hard-line attitude. Real Madrid have written to Arsenal to deny reports that they are trying to sign Patrick Vieira, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said yesterday. \"The letter says they do not need Patrick and that [the story] was an invention...they are upset about it and do not need the destabilisation either.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
