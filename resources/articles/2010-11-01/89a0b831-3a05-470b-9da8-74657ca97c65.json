He launched the series with the Eighth in September, and conducts the Ninth in the new year. Here it was the Fifth, which he and the orchestra were due to take to his home town of Riga after the Birmingham performances. For all its fine detail and dramatic sweep, there still seems something a bit provisional about Nelsons's Mahler, as if he, as much as his audience, can still be surprised by what these works contain. Occasionally he pushes too hard \u2013 the opening trumpet calls, for instance, led straight into a gigantic climax that could have been held back for later \u2013 but once it settled down, the performance had perfect scale and perspective, with finely judged pianissimo playing from the CBSO strings in the Adagietto, and a firm sense of where the last movement was heading, and how the brass was going to lead it to that final, affirmative chorale. Before the symphony Simon Halsey had conducted the CBSO's Children's and Youth Choruses in Judith Weir's Storm, one of the products of her spell as the orchestra's composer-in-association in the late 1990s. A cycle of five settings of extracts from The Tempest, it clothes the disarmingly tonal vocal lines in shimmering textures from trios of flutes and cellos, along with three percussionists playing a variety of tuned and untuned wooden and metallic instruments. The appeal of the music is direct; it's a neatly conceived sequence, full of beguiling and wonderfully fresh sounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
