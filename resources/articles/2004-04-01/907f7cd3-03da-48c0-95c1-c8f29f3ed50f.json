Barring a sudden lack of appetite for the big time, the Norwich director and her beloved Canaries are winging their way back to the top flight. This astonishing victory revealed Norwich in their pomp. The manager Nigel Worthington has built on their tradition of being an attractive, passing team by adding a touch of steel which they will need to survive at a higher level. And in the flying Darren Huckerby, they have found the final piece of their promotion jigsaw. The former Manchester City, Leeds and Newcastle forward has found his spiritual home in East Anglia. Huckerby's timely double took his Norwich haul for the season to 11 goals, and he sounded the battle cry for the final charge. \"We're top of the league,\" he said. \"We're 11 points clear of the third-placed team, we've got a better goal difference than everybody else and we're winning games. There's a lot for us to feel happy about right now. We had lost our previous two away games before winning here. It's down to us now. We are aiming for the top.\" Norwich were behind three times. But once they clawed their way back to 3-3 early in the second half, relegation-threatened Burnley caved in. \"Our travelling fans have been brilliant all season and I'm sure they will stick with us,\" said Huckerby. \"We need them, and if we all stick together and work together between now and the end of the season, then hopefully big things will happen at this club.\" Two goals from Huckerby, another two from the previously unproductive Mathias Svensson and one from Leon McKenzie tore Burnley to shreds. \"We need to win three of our last seven games,\" said their manager Stan Ternent. \"But we will do it.\" Burnley could not have wished for a better start, taking a seventh-minute lead through Neil Wood only for Svensson to guide home his first seven minutes later. David May headed the home side into the lead again, only for Huckerby to equalise just after the half-hour. Burnley still looked lively at this stage and were soon back in front thanks to Robbie Blake's 21st goal of the season. Norwich, however, helped themselves to three second-half goals - and it could so easily have been more as Burnley's moribund defence crumbled.
