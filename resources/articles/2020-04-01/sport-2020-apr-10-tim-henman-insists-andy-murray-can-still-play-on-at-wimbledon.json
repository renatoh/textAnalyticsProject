Henman, who reached four semi-finals there and is an influential board member at the All England Club, which cancelled the 134th championships because of coronavirus, said Murray, 33 next month, may benefit from a rest. \u201cI saw him practise a few weeks ago when it looked as if there might be a chance to go to Miami [on 25 March, after the cancellation of Indian Wells],\u201d Henman said. \u201cAfter being out of the game as long as he has, and now with the progress he has made, he will be pretty frustrated because he is getting close to getting back out on the court. \u201cHe has missed so much tennis but perhaps [the break] will give him the opportunity \u2013 if his body and his hip enable him \u2013 to play longer, in age terms. I remember playing with Agassi after Andre had 18 months out, for very different reasons, but he came back fresh and invigorated to play. He kept going until he was 36. \u201cIn those days that was old for a top tennis player. I stopped when I was 33 and that was pretty old at the time. But with training techniques and injury prevention, players are certainly playing longer. So you would like to think that if Andy\u2019s body permits and he still has the motivation that I think he does there can still definitely be a few Wimbledons left in him yet.\u201d Henman said he had spoken to Roger Federer, who had planned to make his comeback at Wimbledon after knee surgery, and reckoned the eight-times champion, at 38, would be similarly frustrated, with dwindling opportunities left to add to his 20 majors. \u201cSomeone like Federer, coming to the end of his career, is devastated but understands the decision. It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.\u201d Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. \u201cFurther down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.\u201d He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. \u201cYou have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren\u2019t, I don\u2019t think anyone would be greatly surprised,\u201d Henman said. The game\u2019s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, leading them to the quarter-finals. \u201cIf I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely. But the world is a very, very different place right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
