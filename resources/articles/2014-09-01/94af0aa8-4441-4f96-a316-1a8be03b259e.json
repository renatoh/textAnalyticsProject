On the evidence of their contrasting wins in the fourth round on Monday that is not a sound betting proposition although, if the Scot can draw on his considerable store of perversity, he could surprise us all. A couple of hours after Djokovic had methodically dismantled the stubborn resistance of Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets, the 2012 champion was making slightly harder work of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the late-afternoon heat on Arthur Ashe. He won 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours and 25 minutes \u2013 about 20 minutes longer than it took Djokovic to beat the German 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 on Louis Armstrong, the court Murray regards as some malign architectural plot against his expansive running game. At least from this point on he will be on the main court. If that journey is to last beyond his 21st match against the world No 1 (he trails Djokovic 8-12), he should be reaching championship pitch. Murray was subdued but reasonably satisfied with his performance. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m that far away from playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a long way from trying to win the tournament: nine sets now, three matches, and just try and take it one set at a time. I\u2019m maybe five, six days away from potentially winning another grand slam. I know there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.\u201d As a veteran American tennis writer said on the way out of the press conference, \u201cHe always talks as if he\u2019s got his toe caught in a mangle. He should learn to enjoy these moments.\u201d That has never been the deal. The joy is for later; right now, he is in the middle of his shift. As for Tsonga, the ninth seedexplained his erratic tennis simply: \u201cTennis is never a straight line. Maybe today the line was like this [indicating a dip] at the wrong moment. But it was still pretty good tennis.\u201d Murray, of course, had much to do with Tsonga\u2019s dilemma, selecting the slumps in the Frenchman\u2019s energy to strike hard in each set. While this was not the Murray of 2012 \u2013 or Wimbledon 2013, when he was similarly tough in the final against Djokovic \u2013 he will take consolation from the fact that he added consistency to his tennis, something that was palpably missing in his first-round match against Robin Haase and on Sunday against Andrey Kuznetsov, when he dropped a set each time. This was closer to the performance he put in on Ashe on Thursday night \u2013 his favourite venue and time of day \u2013 against Matthias Bachinger. He was near flawless then, less so here, but there were encouraging signs he is getting sharper all round. Murray continues to make a good friend of the net. Against Haase he won 25 of 39 visits; in the second round against Bachinger he upped his percentage with 22 successful raids from 26; against Kuznetsov, it was 29 from 33; and on Monday he kept Tsonga guessing with his forward rushes, winning 28 of 31 net points. The most emphatic of those was the backhand volley to take the first set, struck with thunder after pinning Tsonga deep with an equally firm forehand. When Murray plays like this he is irresistible. There was evidence of it in patches thereafter but he owed his win to stickability and doggedness, looking particularly spent after winning the second set. The third saw Tsonga\u2019s game fall slowly to pieces, with two double faults in his final service game a sad sign-off to a tournament in which he has occasionally looked magnificent. There have been passages of brilliance in the first eight days here when Djokovic has looked as good as he did in that long, unbeaten run in 2011, and he produced enough of them to beat Kohlschreiber with plenty to spare. The German, good as he can be on his best day, was only occasionally at the Serb\u2019s level in stifling conditions. \u201cIt was very humid for both of us,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cwith a lot of long rallies, especially in the second and third. It could have gone either way, especially in the second set.\u201d That hardly told the story of Djokovic\u2019s excellent serving (six aces, no double faults, 78 per cent winning points on first serve, 68 on second), or his low unforced error count of 19. \u201cIt\u2019s great that I have been playing some really good tennis, really high quality so far,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s normal to expect that I\u2019m going to have tougher opponents as the tournament goes on. A quarter-final against Murray, it\u2019s a very tough draw.\u201d He is in the quarter-finals for the eighth year in a row \u2013 and 22nd consecutively in majors since Ernests Gulbis put him out in the third round at Roland Garros four years ago. But he hungers for more than lower-level statistics. What he wants is success where it matters, on the final day. He has won the title once in four consecutive finals, beating Rafael Nadal in a classic match three years ago. But what has consumed Djokovic at what should be the peak of his career has been his inability regularly to find the game with which he first challenged the hegemony of Roger Federer and Nadal. He won five of his first seven finals in majors, then lost five of his next six. However, in putting away Sam Querrey, Paul-Henri Matthieu and Diego Schwartzman in the first week here he did not lose a set, was broken only four times and converted 21 of 36 break points. Against Kohlschreiber he saved the only two break points against him. He looks ready to do some damage. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2014. An earlier version said that in the first week at Flushing Meadows Djokovic did not drop serve. That should have been he did not lose a set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
