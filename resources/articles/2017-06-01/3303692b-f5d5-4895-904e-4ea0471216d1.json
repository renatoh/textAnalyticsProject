Polls have the contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff in a statistical dead heat. GOP candidate says journalism has fueled \u2018lack of civility\u2019 The election is now the most expensive House race in history and the outcome is being watched closely by many who see it as a referendum on Trump. The seat in the traditionally red district was vacated by Trump\u2019s health secretary, Tom Price. \u201cThere is a lack of civility in society as a whole, social media has been fueling it, journalism has been fueling it,\u201d the Republican Karen Handel told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs, who was physically assaulted by a soon-to-be congressman for asking a question a few weeks ago. This is a deep-rooted problem in American politics right now which is going to take work and bipartisan commitment to try to heal wounds and focus on substance instead of fear-mongering and slander. \u2013 Jon Ossoff on political incivility The Democratic senators Cory Booker (New Jersey), Brian Schatz (Hawaii) and Chris Murphy (Connecticut) livestreamed an unsuccessful Tuesday trip to the Congressional Budget Office to try to see a copy of the healthcare bill Senate Republicans are trying to push through. Despite strong objections by Democrats to the opaque and hurried process currently under way in the Senate, Republicans are still angling for a vote on the (so far secret) bill by next week. In his first on-camera press briefing in over a week, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to answer whether Trump believes that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, despite US intel saying it did. Spicer said he and the president hadn\u2019t discussed the matter. The press secretary may finally be preparing to leave his role in favor of something more behind the scenes, according to multiple media reports.
