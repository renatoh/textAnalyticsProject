After laying a wreath and a Serbian flag on Milosevic's coffin as it emerged from the plane, tearful Socialist party officials accompanied it to a morgue where it will be kept until they finalise plans to put his body on public display in central Belgrade. \"It is not certain when people will be able to see the body,\" said Vanja Vukic, a Socialist party spokesman, as the plane carrying Milosevic's body flew in from the Netherlands, to where he was extradited in October 2005 to face 66 counts of war crimes. \"But there will be a huge public ceremony in front of the Yugoslav federation building at midday on Saturday.\" Milosevic will then be buried where he was born, at his family home in Pozarevac, 50 miles south-east of Belgrade. Serbia's president refused to give Milosevic a state funeral or a place in Belgrade's revered Avenue of Heroes cemetery, saying it would be unsuitable for a man who died in a cell at the UN court in The Hague. But the Socialists continued to argue with the minority government, which they support, over the return of Milosevic's widow, Mira, to Belgrade. A warrant for her arrest on charges of abuse of power was suspended by a Serbian court, on condition that she hand over her passport on arrival from Moscow. She also faces questioning about the murder of former Serb president Ivan Stambolic. Officials maintained that Mira - dubbed the \"Red Witch\" for her communist leanings and \"Lady Macbeth\" for her powers of manipulation - would be arrested if she failed to turn up to a Belgrade court hearing on March 23. \"She is innocent and shouldn't even be in court,\" insisted Mr Vukic. \"But I'm sure she will come back with Marko [her son]. At a Christian funeral, the family must be here.\" After receiving his father's body from coroners at The Hague, Marko was believed to have flown back to Moscow, from where some Socialist officials said he would arrive in Belgrade today with his mother. But while Milosevic's supporters predicted that tens of thousands of people would descend on Belgrade for Saturday's ceremony, many Serbs were less enthusiastic about the homecoming of a leader whose belligerence left their country poor and isolated. \"Milosevic and his family are a disgrace,\" said Belgrade businessman Dragan Djordjevic. \"They ruined our lives, and now we are expected to welcome them back. If this government lets Mira and Marko go free then they are worse than everyone thinks.\" In Pozarevac, opinion was sharply divided on its most famous family. The high green gate outside the Milosevic home was decked with red flowers. \"Slobo, you were a giant among the world's dwarves,\" read the message on one garland. \"You were and always will be a hero to the Serb people.\" Pensioner Pavle Djalovic said Milosevic \"was the greatest Serb leader of the 20th century. If he was buried here, it would be a great honour. Whatever happens, his name will always be associated with Pozarevac.\" But for many of the town's 50,000 residents, that association is malign. \"People were scared of Marko and that old cow Mira,\" said 48-year-old Dragana. \"If Marko picked out a cafe it would be closed. If he picked out a person he would be beaten up. He was aggressive and arrogant - really like a gangster,\" she added. \"If they came back here, a lot of angry people would be waiting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
