Less than a 10 minute drive away, parents took their children to Marvel Stadium to a see a genuine superhero, Carlton No 9. For Blues fans, Patrick Cripps is by far the best reason to go to the football. It is quite a burden for the Carlton captain who during the past month has had so little time to be his best self, suffering the humiliations of the corporeal world. Bum-rushed by taggers at every turn, he has played as if pushed down by the weight of speculation that his coach\u2019s tenure was drawing to an end. Something Cripps himself admitted. \u201cMentally, the last three weeks have been pretty full on,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as you\u2019d like to say it doesn\u2019t affect you, it does drain you and it\u2019s no disrespect to the players I\u2019ve played on the last three weeks. I needed to respond... I was disappointed with how I played the last three weeks.\u201d Cripps is not a man to embrace the perpetual melancholy of the underdog and respond he did, executing his duty (not to mention Brisbane\u2019s midfield) with resourcefulness and strength. In a week where the commentary around the club was eschatological, and with his side goalless and 37 points down six minutes into the second quarter, the 195cm midfielder metaphorically put 20 men on his shoulders and carried them to a 15-point win. Consider Cripps\u2019 numbers. 38 disposals (23 in the second half) 16 contested possessions A disposal efficiency of 82% Four goals (all in the second half while Brisbane kicked just three) Eight clearances Seven marks Nine score involvements 19 pressure acts Five inside 50s Three rebound 50s Six producers bidding for the rights to film the Patrick Cripps bio-pic Cripps\u2019 game was widely considered as the best individual performance the season, particularly in the perspective of it coming on the back of a category 5 storm that tested the very limits of Blues fans\u2019 faith in the game. Were it to be packaged with the other 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it would come with the following testimonials: \u201cProbably one of the best individual performances I\u2019ve ever seen on a football field.\u201d Dayne Zorko, Brisbane Lions midfielder \u201cCrippa was unreal. It was as good a game as I\u2019ve seen. We love playing with him and we are lucky to have him.\u201d Charlie Curnow, teammate \u201cHe\u2019s obviously had a massive week being a skipper of the footy club when this change happens, and the emotional toll it takes\u2026 So to go out there and perform the way he did was incredible. It\u2019s testament to all the hard work he puts in.\u201d Sam Docherty, Carlton co-captain \u201cHe\u2019s the MVP of the whole competition.\u201d Jimmy Bartell, Brownlow medallist And at just 24 years of age Cripps is entwined in a legacy that is green and still growing. For a man with such a brutal, physical presence, he has a large, hammer-like engine that appears content to purr. Even as he burst through three Lions defenders to kick his third goal, there was a sense of enormous power held in reserve. In these moments it is easy to see Cripps as a super hero comic strip. This fragments his action. In the first panel, he shrugs off a lunging opponent \u201cPOW!\u201d. In the second, he boots the ball towards goal \u201cBANG!\u201d. In the final panel a sly, self-knowing smile floats across his eyes in the revelatory moment that he is responsible for the biggest Carlton miracle since Anthony Koutoufides rolled away the stone in the 1999 preliminary final. But in isolation, Cripps\u2019 game is simply a fleeting lift of his club\u2019s spirits. This is not to diminish his performance, but rather place it in the context of the \u201cwe\u2019re glad you\u2019ll be joining us for year 16 of our eternal rebuilding project\u201d coming out of Carlton. For the Blues to be relevant, and for Cripps to fully realise his powers, Carlton must cultivate an ensemble cast of heroes. Perhaps that will come with the freedom caretaker coach David Teague has given his players, one that on a first reading appears to be less prescriptive, subscribing to the theory that the smart dog obeys, the smarter dog knows when to disobey. The challenge for whoever coaches Carlton in 2020 is to bring out the best in Patrick Cripps, but simultaneously lessen the reliance on him. You only need to look at Marvel to understand that one superhero can only carry so many films."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
