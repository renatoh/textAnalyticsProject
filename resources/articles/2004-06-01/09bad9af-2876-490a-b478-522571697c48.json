Not only that, he was relaxed enough to confirm that today he will bow to the judgment of England's coach Duncan Fletcher that he should drop down the order to No4, filling the vacancy left by Nasser Hussain and allowing Andrew Strauss to embed himself at opener after an impressive Test debut at Lord's. He is wise enough to realise that this is not just a convenient short-term shuffle but a potential watershed in his international career. \"I'm not that fussed where I bat but if I do move down to No4 I recognise that it will be a career move,\" he said. \"It is something that I have spoken to Duncan Fletcher about for quite some time. Now that Andrew Strauss has come in and done so well, it seems the ideal time to do it.\" A Totesport League match only three days before a Test is the sort of fixture that England captains routinely ignore in these days of central contracts. It required a 400-mile round trip by coach from Yorkshire in bank holiday traffic for Vaughan to confirm the recovery of the knee he twisted during the build-up to the Lord's Test a fortnight ago. But this was far more than a necessary fitness check, it was an innings he desperately needed. It was his first knock of the season, 26 days after he batted in the last one-day international against West Indies. Test players are attuned to flitting from series to series but he looked rusty, deliberating 62 balls on a sluggish pitch before he was run out for 32. Phil Jaques called him for a single that would have been beyond him at his fittest. He was three yards short as Steve Knox hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end. \"I'd no chance,\" he said. \"I've never had knees like Linford Christie's. I'd have liked to have batted for longer but about 1 hour in the middle was ideal. The conditions were quite tough and it will do me a lot of good. I'd never say I'll never have any more knee trouble - they have been dodgy for a few years - but Lord's was just bad luck and the rehab has gone well.\" English county crowds tend to be twice the average age of the players; Scotland do it the other way around. Most of Vaughan's unconvincing moments came against the seasoned medium-pace in swing of Asim Butt, a Leith shopkeeper whose age is as changeable as the Scottish weather. Yesterday he was 36 and the skies were blue, but it may be 38 and showery later. Vaughan ticked off the fitness questions carefully. Sensing a single off the mark, he was sent back by Matthew Wood, which at least proved he could turn reasonably quickly. There were a couple of sprightly threes and he dared to get down on his knee to sweep. He also satisfied those who had pestered him to bowl his off-spinners, as a forerunner for England fielding an otherwise all-seam attack at Leeds. But it felt like tokenism - two overs as Scotland's promising pursuit of Yorkshire's 199 faded to a fifth successive defeat. As a Yorkshireman, Vaughan can keep Headingley's reputation as a seam-bowling haven in perspective and so will keep faith with Ashley Giles's left-arm slows. Quite a lot has happened since Vaughan yelped with agony during practice at Lord's, not least the retirement of Hussain. The decision was made by the time Hussain phoned, so Vaughan just thanked him and wished him luck. He does not fret about such things. \"We've lost quite a few experienced players recently - Gough, Stewart, Atherton -and the team has moved on,\" he said. Hussain has also marked his retirement by pronouncing that England should not go to Zimbabwe. Vaughan does not have such liberties. \"Until the ECB make a decision the players can do very little,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
