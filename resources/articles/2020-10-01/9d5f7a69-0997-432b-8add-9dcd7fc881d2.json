The penning of the article, and a subsequent book on the same theme, sparked a slew of media coverage and wild Washington speculation as to the identity of the author. It also angered Donald Trump and many of his top officials, who launched a frantic and unsuccessful hunt for the mole throughout the White House staff and beyond. In a statement Taylor said: \u201cI am a Republican, and I wanted this president to succeed.\u201d But he added: \u201cBut too often in times of crisis, Donald Trump has proven he is a man without character, and his personal defects have resulted in leadership failures so significant that they can be measured in lost American lives.\u201d He went on to urge people to vote for Joe Biden and admitted that one of the guiding principles behind his op-ed had been mistaken. \u201cThe country cannot rely on well-intentioned, unelected bureaucrats around the president to steer him towards right. He has purged most of them anyway,\u201d Taylor wrote. Taylor left the Trump administration in 2019, and went public with his criticism of the president in August, with an ad from the group Republican Voters Against Trump, in which he endorsed Biden. In the ad, Taylor accused Trump of trying to \u201cexploit the Department of Homeland Security for his own political purposes and to fuel his own agenda\u201d. Taylor said in the ad: \u201cGiven what I experienced in the administration, I have to support Joe Biden for president.\u201d In response to the revelation, the Trump campaign issued a typically aggressive statement. \u201cThis is the least impressive, lamest political \u2018reveal\u2019 of all time. I worked with DHS officials while I was in the White House, and even I had to research who Miles Taylor was. He\u2019s just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
