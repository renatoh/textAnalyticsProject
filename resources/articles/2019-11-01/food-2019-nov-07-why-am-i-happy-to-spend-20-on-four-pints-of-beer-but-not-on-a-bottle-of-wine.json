If I give you a tenner, will you mow my lawn?\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d Money, far from being a fixed, fungible quantity, changes value depending on how you feel about what you\u2019re spending it on. After the crash, \u201cbehavioural\u201d got to be shorthand for \u201cWhy did all those people behave so crazy?\u201d But actually the pre-crash question \u2013 \u201cWhy are some tenners worth more than others?\u201d \u2013 was more interesting. Nowhere is this more obvious than with food and drink. I will think nothing, for instance, of having two pints with my mister on an average midweek evening, which is (quick maths) four pints, or 20 quid. I would no more buy a \u00a320 bottle of wine on a Wednesday than I would go to Hawaii for a mini-break. I don\u2019t mind at all going out for a fancy kebab irrespective of whether or not it\u2019s my birthday, yet when a butcher casually lifted \u00a35.95 off me for a lamb shank, I was still talking about it days later (I\u2019m still talking about it now). I would never look at the cost of a main course and think: \u201cHow was it possible to get to 17 quid for a mackerel?\u201d \u2013 I merely accept the restaurant\u2019s decision. Yet the tag on side dishes sets off my daylight-burglar alarm: \u00a34.50 for spring greens? No, really though. There had better be a tonne of them. At those prices, I want enough spring greens to put me off spring. Many concepts of value are locked down in childhood, so I think of a steak as barely a domestic food at all, instead a biannual event for when something exceptionally good or bad has happened. I will make meringues rather than throw away an egg white, casually pouring away two hours of relatively concentrated effort for the sake of 36p, tops. I balk at the price of orange juice, but I have no problem spending four times as much on a kombucha drink because it\u2019s there. Fermentation wasn\u2019t a thing in the 80s, unless you were talking about home brewing. I have no mind map for whether or not it\u2019s a ripoff \u2013 I just want to see if it\u2019s tasty. Put a takeaway menu in front of me and there is no limit to the amount of prawn toast I can afford. Spending \u00a370 getting someone to arrive at the front door with a meal for five seems completely reasonable. Would I pay a person \u00a350, though, to arrive and cook \u00a320 worth of ingredients for us? What do you take me for \u2013 Rupert Murdoch? Money arguments in relationships are often proxy battles over more important things such as love, power and control. Food-money is a proxy for smaller conflicts. So my beloved hates it when I use finishing salt where table salt would do, and he says: \u201cAre you using my salt in pasta water?\u201d And I go: \u201cHow is this your salt? How about these scissors? Are they your scissors or our scissors?\u201d And I hate it when he bulk-buys high-effort food items, since it triggers some pre-verbal feminist defence mechanism against the possibility that my time has been appropriated by the patriarchy. And maybe you will side with him on that, and suggest that he was intending to cook them himself. But you\u2019re not the one with four rabbits and 24 kippers in your freezer. And finally, there\u2019s mortality: food can make you forget you\u2019re mortal. You see a Creme Egg or a blackberry and it reminds you that, whatever happens, Easter will reappear and so will autumn, that you are in a world of perpetual renewal and if you hitch your destiny to the Creme Egg, you too can live for ever. I will drop a fortune on samphire just because I\u2019m pleased to see its time come round again. In the same way, hatred of throwing away food isn\u2019t really about the waste, and it definitely isn\u2019t about the cost \u2013 it\u2019s about fighting the horrifying truth that, whatever your best intentions, everything must perish and the march of decay is relentless. In practice, though, this means keeping tiny bowls of grated carrot that cost less than a mouthful of espresso and eating yoghurt that is a full month out of date and daring it to fizz. I tried to persuade my kid the other day that an Actimel she had left in her school bag was OK and, when she opened it, it exploded all over both of us. This will be laid down in family lore as evidence of my outrageous tightness, but that\u2019s not what it is. Food is its own currency, as emotional as the lira, as stubborn as the deutschmark, as up-on-its-dignity as the pound. Sorry for the 20th-century analogies, but there it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
