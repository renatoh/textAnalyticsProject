The president told the prime minister in talks at the White House that he understood that the Aamer case is a matter of great interest in Britain, though he said that he would act in a way that protects US national security. Bernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokesperson, said: \u201cPrime minister Cameron raised this case with the president, and the president told him that he understands why this case is of great interest to the prime minister and the British people. The president committed to the prime minister that we will prioritise this case, while making sure any action taken is consistent with our national security.\u201d Britain hopes to persuade the US authorities to release Aamer and allow him to be sent to Britain amid fears that he could be sent to Saudi Arabia if Obama succeeds in meeting his pledge to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay by the end of his presidency. Speaking before his meeting with the president, the prime minister said: \u201cI have raised the case in the past. I will raise it again. It is important. I know that the policy of the US government is progressively to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay and so I think there is every opportunity to raise this case and hope to, over time, make some progress.\u201d British officials fear that Aamer, a British resident who was born in Saudi Arabia and who has been held at the US base since 2002, will not be safe if he is deported to Saudi Arabia. Aamer who has not been charged with any offence despite being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay since 2002 after being detained in Afghanistan in 2001 where he said he was working for a charity. Cameron, who raised the case of Shaker Aamer with Obama at the G8 summit in Lough Erne in 2013, was not expecting a breakthrough during his talks with Obama at the White House. Britain accepts privately that it is currently unable to provide the US authorities with assurances that it would have a legal basis for monitoring Aamer on his return to the UK. The prime minister knows that he has to lobby on behalf of Aamer in Washington with care because of the key role played by the US Congress on Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Congress has to be given 30 days notice of any release from Guant\u00e1namo. Congress could also jeopardise Obama\u2019s plans to close the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centre by the end of his second term if there is an adverse response to a release. A British government source said of Obama\u2019s response: \u201cWe see this as a step forward. We now need to keep working with the Americans and continue our discussions to resolve this case once and for all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
