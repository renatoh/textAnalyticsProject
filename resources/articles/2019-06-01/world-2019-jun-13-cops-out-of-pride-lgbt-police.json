Some queer New Yorkers had a simple response: apology not accepted. \u201cIt was a symbolic PR stunt,\u201d said Colin P Ashley, a local queer black activist. \u201cThe NYPD is still an oppressive force in so many lives.\u201d Ashley is part of Reclaim Pride, a coalition that wants more than a 50-year-late apology. The group wants police removed from Pride altogether. Queer and trans activists across the US are engaging in \u201ccops out of Pride\u201d efforts this month, with protests and alternative \u201ccop-free\u201d events that seek to recognize the ongoing police mistreatment of LGBT people. These groups are pushing back against corporate-sponsored parades that embrace police in the name of \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201cunity\u201d \u2013 and return to the radical and riotous roots of the movement. \u201cPolice have often been a force of terror for queer and trans communities,\u201d said Malkia Devich Cyril, a queer activist and leader in the group Movement for Black Lives, who said they won\u2019t be attending San Francisco Pride due to the way police and corporations have co-opted it. \u201cThe efforts to remove policing from Pride are really efforts to ensure safety for the communities that are there. It\u2019s a protective act. It\u2019s an act of resistance,\u201d said Cyril, whose mother was a member of the Black Panthers. \u201cIt\u2019s an act that attempts to restore some measure of safety to our rights to organize.\u201d Opposition to law enforcement marching in Pride parades is not new, but has intensified this year as the festivals have adopted themes honoring the anniversary of Stonewall, the LGBT rebellion against police abuses that led to the first Pride march and cemented June as Pride month around the globe. \u201cThe tide is growing around the idea of restricting police involvement in Pride across the country, and across the world,\u201d said Ashley, whose group is organizing a Queer Liberation march on 30 June separate from the city\u2019s world-famous parade. Police aren\u2019t invited. Some Pride organizers have argued that the festivals are an opportunity to build bridges between law enforcement and queer communities, that LGBT officers deserve to march, and that the police brutality of 1969 is not today\u2019s reality. But in California, New York, Florida and other regions this year, activists are standing up to pro-police LGBT leaders. \u2018Police are not standing with us\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to \u2018build a bridge\u2019 with police officers who keep burning them down,\u201d said Alex Andrews, a sex worker activist in Florida, who was upset to learn this week that a police contingent was scheduled to march just a few groups behind her Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP) coalition at St Pete Pride on Sunday. \u201cWe want to march and we want to be proud participants, but there\u2019s going to be this element of fear that is going to be following us.\u201d Sex workers were integral to the original Stonewall riot, and many who work in the underground industry today are queer and trans people who have reported suffering violence, arrests and harassment at the hands of police. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a punch in the gut,\u201d said Kristen Cain, another SWOP organizer in Florida, who is bisexual. Pride is about \u201cfamily for me\u201d, she said, the holiday she most cherishes every year, but now she is feeling anxiety about police: \u201cThey are not standing with us, they are actively fighting against us.\u201d Some queer groups have organized mass actions in response. In Sacramento, hundreds of demonstrators blocked an entrance to the city\u2019s festival, carrying \u201cNo Cops at Pride\u201d and \u201cBlack Trans Lives Matter\u201d signs. Pride organizers had initially said police would be banned from marching in uniform to honor community members \u201charmed by police violence\u201d, but reversed course days before the event. \u201cPolice don\u2019t protect us,\u201d said Ayotunde Ikuku, who is part of a group called Still Here that organized the protest. \u201cEvery other day, we are trying to not be murdered by them.\u201d Ikuku, a 22-year-old non-binary black activist, said some Pride attendees were uninterested in learning about the protest, and even enraged at the disruption. A group of older white gay men were openly hostile, racist and violent to the protesters, they said: \u201cThere was such unwarranted anger misdirected at us.\u201d Some videos captured physical confrontations, and at least one man mocking a protester for being trans. \u201cThere was just a lot of hate,\u201d said Ikuku, adding that it was clear some gay people were satisfied with marriage equality and uninterested in the continued struggles of other LGBT people: \u201cThey could support us, too, and would lose nothing from doing that \u2026 Pride is about showing up for our community who is not shown up for, who is not heard.\u201d Police violations of LGBT Sacramento residents are also not a concern of the past, activists noted. Last year, a black trans woman protesting the police killing of unarmed Stephon Clark was arrested by Sacramento police and thrown in the male section of the county jail. Independence Taylor, a 21-year-old Still Here activist, said that when he was a homeless teenager on the streets of Sacramento, police would mock and threaten him and the other trans and queer youth, waking them up in the middle of the night. With police welcomed by festival organizers, he said, \u201cI worried about the security and safety of my friends of color \u2026 It makes me feel like any wrong move could be cause for them to walk up to me and harass me.\u201d Some of the attendees opposing Still Here just wanted to \u201cparty\u201d or believed Pride should be about \u201clove and unity\u201d, said Taylor, adding that he wished the event was welcoming to low-income and homeless queer people, who can\u2019t afford tickets: \u201cDon\u2019t keep people out \u2026 Pride to me should be a day of community building and community education.\u201d While some have argued that police are necessary for public safety purposes at Pride, others have said there are ways for communities to provide their own security. Ikuku cited the work of the Black Panthers as a model for community patrols. Why gay cops aren\u2019t welcome In San Francisco, home to one of the biggest Pride parades in the country, the police department (SFPD) has given out rainbow \u201cpride patches\u201d for officers to wear this month, and has a \u201cPride SUV\u201d that will drive in the parade, a spokesperson said, adding that officers and their \u201cfamilies and friends are looking forward to walking in this year\u2019s parade\u201d. SF Pride\u2019s theme this year is \u201cgenerations of resistance\u201d, which some critics have argued is particularly insulting given this embrace of SFPD, which raided a queer hangout spot in 1966, sparking a rebellion against police in a riot that pre-dated Stonewall. \u201cKick cops and corporations out of pride\u201d stickers are common around the Bay Area, spread by an activist group called Gay Shame, made up of mostly working-class trans people of color. Police \u201cexist to kill and torture black and brown people\u201d, the group said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cIf you are [celebrating] cops, you are celebrating white supremacy, there is no way around it. A Pride cop car is like a rainbow confederate flag.\u201d They added: \u201cPeople say that we just need more trainings and more LGBT cops, but you cant reform a system that is built on racial terror.\u201d At Pride in Detroit this year, neo-Nazis disrupted the celebrations and police, in effect, provided an armed escort for the white supremacists in an effort, officials said, to prevent violent clashes. In New York, the police commissioner\u2019s belated apology was limited to the event 50 years ago, and did not acknowledge ongoing problems. \u201cWe reject this apology. It\u2019s empty,\u201d said Natalie James, a co-founder of Reclaim Pride. \u201cIt implies as if the police abuses are a [historical] thing.\u201d Ashley said the apology did not change his mind that police should be unwelcome at Pride \u2013 including the gay ones: \u201cWhile I understand the struggles of black police in an institution that is racist, and I understand the struggles of gay officers in an institution that is still homophobic, the institution as a whole is still oppressive to these communities.\u201d One day after the commissioner\u2019s apology, Layleen Polanco, a trans woman, died inside New York\u2019s notorious Rikers island jail, where she was housed in solitary confinement, and stuck behind bars because she couldn\u2019t afford bail for a misdemeanor charge. \u201cWe have made no progress,\u201d said James. \u201cThe NYPD as it exists is antithetical to queer liberation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
