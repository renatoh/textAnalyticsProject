The victory over Slovenia on Saturday maintained England\u2019s perfect start to their qualifying campaign for Euro 2016, though a first visit to Glasgow in 15 years will arguably provide a sterner examination of this young team\u2019s progress since the summer\u2019s trauma at the World Cup finals. Hodgson will hand the West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino a senior debut in the friendly at some stage, with Fraser Forster expected to start in goal following Joe Hart\u2019s release back to Manchester City. Ross Barkley is also likely to feature. Those youngsters will be tested by a Scotland side who have lost only once in 10 games under Gordon Strachan \u2013 and that against the World Cup winners, Germany, in Dortmund \u2013 and have been boosted by Friday\u2019s key qualifying success over the Republic of Ireland. \u201cIt will be a test,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThe Scottish fans are exceptional, especially at Celtic Park where they are very good at supporting their team. That is all to the good. That is what we need. But a game like that in Scotland will probably tell me a little bit more about this team. \u201cWe have done all we can do in these first four qualifying games so we are reasonably satisfied with that, but we know there is a long way to go before France 2016. We know there are a lot of stern tests ahead and it starts on Tuesday night and we will learn lessons. I hope the players who get a chance to play will, firstly, be able to stand up to any pressures and the crowd pressure and, secondly, I hope they will learn from it. Any lessons we take from it will only be valuable in the future. We know what we are in for and we know the way we play and we are up for it.\u201d Scotland\u2019s frenetic win against Ireland, secured courtesy of Shaun Maloney\u2019s excellent finish amid the frenzy, served notice of what awaits in Glasgow. \u201cFrom watching the game the other night they were kicking lumps out of each other, weren\u2019t they?\u201d said the squad goalkeeper Ben Foster, who may also benefit from some game-time with England likely to use all six permitted substitutions. \u201cIt was a good watch, very high-tempo, and I could feel the atmosphere sitting on my bed watching it. It was almost like they were getting more up for good tackles than they were for good passes. I\u2019m sure we can expect pretty much the same atmosphere and the same sort of game, so it would be a good one to be involved with.\u201d While Hodgson will offer those not involved against Slovenia time on the pitch at some stage, he may retain a relatively settled lineup from the start with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck expected to begin in attack, and Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson likely to feature in midfield. Stewart Downing, who has been nursing a slight knee injury, should make his first appearance since Hodgson\u2019s first game in charge \u2013 a friendly in Norway before Euro 2012 \u2013 and Luke Shaw, troubled by a groin complaint, will also be involved at left-back. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be very friendly,\u201d Wilshere said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be ready for that. It\u2019ll be a bit like Arsenal against Tottenham, Liverpool against Manchester United, but we\u2019re used to that as players. We played them at Wembley a year ago [a 3-2 success for England] and it wasn\u2019t the friendliest then so we know what we\u2019re in for. They\u2019ll be a bit more up for it on their home ground so we\u2019ll be ready for it. \u201cThe manager has already given us a speech about England against Scotland and told us that, back in the day, it was the highlight of the season. We know what we\u2019re walking into and we\u2019ll be ready. I want to play. I\u2019m desperate to play. They are the games that every England player wants to be playing in. Ask any member of my family or anyone who knows what it\u2019s like, and they\u2019d never forgive me if I didn\u2019t play. I want to experience that England-Scotland atmosphere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
