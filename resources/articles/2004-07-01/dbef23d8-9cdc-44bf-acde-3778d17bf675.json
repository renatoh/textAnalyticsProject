His political influence shows no sign of weakening, getting Tony Blair to call a referendum on the European constitution on the one hand, while keeping Michael Howard guessing by inviting him to the News Corporation thinktank in Cancun in Mexico. And when it comes to his financial authority, Mr Murdoch, 73, has seen his power vindicated. When his son James - who enters the MediaGuardian 100 list this year at number 12 - was picked to be the new chief executive of BSkyB at the age of just 30, many investors were unhappy, citing the young Murdoch's inexperience and alleging nepotism had played a part in his appointment. They even threatened to block the move, hoping they could overcome News Corp's 35.4% holding in BSkyB. But Murdoch senior knew he could win the vote and confidently answered the complaints of shareholders when he chaired the annual general meeting just days after James's appointment in November. Meanwhile, at his newspapers, Mr Murdoch has overseen the Times' transition to a dual-format publication, a measure that has arrested the paper's circulation decline. But while the Times followed the Independent's lead in going tabloid it has yet to win over enough readers for it to ditch its broadsheet format. As for James, he will be eager this year to prove himself capable of building on the legacy of his highly regarded predecessor at the satellite broadcaster, Tony Ball. BSkyB is still in pole position in the pay-TV arena, but subscriber growth slumped in the first quarter of 2004 and James will need to reassure the City that the company is still on track to meet its target of 8 million subscribers by the end of 2005. The young chief executive may be short on experience, but he is a polished performer and has the advantage of an excellent relationship with the company's chairman. The working relationship of the top two figures at ITV is arguably less assured but no less important. Chairman Sir Peter Burt (ranked fourth) was appointed in February to keep a stiff watch over the newly merged broadcaster's management, headed by chief executive Charles Allen (30). Their relative placing in this year's list gives a clue to the perceived power balance between the two men - Mr Burt has Mr Allen's fate in his hands. So far the chief executive has had a good year, getting the merger through on favourable terms and promising savings to come. But if he is to escape the fate that befell former ITV chairman-to-be Michael Green he must quieten the sniping of shareholders and gain the confidence of the chairman. In the world of advertising, Sir Martin Sorrell (9) remains Britain's pre-eminent figure, leading his WPP to the takeover of Cordiant last year and hinting only last month that he might be looking at the assets of Grey Global. As the industry's leading clairvoyant, Sir Martin proclaimed the recession formally dead this year, or, to use his favourite metaphor, said it had \"climbed out of the bath\" - although he did warn of a \"shower\" in 2005. Newspaper bosses figure prominently this year as the country looks forward to a likely general election in spring 2005. Top of the pile are the Barclay brothers (11), fresh from their triumph in the auction for the Telegraph. The billionaire twins headed off a strong field of bidders, including Viscount Rothermere's (12) DMGT and Richard Desmond (13), owner of the Express. They may be bitter rivals, but the three proprietors are all agreed in their allegiance to the Conservatives, and between them they will generate plenty of trouble for Labour even if the Tories themselves fail to convince voters they are a government-in-waiting. The Daily Mirror is likely to stay loyal to the government despite the severe criticism of its policies on Iraq and other matters fomer editor Piers Morgan doled out in the last year. The politics of the Mirror's new editor, Richard Wallace, politics are not so clear - but Mr Blair made a point of meeting him on only his second day at the helm. The woman responsible for his departure, Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey, has impressed the City in her first year at the company. But with circulation falling across the company's national newspapers, she has plenty of work to do. The final member of this year's City top 10 is Tom Moloney (21), who runs publishing and radio group Emap and has a huge stable of media brands under his watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
