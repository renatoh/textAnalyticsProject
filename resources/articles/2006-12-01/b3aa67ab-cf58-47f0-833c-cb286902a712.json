Talks between BA and unions over plugging the \u00a32.1bn hole in the company's pension fund broke up last month. BA has reached a deal with trustees, but the threat of industrial action looms if unions reject changes to pension benefits including later retirement. The four trade unions that represent the bulk of BA's 45,000 staff will meet the airline on Thursday with recommendations that, they say, will make the BA proposal acceptable. Dan Milmo Co-op pays out \u00a313m divi as profits rise The Co-operative Group is to give \u00a3450,000 to community projects after announcing an interim dividend of \u00a313m. Its new-look membership scheme allows members to donate a share of profits to community schemes. The \u00a313m will be distributed among 1.4 million members, with just under half choosing to donate part of the pay-out. Chief executive, Martin Beaumont, said: \"As well as members gaining from the profit-share, it will make a real difference to good causes serving our local communities.\" The pay-out comes after the Co-op posted a 32% increase in first-half profits. Dan Milmo Asking prices for houses rise by 13% over last year The average asking price for a house in England and Wales has jumped by 13% over the last year, according to new figures from Rightmove. The property website's House Price Index for December found the typical sum sellers are asking for is \u00a3221,751 - down 0.3% compared with November. Sellers putting their property on the market in the run up to Christmas are usually highly motivated and price houses to appeal to festively-distracted buyers. Despite the month on month dip the annual inflation rate increased from 12.4% in November to 13%, the highest for more than two years. Press Association Poor outlook for TV advertising growth Carat, the media buyer owned by Aegis, has raised its 2006 spending forecasts for the global advertising market. But it has slashed estimates for the troubled UK sector because of the dire performance of TV. Carat reckons the global market will grow by 6% this year and by 5.8% next year, due to strength in the Asia Pacific region and strong online spending. But in Europe it expects just 4.4% growth this year, down from an initial projection of 4.5%. Carat now predicts UK growth will slump to 1% in 2006, compared with a June forecast of 3.2%, well down on last year's 5.5%. Richard Wray Trinity Mirror to give verdict on break-up Trinity Mirror will unveil the results of its four-month strategic review on Thursday with shareholders likely to call for a break-up of the company. However, some on the board are seemingly reluctant to split the owner of the Mirror and the People from its regional newspaper operations. Following a board meeting on Wednesday, the company will update the market. If Trinity Mirror does opt for a break-up, companies, including Johnston Press, are likely to be interested in the regional titles. Many, however, think it more likely it will merely sell the Racing Post and some non-core operations. Richard Wray"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
