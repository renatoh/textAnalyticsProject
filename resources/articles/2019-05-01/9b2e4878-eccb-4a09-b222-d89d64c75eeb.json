A week after becoming the national manager, Clarke\u2019s squad for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Belgium was notable for the number of absentees. Such situations were commonplace during the tenure of his predecessor, Alex McLeish. John Fleck has been given dispensation to miss the matches because he is getting married. Steven Fletcher is being rested as he manages ankle issues. Robert Snodgrass and Matt Ritchie remain absent from the Scotland scene but Clarke has been boosted by the availability of Tom Cairney, who it was thought planned to switch allegiance to England. \u201cI think there are conversations to be had on every single one of them,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to close the door on anybody. If it takes two or three conversations and I feel that they are the right people to help the squad, to make the squad better, then I am prepared to keep trying. \u201cHopefully you will see over the time I\u2019m in the job we can get these players to come and play for us. What\u2019s happened before has happened before. There\u2019s nothing I can do about that. It\u2019s my job to speak to these players and try to convince them \u2013not even convince them, make them know they are wanted in Scotland. I think if you make people feel wanted, then they are more likely to come and play for you. \u201cThere\u2019s enough talent in that squad to get results in both games, I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d It has been suggested Clarke should cut off those who have previous for not accepting Scotland calls or routinely invoke Fifa\u2019s five-day rule, under which a national association can prevent a player who rejects a call-up from playing for his club for five days after the fixture. \u201cEvery individual case has to be taken on its own merits,\u201d said the former Kilmarnock manager. \u201cThere is no way you can throw down a blanket \u2018this is what we are going to do and this is the way we will deal with people who don\u2019t come to the squad\u2019. I don\u2019t think that would be right. I think it is always better to have a conversation, speak to the club involved and try to find a reasonable solution.\u201d Clarke said he had only a rough idea as to why the mood regressed under McLeish. \u201cSome of the more senior ones felt after the qualifying campaign under Gordon [Strachan] that they\u2019d been pushed aside a wee bit,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThat\u2019s something we can work on.\u201d The same applies to goalscoring. Clarke\u2019s 27-man squad has a combined tally of 14 international goals, five from defenders. Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Celtic), Liam Kelly (Livingston), David Marshall (Hull City), Jon McLaughlin (Sunderland) Defenders: Michael Devlin (Aberdeen), Stuart Findlay (Kilmarnock), Scott McKenna (Aberdeen), Charlie Mulgrew (Blackburn Rovers), Stephen O\u2019Donnell (Kilmarnock), Liam Palmer (Sheffield Wednesday), Andrew Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Heart of Midlothian), Greg Taylor (Kilmarnock) Midfielders: Stuart Armstrong (Southampton), Tom Cairney (Fulham), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Callum McGregor (Celtic), Kenny McLean (Norwich City), Scott McTominay (Manchester United), Graeme Shinnie (Aberdeen) Forwards: Eamonn Brophy (Kilmarnock), Oliver Burke (Celtic, on loan from West Brom), James Forrest (Celtic), Ryan Fraser (Bournemouth), Marc McNulty (Hibernian, on loan from Reading), Lewis Morgan (Sunderland, on loan from Celtic), Johnny Russell (Sporting Kansas City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
