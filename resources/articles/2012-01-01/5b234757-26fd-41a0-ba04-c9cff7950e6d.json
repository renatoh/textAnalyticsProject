But on Wednesday the faces of some of the game's leading players will become more familiar to anyone who has the misfortune to spend a large chunk of their time on UK motorways, as a fleet of Eddie Stobart lorries rumble along the M62 from their Widnes base to Old Trafford to launch a controversial new sponsorship deal, and the 17th Super League season. Anyone stuck behind a smiling Sam Tomkins or Kevin Sinfield might briefly wonder if this is a strange new form of fuel protest, and Castleford are so short of players they might consider asking the former Great Britain prop Dean \"Diesel\" Sampson to come out of retirement. But the Super League clubs who voted 9-5 to accept the Stobart deal, which does not involve any hard cash, ahead of an alternative offer from Betfair coming in at around \u00a3750,000 per year should be congratulated for having the vision to allow the sport to enjoy a rare spell on the moral high ground. The winter's major controversy \u2013 Hull's cover-up of a positive drug test for the former Great Britain centre Martin Gleeson last season \u2013 provided a reminder of Gleeson's previous spell in the headlines and the dangers of aligning too closely with the sports-betting business. Gleeson and Sean Long, the mostly lovable rogue who has made an intriguing switch from poacher to gamekeeper by joining the coaching staff at Salford \u2013 literally in his case, as he used to make night raids on the fields of south-west Lancashire as a lad, looking for rabbits with his father \u2013 used Stan James rather than Betfair when they bet against their own St Helens team in a game at Bradford on Easter Monday 2001. By choosing Stobart over Betfair, the clubs have gained access to marketing exposure worth up to \u00a32.5m per year, according to professional experts, in exchange for less than \u00a350,000 each in cash \u2013 the cost of a jobbing overseas player. There are plenty of those around already, with the usual bunch of unlikely and undistinguished imports joining the clubs who have tended to occupy Super League's lower reaches as they scramble to strengthen their squads sufficiently to challenge for a play-off place. But there are some attractive additions, too, especially at the top end of the table, as fears that the growing financial strength of the National Rugby League and the Australian dollar would prevent any high-calibre overseas signings have so far proved alarmist, with nine former NRL Grand Finalists on the move. Warrington, who finished top of the table, for the first time, in 2011 only to be denied a first Grand Final appearance by Leeds, have signed Trent Waterhouse, a tall ball-playing forward who played five times for Australia, and 12 for New South Wales. St Helens, for whom the pain of a fifth consecutive Grand Final defeat last autumn has given way to excitement about a new era in their stylish new Langtree Park stadium \u2013 complete with a halo-shaped roof \u2013 have bolstered their backs with the experienced New Zealander Lance Hohaia, and their pack with the tough Australian Anthony Laffranchi. They should be the early pacesetters, despite the loss of their irreplaceable captain James Graham to the Canterbury Bulldogs in Sydney, with Warrington, Wigan, the champions, Leeds, and possibly the Catalan Dragons the most likely challengers as the season goes on. Even battling Wakefield Trinity have signed Steve Southern, a nuggety second-row from Newcastle Knights although his Grand Final appearance came with the North Queensland Cowboys back in 2005. Southern and Trinity will open the Stobart Super League at the Stobart Stadium in Widnes on Friday night as the Cheshire club, who have been backed for a while by the pukka truckers, have been awarded the first televised fixture of Sky's new five-year deal to mark their return to the elite after a six-year absence. But the most eye-catching recruitment has been carried out further south. London Broncos have not only been rebranded, after six seasons as Harlequins, but also refinanced, and their dozen new signings include five former NRL Grand Finalists \u2013 Michael Robertson and Shane Rodney, who were both members of the Manly team who beat Hohaia's New Zealand Warriors last September, plus Antonio Kaufusi, Mark Bryant and most intriguingly Craig Gower, an Australia tourist as far back as 1997 who returns to league after four years in rugby union in which he won 13 caps for Italy. The reborn Broncos take on Saints at The Stoop next Saturday afternoon in one of the highlights of the opening round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
