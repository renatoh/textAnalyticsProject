It describes \"door bolt\" defending, in which a team plays with four man markers and a sweeper in the hope of grinding out a 1-0 win. Catatonia, by way of contrast, were a popular Welsh guitar band fronted by the diminutive Cerys Mathews, with Mark Roberts and Owen Powell on guitars and Aled Richards as thub-thumper. Preamble: The teams emerge from the tunnel, line up, cue: music, handshakes ... blah-de-blah etc. As Inter are the designated home side tonight, any score draw would result in AC Milan going through on the away goals rule. A scoreless draw will result in extra time. For Inter, Messrs Toldo, Cannavaro, Materazzi and Di Bagio are all one yellow card away from missing the final, while Andrea Pirlo is the only Milan player who needs to worry unduly about where he puts his boot. 1 min: Inter kick-off. Pirlo goes on a sortie into the Inter box and Materazzi makes a crucial clearance before he can poke the ball goalwards. 2 mins: Milan are doing most of the probing early doors but the Inter defence is holding firm, with several stout tackles and blocks coming in from Materazzi and Zanetti. Shevchenko wins the first corner of the match for Milan. 4 mins: Two Milan corners in quick succession yield only a free-out for Inter. the offence: pushing in the box. 5 mins: Fabio Cannavaro and Andriy Shevchenko jump for a high ball and the Ukraine man goes down holding his head after getting an accidental-on-purpose elbow from the Italian. The ref gives Cannavaro a ticking-off but keeps his cards in his pocket. As I already explained in my comprehensive and not-at-all hastily-put-together preamble, a booking would rule Cannavaro out of the final were Inter to go through. Such an outcome is unlikely, however, as I've poxed them by backing them to win this match. 8 mins: Gattuso goes down under a \"sturdy\" tackle from Di Biagio, who is also on a yellow card. Once again, the referee makes do with a bit of a rollicking. 10 mins: \"What's a free-out (four mins)?\" enquires Gavin Roy. Hold on there Gavin while I spoon-feed you, lest you should have to trouble your common sense or powers of deduction to figure anything out for yourself. Afterall, it's not as if I'm busy or anyting. A free-out is a free-kick awarded to the defending team in their own penalty area. It's a GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) term, borrowed from the noble sport of hurling (men with sticks in the Guinness ad) and not so noble sport of Gaelic Football (like rugby, except more violent). Hernan Crespo shins the first shot of the match for Inter from distance, but doesn't trouble Christian Abbiati in the Milan goal. 14 mins: Emre goes down injured and the ball is put out of play so that he can receive treatment. It's the most exciting thing to have happened in the opening 15 minutes. 16 mins: \"I'm watching this on TV and couldn't help but notice the alarming similarity between Alvaro Recoba and a debauched, saggy-faced ten year old Al Pacino,\" writes Stephen Osmond. Meanwhile in the San Siro, Filippo Inzaghi gets caught offside for the second time in about 30 seconds. This is all shaping up to be an identical match to last week's encounter. Must we fling these scoreless stalemates at our pop-kids? 20 mins: Rui Costa gets the ball in a very promising position in the Inter box and dithers over what to do with it for so long that he's eventually shepherded out to the corner flag, where he promptly falls on his backside. With the ball gone, Materazzi (who is on a yellow card, remember) sprints over to him and needlessly kicks him. Whatever about their footballing nous, I'm thinking few of these Inter players are overburdened with intelligence. 23 mins: Shevchenko takes a high ball on the run on the right hand side of the Inter penalty area and shoots across the face of the Inter goal. Close but - like Phil Tufnell late at night in a steamy Australian jungle - no cigar(ette). 25 mins: A debauched, saggy-faced ten year old Al Pacino pelts down the left wing and is duly dispossessed by an excellent no-nonsense tackle from Alessandro Nesta. 27 mins: Gavin Roy (10 mins) is back and he's not one bit happy: \"I'm sorry, but why use a GAA term for a football game and then chastise poor Yanks for using American terminology (like \"pool play\" last week). Surely you have to be slightly consistent,\" he says, blissfully unaware of the fact that I'm writing this report and can be as inconsistent as I like. Inzaghi appeals for a penalty for hand-ball by Materazzi but gets nothing. Alternatively, he may have been sticking his arm up to signal himself offside, thus saving the Inter defence the trouble. 31 mins: \"A little more circumspection, please,\" writes David Scott (FAQs), who like Gavin Roy is unhappy with my use of GAA terms. If you boys don't stop whingeing I'll start using GAA terminology like \"mullocking\", \"puck-outs\" and \"45s\". Alternatively, I'll start typing in Irish and we'll see how you like that, smart boys. Anything to liven up this excruciating match. Sergio Conceicao goes down injured and is stretchered off for treatment. 35 mins: Alessandro Costacurta crosses from the right wing, but Francesco Toldo plucks the ball safely from the air. 37 mins: Like a border collie on One Man And His Dog, Cordoba shepherds a limp shot back to Toldo. Inzaghi attempts to nip in between them and is forced to hurdle the Inter 'keeper who beats him to the ball. Handbags ensue between the trio and Inzaghi gets booked for no apparent reason. In the ensuing argument with the referee, Milan's Gennaro Gattuso also gets booked. 39 mins: Rui Costa goes into the book for a foul on Javier Zanetti. There's been one other card brandished in the last couple of minutes, but there appears to be confusion over who was on the receiving end. The TV caption says Luigi Di Biagio (which would put him out of the final), but the referee appeared to wave it in the direction of Cristiano Zanetti. 42 mins: Andrea Pirlo fouls Emre but doesn't get booked. In the last 10 minutes, an already dull encounter has been made even more tedious by the apparent desire of both teams to kick lumps out of each other rather than play any football. 44 mins: \"Are you sure you didn't use to write for Smash Hits?\" asks Alison Jeeves, who appears to be mixing me up with dim-witted journalistic lightweight Kate Thornton. (It goes without saying that my mantelpiece is groaning under the weight of all the shiny gongs I've won for my quality prose - 10 Pulitzers and counting.) 45 mins: GOAL!!! Inter 0 - 1 AC Milan Andriy Shevchenko latches on to a through-ball from Seedorf in the Inter box, rounds Cordoba (who has a little kick at him in the process) and then does brilliantly to ignore the advances of the onrushing Toldo and lift it over the goalkeeper into the roof of the Inter goal. Game on! Remember that that strike counts as an away goal, so Inter need to score twice to go through to the final. Typically high-browed half-time discussion Special thanks to Tony Somers who has reminded me of a few more GAA terms that I plan to drop into the second half commentary to confuse yanks even more than they are already. I'll mark them with an asterisk*, just so you'll know when to get annoyed. \"Never mind all that Al Pacino shite,\" scoffs Russell Brady in a manner that can only be described as profane. \"Gattuso looks like the hunch-back dwarf from the film adaptation of The Name of the Rose. He was Italian as well you know.\" \"Is the game looking like a Serie A match?\" enquires Peter Donley from San Francisco. Well let's see Peter - it's being played in Italy, it features two Serie A teams in a massive stadium packed full of baying Italians ... OF COURSE IT'S LOOKING LIKE A SERIE A MATCH!!!!! 46 mins: Inter kick-off, with Martins (18-year-old Nigerian striker) and Dalmat (French midfielder) coming on as substitutes for Recoba and Di Biagio. Dalmat is gone out on the right, with Conceicao switching to the left. Could it be possible that a Hector Cuper team are going to play four (count 'em!) up front? Eh no. 48 mins: Alison Jeeves (44 mins) is back: \"I'm not mistaking you for Kate Thornton as I haven't seen you on any I Am Prepared To Say That I Love Anything You Want Just To Get On TV! style programmes.\" Conceicao atempts to cross from the left but his effort is blocked. Meanwhile, I start wittering on about how much I love Spangles and what great fun Space Hoppers were. 50 mins: From the narrowest of angles, Shevchenko attempts to cross into the Inter box, but his delivery is too high for Pippo Inzaghi. 51 mins: \"By the way,\" adds Alison Jeeves. \"feel free to come down to the Carling Apollo in Hammersmith, where I am Box Office manager, and collect free tickets for anything you like whenever you like.\" Actually she doesn't, but now that I have fabricated documentary evidence to the contrary, it would be very mealy-mouthed of her not to let me in to see the film of my choice free of charge at least once. Javier Zanetti has a pop from distance but the ball ends up nestling safely in Christian Abbiati's bread-basket. 55 mins: Emre plays a cross-field ball from left to right. I'm not sure why I mentioned it as it was nothing special, but I have to write something and there's not much going on in the match. 56 mins: Inter win a free-kick to the left of the D about three or four yards outside the Milan box. Materazzi takes it, slips in his run-up and falls on his arse. Quality. 58 mins: All the pressure in the second half is coming from Inter, who are relying on Conceicao crosses from the left to provide ammo for their stirkers. Martins wins a corner which Abbiati punches clear. 61 mins: A sloppy clearance from Materazzi enables Rui Costa to tee up Shevchenko on the left-hand side of the Inter box. Without breaking stride he has a pop that goes high, high thar an trasnan*. 62 mins: Inter win a free-kick right on the right-hand side of the Milan box. Emre whips it in, the ball stings the palms of Abbiati and under pressure from Shevchenko, Conceicao blasts the rebound wide as a ditch. AC Milan substitution: Rui Costa goes off to be replaced by Ambrosini, who I know nothing about. 65 mins: Inter win a free-kick just outside the Milan box, straight in front of goal. Emre Heskeys it over the bar. 66 mins: \"Is it too late to mention how thrilled I am that Man Utd won the Premiership?\" enquires Alan Kirkup in Arkansas. Unfortunately it is, Alan. To be honest I think you'd be better off sitting on your porch wondering why it is you haven't got opposable thumbs. 69 mins: Kallon replaces Crespo on the Inter side. Brilliant tactics by Hector Cuper - bring off your best scorer in a match where you need two goals. 71 mins: \"The Italian for 'attacker' is 'attacante' which, if pronounced correctly, is probably what the Inter fans are calling Cuper right now,\" writes cunning linguist David Scott. Inter win a corner which Abbiati tips over the bar. Javier Zanetti loops the ensuing inswinger over the bar and Milan get a goal-kick. 74 mins: All the pressure is coming from Inter, as you would expect, but while they're giving Milan's defenders plenty to think about, they don't really look like scoring. 75 mins: Cannavaro robs Pippo Inzaghi with a brilliant sliding tackle. The Milan striker goes down like he's been shot in the back, despite the fact that replays prove conclusively there wasn't a hint of physical contact between the players. 77 mins: AC Milan substitution: Serginho for Inzaghi. Also, my thanks to Gavin Roy who has been mailing me again to (a) correct my spellings and (b) insist that he isn't a yank. To be honest, Gavin, whatever your nationality I think you should go out and communicate with some people face-to-face. Otherwise you'll end up suffering a constant world of cyber-torment like me and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Materazzi concedes a free-kick on the edge of his own box after kicking Shevchenko perilously close to his goolies. Serginho whips the free-kick wide. 82 mins: GOAL!!!: Inter 1 - 1 AC Milan Inter equalise through Martins, the Nigerian youngster, who takes the ball on the edge of the Milan box, leaves Maldini in his dust and coolly slots the ball low past Toldo. He then embarks on an exhibition of somersaults and backflips that would put Newcastle's Romana LuaLua to shame. It's one apiece, but as it stands, Milan will go through on away goals. 86 mins: Inter almost get the goal they need when Kallon skins both Maldini and Nesta and shoots across the face of Milan's goal. Inter win a corner which Conceicao takes. Abbiati spills it and the ball returns to Conceicao. He pumps in another cross and somebody - didn't see who - plants a header just wide of the back stick. Brocchi replaces Pirlo on the Milan side. 89 mins: Milan are defnding frantically, but ease the pressure considerably by winning a free-kick inside the Inter half. Cordoba wins the ball back and hoofs it out for a sideline cut*. 90 mins: There'll be two minutes of additional time. Inter's keeper wellies the ball down the field. Route one. 90 + 1 mins: Inter win a corner kick. Toldo runs the length of the field and fouls his opposite number in the Milan goal. There's no free-kick awarded, though. 90 + 2 mins: The corner is swung in and Abbiati punches it clear. The referee blows his whistle for full time and Milan are through to their ninth Champions League final. Right, that's me done and dusted.
