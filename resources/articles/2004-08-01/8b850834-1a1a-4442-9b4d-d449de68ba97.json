Grimsby, struggling in League Two, inflicted Wigan's first defeat of term by 1-0 thanks to a 17th-minute strike from Andy Parkinson. Brighton suffered their fourth defeat in five games in 18 days when they lost 2-1 at home to League Two's reviving Bristol Rovers . Brighton grabbed an 11th-minute lead through Guy Butters but were then undermined by two goals in five minutes from Lee Thorpe and Richard Walker. Other Championship failures included Stoke City, Derby and Gillingham. Stoke led 1-0 at Oldham but collapsed to a 2-1 defeat after the expulsion of defender Wayne Thomas while Derby took the lead at Lincoln through Spanish midfielder Inigo Idiakez before losing 3-1. Gillingham went down 2-1 at home to Northampton of League Two despite a late fightback inspired by a 56th-minute goal from the Mali striker, Mamade Sidibe. More fortunate were the travelling fans of Burnley who saw a 3-2 win at Bury delivered on a two-goal foundation laid down by Robbie Blake. A late goal from Tommy Miller edged Ipswich to victory over Brentford while two first-half goals from Steve Jones brought Crewe an easy 4-1 win at home to Blackpool . A late goal from Kevin Gallen sealed Queens Park Rangers' 3-0 win over Swansea. Sunderland won by a similar margin over League Two stragglers, Chester."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
