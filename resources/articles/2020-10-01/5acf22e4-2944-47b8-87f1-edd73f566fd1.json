It doesn\u2019t necessarily make the next game easier, you still have to approach it in the right way.\u201d Klopp knows he is not alone this season in being on the wrong end of an embarrassing scoreline. Both Manchester clubs have conceded five or more in unexpected defeats and the Liverpool manager is among those tempted to believe empty stadiums may be part of the reason for the rush of goals. Players accustomed to performing in front of large crowds, the theory goes, are not quite as switched-on without them. Subconsciously or otherwise, they find it hard to achieve the same level of concentration. \u201cThere have been some crazy scores and it looks like that could be the reason,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cNothing else has changed but I don\u2019t want to use it as an excuse. In our last match one team scored seven goals and the other only two, so if the absence of fans in the stadium is to blame it seems only one side suffered from it.\u201d While Liverpool expect to have Sadio Man\u00e9 and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara back in contention after a period of Covid-19 enforced quarantine, Naby Ke\u00efta is self-isolating and Alisson will miss the derby with a shoulder injury. Klopp has overseen seven wins and four draws in his 11 derbies, though he acknowledges Everton will present a tough challenge. \u201cWe always respect them but this season they look especially good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be in the opposite dugout to see that Carlo [Ancelotti] is a sensational manager and that Everton have done some good transfer business.\u201d On Friday Liverpool sent three players on loan to EFL clubs: Harvey Elliott to Blackburn, Harry Wilson to Cardiff and Ben Woodburn to Blackpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
