While they have won Triple Crowns, three in the past five seasons, they have never held the Six Nations title. Ireland should have beaten the host nation, Australia, in the 2003 World Cup, and who knows what they might have accomplished then? But they did not and time is now running out for Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara and the Munster lads up front, who are no longer so laddish, to claim their reward. One of them, John Hayes, would never place himself at the centre of anything, let alone a gilded group, but the quiet man of Bruff, County Limerick, is this week their totem. The prop will win his 90th cap against France, though at the age of 35 he has possibly passed the halfway mark of his collection. And there lies the second rub for the legacy of Ireland's golden boys. They were a small group thinly spread and, once they were gone, what would follow? On two scores there is reason to be hopeful. First, the old set still has a lustre, born of the ongoing exploits of Munster in Europe. And nobody will be concentrating harder on the French front five and convinced that there may be pickings to be had at the scrum and lineout than the experienced Hayes. Ireland had a terrible World Cup in 2007, a disappointing Six Nations in 2008 and failed to raise themselves to lukewarm against the All Blacks when they visited Croke Park in November. They rallied slightly to go toe to toe with Argentina at the end of November but shortly afterwards Munster lost the plot in the Magners League, losing in Connacht and then at home to Ulster. However, the team then pulled themselves together to beat the Ospreys away in the Magners League and give Sale a rare going over at Thomond Park in the Heineken Cup before completing their qualification for that competition's quarter-finals with a clinical win at Montauban. If they cannot tell the difference between the past month for Munster and the past two years for Ireland, then there is no point turning up now. Paul O'Connell, restored to good health, will be issuing a few reminders of the gulf between the good and the bad, although it is unlikely he will have the immodesty to point to himself. Still, it is true. When O'Connell is going well, he carries Ireland with him. Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is one of two non-Munstermen in the pack, the other being Ulster's Stephen Ferris. When asked about the pressure on Heaslip to keep his spot in the side from another Munster player, Denis Leamy, the Ireland coach, Declan Kidney, said: \"Everyone wants a little competition for their places. All good players respond to that.\" It applies to the No8, too young to be of the golden generation, but equally to those very players who once had their positions all to themselves. Herein lies the team's second boon: Ireland have reason to be hopeful because young players have emerged. In, for example, come Luke Fitzgerald on the wing, Rob Kearney, ankle injury permitting, at full-back. Out go Girvan Dempsey and Shane Horgan. On to the bench go Geordan Murphy, Peter Stringer and Gordon D'Arcy, five players with 327 caps between them. To shift them requires powerful green shoots. The strongest may be Tomas O'Leary at scrum-half. As a bundle of involvement, in tackles and catching, he could not be more industrious, yet he seems to do everything on his own terms, with control and an eye for others. Stringer has done nothing wrong; he just loses his place to a younger player in outstanding form. The old and the new will be connected by O'Connell up front. And by Paddy Wallace at inside centre, reunited with Brian O'Driscoll with whom he played in the Under-19 World Cup final in 1998 and with whom he toured in New Zealand and Australia last summer. \"One of the pluses with Paddy,\" said O'Driscoll, \"is he's a great distributor. He's a real creator.\" Kidney talked of the quality of \"dovetailing\" in midfield. That is delicate carpentry which shapes a touch of the old and the new with somebody in between \u2013 Wallace is 29 \u2013 in the middle. The new-ish Ireland is not golden yet but not open to barbs either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
