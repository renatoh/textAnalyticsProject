It's up to the Swedish Academy to whom its money goes, but a resignation might be called for. Not by Americans, but by the rest of the world, whom US writers have so long entertained and enlightened. Since its beginnings, American writing has been in dialogue with other literatures. This has happened in parallel with its chronicling of the unfolding drama of the US itself, exactly because that country has enjoyed such a vast and varied influx of immigrants. From the start there was export, too. Whole genres have come out of the States. Detective fiction could not have existed without Edgar Allan Poe. Modernist poetry would have been much the poorer without Eliot and Pound. In our own times, Americans have continued to lead the way, exerting beneficial influence. To take one example: it is impossible that Martin Amis could have written his books as he has without those of Saul Bellow as a template. Today, authors such as Don DeLillo and Philip Roth are towering figures, globally respected without consideration of nationality. Writers such as Richard Powers and the late David Foster Wallace have shown the path to a newer generation of writers for whom all national boundaries are quaint curiosities. As for the idea that American writers themselves are insular and overly subject to mass-culture trends, one only has to look at What Is the What, a recent novel about a Sudanese refugee by Dave Eggers, to know that's not the way things are going. They never were. The proper response to Engdahl is a word conceived in America but universally understood: bullshit. \u2022 Giles Foden is a novelist and professor of creative writing at the University of East Anglia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
