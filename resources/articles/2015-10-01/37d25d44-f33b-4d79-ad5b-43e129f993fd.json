Chris King, taking over as chair of the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference (HMC), whose members include Eton and Westminster, defends private schools as \u201cthe only truly independent schools\u201d in contrast to state-run schools. In his inaugural address to the HMC\u2019s annual meeting in St Andrews on Tuesday, King will tell his audience: \u201cI say to our critics: stop the politically charged, sterile rhetoric which gets us nowhere. Stop indulging in toffism and out-of-date preconceptions about the nature of our schools. \u201cAbove all, stop believing that you can make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker. Instead of carping, accept we want to make a positive contribution.\u201d King \u2013 the head of Leicester grammar school, which charges fees of \u00a34,000 per term \u2013 will tell his colleagues that they are \u201ccrucial to the country\u2019s future success\u201d. \u201cIt is clearly absurd to blame the sector which educates 7% of the school population for the ills of the educational experience of the other 93%. This seems to me to be a distraction tactic, steering the debate away from serious and long-term issues such as funding crises and teacher shortages,\u201d he will tell delegates, according to extracts released by the HMC. The 275 HMC schools educate 215,000 of the 625,000 pupils at independent schools in the UK, and its members are a roll-call of some of the most famous names in education, including Roedean, Fettes and Manchester Grammar. King will also make a detailed assault on the UK examination system, deriding examination boards as a \u201ccottage industry\u201d and criticising erratic exam marking as harming schools and pupils. \u201cThe current situation is untenable. We are facing a perfect storm, of both decreasing public confidence and increasing pressure in the system,\u201d King will say, echoing criticisms by state school heads and unions. The conference is to call for improvements in setting and marking exams, a larger and better trained pool of markers, and a transparent appeals process. The Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents the exam boards, rebuffed King\u2019s comments, noting that the 70,000 successful appeals against GCSE and A-level grades equated to just 1% of entries last year. \u201cOur examination system relies upon the 50,000 teachers who each year mark over 15 million papers. They do a fantastic job and receive training from exam boards and ongoing monitoring to ensure high standards are maintained,\u201d said Michael Turner, the JCQ\u2019s director general. The Department for Education said the exam regulator Ofqual was taking steps to improve the quality of marking. \u201cOur new GCSEs and A-levels will be gold-standard qualifications that match the best in the world,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said. HMC heads are to join state sector representatives and the exam boards in a new expert group to look at marking problems. King\u2019s remarks also include a criticism of the government\u2019s expansion of academies and free schools outside local authority control in England, saying they are \u201ccertainly not\u201d similar to private schools. \u201cIncreasingly the term \u2018independent state school\u2019 is coming into use \u2013 it is, however, an oxymoron. How is a state academy truly independent when, through Ofsted and performance tables, the government can set most of the curriculum? \u201cIt is often forgotten, for example, that the reason we charge fees is precisely so we can remain independent,\u201d King will say. A recent survey of independent schools found that the average fee for day pupils is around \u00a312,000 a year. State-run schools \u2013 including academies and free schools \u2013 receive on average less than \u00a36,000 per pupil in England and Wales, although the amount varies by local authority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
