A float pencilled in for June could so easily be derailed by a plunging stock market if the European sovereign debt crisis spirals out of control, imperilling the future of the single currency. But 50-year-old Bonham Carter is determined to brave the elements in a move that could trigger a \u00a3500m windfall for staff, who own 80% of the company. Never mind that shares in another fund manager, Gartmore, which floated at the end of last year, are trading below their offer price or that other companies pulled listing plans amid market turmoil. One analyst says: \"I think this is a gutsy move, but not without potential downside. Reputations are at stake, there is a lot riding on this one.\" Bonham Carter is certainly no ordinary fund manager, coming from a family of high achievers, spanning politics and finance. His great-grandfather was Lord Asquith, the Liberal prime minister whose daughter was the indomitable Lady Violet Bonham Carter, and whose film director son, Anthony, made The Yellow Rolls-Royce. One of Edward's uncles was a governor of the BBC, and his aunt Laura was married to former Liberal leader Jo Grimond. A great-aunt was Baron de Rothschild's wife. His own wife, travel journalist Victoria, was a presenter on TV programmes Wish you Were Here and The Holiday Programme. A year ago, his grandfather, Don Eduardo Propper de Callej\u00f3n, was posthumously awarded the Israeli title \"Righteous among the Nations\" for helping save hundreds of Jews in the second world war. Friends of Bonham Carter describe him as a puzzling blend of charm and restrained pugnacity, but \"bloody good at his job\". His Undervalued Assets fund, which he ran between 2000 and 2009, achieved a return of about 16% against a fall of 9.47% for the FTSE-All Share. He was rated the 16th-best fund manager in the country out of a tally of 191. Baffled During the past 10 years, Jupiter has never experienced a single quarter when there has been a net outflow of funds in its UK retail business, which invests predominantly in unit trusts. The company says that of the 32 investment funds Jupiter manages, 25 have outperformed the majority of their peers since launch. But why float in such an uncertain climate? Announcing the company's plans, Bonham Carter said: \"Jupiter has flourished over recent years, despite the challenges of the financial crisis. We have a robust investment culture and a well established brand.\" Even so, his decision has baffled observers. There is a suspicion that the company wants a listing because it would make it easier to value, which in turn would pave the way for Jupiter to be gobbled up by a larger rival. If that happened, staff could expect another huge windfall as they will retain a 50% stake after flotation. The immediate goal is that Bonham Carter wants to reduce debt by redeeming a tranche of preference shares that pay out a 10% coupon and are held, in the main, by TA Associates. TA is the private equity business which backed Jupiter's buy-out from Commerzbank three years ago in a deal that valued the fund manager at \u00a3740m. Redeeming those shares would simplify Jupiter's capital structure and preserve cash that could be used to expand the business. A public listing, which is expected to raise between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m, would also enable the company to award shares to its top fund managers, who include Tony Nutt, Philip Gibbs and John Chatfield-Roberts. What better way to retain talent in a fiercely competitive marketplace? Proceeds could also be used to attract \"star\" managers and trim bank debt. Buyout Born in 1960, Bonham Carter attended Harrow school and Manchester University, where he read politics. His mother was a psychotherapist and his father was head of banking at SG Warburg before being paralysed by a brain tumour in 1978. Bonham Carter initially looked outside the City for employment. Kenco offered him a job marketing coffee, Procter &amp; Gamble wanted him to sell Zest soap, and oil companies gave him interviews. His father persuaded him not to shun finance just because he was in it and Bonham Carter ended up at Schroders in 1982. He wanted to be a corporate financier but concedes that he is better suited to fund management. He specialised in US shares then spent from 1986 to 1994 at Electra Investment Trust before being lured to Jupiter, which John Duffield had established in 1985. Commerzbank bought Jupiter for about \u00a3680m between 1995 and 2000 but its ownership was marked by a series of rows between Duffield and his German employer. Duffield famously exited, calling the management Nazis and labelling his three German superiors Hitler, Himmler and Goering. Not surprisingly, Commerzbank sacked him and Duffield then sued the bank for wrongful dismissal. But the upshot was that Bonham Carter was put in charge of Jupiter and engineered the buyout from the German bank, setting it on a course that \u2013 market conditions permitting \u2013 will see it re-list on the stock market after a gap of 15 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
