Rio Ferdinand is also missing because of a hamstring injury, a fact which, some may feel, made it especially important for Campbell to get an England game behind him given the possibility of his international experience being needed for the crucial, climactic World Cup qualifier against Germany in Munich in three weeks' time. Be that as it may, Campbell has not been recalled because, as Eriksson pointed out after announcing a 26-man squad, the centre-back has been out of action for four months since suffering an ankle injury during Tottenham's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Old Trafford in April. In the meantime Campbell has moved three miles down the road from Spurs to Highbury, a fact which for Spurs fans would have made him about as welcome at White Hart Lane on Wednesday as Alan Sugar on a nostalgia trip. Yet, if the prospect of Eriksson's team taking the field to a chorus of abuse had ever occurred to him, the England coach was not letting on. \"I talked both to Sol and to Arsene Wenger [the Arsenal manager] and together we decided that it would be better at this time for Campbell to work on getting himself fit,\" he explained. \"A player of his physical stature needs to be fully fit to play at his best and the fact that he is not 100% fit at the moment is the only reason he will not be playing.\" Should Campbell fail to appear in Wenger's back four at Middlesbrough a week today and then be vilified on returning to Spurs for a Premier League fixture in mid-November, Eriksson will feel doubly vindicated in leaving him out now. The same will apply if Seaman has an outstanding match in Munich. Yesterday the England coach strove to quell speculation about Seaman's international future when his 38th birthday is less than six weeks away. \"Seaman will be back for the match against Germany,\" Eriksson said, presumably in the fervent hope that the Arsenal man will not again be caught napping by the sort of speculative 35-yard shot with which Dietmar Hamann won last October's World Cup qualifier for the Germans at Wembley, precipitating Kevin Keegan's resignation as England coach. Since taking over the squad Eriksson has restored public confidence in the team and, more importantly, the team's confidence in itself. Five successive victories represent the best start made by the national side under any of its 10 coaches and the main purpose of the Holland game will be to pick up the thread of success after the composed, disciplined 2-0 win over Greece in Athens two months ago strengthened the belief that England can, after all, reach next summer's tournament. To do so they will probably have to negotiate a play-off in November. Germany's Wembley win has almost certainly seen to that, which makes it imperative that Eriksson gets as many of his first choices into action on Wednesday before a generous sprinkling of substitutions. The absence of Seaman and Ferdinand will make it impossible for England to start with the team which began in Athens. And injuries to Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard could force changes elsewhere. If Fowler is out, Andy Cole, suspended against Greece, may get back. Otherwise Emile Heskey could join Michael Owen in the centre of the attack, with Nick Barmby returning on the left. Steve McManaman is not in the squad because Real Madrid have only just started pre-season training. Most critics are keen to see how Owen Hargreaves shapes up in midfield. The 20-year-old Canadian, of English and Welsh parentage but with a football career shaped by the Bundesliga, appears certain to win his first full England cap, if only to satisfy the coach's curiosity. Eriksson, already impressed by the youngster's performances for Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League, watched the midfielder against Borussia Monchengladbach in Bayern's first league game of the season and said he was \"the best player on the pitch\", adding yesterday: \"I am curious and interested to see him at closer quarters. He has a lot of qualities. He is very fit and he can run a lot. He is a good winner of the ball and has good ability when he is in possession.\" The Football Association is to provide a flight back to Manchester for the northern-based England players after the Holland match. It is understood to be the first time the FA has provided a plane to transport players back to their clubs immediately after a home game. Possible starting line-up: Martyn; G Neville, Keown, Southgate, Ashley Cole; Beckham, Gerrard, Scholes, Heskey (or Barmby); Andy Cole (or Heskey), Owen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
