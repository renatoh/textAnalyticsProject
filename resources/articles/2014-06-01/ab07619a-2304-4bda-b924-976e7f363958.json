In time, those scars will heal but not yet. It is only four years since the farce of South Africa, when Raymond Domenech lost control of his mutinous players and they refused to leave the team bus for training after Nicolas Anelka had been sent home. The memories are still raw. France, who played Paraguay in a friendly in Nice on Sunday, know that the world will be eagerly waiting for another eruption in Brazil. \u201cIt is always going to be part of the French history,\u201d said Patrick Vieira, who is wary of the challenges facing the current generation but also quietly optimistic about a more harmonious future. \u201cBut since 2010 I think all the people who were around Domenech have changed, so that is part of the past.\u201d Yet the present offers its own difficulties and Didier Deschamps has already had to deal with the fallout of leaving behind one of his best players, Samir Nasri, in the pursuit of team harmony. Yet Vieira, a World Cup winner and European champion alongside Deschamps in 1998 and 2000, and now the head of elite development at Nasri\u2019s club, Manchester City, believes that is less about the individual and more about the structural problems that have plagued French football. \u201cIn France it is very difficult,\u201d Vieira, who was speaking at ITV\u2019s World Cup launch, said. \u201cIn France you are talking about Samir, and some of the other players, having personal issues. But Samir never had a problem with Manchester. They talk about Benzema. Benzema never had a problem with Real Madrid. Franck Rib\u00e9ry never had a problem at Bayern Munich. So I think it is the structure that creates that kind of problem. The French national team has to look at itself, how the structure is done. That is not as strong as City, Bayern or Real Madrid. \u201cThe problem is that you need people above who dictate the rules. It is like parents. When you have a kid, who are shown the rules, the kids know where to stand and what to do and what not to do. If there are no rules, people do what they want. The structure in the French national team in the last few years wasn\u2019t the best. \u201cWhen I was playing it was a different structure. Every player knew where they were, what they had to do and how they had to behave. When I was there, the majority of the players had big experience. I think the average age was around 30. This one is younger. In the last few years the French team had been a bit younger. \u201cWhen you are young you need more people around to support you, and I think the players have been let down by the structure around them. \u201cIt has changed because they have a new president, who has been working and changing the manager and people around him. I think the French team is more solid and when you look at what they\u2019ve been doing in the last few games it\u2019s because the structure around is more clear.\u201d Yet Vieira has been critical of the decision to leave Nasri at home. \u201cWhen you are talking about football, you want to choose your best player,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when you are a top manager you should deal with the character of the players.\u201d For all the gnashing of teeth, Vieira is positive about a side that beat Holland convincingly in March and thrashed Norway 4-0 last week. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they are good enough to go to the end and win it, but what it shows is that Deschamps has got the experience, he is a positive leader, and he will prepare the team well,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a potential there, when you look at Rib\u00e9ry, Benzema. It is how they are going to be ready to fight for each other. And I think if Deschamps can get them to think about the same ideas together, they can perform, because there is talent. If Didier makes them gel together they can be a good team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
