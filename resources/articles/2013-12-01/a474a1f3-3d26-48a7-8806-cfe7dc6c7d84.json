He said he was \"strongly upset\" about being spied on and did not know what the intelligence services were after. \"This piece of news follows a series of other revelations which, as we clearly stated in the past, if proven true, are unacceptable and deserve our strongest condemnation,\" said Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen, European Commission spokesperson. \u2022 At his final press conference of the year, US president Barack Obama addressed the White House review panel report on NSA surveillance, which was released on Wednesday. \"I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about this in January,\" Obama said. He also refused to comment on whether he would consider granting NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden amnesty. Snowden has been indicted by the US government. \u2022 The UK executive director of M\u00e9decins du Monde, Leigh Daynes, said he was \"bewildered\" by the latest report. \"If substantiated, snooping on aid workers would be a shameful waste of taxpayers\u2019 money; money that would be better spent vaccinating Syrian children against polio, or rebuilding the Philippines\u2019 shattered health system,\" Daynes said. \u2022 Kenneth Roth, executive director at Human Rights Watch, said: \"No one should be surprised that governments spy on each other, but when they start spying on humanitarian groups, the pretense of counterterrorism is stripped away, and the need for strict limits on these mass invasions of our privacy becomes glaring.\" Author Dave Eggers has written an essay about NSA surveillance: A writer's job is to look for trouble.\" That line was uttered by a character in The Front, the 1976 film about the McCarthy blacklist era. In the film,Woody Allen plays Howard Prince, a small-time bookie who is asked by an old friend, a blacklisted screenwriter, to be a front, signing his name to scripts penned by writers suspected of communist sympathies. Prince agrees, and soon attracts the notice of the House Committee on Un-American Activities himself. Watching the movie now, parallels between that era and our own are many \u2013 the generalised air of suspicion, the pernicious feeling of being watched but not knowing when. But then, so far the government hasn't used any of its metadata (or whatever it's collecting) to ruin any writer. The movie's screenwriter, Walter Bernstein, himself was blacklisted and deprived of work. His phone was tapped, he was followed by FBI agents, his friends were harassed and he was denied a passport. I reached Bernstein, now 94 and still writing, by phone at his home in New York. When the Snowden revelations became public, he was surprised not that there was surveillance, but by the extent of it. \"Then again,\" he said, \"if they're able to do it, they will do it.\" It couldn't be as bad now as it was then, could it? I asked. \"In some ways,\" he said, \"it's worse now. Now the surveillance extends to everyone. And it's going to get worse. The crimes committed in the name of national security are very great, and there's no answer to it. A reporter asked about granting amnesty to the NSA surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden, who has been indicted by the US government. Obama said he had to be careful about answering the question, but would try to get to the \"heart of it.\" \"As I said before, I believe this is an important discussion we've needed to have,\" Obama said. Also , as he said before, he believes the way these disclosures were made was \"damaging\" to the United States. \"It is important to keep in mind that this has created unnecessary damage to US intelligence and US diplomacy,\" he said. The NSA civilian tasked with leading the agency's internal review of the damage caused by Snowden, Rick Ledgett, said last week that he was open to a deal that would grant amnesty to Snowden. \"There's a difference between Mr. Ledgett saying something and the president of the United States saying something,\" Obama said. Responding to reporter questions at the press conference, Obama said that the public debate about government surveillance has changed in the past six months. He insisted that his past statements are in line with what he has said about the NSA before. \"The statements that I made then are entirely consistent with the statements I make now,\" he said. Obama also said that in light of disclosures about government surveillance, the programs might need to be amended. \"Whatever benefits these programs might have may be outweighed by their potential abuse... so there might be another way of skinning the cat.\" \"We may have to refine this further to give people more confidence,\" he said. Before starting a two week vacation in Hawaii, Barack Obama held a year-end press conference on Friday. He spoke about the economy, Affordable Care Act and of course, the White House review panel's report on NSA surveillance. He said he had an extensive meeting with the panel in the situation room and that he would be consulting people in and out of the government to evaluate the panel's recommendations. \"I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about this in January,\" Obama said. \"What is also clear is from the public debate people are concerned about the prospect and possibility of abuse,\" Obama said, adding that he is confident that the NSA is not \"snooping around\" domestically. \"We have to provide more confidence to the international community,\" Obama said, arguing that there are more clear checks and balances in the US for regulating domestic surveillance tactics as opposed to international ones. \"We've had less legal constraint in what we're doing internationally,\" he said. Obama said the virtual world has changed traditional geographic boundaries, but said: \"just because we can do something, doesn't mean we necessarily should.\" US president Barack Obama is due to speak at his final press conference of the year in 10 minutes. He will likely face questions about the White House review panel's report on NSA surveillance that was released on Wednesday. The panel made 46 recommendations in the report, including that the National Security Agency should be stripped of its power to collect telephone records in bulk and that the authority for spying on foreign leaders should be granted at a higher level than at present. Jim Newell is providing updates from Washington DC. It's official, the NSA revelations have inspired a song. The song, and some interactive word puzzles, are included in an extensive Pando Daily story about the history of encryption and the NSA's attempts to thwart it. A sample of the lyrics: It's called encryption Put it in a box add a padlock Only you and the receiver have the key That's called encryption In response to the White House panel review of the NSA, Douglas Alexander, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Labour party in the UK, called for the conservative government to follow Obama and start a wider debate over government surveillance I welcome that President Obama has acknowledged there is need for a debate. His comments reflect widespread concern in the US about the work of the NSA. Of course, the legal and political structures in the US are different from those that we have here in Britain. We have a different system of oversight and accountability. They do not have a system of ministers signing warrants, instead they have a foreign intelligence surveillance court that is not led by elected officials. GCHQ is about a seventh of the size of the NSA and the NSA is, of course, headed by a military commander whilst British agencies are headed by civilians. What I want to see happen now is what Hillary Clinton called for in London back in October \u2013 a more vigorous discussion about what is necessary in terms of oversight and accountability. In the past some politicians may have been satisfied with their assumption that the security services were being held properly accountable. Today it is not enough for oversight to be working effectively, it has also to be seen by the public to be working effectively. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that this standard is being met. The very fact that President Obama has appointed a White House panel to look into these issues is evidence that this debate is already happening in the US. So it is understandable that people here in the UK will want to be reassured that the same is happening here in Britain. That is why Labour has said the government should look at on-going reforms to the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), the principal oversight body examining the work of the agencies. We have already seen improvements to the ISC role and its remit, but we should not be afraid to consider more changes, including the case for example that the chair of the ISC committee always to come from an Opposition party, as is the case with the Public Accounts Committee. I think we should also consider whether the ISC should be empowered to subpoena and to compel witnesses to appear before them as is the case for the other parliament select committees. The power to compel under oath would in effect require witnesses to provide all the relevant documents to the ISC. But Alexander is not seeking that the ISC be required to work in public Kenneth Roth, executive director at Human Rights Watch, has responded to the latest surveillance revelations: No one should be surprised that governments spy on each other, but when they start spying on humanitarian groups, the pretense of counterterrorism is stripped away, and the need for strict limits on these mass invasions of our privacy becomes glaring. The Green MP Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele, who had met Edward Snowden in Moscow in October, told the Guardian: It is increasingly becoming clear that Britain has been more than the US' stooge in this surveillance scandal. It didn't help the NSA to copy cables, but played a large and active role. Great Britain is not just any country \u2013 it is a country that we are supposed to be in a union with. It's incredible for one member of the European Union to spy on another \u2013 it's like members of a family spying on each other. The German government will need to raise this with the British government directly and ask tough questions about the victims \u2013 and that is the right word \u2013 of this affair. In response to the latest revelations of surveillance by US and UK intelligence services on European commission vice-president Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, European Commission spokesperson Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen said: This piece of news follows a series of other revelations which, as we clearly stated in the past, if proven true, are unacceptable and deserve our strongest condemnation. This is not the type of behaviour that we expect from strategic partners, let alone from our own Member States. These issues are already being dealt with through the working groups created with the United States. The Commission has also recently adopted a communication with a number of measures which are needed to restore trust and confidence in the transatlantic relationship. We equally welcome the internal review process that the United States' administration is conducting on its intelligence activities. We trust that this will lead to intelligence collection which is respectful of our democracies and the fundamental rights of our citizens. The Commission will raise these new allegations with US and UK authorities. Leigh Daynes, the UK executive director of the GCHQ and NSA targeted French charity organization M\u00e9decins du Monde (Doctors of the World), said the group was \"bewildered\" by the latest report. If substantiated, snooping on aid workers would be a shameful waste of taxpayers\u2019 money; money that would be better spent vaccinating Syrian children against polio, or rebuilding the Philippines\u2019 shattered health system. Our doctors, nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security. We\u2019re an independent health charity with over 30 years\u2019 experience in delivering impartial care in some of the world\u2019s poorest and most dangerous places. Our medical professionals, many of whom are volunteers, risk their lives daily in countries like Mali and Somalia, and in and around Syria. There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored. We have nothing to hide. Daynes said that like other humanitarian organizations, M\u00e9decins du Monde's role is one of a \"neutral intermediary.\" He said the group was also concerned that the last surveillance revelations could breach doctor-patient confidentiality. \u201cOur aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone. Our aid is never used to further a particular political or religious standpoint. And we have robust anti-fraud and anti-corruption policies and procedures in place,\u201d Daynes said. Eric King, head of research at Privacy International, condemned the spying on aid agencies, in particular: The targeting of the international actors tasked with caring for the most vulnerable people, particularly children, is one of the most distressing revelations yet. How can spying on doctors and charities be critical to protecting our national security? Those who have argued that the actions of our intelligence agencies are justified to prevent terrorism need to take a long hard look at how the extraordinary, secret powers of GCHQ and NSA are actually being used. Real oversight and hard limits must be put on the scope of how, why and when our intelligence agencies can spy. In response to the latest revelations, Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: Yet again we are faced with widespread surveillance that has nothing to do with national security, begging the question whether GCHQ has become a law unto itself. If European officials are fair game it of course begs the question if British people serving in international organisations have been targeted by GCHQ. President Obama recognised how serious these revelations are and commissioned a full and frank review of the NSA's operations. It is time for the British government to do the same with GCHQ. Contacted by The New York Times about being a surveillance target on at least two dates in 2008 and 2009, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, who is vice-president of the European commission with responsibility for competition policy, said he was \u201cstrongly upset\u201d (sic) about being spied on. He said he did not know what intelligence services might have been after, but checked his outlook diary to check where he was on the dates of the intercepts. On 3 November, 2008, the date of the first report and a Monday, he was in Brussels, attending a meeting of finance ministers from the euro area, where the financial crisis unfolding at the time was on the agenda. But he did not recall any details of the discussion. The same day he announced fresh economic forecasts at a press conference. He had been preparing them from home over the weekend leading up to the meeting, he said. He did not recall any sensitive mobile phone conversations from that weekend. On 22 January, 2009, he was in Copenhagen, testifying at a public parliamentary hearing alongside Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, about the euro. In the preceding two days he had been in Brussels. On 20 January, there was a meeting of EU finance ministers and on 21 January, he had a private lunch meeting with Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re, who at the time headed a commission for a report on how to reorganise banking supervision in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about \u2013 and any new areas you'd like to read more about. Here's a summary of the latest developments: \u2022 British and American intelligence agencies had a comprehensive list of surveillance targets that included the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, German government buildings in Berlin and overseas, and the heads of institutions that provide humanitarian and financial help to Africa. The disclosures which are based on leaks by the whistleblower Edward Snowden have been published in a joint investigation by the Guardian, the German news magazine Der Spiegel and the New York Times. \u2022 Aid agencies targeted including the United Nations development programme, the UN\u2019s children\u2019s charity Unicef and M\u00e9decins du Monde, a French organisation that provides doctors and medical volunteers to conflict zones. Leigh Daynes, an executive director of M\u00e9decins du Monde in the UK, said he was \u201cshocked and surprised by these appalling allegations of secret surveillance on our humanitarian operations\u201d. \u2022 One GCHQ document, drafted in January 2009, makes clear the agencies were targeting an email address listed as belonging to the \u201cIsraeli prime minister\u201d who was Ehud Olmert at the time. Three other Israeli targets appeared on the documents, including another email address understood to have been used to send messages between the then Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and his chief of staff, Yoni Koren. \u2022 Surveillance targets include Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, who is vice-president of the European commission with responsibility for competition policy. Almunia has been involved in a long-running investigation into Google over complaints about the company\u2019s alleged stranglehold on online advertising; he has also clashed with Google and Microsoft over privacy concerns, and was prominent in the EU\u2019s response to the global financial crisis. \u2022 The latest disclosures come after a White House review panel recommended that the NSA should be banned from attempting to undermine the security of the internet and stripped of its power to collect telephone records in bulk. \u2022 The White House review prompted several British MPs to call for tougher scrutiny of the Britain's security services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
