While society recognises that under-16s shouldn't be exposed to voting, sex and military service, it actively encourages stately homes to foist themselves on children. The tedium for a 10-year-old of an ancestral abode is hard to overstate: shuffling from room to room, legs leaden, to look at old, hand-crafted chairs - and not even allowed to sit on them. But once we had the family ticket, we were going to get value, like it or not. From 1 April English Heritage is abandoning its family membership. Good news? Not necessarily. Now any adult member can take any child in free of charge, you won't even be safe from your neighbours. English Heritage says it's 'a marvellous chance for youngsters to soak up history and become future champions of the historic environment'. As a former youngster, a bit of me wants to yell 'no chance'. And yet... While sitting on the platform at Manchester's Oxford Road station recently, my eyes were inexorably drawn to the rack of tourist leaflets. And when I saw that familiar, dreaded leafy NT logo, I suddenly found myself mulling over an outing to Bodnant Gardens or Chirk Castle. What could it mean? Does some genetic programming kick in to make you suddenly consider stately homes the definitive Great Day Out? I suspect something worse: that English Heritage's insidious plan may well work because, in all fields of travel, we are destined to repeat the mistakes of our forefathers. I could write off the weird National Trust longings as an aberration. But they came just months after I was contemplating revisiting other childhood traumas: camping - and worse, driving through France, recreating journeys that left my teenage incarnation somewhere between travelsick and shellshocked. Inherited patterns of holiday and leisure behaviour are difficult to break. Without a schooling in hotels with pools, I was astonished, aged 25, to find towels provided; without having flown before, I was amazed to find planes had flowery wallpapered interiors (I later found this was only on Biman Bangladesh). Yet I never questioned for a moment the act of wandering into an old foreign church and looking at its windows, just because it was there. So beware then, what you do on holiday with your kids, because you are laying down a pattern for generations. Already trapped, I may well be heading off to a restored mill some weekend soon. All I can do is promise my future offspring I won't buy a family membership - great value though I'm beginning to think they are. \u00b7 A year's family membership of the National Trust costs \u00a360 for two adults and their children or grandchildren. Annual adult membership of English Heritage costs \u00a334.
