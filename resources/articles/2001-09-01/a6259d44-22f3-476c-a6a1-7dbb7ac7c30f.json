At a private meeting in London last week experts on the Government's foot and mouth science committee concluded that the 'tail' of the outbreak could last into 2002. 'The consensus was for an end around the new year. In a worst case scenario it could go on longer,' said one senior source who was there. This forecast will further embarrass a government already facing severe criticism over its handling of the crisis and new calls for farm animals to be vaccinated. As soldiers yesterday moved in to help fight the latest outbreak in Northumberland, some farmers' leaders slammed the present policy of mass slaughter and 'biosecurity' - hygiene and restricted livestock movements. 'The Government is like a compulsive gambler,' said Roy Miller of the National Foot and Mouth Group of retired farmers and rural business people. 'They think they will win if they keep on betting the same way. But they should vaccinate, not procrastinate.' However, Ministers are unlikely to back down. Vaccination would threaten the export prospects of British meat - and culling 'is a policy that works,' said a spokesman for the Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra). After seven months and the slaughter of millions of animals have failed to eradicate the disease, many people disagree. 'It has been hopeless, completely hopeless,' said Dr Ruth Watkins, a con sultant clinical virologist and South Wales sheep farmer. Peter Midmore, professor of rural studies at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth, said the economic costs of the disease continuing far outweighed the potential - and temporary - loss of exports caused by vaccination. The longer the epidemic went on, the weaker the export argument became. 'It is looking pretty weak now,' he said. Scientists at the London meeting heard how the outbreak in Northumberland, which had been disease-free for almost three months, came within 'a whisker' of restarting the epidemic across the country. Of the 16 new cases there so far, none of the infected animals had been moved recently. Otherwise, the virus could easily have reinfected other areas or - in a 'nightmare scenario' - spread the disease nationwide to regions previously untouched. 'We were very lucky. People were shocked how close an escape we have had,' said the source. The committee now wants the Government to tighten severely the restrictions on livestock movements, eased only last week. An announcement is expected tomorrow. The Tory agriculture spokesman Tim Yeo accused Ministers of a U-turn: 'Yet again the Government has failed to learn the lessons of the 1967 outbreak, when they they started to ease restrictions before it was justified.' Moving animals is seen as the main reason behind the continued spread of the virus. The new restrictions will class counties as 'infected', 'at risk' or 'disease free'. No movements 'down the chain' from an area of higher risk to one of lower risk will be allowed, the source said. The issuing of movement licences for animals will also be tightened. In many areas of the country, issuing permits for livestock movement has become routine. The announcement will anger many farmers who have been pressing for even freer movements. They say that animals have been stranded in the same field for months amid growing areas of mud, restricting grazing and denying them shelter in cold weather. 'Farmers are suffering and the animals are suffering. We cannot go on like this in the face of government incompetence,' said Miller of the NMFG. Many farmers feel the Government has reacted too slowly to the crisis - and then unfairly blamed them for their own plight. 'Defra is a black propaganda machine,' Miller added. In Northumberland the Government's much-vaunted 'blue box' tactic of massive biosecurity measures failed last week to stop the epidemic spreading. One of the new cases reported last Friday was outside the 400-square mile restricted area around the Allendale Valley. This triggered an enlargement of the blue box and the Army was called in. The disease continued to spread too in neighbouring Cumbria. Two new cases - also on Friday - brought the national total to almost 2,000. New government efforts are already too late for Alwyn Tait and 15 fellow farmers whose herds and flocks were slaughtered in Allendale last week. After watching his 170 cows and 530 sheep shot, Tait said: 'It just makes me feel angry. The Government doesn't care at all about farmers. They think we haven't got a future on the land.' His family has farmed in Allendale for three generations, and it is the second outbreak on his farm this year. Now he fears the return of the devastating virus will mean the end for his farm. 'The valley has been wiped out. We are all going to end up being park-keepers. There won't be any animals left,' Tait said. But it is not just farmers who have been hit by the return of the disease. Throughout Northumberland a shaky recovery in the tourism industry has now been destroyed. Last week hoteliers and shop owners throughout the county reported a collapse in trade. The Northumberland Tourism Board had been poised to launch a massive series of advertising campaigns trying to lure visitors back. These have now been put on ice. Spokesman Richard Spencer said: 'It has knocked us back again. Defra just look at the facts and figures of the outbreak - but we are dealing with the people involved. We are being flooded with inquiries from our members desperate to know what is going on.'
