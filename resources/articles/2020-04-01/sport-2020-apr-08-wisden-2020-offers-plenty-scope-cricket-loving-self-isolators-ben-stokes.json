What better way to self-isolate than to escape into some of the 1,536 pages of this year\u2019s Wisden? The 157th edition has just been published, the only problem that remains is distributing the little yellow monster, which in every other year heralds the arrival of the season. The Wisden of 2020, like the Archers and Desert Island Discs, is unsullied by the coronavirus epidemic, which is likely to be a source of relief. In time this edition could well become a collector\u2019s item \u2013 like those of 1982 or 2006 \u2013 since it covers a summer of momentous cricket that includes a bizarre World Cup victory and that match at Headingley. The 2021 edition will be even more collectable \u2013 and maybe more challenging for the editor, Lawrence Booth, since it will be recording a year notable for the absence of much cricket. Unsurprisingly, Ben Stokes keeps popping up. He receives the award of leading cricketer in the world, the first Englishman to win it since Andrew Flintoff in 2006. Stokes made Booth\u2019s job more straightforward and there is a hint of gratitude in the editor\u2019s observation: \u201cWithout him this almanack might have been another English hard luck story. Instead it\u2019s a celebration.\u201d Oddly the five cricketers of the year section contains just one English player, Jofra Archer. Perhaps that is why Booth feels the need to give us an explanation of his choices, which I do not think has happened before. This is one of the few bits we do not need in the almanack. The editor does not have to justify his decisions; he just has to deliver them and then the rest of us can start arguing or speculating how he opted for his chosen five, a process which is always complicated by the fact that no one can win this award twice. As ever Booth\u2019s notes are elegant and forceful. Unsurprisingly he wants a bigger TV audience for the big events \u2013 like the World Cup \u2013 and a retention of five-day Test cricket. He conjures up the notion of \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s bat\u201d when contemplating the World Cup final result (maybe he could have explained that; and maybe that phrase will resurface in Private Eye). There are some lovely memories of Bob Willis from his great friend Paul Allott as well as a comprehensive account of his life in cricket in the obituary section, which, as ever, contains some wonderful vignettes. In proximity we find \u201cMugabe, Robert Gabriel\u201d and \u201cMoss, Alan Edward\u201d and it is reassuring that five times more space is devoted to Moss. Mugabe has some connection with cricket \u2013 he met Mark Nicholas on England A\u2019s 1990 tour of Zimbabwe; Moss, the son of a policeman from Tottenham, played 307 games for Middlesex and nine times for England as a wholehearted pace bowler. Here was a reminder of how times have changed a bit. Moss was a professional but he captained the county side quite often in 1962 and was a candidate to be given the job officially; instead they appointed the amateur and recent Oxford blue, CD Dryborough. The class divide remained strong. \u201cWe played at the Oval when JJ Warr [an amateur] was captain and I was in the pros\u2019 dressing room,\u201d Moss once recalled. \u201cI was the senior pro and JJ said to me: \u2018There\u2019s no room in there; come on in with us.\u2019 So I put my bags in there and put them down. Then Peter May [captain of Surrey] walked in, took him to one side and said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, JJ, Mossy can\u2019t stay in here.\u2019\u201d May was resistant to any change in the old order, it seems. He crops up in Colin Schindler\u2019s fine piece about the Stop the Tour campaign of 50 years ago. Emotions ran high over whether the South African tour to England in 1970 should take place. \u201cDavid Sheppard, Bishop of Woolwich and an advocate of cancellation, attempted to arrange a conciliatory meeting,\u201d writes Schindler. \u201cPeter May, his Cambridge friend and former colleague, replied bluntly there was nothing to talk about \u2026 His relationship with May never recovered.\u201d There are treasures galore to be discovered, all meticulously gathered and utterly trustworthy except on pages 1500-1508, which are devoted to the 2020 fixture list."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
