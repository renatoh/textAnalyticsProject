Simply put, it was one of pure contentment. A win over the Baggies is always a source of pleasure for the Blues and this time, in the context of the First Division play-off places, it was doubly so. Add this to the prospect of next Sunday's Worthington Cup final against Liverpool in Cardiff's Millennium stadium, and heaven's gates are open. Neither of these teams has played at the top level since the mid-80s, and the odds are that Fulham, Bolton and Blackburn may deny one or both again this season. Yet having disposed of three Premiership teams in the Worthington Cup - Tottenham, Newcastle and Ipswich - City fans are understandably inclined to believe next season's derby will be against Villa. Perhaps they are right. The play-offs are, after all, a mini-cup competition and Birmingham have proved themselves adept at the formula this season. Saturday's match was also reminiscent of a cup-tie, and again Birmingham gained the upper hand by applying concerted second-half pressure. West Bromwich, so near to relegation last season, have been transformed by Gary Megson, who has spent more than \u00a35m in the process. The team reflects the manager. There are few frills, but they play with conviction and re solve. For many seasons Albion have appeared virtually unmanageable. Megson, at last, has provided some cause for cautious optimism. Having rather weakly lost their previous match away to Sheffield United, Birmingham needed to rebuild confidence, and the manager Trevor Francis was clearly concerned the final against Liverpool was having an adverse effect. He shuffled his pack, and was rewarded with unconditional commitment, epitomised by his skipper Martin O'Connor, who scored the winning goal and drew rich praise from Megson: \"It's good to see players like Martin who have played in the lower divisions prove themselves, and get their chance to play in big matches. He was tremendous throughout and set a terrific example.\" Dele Adebola, who invariably scores against the Albion, put Birmingham ahead after Fernando Derveld, still acclimatising to English football, failed to realise the full danger of Curtis Woodhouse's cross, which Nicky Eadon headed on for Adebole. The celebrations had barely ceased before Al bion equalised, Tony Butler, with a rare goal, heading in Ruel Fox's free-kick. \"We conceded three goals from set pieces against Sheffield United, and this was poor defending again,\" said Francis. He had little else to complain about as City dominated the second half. Albion came to life only in the five minutes bafflingly added by the referee. Lee Hughes might have equalised as they threw in the kitchen sink. \" It was the only time in the second half I was really concerned,\" said Francis. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
