The argument whether England should field a specialist wicketkeeper or a wicketkeeper-batsman has its roots in a decision taken 40 years ago. The domination of the wicketkeeper-batsman now spreads throughout the cricketing world but for England its beginnings can be traced back to the 1959-60 tour of the West Indies and the days leading up to the final Test in Trinidad. Godfrey Evans had retired the previous autumn and uncertainty lay all around. With Roy Swetman unavailable at Port of Spain, England could have turned to his understudy, Northamptonshire's Keith Andrew, the most talented gloveman of his generation, but he was a lower-order batsman of little repute and he had caught pneumonia on the boat to the West Indies and had been ill for much of the tour. Instead, seeking to protect a 1-0 lead in the series, and with their batting hit by injury, they summoned \"young\" Jim Parks, who had been coaching in the Caribbean, an adventurous middle-order batsman who had kept wicket for Sussex for little more than a year and who was regarded, in the parlance of the day, as \"a stopper\". There was no ill feeling. Parks borrowed Andrew's bat, made an unbeaten century in the second innings and the series was England's. Parks went on to play 46 times for England, Andrew twice. Both are now well into their seventies, although \"young Jim\" proved to be just that, continuing to play for the Old England XI until he was 66. Both wicketkeepers have watched Jones' attempts to hold down an England Test place on TV and heard the loyal pronouncements of his coach Duncan Fletcher. The two men around whom the debate first flared might have different perspectives but on many aspects of the Jones v Read debate they are in agreement. Andrew, who took a record 810 dismissals for Northants until his retirement in 1966 and whose coaching skills were held in high regard as chief executive of the National Cricket Association, is the least forgiving. He scoffs when he learns that Jones, at Fletcher's behest, has been having tuition from an England goalkeeping coach. \"Why, is he an inside-forward?\" he asks. \"What nonsense. What does a goalkeeper know about wicketkeeping? Jones looks a nice lad, and he can bat a bit, but behind the stumps he does make you wonder.\" Fletcher has defended Jones by voicing the notion that you can turn a batsman into a wicketkeeper but you cannot turn a wicketkeeper into a batsman. Parks, who had played 10 years as a middle-order batsman before his captain, Robin Marlar, persuaded him to solve Sussex's wicketkeeping crisis, might be expected to agree but he has his reservations after Jones's dropped catches at Lord's. \"It was my batting that got me in the side but wicketkeeping is also a natural thing,\" Parks said. \"I used to field at cover and I had a safe pair of hands. I wasn't a stylist but I didn't drop much standing back. You can't afford to miss chances. Jones had a bad match at Lord's and that can happen. But, if he repeats it at Edgbaston, then his place must be in jeopardy. \"I've seen a lot more of Chris Read. He's a good keeper, no doubt about that. And then there is another boy at Sussex, Matt Prior, who can bat a bit and whose keeping has improved since he began to do the job full-time. I was a strokemaker and so is he.\" If Jones's keeping limitations are to be tolerated, then he must bat with the ability - if not necessarily in the position - of a top-six batsman. As Andrew remarked: \"Jones needs more runs. Jim Parks was just a slip catcher with gloves on - but he was a highly skilled batsman.\" Comparisons suggest that Jones may yet meet the requirements. His Test batting average of nearly 31 equals that of Parks and is only one lower than the incomparable Alan Knott, not only a fine keeper but a man whose superior batting kept out Bob Taylor in the 1970s. But, crucially, Jones plays in an era where batsmen hold sway. A more pertinent statistical comparison is that of Alec Stewart, whose keeping became so invaluable to England's attempts to balance the side over the last decade and who still retired with an average approaching 40. For Jones to match that against Australia, and to hold his catches, would be quite a retort. But those who fancy that the bookmakers are right in naming Jones as 6-4 favourite to be the first England player to lose his place should consider Andrew's warning. He believes that the twin \"evils\" of covered pitches and a lack of spin bowlers has hastened the extinction of the specialist keeper. \"You don't really need a wicketkeeper now,\" he said. \"With all this fast bowling on covered pitches, you can just ask a top-six batsman to put the gloves on. Alec Stewart did that very well. But I'll tell you this: England will never develop a spin bowler of Shane Warne's calibre unless they also have a wicketkeeper of quality.\" How today's wicketkeeper batsmen compare Australia: Adam Gilchrist Age 33 Tests 69 Highest score 204 Batting average 54.73 Catches 263 Stumpings 27 Gilchrist insists he is a wicketkeeper first and a batsman second. Seriously. His ratio of dismissals-per-innings is best among the world's top keepers. South Africa: Mark Boucher Age 28 Tests 84 Highest score 125 Batting average 30.68 Catches 309 Stumpings 14 South Africa tried to phase him out last winter but a keeper who has proved his fighting qualities over 75 consecutive Tests was not about to let go easily. West Indies: Ridley Jacobs Age 37 Tests 65. Highest score 118 Batting average 28.32 Catches 207 Stumpings 12 Jacobs has recently retired but he is the nearest the modern West Indies side have had to a successful batsman-wicketkeeper. New Zealand: Brendon McCullum Age 23 Tests 15 Highest score 143 Batting average 32.96 Catches 36 Stumpings 2 Bats up the order in one-dayers and has proved a solid contributor in New Zealand's Test middle-order. Still early in his career. India: Dinesh Kartik Age 20 Tests 8 Highest score 93 Batting average 22.09 Catches 23 Stumpings 4 At 20 Kartik is still learning his trade, having taken over from Parthiv Patel. Seems destined to be India's long-term Test wicketkeeper. Handy batsman. Pakistan: Kamran Akmal Age 23 Tests 15 Highest score 109 Batting average 19.62 Catches 50 Stumpings 12 An attacking batsman who demolished West Indies in a recent one-day game in Brisbane. Rated a solid gloveman by the Australian legend Ian Healy. Sri Lanka: Kumar Sangakkara Age 27 Tests 48 Highest score 270 Batting average 48.84 Catches 111 Stumpings 15 Second only to Gilchrist among Test wicketkeepers. A top-order batsman and would be captaincy material if he did not already carry such a heavy burden. England: Geraint Jones Age 29 Tests 16 Highest score 100 Batting average 30.50 Catches 60 Stumpings 2 Jones's promising start with the bat has not appeased those who yearn for the silkier skills of Chris Read. But, if Jones can move his average towards the mid-30s and hold the catches that matter, he can still silence the debate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
