Police said Dr Azahari, a Malaysian explosives expert nicknamed the Demolition Man and accused of coordinating attacks on Bali that have killed more than 200 people, is believed to have deliberately blown himself up rather than be arrested after a 10-day stake-out at a villa in Batu, in eastern Java. Indonesia's national police chief, General Sutanto, told reporters that officers and snipers had surrounded the hideout of Azahari, who studied for his doctorate at Reading University in the 1980s. Suspected militants fired on police outside the house and set off at least 11 explosions. \"The last one, the big one, was a suicide blast. That is the one that killed them,\" he said, adding that police were afraid the house had been booby-trapped. The authorities would seek to confirm tomorrow that Azahari was dead, he said. Two other suspected militants had also died in the blast, police said. If Azahari's death is confirmed, it will be a significant blow to Jemaah Islamiyah, a terror network with links to al-Qaida. Officials say Azahari, aged about 48, was Jemaah Islamiyah's bomb-making expert. He has eluded police for years by moving from one rented home to another in densely populated areas. Together with a fellow Malaysian, Noordin Mohamed Top, Azahari is accused of direct involvement in at least four terrorist attacks, including the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, as well as last month's suicide attacks on the same island, which claimed 20 lives. The authorities had no immediate information about whether Noordin was among those involved in Wednesday's operation. Officials have said the two men usually travelled apart. Hundreds of onlookers crowded behind yellow police tape for a glimpse of the bombed-out villa. White smoke was pouring from the roof, which collapsed in the final blast, and gunfire injured a policeman, officials said. Azahari is said to have joined Jemaah Islamiyah in the late 1990s and been sent for training in an al-Qaida camp in Kandahar, in Afghanistan. The group seeks to establish an Islamic state spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern Philippines. Azahari studied in Australia for four years in the 1970s and 10 years later studied for his doctorate at Reading University's department of land management. His transformation into an Islamist militant came several years later when he fell under the influence of founders of Jemaah Islamiyah including its spiritual leader, Abu Bakar Ba'asyir. He has narrowly evaded capture several times across Java and Sumatra in the past few years, most notably when he was not recognised by a traffic police officer who stopped the person with whom he was travelling for a minor violation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
