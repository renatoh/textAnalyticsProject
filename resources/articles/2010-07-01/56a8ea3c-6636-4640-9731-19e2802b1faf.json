That is not a question the supermarket has been prepared to answer, however differently Digger has phrased it over the past week of making inquiries. Southend have something Sainsbury's wants: the Roots Hall stadium. It intends to plonk one of the UK's biggest superstores on the site, while building another ground at a location across town. All well and good, except that its tactics for procuring the site have involved propping up a football club that HM Revenue &amp; Customs has told the high court is \"incontrovertibly insolvent on both a cashflow and balance-sheet basis\". There have been wage arrears, loan arrears and tax arrears and Southend have been unable to meet obligations on their own. Back in July 2008, Sainsbury's paid a \u00a31m deposit on the ground to Roots Hall Ltd and have apparently been handing over hundreds of thousands at a time ever since. The latest tranche seems to be \u00a3238,000, claimed by HMRC \u2013 which has led to the taxman applying for a court administration order. As Southend's finance director, Nigel Brunning, told the high court: \"We have been supported by Sainsbury's supermarket over the last year.\" But does that help? Well it does if you are Ron Martin, Southend's owner, but not quite if you are a Southend fan. Presumably Sainsbury's support does not come for free and is arranged on commercial terms, meaning the long-term value of the club's assets is being hocked to cover short-term obligations it cannot afford. FA ready to Yahoo! The Football Association is unlikely to have a title sponsor in place for England's 11 August friendly against Hungary following Nationwide's announcement yesterday that it will not extend its decade-long relationship. That might pose difficulties for the FA and its consultant, IMG, since most major brands' sponsorship budgets are already settled for the next 12 months. But there are industry rumours that the next sponsor could be Yahoo!, the $21bn (\u00a313.8bn) technology giant for whom the \u00a35m a season for the England contract would be small beer. It has already made a splash in football with its tie-up with England's David Beckham. And in terms of brand exposure, Yahoo! could do a lot worse than the 7m guaranteed pairs of eyeballs that tune in to England matches, however badly the team are performing. Grass is greener this side What a pity that England could be playing to a half-empty house at Wembley when they take on Hungary, since those who do turn up could at least be treated to a playable pitch. Fabio Capello is expected to stick with the pampered, preening pack of players that did England so proud in South Africa \u2013 enough to put anyone off \u2013 but there are at least signs they will have decent grass to play on. That is because, after the three years of Passchendaele surfaces served up by the Sports Turf Research Institute, the Desso synthetic-fibre-and-grass mix installed following STRI's resignation from its Wembley contract last month appears to have worked. For the first time, grass has been sown en place and there are high hopes among insiders that this time it will prove to be playable. Rio Tweets a fine line Rio Ferdinand appears to have been collared by Manchester United's Twitter police, at a time when the Old Trafford club might be just a little sensitive over its transfer-market inactivity. Yesterday at about 1pm the England defender tweeted: \"I wonder What would you do in our position,Would u refrain from making acquisitions,try 2 make a profit or just try 2 make a difference...?\" And then, about 1.02pm, came the hasty addendum: \"And that wasn't referring to my club!\" Naturally, given the reference to \"in our position\", one of his followers asked what it did refer to. \"Life in general,\" came the reply. Right-o Rio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
