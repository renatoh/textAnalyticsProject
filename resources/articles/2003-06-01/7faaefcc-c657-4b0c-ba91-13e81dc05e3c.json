With the intrigue over and the marketing strategies crafted, it will soon be time for David Beckham the midfielder to re-emerge, without a PR campaign or a retinue to protect him. Having chosen to join Real Madrid, he will be a 28-year-old ripped from the challenging yet profoundly reassuring environment in which he has existed for half his life. \"All of a sudden he's away from the lads he grew up with at Manchester United and, although the Nevilles might still be on the other end of the phone, it won't be the same,\" said the former Old Trafford manager Ron Atkinson. \"I have no qualms about the football side of the transfer. The only problem will be if he has some reluctance about it. He's got to see it as a great adventure in an already glittering career. Beckham has to apply himself just as he has in the past.\" The tale of the British player abroad has often been absurd or embarrassing and John Collins, who settled so well at Monaco that he became the club captain, is a rare exception. He stresses the effort required, recalling how he would while away journeys on the team bus by playing language tapes or listening to the conversations around him and picking out words he could look up in a dictionary later. \"There will be times when Beckham is still in temporary accommodation and feeling lonely,\" said Collins. \"He'll be thinking about how easy everything was in Manchester, and he has to get over that. You must make a concerted effort to learn the language. That gets you the instant respect of your team-mates, the club officials and the fans. If you don't speak the language everyone will jump on your back when things go wrong.\" If Beckham can, initially, master a few Spanish phrases they will serve as passwords to gain entry into the hearts of supporters who yearn to think well of a \u00a325m signing. Atkinson knows, too, that the England captain must be conversant with the culture of the Bernabeu dressing room. \"Unless you can communicate you miss out on the fun that goes on and you're not really part of the team,\" he said. Beckham's head will throb with the new vocabulary and he will not be able to drop into a comfortable old routine on the pitch either. It is presumed that Real will grant him the role that Sir Alex Ferguson denied him, but now he has to prove that he is cut out for it. \"I think he will be in the central position that he's never really been allowed to hold for Manchester United or England,\" Atkinson said. \"He'll be in beside Claude Makelele so that he can control the game and he'll be able to break wide from there at the right time. \"There is no danger Beckham will end up playing too deep in that side. Makelele is meant to be the anchor man but you're just as likely to see him up with the attack because Real spend so much time in the other team's half. If Beckham gets settled then we might find Sven-Goran Eriksson giving him the same job in the middle of the England team.\" Once he holds his preferred role we shall also have the chance to see just how highly the latest addition to the Real squad should be rated. \"I don't believe that Beckham would rank himself with the very best in the world,\" said Collins. \"He'd probably be the first to tell you that he's not in the same class as Zinedine Zidane. \"That's no disgrace at all. In fact you have to admire him for making the most of himself. If anything he's had to overachieve to get where he is today because he's not the quickest, he's not a dribbler and he's not really a tackler. \"What he does have is a great range of passing and crossing.\" Atkinson, however, believes that the switch may guide Beckham to a new level of performance. \"This move is his opportunity to make himself one of the all-time greats in European football,\" he said. \"He could put himself up there with Zidane. He could take his own place in Real's folklore.\" Zidane's reputation in club football has been transformed by his transfer to the Bernabeu, and Beckham, for the same reason, might look more impressive in that setting. \"An awful lot of problems can be overcome when there are great players all around you,\" Collins said, knowing that it is supreme talents who can do most to put Beckham at ease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
