Each year, he packs out concert halls across the UK with repertoire ranging from Bach to John Rutter, Handel's Messiah, carolling choirs like King's College, Cambridge and a sprinkling of pop. Yet what all of the promoter's sounds have in common is that we've heard them all before, because to expect anything new is against the Christmas spirit. Throughout this week, Gubbay is based at London's Royal Albert Hall to oversee its 13-day festive concert series. \"We try to keep the programmes up to date and cutting edge where we can,\" he says. It's his busiest time of year: of the 600 or so classical concerts and events he puts on each year, nearly a third take place during the Christmas period; in financial terms, 40% of his estimated \u00a315m to \u00a318m annual turnover is generated in just three and a half weeks. \"We want nostalgia,\" he says. \"People like to be able to break away from everyday life and get back into a world that perhaps never existed in a way that they would like it to have done \u2013 one where they can evoke these kinds of feelings.\" Our longing for Christmas nostalgia is centuries old. Handel's Messiah is a case in point. It was actually written for Lent, premiering at three performances in Dublin in April and June of 1742. Its libretto tells not just of the nativity, but the story of Christ from birth, through crucifixion and resurrection to Judgment Day, yet its close association with giving \u2013 in particular, its benefit performance for the Foundling hospital in 1754 \u2013 have catapulted it into our season of goodwill. Of course, you'll often find the Passion mentioned in the same musical breath as the nativity (in The Holly and the Ivy, for example), and you'll also find secular music masquerading as sacred. Bach's Christmas Oratorio, for example, was not specifically composed for Christmas, but assembled from his earlier secular scores. Without the time to create a new composition, Bach pieced the Christmas Oratorio together from three cantatas (BWV 213-5) written for the elector of Saxony. This technique, known as parody, allowed him to adapt several pieces for the six church services of Christmas (1734\u20115), styling only chorales and a Pastoral Symphony for the occasion. The truth is, there isn't really such a thing as Christmas music \u2013 not a style of music that belongs only to Christmas, anyway. Listen to the hymns that are assigned to the Christmas season and you'll find no particular contours to their melodies or rhythms that distinguish them from the music written for any other time. And even in the realm of carols \u2013 an aural tradition whose complex origins, explored by Esther Addley in last week's Guardian (7 December), lie beyond the nativity, with the round dance and pagan celebrations of the winter solstice \u2013 you'll find the recycling of pre-existening melodies. Among Gubbay's favourites is Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, a carol whose melody is taken from Mendelssohn's rousing Festgesang (1840), originally written not to glorify the \"newborn king\", but to celebrate the 400th-anniversary of printing with movable type. In a letter to his London publishers, Mendelssohn discounted the religious use of his melody, asserting \"it will never do to sacred words\". John Wesley's were later added, nonetheless, and the Mendelssohn melody we know today was adapted by WH Cummings, the organist of Waltham Abbey, Essex. Nevertheless, there are those who use Christmas as an opportunity to look forward and create anew. One is the King's College, Cambridge choirmaster, Stephen Cleobury, who makes a point of commissioning one new piece for his Festival of Nine Carols every year. Broadcast to millions around the world on Christmas Eve, the pure and timeless sound of a solo treble voice singing Once in Royal David's City signals to many that Christmas has begun. Cleobury explains: \"It's essential to introduce new works into this repertoire, because the church and church choirs do well to embrace as broad a spectrum of music as they can.\" But there's also a sense of public ownership over the King's celebration, he says. \"People have strong opinions about what they think is Christmas, and the sort of music I ought to be choosing, so I feel I'm treading a fine line between introducing new music on the one hand and presenting traditional fare on the other.\" The problem that King's faces \u2013 like many other programmers of popular services and Christmas concerts \u2013 is venturing into new territory without offending our festive hunger for familiarity. Nobody wants jalape\u00f1o stuffing with their turkey, however good it tastes. Alongside the \"traditional fare\" at King's this year is Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara's specially commissioned anthem called Christmas Carol \u2013 an austere work in four-part harmony that takes the wise men as its subject. The service will also include composer Judith Weir's Illuminare, Jerusalem, its first reappearance in the King's Christmas service since it was premiered there 25 years ago. Of course new motets and carols will be performed this Christmas, but it could be years before they're performed again. Composer John Rutter's popular What Sweeter Music premiered at the King's service in 1987. \"An awful lot gets written [for Christmas],\" he explains, \"but only a small amount filters down into the general repertoire and not at a rapid rate. You've only got one annual shot at it: however lovely a new piece is, it only gets aired in December.\" Yet it's between cold stone walls and around the flicker of festive flames that music has so often found its purest voice. Think of the childlike simplicity of Benjamin Britten's Ceremony of Carols, which nostalgically revisits the innocence of childhood; or Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on Christmas Carols and the carol settings of Holst, whose use of folksong, too, grew out of an idealisation of England's vanishing pastoral age. Their music is characteristically born out of a yearning for, to revisit Gubbay's words, \"a world that perhaps never existed\". Christmas is not just a time of nostalgia, then, but a time when the sentiments of our choral tradition and our winter festival \u2013 both secular and sacred \u2013 go happily hand in hand. No wonder Gubbay is celebrating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
