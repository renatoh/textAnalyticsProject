But had it not been for CIFAS, the UK's fraud prevention service which most people have never heard of, my experience could have been so much worse. It started when online retailer Very.co.uk wrote to ask me if I would phone them about my Very account. Given that I do not have a Very account, have never yet shopped at Very, and its letter was addressed to \"Mr\" J Papworth, I nearly threw it in the bin thinking it was some marketing exercise. But because it was sent out by its investigations department, I decided to contact them to ask what it was all about. A brief chat with the helpful woman who answered my call made things clear. Someone, though obviously not me, had filled in an online credit request to buy a laptop using my correct name, address, date of birth and home phone number. But a couple of factors had prompted Very to check it was genuine. The first thing that had alerted it to potential identity fraud was that the laptop ordered is at the top of Very's chart for items ordered fraudulently. But, more importantly, I was told that when the company did a standard credit check, a CIFAS warning was flagged up on my credit history file indicating that I had been the victim of another identity theft. CIFAS, a not-for-profit membership association, represents over 250 UK organisations across various business sectors including financial services, retail and telecommunications, who all agree to share details of fraudulent applications for products and services in an effort to prevent further cases. Where a CIFAS member finds clear evidence that, for example, a credit application has been made fraudulently using the details of an innocent individual, they put a warning on the CIFAS national fraud database. This is flagged up on the three main credit reference agencies Experian.co.uk, Equifax.co.uk and Callcredit.co.uk. When an application is made for credit under your name, the retailer will receive a warning saying: \"CIFAS \u2013 Do Not Reject \u2013 Validation Required\", prompting them to make further checks. This is exactly what had happened when CIFAS member Very.co.uk requested a credit check. Another member had placed a warning against my name. I then remembered an incident last year when a letter from a mobile phone company asked a \"Mr\" Papworth for payment on a newly-opened account. I told the company there was no \"Mr\" Papworth and that I hadn't opened an account. I was told not to worry, that they would cancel the account and take action to make sure the same \"mistake\" did not happen again. I thought little more about it. Now Very is going to strengthen the alert by putting a second \"Victim of impersonation\" warning against my name. I am grateful that the system is in place. Were it not, I could have received a laptop I had not ordered and be faced with the time-consuming and stressful task of proving that I was not liable for the cost. But I was left with questions. Having discovered that someone out there has stolen my personal details, is there anything further I should do to prevent falling victim to any future attempts to use my identity fraudulently? And what if I genuinely want to apply for credit in the future, be it a mortgage, credit card or mobile contract \u2013 will the extra verification checks CIFAS members need to make, be onerous? Richard Hurley, its communications manager, says that once you know you have been a victim of identity theft, you should alert any financial organisations with whom you have regular online contact. \"Because you are not sure how the fraudster got your details in the first place, you can't be sure what other details they may have,\" Hurley says. \"So, if you have financial accounts that you regularly use online with banks, credit card companies, PayPal and so on, it is sensible to tell them that you have been a victim of identity theft so that they can put any necessary further security measures in place to protect your account details. \"You should also change all your passwords if you have any concern that someone may know them.\" Victims can get further help by contacting any one of the three credit reference agencies (see above) and asking them to initiate their Victims of Fraud service. This provides advice about the relevant steps you can take to protect yourself. For example, adding a password to credit information that may be requested in the future by lenders. The service will also contact lenders on your behalf and help sort out any problems associated with fraudulent applications, and the credit reference agencies will keep an eye on your file and update you on any future applications in your name. My fear that the CIFAS warning on my file could make things tricky if I apply for credit in the future is valid, agrees Hurley. Lenders will take extra steps to verify my identity when I apply for credit and these will vary from organisation to organisation. If I apply to my bank for a credit card, for example, typical identity checks might include asking for details about my bank account that only I could know, such as what direct debits I have, the date and amount of my last cash withdrawal and so on. \"But they should not be too onerous,\" he says. \"Each organisation knows they need to balance the verification checks with good customer service.\" Now I understand why, when several months ago I set up a new mobile phone contract for my son at my local Tesco, the sales assistant told me apologetically that a problem had been flagged up on its system. I was asked to bring my passport or driving licence in to the store to prove my identity. At the time, believing that I had a pretty spotless credit history, I felt humiliated and cross about having to trek home and back again. But now I'm grateful that Tesco, obviously alerted by the original CIFAS warning already on my file, was ultimately protecting me by making sure I was who I said I was. Hurley says any worries I have that lenders will take the easy option and simply turn down any future credit applications because of the CIFAS warning, are unfounded. \"It's a condition of membership that members don't do that \u2013 a CIFAS flag is not a valid reason for turning down an application,\" he says. \"And where, on the odd occasion, we have discovered this to be the case, we have read the offending member the riot act. \"CIFAS can take sanctions against members who do this, and ultimately suspend them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
