In a year that has seen a rise in anti-immigration rhetoric from the right of his own Liberal party and the resurgence of Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party, the prime minister made a pointed reference to Australia\u2019s multicultural population. \u201cIn Australia we have much for which to be grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cNot least that so many different people of so many different backgrounds, races and religions live together here in a harmony founded on mutual respect. \u201cWe also remember those who find Christmas difficult \u2013 the lonely, the poor, the sick and those who are away from their families. Reach out to them if you can.\u201d In an earlier radio interview, Turnbull said Christmas was a season of love and that people should find time for others. \u201cIt\u2019s also a very important time to reach out and give a hug to those who aren\u2019t having as happy a Christmas as you might be,\u201d he told 2GB radio on Saturday. \u201cYou know for whatever reason \u2013 they\u2019re lonely, sick, estranged from their families. This is a season of love, and you should share it.\u201d Turnbull said he would be spending Sunday with his family, including his three grandchildren, and continuing his annual Christmas tradition of visiting Sydney\u2019s Wayside Chapel. But he said his family was shunning the traditional Christmas Day roast lunch in favour of cold dishes, and fish and ham. He downplayed his cooking abilities, describing himself as an \u201centhusiastic amateur\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, the rest of my family are much more talented at cooking than me,\u201d he admitted. Turnbull also paid tribute to his grandchildren \u2013 aged three, 18 months and six months \u2013 saying they made him feel like a young man again. \u201cEvery time I am with our grandchildren, it makes me feel as though I am back in my late 20s, early 30s, and I know [my wife] Lucy feels the same,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
