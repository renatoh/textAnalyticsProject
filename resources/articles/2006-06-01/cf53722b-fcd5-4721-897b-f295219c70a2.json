Today, still only a youthful 36, he's looking after a fund that has soared in value to \u00a3780m. It's quite a challenge for any manager to successfully handle such an influx of cash, and for the most part, Stick has done a good job. Despite recent stock market falls, Rathbone Income is up 24% over the last year, compared with the sector average of 18%. Over three years it is ahead 69% compared with the sector average of 59%. He says he hasn't changed his approach to running money, despite the increase in the fund's size. \"I cut my teeth looking for UK shares offering a real and sustainable increase in dividends. At the time I was buying Lloyds, Bass, Scottish Power and so on. I still think of this fund as something for private clients, targeted at individuals rather than institutions. You can get too removed from the underlying client when you work for a big company.\" A superficial glance at the top four holdings in the fund (BP, HSBC, RBS and Barclays) might suggest he's taking a more safety-first approach than before. But in truth, the portfolio is highly varied. There is a 4% limit on any individual stock, and Stick rarely reaches that level. It means, for example, that right now he's underweight in oils; 3.4% in BP when it makes up 8% of the FTSE100. His approach to pharmaceuticals reveals how he has stuck to his basic principles. Most other managers ponder over whether to underweight or overweight Glaxo or AstraZeneca. Stick doesn't hold either, and never has. \"If I put 3% of the fund into it, no one would bat an eyelid. But I've been concerned for a long time about the drugs pipeline and patent expiry.\" His favourite stocks are an eclectic bunch. He finds Drax very interesting. \"It has become much more viable to use coal-fired stations again. The coal price is up, but not anything like the oil price.\" On the smaller side, he likes Titan Europe, an engineering group that makes axles for giant Caterpillar mining and construction equipment. He also likes Foseco, another UK engineering success story. It makes ceramic filters and is doing rather well on the back of Chinese exports. Now Stick is launching a High Income fund, and thinks recent market falls offer one of the best buying opportunities in recent times. p.collinson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
