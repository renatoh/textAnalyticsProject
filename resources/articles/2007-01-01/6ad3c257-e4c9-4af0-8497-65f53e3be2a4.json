The things that catch their eye on a tour of Gordon Brown's official residence are those you don't expect to see in the seat of power: the zebra-print child's car seat tucked in the corner of his office, the paddling pool in the garden. What they want to hear during their visit to Downing Street, late last Friday afternoon, is a guarantee from the chancellor that he will pull his weight and persuade other developed countries to commit to getting every child in the world into primary school. Brown enters and a hush descends. He makes small talk with the pupils, all aged 13 or 14, asking them what their favourite subject is, what they want to do when they grow up; nothing original, but he's easy in his manner. The four are business-like, partly through nerves, but also because they want to make the most of their time with the chancellor. The secondary school pupils, from Langdon school, in east London, and Sir John Lawes, in Harpenden, are there on behalf of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), an international coalition of NGOs, charities and teacher unions, which is championing the millennium development goal, set by the United Nations, of getting every child into primary school by 2015. It's a matter close to the heart of the man many expect to be prime minister by the end of the year, and he intends to make the issue a centrepiece of his premiership. Brown has put Britain at the forefront of international efforts to make universal education a reality, promising \u00a38.5bn over the next 10 years to the cause - enough to get 15 million children currently not in school into a classroom. Earlier this month, writing in the Guardian, he announced his plan to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade with renewed efforts to \"abolish ignorance\". And tomorrow, on an official visit to India, he will announce the government's next big expansion in its funding of international education, with a programme to get every primary-aged child in India into school. Target drifts But, even with the boost from Britain, many question whether the goal is much more than a dream. Halfway to the 2015 deadline, the target of universal education drifts further away as the global school-age population expands. Forty million pupils have found a place at primary school. Yet there are still 80 million pupils of primary age who don't go to school - only 20 million fewer than when the millennium development goals were set in 2000. With all this firmly in mind, the pupils fire their questions at the second most powerful man in the country. Brown talks about schools he has seen in Africa that work in shifts, with some pupils doing a 6am to 9am school day, others learning from 9am to noon, and so on. He tells them about schools with 150 pupils to a classroom; and children who can't go to school because they don't have an exercise book. He discusses the desperate problem of educating children who are living in war zones, and those who are orphaned by Aids or diagnosed with the disease themselves. Barney Walker, a year 9 pupil from Sir John Lawes, asks the chancellor to name the G8 countries that aren't pulling their weight, and say what he is doing about it. \"I would cause great controversy if I named and shamed them,\" Brown says. \"Bob Geldof was once asked who's to blame, and he said we're all to blame. If we haven't solved this problem soon, we're going to all have to take responsibility. I don't want to single out any country; we want to help to bring all countries together.\" Barney doesn't give up. He repeats his question. \"I'll take you with me,\" the chancellor jokes, referring to a later meeting with other finance ministers. Then he adds: \"It's not just what a finance minister does, or what a politician does, it's what a community does. Remember the Make Poverty History campaign? Remember all the protests and demonstrations and the petitions and letters and television programmes? I think it would be great if we could have the same mobilisation of the public, the same grassroots involvement, the same numbers of people involved, saying it's time every child had a chance of getting an education. \"If we could do that, the campaign would move on in Britain, and [if] the same campaigns were in Germany and France and America and it all built up ...then I think people would come to realise that this is a very sensible commitment to make and that they should do it. School involvement \"One of the key things is schools themselves getting interested and saying: 'You're the government and you're the governments of the world - why don't you do more to try and solve the problem?'\" After questions from the pupils, Brown talks exclusively to Education Guardian about how he intends to ensure the other G8 countries follow the UK's lead. There is, in fact, a plan to name and shame the countries that are not doing their bit. \"We have a report in the next year that will be chaired by Kofi Annan to look at the progress that has been made [in aid for education], and it will all become clear to people who has done what and how much and so on,\" Brown says. \"We will continue to press for people to meet their commitment for education to Africa and development aid generally.\" He lists the meetings where he will lobby on the issue: the international finance meetings, the G8 and the next IMF/World Bank session. \"We will not lose sight of the fact that commitments have been made. We'll be pushing it.\" Is he going to challenge the World Bank and IMF on some of their more controversial policies? \"That's one of the biggest challenges of the future. We ought to be better at getting educational help there. We ought to be better on the environment and climate change, too ... The World Bank is going to have to have a role in that. These are things that the World Bank and IMF have got to be modernising for,\" he says. According to campaigners, Brown's backing for the cause can't go far enough. Owain James, world coordinator for the Global Campaign for Education, says the problem is essentially political. \"We know what the solutions are,\" he says. \"They are achievable. We need \u00a312bn to \u00a315bn a year to achieve it.\" He cites Kenya, where the fee-paying education system was nationalised and millions of children got a school place overnight. An estimated 7m primary school places have been created around the world in this way since 2000. \"It is simple and it can be done. It really is a question of political will. It requires money and power,\" says James. The trail from the international donor's promise, to the point where an extra child learns to read and write, is full of obstacles. There is not enough money, because there is not enough political will on the part of donors. There is not always enough political will in recipient countries, which often have their hands tied by other donor deals, particularly with the international financial institutions. Even with the money in place, there remains a teacher recruitment crisis. After that, comes a lack of buildings and equipment, and finally a lack of pupils, because so many work, care for relatives, or are ill or disabled (a third of those out of school are disabled, according to the charity Sightsavers International). Lucia Fry, head of policy at GCE, says: \"It's undeniable that the UK is taking the lead out of the G8 countries in terms of donations. But it doesn't compare well with the Nordic countries. Germany and Italy have a long way to go on this; the US as well. They have given large amounts of money, but it represents a small proportion of their national income. They seem to be allergic to multilateral funding as well. So Bush will fund a particular programme, but it's tinkering at the edges.\" Donor darlings Some recipient countries are still not prioritising education, or are doing so only for boys, or at a tertiary level rather than for basic reading and writing. The problem this can create in international aid is the phenomenon of \"donor darlings\", countries that are deemed easy to work with, says Fry. \"Education can be very much about Africa, but India is a problem, all over Asia, and even some parts of Europe.\" Brown points to the 22 African countries that are to receive funds from Britain, all of which have signed agreements with the UK and produced plans describing how they will spend the money. He insists there needs to be an \"open book\" about spending to ensure it does not end up in the pockets of corrupt leaders. The problem of teacher recruitment is equally complex, particularly in countries where HIV/Aids is attacking the adult population. David Archer, head of education at Action Aid, says 18 million teachers are needed to reach the millennium goal. \"The UK's aid will help do that. But - this is the big, big catch - the policies of the International Monetary Fund impose a cap on the public sector wage bill. On the one hand, Brown is making big pledges; on the other hand, they can't spend that aid on more teachers.\" In 2004, 11,000 teachers in Zambia were forced out of jobs because of this, he says. He adds: \"The World Bank has been supporting a policy of 'para-professional' teachers in Africa and Asia - people who are trained for a few weeks, put into schools, and paid a third of a teacher's salary. The Indian government now no longer trains or employs new teachers.\" There is also the question of what primary schooling should consist of. Will donor countries accept the community education that has traditionally existed, or will they want to standardise it? Fry says: \"Part of the problem is how to measure how many pupils go to school. Unesco use official enrolments, which don't account for drop-outs or remote community schools. Household surveys show different stories, but are patchy.\" There are signs that things are changing. GCE is backing the fast track initiative (FTI) within the World Bank, which directs aid for education to where it is most needed and monitors the results. It will ensure countries spend on primary education before they do so on universities, and that they make provision equally for boys and girls. If, under the scheme, five countries are donating to Tanzania, for example, Tanzania reports back to the FTI rather than to individual donors. Brown backs the initiative, and says it will be discussed at a forthcoming conference of donors in Brussels, a meeting on which he places a lot of importance in terms of pushing other countries to cough up. Resurgence of will \"I think there's a resurgence in the will for investment in Africa that you saw initially in the post-independent era,\" says Archer. \"After colonial rule, most governments invested significantly. Then came the petrol crises in the mid-70s, and the debt crises, and countries were compelled to freeze or hold back spending on education. That could be about to change.\" There are still vast swaths of the world where progress is slow. Tomorrow, on his visit to India, the chancellor will announce a major investment to help the country achieve universal primary education. But the irony is that, at the same time, the UK is worried about the intense competition that world-class universities in India now pose to its own ability to attract international students. The message Brown repeats over and over is that there needs to be popular support. But for all his talk of grassroots action, is it not his job to use his political might? Brown says: \"We've taken the lead in education. We made a 10-year commitment, which we've never done before. We have taken the lead unilaterally. The next stage is to get other countries to do this ... Having made the first step ourselves, I'm confident other countries will. \u00b7 Today the Global Campaign for Education launches its Join Up!
