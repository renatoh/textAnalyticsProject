Three matches away from winning Wimbledon is no time to be swept away by national sentiment in a game as unforgiving as tennis. The Scot who is England's darling in the wake of the football team's spirit-sapping exit from the World Cup looked superb again in winning his fourth match of the tournament, a fairly trouble-free dismissal of the American Sam Querrey in two hours and six minutes on Centre Court today. He won in straight sets yet again \u2013 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 \u2013 and, with fewer minutes and sets on the clock than any of the remaining high seeds, is well placed to reach the semi-finals. \"I went through a bad patch at the end of the first set,\" Murray said of a performance beset by a minimum of glitches, \"where I lost my focus a little bit. I did really well to win the set in the end because he had some chances.\" That he did. But, because of the excellence of Murray's returns and the sophistication of his attack, from the baseline and, encouragingly, at the net, there was little Querrey could do to stop the rot. He broke Murray in the first set but could not press the advantage. Murray, in contrast, has reached a stage of his career, much of it at the highest level, where minor setbacks do not unduly trouble him. \"I'm not going to play my best every minute of the tournament. And I'm not going to serve my best in every match,\" he said. \"Some matches I'm not going to hit my ground strokes as well. You have to deal with the situations when they arise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
