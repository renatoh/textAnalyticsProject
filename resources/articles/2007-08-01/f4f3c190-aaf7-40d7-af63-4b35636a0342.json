According to the elections watchdog, the government should halt pilots of telephone and internet voting until they are more secure. Trials went ahead in May's local polls in Rushmoor, Sheffield, Shrewsbury and Atcham, South Buckinghamshire and Swindon. \"There was insufficient time available to implement and plan the pilots, and the quality assurance and testing was undertaken too late and lacked sufficient depth,\" the commission says in an evaluation. Broadly, the trials were a success, it says, but there were problems including accessibility, public understanding of the process and technical problems, especially in Swindon, where many voters could not be connected properly. The commission says that no further e-voting should be commissioned until the government introduces \"a comprehensive electoral modernisation strategy, outlining how transparency, public trust and cost effectiveness can be achieved\". There were also problems with electronic counting systems. In three of the six places they were piloted this year - Breckland, Stratford-on-Avon and Warwick - the electronic count was abandoned in favour of a manual one, and in two others, Bedford and South Buckinghamshire, there were serious problems: \"Testing was undertaken too late and lacked sufficient depth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
