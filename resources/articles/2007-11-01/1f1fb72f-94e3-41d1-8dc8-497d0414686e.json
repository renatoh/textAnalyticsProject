Warm words about the importance of science and innovation to the continent's economy and development are voiced regularly by both western and African governments, and more will be heard this week as the African Ministerial Council of Science and Technology meets in Mombasa for its third conference. Noah Wekesa, Kenya's minister of science, technology and innovation, who takes over leadership of Amcost at the conference, has stated that \"the only way we can empower citizens is to embrace science and technology\", and has promised to encourage African governments to meet their goal of allocating 1% of gross domestic product to science. The words have been just as warm from the west, which made pledges at the 2005 G8 meeting in Gleneagles to support training, innovation and research as part of its commitment to increase aid to Africa . Firm outcomes from any of these promises have proved more elusive. The latest newsletter from Research Africa, a consortium that disseminates research as a tool for sustainable development, raises concerns about African countries' abilities to meet their commitments to science, and calls on G8 countries to start putting their money where their mouths are. But while more has certainly been said than done, it is not all hot air, according to Andy Cherry, science and technology adviser of the Africa Unit, Association of Commonwealth Universities. \"G8 countries have not been doing as much as they could,\" he says, \"But they are doing more than they did in the past.\" And this is in spite of the fact that Africa seems to be expecting less. Wekesa has insisted that only once the continent has sorted out its own funding for science can it expect other countries to help. \"Africa is now taking responsibility for itself,\" says Cherry. \"Donors can sit back and say we don't want to do anything until Africa does it first. Africa is tired of being led by donors' agendas.\" This change does create difficulties for those involved in supporting science and technology in Africa, because it is harder to know who should make decisions. Some schemes, such as the UK-government funded England Africa Partnership Scheme to build links between African and English higher education institutions, have sparked criticism for failing to include enough African involvement in the way they are organised, says Cherry. Similarly, the idea of funding centres of excellence in Africa, proposed by the Commission for Africa, which was appointed by former prime minister Tony Blair and supported at Gleneagles, has caused a more muted response in Africa. The concern is that such centres could suck in all expertise in a particular field to a single location, draining it from the rest of the continent. This highlights another hotly debated issue. Should decisions abut science be made locally, by individual African countries, or collectively as a continent? \"Most of the problems that need to be solved by science and technology are local,\" says Calestous Juma, professor of the practice of development at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, suggesting that initiatives funded at a continental level tend to be driven by donor's interests. He argues that only once domestic support for science is established can wider collaborative programmes develop. Certainly, while the poverty of many African countries means they can sometimes lack clout as individual states, it is not going to be easy to get commitments to firm action from 53 countries, all at different stages of development. Ironically, the G8 has faced similar problems in acting collectively, with some countries, such as the UK and Japan, going much further to fulfil the G8 pledges than others. In Africa, the issue of local versus continental programmes of action relates not only to decision-making about resources for science, but to their distribution. Donor countries are nervous about giving large sums to individual governments in countries that are unstable or at risk of corruption. Hence efforts to create an African science and innovation fund as a mechanism for mobilising and directing resources, although agreement on how to organise it is proving difficult. In spite of these difficulties, the advantages for Africa of developing its research and science base are clear. It helps to create jobs, and a skilled workforce to fill them, and it helps directly with development, in terms of tackling issues such as climate change, disease and hunger. But there are also advantages for other countries. First, there is the need to include Africa in solving global problems such as climate change. Where better to research drought-resistant crops, for example? Second, a globalised world cannot afford to ignore the intellectual resources of a whole continent. Western universities are already realising the academic opportunities and intellectual stimulation offered by exchanges and partnerships with African institutions. Juma predicts that some are likely to open their own campuses in Africa, just as they are increasingly doing in Asia. Then there is economic competitiveness. Donor countries that establish strong links with a country that is thriving in terms of innovation and skills are likely to benefit from future trading links. \"The UK wants Africa to see it as a major trading partner and the aid budget is not just for altruistic purposes,\" says Cherry. \"There is a strong element of increasing UK competitiveness.\" In fact, G8 countries may soon find they cannot afford not to help Africa, which is already looking to China and India as alternative sources of support. \"African countries are starting to choose their friends on the basis of their commitment to building Africa's scientific and technological capabilities,\" says Juma. \"Science in Africa is going to advance irrespective of G8 funding.\" He argues that it would be better for the G8 to abandon the practice of making pledges that cannot be kept and instead work on pragmatic partnerships involving universities, industry and other players. But the fact that debate now focuses on how, rather than whether, Africa should be supporting innovation, shows that these pledges have achieved some purpose. And if the momentum continues, goodwill could turn to gold for everyone concerned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
