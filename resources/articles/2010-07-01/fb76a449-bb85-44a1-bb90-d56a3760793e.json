It has taken the Financial Services Authority five years of study to reach the conclusion that self-certification mortgages are bad news and something should be done to curtail their spread. At least the regulator got there in the end: a ban is in sight. The case against self-cert loans rests simply on the evidence of the past few years. The product became too hot for lenders to handle with care. Levels of mortgage fraud are too high and arrears rates run at three times the level experienced in mortgages where the lender has bothered to check income. Insisting on verification is a reasonable response. Parts of the lending industry will complain that credit-worthy self-employed folk will be penalised. In some cases, this will indeed be a temporary effect \u2013 the recently self-employed will have to demonstrate a record of income to enter the mortgage market. But, as long as the FSA doesn't insist that records must be established over many years, this drawback looks minor. Self-employed plumbers should still be able to get mortgages. But lashing out at liar loans is the easy bit. The controversial \u2013 and more far-reaching \u2013 aspect of the regulator's blast concerns interest-only mortgages. The proposed rule here is that affordability must be assessed on a capital and interest basis. In other words, don't apply for an interest-only mortgage if you can't afford a repayment mortgage. You can understand why the FSA is bothered about interest-only mortgages. If borrowers are not repaying capital, they are really just paying rent to the bank. That's fine when house prices are rising and interest rates are low. But when prices are falling and rates are rising, danger looms for borrower and lender alike. If the lender's likely ability to repay the capital were established at the outset, at least there would be a stabiliser in the system. What's not to like about that? Well, don't expect applause from cash-strapped 20-somethings looking to buy their first house. Taking on an interest-only mortgage will seem an attractive gamble when the alternative is paying real rent to a real landlord \u2013 after all, you get to enjoy the capital gain when house prices rise. Why, many will argue, should Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, interfere with people's right to make that bet? The answer, Turner suggests in a speech today, is that society faces a trade-off: the financial system can be made safer but at the expense of less easy access to credit. The bad news for those ambitious 20-somethings is that his analysis is correct: tighter credit conditions are inevitable if we wish to avoid damaging boom-to-bust property binges fuelled by loose lending standards. It's not a popular tune to sing, but it's honest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
