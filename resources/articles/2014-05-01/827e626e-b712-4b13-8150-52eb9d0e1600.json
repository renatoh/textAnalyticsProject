The name refers to the 19th-century physics experiment that paved the way for relativity, and liberating flexibilities of time and space certainly characterise McMurchie's fine first album as a composer/leader. The lineup (with Mark Whitlam on percussion and electronics and Will Harris on double bass) might be tight, but the repertoire is wide \u2013 from the growling, deep-groove repetition of Rice Rage, through the quiet, electronics-shaded modulations of the title track, some Steve Reichian minimalism and the Ornette-meets-Lovano freebop of Cross-Stream Roundtrip Time, to the ghostly, Nordic ambiance of Wish I Knew. The compositions are imaginative and the collective creativity gives the set an unapologetically jazz-rooted feel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
