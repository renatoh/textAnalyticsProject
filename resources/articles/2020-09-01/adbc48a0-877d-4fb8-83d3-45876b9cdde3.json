This is not the same as admitting defeat, but it is to say: \u201cFine, you are untouchable when you do that, let\u2019s move on to the next point.\u201d Ulster\u2019s Jacob Stockdale is already established as one of the world\u2019s best wings, but last Saturday when Cheslin Kolbe came at him with ball in hand he reacted very much as tennis players used to when a Goran Ivanisevic serve flew past. He let Kolbe go. Why make a fool of yourself trying to stop it? Next point. That was when Kolbe scored the second of his two tries for Toulouse as they dispatched Ulster in the quarter-final of the Champions Cup. The Ireland international stuck out an arm and appeared to stroke Kolbe\u2019s midriff with his flailing fingers as the South African stepped past him, but it was with the futility of a condemned man. Something similar had occurred with Kolbe\u2019s first try, only that time Stockdale did not manage even to stroke him with those fingers. At least he looked as if he was trying, as he raced across to stop the unstoppable. The innocence of a first encounter, two minutes in. By the time of that second one, two minutes before the interval, Stockdale looked as if he had aged. This is what happens when people play against Kolbe. Ulster are in good company. Many credit rugby\u2019s pre-eminent sidestepper with breathing new life into Toulouse, whom he joined in 2017 and inspired to their first French title for seven years. Then, of course, his try in the World Cup final in Yokohama last year, when Owen Farrell was the hapless returner of serve, sealed South Africa\u2019s third world title. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, as he muses over his unplayable stepping, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I do on the field. It\u2019s just my body taking over. I surprise myself.\u201d Kolbe confirms the instinct of the sidestep is so strong in him that it has formed part of his daily routine for as long as he can remember. \u201cTo take it way back, at home, whenever I had to take a shower or to get something from the fridge, if I ran into another room, I\u2019d make sure I sidestep into it.\u201d His genes are likely to have played their part, too. His father, Andrew, was a talented player who might have progressed as far as his son but for the apartheid years. Andrew\u2019s sister, Odessa, was a sprinter similarly disadvantaged by the old regime and her son, Kolbe\u2019s cousin, is Wayde van Niekerk, the 400m Olympic champion and world-record holder. That the current generation of the family is enjoying such success, as the new era releases more and more talent from those previously oppressed, is not only cathartic for the family but also for the community from which they emerged in the north-eastern suburbs of Cape Town. \u201cI play this game to create a lot of hope, to inspire those people in my community not to fall into the trap of gangsters and drugs. I have a purpose each and every morning I wake up,\u201d Kolbe says. \u201cIt\u2019s why I do this.\u201d Kolbe and his cousin used to spur each other on from a young age, not only on the track but in the school rugby team, where Kolbe at scrum-half would feed Van Niekerk at fly-half and a try would follow as surely as an ace from Ivanisevic\u2019s racket. But at times there was also a primeval urge honing their talents \u2013 that of survival. \u201cIn our community, whenever you do play in the street, a gang war or a shooting can break out, so you normally just run for your life. \u201cThat\u2019s where the speed and everything comes from, trying to avoid getting shot or that kind of thing.\u201d Speed and stepping have been the making of Kolbe, even as he deploys those skills now to bring success to his teams and hope to his people. Jack Nowell, another old mate from Junior World Cup days, and his Exeter teammates know they will face quite the task at Sandy Park on Saturday trying to thwart Toulouse\u2019s quest for a first European title in 10 years. To succeed they will almost certainly have to stop Kolbe finding space. Once that happens even the best tend to be left waiting for the restart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
