Without the fix, a failure of the second module might force the ISS to be abandoned. The first spacewalk is to begin at 12:10 on Saturday, 21 December, with further ones on Monday and, if necessary, on Christmas Day. The ISS, with its six all-male crew at present, is now conspicuous as it crosses eastwards in Britain's evening sky. The tables show predictions of its path as seen from London and Manchester, with asterisks marking the directions in which it disappears into eclipse in the Earth's shadow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
