Previous research by Citizens Advice has suggested consumers are losing \u00a33.3bn a year as a result of misleading and aggressive practices, and consumer affairs minister Jo Swinson said \"murky\" rules were allowing rogue traders to target vulnerable and elderly people. The new rules, announced on Tuesday by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, cover purchases including insurance, timeshares and home improvements. The changes are being made through amendments to consumer protection regulations. Further measures to improve consumer protection through a new raft of legislation are being introduced through a new Consumer Rights Bill, set to become law in 2015. Swinson said: \"We want consumers to be confident to shop with a range of traders and to drive rogues out of business. The new rights announced today will mean consumers are entitled to the same level of protection whether they are purchasing goods or services online, at home or in a shop. The change were welcomed by the consumer group Which? and the charity Citizens Advice. Citizens Advice's chief executive, Gillian Guy, said : \"Citizens Advice helps with over 77,000 problems with misleading claims and pressure selling a year. A beefed-up approach to tackling misleading and aggressive practices is desperately needed and will be a step towards protecting people from bullying businesses.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
