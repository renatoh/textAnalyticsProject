The 27-year-old is a national hero in his homeland, where all the games were televised live by the state broadcaster, NRK, and the Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, made the ceremonial first move. Fischer Random, also called Chess960, is a variant invented by the legendary Bobby Fischer where the starting position of the pieces on the back ranks is randomised. In effect this prevents memorised openings and forces the players to rely on their own talent and creativity. The play proved tricky and combative and Carlsen liked it: \u201cChess is science, art and sport. With Fischer Random you take away the science part. The match showed that it\u2019s not too weird and it leads to chess without theory yet still at a reasonable level\u201d. Two of the games will be remembered for unique incidents. They were playing without per-move clock increments, 45 minutes for 40 moves then 15 minutes to complete. In game eight Carlsen mishandled a won position and it came down to rook and bishop against rook, a draw with best play though in practice often won by the rook-bishop. Carlsen had only a minute left but refused several Nakamura offers of a rook trade and an immediate draw. He meant to claim a draw in his last few seconds, which the arbiter was ready to agree, but in the heat of frantic blitz moves misjudged the time and overstepped. Perhaps this is the only time that rook and bishop versus rook has been won by the rook. A special rule for the start position in Fischer Random is that the two rooks must be either side of the king, allowing a variant of castling. When the randomising computer produced a set-up with the kings on f1/f8 and a rook on g1/g8, they took the opportunity to create a historic first, and the game began 1 0-0, 0-0, castling on move one. Guildford continued to dominate at the latest weekend in the UK\u2019s 4NCL league. The Surrey club has won all its six matches between 7-1 and 8-0, without loss of a single game. Mark Hebden, a Guildford team regular, who celebrated his 60th birthday this week, was a prolific openings innovator during the golden era of English chess in the 1970s and 1980s. The Leicester GM still seeks fresh ideas and his win below starts with a new wrinkle, 7 f3, in the Barry Attack (Nc3 and Bf4 against the King\u2019s Indian) which he originated. The database shows only two other 7 f3 games, both recent Hebden wins. Time will tell whether the new plan, to support a quick g2-g4, can rival the normal 7 0-0-0. Black\u2019s plan here of a central counter 10...e5 was logical if he had followed up by 11...Nfd7, but instead he blundered a piece and resigned when Hebden\u2019s army homed in on the black king.
