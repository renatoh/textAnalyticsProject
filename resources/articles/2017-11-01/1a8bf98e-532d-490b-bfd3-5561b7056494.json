Wawrzyniak came to the UK 15 years ago before rising to prominence on the BBC showing Mary Berry how to make his signature \u201cbabka\u201d cake but these days he has more than recipes on his mind: specifically the challenge of finding trained staff for his House of Feasts and another restaurant that he plans to open in London next year. \u201cWe are struggling at the moment to find staff because of Brexit \u2013 there is no doubt,\u201d said Wawrzyniak, who recently switched entirely to hiring trainees and teaming up with Peterborough Regional College to run an apprenticeship scheme. EU citizens make up a quarter of the 3 million workers in hospitality, according to a report by professional services firm KPMG. That includes 75% of waiting staff and 25% of chefs. As the clock ticks down to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, senior figures in Britain\u2019s hospitality sector are warning that staff shortages brought about by an exodus of European workers, and a dearth of new arrivals post-Brexit, is a crisis in the making for an industry that is Britain\u2019s fourth-biggest employer. The squeeze is being felt all over the country, from booming northern \u201cdestination towns\u201d such as York and Harrogate to London, at a time when consumer demand shows no sign of dropping off, notwithstanding Brexit-related anxieties. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the party has ended,\u201d said David Strauss, general manager of Goodman Restaurants group, which runs a string of steakhouses and eateries including Burger and Lobster. Five of its senior managers from EU backgrounds are in the process of leaving to go to Canada and Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s been a boom in the last 10 years in restaurants and it\u2019s still carrying on, but we\u2019re seeing people now look at the future and thinking \u2018it\u2019s not going to get much better here\u2019. \u201cWe rely on young people really in central London \u2013 mainly from the EU \u2013 and a lot have never really been in love with the way of life, weather and the expense, so if they can move they would and other countries are opening up to them now. They\u2019re looking, for example, at Paris, where it looks like the labour laws might change and where the culture of one-dimensional restaurants is ripe for change.\u201d Some outlets are already closing on certain days due to staff shortages. Others are pulling down shutters, choosing to take a hit on continuing to pay rental costs. Factors such as property price inflation, a weak pound and the upward cost of ingredients which are traded on the international market \u2013 butter is a case in point \u2013 are backing many in the hospitality sector into a corner. Britain\u2019s sophisticated mid-market restaurant chain scene is likely to have the flexibility to weather the storm, but some independents may fall by the wayside. The alarm bells are also being sounded by companies ranging from the sandwich chain Pret A Manger, which says it would find it virtually impossible to find enough staff if it were forced to turn its back on EU nationals after Brexit, through to the pizza chain Franco Manca, which warned this summer that it is already becoming harder to recruit staff. There is also concern among companies that have made positive noises about Brexit. While arguing that Brexit was bringing a \u201cgreater sense of accountability and self-responsibility in the UK\u201d Leon\u2019s chief executive, John Vincent, has also expressed concerns about being able to hire and retain staff and admitted that many of them were upset by the referendum result. As the Brexit process grinds along, the hospitality sector\u2019s representatives have warned that government plans for the introduction of new qualifications in 2022, as part of efforts to create an army of British-born waiters, chefs and baristas, will come far too late. The result, according to the British Hospitality Association (BHA), could be that hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes across the UK go to the wall. \u201cWe\u2019re a labour-intensive industry so if you don\u2019t have a chef, for example, there is no restaurant. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Ufi Ibrahim, the BHA\u2019s chief executive, who said the problem was acute in London and the south-east but was being experienced across the country. \u201cThere is grave concern in rural areas, for example, where public transport is lacking. Being able to find individuals \u2013 either British workers or others who would be restricted by access \u2013 is a problem. We also have a culture of restricted social mobility. It\u2019s very difficult to see what contingency plans could be put into place to serve in the timelines that have currently been given.\u201d The Department For Education said: \u201cWe are transforming technical education so that young people have the skills and knowledge that employers and the country need.\u201d A new \u201cT-level\u201d system, which overhauls how technical education is taught and administered, will be introduced from 2020. The BHA\u2019s concerns were shared by individual business owners, larger chains and town authorities. At the Chestnut Group, which operates six restaurants, pubs and hotels across rural Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, various moves are already being made to make the sector more attractive to employees. A 10% stake is being given away to its 140 staff, who can also use an app to swap shifts. \u201cHiring in the sector is not easy so we\u2019ve set out to address it in every way, whether it\u2019s to do with helping people find the hours that work for them, or providing training with our own academy,\u201d said chief executive officer Philip Turner. Britain\u2019s new boom towns are among those with particular challenges when it comes to a shortage of catering workers for key positions such as chefs. One example is thriving York, which attracts some 6.9 million visitors a year, generating the demand for a string of major new hotels and restaurants. The company, which promotes the city on behalf of its council, plans a marketing campaign next year to attract talent, including chefs. Some similar issues are in play in nearby Harrogate, where the cost of living has exacerbated recruitment challenges. \u201cTimes are tougher [in recruiting] and there has been a noticeable change in the last 12 months alone,\u201d said Simon Cotton, group managing director in Harrogate at the HRH group of hotels. \u201cHow much is driven by Brexit or by the economy getting better I am not sure but most of our businesses are performing better so we need more people. \u201cThe risk is that there will be a lengthy gap of many years between what the government wants to do and then achieving that, so as an industry we are going to have to do something ourselves. In the meantime it becomes an employees\u2019 market, not a employer\u2019s one. I am seeing this in almost all the businesses I am running. It\u2019s a sense that \u2018if I don\u2019t get the perks and pay rises I want then I can walk around the corner to the next job\u2019.\u201d Gordon Ramsay told the Radio Times last month that an \u201cinflux\u201d of multinational workers had \u201cconfirmed how lazy as a nation we are\u201d. Changes such as curbs on foreign labour were a \u201cbig kick up the ass\u201d for the industry, said Ramsay who looked forward to a focus on \u201cmodern-day apprenticeship\u201d and on homegrown talent. Ramsay\u2019s views were characteristically acerbic. But across the board there is a belief that the benefits of working in a sector that can offer a range of benefits including good pay, opportunities to travel and career advancement are not being adequately sold to young Britons, or perhaps realised by them. Will Beckett, co-founder of the Hawksmoor restaurant chain, said: \u201cThere are some cultural issues at play and certainly there is a perception that the restaurant industry is not a particularly attractive proposition, or that some young Brits are not up for the type of work involved. \u201cMy experience of British people is that they will work extremely hard not just in managerial roles but as kitchen porters or similar positions.\u201d In a city where EU workers make up the backbone of hospitality staff, Hawksmoor stands somewhat apart in that a substantial proportion \u2013 more than 40% \u2013 of its workers are British. Beckett emphasises the need to make staff feel valued: \u201cThe restaurant industry is character. You have to really be prepared to pitch in and British people will do that, although they like to know why and for what wider purpose.\u201d Damian Wawrzyniak is as well placed as anyone to judge the work ethics of British and Polish workers. \u201cI can\u2019t say that there is a difference between the Polish and British. It doesn\u2019t matter what nationality you are. If someone does not want to work then they won\u2019t work,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
