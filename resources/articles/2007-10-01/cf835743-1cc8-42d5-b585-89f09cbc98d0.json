And this grumpiness towards awards for authors seems to be spreading across the month. On the eve of the 2007 Man Booker prize this week, thriller writer Robert Harris described these would-be British Oscars for novelists as \"evil\", accusing judges of stacking the short list with unreadable and unread books selected by criteria of liberal guilt. Some reports of Anne Enright's victory with The Gathering noted that her book was \"bleak and depressing\" and \"not a bestseller\". Even a beneficiary of the Man Booker - Ian McEwan, winner in 1998 and short-listed several times, including this year - has proposed a significant makeover, arguing that short lists should be abandoned, with the judges simply declaring a winner on the day, as happens with the Nobel. This would reduce the sense of authors being tipped and backed like horses. This chorus of doubts suggests that the Man Booker has reached a crisis of credibility and relevance. The same has happened to its artistic near-equivalent, the Turner prize, which is also facing accusations of being out of touch. But the objections of Harris, the media and McEwan all misunderstand the purpose of the Man Booker (and indeed the Turner), which is to promote the kind of work which audiences are reluctant to find otherwise. Gloating references to Enright's book having \"only sold three thousand\" miss the point that an originally written novel might have vanished completely without the prize. Many writers who are now bestsellers - McEwan, Julian Barnes, Margaret Atwood - all gained attention by failing to win the Booker. It's because of the award's power to promote literature that receives no other publicity that the organisers have moved in the opposite direction to that proposed by McEwan, releasing a \"long list\" of up to 20 books, from which the six finalists are picked. McEwan's proposition ignores the fact that the award is a marketing device for fiction that doesn't get an advertising budget. More worrying is that beneath this undercurrent of grumbling is the philistine assumption that it is elitist or irrelevant to consider art which does not excite the mass market. At a dinner party in middle England, someone said to me: \"Apparently Orhan Pamuk has won the Nobel prize for literature? Well, I found his books pretty hard-going.\" Well, perhaps. But it is the Nobel prize for literature rather than entertainment. Almost all art now considered significant could have been condemned at its inception for being \"out of touch\" with the bourgeoisie of the period. Admittedly, these divisions can be too strict, with the snobbery applied in reverse by judges. It's a stain on the Nobel literature committee's reputation that it failed to honour Graham Greene and seems likely to repeat its mistake with John Le Carr\u00e9, Greene's successor as a writer who captures the geopolitics of an era within attractive narratives. Even so, media culture is more culpable in only acknowledging art that sells. What has happened is that the spread of market economics across most political shadings has encouraged scepticism about cultural subsidy, whether it's the BBC licence fee or Arts Council grants. The result is that works of art are judged by the weight of public interest. Some of this may be my fault. For two decades I've written columns and presented programmes that treat popular and unpopular culture as equally worthy of discussion. I've interviewed Howard Hodgkin and Beryl Cook, Seamus Heaney and Pam Ayres, Orhan Pamuk and Robert Harris, Edward Albee and Ray Cooney. Yet despite this catholicity of interests I would not confuse equal time on arts shows with equality of achievement. The logic of most current media coverage of artistic prizes, however, leads to a culture where Cook wins the Turner, Harris dukes it out with Ayres for the Nobel, and the National Theatre revives Cooney's See How They Run rather than Albee's A Delicate Balance. That would clearly be madness. An artist stands in a wood where, as Robert Frost had it, two roads diverge. One path - smooth and brightly lit - winds through entertainment, optimism and simplicity. The other - dark and densely tangled - leads to bleakness, experiment and sentiments which many will consider unspeakable or unreadable. At the end of the first road lie adulation, mansions and fame. The second track can lead to a daily post which contains more letters from the bank than readers. Occasional figures combine literary originality with popular appeal - Pinter, Stoppard, Le Carr\u00e9, Roth - but most will find themselves in one part of the wood or the other. Artistic prizes and grants are a compensation. Complaining that Booker or Nobel winners aren't bestsellers misses the point. Attractive as the freeway of populism may be, we need some artists to take the roads less travelled by. And the Man Booker and Turner are the AA and RAC of that journey. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
