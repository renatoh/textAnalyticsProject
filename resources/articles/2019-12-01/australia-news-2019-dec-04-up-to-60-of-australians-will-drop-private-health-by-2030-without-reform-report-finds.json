The report, led by the health economist Stephen Duckett, recommended partially deregulating premiums to allow insurers to charge younger people less than older people for the same level of coverage, but said premiums should remain regulated and should not vary by age for people 55 and over. \u201cThe system faces a death spiral \u2013 younger and healthier consumers get a bad deal so they\u2019re dropping their insurance, which means premiums need to rise, so even more young and healthy people drop out, and the cycle continues,\u201d the report, published on Tuesday night, said. \u201cThis youth exodus means the recent moderation of premium increases is likely to end, and premiums will probably return to increasing at 5% or more each year. Young people\u2019s premiums have to get cheaper.\u201d The report proposed a number of other reforms, including redirecting the private hospital insurance rebate towards older patients. The report also recommended that the rebate not be increased, it be withdrawn from low-coverage policies, and the \u201cextras\u201d insurance rebate be withdrawn. \u201cPart of the proceeds should fund dental care and part should keep hospital insurance premiums for older people at acceptable levels,\u201d it said. The chair of the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the proposed reforms were not substantial and would merely \u201ctweak the numbers\u201d to make insurance slightly more attractive to young people. \u201cMy biggest criticism is that the paper assumes that the current system of private health insurance is a system worth saving which, in my opinion, is not the case,\u201d Doggett, a health policy analyst, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t address many of the fundamental problems with private health insurance: that it is overly complex, cost-inflationary, has high administrative costs, leads to over-servicing, is inequitable, doesn\u2019t help those most in need, and disadvantages people in rural areas \u2013 although some of these issues are addressed in other Grattan papers.\u201d For the reforms to succeed, enough young people would have to join to effectively cross-subsidise the cost of older people. Consumer behaviour in this area was difficult to predict accurately as people\u2019s decisions about private health insurance and healthcare were not often economically rational. \u201cThe paper relies on some significant assumptions about how young people will respond to the reforms. If these are wrong, the changes are not going to have the effect they predict,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cHowever, redirecting the dental component of the rebate into public dental services is a positive as this would deliver much better value \u2013 although overall the removal of the rebate from ancillary services means that the out-of-pocket costs for allied health and dental services are likely to rise.\u201d Catholic Health Australia\u2019s chief executive, Pat Garcia, said deregulating premiums for those under 55 would mean \u201cjunking a fundamental tenet of Australia\u2019s health system\u201d. This risked increasing premiums for young people with chronic disease and mental health issues, leading to those with chronic disease dropping their private health insurance and moving into the public system. \u201cThis is the last thing public hospitals need right now.\u201d The chief executive of Private Healthcare Australia, Dr Rachel David, said health funds were prevented from discriminating against members based on health status or claims history. \u201cThe latest report from the Grattan Institute highlighted issues of concern in the private health sector previously identified by government and stakeholders, however it failed to offer any workable solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile maintaining a system of community rating \u2013 [which means the same service is available to everyone for the same price] \u2013 posed challenges for Australia\u2019s health system, it was also one of the features which helped Australia maintain its international reputation for fairness in healthcare. \u201cCommunity rating underpins Australia\u2019s private health insurance regulations, and changes to a risk-rated system would severely destabilise premiums for older Australians and threaten the future of fair and equitable healthcare. \u201cGenerational transfer of risk would mean a lot of Australians would have a very uncertain future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
