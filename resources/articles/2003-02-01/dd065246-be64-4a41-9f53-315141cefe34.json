The house is now worth about \u00a3200,000, and I have been told that if I sell I will be liable for capital gains tax. If this is the case? Good news. You should not have to pay any CGT. You get 'private residence relief' from CGT on your home for the time that you are living in it. You also qualify for this relief for the last three years you own it. So if you sell before April 2004, you should be clear of CGT. You would otherwise have needed to use your annual CGT allowance of \u00a37,700 (in the current tax year) to shield that amount of the gain. Any gain over that would be taxed at your marginal rate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
