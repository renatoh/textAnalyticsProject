Even so, news that an American hedge fund, led by a 32-year-old, has blown $4bn, or a shade over \u00a32bn, in little more than a week is extraordinary. This sort of thing was no longer supposed to be possible in the grown-up, responsible world of hedge funds. Events at Amaranth Advisors, which appears to have lost almost half its capital in a huge bet that US natural gas prices would rise, show two things. First, the cult of the star trader is alive. Second, supposedly sophisticated investors, including banks, are willing to hand over vast sums with little guarantee about how they will be managed. You and I wouldn't do it. But they do. Brian Hunter, Amaranth's star energy trader, was based in Calgary in Canada, far away from Wall Street. His bet seems remarkably unsophisticated. It may have been as plain as thinking the Caribbean hurricane season would push gas even higher. Well, there hasn't been a big hurricane so far, and prices have reversed. Anybody can make a bad trade, but Amaranth was not supposed to be risking so much on a single bet. In the hedge fund jargon, it is a multi-strategy fund. It was meant to be pursuing a range of trading techniques and to be investing in many markets. Instead, it bet half the ranch on a hunch about one commodity. That this was even possible is the amazing part. Amaranth's investors appear to have given Hunter and his traders enormous leeway. As long as the fund was showing a profit - and it had been - they took things on trust. Thankfully, Amaranth is not typical. Most hedge funds are in the mundane, almost dreary, business of trying to eke out returns of 1% or 2% a month. Most stick to their scripts, but there will always be those that don't. Every blow-up brings calls for regulators to take greater interest in hedge funds. At times like this, it's hard to disagree. It isn't another LTCM, but it's suddenly easier to see how that story could be revisited. Prize rabbits You won't catch Aberdeen-based Venture Productions pondering the mysteries of Kremlin politics, as BP and shell have to do. It has a simple strategy. Forget about looking for new oil and gas fields - concentrate on producing the stuff you know is there. Don't even do this in exotic locations. There's plenty left under the North Sea. Venture's speciality is \"stranded\" reserves - fields that are too small, or too tricky, for the big boys to bother with. The chief executive, Mike Wagstaff, calls it \"rabbit hunting\", as opposed to the pursuit of elephant-sized fields that is the goal of most explorers from Exxon downwards. You need more rabbits to survive, but they're easier to bag. In the US and the Gulf of Mexico, such production-led independents are 10-a-penny, but over here, they're rare. That's partly because the North Sea, where production peaked six years ago, is viewed as unexciting territory. It's also because UK oil investors seem addicted to thrills. The allure is to spot the next Cairn Energy, which hit the jackpot in the Rajasthan desert. Venture's thrill-free strategy has other attractions. The company is suddenly throwing off cash -about \u00a3155m in the first half of this year, it said yesterday. After its latest acquisition, it's on course to be producing 70,000 barrels a day. You have to wonder whether the market has properly woken up to the possibilities. Venture is worth \u00a3900m, but that's less than four times next year's expected cash flow. A collapse in the oil price would change that measure, of course, but in the oil game, they say, it pays to back managements. This one has grown the company from scratch with barely a hiccup. It's an interesting punt. Almost well done There goes another \u00a3500m from Treasury coffers. British Energy fell another 8% yesterday as it gave warning for the second time in two months that output from its nuclear plants would be lower than expected. More urgent repairs are needed to the boilers at Hunterston. These old boilers are proving expensive for the taxpayer. It was in the March budget that Gordon Brown said he was \"minded\" to sell the state's 65% stake in the company. If he had done so this summer, before the two profit warnings, he could have raised maybe \u00a31.5bn more than he'll get now. It doesn't change the fact that the rescue of British Energy - thanks to booming electricity prices - was smart. But Gordon was on the verge of brilliance, almost picking both the bottom and top of the market. Too late now. \u00b7 nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
