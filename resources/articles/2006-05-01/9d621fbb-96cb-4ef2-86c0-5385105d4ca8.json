But the new South Africa is in many ways even stranger than the old, and nothing shows it more embarrassingly than the trial of Jacob Zuma, the former vice president of South Africa, on the charge of raping a family friend. When Alan Drury wrote of our strangeness, he was thinking of the old South Africa, of racial persecution and of effortless cruelty, laced with the sorts of absurdities that took the top of your head off if you thought about them too much. A world on the far side of sanity. The trial is over and Jacob Zuma has been acquitted. But that is not the end of the story. It is not the beginning, either, because violence in South Africa is at the heart of this case and violence is so pervasive, and so fundamental to the way people react to each other, that I sometimes think that hitting, shooting or raping are the terrifying means by which South Africans stay in touch. The only way they stay in touch. The Zuma trial in these past weeks has laid bare, again, the awful underside of what passes, terrifyingly, for \"normal\" life. Terrifying because this is how it is for a lot of the time, though of course, we prefer not to say so. The accuser of Jacob Zuma, a 31-year-old family friend, was HIV-positive, and in the course of the trial it was she who seemed to be in the dock, she who had to explain and defend her sexual history. Outside the court, meanwhile, crowds of people in Zulu beadwork and Zuma T-shirts proclaimed their devotion to the big man JZ, our home-grown \"Zulu Boy\", while cheerfully calling for her head. Intimidation? Yes, but of a peculiarly South African kind - fear-mongering dolled up in its scary festive best. \"Burn the bitch!\" demanded the dancers in the streets, and as they danced, waving mock AK47s, they were holding up pictures of the woman who had dared to bring the rape charge. And, often, after another round in court, the accused would join his supporters in the hit song Awulethu Umshini Wam (Bring Me My Machine Gun). What was to have been a trial about possible rape was revved up into a political rally, with supporters of Zuma bussed to Johannesburg all the way from Kwa-Zulu Natal, hundreds of miles away. The idea being to frighten and then destroy those who oppose you - the philosophy at the heart of traditional South African politics, new and old, even if those struggles sometimes play out as revolutions or rugby matches or rape trials. It is not surprising that supporters of the woman who brought the charge of rape, from organisations such as the One-in-Nine Campaign, and a group called Powa (People Opposing Women Abuse), were sometimes led away by the police , fearful for their safety. What they had to say was quite obliterated by an army of Zuma supporters; they were outplayed, you might say, and certainly outgunned. This was a pity because what such people were trying to say was that there is too much rape in South Africa, too many murders, a plague of violence. One in nine is said to be the number of rapes actually reported to the police. Like all statistics, this is probably wrong; and the best way to express the stratospheric figures of rape and other forms of violence, especially against women and children, would be to say simply that they are much too high. To use other figures, again, almost certain to be hopelessly inaccurate, it is thought that a woman or a child is raped every 26 seconds. These figures may be terrifying but all they do is to is to feed the general feeling of helplessness in the face of the seemingly insatiable energy in and among South Africans for violence in all forms. And, besides, statistics do not lend themselves to singing and dancing, and they do not carry guns. In law, Zuma's accuser may not be named, but that doesn't help. She has been named, often, her identity is no secret and she was and is under police protection. But it will not help much now that the case is over. Her family home has been attacked twice and the woman herself burnt in effigy. The fury directed at Zuma's accuser was, in part, because she had had the gall to bring a charge against a popular leader but also because she was seen as being in cahoots with those forces Zuma and others believe are out to destroy him - Thabo Mbeki, and an anti-Zuma faction within the ruling party. Zuma's fans had a message for Mbeki. \"Tell him,\" they said in the streets outside the courthouse, \"that we are sick of him, tell him that. Tell him we still believe JZ will be president.\" There are those who say such a thing is now impossible. But they don't know how persuasive messages are when delivered with an AK47. Politics in my country may be described as big talk backed by even bigger guns. The acquittal was a famous victory for the former vice-president. He was cleared of all charges and his accuser dismissed as a fantasist. Though Judge van der Merwe had some harsh things to say about unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, he did not remark on the fact that Zuma, when vice president, was in charge of the moral regeneration of the nation or that he once headed up the South African National Aids Council. He did, however, revisit Rudyard Kipling's poem If, and told Zuma that he had been rather reckless. Self-control was the answer, said the judge. \"And if you can control your body and your sexual urges, then you are a man, my son.\" What did not get the attention it deserved was that the woman in court had been raped three times before: when she was five, at 13, and again at 14. Nor did the judge dwell too much on the bizarre nature of Zuma's defence. He testified that far from being a sexual attack on his part, the woman had been determined to have sex with him, and the niceties of Zulu culture demanded that he comply because not to have done so when the woman so clearly wished him to do so would be regarded, again in Zulu sexual etiquette, as the equivalent of having raped her. As someone who had sometimes satirised South Africa , that sort of thing brings on in me a kind of dazed admiration. How on earth could you make up something like that? South Africa always outstrips its writers. Take that judge. In one of the great tragicomic moments in legal theatre, it turned out that Judge Willem van der Merwe only got the job because no one else would have it. The trial was due to be heard by the Judge President, Bernard Ngoepe. But he said the case was too \"political\" and he'd really rather not. Next up was his deputy, Judge John Magapelo, but he declined the job for \"personal reasons\". Then Judge Jeremiah Shongwe looked like he would be lumbered with it but explained that he couldn't do it either because the whole thing was rather too close to home - Zuma, Shongwe explained, was the father of a child by the judge's sister, some three decades earlier while he had been in exile. Behind it, under it, all around the trial was the question, known and avoided in South Africa - of Aids and its relentless spread. In a country where by some counts six million people carry the virus, and many will succumb, the subject is still a deadly secret. Zuma had sex with an HIV-positive partner and then took a shower. Thabo Mbeki took a look at the science of the virus and simply refused to recognise it. \"We cannot blame everything on a single virus,\" he told a journalist in 2003. There was also poverty, starvation, suicide and substance abuse. \"Personally, I don't know anyone who has died of Aids.\" This is truly a world apart, a very strange society. It does not consider what is but what people say should be, and the race is to the swift and the well-armed. Aids kills more people in South Africa than anywhere else in the world. Yes, it does. And yet the trial of Zuma was not about Aids. Or rape, or violence. It was about power, about the struggle between Zuma and his people and Mbeki and his backers, as to which has the country's interests more truly at heart. Zuma left the court a free man and felt himself to be rather like Christ, crucified by the media and sinister forces who had stitched him up. It is said that the woman at the heart of it has been advised to - and will have to - leave the country. And there is a cruel logic to it. Not just because she may well be in physical danger, but because in a terrible way she is irrelevant to the ongoing struggle for power. Even Zuma's demeanour at his trial underscores how brutal, how dreamy, how weird are those things that pass for normal in South Africa. I will return to the battle against Aids, said Zuma; I will even use my own lapse into unprotected sex as a warning to others not to follow my example. He went on to compare his ordeal to the crucifixion. But it is not Jesus Christ he resembles so much as David Blaine - the great escape artist. With this difference. David Blaine, tied up underwater, failed to escape and had to be rescued. Zuma seems able to defy the laws of gravity - he slipped his chains. And, believe it or not, to many in South Africa he has come up smelling of roses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
