It wasn't as if his appearance was unexpected. An international assembly of journalists had packed the narrow benches for the better part of a day waiting for the 62-year-old IMF boss. It was just that he looked so out of place. Reporters stood and half crouched to get a better look before being ordered to sit down as Strauss-Kahn was brought in from a backroom in handcuffs. The French presidential candidate and alleged sex offender sat on a bench at the back of the room. He seemed to be trying to shrink himself into the corner as he waited his turn before the judge. The proceedings started with a retinal scan, a relatively new procedure that is done in the court room. Strauss-Kahn's cellmates lined up to have their pictures taken first. Some squinted, some widened their eyes as if in shock, some smiled, others looked defiant, one had to lift her long fringe out of the way as the cameraman moved in for her closeup. Strauss-Kahn stared into the lens looking angry, embarrassed and lost. Looking a little like a Gallic Bernard Madoff, Strauss-Kahn wore a black mac and trousers. They would have appeared smart if they didn't look like he had slept in them. There was little evidence of the flair and charisma that led to him being known as \"the great seducer\". Despite his slept-in appearance, DSK was still better dressed than his fellow prisoners. Most were 30-plus years younger than him, black or Latino, wearing baggy jeans and T-shirts and carrying baseball caps. All of the other middle-aged white guys in court were wearing uniforms or scribbling in notebooks. They were free to leave whenever they liked. Most of the accused were on drug charges. Many were sent home on bail, one with a fine of $75, another with a few days' community service. There were moments of humour. One man accused of drug possession was found with a batch of glassine bags \u2013 the packaging of choice for drug merchants. He said he used them to collect buttons. Every seat was taken and no standing was allowed. Relatives of the accused were unable to find a perch, the accused themselves were told to wait in the corridor for their paperwork. Outside the room an international press pack lobbied for entry until eventually the authorities caved and allowed a few to line the walls. Many of the journalists had spent the better part of Sunday waiting for Strauss-Kahn's arraignment and were clearly outstaying their welcome as far as some of the court police were concerned. \"Do they think we should do their jobs for them?\" said one when asked, again, what the judge's name was. Her name is Melissa Jackson, supervising judge for New York county's criminal court. Jackson has overseen many high-profile cases. Earlier this month she imprisoned two men who allegedly plotted to blow up New York synagogues and possibly the Empire State Building. She is not a woman to be messed with. Jackson once got in to an altercation with rapper, and notorious diva, Foxy Brown. Brown had assaulted a neighbour with her Blackberry. \"Counsel, she has gum in her mouth,\" Jackson told Brown's lawyer. The rapper stuck out her tongue to prove she didn't and soon found herself handcuffed to a bench. Brown got feisty with her would be jailers and refused to apologise until Jackson waved the threat of an extra 30-days in jail before her lawyer. Strauss-Kahn stood quietly, head bowed as his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, tried to keep him out of jail. Brafman, too, is used to high-profile cases; his former charges have included Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs and Michael Jackson. But even he looked distracted as a battery of cameramen was allowed in court to take yet more photos Strauss-Kahn is unlikely to be putting on his mantle. Every step of his downfall seems to have been presented as a photo opportunity. In the end Strauss-Kahn's appearance in Manhattan criminal court lasted all of 30 minutes, but it capped a two-day odyssey through the bowels of New York's criminal system. After his arrest late on Saturday he was held in a cell in a special victims' unit in East Harlem as an ever growing press pack waited outside. He was then placed in a police lineup and identified by his alleged victim, who was escorted from the building beneath a blanket. Strauss-Kahn was to have been in court on Sunday but that was delayed by medical and forensic examinations. Late on Sunday, he was brought out of his Harlem cell in handcuffs to be dazzled by flashbulbs, the \"perp-walk\" familiar to high-profile suspects and loved by prosecutors and the press. After all the waiting his first appearance in court brought gasps from the audience. Having failed in his bid for temporary freedom Strauss-Kahn kept his back to the crowd. Then he was led away again, shoulders hunched, to a room at the back of the court where prison bars were clearly visible. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2011. The original said that [Melissa] Jackson waived the threat of an extra 30-days in jail before a lawyer. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
