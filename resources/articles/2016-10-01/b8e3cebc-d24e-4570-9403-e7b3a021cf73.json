The report \u2013 produced by the sector at the request of the government \u2013 found that \u201csocio-economic disadvantage has more persistent and far-reaching impact on access to and outcomes from higher education\u201d than any other single cause. But the study by Universities UK\u2019s social mobility action group offered few concrete suggestions on how to overcome the effects of disadvantage, and instead called for further data collection, analysis and sharing of best practice between institutions. Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of Universities UK who chaired the advisory group, said: \u201cThe evidence provides a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done to improve social mobility. Disadvantage is deeply entrenched in our society, and there are no quick and easy answers. \u201cUniversities are absolutely committed to promoting social mobility and are undertaking extensive and ambitious work. Our report concludes that we need to carry on doing this work, but with more evaluation, more focus on advice and guidance to students, and better collaboration with schools and employers, and with government.\u201d The report painted a stark picture of the gaps in access to higher education, with 18-year-olds from the most advantaged groups more than six times more likely to attend highly selective institutions than those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It also noted the \u201cunexplained\u201d 15 percentage point gap between the proportion of white graduates gaining a first or upper second degree and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Les Ebdon, a member of the advisory group and the government\u2019s director of fair access to higher education, said he was encouraged by the report\u2019s emphasis on the role of universities in widening access. \u201cBut there is still much work to do. Too many talented people are still missing out on the life-changing benefits of higher education,\u201d Ebdon said. Among the report\u2019s recommendations was that universities make \u201cgreater use of contextual data to inform offer making\u201d, meaning applicants\u2019 social and economic family backgrounds be used to adjust admissions offers, and to identify groups or regions that find it more difficult to gain access. Combating the effects of disadvantage and poor schooling, according to the report, \u201cmay also require wider use of contextual admissions processes in which universities identify an applicant\u2019s potential as well as their prior attainment in determining admissions\u201d. While many universities already use some forms of contextual data in admissions decisions, its widespread use has been resisted especially among selective universities. The report also concluded that \u201cthe evidence suggests there should be a particular focus on access for white working-class men\u201d, although it noted that access rates for white working-class women and those from mixed race backgrounds were little better. \u201cEnsuring sustained, targeted outreach work that starts at primary school is critical if we are to improve access for this group, along with ensuring that pupils are informed about their options and know why higher education is relevant to their future plans,\u201d the authors, which included several vice-chancellors and senior academics, concluded. Jo Johnson, the universities minister, said: \u201cWe are seeing record numbers of disadvantaged young people going to university and benefiting from the real opportunities that our world-class universities can offer. \u201cBut, as this report makes clear, there is still more to do. That is why I welcome this important piece of work from Universities UK and also why we are legislating for a new transparency duty which will place a clear requirement on all universities to release more information about their admissions process and real incentives on all institutions to go further and faster to promote social mobility.\u201d The social mobility advisory group was established last year after a request by Johnson. Earlier this year the then prime minister, David Cameron, was highly critical of university admissions policies, saying: \u201cToo many in our country are held back \u2013 often invisibly \u2013 because of their background or the colour of their skin.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
