Instead of having to book an appointment with their GP or family planning clinic and wait to be seen, they will be able to walk into the chemist's unannounced during shop opening hours and obtain the pill after a discreet conversation with the pharmacist. The Department of Health said it had not yet been decided whether girls under the age of 16 would be able to get the pill from the chemist without their parents being informed. The plans are at an early stage, a spokesperson said, and pilot schemes have yet to be set up. But the morning-after pill is already available to women including under-age girls from a pharmacist, if he or she is satisfied that they are competent to make the decision to take it and are in good health. Any woman getting the pill in this way would have to go through the same procedure as she would if she visited the GP. That would involve a questionnaire about her health and other medication she might be taking. It could also mean that the pharmacist would take her blood pressure. Pharmacists will also be given extra training. \"We will work with the pharmacy profession to ensure robust standard-setting and appropriate training to ensure pharmacists are competent to safely provide this service,\" the department said. The move towards pharmacy availability is intended to make life easier for women, said the health minister, Lord Darzi, announcing the proposals in the House of Lords. \"We recognise that pharmacies could play an increased role in the provision of contraception and other sexual health services because of their accessibility and convenient opening hours,\" he said. \"We will work with primary care trusts over the next year to pilot supply of contraception, including the contraceptive pill, through NHS arrangements.\" For the change to come about, strategic health authorities must issue instructions called patient group directions, permitting pharmacists to prescribe specific medicines to specific groups of people. Not only the morning-after pill but also cholesterol-lowering statins are already available from pharmacists, who carry out checks to ensure the drugs are suitable for those who request them. The Department of Health wants to increase the range of medicines made available this way. Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, said the move was \"extremely welcome\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
