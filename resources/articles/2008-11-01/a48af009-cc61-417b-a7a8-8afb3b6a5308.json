Mushtaq, the former Pakistan and Sussex leg-spinner, was controversially recruited by the England and Wales Cricket Board at the end of the season to fill their problematic role of spin bowling coach - with the fine tuning of Panesar regarded as his most immediate priority. But the ECB has still not secured a work permit for Mushtaq, who now cannot join Panesar as intended when the England performance squad leaves for an Indian training camp at the end of this week. Now Panesar must work under the advice of several Indian spin-bowling coaches, as yet unnamed. Many argue that he should be part of England's one-day squad. Yuvraj Singh questioned his non-selection after his whirlwind hundred in the first ODI in Rajkot on Friday. The Home Office has yet to reveal whether the delay is linked to criticism of Mushtaq's appointment by the International Cricket Council chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, because Mushtaq had been implicated and fined eight years ago in a Pakistan match-fixing enquiry. For Panesar, still one of the world's finest finger spinners but one whose development is widely agreed to have slowed, this is a second setback in little more than a fortnight. Initial plans that he should gain more experience of sub-continental pitches in Sri Lanka, with the Colombo-based side, Bloomfield, were scrapped at the last-minute after Bloomfield requested a \u00a37,000 donation towards their pavilion development. The ECB refused, offering only the original fee of \u00a3500. A switch to India under the tutelage of Mushtaq, a veteran of 52 Tests and 144 ODIs, seemed ideal, with the ECB blithely assuming that as his record-breaking years at Sussex had passed without comment, so would his appointment. But even before the ECB hit work-permit delays, the appointment had became controversial when Lorgat criticised the appointment on moral grounds. \"We are aware of the sanction and criticism of Mushtaq within the Qayyum report,\" said Lorgat. \"We will not tolerate corruption within our sport and expect the ECB to provide us with details and assurances that it will monitor Mushtaq's activities and performance during his tenure as a coach.\" The exact nature of that monitoring has yet to be agreed - England merely stating that he will come under the ICC code of conduct like any member of their managerial staff and privately they suspect Lorgat grandstanding as the ICC attempts to restate its right to run the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
