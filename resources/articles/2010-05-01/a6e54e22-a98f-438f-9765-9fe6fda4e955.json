It's a question few people ever ask themselves, but Kresse Wesling (right), an environmental expert, has a particularly enquiring mind. Her curiosity took her to Croydon, where all Greater London fire hose is taken for repair or binning. \"I thought, 'What a beautiful material,'\" she remembers. Instead of going to landfill, hose soon began arriving in Dorset, where Wesling runs Elvis and Kresse, a company specialising in liberating materials from rubbish dumps. Wesling spent months grappling with hose, scrubbing it clean (without chemicals), and learning to sew it (she went through four sewing machines). But she was determined this functional rubbish should have a glamorous end. Isabella Macpherson, co-founder of art-eco fashion brand ISSI, knew the solution. \"Artists!\" she explains, brightly. Macpherson worked with four artists to turn the redundant hose into a collection of luxury bags. The results are unexpected and beautiful: Simon Periton saw no reason not to make a winged insect, while Lothar G\u00f6tz (whose bag is pictured above, with the pair at Islington fire station) took his customary architectural approach. From tomorrow, the collection will be on sale in Selfridges. But in contrast to other It bags, 50% of Wesling and Macpherson's profits will go to the Fire Fighters Charity. \"Unlike fashion designers trained to work with a narrow range of materials, artists work with all sorts of things,\" says Macpherson. \"Working with rubbish fires their imagination.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
