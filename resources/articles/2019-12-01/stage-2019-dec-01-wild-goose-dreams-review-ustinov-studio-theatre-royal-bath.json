Guk Minsung is a \u201cgoose father\u201d, one of those whose families live abroad for the sake of the children\u2019s education; it is seven years since he has seen his US-based wife and daughter. Yoo Nanhee is a defector from North Korea, missing the father she left behind. In Michael Boyd\u2019s new production, their loneliness and isolation in a world of internet connectivity is, at first, wittily presented. Each stands separately on Jean Chan\u2019s stark, putty-coloured set, staring at a computer screen (invisible to the audience). Around them dances a bright chorus of smiley young people, voicing the babel texts of techno-communication: one-zero-one-one\u2026 Missile test in\u2026 No response\u2026 What\u2019s on your mind?\u2026 Poke here for love\u2026 Delete\u2026 Reboot. Brought together by the Love Genie dating site, the two are quirky and funny. \u201cIs it sexy to apologise during sex in North Korea?\u201d asks London Kim\u2019s anxious Guk . Chuja Seo\u2019s Yoo is too distracted to answer: her father has appeared at the rumpled bedside. This is the first of a number of visions that also include a dancing firing squad and a penguin bobbing up from a toilet bowl (an image connected to a story Yoo\u2019s father tells involving an angel and flight). South Korean US-based playwright Hansol Jung\u2019s action has imaginative flair, but I found myself longing for the dramatic equivalent of a pop-up blocker. Too many ideas jostle across fragmented scenes, leaving no space for themes to develop or gain emotional traction. A few deletes and a reboot could resolve these issues. \u2022 At the Ustinov Studio, Theatre Royal Bath; until 21 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
