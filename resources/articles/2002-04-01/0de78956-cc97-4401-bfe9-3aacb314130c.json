The defeat by Scotland in Cardiff was followed by an overwhelming rejection of a plan by the Welsh Rugby Union to reduce the number of professional clubs from nine to six. \"I am very depressed,\" said Tony Brown, whose money has reinvigorated Newport over the last three years. \"I am committed to the club for another two years but we have reached a point where you wonder if there is any point in making any new investment in the Welsh game. The plan for six clubs was a sensible one based on the financial and playing resources in Wales, but there was clearly no way a majority of the 239 clubs was going to vote in favour.\" But there was overwhelming backing at Sunday's emergency meeting of the clubs for reform of the WRU general committee, and the union plans to get the clubs together again next month to debate a working party report recommending root-and-branch change. \"That meeting is vital to the future of Welsh rugby at all levels,\" said Newport's chairman David Watkins. \"There is no doubt owners are on the point of walking away and you cannot blame them. They will be wasting their money unless there is change at the top. \"We need two different administrations, one each for the professional and amateur games. At the moment, players way down the divisions are getting paid and that is a nonsense. We are going nowhere and this is our last chance. If the top clubs do not receive proper funding, we will probably all have to become semi-professional and see our best players go to England or France.\" Newport are among six clubs - Cardiff, Llanelli, Swansea, Pontypridd and Bridgend are the others - who forced Sunday's meeting. \"The meeting came to the right decision,\" said Ray Harris, chief executive of Ebbw Vale, whose top-flight status would have been threatened by a yes vote. \"The decisive rejection was effectively a vote of no confidence in the WRU and its chairman Glanmor Griffiths should be considering his position.\" The WRU secretary Dennis Gethin said there would be no resignations but added that it was accepted that the union needed shaking up. Newcastle's rugby director Rob Andrew is maintaining his silence after being asked to apologise for remarks he made about the Gloucester hooker Olivier Azam following December's league match. Andrew claimed Azam had racially insulted Newcastle's flanker Epi Taione but an RFU inquiry cleared the hooker. Azam has said he will consider a libel action against Andrew unless he receives a public apology, but Andrew said: \"I have no comment to make at present.\" Newcastle's owner David Thompson said he will support Andrew in any court action. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
