With Crown holding casino licences in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, each of the state-based gaming authorities is likely to want to run the ruler over Lawrence Ho\u2019s acquisition and assess whether the newest significant shareholder meets requirements that casino operators are fit and proper people. Ho\u2019s company Melco may also require foreign investment approval, given the extensive commercial real estate held by Crown \u2013 particularly if it plans to buy more shares than its current 19.9% holding. Most attention will centre on what the NSW regulator \u2013 likely to be the lead agency \u2013 decides, though each state must make its own call on whether Ho and Melco are fit and proper operators. The reason NSW will take the lead is because the states\u2019s authorities included a specific clause in Crown\u2019s licence for Sydney\u2019s new Barangaroo casino \u2013 now under construction \u2013 when they granted it in 2014. It says Crown will \u201censure that it prevents any new business activities or transactions of a material nature between Stanley Huang Sun Ho or a Stanley Ho associate and Crown, any of Crown\u2019s officers, directors or employees or any Crown subsidiary\u201d. Family connections Lawrence Ho, 42, is the son of Stanley Ho, who for decades ran the gambling monopoly in Macau. Ho senior owned a number of the old-style Macau casinos which made the \u201cLas Vegas of Asia\u201d famous as place of pleasure, vice and money laundering. Though Chinese authorities ended his monopoly in 2002, SJM Holdings \u2013 the company he founded \u2013 now operates 21 casinos in Macau and several others elsewhere in Asia, including one in North Korea. Over the years his casinos have been widely believed to be linked to organised crime syndicates, specifically the 14K and Sun Yee On triad societies. The Ho family has always denied these accusations and they have never been proved. In 2010, after a long investigation, the New Jersey gaming authorities issued a report declaring a link between Stanley Ho and the triads and requiring that MGM Mirage Macau (a joint venture with Ho) divest its interest in an Atlantic City casino. The 74-page report declared that Stanley Ho Hung-sun was an associate of known and suspected triads who had permitted \u201corganised crime to operate and thrive within his casinos\u201d. It found that the private VIP gambling rooms Ho introduced to his casinos beginning in the 1980s \u201cprovided organised crime the entry into the Macau gaming market that it had previously lacked\u201d. But that was nearly 10 years ago. Stanley Ho is now 97, in frail health and his daughter Pansy \u2013 Lawrence\u2019s sister \u2013 has taken over the SJM empire. Once the tycoon dies the clause in the NSW licence may be irrelevant \u2013 and that could be any day. On the face of it, it might seem that a son would automatically qualify as an associate of his father, but the term is a legal one which requires the establishment of legal control or influence over the associate\u2019s corporate decisions. Lawrence Ho has always insisted his casino empire is entirely separate, and developed without his father\u2019s money or influence. Packer told the Australian Financial Review\u2019s Chanticleer last week that Ho has built Melco Crown \u201con his own with no link or help from Stanley\u201d. Licence conditions The NSW authorities looked into Lawrence Ho and his relationship with his father when they granted the Barangaroo licence in 2014. By that time, he and Packer were in business together in Macau. \u201cAt the time Crown received its restricted gaming licence for Crown Sydney in 2014, the NSW regulator undertook extensive probity checks and carefully considered Crown\u2019s interest in Melco Resorts,\u201d the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority said last week. Insiders said \u201cthe Stanley Ho clause\u201d had only been included \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d in case circumstances changed. But that isn\u2019t the end of the matter. There will be plenty of other avenues for the regulators to explore, notably Melco\u2019s tie-ups with junket companies that bring high-rollers to its casinos in Asia. Junket operators have relationships with all the big Macau casinos. The arrangements vary but some actually run the VIP rooms or share in the casino profits. In return they bring high-rollers known as \u201cwhales\u201d, usually from mainland China, offering them free accommodation, private jets, entertainment and bank-like services. The junkets played a crucial role in money laundering from the mainland, which in 2013 was said to have reached $US203bn a year, according to one US congressional report. Because gambling debts cannot be enforced in China, the junket trade was historically dominated by organised crime and the triads. But as the casino business has transformed so have the junket companies. Some are now listed companies run by apparently legitimate business figures. The problem is knowing who is who. Despite the changes, a 2016 paper by the sociologist Prof T Wing Lo and the criminologist Dr Sharon Kwok lent weight to the view that organised crime was still a major factor in the the junket trade. \u201cThe VIP-room operations are still dominated by triads to date,\u201d the Hong Kong academics concluded after in-depth interviews with triad members, police and casino operators. \u201cBut they have readjusted their traditional intrusive role and reinvented harmonious business strategies to suit the market reality.\u201d Junket tours According to the study, junket companies responsible for running VIP rooms in Macau \u201care the main drivers of economic profits for the triads\u201d. The researchers found that because of the casinos\u2019 dependence on gamblers from mainland China, the triads had been forced to form connections with gangsters in China to assist in ensuring that debts were paid once gamblers returned home. The Macau gaming authorities have rejected the findings of the study. There have been no findings against Melco but this is the first time Melco has invested outside of Asia and Cyprus into a jurisdiction which has extremely strict probity requirements. The eyes of gaming authorities in the US and other countries will be watching the NSW inquiry. In May last year Melco announced it would not be relying on junkets to bring gamblers to its new Morpheus tower at City of Dreams, and instead would be targeting a mass market directly. In announcing the move away from junkets, Ho told Reuters: \u201cEventually it\u2019s much better to develop your own database than rely on junkets.\u201d But casinos still use junkets to lure the VIP gamblers, who on average splurge 10 times as much. There are still many variables in the Crown-Melco deal. Ho has said he does not believe he needs approval but will seek it anyway \u2013 a signal, perhaps, that he intends to take an active role in Crown and a larger stake in the future. In a statement to the New York Stock Exchange, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment said: \u201cMelco intends to pursue board representation on Crown\u2019s board of directors commensurate with its ownership position. Additionally, subject to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals, Melco welcomes the opportunity to increase its ownership in Crown.\u201d The Australian investigations are likely to take at least a year, analysts says \u2013 though they could take even longer. An investigation by NSW authorities into the Malaysian company Genting\u2019s bid to buy 25% of Crown\u2019s rival Star took nearly three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
