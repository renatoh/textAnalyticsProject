The Aston Villa winger has, after all, played for Leeds United and Newcastle United, taking in nine managers, one relegation and enough off-the-field drama to satisfy the most outlandish of fiction writers. Among the highlights was the quote that \"you will never win anything with a team full of James Milners\". The person doing the talking was Graeme Souness, Milner's Newcastle manager at the time. It is startling to think that the player is only 23. But after the trials and tribulations Milner has found stability at Aston Villa and he can sense a defining moment on the international stage. Milner marked his 44th cap for the England Under-21s on Thursday night with a goal, an assist and a missed penalty in the 2-0 win over Spain at the European Under-21 Championship in Sweden. He described the result, which ensured England's progress to the semi-finals with one group game to spare, as \"right up there as one of the best\" of his time with the squad. But the bigger picture has not escaped him. England have not won a tournament at any level since Robbie Fowler's Under-18 team triumphed at the European Championship in 1993 and supporters have become depressingly familiar with hard-luck stories. The opportunity to effect a change to the national psyche beckons. \"You can get into a here-we-go-again mentality when England gets to a major championship and it's important that we get out of that,\" said Milner. \"We haven't performed well in the past, the seniors, sendings-off and penalties ... you do get into that trend, so it would be a massive thing if we could win this. \"You look at the Spanish team that won Euro 2008 and how many of that squad came through the Under-21s. People might think it's a different level but it's such a massive thing playing in these major youth finals and winning them. You get into that winning mentality. Players can then step up into the seniors and use that experience of winning things.\" Milner, who was with Fabio Capello's senior squad for the recent World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra, believes that the England set-up under the Italian is now more cohesive. \"It has changed a lot,\" he said. \"When I was first in the Under-21s and there was a vacancy in the full side, it was not necessarily an Under-21 player who got called up: 80% it would be someone else. But now you see Under-21 players getting their chance and that is credit to the new set-up, with Stuart Pearce working so closely to Fabio Capello.\" Milner is suspended for Monday's final group tie against Germany, in which Pearce could play some of his fringe squad members."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
