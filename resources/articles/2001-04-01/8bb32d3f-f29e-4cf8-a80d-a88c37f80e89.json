But with each book, Rebus's ghosts, and Rankin's interest in the skeletons mouldering under Edinburgh's haughty surface, have grown, till the series no longer seems about solving crimes, but investigating one man's soul and one city - even modern Scotland itself. Black &amp; Blue (1997) was the turning point, as Rankin borrowed James Ellroy's staccato style and ambition to interweave the return of Scotland's most mythic uncaptured criminal, the 1960s sex killer Bible John; corruption flowing in from the offshore oil industry to the police force of which Rebus is a compromised member; and Rebus's attempt to shake his worsening alcoholism. It moved from Edinburgh's shadowy steepness - \"a precipitous city . . . its inhabitants falling slowly, almost imperceptibly\" - to the Sullum Voe oilfield in the Hebrides (\"a sci-fi city transported to prehistory\"), and finally to the suburban home. There Bible John kept the evidence of his secret, endless killings from his wife in a rusting attic chest, like Bluebeard. It was a book with epic reach. The bodies and ghosts have piled up since - a possible Nazi war criminal, a Chechen gangster, and the hit-and-run crippling of Rebus's daughter in The Hanging Garden (1998); inherited paedophile behaviour, a returning serial killer, and Rebus's teenage hopes remembered too late in Dead Souls (1999); a literal skeleton under the Scottish parliament in Set in Darkness (2000); a chain of headless corpses stretching back perhaps to Edinburgh's sinful city fathers Burke and Hare in the new The Falls. Rebus has got older, wearier, sitting in an empty shell of a flat, with alcohol and old records his companions. He confuses \"comfort and oblivion\"; he is \"a failed human being\". \"The basic tenet of the books is, it's impossible to escape history,\" says Rankin, a wry, unassuming 40-year-old. \"Especially living in Edinburgh, and living in Scotland, you can never throw off the shackles of the past.\" John Hannah played Rebus in a TV adaptation of Black &amp; Blue , with four more films to follow this year, and the books' now automatic bestseller status here is spreading worldwide. Rankin's own history ties him not just to Edinburgh, but to the small Fife town of Cardenden, a birthplace he has Rebus share. A coal-mining town till the mines shut when Rankin was a child, and employment and hope bled from his surroundings, he escaped into his imagination - making his own comics, writing his own lyrics for favourite bands, both providing \"alternative worlds\". \"Can,\" he adds, ventriloquizing his young self, \"the world really be as grey as it looks ? Can it not be Technicolor?\" He read pulp paperbacks - Ernest Tidyman's Shaft series, The Godfather - then, at 15, started writing himself, learning from McEwan, Kerouac, and Solzhenitzyn. When not reading and writing in his bedroom, building his own secret identity, he hung around with Cardenden's bored teenage gangs, blending into his background. Many of his friends left like Rebus, by joining the army. Rankin himself went to Edinburgh University, and studied literature. His first novel, The Flood (1986), was a thinly disguised, \"literary\" look at Cardenden, but it was his father's reading of thrillers, and a working-class desire not to be a \"subsidised writer\", that turned him to crime. He made the middle-aged Rebus \"different from me in so many ways\", he thought at first. But, as he explains with brutal honesty, the character has become too close for comfort. \"I think his darkness was in me from the beginning. I'm probably closer to him now than when I started the series. There was a period of me getting to know him, and him getting to know me. He does a lot of the things I'd like to do but daren't. I keep myself in control, most of the time, and let him run. When my second son was born seriously disabled, the first thing I did was put Rebus's daughter in a wheelchair. Well, you can call that therapy. Or you can call that malevolence. I felt better when I'd got him with his kid unable to walk. I was using him like a punchbag. And I still do. \"But there's still very dark stuff in me that hasn't come out. And whether it will or not I don't know. I mean how dark do you go, how deep do you take it, without it affecting you ? There's a lot of stuff I don't want people to find out about me till after I'm dead. Things I've done, things I've thought. Things I think I'm capable of doing. He can draw things out of me as I write. A literary scholar is writing a book about Black &amp; Blue now. I'm terrified about what she may think she's found, that I didn't know was there.\" Unsurprisingly, he's planning a break from Rebus in two years' time. And he has already sketched the series' end. \"There's always the potential in Rebus for violence. It's why I often play him off against Cafferty, a criminal who's like him. Like Cain and Abel, they could annihilate each other. I think that's how things will finish.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
