Arrizabalaga\u2019s shaky form has led to Chelsea registering an interest in Burnley\u2019s Nick Pope and Lampard, who hopes Tammy Abraham will recover from an ankle injury to face Leicester next weekend, has been concerned about the \u00a372m Spaniard for a while. The 25-year-old made a costly error during Tuesday\u2019s 2-2 draw with Arsenal and will be rested against Hull, giving Caballero a rare chance to impress. Caballero is out of contract at the end of the season but the 38-year-old Argentinian will be keen to show he deserves more playing time. \u201cAll the players who play tomorrow do,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cAll the ones who don\u2019t start regularly. Those are the rules. That\u2019s where the goalkeeper is a specific position. Where it\u2019s quite well known there\u2019s a No 1 and a No 2. But my choice is to make that choice after the game.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager warned that Arrizabalaga has to improve after being asked whether he wants to strengthen in goal this month. \u201cI am not looking at it now,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI think with Kepa he knows. He\u2019ll be honest that there have been some mistakes that have cost us goals.\u201d Lampard said Abraham has not fractured his ankle but doubt remains over when Chelsea\u2019s leading goalscorer will return. \u201cWe were worried about a hairline fracture,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe still have to see how he develops. He\u2019s not fit for the weekend but whether he\u2019ll be fit for Leicester after that I\u2019m still not sure.\u201d Abraham\u2019s injury has intensified the pressure on Chelsea to improve their attacking options. Lampard has urged Michy Batshuayi to take his chance against Hull. Olivier Giroud, whose move to Internazionale is in danger of falling through, is unlikely to be on the bench against the Championship side. Chelsea want Edinson Cavani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain but the Uruguayan forward favours a permanent move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Lampard, who dismissed links with Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, admitted a deal for Cavani had been complicated by the 32-year-old\u2019s mother urging PSG to sell her son to Atl\u00e9tico."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
