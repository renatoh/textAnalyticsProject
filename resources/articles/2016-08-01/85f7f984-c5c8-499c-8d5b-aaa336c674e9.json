Despite economic growth, one in five children will live in poverty because of high fertility rates, inequality and deep-seated privation, according to the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). The first of the 17 sustainable development goals agreed last September aims to \u201cend poverty in all its forms everywhere\u201d by 2030. In absolute terms, the number of African children living in poverty is predicted to drop steeply: in 2012, 216 million children were estimated to be living below the $1.90 (\u00a31.44) a day World Bank threshold. The ODI predicts the number will fall to 148 million in 2030. However, because of other groups moving out of poverty faster, and because African women average more than four births each, their share in global poverty will double to 43%. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the number will grow,\u201d said Kevin Watkins, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThe point is that poverty is not coming down in Africa in comparison with elsewhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve had economic growth, and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically over the last 20 years, but fertility rates haven\u2019t started to shift.\u201d Fertility rates are highest in west Africa. Chad, where women have on average more than six children each, is near the top of the table. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to speak about and work on family planning in a country like Chad, because of many cultural and social problems,\u201d said Moydoty Maranga, director of the Chadian association of family wellbeing (Astbef), the main organisation working on family planning in the country. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t at all easy at the beginning \u2013 people said these were western ideas. We insisted, and little by little we recruited volunteers.\u201d Volunteers give out information and contraceptives as well as showing people films about the consequences of having big families. Since it started in 1991, Astbef has set up clinics that offer everything from HIV testing to post-abortion care and pre-marital counselling. \u201cWe\u2019ve especially got a lot of support from women. Resistance comes from men. This is a pro-birth society and a bit macho. Before, when you talked about condoms \u2013 ayayay!\u201d Maranga said, using a common Chadian expression of frustration and wordlessness. \u201cPeople would even throw stones. They thought they made you sterile, and that the lube could make you sick \u2013 all kinds of crazy ideas. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to talk to young people and women about it.\u201d His words were echoed by the ODI report. Women across the continent want to have fewer children, Watkins said, particularly Nigerian women, who have five children on average but would rather have closer to three. High child marriage rates \u2013 12% of girls in sub-Saharan Africa are married off before the age of 15 \u2013 mean a longer childbearing window. \u201cThe silence of African leaders on issues like child marriage is frankly outrageous,\u201d Watkins said, adding that the international community has also failed to put in place social protection systems. \u201cIt\u2019s out of step with all the things undertaken in the sustainable development goals.\u201d African governments in particular need to come up with strategies for fighting child poverty if they are serious about ending it within a generation, the report said. The Chadian government agreed to fund Astbef, but cut funding when it found itself in economic crisis. The main donor, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, wants it to look for other donors. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay salaries, we need money for transport, for contraceptives \u2013 we can\u2019t even get enough money for that,\u201d said Maranga. \u201cThis should be the government\u2019s job, but they\u2019re not doing it. So someone has to do it, and we are. But there\u2019s so little money.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
