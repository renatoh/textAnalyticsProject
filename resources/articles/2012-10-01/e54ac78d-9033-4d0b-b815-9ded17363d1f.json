I'm as excited as the next man when it comes to the breaking of glass ceilings, the challenging of male domination, women on the football pitch and in the boardroom and on the moon. I play poker! I'm all for sneaking into the boys' club. But there is nothing, literally nothing in the world, that I want to watch less than Lucy Liu as Doctor Watson. I'd sooner see Jeremy Clarkson play Hamlet. If my television received a live feed from a CCTV camera in an empty garage, if Channel 5 were broadcasting footage of my parents' most enthusiastic sexual encounters, I would be happier and more comfortable watching either of those things than the arrival on British TV of Elementary's \"Doctor Joan Watson\". Elementary, in which Liu's grim Doc Joan will be accompanied by Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes, starts this week on\u2026 wait, actually, I'm not going to tell you the channel. Benedict Cumberbatch was reportedly rattled by the news that his old friend Jonny is essaying the Great Detective. But Cumberbatch has been stitched up by dodgy press before, too often for me to believe he could be remotely bothered by any threat to the wondrous Sherlock \u2013 particularly not in the form of a CBS version in which Holmes is a drug addict fresh out of New York rehab, with an assistant of whom the audience will ask (explained the executive producer in an interview): \"Can they have a friendship without that turning into something sexual?\" If it weren't for the Observer's traditional delicacy, the sentence you're reading now would be nothing but a string of capitalised obscenities. Do me a favour: reread that producer's quote, then think of all your favourite swear words and imagine me shouting them. So these people are trying to turn Conan Doyle's great oeuvre into a latterday When Harry Met Sally? Really? Honestly? When Sherlock Met Joan? Perhaps we will soon be seeing Mrs Hudson's approving smile as Doctor Watson has a big fake orgasm over the curried fowl. The idea of introducing not just a mindlessly trendy piece of feminising, but a kneejerk \"Will they, won't they?\" angle, makes me want to throw their zeitgeisty Sherlock over London Bridge in a leaded sack and see if he wants to investigate that mystery. It's hard not to wonder why, if these people want to make a series about a junkie New York detective with a sexy lady cohort, they can't just make a new one. Scanning the TV schedules, it doesn't strike me as difficult to get a show about murders on air. Did they really have to sink their gnashers into the milky teat of the Holmes franchise? It's like Reggie Perrin, that weird (if probably well-meant) \"update\" that slunk on to BBC1 a few years ago. An inspired piece of commissioning would have been to order a new sitcom based on 21st-century professional and domestic alienation, then broadcast it back to back with a rerun series of the original and great Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Don't tell me that wouldn't have made for a terrific Thursday night's viewing. But no; like thirsty bacteria, episodes of Reggie Perrin sat slurping off the body of their host, parasitic rather than symbiotic. Meanwhile, Lucy Liu is worried that people will see only the gender change to her character and miss another excellent improvement to the rubbish old original story, telling the Times: \"It was a very big deal for me to play an Asian-American in Charlie's Angels; Watson's ethnicity is also a big deal\", as if someone had bet her \u00a3100 that she couldn't cause at least three Conan Doyle fans to suffer a pulmonary embolism. Personally, I'd like to press Liu's face into a bowl of cold pea soup for that statement. It's not just her failure to distinguish between creating a new character and mangling a beloved old one (Tread softly! You tread on my dreams!), but the triumphant tone over such an appalling and offensive racial change. Let me be clear: I rather like the idea of an Asian Watson, but American? God save us all. Watching the trailer, I found the only good thing about Watson's New York accent was that it seemed to be drowned out quite quickly by the sound of my own screaming. The real problem, though, is that the people involved in the series think they are doing something good for women by castrating detective fiction's greatest sidekick. And this is stupid. There is a massive logical flaw they aren't spotting \u2013 which does not bode well for an interpretation of literature's most logical mind. There are only two possibilities. One: it will make no material difference that Watson is female, the relationship between the characters will remain the same and this is just a bit of visual \"freshening up\", akin to making a version of Wind in the Willows where the mole is a giraffe. In which case, it simply reinforces the idea that women (and, indeed, \"Asian-Americans\") in film and television are cast purely for how they look. Or, the female Watson will behave differently and relate differently, in which case they will (in giving a familiar character a different personality when he changes sex) appear to be saying something about gender. But the first thing they're saying is that it's appropriate to have a woman in the junior role: the follower, the admirer, the helpmeet. Which is where women have been on screen for years already. To put it another way: if they do want to make a feminist statement, they should cast Lucy Liu as Holmes, not Watson. And if they don't, they should give the poor old doctor his balls back. www.victoriacoren.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
