The shock defeat to Sri Lanka at Headingley last Friday has put England\u2019s hopes of reaching the semi\u2011finals back in the balance, with victories in two of their final three games against Australia, India and New Zealand likely to be needed to secure their passage to the last four. The stakes for this latest encounter have been raised further by the lurking presence of the Ashes series that comes after the World Cup. So potential psychological points for the challenges ahead as well as qualification for the latter stages of this tournament will be on offer at Lord\u2019s. For Archer, the Barbados-born fast bowler who qualified to play for England in March, this will also be an opportunity to stake his own claim for an Ashes place as well as trying to add to the 15 wickets he has already taken in this World Cup. Smith would be a prize wicket to add to the collection for Archer and he will be helped by the inside knowledge he gained playing under the Australian\u2019s captaincy for Rajasthan Royals in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League. The pair are, according to Archer, friends. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to consider he thinks of me the same way as well. He\u2019s a really good guy.\u201d However, the mood changes when asked how that personal relationship will affect the dynamic between the pair when they face each other at Lord\u2019s. \u201cCricket is cricket and I guess it\u2019s time to be friends after,\u201d he said. \u201cBut until the game is over there will be nothing friendly about it.\u201d Archer also let slip that Smith had actively avoided facing his 90mph-plus bowling at net sessions during their time as teammates in India. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t bowl at him much,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the guys probably don\u2019t want to face me in the nets. They like the side-arm and the throws.\u201d Another Rajasthan player in the England all-rounder Ben Stokes also knows Smith well and Archer suggested the pair will formulate plans to get the better of the Australian, who scored a match-winning century during a pre-tournament warm-up match against England in Southampton last month. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Archer. \u201cWhen you play with them you pick up on things you won\u2019t normally notice when you\u2019re just playing against them. So hopefully me and Ben, we can get together. We probably know what to do when he\u2019s in.\u201d Smith and David Warner both received hostile receptions during that warm-up match in Southampton from English fans keen to let the pair know their thoughts on the year-long bans the pair served for ball-tampering during the Cape Town Test against South Africa last year. The atmosphere at Lord\u2019s is likely to be more civil but England\u2019s players are keen to make an impression in the first major skirmish of this Ashes summer. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty up for it,\u201d said Archer. \u201cThey\u2019re second in the table so more than likely they will go through. I think if we could beat them now, if we do have to play them after [in the World Cup] we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Archer also shrugged aside questions about the added pressure on England \u2013 the tournament hosts and No 1-ranked team \u2013following the Sri Lanka match. \u201cThe pressure has been on from the very first game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the World Cup so there are no easy teams and no easy games as we saw from the last one. \u201c It is a chance to really see where our game is, having probably the three hardest games last. If we do get through we should be OK to pretty much win everything.\u201d Justin Langer, Australia\u2019s coach, was also keen to stress England\u2019s quality in what appeared a not-very thinly veiled attempt at mind games. \u201cWe have seen how they played for four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the best team in the world. Just look at their team. Nothing has changed in a week.\u201d Whether or not Australia will have to face Jason Roy at Lord\u2019s remains to be seen. The England opener will on Monday have a further scan on the hamstring he tore nine days ago but it is understood his recovery is going well and he may yet play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
