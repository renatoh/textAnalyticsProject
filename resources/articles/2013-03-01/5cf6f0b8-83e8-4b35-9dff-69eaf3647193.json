Polished to a devastating sheen by producer Terry Date, Sempiternal screams its ambition from the rooftops, its creators' trademark blend of pounding riffs and modern pop gimmicks rendered in vivid shades. There are some exhilarating moments, not least the precise grooves and barked choruses of Empire (Let Them Sing) and Crooked Young. Frontman Oli Sykes's once-strained bellowing has improved immeasurably, as showcased on the single Shadow Moses. His lyrics remain a sticking point, however; the petulance of the otherwise invigorating Antivist is particularly cringeworthy. Elsewhere, the dubstep swagger and overwrought synths of Can You Feel My Heart, and the clumsy poetry of Hospital for Souls reveal an admirable desire to experiment, but for all its aggression and pop-culture pilfering, Sempiternal frequently feels like the work of a band satisfied to slide down the surface of heavy music rather than engage with its true heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
