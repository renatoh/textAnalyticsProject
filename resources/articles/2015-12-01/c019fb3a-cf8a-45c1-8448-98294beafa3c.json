First there is Fury, the new world heavyweight champion loudly living up to the names his father, John, gave him as both a burden and an inspiration, not to mention a gift to headline writers. But his role as the elemental Traveller supposedly indifferent to what people think of him is serially undermined by his willingness to apologise for his outrageousness \u2026 followed by another outburst. Then there is Joshua, the quiet man from Watford who is meant to be leading us into the promised land, where no such malarky will be tolerated. Neither image is complete. Both are creatures of their calling: Fury by inclination, Joshua almost by accident, a latecomer to the trade. And both throw up contradictions. Fury\u2019s recanting often arrives in the click of a tweet, where he conducts much of the dialogue with his fans and detractors, but on Friday the task was left to his trainer and uncle, Peter Fury, to issue a statement of regret on the fighter\u2019s behalf \u2013 less than a week after he had ended the 11-year reign of Wladimir Klitschko in D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cI am aware of the recent newspaper articles,\u201d it reads in the fighter\u2019s voice. \u201cI would like to put on record that I am not homophobic. I have homosexual friends and I do not judge them because of their sexuality. My comments that you may have read are from the holy scriptures, and this is what I live from. I am aware of my position as the heavyweight champion of the world and the responsibilities that this brings. I\u2019m also aware of my position as a role model and I hope to be a positive ambassador for the sport of boxing for many years to come.\u201d Yet earlier on Friday, Fury responded to a petition that had attracted more than 40,000 signatures calling for him to be excluded from the public vote for the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year, by tweeting: \u201cHopefully I don\u2019t win @BBCSPOTY as I\u2019m not the best roll model in the world for the kids, give it to someone who would appreciate it\u201d. What a conundrum he is, intelligent yet indiscrete, gentle yet threatening, boastful but humble. He wraps himself in the pleasing glow of making history as the first Gypsy to rule the most glamorous division, yet he seems at turn immune to, then injured by, criticism. He invokes the love of Jesus. He can denigrate women and homosexuals, while simultaneously speaking with heartfelt care and tenderness about his wife, Paris, who is six weeks\u2019 pregnant. He appears to be capable of as much love as malice, however mannered the latter. His latest slur was that \u201ca woman\u2019s best place is in the kitchen and on her back\u201d. This week, after an article in the Mail on Sunday detailed the prejudices he had expressed, Fury made what he calls flippant threats in a video interview against the journalist, Oliver Holt. For that, too, he is truly sorry. The British Boxing Board of Control will discuss his indiscretions on Wednesday. The nation will continue to discuss them on a daily basis. By the time you read this, of course, there might have been a few more twists and turns. While his candour is admirable, it is not entirely consistent. Then there is Joshua, whose own youthful mistakes seem at odds with the polite and calm young man we see in interviews, an understated antidote to the fury of Tyson, and who, paradoxically, insists he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cthe good guy\u201d. He reckons people want to see him \u201cbeat people up\u201d, and he is happy to oblige. Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, said: \u201cIn the ring he\u2019s vicious, ruthless. But when I talk to American TV executives about him, they are so impressed. I say to them: \u2018Five minutes with this guy, and he\u2019ll win you over.\u2019\u201d In a quiet restaurant in the City on Friday afternoon, over a selection of steak cuts that he devours efficiently, Joshua talks without edge about Fury, about his opponent in London on Saturday night, Dillian Whyte, and about himself. Should Fury temper his remarks now he is champion? \u201cYou should never change who you are,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are going to like or hate you, anyway. But, with becoming heavyweight champion of the world comes responsibility, because you\u2019ve got people from kids to grandmas watching you. Everyone\u2019s listening. There\u2019s a place and a time to say certain things, and you\u2019ve got to think before you speak.\u201d Whyte, meanwhile, appears to be another antagonist eager to drag the dialogue back to the gutter. Last week he called Joshua \u201ca scumbag\u201d. Joshua\u2019s response? He predicts a good, honest challenge from the south Londoner, who beat him in the amateurs and is undefeated as a professional. But he also expects to win quickly and is not interested in vitriolic hype. They nevertheless got warmed up in a heated head to head, which pleased the suits no end before a pay-per-view event to wrap up their 2015 season, but it left no visible scar on the favourite. All fighters say they do not think beyond their next opponent, and wise it is too. However, Joshua knows the talk of the town is Fury and that eventually they will fight. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Fury for a long time and I\u2019m entertained by it,\u201d he says, \u201cbut he won\u2019t really faze me, just because I\u2019ve heard it for so long now, the interviews, seeing what he did against Klitschko. You guys talk about mind games. I\u2019ll be conscious that it is all part of the game. I won\u2019t let it worry me. \u201cKlitschko tried to embrace it, because he\u2019s that professional. He tried to shut it down \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what rattled him. You\u2019ve got to laugh at it. If you don\u2019t laugh at it, and take it on board and think, whoa, he\u2019s funny, it\u2019s going to do the opposite. You know: \u2018What a clown, I don\u2019t want to be around the guy,\u2019 [which would] have some sort of negative effect. I\u2019d rather enjoy the couple of weeks with Fury [before they fought].\u201d As to how he would handle him in the ring, he has a simple plan. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to double up your jab. When you\u2019ve got a man with a longer jab, you can\u2019t throw single shots. You\u2019ve got to go bang, bang, really come in behind it. You\u2019ve got to be switched on in the sense of instincts. So when someone jabs, you can\u2019t just wait; you\u2019ve got to be boxing, boxing, come back, bang, hit \u2019em with some left hooks \u2013 when you\u2019re on the inside. \u201cThat\u2019s the key with someone tall; you\u2019ve got to work \u2019em on the inside, because, on the outside, you could be struggling to out-box them. Klitschko was either waiting for a single shot, or trying to out-jab him. He should have doubled it up and then stepped into range.\u201d For now it is Whyte, though, and he has been doing a mini-Fury, trying to get inside Joshua\u2019s head. He stopped Joshua in the amateurs. He is unbeaten and he says he\u2019ll do it again.\u201cHe believes it,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got a chance, haven\u2019t they. Because we\u2019re all big, every heavyweight has knockouts on their record, no matter how talented they are. And a lot of champions, some unbelievable fighters, were dropped at some stage. \u201cSo then I realised it\u2019s not about that; it\u2019s more about your heart, if you want to get up and continue to fight. Some people get knocked down, they\u2019re half conscious but they just haven\u2019t got it in them to get up. At heavyweight, if anyone gets caught flush or you don\u2019t see the punch, you probably get dropped. It\u2019s where your heart is and if you\u2019ve got that will to get up.\u201d Did he have that sort of heart? \u201cOh yeah, man. When I sleep at night, I sleep good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
