The protest, organised by Chinese artists and British supporters, has been prompted by the detention of Ai Weiwei, the artist and designer whose installation of millions of ceramic sunflower seeds currently fills the floor of the gallery's Turbine Hall. Onlookers sunning themselves by the river were invited to read out the names in a protest called Nian Nian Bu Wang (\"Read, Read, Don't Forget\") \u2013 a title borrowed from the event the Chinese artist held last year when he asked 5,000 internet users around the world to help him commemorate the schoolchildren killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. \"There is a movement across the world this spring, whether it is in China or the Middle East, which is about speaking truth to power, and I think Ai Weiwei has become a symbol of that. It is great that people have come here to join in,\" said the maverick British artist known as \"Bob and Roberta Smith\". Alongside the group of activists, a man-sized fluffy white rabbit, representing the Chinese state in this year of the rabbit, posed with tourists, carrying a banner that read \"Ai Weiwei is an artist not a criminal\". Earlier in the day, protesters climbed into Ai's sunflower seed exhibit and handed out names of missing or detained dissidents. The words \"Release Ai Weiwei\" appeared across the side of the lightbox on top of the gallery on the banks of the Thames. In the United States the diplomatic pressure backing calls for Ai's release is growing. A state department spokesman told the Observer that the issue had been raised in China by Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary, during his meetings in Beijing. \"We continue to follow closely the situations of Ai Weiwei and others who peacefully expressed their political views and we urge the Chines government to respect the human rights of all Chinese citizens,\" he said. On Friday, the UN's working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances issued a statement emphasising the illegality of \"disappearances\" under international law. \"There can never be an excuse to 'disappear' people, especially when those persons are peacefully expressing their dissent with the government of their country,\" it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
