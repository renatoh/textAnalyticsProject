That I'm sure is what this Tory-led government is hoping. Why freeze the budget for six years? Why not one year and then review it? Or is it that six years of being squeezed is the predicted time it will take before the BBC falls to its knees and can then be easily taken apart by this vicious pack of wolves. The BBC costs each of us just under 40p a day. That's 40p for a massive range of services \u2013 TV, local news, news online, radio and so much more \u2013 services that the commercial sector can only dream of. Michael Burgess Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 The Murdoch payback begins ... Bob Nicholson Frodsham, Cheshire \u2022 It is extremely disappointing to find you devoting virtually the whole of a page to the unfortunate cat-in-the-bin lady (A modest fine, but no end to the outrage, 20 October). What she did was sad and cruel, but she has paid for it many times over. No doubt much sadder and crueller things were done in this country \u2013 unpublicised and unpunished \u2013 on the day in question. Christopher Scarles Eastbourne, East Sussex \u2022 What a relief to see a grown-up Wayne Rooney finally separating himself from this unbearable Uebervater Alex Ferguson (Comment, 20 October). Ferguson's attitude of disappointed boys-school headmaster, pumping guilt into his pupil's conscience, has taken quite an impact, but I still hope Rooney has the strength and courage to withstand Ferguson's hysterical performance. Norbert Andersch London \u2022 I recently attended the urology clinic at Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton (Letters, 20 October). The consultant was very efficient, but I was somewhat alarmed to learn that his name was Mr Burns-Cox. W Rosser Wellington, Somerset \u2022 I note that in your report \"Half a sausage a day\" (19 October) the spokesman for the meat producers is Mr Lamb.
