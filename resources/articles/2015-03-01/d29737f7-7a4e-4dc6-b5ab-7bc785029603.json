Harry Kirkham, 16, was struck by the patrol vehicle as he was crossing Sutton New Road after leaving church with his friends. In a statement, West Midlands police said the officer driving the car is not believed to have been on an emergency call at the time of the accident, which happened just after 9pm on Wednesday. The officer, who is based in Sutton Coldfield, provided first aid at the scene before paramedics arrived. The boy reportedly suffered a cardiac arrest and was rushed to the city\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he died. Police said the officer was traumatised by the incident but was assisting the investigation and had been questioned by members of his force\u2019s professional standards department. In a post on the force\u2019s Facebook page, Ch Insp Neil Hobson said: \u201cNo parent should have to lose a child, particularly in such tragic circumstances. This evening our thoughts are with Harry\u2019s family following their tragic loss. As Harry was hit by a police car, West Midlands police has informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission, who continue to be updated.\u201d The 16-year-old, from the city\u2019s Kingstanding area, had attended a weekly church service at the Potter\u2019s House Christian Fellowship Church, according to the Birmingham Mail. Pastor Lewis Claxton, from the Potter\u2019s House Church, told the paper that he had run to the scene after hearing the crash. \u201cI was standing at the door of the church when I heard what seemed to sound like a car crash or a collision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a police car in the road, and we ran over to the young man, where he was put in the recovery position by the other man from the church. I went over to his younger brother, who was very upset. We\u2019d had a service at 7.30pm and the brothers had attended for the last three weeks. We had just begun to get to know them. It was very traumatic.\u201d Police said they had spoken to witnesses and that investigators were reviewing CCTV footage, which may have captured the moment the teenager was struck by the Peugeot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
