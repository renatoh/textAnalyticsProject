Forty-eight hours after England reacted to his scintillating form by calling the uncapped 25-year-old into their one-day squad to face India, he struck a 90-ball 104, his fifth hundred in 12 innings across all formats. Unfortunately for the Outlaws, international commitments mean Hales is unavailable for their last-eight tie at Trent Bridge, provisionally scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cI gave myself the chance to get in on what was a good batting track and, once in, I knew I could take the game away,\u201d said Hales, who has shed the Twenty20-specialist tag this year through weight of runs in the County Championship. \u201cI have worked hard on my technique behind the scenes, leaving the ball better and playing straighter and it\u2019s pleasing that it appears to be working. \u201cWith the two new white balls there will always be a little bit of movement early doors and for the first 20-30 balls of an innings you have to approach it as if you are opening in a first-class game. The white ball stops moving at around that stage and then you can really accelerate.\u201d Hales played circumspectly while his opening partner, Michael Lumb, blazed 36 in a stand of 46 and did not fully open his shoulders until the 13th over when he dexterously dealt with a beamer from Richard Jones with the potential to put him out of the India series. The over cost 16 runs and was the catalyst in a stand of 138 with the Nottinghamshire captain, James Taylor. When Hales plonked his third six on to the upper deck of the Radcliffe Road stand to reach three figures it appeared the hosts would win at a canter. But he paid for giving himself room outside leg stump moments later when a delivery from Recordo Gordon ricocheted off his pads into the stumps. Yet the regular fall of wickets, coupled with the threat of Somerset defeating Surrey at the Kia Oval, jeopardised Notts\u2019 future in the competition. Floodlight failure in Kennington played its part in the drama \u2013 reducing Somerset\u2019s victory target to 275 in 46 overs from 285 in 50 \u2013 and it appeared to be lights out for the home side when Gordon bowled Ajmal Shahzad with 19 required from the final 10 deliveries. Instead of being reduced to 284-9, however, Notts were given a two-run boost and a free hit when TV replays showed the Warwickshire pace bowler had over-stepped. Shahzad, one of the feistiest competitors on the county scene, then swung another chest-high no-ball for six to further intoxicate a 5,000 crowd. Cue one last twist as Shahzad was run out at the non-striker\u2019s end in the final over. It left three required from four deliveries with the No11, Harry Gurney, at the crease. With a tie sufficient for Notts, Gurney squeezed a single to draw the scores level and Luke Fletcher drove the final ball handsomely down the ground for four to secure the win. Warwickshire relinquished home quarter-final status as a result after displaying great resolve throughout the contest and Jonathan Trott\u2019s second hundred of the competition typified their efforts. Addressing the loss of two early wickets, the 33-year-old survived a confident caught behind appeal from Ajmal Shahzad in the 20s and was also floored on 36 by Samit Patel low down at short midwicket off left-armer James Franklin. In tandem with another former England Test player Tim Ambrose, Trott shared a 185-run stand for the third wicket. Both were victims of Fletcher\u2019s impressive death bowling, which helped reap career-best figures of 4-44, and Ambrose was denied a century of his own after being yorked by a slower ball and Trott held on the short boundary at midwicket from a tired haul to leg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
