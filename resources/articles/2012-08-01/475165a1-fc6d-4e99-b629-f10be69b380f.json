Now, there's just the creeping sense of inevitability; a deep sigh and a \"not again\". Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Oak Creek: it's hard to keep up with the roll-call of American place names now synonymous with massacre. Monday afternoon, it happened in College Station, a city of about 230,000, a couple of hours east of Austin, the Texas capital. So far, police have confirmed that three people have died, including an officer and the gunman, near the A&amp;M University campus, and that six other people have been taken to hospital. As the details of what happened become clearer, there'll be the obligatory discussion in the media, on social networks, and in bars, about whether guns are to blame. In my view, there is no debate: of course, they are. Last month, when a man killed 12 people in a mass shooting during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises at a Colorado cinema, I posted a link on Facebook to Gary Younge's Comment is free piece, which argued that America needed to talk about gun control in the wake of the shooting. \"In the aftermath,\" I wrote above the link, \"there absolutely is a moral dilemma.\" I was surprised when one of my more liberal American friends accused me of \"jumping on the politicising-the-tragedy bandwagon\", as I don't think it's party-political at all. In fact, for me, his response reminded me how many friends of mine who vote Democrat staunchly defend the second amendment of the US constitution. It cuts across party lines. It is, after all, inspired verse from the Founding Fathers. And their word is gospel. The fact Monday's shooting happened in Texas came as no surprise, either. We seem to have our fair share of gun rampages. My hometown of Austin boasts the first modern-day school shooting: in 1966, Charles Whitman, a student at the University of Texas, climbed the university tower \u2013 a 27-storey structure that is an iconic landmark on the city's skyline \u2013 and picked off people at random with a shotgun. By the time Whitman was felled by a police officer's bullet, his gruesome tally had reached 15, including his wife and his mother, whom he had murdered earlier in the day. Ironically, what became known as the Luby's Massacre \u2013 a 1991 slaughter at a cafeteria an hour north of Austin \u2013 just agitated for the right to bear arms. Twenty-three people died after George Hennard drove his truck into a wall, climbed out and opened fire. Suzanna Hupp, a diner, had left her handgun in her car \u2013 in order to comply with the Texas law at the time \u2013 and saw her mother and father die at Hennard's hands. Hupp later became a Republican member of the House of Representatives and a leading campaigner for the right to carry a concealed firearm in Texas \u2013 a law she saw passed here by President George W Bush. If she had been allowed to carry one that day, she offered, she could have stopped Hennard in his tracks. In the wake of Monday's shootings, Governor Rick Perry echoed this Texas orthodoxy: \"When it gets back to this issue of taking guns away from law abiding citizens and somehow know that's going to make our country safer, it's just I don't agree with that.\" Texas has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. No state license is required to own a rifle, shotgun or handgun. There's no waiting period to buy one, no state registration of weapons. And the legal age to own a gun here? Eighteen. Texas also complies with a federal law that allows Americans to own so-called assault weapons \u2013 like the AR15 semi-automatic rifle, a lethal-looking piece of military hardware. Just six days after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, my daily \"Google Offers\" email was trying to push a 10-hour concealed handgun license course on me, \"plus 20% off all personal classes\". The thinking here, presumably, is that if I got my concealed-carry licence, I'd be able to put a stop to massacres like the one in Aurora; the one at Luby's; University of Texas; or Virginia Tech. Back in April, seven students were killed at a small religious college in Oakland, California. That happened to coincide with a protest organised by Students for Concealed Carry calling attention to the fact that students are left helpless against people who choose to shoot up campuses. So, 80% of Americans own guns, but that's not enough. We need more guns in circulation to stop mass shootings, not less. That's how the argument goes. My friend Lance, a photographer working here in Austin, was a student at Texas A&amp;M University in the mid 1990s, the campus near where today's shooting happened. He grew up in Texas and owns a few guns for hunting, but he says he and his parents stopped supporting the National Rifle Association when the organisation began fighting for the right to own assault-style weapons, as well. \"I'm pro the second amendment up to a point,\" Lance says, \"but only for weapons meant to kill food.\" I push him on the issue: what about hand guns? \"It's an interesting one,\" he says. \"I have no interest in owning a handgun, but then you get into self-defense. And they do have some use as far as self-defense goes.\" According to Lance, the reality is that if the US outlawed guns (which, he points out, would never happen), it wouldn't alter the monumental number of guns already in circulation. And if there was an amnesty, it would be law-abiding citizens who would give up their guns, not criminals. \"Can't we start with the easy stuff?\" he says. \"Let's all agree assault weapons are ridiculous.\" It's a good point. Neither Democrats nor Republicans \u2013 and certainly not Libertarians \u2013 are ready to amend their precious second amendment. But surely, level-headed people would see an assault weapons ban as healthy. \"We need to elevate the discussion,\" Lance tells me. \"America needs to at least wake up and have real conversations about the issue. But it's hard because we're still so damn divided.\" Unfortunately, incidents like the one near the A&amp;M campus on Monday are just going to make that chasm even wider. And the really awful thing is, it won't be long before sketchy details of another mass-killing somewhere in the US filter into that Twitter feed again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
