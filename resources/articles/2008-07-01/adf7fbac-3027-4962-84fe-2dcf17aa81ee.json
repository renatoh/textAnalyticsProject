Five members of his squad were last night suspended by the Rugby Football League's disciplinary committee. Tony Clubb, David Howell, Louis McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Michael Worrincy and Rikki Sheriffe were all given bans following the controversial 32-26 defeat at Catalans Dragons on Sunday. McCarthy-Scarsbrook, who was sent off for his part in a late fight between the teams, has been given a three-match ban. Howell, Worrincy and Sheriffe were all banned for one game after being found guilty of punching, while Clubb was given a one-match suspension for a careless high tackle in a separate incident. McDermott's squad has already been stretched to its limits in recent weeks thanks to injury problems and he could now be forced to call on several members of the club's reserve team. The Catalans have also lost the centre or stand-off Adam Mogg for their crucial meeting with Leeds on Saturday after he was suspended for one match for his part in the brawl. Casey McGuire, found guilty of punching, escaped with a \u00a3300 fine. Daniel Anderson, the St Helens coach, believes it would be a gamble if Wigan were to give the Australian half-back Tim Smith a debut in Friday night's derby. The Wigan chairman, Ian Lenagan, yesterday hinted that Smith would be thrown straight in at the JJB Stadium despite not having played for more than three months. \"If he plays, good luck to him - he's a talented player, I've seen him in the NRL,\" Anderson said. \"But it's a gamble putting him into a derby match.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
