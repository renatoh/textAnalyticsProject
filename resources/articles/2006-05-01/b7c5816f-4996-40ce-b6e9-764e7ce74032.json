Now, at last, we have 'the Movie', the first time Tom Hanks has worked with director Ron Howard since he played astronaut Jim Lovell in Apollo 13. No doubt they thought of giving this film the subtitle 'Jesus, We Have a Problem'. Brown's novel is called a 'page-turner', partly because no one capable of reading without moving their lips would wish to linger over his prose and, although the faithful script is the work of Akiva Goldsman, who is, presumably, Jewish and, thus, a usefully disinterested party in this intramural Christian affair, Brown is on board as co-executive producer. He's also written some of the music and is awarded a special credit at the end - 'Additional Codes by Dan Brown'. The movie begins briskly by cross-cutting between a patronisingly simplistic lecture on iconology being given in Paris by Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks looking like Richard E Grant on a bad-hair day) and some dirty work at the Louvre. We've seen the antagonists of Godard's Bande \u00e0 part run through the Louvre in four minutes, a half-blind Juliette Binoche being taken there on a secret, nocturnal visit in Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, and Paul Newman standing riveted in front of G\u00e9ricault's Raft of the Medusa. But nothing has prepared us for the museum's ageing curator, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), being murdered there after hours by an albino monk, Silas (Paul Bettany). Before he dies, Sauniere provides a series of clues, mostly written in his own blood, involving the pentagram, Leonardo's Mona Lisa and Vitruvian Man and so on. To the crime scene, Captain Fache (Jean Reno) brings Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). Langdon is there because he knew Sauniere, is professor of religious symbology (a branch of codology) at Harvard and, it transpires, is being framed for the killing. Sophie is a police cryptographer, the granddaughter of Sauniere, and is also being set up for this and subsequent crimes. After working out the clues with the speed of a stockbroker doing the Telegraph crossword on the 8.15 from Tunbridge Wells, they go on the run together. Over the next two days, they brief each other on matters of cryptology, the Holy Grail, the birth of Christianity, Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, while escaping from the British and French cops and various would-be assassins with the ease and ingenuity of Harry Houdini. The cryptographers are constantly creeping into crypts, talking crap and copping out as clues lead to bizarre discoveries and encounters in churches in France, Scotland and England, including Westminster Abbey. The Da Vinci Code is essentially a familiar sort of conspiracy movie that assumes that nothing in this world or in history is as it seems. For two millenniums, sinister and benign forces have been at work to protect and deceive. In this case, we are invited to believe that a patriarchal Catholic church has been preserving the idea that Christ was wholly divine, while a secret society of good men (Isaac Newton, Leonardo Da Vinci and the Louvre's Jacques Sauniere among them) have been protecting the descendants of a human Christ and his bride, Mary Magdalene, embodiment of the eternal feminine. The film brings in elements of two popular conspiracy series: the Indiana Jones yarns (Langdon is another handsome, two-fisted, adventurous, questing academic) and the Harry Potter fantasies (Sophie, like Harry, is an anointed one and, as here, cowled assassins are on the loose around Hogwarts). But there are also traces of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. The movie's chief killer, Silas, not only delivers his mobile phone reports to his employer, the Spanish bishop, Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), in Latin, but he also practises the corporal mortification Opus Dei insists on by flagellating himself in a manner that would win Gibson's enthusiastic approval and wearing a tight garter of nails, a form of self-punishment known as a cilice. Not all Opus Dei members submit themselves to such masochistic torture, the suave bishop explains, and one supposes that for Ruth Kelly offering herself up to a daily flaying by the press is mortification enough. The Da Vinci Code is a gloomy, murky, solemn picture. The stylised, monochrome flashbacks to the Emperor Constantine's Rome, the Crusades and the Inquisition look like the work of film school students, and their ineptness serves to raise doubts about their authenticity. In one particularly embarrassing scene, ghosts from the 18th century process into the present-day Westminster Abbey to attend Newton's funeral. The movie takes its historical codswallop extremely seriously and becomes deeply sentimental, even religiose in the final reel when it appears to want to have its cake (or its bread and wine) and eat it. Hanks seems constantly perturbed, behaving as if Forrest Gump had been cast as Sherlock Holmes, and the toothsome Tautou is more maudlin than Magdalene, her thick accent often rendering her expository contributions difficult to follow. However, Ian McKellen, as the camp, conspiratorial Grail expert, the super-rich Old Etonian Sir Leigh Teabing, injects some life into the affair through the simple glee he brings to a role that's a cross between a megalomaniac Bond villain and a prim Anthony Blunt. He handles with some skill the didactic scene in which he explains to Tautou and the audience the arcane symbolism of Da Vinci's The Last Supper, which lies at the centre of the book's drama and theology. The one truly funny line, however, is spoken by Hanks and, presumably, it is intended to underpin his intellectual credentials. As he and Tautou are being chased through the streets of London, he is suddenly struck by a major thought: 'I've got to get to a library fast,' he says. I don't think anyone is likely to have their faith shaken or renewed by The Da Vinci Code, though, if you're looking for a truly distinguished thriller that debunks the history of conspiracy theories, get hold of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum. Anyone worried or puzzled about the theological issues raised by Dan Brown could do worse than read Bart D Ehrman's Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code (OUP, \u00a36.95), a lucid, unaggressive book by the chairman of the department of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, who actually enjoyed the novel. He doesn't come to the defence of Opus Dei, but it couldn't buy publicity like the book and film have provided. It has been given unprecedented opportunities to present its case, and very likely shops in Soho and elsewhere specialising in correctional equipment are seeking Opus Dei's imprimatur. How Columbia Pictures intends to deal with the protests from the National Organisation for Albinism and Hypo-pigmentation over the depiction of Silas, the albino assassin, I don't know. Some years ago, the late Art Buchwald suggested that the reason there were so many psychopathic villains in the movies was that psychopaths have no professional organisation to protect their interests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
