(The traditional remedy for indigestion, a glass of milk, will prompt your shocked stomach to generate even more acid.) And if heavy, late-night dining tends to give you uncomfortable acid reflux at night, try not to drink too much fluid while you're eating because very liquid stomach contents are easily regurgitated. Party, party! Not only can drinking alcohol on an empty stomach cause your energy levels to crash, but your appetite to shift into overdrive, with potentially disastrous consequences for your weight (and, to add insult to injury, alcohol is high in calories). To keep the alcohol in your stomach for longer, thereby dulling its appetite-sharpening effects, try to get into the habit of eating something - ideally a couple of pieces of fruit, a wholemeal-type flapjack or a sandwich made with wholemeal bread - before hitting the town. Hangovers occur for two reasons: a low blood-sugar level and dehydration. To counter the former, try to eat something (perhaps some wholegrain toast or cereal or, if you're up to it, a high-protein breakfast of grilled bacon and eggs). To ward off dehydration, either intersperse the booze with lots of water or down a couple of large glasses before falling into bed. If a hangover still strikes, rehydrate your body by drinking plenty of water, fresh fruit juice or herbal or weak tea. Avoid strong coffee because caffeine will dehydrate you even further. Gas alert Did you know that the average person generates one to three pints of gas each day? This occurs either through swallowing air while eating or drinking, increased intestinal activity or excessive bacterial fermentation of food. The worst gas-generators are vegetables like beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, corn, cucumber, leeks, lentils, onions, peppers and peas, with fruits and juices like apples, melons and raisins coming a close second. An effective way of quelling gas is to have a small pot of live yoghurt containing acidophilus or bifidus every day, which will encourage a colony of 'good' bacteria to thrive in your gut at the expense of 'bad', gas-producing bacteria. If you're allergic to, or intolerant of milk products, buy some acidophilus capsules from a health-food store instead. Top ten tips to beat tiredness 1. Drinking 2.5 litres of water a day will energise you by hydrating your body. If cold water doesn't appeal, have a hot drink, but no caffeine. 2. If you're perpetually tired, try jumping off the roller-coaster ride that is part and parcel of a caffeine habit. 3. Avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach because this will send your energy levels plummeting. 4. Eating very sweet foods on an empty stomach can energise you, but only for a minute or so, after which your blood-sugar level will drop dramatically. By contrast, because fibre helps to cushion blood-sugar swings, it provides a source of sustainable energy. Eat sweet foods either when your stomach contains some fibre or when their sugar is already combined with fibre (a cake made with wholemeal flour or oats). 5. Boost your intake of fruits and let their energy-giving fructose reinvigorate you. Freshly squeezed fruit juices or smoothies similarly provide an energising pitstop, but ensure that they don't contain too much sugar. 6. Don't overload your system by eating too much at once, which forces your body to divert a lot of oxygen to the digestive system and causes you to feel sleepy. 7. Eat more protein-rich foods, such as lean meat, chicken and fish. 8. Ask your doctor to check that you're not suffering from iron-deficiency anaemia and ensure a good iron intake by eating plenty of lean, red meat, offal, Savoy cabbage, kale, spinach, eggs. 9. Eating fewer starchy foods can give you more energy, but rather than cutting out carbohydrates completely, experiment with quantities. 10. If you're a smoker, cut down. Energy levels are directly related to the amount of oxygen circulating within the body, which is reduced by smoking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
