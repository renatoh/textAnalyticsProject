The Liverpool Wavertree MP told the Liverpool Echo that she was seriously considering a run at the job of metro mayor, which will carry a package of new powers over housing, education and planning, once a devolution deal struck as part of George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project comes into force. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been flattered by people across the Liverpool city region approaching me in recent days, encouraging me to put my name forward as a candidate for the new position of metro mayor. \u201cThis role \u2013 covering a new area including Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, as well as the city of Liverpool \u2013 is vitally important for the future success of the region. \u201cI will be consulting with family, friends and members of my constituency Labour party in the coming days, before reaching a decision on whether to put my hat in the ring.\u201d Liverpool Walton Labour MP Steve Rotheram is also said to be thinking about putting himself forward. Whoever is chosen as Labour\u2019s candidate would be expected to have a good chance of winning in the city, where the party polls strongly. If Berger were to quit Westminster to take up the new role, she would follow Sadiq Khan, who has stepped down from his Tooting seat after winning the London mayoralty. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary and former health secretary, has said he is thinking about running for mayor of Greater Manchester, which has also received its own new powers under a deal nicknamed \u201cdevo Manc\u201d. The new metro mayors, which are a key part of Osborne\u2019s plans to devolve power away from central government, are expected to be high-profile figures on the national stage. But as Berger adds her name to the list of those considering one of these new roles, it will add to fears that the Labour party in Westminster could suffer a braindrain as ambitious politicians anxious about the party\u2019s ability to win back power in 2020 look for fresh challenges elsewhere. Berger has campaigned for better treatment for sufferers of mental health problems, particularly children, since joining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. She has also spoken out about the online abuse she has received as a Jewish Labour member \u2013 and backed Corbyn\u2019s decision to appoint Shami Chakrabarti to carry out a review of antisemitism in the party. Elections for the new Liverpool metro mayor are due to be held next May. Joe Anderson, the city\u2019s current mayor, who was elected in 2012, and has been involved in negotiating the devolution deal to bring new powers to the city, is also expected to seek to be the Labour candidate. Nominations close later this month, and local party members will vote on who the candidate should be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
