The video is not great quality (grabbed on a mobile?) but it seems to me he comes across very well, rather than being a \"tough interview\" or whatever. Meanwhile a video of the original Mark Zuckerberg/ Sarah Lacy Interview From SXSW has been posted on various sites, including AllFacebook, the unofficial Facebook blog, and TechCrunch. Jemima Kiss has already provided text coverage on our PDA blog in @SXSW: Zuckerberg looking at China and stopping spam. Comment has continued in the blogosphere. Michael Arrington at TechCrunch thinks the reaction was over the top, in The \"Nuclear Disaster\" At SXSW Was Nothing More Than A Witch Burning. (A vote on the page is in his support.) Brian Solis also has a long and thoughtful post, Sarah Lacy on Sarah Lacy and the SXSW Mark Zuckerberg Keynote. Robert Scoble asks a good question about his data scraping in the first video, and has posted Audience of Twittering Assholes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
