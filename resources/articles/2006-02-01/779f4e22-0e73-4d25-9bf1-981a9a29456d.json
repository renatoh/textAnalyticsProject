If there was, and established horror brands are a reasonable commercial bet, then this satisfies that need in a workmanlike, completely flat and boring way. The film is about a smug coastal resort which has manufactured a kitschy local history of four pioneer founding fathers. But the town's wealth is based on something far more sinister, and the past comes back in the form of a fog to terrify the inhabitants, but not us particularly. If you are a fan of the original film, this remake might interest you. It's not badly made. But why was it made at all?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
