Not in Glasgow. When the wolves hit the stage at the Tramway, a good show becomes its glorious best. The National Theatre of Scotland and Improbable have collaborated in this adaptation of the scary children's book by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. The Wolves in the Walls is ingeniously billed as 'a musical pandemonium' - a description that carefully avoids the cultural weight of 'opera' and takes the mumsy merriment out of 'musical' - suitable for all those 'over seven who aren't easily scared'. It's the first time Gaiman's work has been seen in the theatre, though he's written screenplays (Beowulf is being filmed by Robert Zemeckis, Mirrormask was directed by McKean) as well as adult fantasy novels and the Sandman comic-book series. It's unlikely to be the last: this mixture of the unsettling and the shrewd makes CS Lewis look like Davina McCall: it can only be months before someone stages the amazing Coraline, in which a little girl (most of Gaiman's heroes are heroines - yeah!) discovers an alternative life in which she has an 'other mother', with buttons for eyes, and a house that becomes a photograph of itself. It's a brilliant nightmare, because so much of it is nearly normal. The Wolves in the Walls - simply written and thoroughly creepy - is fired by Gaiman's obsession with parents who get sealed off from their children, and his fascination with secret lives. A small girl hears gnawings inside her house, and knows that wolves are in the walls. Her family don't believe her, until the lupine invaders take over: the humans scarper, but our heroine ingeniously suggests that they could live in the interstices of their own home - until they, too, are ready to come out of the walls. You could find here a story about the free-wheeling life of the unconscious, parental obtuseness, child bravery, panic about immigration. The only certain thing is that the story is always shifting: there's no dead space; those walls are heaving. Julian Crouch, one of the designer-directors of Improbable, is the man to animate those shifts. He's had a hand in the most imaginative theatre of the last decade: the grisly, gaudy toy-theatre of Shockheaded Peter and Sticky's 100-foot-high sellotape monster; he raised hell when he designed Jerry Springer - the Opera. He can tweak a creature from a crumpled newspaper and turn a jumble of tape into a giant spider. He doesn't make settings for dramas: his shape-changing designs are part of the action. For The Wolves in the Walls, Crouch echoes McKean's disturbing tangle of line-drawings, sculptural paintings and photographs but also makes something entirely his own. The wolves appear first as scratchy drawings on the curtain, then torch-light eyes glow like port-holes through the fabric. You glimpse them as spiky shadow puppets, and in full-blown burlap glory as enormous, part-human, part-puppet creatures. Sometimes an actor wears a sacking beast draped like a stole: its ping-pong-ball eyes glare above swivelling jaws, while long limbs dangle to the ground like strings of sausages. Sometimes a wolf-head perches on a fully human body: one wolf-dude saunters around in jeans, hand on hip as he hoovers to the sound of jazz. A wolf-fest rampage - one on a scooter dressed as Little Red Riding Hood, another savaging a standard lamp, a third swallowed up by a tuba - and one tugging a fluffy pet on wheels, which gets mangled and spat out by the fangs of his mates - is alone worth the price of a ticket. There are plenty of other visual treats: a house is scribbled on the curtain with a beam of light; a father's dream of tuba-playing glory is greeted by ghostly clapping hands; a boy's video game floods the stage with castles and crags. And an extraordinarily beguiling pig puppet floats like a podgy pink cherub above the wolves' snapping jaws. Crouch's co-director is Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland, who has pinpoint precision and an unusual panoramic focus. That shows, though some of the considerable talents she's brought in aren't yet at full strength. Steve Hoggett provides choreography that makes the action dance - everyone leaps, glides, sashays or elevates - but it sometimes looks too energetically arty. Nick Powell's songs - for which Gaiman has supplied some new words - are too bland: where's the really frightening number? The opening scenes of the show are goody-goody: mum dances around while making jam (waving spoons and beaming) as if in a Fifties' children's telly show. But it will grow. Powell's composition is not just songs: it's a soundscape - with lusty riffs for Iain Johnstone's impressive tuba-playing father and a compelling steely guitar tune for the computer-game-playing son (Ryan Fletcher gives an electric performance as he skids around the stage propelled by the stuff coming out of his earphones) - of bleeps and pings and electronic buzzings. He's composed a silvery sequence for the preserve-making mother which she tinkles out on the jars she is filling: jamelan. The show now goes on tour, to London and through Scotland. It will end up at the Ayr Gaiety, the theatre Crouch says inspired him as a young boy. Let's hope some young Crouches are in the audience: they could be carving out the theatre of the next 20 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
