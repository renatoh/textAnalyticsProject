The 21-year-old completed his first 90-minute appearance of the year in last week's Merseyside derby defeat at Liverpool, having undergone an extensive rehabilitation programme designed to end his injury problems, but missed the FA Cup quarter-final draw with Sunderland after suffering a slight recurrence. Rodwell, along with Darron Gibson and Seamus Coleman, is also likely to miss Arsenal's visit to Goodison Park on Wednesday. Rodwell featured in Fabio Capello's final two games in charge of England and harbours hopes of being included for Euro 2012, although he was forced to miss the recent friendly against Holland due to hamstring trouble. Everton's assistant manager, Steve Round, confirmed: \"It is a slight concern. We think it is something to do with the nervous system and are exploring that avenue. The injuries he is sustaining are not always in the same spot. At a push, he could be involved against Arsenal but we owe it to him to make sure that we are doing the right thing. Maybe just giving him an extra week at this stage is the smart thing to do. It may be that a summer's rest or an injection into a nerve helps to get the inflammation down. \"He seems quite strong mentally and he will overcome this. Once he gets into the team and gets a run, he will improve. Jack is at the stage where he needs to be a regular. This has set him back a little bit but I have got every confidence that he is going to be a top player for Everton and England.\" Everton, meanwhile, are offering free coach travel to next Tuesday's FA Cup replay at Sunderland. The chief executive, Robert Elstone, explained: \"We want as many Evertonians as possible in the Stadium of Light to support David [Moyes] and the team, so hopefully many of our travelling supporters will be able to take advantage of this gesture.\" The Arsenal captain, Robin van Persie, has said that nothing less than 100% commitment will produce the result needed at Goodison \u2013 where Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City have all been beaten this year. \"It is tough to play the way we all want. We need to be consistent and get a win over the line, like at Liverpool,\" Van Persie said. \"We did it now, and we can enjoy it, but we need to show it again [at Everton] and it may even be a harder game, but we have to give it our maximum and see where it ends.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
