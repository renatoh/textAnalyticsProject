Eight members of a federal jury in California unanimously decided that Apple\u2019s frequent software updates for iPods legitimately improved the devices, and were not used to block competitors and reduce consumers\u2019 choices. The plaintiffs, who first filed the suit in January 2005, asked for a minimum of $350m and alleged that Apple used software updates to keep songs sold by competitors off the devices. In a statement, Apple welcomed the decision: \u201cwe thank the jury for their service and we applaud their verdict\u201d. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve updated those products,\u201d the statement added, \u201cwe\u2019ve done it to make the user experience even better.\u201d Patrick Coughlin, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they plan to appeal. The jury was asked to decide whether Apple\u2019s software improved its iPods or unfairly restricted what music could be played on iPods sold between 2006 and 2009. Apple\u2019s iPods from that time played only songs synced from CDs or bought from iTunes, a limitation that the plaintiffs said violated antitrust law by forcing people to buy iPods to preserve their music. Coughlin had told the jury that updates wiped those songs off the players completely: \u201cyour iPod is basically a paperweight at that point.\u201d He argued that the software helped Apple tighten its hold on the market for music players. William Isaacson, one of the attorneys for Apple, parried by discrediting the claim wholesale: \u201cthere\u2019s not one piece of evidence of a single individual who lost a single song, not even a complaint about it.\u201d He argued to the jury that the software updates almost invariably improved security or the ability to add movies and auto-sync features. \u201cWe now have a plaintiff and a case asking you to hold Apple liable for innovating,\u201d Isaacson told the jury. The plaintiffs\u2019 case was troubled throughout the trial\u2019s brief duration. Two named plaintiffs were removed after Apple lawyers learned they had not bought iPods during the relevant years. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also threw out one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims after the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness admitted he did not know whether an update made any difference. In the trial\u2019s final days the case continued to change: over the weekend the plaintiffs added a wholly new charge that Apple and Amazon had colluded. Gonzalez Rogers barred the attorneys from even presenting the new allegation. She told the jury to keep to the charges at hand, and to remember that \u201ca company has no general legal duty to assist its competitors, including by making products interoperable\u201d. Jurors were shown emails between Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Jeffrey Robbin, chief of software, in which Jobs warned Robbins about software that could circumvent iTunes. Jobs pressed Robbins to improve anti-piracy software, writing \u201cthere is no gray area on theft\u201d. Apple\u2019s lawyers used the emails to argue that Jobs and the executives wanted to stop hackers, and were not interested in stifling competition, as the plaintiffs alleged. Jobs himself testified to jurors in a video filmed months before his 2011 death. He said \u201cwe were very scared\u201d that hackers would crack Apple\u2019s security and jeopardize the company\u2019s contracts with music labels. Apple stopped using digital rights management software in 2009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
