More than anything, disillusionment with the war was what inspired the Dems' success, so it makes sense that their actions should reflect that. Interestingly, 17 Republicans who survived November's upheavals have also had an apparent change of heart, and voted against Bush's increase in troop numbers. However, it would seem that their main concern is not for the innocent Iraqis who've been flipped from the frying pan of Ba'athist dictatorship into the flames of civil war; but for the poor bloody (US) infantry. The Iraq war is bad, because it's killing Americans. The distinction was put into context recently when Australian prime minister John Howard attacked Barack Obama's calls for troop withdrawal. The response from the Obama camp was not that removing western troops would be best for the Iraqis; it was that Australia should send more troops, \"so some American troops can come home.\" In truth, Obama and his fellow US politicians, from right or left, no longer give a damn what happens in Iraq. They just know that the spiralling death toll among the US forces is proving to be increasingly unpopular with the electorate. I opposed the war from the start but, perhaps perversely, I don't want coalition troops to return for the foreseeable future. Untainted by sectarian labels, a non-Iraqi force appears to be the only thing that prevents the country from slipping into complete anarchy. At the same time, I am deeply sympathetic to the troops who are expected to keep the peace, and to their anxious families. This war is not of their making. And, while anybody who joins the forces should be prepared to fight, it's clear that a disproportionate number of British and American soldiers come from the lower socio-economic groups. This, I suspect, was the point John Kerry was trying to make with his infamous Pasadena speech, but he phrased it so ineptly that no politician will dare to revisit the subject for years, and thousands more poor, underqualified young men and women will join up not out of pure patriotism, but because they have few viable options. So, how to prevent the situation in Iraq from getting even worse, without putting hundreds more innocent mothers through the agonies of bereavement? Well, here is the chance for the hawks of 2003 either to atone for their sins, or to demonstrate that they still believe they were in the right. Every politician in the United Kingdom and the United States (and Australia and Spain and Poland and Thailand and Honduras and Tonga and every other country in the coalition) who voted for the war, and every journalist or other public figure who supported it, should be sent to Iraq immediately. As each neocon senator or hawkish hack emerges blinking onto the streets of Basra or Fallujah, a legitimate grunt or squaddie or Royal can be sent home. I'm particularly keen to see Melanie Phillips dressed as Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now. Blue-on-blue incidents will, in theory, be avoided because, being public figures, they should all recognise each other. Suggestions that few American legislators even know the name of the British foreign secretary should be disregarded as a collective affectation of Reaganesque \"aw shucks\" insularity and ignorance, temporarily adopted for electoral purposes. All these volunteers (all statements made before the war started should be interpreted as a statement of intent and personal commitment) will, of course, be kitted out with the best arms, equipment and protective clothing available. With two exceptions. Messrs Bush and Blair claim to believe that they have the Almighty on their side. Like Sir Philip Sidney at Zutphen, they should be prepared to cast aside their body armour and take on the enemy with faith alone. Armed with sharpened lolly-sticks, clad in their underwear like the two boys who've forgotten their PE kit, they would have the chance to redeem their tarnished reputations, and finally provide us with a lasting, heroic image to represent this least glamorous of conflicts. Maybe Clint Eastwood could make a film about it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
