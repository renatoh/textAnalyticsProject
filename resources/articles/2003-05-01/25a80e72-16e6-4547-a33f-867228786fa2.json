A mildly suicidal type who has been self-mutilating various parts of her body since she was in grade school, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) does not find true love and happiness until she takes a secretarial position with a first-class creep (the reliably bizarre James Spader) who spanks her rather harshly for making simple typing errors. In other words, Secretary is not a reworking of Waterloo Bridge. Whether this curious relationship, poised on a delicate sadomasochistic axis, will ultimately work out is anybody's guess. But this pair of lulus are sure to have plenty of fun on the way. As the film opens, Lee has just re-emerged from the local mental hospital, to whose corridors she has been driven by the behaviour of her boozehound father, neurotic mother and airhead sister. Almost immediately she gets back to work on her thighs with her iodine and razor blades, prompting her mother (Lesley Ann Warren, the poor woman's Susan Sarandon) to lock up all the cutlery, a security precaution Piper Laurie would have been wise to take in Carrie. Meanwhile Lee starts seeing her old flame, a dinky little nebbish who, like her, still lives with his parents. Determined to start a new life, Lee heads off for typing school, where she demonstrates edifying speed and accuracy. These skills ultimately win her a job interview for the position of secretary and general factotum at a local law office run by one E Edwin Grey. Grey, played with just the right mixture of amphibian sleaziness and emotional vacancy that we have come to expect of James Spader, doesn't waste a lot of time before revealing that he is quite the quirky fellow. For starters, his strange, exotic office is a wreck, littered with smashed photographs and scattered files, presumably the work of Lee's predecessor. During the interview, the cataleptic, bug-eyed Grey asks such inappropriate questions as whether the prospective employee is pregnant or even plans to get pregnant. As wacky and generally out of it as her future boss, Lee laughs off these inquiries. She gets the job. An obsessive, repressive type with a penchant for tropical flora, Grey soon makes it clear that Lee's work habits and general demeanour are not up to snuff. She plays with her hair. She listens to a Walkman. She puts too much sugar in his coffee. She is timid on the phone. And she makes typographical errors. One day, Grey calls her into his office, orders her to bend over his desk and read a typo-laden letter out loud while he spanks her. At first Lee is shocked. But it doesn't take her long to get into the swing of things. Before you know it, she is enthusiastically reporting for daily punishments, serving her employer coffee while manacled, crawling into his office with the mail lodged between her teeth, and even allowing him to place a saddle on her back. Lee Holloway, in short, is not the girl next door. Not unless the girl next door is Madonna. It soon becomes clear that in Grey's brand of light, mostly harmless fetishism, Lee has found a less destructive and more socially acceptable outlet for her own masochistic tendencies. This brightens her disposition, so much so that her mother can finally unlock the cutlery drawer for good. Unfortunately, it has a disruptive effect on her relationship with her old boyfriend, now her fiance, who does not respond well to her requests for erotic discipline. But this hardly matters, because her old boyfriend is the kind of guy who never gets the girl in the movie anyway. Pleased by her work and richly entertained by her taskmaster boss, Lee is extremely happy that she took that typing course. But then, for no apparent reason, she finds herself being pushed away by her employer. Seemingly, the mysterious reptile feels guilty about his treatment of his employees; his unusual motivational techniques have led to previous secretaries walking out the door, and may have contributed to the demise of his marriage. The spanking sessions with Lee come to an unexpected end, and Lee is devastated. Still, being a resourceful girl, she is not going to let Grey's guilt destroy their relationship. She loves him; she has fun with him; she doesn't care if he can only have an orgasm when she is wearing knee sox or a saddle. Sometimes you have to give a little to get a little. Secretary, which is generally quite funny, is based on a story by Mary Gaitskill, which is not. In the film, which runs about 30 minutes longer than it should, the director seems to be saying that dangerous, self-destructive tendencies can be channelled into less harmful outlets. Given world enough and time, a mutual passion for corporal punishment can lead to love, whereas fooling around with razor blades will only lead to the emergency ward. Shainberg also seems to be trotting out the tired old theory that in sadomasochistic relationships it is the submissive who is really in charge, if only because she is usually the one wearing the fantastic lingerie. Mostly he seems to be saying: different strokes for different folks. Secretary marks the debut of Ms Gyllenhaal as a leading lady. Alternately sexy and seductive or just plain goofy, the actress has a girlish, expressive face and a bright future, having been touted as the next big thing in circles that like to tout those sorts of things. As for James Spader, all that can be said is: he's at it again. A creep in Less Than Zero, a creep in Sex, Lies And Videotape, a creep in Wolf, a creep in The Watcher, Spader once again does what he does best. He gives you the creeps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
