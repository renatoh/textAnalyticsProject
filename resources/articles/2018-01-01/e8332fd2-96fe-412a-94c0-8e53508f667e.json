We bid him a fond farewell. It all started with a trip to hospital back in 1974. Alan Pickup was visiting the astronomer Norman Matthew, the Guardian\u2019s Night Sky columnist, and found Norman fretting about the column\u2019s rapidly approaching deadline. He volunteered to step in. He took Norman\u2019s star chart, wrote the accompanying notes and posted the whole thing off. He then got married and spent a day of his honeymoon in Ullapool tracking down a copy of the newspaper to see his name in print for the first time. When the next month came, he did it again, only this time there was no pre-prepared star chart. So Alan wrote himself a computer program to calculate the positions of the visible stars. He then plotted these on paper by hand and labelled the constellations with Letraset transfers. In the 43 years since, Alan never missed a single monthly night sky column. This involved using a go-between in the 80s when a posting to the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) took him to Hawaii and \u2013 before email \u2013 out of easy contact with his editors. Now, however, Alan has decided to move on. We wish him all the best for his future endeavours. Starwatch, or The Night Sky as it was first known, has been a feature of the Guardian since July 1909, and it is with honour that I now take over. The change in author coincides with a change in format too as the newspaper switches to tabloid size. We are moving to a weekly Starwatch that will feature the week\u2019s astronomical highlight and how to see it. Clear skies to you all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
