On songs such as Man I Feel Like a Woman, I\u2019m Gonna Getcha Good and That Don\u2019t Impress Me Much, the Canadian singer gave the genre a new lease of life, paving the way for the likes of LeAnn Rimes, Carrie Underwood and \u2013 later \u2013 one Taylor Swift. However, vocal issues, Lyme disease and a messy divorce saw her career stall. Unsurprisingly, Now \u2013 Twain\u2019s first album in 15 years \u2013 is all about bouncing back. On Swingin\u2019 With My Eyes Closed she sings defiantly about how \u201cFear disappears every time I close my eyes\u201d against a tropical-tinged country beat, while Roll Me on the River is a mix of pop empowerment and fiddles that sounds both fresh and reassuring Twain-like. Not all of this musical autobiography quite works, though; Poor Me, about overcoming victimhood, is a try-hard attempt at trip-hop, while the doo-wop-ish You Can\u2019t Buy Love feels overly saccharine. Now is a strong comeback that plays to Twain\u2019s strengths, but it could have done with some more of her feisty, Brad Pitt-skewering self, and fewer inspirational metaphors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
