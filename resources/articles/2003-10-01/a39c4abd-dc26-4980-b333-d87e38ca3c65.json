BA strategists foresee that, if the deal is allowed, it can only strengthen its hand in trying to persuade the US authorities to let it resume talks on the 'Big One' - a deal between BA and American Airlines that would create the leading force in world aviation. The extent of AA's recovery from the 11 September doldrums has not been appreciated in Europe. Since Gerard Arpey became chief executive six months ago, the airline has confronted its unions and taken an axe to costs on a scale Rod Eddington must envy. Its shares have soared away, showing a near tenfold increase since then, making it one of the best performers on Wall Street. All this has been managed without recourse to Chapter 11 subsidy, unlike other US airlines. If BA could successfully revive the deal with AA, still its US partner of choice, it would dwarf all carriers and set a trend for aviation consolidation that really would mean 'open skies' for all. It will probably not happen under a Bush administration, but BA's political antennae are telling them George W may not be much longer in the White House. It's all to play for again in the transatlantic airline business. Joe Six Pack is back in business It's been retailers' weather in New York. A cold snap has sent shoppers out in droves to stock up on those essentials for Big Apple winters - brightly coloured toggle coats and Fair Isle sweaters. At least, if you shop at Gap, that is how you'll look this year (a decidedly seventies retro image). But Gap reported a 13 per cent rise in sales for September - its best performance for many months. In fact, all the big stores have reported good sales in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Goldman Sachs retail index showed an average 6 per cent jump in sales in September. Federated Department Stores, best known for Bloomingdales and Macy's in New York, is on a hiring spree for shopworkers between now and the end of October, having enjoyed a rise of 3 per cent in sales and lifted its third-quarter profits forecast. At the peak, in early 2001, about 15.5 million Americans were employed in the retail sector. Last August, it was just under 15m. But the trend has been upwards ever since. Last month, 10,000 new jobs were created in retail. And, to show that Joe Six Pack, that mythical US shopper who is the mainstay of the consumer-led economy, is no longer staying at home, the giant retailer Wal Mart showed a 6 per cent rise last month. The saying should be updated: 'What's good for Wal Mart is good for America.' Greed is good for Grasso's pals The good times certainly seem to be back in New York. The streets are buzzing, the shops are full, and - a sure sign of Wall Street's health - the hotel bellboys are giving share tips again. 'The market was up again today,' one said to me last week at the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue. 'I hear that XYZ Corp is a damn sure thing.' The Dow Jones hit a 15-month high, and optimists are looking to breach the 10,000 level by December. But if Wall Street is feeling confident again, there is still a dark cloud hanging over the New York Stock Exchange. The Dick Grasso affair refuses to go away, despite the fact that the man himself has walked off with a $140m golden handshake. It has been left to his temporary successor, John Reed, to repair the damage to the NYSE's reputation. Reed's immediate problem is that Grasso left a legacy of hard-to-shake-off corporate extravagance at the NYSE. Catherine Kinney and Robert Britz, two of his inner circle, are in line for $30m pay-offs on retirement, on top of salaries exceeding $2m a year. Their windfalls, too, come from 'savings' made during their 30-odd years at the exchange. Reed is trying to end this incestuous culture by hiring headhunters to find the new NYSE chief executive and chairman. The odds on a non-American ending up in the top job at the NYSE are very long indeed - whereas in Britain those kinds of jobs increasingly go to non-Brits. But maybe the appointment of a foreigner would be in tune with what seems to be a new Wall Street ethos. One NYSE trader, quoted in the New York Times last week in relation to the Grasso scandal, said: 'Greed is not good. Greed is a sin.' Gordon Gekko would choke on his cigar. Concorde: a case of spills'n'thrills My first flight on Concorde was 10 years ago, and it was a thrill. All they said about it was true: the take-off G-forces throwing you back into your seat, the kick you get when the plane goes supersonic, the curvature of the earth at 60,000 feet. Fantastic. All that is still there, but, without wishing to appear ungrateful to British Airways, who picked up my \u00a34,000-plus ticket for a trip on the plane last week, it isn't quite the same any more. Instead of celebs, captains of industry and glitterati, my fellow passengers could have just switched from a budget charter. Since BA announced earlier this year that it was retiring the plane, it has nearly always been full. Anyone who ever wanted a flying experience this side of space has blown their savings on a Concorde trip. And what do you do on the trip of a lifetime? Get as drunk as you can, apparently - which rather takes the shine off what was once the height of sophistication. BA doesn't seem to mind these supersonic booze cruises though. Ever since the lay-off news Concorde has been making money, they say, getting ready to offset the \u00a380m it will cost to decommission. 'Maybe we should retire it every year,' said a BA man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
