But poor old Jim Furyk, though. Huh? That\u2019s ten top-ten finishes here now, without a single win. Bogeys at the last for both Gentleman Jim and Justin Rose, the overnight leaders. They both shot miserable 72s, and have to do with a share of third. So this is how things finished, the story of Shane Lowry\u2019s ascension in bald facts and figures. -11: Lowry -9: Watson -7: Rose, Furyk -6: Streb -5: Lingmerth, Lee, Koepka, Stenson -4: Spieth, Fowler Could he follow in Rory McIlroy\u2019s footsteps by winning the PGA title a week after the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational? Please join me to find out. We go again on Thursday! The champion speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe. I played good today. I was nervous there towards the end, but I made a couple of good decisions and got a bit of luck too. I\u2019ve doubted myself this year when things haven\u2019t gone my way, but to come out the other end, it\u2019s nice. The putt at 14 was massive. That was key to me winning. I was just trying to lag that last putt down there, but it dropped in. It\u2019s exciting. There\u2019s a party on at home this evening, my brother, my fiancee, my parents and my granny. It\u2019s great for me, my family, and everyone who\u2019s supported me over the years.\u201d That was all said not so much in an Irish accent, but in the accent of smile. Audible glee in every word. Could there be a more likeable champion? Lowry wheeled around in glee as his putt dropped, as well he might! He becomes the third Irish player to win this event, after Darren Clarke in 2003 and Rory McIlroy last year. That\u2019s a sensational victory. The two escapes from the trees, at 10 and 18, will be the signature shots of Lowry\u2019s breakthrough win. But perhaps his putting under pressure sealed the deal: that huge par saver across 14 was as good a putt as any all week. All year, perhaps. And that up and down at 17! This was a swashbuckling win - but it required some steady control too. All hail the all-round brilliance of Shane Lowry - who has now surely stepped up into the elite ranks. SHANE LOWRY IS THE WGC-BRIDGESTONE CHAMPION! Lowry curls his putt, right to left, into the cup. After a recovery shot for the ages - his second such shot of the day, in fact - he birdies the last, and secures a richly deserved victory! That\u2019s a bogey-free 66, and he ends the day at -11. That\u2019s his first PGA Tour win, and at at WGC event too! What a performance. Shane Lowry has come of age this weekend! ... this is a STUNNER! Lowry whips his ball up and over the tree. It brushes a few leaves as it comes back down, then drops into the heart of the green, pin high, 12 feet from the flag! What a brilliant escape! Tiger, Mickelson, Seve, Lowry. That\u2019s how he\u2019s been rolling today. Back on 17, Furyk and Rose both take two putts for par. This is nearly over. Two putts for Lowry, and this is over! -10: Lowry (17) -9: Watson (F) -8: Furyk (17), Rose (17) It\u2019s all relative, of course, but Lowry has enjoyed a massive slice of luck here. His ball is in a small clearing within the trees, and he\u2019s got enough space to get over the branches in front of him. Just. Can he manufacture something as good as the ludicrous feat of escapology on 10? Hell, half as good would do. He opens the face of his wedge, and ... ... he\u2019s pulled his drive at 18 into the trees down the left. Aw Shane! Goodness knows if he\u2019ll have a shot out of that. Dear me. Meanwhile back on 17, Furyk and Rose both find the green in regulation. They\u2019re faced with long birdie putts - Rose lets his frustration get the better of him with a highly English \u201cGosh!\u201d - but they\u2019re both still in this tournament. As things stand. A lot depends on where Lowry\u2019s ball has ended up, naturally. Lowry bumps a pretty fine chip across 17. He\u2019s done well to get within five feet. But that\u2019s going to look like 25 feet to Lowry right now. The pressure\u2019s really on here. This man is made of the real stuff, though! He rolls the par saver straight into the cup! That\u2019s 17 holes played without a single blemish on his card. One more hole, one more par, one more bogey avoided - and chances are he\u2019ll be winning his first PGA Tour championship. A WGC event, nonetheless. One more good drive, Shane. Just one more good drive. But ... This isn\u2019t brilliant play by Shane Lowry. From the centre of 17, he pulls his approach, his ball nestling against the thick rough skirting the edge of the green on the left. He\u2019s got a long up and down from there. Back on 16, Furyk nearly lobs in from the rough at the back. He saves his par, and he\u2019s not out of this tournament yet. And neither is Rose, who bumps his third into the green to eight feet, and finally makes a putt! His birdie takes him to -8, alongside Furyk. One behind Bubba, and two behind the leader. In fact, if Lowry can\u2019t scramble another par at 17, a four-way play-off isn\u2019t beyond the realms here! -10: Lowry (16) -9: Watson (F) -8: Rose (16), Furyk (16) An iron off the 17th tee for Shane Lowry. It\u2019s in the fairway, as you\u2019d expect from a professional playing the percentages. Furyk can\u2019t afford to take a safety-first approach, though, and toys with the water at the front of 16. He fizzes a low scuttler into the green, his ball nestling in the rough at the back. Probably the best he could do from the thick stuff down the side of the fairway; he wasn\u2019t going to hold the green coming in high. Lowry gets up and down, and that\u2019s his par on 16. He\u2019s leading by one stroke. Back down the hole, Furyk had in fact found a bunker with a steep face, and he can only lash out into the rough further down the right. This could be the end of his challenge if he\u2019s not very careful. Rose has got no option but to roll the dice, and lashes a fairway wood down the track. He clips the trees down the left, and gets a lucky bounce back onto the fairway. And up on 18, Bubba\u2019s long birdie putt stays up on the right, and he taps in for par. That\u2019s a wondrous round of 66, and he\u2019s set a clubhouse target of -9. Shane Lowry, still out on the course with two to play, has it all in his own hands. -10: Lowry (16) -9: Watson (F) -8: Furyk (15) -7: Rose (15) Lowry\u2019s third into 16 is right on line, but short of distance. His ball lands just over the water in front of the green, and rather kindly opts not to spin back. He should be able to get up and down from there, with not too much green between ball and hole. But that was a nervous moment. Back on the tee, Rose powers a drive down the fairway, though it takes the camber to the left and topples into the rough. Furyk lashes his into deep bother down the other side. And up on 18, Bubba sends his second over the flag, but it\u2019s a good 25 feet behind the hole, and doesn\u2019t spin back. Not particularly good from where he was. There\u2019ll be some noise if he rolls that one in for birdie, mind. Bubba\u2019s eight-foot putt goes straight into the cup! What a ludicrous birdie! That was one of the stupidest drives in the history of All Golf - but what a wedge over the trees! He\u2019s just a shot behind the leader Lowry - who powers out of the rough on 16, laying up in the middle of the fairway down the behemoth par-five. Furyk can\u2019t convert his birdie chance on 15; it\u2019s par for both him and Rose. And back to Bubba, who blasts a ludicrously long drive down the final hole. It flirted with the branches down the left, but drifted back inside, and he\u2019s left with a dainty chip into the green. It\u2019s a 460-plus-yard hole. -10: Lowry (15) -9: Watson (17) -8: Furyk (15) -7: Rose (15) Bubba\u2019s not giving this up quickly! He\u2019s right behind a small tree, miles to the right of 17. No bother! He opens the face of his club, and thrash-Mickelsons a high lob over the branches and down to within eight feet of the flag! That\u2019s astonishingly good. Bubbaesque. He does this sort of thing. Furyk isn\u2019t laying down either: he\u2019s nearly holed in one at the par-three 15th. The ball rolls six feet past, so that\u2019s not dead for birdie. And on 16, Lowry\u2019s drive finds the thick stuff down the left. So this isn\u2019t over. What a marvellous final round this has been! Bubba can\u2019t rake in his 25-footer for birdie on 16. He smiles and shakes his head as he taps in for par, the look of a man who knows he needed something there, and is now relying on Lowry to throw it away. Doubly so after hoicking his drive at 17 miles right and into the trees. Danger there, Bubba! Meanwhile the leader whip-cracks his tee shot into the heart of 15. He looks in total control today. And on the couple of occasions where he\u2019s momentarily lost control... well, he\u2019s quickly, er, regained control. It\u2019s been a display of poise and class. And control! He\u2019s so close. So close for this to have become very tense viewing. But at least one person is relaxed, and thankfully that\u2019s our leader. Two putts later - a 30-foot birdie effort stopping just short - and that\u2019s another par. He\u2019s three from home. Rose and Furyk meanwhile grind out pars on 14, to stay in touch. -10: Lowry (15) -8: Watson (16), Furyk (14) -7: Rose (14) What a putt from Shane Lowry! He rolls a right-to-left drifter into the cup from 25 feet, a stunning par save! That looked like a certain bogey, but he\u2019d kept one off his card up until this point, and clearly had no intention of bringing that proud run to an end. That\u2019s just brilliant, tenacious golf. If he doesn\u2019t win this tournament, let nobody say he gave up without a fight, or left stupid shots out on the course. And if he does... well, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, a long way to go. But an already fantastic player could be about to take the next step up. Rose does get up and down! He\u2019s still in with a shout here, despite it all. Furyk pars 13 too. Up on 14, the lip\u2019s too high for Lowry to consider going for the green. He takes his medicine and chips out. He bumps his wedge into the heart of the green, the pin tucked away on the left. He\u2019ll have work to do to save his par. And on 16, Bubba lashes an iron from the rough down the fairway, then sends his approach over the flag. It lands 25 feet behind the flag, but doesn\u2019t spin back. You sense Bubba was expecting some spin, because he briefly considers snapping his iron over his knee. He shapes to do exactly that, then simmers down in double-quick time. Driving mishaps ahoy! The biggest hour of Lowry\u2019s career doesn\u2019t start particularly well. Minute one: he pulls his drive into a bunker down the left of 14. \u201cAw no, Shane, no!\u201d he cries as his ball nestles up against the lip of the trap. Maybe he\u2019ll have just enough space to go for the green. Time will tell. Down 16, Bubba wangs an awful tee shot miles right, but gets a lucky bounce back towards the fairway. He\u2019s still in the rough, but not bothered by trees. And to complete the triptych of tee tat: Rose whistles his drive into the woods down the right of 13, and though he gets a favourable bounce off a branch back onto the fairway, he\u2019s miles back, and fails to reach the green with his second. He\u2019ll have an up and down you feel he really needs to make ... though just about everybody\u2019s in danger of dropping shots here. Firestone South is a Monster all right. No birdie for Rose at 12: he stays at -7. It\u2019s just not happening for him. And contrasting fortunes for Bubba and Lowry with their chips on 15 and 13 respectively. Bubba fluffs his, then lets an impatient prod of a putt slip left of the cup. Bogey, and he\u2019s back to -8. Lowry meanwhile caresses a gorgeous bump and run out of the thick stuff, to within a couple of feet of the hole. That\u2019s another hard-as-nails up and down, and Lowry is two clear as we enter the business end of this WGC event. The biggest hour of his career so far is about to unfold! -10: Lowry (13) -8: Watson (15), Furyk (12) -7: Rose (12) Furyk can only wedge up the bank at 12 and straight through the green. He\u2019s in the apron on the other side. He jabs a chip to a couple of feet, but that\u2019ll be a bogey, and he\u2019s back to -8. But that might not be as disastrous as it sounds, for Lowry\u2019s in a little trouble at 13: having boomed a huge drive down the track, he\u2019s overhit his second, and into the thick rough behind the green. While on the par-three 15th, Bubba has seen his ball disappear into tangled rough just to the right of the green, and he\u2019s shortsided. Rose sends a seemingly effortless iron into the heart of 12. So smooth. Pin high, and a chance for a birdie. He really needs to roll this one in, from 18 feet, because time\u2019s running out. Here\u2019s how the leaders stand right now: -10: Lowry (12) -9: Watson (14), Furyk (11) -7: Rose (11) -6: Stenson (13) -5: Bowditch (12) A superb tee shot from Lowry at 12, ten feet straight over the flag. He smoothly sends a gentle left-to-right curler along the green, but it stays high on the left, and he\u2019s staying at -10. But he\u2019s got through a difficult hole without dropping a shot, and that\u2019s something Jim Furyk might not be able to say any time soon; he\u2019s sliced his tee shot miles right and down a very troublesome bank. A chance for another birdie for Bubba, this time at 14, but his 20-foot ticker from the back of the green stays up on the left side. He stays at -9, alongside Furyk (f0r now). Furyk has been plodding around today, but he steps up the quality now, wedging into 11 to six feet. One of the approaches of the day, and a superb chance for birdie. Rose really needs to respond, and he does so, sticking his second over the flag to ten feet. But he can\u2019t put the birdie putt away. He remains at -7. The putter\u2019s not working. Unless there\u2019s a dramatic change, this isn\u2019t going to be Justin Rose\u2019s tournament. But Furyk isn\u2019t giving this up, and he pops his birdie putt in. He\u2019s back to -9, a shot off the lead. The first sign that the pressure of leading such a big tournament may tell on Shane Lowry? From the centre of 11, he pushes a simple wedge into the bunker to the right of the green. That\u2019s an appalling shot. But what a recovery, splashing out to three feet, then tapping home for his par. Pressure? What pressure?! He looked shaky there for a minute, but what a strong response. Magnificent. But outside forces are certain to continue bearing down, because there\u2019s a huge cheer, as Bubba rolls a 35-foot birdie putt straight across 13 and into the cup! That\u2019s his fourth birdie in six holes! And he\u2019s one off the lead! -10: Lowry (11) -9: Watson (13) -8: Furyk (10) -7: Rose (10) Rose drives into sand down the right of 10, but isn\u2019t bothered by the lip of the bunker and lifts a glorious second to 10 feet. He\u2019ll have a look at another birdie. Furyk finds the green in regulation, albeit in a less swashbuckling manner. He\u2019ll have a long two putts for par. Or will he rake in a 40-footer for birdie? Dearie me, he very nearly does. So unlucky for that not to drop. He stays at -8. Rose then three putts dismally. He\u2019s back to -7. His putter has gone stone cold today. Maybe he should try chipping everything in. Some very necessary admin, then, in the wake of that glorious nonsense! Furyk trundled in a 15-footer to scramble his par on 9, while Bubba did well to get up and down from the side of 12 to avoid dropping a shot. This is a brilliant tournament, a highly entertaining final round, and it\u2019s surely only going to get better and better! -10: Lowry (10) -8: Watson (12), Rose (9), Furyk (9) Two sensational shots, and the European charge is on!!! First, finally, something happens for Justin Rose! Having found the rough down the right of 9, he sends his second through the back. But he bumps a delightful chip onto the green, sending it curling right to left, a delicate 25-foot trundle that disappears into the cup for birdie! He\u2019s back to -8! Meanwhile Lowry, amid thick nonsense down the left of 10, hoicks a high open-faced wedge over a tree and onto a bank to the left of the green, the ball bouncing to the right, resting a couple of feet from the pin! That\u2019s Tiger, mixed with Lefty, sprinkled with a soupcon of Seve!!! He makes his birdie, and Lowry\u2019s lead is two! Jordan Spieth won\u2019t be winning this tournament, but he\u2019s the current clubhouse leader. He\u2019s just sent a crisp approach at 18 to three feet, then tapped in for his birdie. Out in 32, he\u2019s back in 34, and that\u2019s a 66. He\u2019s -4, and in superlative form ahead of the PGA Championship next week. A third major of the year for the brilliant young Texan? You wouldn\u2019t back too aggressively against it, would you. Bubba, wedging into 11, sees his ball bounce twice, then twang 12 feet back off the flagstick. Unfortunate: had that landed on the putting surface one more time, it\u2019d surely have bitten close to the hole. As it is, he\u2019s still got a look at yet another birdie. But he pulls it right and that\u2019s just a par. His face suggests a high miff. He remains at -8. Elsewhere, some wild drives, Furyk flaying one miles left down 9, Lowry forced to scream FORE! as he skelps one in a similar direction on 10. Meanwhile we have a new clubhouse leader: Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark, who shot 66 today and ends his tournament at -3. Furyk can only find the thick stuff at the front left of 8, and doesn\u2019t chip particularly close from there. A bogey, and suddenly Rose\u2019s rather boring par at the same hole suddenly looks more interesting. He\u2019s only a shot behind his playing partner, and two off the lead. Speaking of which: Lowry, having driven into the trees down the left of 9, bumps a wedge to the rough at front of the green, then chips adroitly to four feet. A stunning par scramble, and he\u2019s out in 33, the sole leader of this tournament. Meanwhile bogey for Day at 13, and he drops back to -5. He walks off with the look of a man who knows it\u2019s over. It is over. -9: Lowry (9) -8: Watson (10), Furyk (8) -7: Rose (8) -6: Stenson (9), Bowditch (9) Shane Lowry is the joint leader of the tournament! He wedges to six feet at 8, and rolls in the putt. This round is a slow burner, but that\u2019s his second birdie of the day, and he\u2019s now -9 alongside Furyk - who, behind the Irish star, drives into filth down the right of the same hole. It could be All Change at the top soon, because up on 10, Bubba is in trouble in the trees down the left of 10. But he bumps a Scottish style wedge over a couple of banks, avoiding some tufts, and onto the green to ten feet! That\u2019s an absurd, snaky route, and such a delightful shot. He rolls in the birdie effort, and is a shot off the lead at -8! This round is really coming to the boil! -9: Lowry (8), Furyk (7) -8: Watson (10) -7: Rose (7) By the way, the new Open champion Zach Johnson has finished the week at +2. He\u2019s historically found it difficult to get people to warm to him, has poor Zach. But his performance after winning at St Andrews must have won a few hearts and minds. Not only was his acceptance speech extremely gracious and humble, he also made sure to exchange high fives with as many of the punters lining the 18th hole as possible. It took him bloody ages. He\u2019ll have made a lot of people\u2019s days doing that. The little gestures. And it made for strangely therapeutic viewing. But I digress. A fuss-free par for Furyk at 7, and he remains at -9. Rose can\u2019t get up and down from the bunker, though. His splash out is cute enough, four feet past the hole, but he lets the par putt dribble past the left of the cup, and he\u2019s back to -7. Rose is the only player towards the top of the leaderboard - the only one in the top 11, to be precise - to be over par today. Furyk (-9) and Brooks Koepka (-4) are the only others from that bunch not to be under par. It\u2019s going to get very interesting, you sense. Bubba booms one down the 9th, and wedges his second pin high. It screws towards the hole, leaving a three footer for his birdie. And in it pops. He\u2019s suddenly in fourth spot, just two off Furyk\u2019s lead. Meanwhile Stenson is close to rolling in a 15-footer across 8 for birdie, but remains at -6. Rose slam-dunks his tee shot at 7 into the bunker, front right of the green. There\u2019s not much putting surface to work with from there. Furyk, following, plays safely into the heart of the green. News of Rickie Fowler, meanwhile: he quietly went out in 33 strokes, with birdies at 2 and 9, and has just birdied 12. He\u2019s three under for his round, and -4 for the tournament. And we\u2019ve got new clubhouse leaders: Paul Casey and Lee Westwood have ended their weeks at -1, having shot 67 and 68 today respectively. Furyk sends a 9-iron into the 6th, leaving a 15-foot uphill putt for birdie. The effort shaves the hole. He remains at -9. Rose left himself a long two putts for par, but makes it to hang on in there at -8. As does Lowry up on 7, despite leaving his first 60-footer a good ten feet short. -9: Furyk (6) -8: Lowry (7), Rose (6) -6: Day (10), Watson (8), Stenson (7), Bowditch (7) Poulter\u2019s day goes from bad to worse. He\u2019s put his tee shot at the par-three 7th into a bunker. And shanks his escape into another trap! He splashes out to three feet, a shot of delicate precision. From rank amateur to professional genius in 60 seconds. But that\u2019s another bogey, and he\u2019s back to -3. After that eagle at 2, and a sniff of the top of the leaderboard, this has been a dismal collapse. A two-putt par for Stenson, who remains at -6. Meanwhile birdie for Bubba at 8, and he\u2019s -6. He\u2019s been quiet, but not out of this yet. A huge break for Rose at 5. His tee shot is pushed well right, but clips a branch and rebounds back into the green, allowing him to escape with a two-putt par. He\u2019s not playing with much confidence right now. And this 24 hours after shooting 63! This, ladies and gentlemen, is why we love and hate golf so much, in equal measure. Furyk meanwhile fails to get up and down from the fringe, missing a short par putt, and his lead now is just the one. Meanwhile Stenson and Poulter both drop shots at 6. They\u2019re back to -6 and -4 respectively. And Day pars 10, having nearly holed out from a greenside bunker. Nobody ahead of him is exactly ripping it up. Another couple of birdies, and you never know. Day gets up and down from a tight spot at the front of 9. Having saved his par, he\u2019s out in 31 strokes, and looks very content with life. He\u2019s -6, and has to be fancied for next week\u2019s jamboree at Whistling Straits. Meanwhile an easy par for Furyk at 4, but Rose hits a weak chip from the rough at the back. He can\u2019t knock in the ten-footer he leaves himself. One bogey in the last 49 holes becomes two in 50. All of a sudden it\u2019s falling apart for the 2013 US Open winner. And falling into place for the man who won it ten years earlier. -10: Furyk (4) -8: Lowry (5), Rose (4) -7: Stenson (5) -6: Day (9), Bowditch (5) Rose has a route into the green at 4, but gets a flyer out of the rough and it zips into the long stuff behind the green. Furyk, perhaps sensing his time is now, providing he plays it safe and steady, guides his second into the heart of the green. The gap at the top of the leaderboard could be growing soon. Meanwhile Lowry\u2019s tee shot into 5 is miles to the left of the flag, albeit on the green. A 60-footer is left a good 15 feet short, but he rattles in a staunch saver, and remains at -8. He\u2019s not quite been firing on all cylinders, but he\u2019s yet to make any errors, and remains one under for his round thanks to that birdie at 2. He\u2019s -8. Workaday pars for Furyk and Rose at 3, and for Lowry and Bowditch at 4. Furyk finds the fairway from the tee at 4, but Rose wings his drive into the trees down the right. More trouble for the 54-hole joint leader. Stenson can\u2019t make his birdie at 5. Poulter scrambles his par after bumping up to four feet, a fine recovery. But he\u2019s clinging on, rather than making the necessary charge. As for McDowell? He fails to get up and down from a bunker at 7, and he\u2019s back to -3. Any outside chance of victory for the 2010 US Open champ has long gone. Poulter\u2019s race certainly looks run. Frustrated in the wake of the double that dropped him back to -5, he chunks his tee shot at the par-three 5th. He\u2019ll have a testing up and down from the front of the green. His partner Stenson is still in the hunt at -7, though, and finds the heart of the green; he\u2019ll have a look at birdie. Menawhile another birdie for Jason Day, this time at 8! He\u2019s the hottest property on the course right now. He\u2019s four under for his round, -6 overall, and just four off the lead. Does another Tour win loom, a mere fortnight after his superb success at the Canadian Open? Suddenly, while still a long shot, it\u2019s not totally out of the question. Perhaps not. He\u2019s just hooked his drive into trees down the left of 3. Bubba had to chip out from there. But he punches one onto the green. The ball leaks off the back, but that\u2019s not the worst result from there. Meanwhile on 4, Poulter finds the second cut with his tee shot, fizzes a no-spin hottie through the green, clumps a heavy handed chip miles back past the hole, and can\u2019t make the long par putt. Or the two-foot tiddler he leaves himself for bogey, pushed way to the right. A dreadful double, and he\u2019s back to -5. That was a tatty nonsense from start to finish. What with the Arsenal-West Ham result earlier, it\u2019s not looking like Poulter\u2019s day. Lowry gets up and down from the fringe at the back of 3 to remain in third spot at -8. Bowditch is an inch away from a successful 20-foot birdie effort, but he stays at -6. Meanwhile Furyk fizzes a hybrid straight through the green at 2. A little bump out of the rough at the back sends his ball to four feet, and he rolls in the putt for his first birdie of the day. His partner Rose finds the front of the putting surface, and he\u2019ll have a long one up the green for eagle. A 35-foot effort travels 40 feet. And he doesn\u2019t get the one coming back. It horseshoes out. That\u2019s his first three-putt of the week, 56 holes into the event. And what a time to do it. We have a new sole leader, and it\u2019s Jim Furyk - who, er, doesn\u2019t much like setting the pace. He\u2019s failed to convert any of his last nine 54-hole leads into a win. Can he make it tenth time lucky? -10: Furyk (2) -9: Rose (2) -8: Lowry (3) -7: Poulter (3), Stenson (3) McDowell\u2019s early momentum is lost, with a dropped shot at 4. He\u2019s back to -4, and out of this now. The margin for error is that slim. Perhaps to the point where early missed birdie chances could sting more than usual: there\u2019s agony for Poulter at 3, as a 25-foot birdie effort across the green lips out. So close. As is Bubba at 4, but his 30-footer for bird stays on the high side. He\u2019s still -5. Lowry and Bowditch chipping greenside at the par-five 2nd. Lowry\u2019s effort is hot, 20 feet past the hole. Bowditch bumps his up to three feet. Two birdie putts, then, of varying likelihood. But Lowry rattles his in at high speed! What a putt! That could have been disastrous had the hole not got in the way. But the ball drops, and he moves to within a shot of the lead. His partner pops his less dramatic effort into the cup, and the leaderboard now looks a little more compact than it did at the start of the day ... -9: Rose (1), Furyk (1) -8: Lowry (2) -7: Poulter (2), Stenson (2) -6: Bowditch (2) Shades of the Ryder Cup at Medinah here, Furyk versus Garcia. Big Jim hits a putt. He\u2019s sure it\u2019s going to drop. He walks after it in celebration - only to see it hook round the back of the cup and stay out. How did that not drop? Par. Rose matches his score in a fairly nondescript fashion. No fuss, no drama. Meanwhile Bubba is all over the shop on the par-four 3rd. Out of position from the tee, he\u2019s wedging his third into the green, and pulls it miles right. It\u2019s on the green, but he\u2019s left with a long putt to save his par. He can\u2019t make it. He\u2019s back to -5. As is his partner Streb, only he\u2019s been going in a different direction. Having dropped that shot at 1, he\u2019s birdied 2 and now raked a long one in at 3 for another birdie. A fine response. Stenson rips his second into the par-five 2nd pin high. He\u2019s got a fairly straight 30-footer across the green for his eagle, and he so nearly drains it. But that\u2019s back-to-back birdies, and he joins Lowry in second place at -7. As does his partner Poulter, whose second whistled 20 feet past the flag. He teases in the snaky eagle putt, and walks off the green with a very businesslike look on his face. Meanwhile Spieth has grabbed back the shot he dropped at 7, with a birdie at 9. He went out in 32, and is now -4 overall. Camilo Villegas did indeed finish his round with a pair of pars. He signs for a 65, the best round of the day so far, and ends the tournament at level par. He\u2019s the joint clubhouse leader alongside Matt Kuchar, who shot a 68 today. What the final pair would give for Villegas\u2019s card. Rose and Furyk are out and about, and they\u2019ve found the fairway with their opening tee shots. Everyone who is anyone is on the course now. This, ladies and gentlemen, is on. Surf\u2019s up! Bubba has a 15-footer for eagle at 2, but never looks like sinking the putt. A birdie will suffice, and he moves to -6. G-Mac clips his second at 3 to ten feet. But he can\u2019t guide the birdie putt into the cup. He stays at -5. On 1, Lowry whistles his wedge straight at the flag, the ball stopping six feet shy. An easy uphill putt from Poulter Country, but he sends it curling dismally to the right, and that\u2019s just a par. No fast start for Lowry, then. Henrik Stenson\u2019s approach into 1 is right over the flag. It bites and spins back to ten feet. He tickles in the birdie putt, and he\u2019s -6, in fourth place on his own, three off the lead. Ian Poulter, his playing partner today, finds the middle of the green in two, but seriously overhits his long birdie putt, leaving himself an eight-foot tester coming back up the green. He slots it away nicely. Like G-Mac before him, that could be a crucial momentum saver. A dropped shot at the fairly easy opening hole would have been a blow. Back on the tee, it\u2019s the penultimate pairing. Both Steven Bowditch and Shane Lowry find the fairway, the latter hitting a monster drive, fuelled by adrenalin no doubt. Lowry is desperate to lift one of the big prizes. Being interviewed ahead of his round, he spoke of that desire. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen today, it\u2019ll happen some other time.\u201d Refreshingly relaxed for an elite sports star, but of course he said exactly the same thing ahead of the final round at the US Open, and never quite got going around Chambers Bay, shooting a water-treading 71. Seize the moment, Shane. So naturally, Bubba bumps his chip up the hill to the green and very nearly into the cup. He\u2019s saved his par rather majestically, and remains -5. Streb can\u2019t get up and down, though, and he\u2019s back to -3. Up ahead, Koepka bumbles his way up 2, and bogeys one of the more inviting holes on the course. He drops to -3. His partner McDowell, however, creams his second into the heart of the green, and sees his eagle putt from 25 feet stop a couple of dimples short. He birdies, a fine start for the 2010 US Open champion. He\u2019s -5, and a feature of this early new leaderboard... -9: Rose, Furyk -7: Lowry -5: Day (3), McDowell (2), Watson (1), Bowditch, Poulter, Stenson Robert Streb pulls his opening tee shot into McDowell Country, then fails to hit his wedge into the green. He\u2019s short of the putting surface, and faces a tricky up and down to save his par. Streb\u2019s partner is Bubba, who also fluffs his wedge in, from the first cut. That\u2019s abysmal. He too faces a par-saving test, right from the get-go. Meanwhile Day\u2019s fast start continues: he splits the fairway at 3, then wedges to five feet. That\u2019ll surely be three birdies in a row. Yep. He\u2019s -5, just four off the lead. Much more of this, and he\u2019ll be giving the final pairings something to think about. G-Mac is out and about, and his opening drive is swallowed up by the rough down the left of the hole. No fairway, no spin, and his approach can\u2019t hold the green. He severely underhits his chip from the back, leaving himself a 20-footer for par. But he slides in a gentle right-to-left putt, and punches the air in the modest manner. That was a real momentum saver, and it retains his outside chance of doing something special here; he\u2019s still -4. As is his playing partner Brooks Koepka, who parred the hole with much less fuss and faff. Day is this close from draining another monster, this time for eagle from the fringe at 2. He holds his head in his hands, just as he did on the 18th at St Andrews last month, but this time he\u2019s got a broad smile on his face. That\u2019s another birdie, and he\u2019s -4. His playing partner, the 2011 PGA champion Keegan Bradley, fails to get up and down from the back of the par-five, dropping a shot and falling back to -1. On a hole that\u2019s been giving up birdies, that\u2019ll feel like a double. Meanwhile Spieth drops a shot at 7, his tee shot nestling in the long stuff surrounding the green, a chip then fluffed. He can\u2019t roll in the 25-foot saver. He\u2019s back to -2. Birdie for Rickie Fowler at the par-five 2nd, a putt trundled in from 18 feet. He moves to -2. Kevin Na has added to the shot he picked up at 2 with another at 4; he\u2019s -2 overall. There was another birdie for Camilo Villegas, at 14. Currently safely through 16, if he pars his way home he\u2019ll be signing for a best-of-day 65. He really is one of the streakiest players on the circuit. If only he could string a few more of these Mickelsonesque birdie bursts together, he\u2019d have a better CV in the majors than three top-ten finishes, all between 2008 and 2010. Perhaps he\u2019ll show well in next week\u2019s PGA, a major tournament he\u2019s enjoyed more than most. Let\u2019s hope so. Incidentally, he\u2019s 33 years old already! I think I\u2019ve had him mentally pegged at 26 for quite some time now. At least seven years. Where does it all go? As for the topic of Sergio Garcia, let\u2019s not start pulling threads, lest we all mentally unravel. Yes, there are shots out here. A couple of quick early birdies from Patrick Reed, at 2 and now 3, having spun his approach to a couple of feet in an extremely pleasing aesthetic style. He\u2019s -2. The in-form Jason Day has just teased in a giant right-to-left downhill breaker on the opening hole for a birdie that takes him to -3. Spieth meanwhile should have made it three birdies in a row at 6, but his approach spun back rather unfortunately to 15 feet, having landed ten feet from the hole, and he failed to hit the putt. Par, and he remains at -3. But he looks in the mood today. Then again, when doesn\u2019t Jordan Spieth look in the mood? Misery has relentlessly tracked Liang Wen-Chong around Firestone South today. Out in 39 strokes was bad enough. The notorious closing stretch put the tin lid on it. Three bogeys in a row between 12 and 14 were followed by back-to-back doubles at 15 and 16. Back in 42 shots, and that\u2019s an eleven-over 81. He ends the tournament at +21, but escapes the shame of last place thanks to Troy Merritt, whose opening-day 82 was the worst round of the week; Merritt props up the field at +22. Even Big Dustin, who has dropped another stroke, this time at 7, to fall to +6, won\u2019t be able to save Merritt from his fate. Another birdie for Spieth! He dumps his tee shot into a bunker to the left of 5, but splashes out, sending his ball scampering straight towards the hole and in. He\u2019s -3. Wonderful stuff from The New Hogan Were It Not For The Eighth Green On The Old Course. Meanwhile the round of the day so far has been made by Hideki Matsuyama. The young Japanese star will surely contend next weekend at the PGA, as he\u2019s in very good nick, having signed for a six-under 66 today. A real boost at the end of a mixed week; at +3, he\u2019s currently the clubhouse leader, though that of course won\u2019t be lasting for long. A fast start for Jordan Spieth. If we\u2019re being honest with ourselves, the brilliant Masters and US Open champion is too far behind to trouble the leaders, having started the day at level par. But he\u2019s birdied 2, and now drained a 30-footer on 4 for another birdie, to move to -2 in double-quick time. Sergio Garcia, also level par after three rounds, started out with a birdie, but he sent his drive at 3 behind a tree, then chunked a wedge into the water. A double, and he\u2019s back to +1. I would say he\u2019s saving up all his luck for next weekend\u2019s major championship, but we know what always happens in those for Po\u2019 Sergio. Here we go, then, and Firestone\u2019s playing fast and firm and long today. Like that\u2019s news. But - glad tidings here for the pack chasing Rose, Furyk and Lowry - there are birdie chances out there. Camilo Villegas was out in 31 strokes, with birdies at 2, 4, 7 and 9; he\u2019s +1 overall through 13. Billy Horschel is three under for his round after 13 holes; he\u2019s +1 too. And Lee Westwood started his round with three birdies in a row, to move to -2 overall. Not that the course isn\u2019t occasionally baring its teeth too. Westwood has since dropped a shot at 6, while his playing partner Dustin Johnson has started 5-5-6-3-5-4, a run containing two double bogeys, a bogey and a birdie. His double at 3 was the result of a sand shot thinned straight through the green. He\u2019s +5. The only way is up for the big man. One hopes. It\u2019s fair to say Jim Furyk is due another big victory. Since winning the US Open all those years ago, at Olympia Fields in 2003, he\u2019s had nine top-ten finishes in the majors. It\u2019s a run that\u2019s included two second places in the US Open, a second place at the PGA, a fourth-placed finish at the Open, plus a tie for tenth at Augusta. He\u2019s also finished in the top ten of a World Golf Championship event on 14 occasions. But he\u2019s never won one. At this particular tournament, he\u2019s finished in the top ten nine times. It\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s due another big one. It looked as though this might be his time. Midway through the second day, having posted his second 66, he was six shots clear of the field. By the time everyone completed their rounds, he was still four clear at the halfway point. But yesterday Justin Rose shot a blistering bogey-free 63, earning himself a share of Furyk\u2019s lead at the 54-hole mark. Which is not exactly great news for Gentleman Jim: he\u2019s failed to convert any of his last nine 54-hole leads into victory. Rose is due a big one himself. The 2013 US Open champ finished this year\u2019s Masters tied for second, the Open tied for sixth, won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, and tied for fourth last week at the Quicken Loans National. He\u2019s already won a WGC title - the 2012 Cadillac Championship - and while no doubt he\u2019d prefer to lift the Wanamaker Trophy next weekend, this too would do very nicely indeed. Also hovering and very much within striking distance is Shane Lowry, who has been on the verge of a tangible breakthrough achievement for a while now. And just behind him: Steven Bowditch, Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson, Brooks Koepka, Robert Streb and Graeme McDowell. Probably just too far out of range, but you never know, are Keegan Bradley, Jason Day, Danny Lee. And an almost impossible distance away, but we\u2019ll follow their shenanigans with interest anyway, are Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Rickie Fowler and Big Dustin, who was right in the mix until shooting 75 yesterday. Ah well, Dustin is as Dustin does, and we love him to bits whatever. This will be an intriguing day in Akron. One of the game\u2019s top prizes is up for grabs, while folk are looking to get their games in order quicksmart, ahead of Glory\u2019s Last Shot next weekend at Whistling Straits. We\u2019ll get going when things really get going, at 1pm Akron time, 6pm for folks in the UK. It\u2019s on!
