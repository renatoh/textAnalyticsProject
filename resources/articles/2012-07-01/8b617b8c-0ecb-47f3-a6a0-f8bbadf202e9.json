When Bell was asked whether England were a phoney No1 he replied: \"You don't just look at the last nine Test matches, you look over the last two or three years. That's why we're ranked No1. \"The points are monitored over a long period of time. It's been a consistent effort over a long period but there's no doubt when you see how South Africa played yesterday we're going to have a real scrap on our hands.\" England must win one of the remaining two Test matches, at Headingley and Lord's, and avoid defeat in the other if they are to draw the series and retain their top-ranking status. According to Bell, the most successful of their second-innings batsmen at The Oval with a battling half-century, England will not relinquish their position without a fight. \"We're all very proud that we've got to No1 and we definitely want to stay there for a long period of time,\" he said. \"We know this defeat wasn't good enough but we must not go away thinking we have done well over a long period. We must look at certain issues that we could have done better. \"And we're confident we can get back in the series. We start on nought at Headingley, the scoreboard starts again. There's no doubt that, if we play the cricket we know we can, we can beat South Africa. If we don't, we know how good they are and they won't let us back in the game. \"Not one of us enjoyed these last five days and we want to put it right. It was thoroughly disappointing but everyone will be up for it, come next week.\" Bell said that the players have already spoken about the Oval match, where South Africa outplayed England on four of the five days. He said: \"We've had a chat. That's the one great thing about this team is we talk and there will be honesty. We're not going to say we were outplayed. We're going to discuss why. \"Andy Flower [the coach] will want everyone to scratch their minds and work out how they can improve. That's why he is such a great coach.\" Bell said that England had just played \"a real tough Test match\" against \"a quality side\". But he added: \"Opposing teams see us a bit differently now. Maybe they turn up desperately wanting to beat us because we are ranked No1 and we have to react to that. \"In a way this match has forced our hand. In the next two Tests we have to go out and fight for every single run and wicket and try to hold on to No1.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
