The disclosure of the potential value of the lawsuit will likely reignite anger among some Uber drivers who have expressed suspicion that the settlement falls short of what they are owed by the $62.5bn company. The proposed settlement, which guaranteed plaintiffs $84m but could increase to $100m based on Uber\u2019s valuation, would avert a much anticipated jury trial over the question of whether Uber drivers are rightly classified as independent contractors or employees, but only if it is approved by federal judge Edward M Chen. On Friday, judge Chen ordered Uber to reveal previously redacted information about the potential value of the lawsuit\u2019s claims, citing \u201cthe public\u2019s significant interest\u201d in information that can allow them to assess \u201cthe fairness and adequacy of the settlement\u201d. About three dozen drivers have filed official objections to the settlement with the court, expressing dissatisfaction with the monetary amount as well as with the fact that the settlement allows Uber to continue to classify drivers as independent contractors. \u201cThe recent agreed settlement of $100m ... has made an astounding amount of Uber drivers upset and oppose the measly settlement,\u201d reads one objection from former Uber driver Nick Guillermo, who goes on to call it a \u201cquick cash grab\u201d on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan. Joel Unger, an Uber driver in the San Francisco Bay Area who runs a popular forum for drivers on Facebook, called the settlement a \u201cscam of epic proportions\u201d in a message to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s almost criminal,\u201d Unger added. For her part, Liss-Riordan defends the size of the settlement. \u201cDepending on how you measure it, the recovery we obtained through this settlement is up to 29% of the actual damages we might have obtained if we had won at trial,\u201d she said Monday. The potential value of the settlement would depend on whether a jury chose to reimburse drivers based on the IRS\u2019s fixed rate (from 50 to 56.6 cents per mile) or variable rate (from 16.5 to 24 cents per mile). If the former, the total mileage damages for California and Massachusetts drivers could total $700m, while if the latter, the mileage claim would only total $277m. The filings also estimate that drivers could have won $30m in damages for unreimbursed cell phone expenses and $122m in damages for \u201cunlawful taking of gratuities\u201d. Liss-Riordan pointed out that winning in court was by no means guaranteed, especially considering that the ninth circuit court of appeals had granted Uber an appeal that likely would have delayed the trial and could have cut the size of the California class from more than 240,000 drivers to just 8,000 or fewer. In January, Uber rival Lyft reached a proposed settlement of $12.25m for a similar class action suit brought by Liss-Riordan. In April, a federal judge rejected the settlement, which he said \u201cshort-changed\u201d drivers based on estimated reimbursement damages of $126m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
