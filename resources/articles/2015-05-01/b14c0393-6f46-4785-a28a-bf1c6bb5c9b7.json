Abramovi\u0107 had complained that she reprised her performance art piece The Artist is Present for the rapper\u2019s 2013 video Picasso Baby on the condition that Jay Z would help her achieve her aim of building the institute, which will be dedicated to the study of the kind of long-duration performance art which Abramovi\u0107 has made famous. It has already been the subject of a Kickstarter fund, which quickly raised over $600,000. Abramovi\u0107 told Spike magazine that the Jay Z collaboration was a \u201cone-way transaction\u201d and that she had felt used. On Wednesday however, an art dealer and producer on the video said that Jay Z had made a large donation to the institute. Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn \u2013 the founder of minimalist gallery Salon 94 \u2013 told Artnet she had a receipt which confirmed that Jay Z had given a \u201csubstantial donation\u201d. A subsequent press release from the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute admitted it failed to inform the artist of the donation. The short statement read: \u201cMarina Abramovi\u0107 was not informed of Shawn \u2018Jay Z\u2019 Carter\u2019s donation from two years ago.\u201d It continued: \u201cWe are sincerely sorry to both Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Shawn \u201cJay Z\u201d Carter for this, and since then we have taken to [sic] appropriate actions to reconcile this matter.\u201d Jay Z has yet to comment on the saga."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
