Press Association Ketamine use triples over decade, survey suggests Use of the date rape drug ketamine has tripled among clubbers over the past 10 years, according to academics at Lancaster University. An estimated 105,000 16- to 59-year-olds are inhaling the drug, which was developed as a horse tranquiliser. Ketamine was made a class C drug two years ago. Researchers asked a sample of 400 clubbers in north-west England whether they took ketamine, and how much, in 1998. They did the same this year. They found 3% had taken the drug in 1998, compared with 9% now. The research will be published on May 16 in Addiction Research and Theory.

Press Association Violent convicts more likely to reoffend Violent and sexual reoffending has risen by 12.5% since 2000. Data from the Ministry of Justice showed that convicts released in 2005 were more likely to commit serious crimes within 12 months than before. However, adult reoffending fell by 11.4% overall in the same period, thanks to reductions in low-level crimes. David Hanson, the justice minister, admitted he was concerned by the increase in serious reoffending, but insisted it was partly caused by better reporting of sex crimes. \"There is still less than one serious offence per 100 reoffenders, and we are committed to reducing this further,\" he said.
