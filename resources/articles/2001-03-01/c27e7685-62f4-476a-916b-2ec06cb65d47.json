Members were not amused by the two billboard posters slapped on the side of the building - two 25ft x 10ft Labour posters each carrying the words \"Tory cuts\" in huge black letters. Slip of the day Defence procurement minister Lady Symons told peers that one of three contenders for a new radio contract would be chosen \"during the course of the summer\". She added: \"I hope that whoever happens to be minister at that point would then be able to conclude the contract very quickly.\" Not expecting a post-election reshuffle then? Today Commons: Backbench bills. High hedges bill, copyright, etc and trade marks (offences and enforcement) bill, pension annuities (amendment) bill, second readings. Lords: Wild mammals (protection) (amendment) bill. Debate on EU enlargement and external frontier controls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
