More than half of the anti-Brexit campaign\u2019s staff are still on strike after the its chairman, Roland Rudd, sacked its chief executive, James McGrory, and its director of communications, Tom Baldwin, over strategy. The campaign is, however, ploughing on with its attempt to influence the election by backing dozens of pro-EU MPs with thousand of pounds worth of funding. Despite its well-publicised infighting, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the last two days. The first recipient is set to be the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency following his expulsion from the Conservative party over Brexit. Others receiving cash will be candidates on the People\u2019s Vote list of 100 marginal seats where it plans to tell remain supporters to vote tactically. Opponents of the strategy say that in some of these seats the campaign has shifted away from backing Labour candidates based on polling from the Best for Britain campaign rather its own research. The campaign\u2019s official tactical voting recommendations are also due to be published this week. Patrick Heneghan, the new chief executive of the People\u2019s Vote, said the campaign would \u201cstrain every sinew to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority\u201d. \u201cWe will be encouraging voters to get out in record numbers and back the candidate in each constituency with the best chance of defeating the Conservatives provided, at minimum, they support a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who backs a second referendum, urged the campaign to act on its own data. She told the Observer: \u201cThis election, there will be a big tactical vote for Labour by those who want to stop Boris Johnson forcing his hard Brexit and a new era of austerity on our country. Liberal Democrat boasts that they can win hundreds of seats are not supported by the independent analysis done by the People\u2019s Vote campaign.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, suggested talks over a \u201cremain alliance\u201d are continuing, after a report in the Sunday Times said a pact could be formed in up to 60 constituencies Swinson said the numbers were not accurate, but the concept of an alliance still stands among parties who want to prevent Brexit. In the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection in Wales the Greens and Plaid Cymru stood down for the Lib Dem candidate, Jane Dodds, who went on to win. The area voted almost exactly 52% leave to 48% remain. The Lib Dems have already been announced that they will not field a candidate against Grieve in Beaconsfield. The party has also called for the rules on leaders\u2019 debates in elections to be written into law. This follows comments from Swinson that her exclusion from debate slots on prime time television was sexist. In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, she said: \u201cIf you look at the 2010 election and the run-up to that election, the Liberal Democrats were polling a similar amount as we are now, actually we are now much closer to the other parties in terms of the poll rating and in that election we had Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Spot the difference.\u201d Ed Davey, the Lib Dems\u2019 deputy leader, said: \u201cIt should not be in the gift of any political party to decide whether the public deserve the opportunity to scrutinise those who seek to lead this country. That is why TV debates should be mandatory, and the format should be decided by an independent commission. \u201cThe current situation in which the Labour and Conservative parties stitch up how debates work is utterly intolerable.\u201d Davey\u2019s comments come after ITV\u2019s decision that its leaders debate would be a head-to-head involving Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. The Lib Dems have 19 seats in the current parliament. Swinson said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that in the vast majority of constituencies the party of remain that is going to be best placed to win that seat would be the Liberal Democrats but it is not universally the case.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
