It may stave off insecurity in the short term, but it won't cure it.\" Another gem from \"Alain de Botton, author of Status Anxiety and the forthcoming The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work\". He said: Twitter represents \"a way of making sure you are permanently connected to somebody and somebody is permanently connected to you, proving that you are alive. It's like when a parent goes into a child's room to check the child is still breathing. It is a giant baby monitor.\" But the third of the three wise monkeys was the best by far: The clinical psychologist Oliver James has his reservations. \"Twittering stems from a lack of identity. It's a constant update of who you are, what you are, where you are. Nobody would Twitter if they had a strong sense of identity.\" Of course, this is the kind of nonsense you expect to greet new technologies, and you could say much the same things about telegraphy, telephony, pagers, television, the internet, instant messaging, blogging, MySpace/Facebook and so on. Or, indeed, you could say exactly the same things about newspapers, which Twitter user Kevin Marks* promptly did. In A load of Thunderer, he recasts the text to turn tosh about Twitter into tosh about the Sunday Times. For example: The clinical psychologist Oliver James has his reservations. \"Being quoted in the Times stems from a lack of identity. It's a constant update of who you are, what you are, where you are. Nobody would talk to them if they had a strong sense of identity.\" Still, not knocking the Style magazine: I rely on it for all my health, beauty and fashion tips, and the superb Mrs Mills Solves all Your Problems. * A Cambridge graduate, formerly of Apple and Technorati, now at Google."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
