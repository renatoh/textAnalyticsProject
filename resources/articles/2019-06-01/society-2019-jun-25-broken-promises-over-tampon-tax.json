Here in the UK, books and tampons are also joining forces. Ranjit Kaur, author of the recently published The Dancing Maharani and Other Stories, is supporting our tampon tax campaign by donating a share of the profits from the book to the campaign. As your article rightly notes, we at WRC have expressed our dismay that the then chancellor\u2019s promise \u2013 to fund women\u2019s health and support charities with monies raised from this tax \u2013 has been broken. We estimate that the debt of the tampon tax is well over \u00a3700m and we are building a campaign to get at least \u00a3500m of this ringfenced for women\u2019s specialist charities, and hold the government to account on its promise. In its media campaign, the Inland Revenue claims that \u201ctax shouldn\u2019t be taxing\u201d. Equally, tampons shouldn\u2019t be taxed. However, they are and that money should go to women\u2019s charities. Period.
