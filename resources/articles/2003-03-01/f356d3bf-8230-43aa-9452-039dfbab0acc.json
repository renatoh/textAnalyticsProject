We have to consider all the different groups of people who use the park. There are horse riders, walkers, cyclists and people who shouldn't be using the park on motorcycles. It is a challenge to try and find out how to meet everbody's needs in a narrow river valley. Walkers want to use the paths which are not suitable for horse riders who still want to ride down there. They don't like it when we start putting up fences and we have to be very diplomatic. We also really need local people to help improve the park and to encourage local groups to have some responsibility for it. It is a challenge which is interesting, but it can also be a bit frustrating. I feel very at home here, it was very much a new job last year. It is very difficult to make a judgment about a place unless you have seen it through the seasons. I now feel much more aware of the bigger picture. Some of the barriers include the amount of money available to us, because there has not been an increase in the core budget. I do sort of think perhaps I should be doing other things but no other job offers such a variety of work and habitat management. It would be very difficult to find another job that's so varied. Obviously it would be nice to be paid more than I am here as a country park ranger but if I went into management then I would be faced with much more paperwork, which is less rewarding. Public voices: March 21 2002 Park ranger, Bolton Salary: \u00a317,000 Since last year, I have moved to a country park which is about 10 times bigger than the local park in Warrington where I used to work - it is about 750 acres in total. I am now part of a team of rangers based on the one site rather than just being in a group of one or two. I have been here since last December. It is not a particularly well paid job and I am on around the same salary now as I was in my last job in Warrington - although I am on a better scale now. There is not an awful lot of interaction with the public at the moment because it is the winter months. Hopefully, I will be able to build that up in summer when we will organise education events. A lot of the community activity is very hands on. We do meet people walking their dogs, but we don't see the same people all the time as there are so many different routes around the park. Working in a bigger team is completely different. I am now in a dry building that doesn't have rain leaking into it and it is reasonably warm. My manager is in the office across the hallway. It is a very similar job in terms of the habitat and maintenance activities - it is just everything is on a larger scale. Instead of a small brook, I have now got a huge river and three large lakes instead of two small ponds. I still regard my job as a vocation and I don't think I will ever see myself doing anything different. As my family gets larger I do not know how we will cope on this money, but at the moment I can't imagine doing anything else. I think it is a really important aspect of the job that I feel valued. This is the kind of job which is great for working with people and talking to them and getting enthusiastic about a particular subject. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Park ranger, Warrington Salary: \u00a318,000 I started off studying electronic engineering at Sheffield. But when I was at university I became involved as a conservation volunteer and I have just gone on from there. My interest in the outdoors started off as a hobby. I then spent six months with the National Trust as part of their warden scheme and I got a temporary contract as a ranger at Walton Gardens in Warrington in 1993. I found that I really enjoyed working with people and engaging them about the outdoors. These urban parks are incredibly important and they play a part in raising awareness about wildlife and the environment. It is not a particularly well paid job and there is not really a comparable job in the private sector. We have a lot of responsibility in terms of taking school groups out, leading volunteers on practical projects and helping to manage the park. We wear a lot of different hats in this job, from traditional park keeper to community worker, wildlife expert to a certain degree, and providing a customer service. The work changes focus in summer when it has a reactive element - we are often working to stop people misusing parks and organising a lot of events. In winter we are more involved in habitat management and working with community groups to plant trees and coppice areas of woodland. I regard the job as a vocation. If I did it for the money I would earn a lot more working elsewhere in electronics. But there are very few jobs where you can choose what you do on a day to day basis. One day I could be like a Blue Peter presenter enthusing about things to kids and the next day I could be organising an event for 2,000 people. The fact that we are valued by the public makes the job worthwhile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
