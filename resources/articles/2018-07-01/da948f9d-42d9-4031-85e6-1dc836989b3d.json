United Voice has filed a complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman requesting the watchdog investigate the company that owns Fitzroy\u2019s Ichi Ni Nana over claims casual staff were paid just $18 an hour. Workers say they should have been paid $24.41 an hour, which was then the award rate for a casual level-two hospitality worker. It is also alleged that Asian migrant workers routinely received lower wages than their Australian and European counterparts. The underpayment claims centre around Ichi Group\u2019s 127 Brunswick Street complex, opened by well-known Melbourne restaurateurs Paul Adamo and Vince Sofo in late 2015. The venue includes the south-east Asian-inspired Village People Hawker Food Hall and Upside Rooftop Bar, as well as the Japanese eatery Ichi Ni Nana. Workers are alleged to have been underpaid at all three venues. Ichi Group, which did not respond to repeated calls, texts and emails from Guardian Australia, also runs St Kilda\u2019s Ichi Ni and Ichi Ichi Ku in South Yarra. Similar allegations were recently levelled at a series of popular Melbourne cafes, and the high-end restaurants Vue De Monde and Rockpool, which have denied the claims. James Lea, who worked as a casual \u201crunner\u201d and bar supervisor across all three venues between March 2016 and mid-2017, said a group of 20 workers confronted the company last year over their pay and conditions. Lea, who essentially served as a union organiser for the group and is now a co-founder of the new digital union Hospo Voice, said the company refused to deal with the group collectively or provide all the documentation requested, citing confidentiality. But it agreed to backpay Lea more than $13,000, conceding he had been underpaid, emails seen by Guardian Australia show. Ichi Group had initially offered about half that but Lea successfully contested the figure. United Voice, which wants the ombudsman to audit past and current pay arrangements, estimates the company has now paid back at least $150,000 to the 20 workers, with individual repayments of up to about $25,000. Lea said he was paid a flat rate of $18.50 an hour, initially in cash, before he was placed on the books at his request after six months. He was not paid penalty rates and did not receive a loading for late-night shifts. While Lea\u2019s pay was eventually bumped to $24 an hour, which is less than the appropriate award rate, he still did not receive penalty rates or other loadings. The company asked Lea to sign a settlement that included a confidentiality clause. He refused, but the money owed was paid to him anyway. Another former worker who left the company within the past few months said they had been paid $18 an hour, often cash-in-hand, while employed as a casual, and did not receive penalty rates. \u201cWhen I worked there it was such a good team. Everybody worked really hard for the company,\u201d said the worker, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity due to concerns speaking out could threaten their visa status. \u201c[But] the company, they don\u2019t appreciate the people who work for them. They tried to make it a big family, that\u2019s what the owners tell us ... but they are not really taking care of the staff.\u201d The person, who is of an Asian background, said they and their colleagues on overseas visas were paid less than those from an Australian or European background on average. \u201cAnother fact in hospitality in Melbourne is that in Asian restaurants, it could be even worse. In Asian restaurants, you get paid $15, or even less per hour. [So] when you come to a place where they pay you, not really properly, but 18 or 20 [dollars an hour], you might think it\u2019s better,\u201d they said. Another former senior employee, also on a visa, told Guardian Australia they were paid to work 38.5 hours a week but required to work 50 hours under a verbal agreement. They were also not paid penalty rates for weekend or public holiday work. The person, who worked at the restaurant for more than a year and plans to pursue backpay, estimated they were owed tens of thousands of dollars. The Victorian secretary of United Voice, Jess Walsh, said the case showed many venues in Melbourne relied on an \u201cunderclass of exploited migrant workers\u201d. \u201cEveryone we\u2019ve spoken to at Ichi Group venues was being ripped off,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what was even more alarming was the widespread exploitation of workers on temporary visas who were paid as little as $18 per hour, with no penalty rates.\u201d The Hospo Voice union planned to protest outside 127 Brunswick Street on Friday afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
