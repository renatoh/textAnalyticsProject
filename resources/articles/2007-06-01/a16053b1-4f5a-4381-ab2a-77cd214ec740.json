Now they must excite", "bodyText": "There was something stunned about Gordon Brown's expression as he stood on the threshold of No 10. He looked genuinely awestruck, as if the hugeness of the weight that had just fallen on his shoulders had taken him by surprise. All those years of waiting seemed not to have prepared him quite for the shock of power. Maybe he suddenly remembered the old warning: \"Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.\" As he turned to enter the door at last, it was plain there would be no great celebrations. The members of yesterday's new cabinet were down to work within an hour or so of their appointment. Straight to work: in every department there is heavy lifting to be done. Cabinet making is necessarily ruthless. Though Brown avoided public humiliations, nine ministers were knifed to make way for fresh blood. But the balance is good between young and experienced, Blairite and Brownite. It's a great disappointment that his cabinet includes three fewer women. Though perhaps Harriet Harman as leader of the house and minister for women will make up for numbers. No doubt there will be a gratifying bounce in the polls to cheer Labour's grassroots. No doubt the enemy press will grant a brief honeymoon. David Cameron's discomfort will deepen amid a flurry of popular announcements. Brown will chart a new course and present a government speaking in a less strident voice. Today promises refreshing new faces in junior ranks. All this should summon back angry defectors fled to Lib Dems or limbo. These things have been a long time in the planning. But for all the good mood music, most departments face formidable challenges. One sharp turn in policy direction, and the most urgent, is likely to be under David Miliband as meteoric young foreign secretary, with former UN man Mark Malloch Brown as a Foreign Office minister, Douglas Alexander at International Development and an invitation to Shirley Williams to take some role in nuclear non-proliferation. These are all anti-Iraq war people, and Washington will not be amused. Miliband's elegant description of the Foreign Office as a \"unique global asset\" reminds us how much war damage needs to be repaired to make that true. But these are ministers who can be trusted not to take us to war, not to rattle out war on terror nonsense, nor to strut and posture in Blairite messianic mode. Three more British soldiers killed and another severely injured on his first new dawn was a brutal reminder of the daily disaster Brown inherits. Every week at prime minister's questions he too will have to honour a roll-call of dead soldiers. Getting out soon without too obviously scuttling will be a hard task. And there is no escaping a long and perilous future in Afghanistan for maybe years ahead, a war that would have been well over by now but for the diversion to Iraq. The truth is, as ministers move into their new desks, that most inherit deep and difficult problems. They have only two years, maximum, to persuade voters that this is indeed a good government that has delivered on enough of its own often visionary promises. At home, the NHS is top of the emergency list. Emollient Alan Johnson now inherits health from the hapless Patricia Hewitt just as the corner may have been turned - NHS opinion polls are already rising. She is one of many casualties that litter the stage in politics who perform herculean tasks very well but never get the credit. She inherited from Alan Milburn and John Reid the expensive car crash of GP and consultants' contracts and a chaotically under-prepared purchaser-provider market. No one had done the sums. Debts suddenly skyrocketed and some 60 threatened hospital closures sprang on to the front pages of local newspapers in marginal seats everywhere. Squeezing the debt hurt, nurses barracked her, she was tormented for her voice and manner - but insiders at the DTI and health rate her as one of the most intelligent and competent of ministers. Yet presentation is the other half of politics, and the sketchwriters were as merciless as the doctors. So lucky Johnson inherits no debts but an urgent need to do what he does best - appease the turbulent 1.3 million staff currently bad-mouthing the NHS to all and sundry. Next, good news that Ed Balls takes over as the new children, schools and families secretary. The man a heartbeat from the prime minister has the task closest to the PM's heart. Schools and academies will require less attention than the still half-realised potential of the desperately underfunded Sure Start programme for under-fives. The extended schools programme has hardly begun, yet it is supposed to give every child individually from breakfast to tea whatever extra help they need, with the same music, drama, sport and fun that private schools can offer. Clever to put responsibility for Asbos here, as part of care, not punishment: watch that space. In this department is invested Brown's great social justice mission, his abolition of child poverty, his kickstarting of social mobility, his devising of life chances for all. Here, in his own final job appraisal, is where he will fail or succeed. But consider the rest. Hilary Benn on climate change, Jack Straw with the constitution, Lords and human rights, Ruth Kelly at transport, Peter Hain with rising unemployment, lost 16-year-olds and forgotten incapacity claimants. Headway must be made soon on all of these. Storm clouds gather - and not just the global warming-induced northern floods. Year-on-year house prices leapt 11% last month, interest rates are set to rise again, and maybe again after that. There are enough warnings of overexuberant debt bubbles bursting in the US and here to send shudders down many economic commentators' spines. The comprehensive spending review in October needs to magic up far more money than anyone can see yet in the Treasury coffers. Other fears: if the third interrogation of Blair over cash for honours leads to prosecution, that raises the risk of damaging the new government too. Labour needs cash fast, but how is it to be raised respectably? The Tories will twist the knife over a Scottish PM, chancellor and two others in the cabinet making English laws. They will clamour for a euro referendum - though letting loose the Redwoods may rebound. All that lays out a deliberately downbeat assessment of the hard tasks ahead of Brown if he is to win the next election. A second honeymoon for a long-in-the tooth Labour government can't be expected to last long. Don't imagine Cameron's slight setback will last either. He'll be back. So keeping hyperbole at bay would be a wise game for now, until these problems are under control. But then, as they stepped into No 10 yesterday, here was as decent and clever a team of ministers as ever graced the cabinet table. Two Milibands, Ed Balls, Jackie Smith, Harriet Harman, Alan Johnson, Douglas Alexander, Peter Hain and Hilary Benn - with the likes of John Denham and Yvette Cooper in attendance - present a good front. It's certainly the most genuinely united government in living memory. Now they have to show they can seize the public's imagination too. Wholesome competence is not enough: the public is easily bored and politics abhors an ideological vacuum. So besides the organic bread, give us some political circuses too. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
