She has three children, and she looks like any ad-man's dream of an all-American mom. However, the truth is more complicated than that: Shana is facing a year in a New York State jail, for involvement in a pyramid money-making scheme called Women Empowering Women. The get-rich-quick scheme, highlighted in Jobs &amp; Money two weeks ago, has taken Britain by storm in the past few months. In this country there are no laws to stop it and other similar \"gifting circles\" from running wild. But most American states forbid such schemes, and after Shana wrote a letter supporting the Women Empowering Women scheme to her local newspaper in Chenango County, the District Attorney decided to prosecute her. I was in Chenango County to interview Shana for Radio 4's Inside Money programme, investigating the phenomenon of pyramid fever. She is the first person to be charged with taking part in and promoting Women Empowering Women in New York State, and has pleaded not guilty. The scheme works like this: women invest $5,000 in the hopes of getting $40,000 back. In Britain, the stake is \u00a33,000, and the expected return is \u00a324,000. Like all pyramid schemes, it works only if enough new recruits join the ever-growing pyramid structure. Those who come in at the tail-end lose their money, because there aren't enough new people joining and the pyramid collapses. Women Empowering Women is especially seductive, exhorting women to support each other financially and emotionally, and boasts it is creating \"a new economic experience\". Shana doesn't believe it should be illegal. She told me: \"This isn't a gambling ring, it's not an investment ring.\" She said many needy women have been helped by \"gifts\" of money from women in the scheme. \"I personally felt it was a wonderful thing, helping single mothers who can't pay bills, and women with breast cancer,\" said Shana. She argued that she works a 50-hour week and should be able to spend her hard-earned wages as she likes. The view from the District Attorney's office is very different. Joseph McBride, a soft-spoken man, is passionate about this issue. He told me the pyramid scheme is a cancer in the community, and it is ruining lives because so many people have lost money. He said participants have lost their perspective and their judgment. \"In our county and our town,\" he argued, \"they are acting like cult members, you cannot reason with them.\" He has even re-christened the scheme Women Exploiting Women. It came as a big surprise to him that the UK had no laws to stop such schemes. And it seems the prosecution has had a deterrent effect; even Shana Jaycox admits it has frozen the progress of WEW in Chenango County. But Mr McBride is worried about the growth of other, smaller pyramid schemes in the US which are replacing it. And these smaller schemes are also taking hold here in the UK. \u0095 Lesley Curwen is presenter of BBC Radio 4's Inside Money, whose report on The Curse of the Pyramid is being broadcast at midday today, repeated on Monday July 23 at 3pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
