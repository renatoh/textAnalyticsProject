Messi agreed fresh terms last week to extend his stay until 2021. A report in Spain on Tuesday claimed City tried to lure the 30-year-old with the \u20ac100m fee plus a \u20ac50m a-year salary. Guardiola, asked about the reputed offer, said: \u201cLionel Messi has signed a contract one week ago. This was never going to happen; Messi started his career there and he\u2019s going to finish it there. If he wanted to leave he wouldn\u2019t have signed the contract.\u201d Pressed that the report claimed the offer came before Messi agreed new terms, City\u2019s manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d City play Shakhtar Donetsk in Kharkiv on Wednesday night in the final Group F game already through as winners. If they win Guardiola will be the club\u2019s first manager to win all six group games. Yaya Tour\u00e9, who won the Champions League with Barcelona under Guardiola in 2009, believes City are playing the best football in the competition. \u201cWe think we practise the best football in Europe when we go forward, though we find it difficult against some opponents,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cWe need to play against a big opponent to see where we are. To repeat what I did in 2009 with a different club, in a different club, would be something special. \u201cTeams respect us more now. They feel the way we play and attack. We are in a good moment, full of confidence. If you ask all my team-mates they are all enjoying it.\u201d Guardiola, though, was less emphatic. \u201cWe are doing well but that doesn\u2019t mean you will achieve the title,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this competition one bad 45 minutes and you are out. That means you can win the title but go out if you are doing well. I\u2019m not concerned if we are playing the best football.\u201d Guardiola said David Silva may miss Sunday\u2019s derby at Manchester United. \u201cDavid had a little bit of a problem in the last minutes [against West Ham United on Sunday],\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a test after the game and I don\u2019t know if he is able to play on Sunday so that\u2019s why he stayed there, to recover in Manchester.\u201d Asked what the problem was, Guardiola laughed off the question. He confirmed Bernardo Silva would start and said City, winners of their past 20 games, would go for victory against Ukraine\u2019s champions, who are second in the group. \u201cWe play for our prestige and to keep our winning mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so happy to be in the last 16 but it will be tough. I saw them play Napoli, their midfield is good, their buildup is perfect. It is a tough game, a tough team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
