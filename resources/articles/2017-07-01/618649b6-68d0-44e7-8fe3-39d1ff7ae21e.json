But a new book reveals how the world\u2019s greatest male dancer was also capable of the most brutal and abusive behaviour, including kicking a ballerina so hard she required medical treatment and threatening another colleague with a knife. The extraordinary incidents are detailed in the forthcoming autobiography of Dame Beryl Grey, 90, the former prima ballerina who collaborated with Nureyev in the 1970s when she was artistic director of London Festival Ballet (now English National Ballet). Grey has drawn on her previously unpublished diaries, writing \u201cabout Rudi as I found him\u201d. \u201cEvery day, he was different and unpredictable, so kind sometimes, other times so uncharitable.\u201d Although his temperamental outbursts are well-recorded \u2013 he could be rude even to his dancing partner Margot Fonteyn, whom he adored \u2013 Grey is offering further insights into the dancer. In her book, For the Love of Dance, she describes his \u201cblack moods\u201d, \u201ctantrums\u201d and \u201ctruculent, offensive behaviour\u201d. \u201cAs a great artist and a fantastic producer, he was an inspiration for our dancers, but I detested his foul language, rudeness and unpredictable bad moods.\u201d She recalls a performance of Romeo and Juliet in which Nureyev \u201cattacked one of our leading ballerinas \u2026 Liliana Belfiore\u201d: \u201cHe swore at her and kicked her up the backside so hard that she left the stage in great pain. \u201cA doctor was called who, after examining her, said that her coccyx had been damaged and was bent. She was in agony and the doctor advised us that the injury might cause her to act unpredictably and temperamentally.\u201d Belfiore, \u201cin a rage\u201d, reported Nureyev to the police. Grey confronted Nureyev in his dressing room: \u201cNureyev was not apologetic. He began running down the company and saying Belfiore had displeased him. \u201cI said: \u2018That didn\u2019t give you the right to kick her.\u2019 He answered: \u2018I am the greatest dancer alive and I can do what I want.\u2019 To which I unguardedly retorted: \u2018There are other great dancers too, Rudi.\u2019 \u201cHe was furious at this and menacingly picked up a knife, but was restrained by his masseur, Luigi. On hearing raised voices, someone threw the door open and I was hustled away \u2026 with Nureyev shouting: \u2018No more performances!\u2019\u201d He later calmed down and Belfiore was persuaded not to sue him. \u201cDifficult he certainly was,\u201d Grey said. \u201cHe was so unpredictable, so arrogant \u2026 One minute he couldn\u2019t be nicer and kinder to everyone, delightful with me. Then, within a second, he could change completely. He\u2019d shout and stamp.\u201d Nureyev, who died in 1993 aged 54, was one of the greatest and most charismatic artists of the 20th century. He created Romeo and Juliet for her company: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the best Romeo and Juliet there is \u2026 It wasn\u2019t like any other ballet.\u201d His talent, along with \u201chis charm and many kindnesses\u201d, made his behaviour all the more difficult to understand, she said. \u201cOf all the great people I\u2019ve known, he\u2019s the only one to behave like that. They\u2019re usually very modest, because they realise it\u2019s a God-given talent. He was very arrogant.\u201d She recalls Nureyev being \u201cextremely insulting\u201d to one of her dancers and descending into \u201cone of his black moods\u201d with another. On one occasion, he was so angry he picked up his Thermos flask and hurled it across the room. But she said: \u201cOnce he was on the stage, this mesmerising personality just fixed one \u2026 It was so sad that, in his latter years, all he wanted to do was dance. He would force himself all bound up, his feet, his calves, his knees, and his masseur would be waiting for him. I said to him once: \u2018You\u2019re a fantastic producer, you\u2019re a choreographer, why must you force yourself to dance?\u2019 He said: \u2018I have to dance, I need the public.\u2019 He just wanted the public acclaim. Almost in a funny way, he needed reassurance. He was a very strange person.\u201d Grey began her dancing career with Sadler\u2019s Wells Ballet, soon taking on leading roles. In the late 1950s, she left the Royal Ballet to pursue a glittering freelance career, becoming the first English dancer to appear as a ballerina at the Bolshoi and the Kirov. She never danced with Nureyev, though: \u201cI would have been too tall. But I would have been very scared to have danced with him because you didn\u2019t know if he was going to be in a good mood or a bad one.\u201d For the Love of Dance is published by Oberon Books on 17 July. English National Ballet will perform Nureyev\u2019s Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Festival Hall, 1-5 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
