The four-year freeze on local housing allowance levels, which has been in place since April 2016, means some families must meet a shortfall of hundreds of pounds a month on their rent support, according to the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH). It said the ongoing housing benefit freeze meant even the lowest private rents were out of reach for many low-income families in most areas \u2013 making it more likely that tenants would be forced to choose between living necessities or paying the rent. \u201cOur research makes it clear just how far housing benefit for private renters has failed to keep pace with even the cheapest private rents. We fear this policy is putting thousands of private renters on low incomes at risk of poverty and homelessness,\u201d said the CIH\u2019s chief executive, Terrie Alafat. The biggest \u201crent gaps\u201d \u2013 the difference between rent and housing support levels in the cheapest third of rented properties in a local housing market area \u2013 were in London, where the median shortfall was \u00a366 a week for a four-bedroom property and \u00a343 for a two-bedroom, although this masked larger gaps of more than \u00a3140 a week in the inner city \u2013 adding up to more than \u00a3600 a month. The problem was noticeable in locations near the capital that have been popular with commuters, such as Cambridge, Milton Keynes and Chelmsford, where the weekly shortfalls on a four-bed property were \u00a368, \u00a362 and \u00a359 respectively. There were striking shortfalls in areas such as Greater Glasgow (\u00a382 a week on a four-bedroom home), Bristol (\u00a371) and southern Greater Manchester (\u00a353). The median national weekly rent gap on a four-bedroom home was \u00a317. In a handful of areas, including Liverpool and Leeds, there was no rent gap for this size of property. The weekly shortfall on two-bedroom private rented homes has followed a broadly similar pattern \u2013 highest in London, with significant gaps in places such as Bristol (\u00a340), south-west Hertfordshire (\u00a339) and Bath (\u00a334). The median national weekly rent gap on this size of property was \u00a38, according to the research. The CIH said that although ministers introduced a \u201ctargeted affordability fund\u201d in 2014 to bridge the biggest gaps, the impact of this had been negligible because it had failed to meaningfully shrink the shortfall in the worst-hit areas. The CIH called on the government to end the freeze on benefits. It estimated that the cost of realigning local housing allowance \u2013 which has lagged behind rent increases in many areas since 2013 \u2013 would be \u00a31.2bn. Matt Downie, the director of policy at the housing charity Crisis, said: \u201cThis report highlights just how much housing benefits for private renters are falling short of the levels needed, leaving many homeless people stuck in a desperate situation and putting yet more people at risk of homelessness.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe spend \u00a324bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we\u2019ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates. \u201cSince 2011, we have provided a further \u00a31bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs. \u201cWe have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further \u00a39bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
