As a native of the area, I can confidently say that three days at Niagara Falls is 2 days too many, but there is more than enough in the surrounding area for a great trip. The falls are awesome, but how long can you look at a bunch of moving water? The highlight of your visit will probably be a trip on the Maid of the Mist tour boat, which takes you near the base of the falls. A visit to the state park on the American side is worthwhile, although the best views are on the Canadian side. Avoid both the American and Canadian cities of Niagara Falls - both are full of tacky tourist trash. Instead, if your legs are up to it, take a hike down into the Niagara Gorge at Devils Hole State Park, to see the whirlpools and rapids in a more natural setting. So what do you do with the rest of your time? Visit Niagara on the Lake for some quaint dining and shopping, and the city of Buffalo, New York, has some outstanding buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan, along with a magnificent art deco city hall. Any trip to the falls should also include the city of Toronto, for great shopping, dining and nightlife. Brian Szpakowski Denis McCarthy wants to find a good cup of tea in Stockholm. Swedish people generally prefer coffee, but there are some of us who love tea. Here is where you can enjoy a good cup: \u00b7 Bl\u00e5 Porten, next to Liljevalchs gallery and not far from Vasa museum. \u00b7 Rosendals V\u00e4rdshus (in a lovely garden), on the same island as Bl\u00e5 Porten; take bus 47. \u00b7 Babajan, also on the same island; take bus 69. \u00b7 Lasse I Parken,H\u00f6galidsgatan 56; take a red metro to Hornstull. \u00b7 Galleri Caf\u00e9 Lucas,Blecktornsgr\u00e4nd; metro to Slussen. Maria The Tea Centre of Stockholm (teacentre.se) in Sodermalm at Hornsgatan 46, creates its own blends, including the lovely S\u00f6derblandning, which is sold in a number of cafes. One of the best places to drink tea is the antique tram No 7 Rullande (rolling) Cafe which runs from the town centre to the parks and museums in Djurg\u00e5rden. The price of the return journey includes tea, coffee or chocolate plus a cake. Claire Thirlwall The English Shop in S\u00f6derhallerna on Medborgarplatsen will sell you a box of PG Tips. They'll even provide you with chocolate biscuits. Cathy Kingsbury Lucy Chappell wants to visit the Azores. Quinta das Buganvilias (00 351 292 943 740, doubles from \u20ac66 until April 30, \u20ac82 until September 30) on Faial is in an idyllic setting out of town but close to the airport. The way of life is relaxing, eating out is good and not as expensive as we expected -below mainland prices. 'Musts' include the legendary Peter Caf\u00e9 Sport (petercafesport.com) in Horta, and whale watching with Norberto (+292 293 891, norbertodiver.com). Geoff and Jacqui Shickle Accommodation is rarely very cheap, but there is a youth hostel on S\u00e3o Miguel and camping on some islands. Pens\u00e3os or residencials are good value, such as Residencial S\u00e3o Francisco (00351 292 200 980) in Horta, Faial, which gets full in summer. There are rooms to rent on Flores. The Bradt Guide to the Azores has accommodation addresses, and the Sunflower book is excellent on walking. It is easy to travel between islands in the same group by boat (eg Faial and Pico), but flights are a better option for the longer hops. Destination Portugal (01993 773269, destination-portugal.co.uk) can arrange flights and accommodation. Liza McCarthy From April 5-October 25, SATA (+351 707 227282, sata.pt) operates a weekly direct charter Gatwick-S\u00e3o Miguel. TAP (0845 6010932, tap-airportugal.pt) flies Gatwick-Faial via Lisbon 3/4 daysa week. Sunvil (020-8758 4758, sunvil.co.uk) has packages including walking, cycling and whale watching in S\u00e3o Miguel, Santa Maria, S\u00e3o Jorge, Faisal, Pico, Terceira, Graciosa and Flores. \u00b7 If you have advice or questions, please email: ask.a.fellow.traveller@theguardian.com, or write to: Ask a fellow traveller, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
