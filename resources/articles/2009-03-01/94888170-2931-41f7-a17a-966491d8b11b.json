The bank's annual report today revealed the famously gym-sculpted American has suffered a brutal \u00a34m cut to his annual remuneration \u2013 leaving him last year with a meagre \u00a317m in cash and shares. Yesterday, Barclays maintained Diamond's pay was cut to a decidedly modest basic salary of \u00a3250,000. But a closer reading of the bank's report revealed his total take-home pay last year was bolstered by payments from share and bonus schemes he had achieved. None of this was clawed back, despite Barclays' promise to withdraw bonuses for top executives as part of its attempt to appease investors furious about the expensive funds it was forced to raise from the Middle East in October. Diamond was handed \u00a37.4m in cash from a three-year performance scheme he achieved in 2007 and received a further \u00a39.7m in shares when a previous performance scheme paid out, according to last year's annual report, which was published today. Barclays has so far resisted taking any taxpayers' money \u2013 unlike RBS and Lloyds \u2013 and has yet to decide whether to take part in the government's insurance scheme for toxic assets. Diamond, who led the purchase of the Wall Street operations of the collapsed Lehman Brothers last year, was given a special scheme to link his pay to his performance at Barclays Capital after he joined the main board of the bank three years ago. The pay deal had been included in the 2007 annual report. Those envious of Diamond's relative good fortune in a year that saw the world of finance brought to its knees might draw some comfort from the impact the slump in the bank's share price has had on his worth. The \u00a39.7m shares he received last year have already fallen in value to \u00a32.5m. The annual report also shows that Diamond had \u00a350m of shares at the start of 2008, which had been wiped out by the end of last year because of the slide in the share price. Diamond has handed out bonuses worth \u00a3600m to the investment banking staff of Barclays Capital and has defended the decision by avoiding the word bonus. \"I would prefer the phrase incentive compensation,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
