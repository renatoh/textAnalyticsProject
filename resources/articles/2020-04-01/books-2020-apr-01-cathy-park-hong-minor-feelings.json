For instance, my friend is worried for his kids. He lives in New York City, and he has a son in school who has been bullied and made fun of for having the coronavirus. There\u2019s this yellow peril stereotype that never goes away.\u201d Minor Feelings, Hong\u2019s collection of essays, explores how society\u2019s perception of Asian American identity shapes the experience of being an Asian American. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hong was reminded almost daily that how white America viewed her community clashed with her own experiences. For instance, she writes: \u201cYou are told, \u2018Asian Americans are so successful,\u2019 while you feel like a failure.\u201d \u201cMinor feelings\u201d are defined in the book as the feelings that arise \u201cfor instance, upon hearing a slight, knowing it\u2019s racial, and being told, Oh, that\u2019s all in your head\u201d. Hong explains: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I would see my mother clearly being condescended to by white adults, by white women especially ... they would dumb down their words.\u201d She points out that there has been \u201cno critical vocabulary for this dominant culture that was constantly gaslighting my lived experience. Because my experience wasn\u2019t being acknowledged, I had these feelings of shame, suspicion, melancholy, and paranoia.\u201d Asian Americans are often stereotyped as successful, model-minority immigrants. At the same time, they are also often excluded from discussions of US culture. Hong points to the recent primary elections: \u201cAsians are hyper invisible. We\u2019re not even included in racial breakdowns in polls. We\u2019re always listed as \u2018other\u2019, if we\u2019re listed at all. For example, with Super Tuesday, there was so much news about the black southern vote, the Latinx vote, the white rural vote, the white urban vote, the white college-educated vote, but nothing on Asian Americans ... Did they vote for Bernie or Biden? We\u2019re not statistically visible.\u201d Hong sighs. \u201cIt almost feels like we\u2019re not publicly participating in this country.\u201d The racism takes many forms. She writes about how Asian American women are seen as \u201cfetish objects\u201d, while Asian American men are often considered \u201cunmasculine, untrustworthy, suspicious, and foreign\u201d. Also: \u201cChinese is synecdoche for Asians the way Kleenex is for tissues.\u201d Minor feelings are not only felt by Asian Americans, of course. Hong cites Claudia Rankine\u2019s Citizen as a book that investigates the phenomenon among African Americans, and explains how \u201cMinor Feelings explores the trauma of a racist capitalist system that keeps the individual in place. It\u2019s playing tennis \u2018while black\u2019 and dining out \u2018while black\u2019.\u201d Hong is the author of three poetry collections; Minor Feelings is her first set of essays. It took shape, she says, from watching the comedy films of Richard Pryor while experiencing a period of depression. \u201cIt was revelatory. The way he talked about race was so brutally honest and funny and unvarnished. It made me think that I had never encountered Asian identity being written in that way.\u201d Watching Pryor also reminded Hong of the Korean term han, \u201cwhich is a collective national Korean emotion of affects that includes bitterness, melancholy, nostalgia, and resentment, that\u2019s rooted in the trauma of war, colonialism, and now, late capitalism\u201d. Hong realised that han \u201cisn\u2019t isolated to South Korea \u2026 There\u2019s this specific combination of feelings when you can\u2019t overcome the structural inequities you\u2019re living under.\u201d As a daughter of immigrants in Los Angeles, Hong says she \u201cwas alienated in the way that a lot of Asian kids are alienated\u201d. Though born in Koreatown, her family moved to the Westside in her early childhood, with her father eventually buoying them to a level of success that allowed Hong to attend private high school and college at Oberlin in Ohio. \u201cOn paper,\u201d she writes, \u201cmy father is the so-called model immigrant.\u201d Behind closed doors, however, the family had to contend with his anger and heavy drinking. Hong says: \u201cFor my family, there\u2019s still this anxiety to assimilate. That\u2019s also a survival tactic, to look ahead and not look back, and to be, if not white, then white-adjacent, which is destructive.\u201d The dissonance between her life at home and the perceptions put on her by the outside world, led Hong to art and writing in her teenage years. Oberlin was where she began to embrace the \u201cbad\u201d English of her childhood. \u201cMy teacher said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to be ashamed of the broken English you grew up speaking. You can use that as a strength in your writing.\u2019 That really stuck with me.\u201d Hong\u2019s essay \u201cBad English\u201d details her evolving relationship with language. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best benefits of growing up bilingual, right?\u201d she says. \u201cYou realise that meaning is slippery.\u201d Minor Feelings \u201cstarted out as poetry, then fiction, and then it became this collection ,\u201d she says, and points to the subtitle of her book: An Asian American Reckoning. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Asian American reckoning.\u201d Hong wants to overthrow the monolithic story of one Asian American identity. \u201cMaybe what I\u2019m responding to is how white America has flattened our experience to a single story, how they perceive us as one kind. The book is an attempt to overthrow that.\u201d Hong is careful to emphasise that she is exploring race through her specific life experiences. \u201cThere\u2019s this fear of exposure, of presenting the right narrative that will put your family on a pedestal rather than knocking them down. I felt that greatly.\u201d She knew, though, that she needed to embrace vulnerability. \u201cI wanted the book to be as persuasive as possible, and in order to be so, it had to reach the reader\u2019s heart, not just their mind.\u201d Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong is published by Profile.
