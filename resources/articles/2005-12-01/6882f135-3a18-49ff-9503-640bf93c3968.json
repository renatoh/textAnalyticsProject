Because she lives a completely selfish lifestyle and lives recklessly in the pursuit of hedonistic pleasures? Because if she were a man people might look at it differently? How about, instead of saying \"oh, good for you Kate - you too can be a money-grubbing, selfish, irresponsible, antisocial 'success' just like a man\", we look at why we think it's OK for so many men to get away with this kind of behaviour. Being able to be equally antisocial to men is not progress. Maria Blum Birmingham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
