You can see the full list of bands here. In addition to previously revealed sets by Arcade Fire and Pixies, the Spanish festival will host headliners such as Queens of the Stone Age, the National and Kendrick Lamar. A little lower on the bill, the three-day bash ranges from Disclosure to Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Haim to Kronos Quartet, plus Metronomy, Foals, SBTRKT, Chrvches and Mick Harvey's take on the songs of Serge Gainsbourg. As the shoegaze legends Slowdive head to Barcelona for their first concert in 20 years, legacy acts such as Neutral Milk Hotel, Slint, Linda Perhacs, Dismemberment Plan, Shellac and Television are using Primavera to continue their comebacks. Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo and Kim Gordon are both appearing with their new projects, Lee Ranaldo and the Dust and Body/Head, Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna is bringing Julie Ruin, and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon will perform with his side-project Volcano Choir. Even the Sun Ra Arkestra are scheduled to appear. While Primavera fills Barcelona's Parc del F\u00f2rum from 29 to 31 May, festival organisers are also staging club concerts throughout the week. These smaller gigs include shows by Juana Molina, the Ex, Antibalas and Angel Olsen. On 28 May, Primavera opens up its site for a free show featuring Sky Ferreira, Temples and Holy Ghost. Tickets for Primavera are now on sale at an early-bird price of 175\u20ac. The line-up for the Portuguese edition of the festival, which takes place a week later in Porto, will be unveiled on 7 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
