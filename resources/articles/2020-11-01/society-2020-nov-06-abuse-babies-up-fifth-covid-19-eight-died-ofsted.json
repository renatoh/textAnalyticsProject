More than 300 \u201cserious incident notifications\u201d of injury and death involving children were reported by local authorities between April and October, of which almost 40% involved children under the age of one. According to Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, more than half of those babies \u2013 64 in total \u2013 suffered non-accidental injuries. \u201cAnd sadly, eight died as a result,\u201d she said. The figures confirm fears among those working in children\u2019s services about the impact of lockdown and the continuing Covid pandemic on vulnerable children, particularly babies, growing up in the most troubled families. In a speech to the National Children and Adults Services conference on Friday, Spielman will say violence towards babies is not new, with more than a quarter of incidents reported to the child safeguarding practice review panel last year arising out of non-accidental injuries. But she describes the additional strain on vulnerable families during lockdown as a \u201cCovid pressure cooker\u201d that has created additional risk for the youngest and most vulnerable children. \u201cTighter restrictions have brought increased tensions for many, especially in the most troubled families,\u201d Spielman will say. \u201cWe\u2019re all spending more time at home these days. For most children, that\u2019s a place of comfort at best, boredom at worst. But for some, sadly, it\u2019s a source of danger.\u201d She said families that were already struggling with poverty, poor housing and mental ill health were facing a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of additional pressures including financial hardship, loss of employment, isolation and close family proximity. Ofsted also reported a high number of unexpected infant deaths, which it called \u201cpreventable tragedies\u201d, including cases where babies died after sharing a bed or sofa with a parent who had been drinking. Spielman will urge all professionals dealing with children \u2013 including midwives, health visitors and GPs, as well as staff working in schools and nurseries \u2013 to work together to identify and protect vulnerable children as the second lockdown gets under way. \u201cOf course, babies can\u2019t tell an adult if there\u2019s a problem. Often, abuse is only uncovered when there\u2019s a critical injury, or it\u2019s too late,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother young life damaged, and in the worst cases, lost, before it\u2019s really had chance to begin \u2026 It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. But we must all be alive to this hidden danger. As ever, we cannot overstate the importance of curiosity here. It may not always be comfortable territory. But the right questions protect children.\u201d The latest restrictions could hamper face-to-face visits, she will say. \u201cBut while these children are out of sight, they should never be out of mind.\u201d Local authorities are required to report any serious incidents where a child dies or is harmed through abuse or neglect to the child safeguarding practice review panel, which alerts Ofsted and the Department for Education. Child protection referrals dropped by more than half in some areas of England over the first lockdown period, when schools were closed to all but the most vulnerable and children of key workers, and families were asked to stay at home. With schools remaining open during England\u2019s latest month-long lockdown, children\u2019s services say vulnerable children will be more visible and professionals will be able to report any concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
