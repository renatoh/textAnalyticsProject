However the broadcaster claims Jennings' promoter, Frank Warren, is to blame. A spokesperson said today: \"We would love to show it but Frank Warren holds the UK rights and, so far, has refused to sell them to either us or Sky. We are working on it and perhaps by tomorrow night we might have a deal.\" Warren, who has an unrelated legal wrangle with the station, denied he is holding up negotiations. \"I would love Michael's fans to see the fight,\" he said. \"He is a lovely guy and I really hope he can do it. In fact, I think he has a fair shout of winning, as Cotto tires in the second half of a fight. If Michael can get past five or six rounds, he might pull off one of the great upsets. It is not me who is stopping it. I want to do a deal.\" So does most of Chorley, but Jennings' fans are livid they might not be able to watch the fight live \u2013 and they are not bothered who is responsible. Since December, when the troubled sports channel announced it had secured a three-year agreement with Top Rank to show major fights from the US and Europe, Jennings's fans have been encouraged to believe that his fight would be a part of that package. Setanta Sports' Sean O'Hara commented at the time: \"This is another fantastic deal for Setanta and proves that we really are 'the home of boxing'. We are committed to bringing the best fights to our subscribers and by signing this three-year deal with Top Rank, viewers will be treated to world-class bouts involving Manny Pacquiao, Antonio Margarito and Miguel Cotto amongst others.\" The broadcaster has been advertising its live coverage of the fight for several weeks. However, Setanta, under pressure commercially as it struggles with a reduced football portfolio, had to admit on its own website this week: \"The Cotto-Jennings fight is not confirmed as being shown on Setanta this weekend.\" The bout is part of a pay-per-view Top Rank double-bill in two US cities, alongside Kelly Pavlik's middleweight title fight against Marco Antonio Rubio in Youngstown, Ohio, on the same evening. If negotiations are unsuccessful, it will be a huge disappointment to the 31-year-old Lancashire boxer, who has come from relative obscurity to fight a renowned opponent on a stage that is still regarded as the sport's spiritual home of boxing. While two hundred fans have gone with him to New York, many thousands more were expecting to watch him live ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
