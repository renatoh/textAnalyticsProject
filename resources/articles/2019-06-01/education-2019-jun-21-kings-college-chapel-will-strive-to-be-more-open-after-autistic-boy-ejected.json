Paul Rimmer, an astrochemist at the university, met Stephen Cherry, the dean of King\u2019s College, this week after posting online a blistering letter about the incident last weekend. Cherry immediately issued a public and unreserved apology. \u201cWe had a good meeting and discussions will continue on how King\u2019s College chapel might be a more welcoming and open place to all,\u201d Rimmer told the Guardian. \u201cIt was very sad and very regrettable that this happened, but I\u2019m pleased with how things are moving.\u201d Rimmer attended the evensong service on Father\u2019s Day with his two sons. Tristan, nine, is autistic, and was described in Rimmer\u2019s letter as \u201ca clever and joyful child, who loves church buildings, services and choral music. He is also non-verbal, and expresses his excitement by calling out and laughing. His expressions are often loud and uncontainable. It is part of who he is.\u201d During the service, an usher told Rimmer that the dean had instructed him to remove the family as Tristan\u2019s expressions were disrupting other visitors\u2019 enjoyment of the service. King\u2019s College and its choir are a big attraction, and the chapel is famous for its Christmas Eve carol service broadcast by the BBC. Rimmer wrote: \u201cAs a Christian I believe that worship is primarily intended to glorify God, and may have misinterpreted your evensong as an actual worship service, at which my son\u2019s expressions must surely be pleasing to God, the experience of other worshippers being secondary.\u201d He added: \u201cMight I suggest that you place a sign at the front of the chapel, clearly identifying which categories of people are welcome and which are not? I can only imagine how terrible it would be if autistic people, others with disabilities, those with mental illnesses and people with dementia were all equally welcome to attend evensong \u2013 how this would get in the way of the choir\u2019s performance, how it would distract the choristers, and how upsetting seeing these sorts of people at the chapel would be for the tourists who have come such a long way. \u201cMy son might not be able to talk but he knows perfectly well what is going on around him \u2026 He isn\u2019t even 10 years old and he knows that he is unwelcome.\u201d The academic apologised for his son\u2019s \u201cunpalatable presence\u201d and said he was making the letter public so others \u201cwill not make the same careless mistake I have\u201d. In his response, also made public, Cherry said he had been devastated to read Rimmer\u2019s letter and he said the chapel had \u201cfailed you and Tristan. I apologise for that most sincerely.\u201d The dean requested a meeting, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure that your insights and connections could help us do better in the future.\u201d He said he had not given any instruction to remove the family, but as dean \u201cI do take responsibility for the whole life of the chapel\u201d. Rimmer said Tristan had been \u201cdefinitely upset\u201d at the incident as \u201che was enjoying the experience and the music. But we went to the park and he calmed down.\u201d Similar incidents had happened a few times in cinemas and restaurants, he added. \u201cPeople can react negatively. Sometimes it\u2019s just out of ignorance. They may not be aware that Tristan is autistic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
