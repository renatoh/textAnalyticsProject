They celebrated their legislative victory and heaped praise on the president in the outdoor ceremony. After Trump inaccurately called the bill \u201cthe largest tax cut in the history of the country\u201d, and hailed it for allowing for the \u201cformation of new, young, beautiful, strong companies\u201d, Republican leaders took turns praising him. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this had been \u201ca year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration\u201d and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, praised Trump\u2019s \u201cexquisite presidential leadership\u201d. Others went even further. Vice-President Mike Pence thanked Trump for his \u201cboundless faith in the American people\u201d while Utah senator Orrin Hatch called Trump \u201cone heck of a leader\u201d. Perhaps the most fervent praise came from Tennessee congresswoman Diane Black who proclaimed: \u201cThank you, President Trump, for allowing us to have you as our president.\u201d The House passed the bill by 224 to 201\u2013 repeating the previous day\u2019s vote after making a mistake in its passage on Tuesday. Twelve Republicans voted against the plan and no Democrats supported it. The bill represents a $1.5tn tax cut which permanently slashes corporate tax rates and also lowers taxes for individuals. Trump hailed the bill in a statement. \u201cI promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting \u2026 By cutting taxes and reforming the broken system, we are now pouring rocket fuel into the engine of our economy. America is back to winning again, and we\u2019re growing like never before.\u201d In a cabinet meeting shortly before the House vote, Trump praised the legislation and hailed it as \u201cessentially repealing Obamacare\u201d in addition to what he claimed would be the economic benefits of the tax cut. \u201cIt\u2019s about jobs,\u201d insisted Trump. He also heralded a measure which would open up the Alaskan Arctic wilderness for oil and gas drilling by energy companies. Pence also spoke, praising Trump for delivering \u201chistoric tax cuts \u2026 [and] that middle-class miracle\u201d. The housing secretary, Ben Carson, also offered a prayer. \u201cWorkers benefit. Wages go up. More jobs occur,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday on NBC\u2019s Today, describing what Republicans say will flow from a $1.5tn measure that affects everyone\u2019s taxes but is dominated by breaks for business and higher earners. Democrats call the legislation a boon to the rich that leaves middle-class and working Americans behind. \u201cIf they think this bill is a good political argument for them, let them think that,\u201d the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters. The Senate used a post-midnight vote to approve the measure on a party-line 51-48 tally. Protesters interrupted with chants of, \u201cKill the bill, don\u2019t kill us\u201d and Pence, chairing the session, repeatedly called for order. Upon passage, Republicans cheered, with the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, among them. McConnell insisted Americans would respond positively to the tax bill. \u201cIf we can\u2019t sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work,\u201d he said. Trump planned a ceremony with GOP lawmakers on Wednesday at the White House after final congressional approval. The bill will not be signed there, however. Instead, it is likely to be signed by Trump while he spends Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The tax bill which was pushed through Congress at a breakneck pace required an extra day before it could reach Trump\u2019s desk because of a procedural hiccup with Senate rules. This meant the House had to vote a second time on the bill once two minor offending provisions had been stripped out. Ryan, who has worked years toward the goal of revamping the tax code, gleefully pounded the gavel on Tuesday\u2019s House vote. GOP House members roared and applauded as they passed a package that will touch every American taxpayer and every corner of the US economy, providing steep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy, and more modest help for middle- and low-income families. Despite Republican talk of spending discipline, the bill is projected to push the huge national debt ever higher. Ryan said on Wednesday the GOP was willing to risk running up deficits with the aim of getting a higher annual economic growth rate. Trump is aching for a big political victory after 11 months of legislative failures and nonstarters. The president tweeted his congratulations to GOP leaders and to \u201call great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!\u201d Congressional Republicans, who faltered badly in trying to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, see passage of the tax bill as crucial to proving to Americans they can govern \u2013 and imperative for holding on to House and Senate majorities in next year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cThe proof will be in the paychecks,\u201d Senator Rob Portman said during the Senate\u2019s nighttime debate. \u201cThis is real tax relief, and it\u2019s needed.\u201d Not so, said the top Senate Democrat as the long, late hours led to testy moments Tuesday night. \u201cWe believe you are messing up America,\u201d the New York senator Chuck Schumer told Republicans, chiding them for not listening to his remarks. The GOP has repeatedly argued the bill will spur economic growth as corporations, flush with cash, increase wages and hire more workers. But many voters in surveys see the legislation as a boost to the wealthy, such as Trump and his family, and a minor gain at best for the middle class. Democrats mocked the Republicans\u2019 contention that the bill will make taxes so simple that millions can file their returns \u201con a postcard\u201d \u2013 an idea repeated often by the president. \u201cWhat happened to the postcard? We\u2019re going to have to carry around a billboard for tax simplification,\u201d declared Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the ways and means committee. Tax cuts for corporations would be permanent while the cuts for individuals would expire in 2026 to comply with Senate budget rules. The tax cuts would take effect in January, and workers would start to see changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks in February. The bill would slash the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The top tax rate for well-off individuals would be lowered from 39.6% to 37%. The legislation repeals an important part of the 2010 healthcare law \u2013 the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance or face a penalty \u2013 as the GOP looks to unravel the law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer. It also allows oil drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge. The $1,000-per-child tax credit doubles to $2,000, with up to $1,400 available in IRS refunds for families that owe little or no taxes. Disgruntled Republican lawmakers from high-tax New York, New Jersey and California receded into the background as the tax train rolled. They oppose a new $10,000 limit on the deduction for state and local taxes. The bill is projected to add $1.46tn to the nation\u2019s debt over a decade. GOP lawmakers say they expect a future Congress to continue the tax cuts so they won\u2019t expire. That would drive up deficits even further.
