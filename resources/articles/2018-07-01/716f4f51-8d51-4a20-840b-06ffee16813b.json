Comcast\u2019s \u00a314.75p a share offer followed Murdoch\u2019s new \u00a314 a share offer valuing Sky at \u00a324.5bn. Murdoch moved to up his original bid \u2013 of \u00a310.75p a share \u2013 ahead of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, finally clearing the bid on Thursday. Murdoch is aiming to takeover the 61% of Sky he doesn\u2019t already own through 21st Century Fox, which owns assets including the Hollywood studio behind films including X-Men and Deadpool. Comcast\u2019s first \u00a312.50 a share offer, valuing Sky at \u00a322bn, resulted in Sky\u2019s independent committee recommending shareholders reject Murdoch\u2019s original \u00a310.75 deal tabled in December 2016. His new offer made on Wednesday, at \u00a314.00 a share, once again won over Sky\u2019s independent directors who recommended the new \u00a324.5bn deal. However, Comcast\u2019s new offer, more than 5% over Murdoch\u2019s latest deal, has won the recommendation of Sky\u2019s independent committee. \u201cWe are please to be announcing a recommended increased offer for Sky today,\u201d said Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast. \u201cWe have long admired Sky, which we believe is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast. We will be posting our offer document to Sky shareholders shortly.\u201d Martin Gilbert, deputy chairman of Sky, said that Comcast\u2019s offer represent an \u201cattractive premium to the current alternative offer\u201d. \u201cWe have long recognised the unique position that Sky occupies,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cAnd unanimously recommend this offer by Comcast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
