Spanish media yesterday claimed City were hoping to tempt the 31-year-old forward to England with a massive salary, and, while City played the story down, Ra\u00fal confirmed there had been contact. However, Madrid's all-time record scorer, who made his debut for the Spanish giants 15 years ago, was also adamant that he has no intention of leaving his home-town club. \"It's true that there has been contact with my representative Gines Carvajal from Manchester City, but I've not considered it because I'm not going to leave here. This is my club, and I want to finish my playing career here. \"When they told me of Manchester City's offer I didn't have a single moment's doubt. My place is here and I still think I can help the team win titles.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
