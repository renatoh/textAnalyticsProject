But none has lasted anything like as long or been as productive as that between producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, which began in the early 1960s and is still going confidently with their new movie Le Divorce. Their personal backgrounds bring together the Indian subcontinent, North America and Europe, and their subject matter throughout has been the comedy, tragedy, confusion and snobbery attendant upon the confrontation of different cultures. Most of their work has been set in the past; literary adaptations have outnumbered original screenplays; their movies have a poised, ironic tone and upper middle-class settings. These factors have combined in recent years to attract sneers from younger moviegoers, and their films to be dismissed as 'heritage cinema'. This is to do them less than justice, for their versions of James and Forster and the adaptations of The Remains of the Day and Heat and Dust are among the most socially relevant movies of recent years. Based on a novel by Diane Johnson and featuring most of the team's characteristic themes and tropes, Le Divorce is in their lighter vein. Its heroine, Isabel Walker (Kate Hudson), is a confident, outgoing Californian in her early twenties, coming to Paris for the first time. As her name suggests, she's a comic twenty-first century version of Henry James's Isabel Archer of Portrait of a Lady. Isabel is visiting her sister, Roxeanne (Naomi Watts), a gifted poet who is three months pregnant with her second child and is being deserted by her self-absorbed, self-deceiving French husband, a painter from a haut-bourgeois family. He leaves home in the taxi that Isabel has arrived in, thus introducing the neat plotting that characterises the film. Over a period of around a year Isabel becomes the concurrent lover of a young Bohemian musician living in a Belleville bedsit and a preening right-wing thinker and TV pundit (Thierry Lhermitte), a married man with a fancy apartment in Montmartre. Along the way she accumulates a splendid drawerful of sexy French lingerie, and becomes the amanuensis of a celebrated expatriate novelist (Glenn Close) who as a young woman was also the mistress of the same smug academic. There's an attempted suicide, a murder and a climax on the Eiffel Tower, and the tone is very knowing in the manner of a special supplement in Vanity Fair on where you should stay, eat and shop in Paris, and what to think about the French. As in numerous Merchant-Ivory movies there is a contested work of art running through the narrative - in this case a painting of St Ursula by Georges de La Tour that is contested in the divorce. There's also an emblematic handbag from Herm\u00e8s - a red, crocodile number known as 'a Kelly' because it was popularised by Princess Grace. The bag is last seen floating over the roofs of Paris as a homage to the red balloon in Albert Lamorisse's film of that name. In Le Divorce couture meets culture and everything is in approved good taste. When Roxeanne reads to a bookshop audience, it's Anne Bradstreet's seventeenth-century poem 'To My Dear and Loving Husband', and her voice chokes; when her daughter watches TV, The Red Shoes and La Belle et La B\u00eate are showing. One is not always sure whether class and national attitudes are being satirised or merely displayed. Someone remarks that the cool, practical French react to everything by saying bien s\u00fbr or c'est naturel, and a few minutes later, to confirm that speaker's sagacity, a French character says 'bien s\u00fbr ' and 'c'est naturel'. The characters are thinly drawn but they're played - as always in a James Ivory movie - by a fine cast. This picture is better than the trio's last venture into expatriate Paris, the dull fictionalised account of James Jones's life there, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, and in a different class from French Kiss, Meg Ryan's grotesque Gallic adventure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
