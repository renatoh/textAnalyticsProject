Gough\u2019s Tense Past opened earlier this month at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) as part of Hobart\u2019s winter festival, Dark Mofo. Curated by Mary Knights, it combines 25 years of Gough\u2019s acclaimed creative work \u2013 videos, sculptures, text work and design \u2013 responding to what she refers to as her \u201clife\u2019s journey\u201d: her forensic combing through diary entries, news reports and official government records to track the murders and massacres of Indigenous men, women and children during the black war. In the early 1800s, the state\u2019s Indigenous population numbered around 6,000; a generation later, it was just a few hundred. The names of the dead and circumstances of their murders have been largely excised from Tasmania\u2019s story, but Gough has spent her career doing everything within her power to rediscover and preserve them. \u201cI think I just keep doing the same artwork, sometimes,\u201d she says deprecatingly, of the varied pieces that surround us. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep beating my head against the wall.\u201d The chilling proof of colonial genocide on display comes part from Gough\u2019s own research (Gough holds three arts degrees, but also trained as an archaeologist) and part from her interrogation of other institutional archives \u2013 including TMAG\u2019s own. Taken together, along with her artistic responses, the effect is overwhelming, and sickening. An 1830 news report tells of \u201cone of the blacks\u201d being speared by a pitchfork through the chest. Another talks of 17 \u201cmiserable black natives\u201d being shot in cold blood. We read of a young man boasting about killing \u201cthree crows\u201d; of Gough\u2019s own ancestor Dalrymple Briggs, who survived being stolen from her parents and shot by her master; and of many, many children who were stolen, abused, killed. The site of the exhibition adds an extra tension. The TMAG collections were established in the 1840s by the Royal Society of Van Diemen\u2019s Land \u2013 but before then, two of its buildings served as both the bond store and the commissariat during the black war. Gough describes them as \u201chaunted buildings \u2026 this museum has held the bones, the skeletons, of a lot of Aboriginal people\u201d. It\u2019s situated in Hobart among other \u201cheritage\u201d buildings like the Hope &amp; Anchor pub across the road, which celebrates its status as a \u201ccolonial bar and restaurant\u201d and displays artefacts of British colonialism. After an afternoon spent among Gough\u2019s work, it\u2019s difficult to understand why anyone would want to broadcast that history. \u201cYeah, the whole island is that,\u201d says Gough, a descendant of the Trawlwoolway people of north-east Tasmania. \u201c\u2018Heritage Tasmania\u2019 automatically means non-Aboriginal heritage \u2026 things are really askew here.\u201d Gough\u2019s artistic practice talks back to these wilful gaps in history. In her video series Hunting Ground, she overlays images of bucolic landscapes with historical text about the massacres that occurred there. When Gough visited some of those sites, she posted notices in situ for the public to find, informing passersby of the head counts. The impulse to \u201cbring hidden histories to light\u201d is one she says she has always had. \u201cWhen I was a child we moved house a bit,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cOne time I pulled off the plastic of one of those long doorstoppers, and left a big letter inside, about who we were when we lived in this house \u2026 I think it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re not completely erased from a place, or a story.\u201d Her work has, at times, been risky. For the video piece Observance, she hid in the bushes to film groups of ecotourists who pay a private company $2,400 for the pleasure of tramping across her maternal country, Tebrikunna in north Tasmania. The voyeuristic footage makes any non-Indigenous viewer who has walked blithely across country feel shame and complicity. \u201cThere\u2019s this constant procession of visitors,\u201d Gough says. \u201cIt feels like the number of footsteps \u2013 the air breathed, and the people\u2019s dreams \u2013 could eventually overtake ours and our ancestors \u2026 it disrupts the energy of a place.\u201d For The Gathering, Gough drove past scores of Tasmanian colonial estates with a camera trained at the fences and gates that shut her out. She then jumped out of the car to steal back a piece of stone from each. Many of these properties have been converted into luxury accommodation and wineries. Some still belong to the colonists\u2019 descendants. \u201cIn my head sometimes I feel I might go \u2018missing\u2019 \u2013 killed, yeah,\u201d Gough says, with a half-smile that suggests she\u2019s only half-joking. \u201cI don\u2019t know the state of mind of some of these [colonial] families that have been here for so long. They\u2019re like a kingdom upon themselves.\u201d In another room, a bundle of half-finished spears are trapped in the seat of a chair, which is suspended on a wall. On each spear is carved the name of a Tasmanian Aboriginal child who was orphaned or stolen from his or her parents during the black war. Gough has spent decades attempting to recover these children\u2019s names and stories. \u201cI\u2019ve now [found the stories of] 185 children \u2026 but that\u2019s just the ones who are recorded,\u201d Gough says. \u201cI\u2019ve exhausted birth, death, marriage notices; [lists of] orphan, asylum and children requiring education; newspaper reports, inquest reports. It feels sad \u2026 there are probably five times more than that.\u201d For the temporary exhibition Missing or Dead \u2013 a companion to Tense Past \u2013 Gough created 185 posters summarising everything she could find out about these 185 children. She pinned them to 185 trees in Queens Domain for Dark Path, Dark Mofo\u2019s night-time outdoor installation. The memorial was expansive, compelling the viewer to meander off the main track as they read about each one, lest any child be forgotten again. \u201cWithout the Mofo effect, the work wouldn\u2019t be up,\u201d Gough says of the funding and audience the festival could offer. But the theme this year was \u201cforest\u201d, a word which \u201csets off an acid reflux\u201d for Gough. \u201cThat idea of a forest is totally European \u2013 the fairytale forest world is not Australian. And for a lot of Tasmania the word \u2018forest\u2019 is aligned entirely with Forestry Tasmania, which is about the decimation of our country.\u201d The true history of Tasmania continues to be glossed over. When she was studying tourism, Gough remembers being placed on a historic Port Arthur tour where \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to mention Aboriginal people at all\u201d. (The agency responsible explained to the Guardian that \u201cuntil further discussions with our local Aboriginal communities occur, we do not believe we are well equipped to interpret Aboriginal history at our sites\u201d.) And while Gough believes education is getting better, particularly among younger people, she says, \u201cI think it\u2019ll be another 50 years before things really change.\u201d She adds a bleak rejoinder: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a planet then anyway.\u201d \u2022 Julie Gough\u2019s Tense Past, presented by Dark Mofo, is on at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery until 3 November \u2022 The Guardian was a guest of Dark Mofo and Tourism Tasmania"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
