A real shame that this match never really got going, as the Ukrainian team would surely have tested the German champions with 11 men. But credit to Bayern, as Lewandowski aside, they were typically clinical. There will be slight worries for both Robben and Ribery, who were both substituted with injuries. It is also maybe the last time we will see all those Brazilians in a Shakhtar shirt in Europe, with a a number of clubs poised to make bids for Costa, Fred, and Teixeira in the summer. Man of the match? Boateng: one goal, two assists. Tidy. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time! Oh, and I know he\u2019s not German, but if you want to see a clip of David Alaba singing Justin Bieber, you can do so here, courtesy of Dominique Lang. Game over. But that was probably the case in the third minute, when Bayern got their penalty and Shakhtar had Kucher sent off. 90 min: One minute added on here. Muller managed to nick the ball away to \u2026 wait for it \u2026 Boateng who rather than defending the corner, was loitering on the half-way line?! Why? How? I guess you can do what you want when you\u2019re 6-0 up. Boateng beats his man (LOL) and squares it for Gotze, completely unmarked at the back post. It\u2019s actually poor control from Gotze, but he recovers and fires a smart shot through the legs of Shevchuk and inside Pyotov\u2019s near post, catching the keeper off-guard. Well that was inevitable with Shakhtar\u2019s defence stranded upfield. 86 min: Corner for Shakhtar and a rare opportunity for their defenders to get forward. It\u2019s a good knockdown from Stepanenko at the far post, can Adriano turn it in from close range?! No. Schweinsteiger clears, M\u00fcller collects. Bayern are on the counter-attack, ut-oh.... 84 min: HAHAHAHA. David Luiz has just scored a equaliser for PSG at Stamford Bridge. The game is heading for extra-time, with the aggregate score at 2-2. 82 min: So nearly a hat-trick for M\u00fcller! Rafinha, who has played well tonight (albeit he hasn\u2019t had to think about defending), gets forward again, whipping another cross into that near-post area. M\u00fcller meets it six-yards out but side-foots his first-time finish inexplicably wide. How very un-M\u00fcller of him. 80 min: Lewandowski is dropping increasingly deeper to pick the ball off Schweinsteiger. Kryvtsov is being dragged around like a rag doll, with Gotze, M\u00fcller and Bernat running into the empty space beyond. Meanwhile in the other game tonight\u2026 Chelsea have taken the lead against PSG. Read the latest in our MBM. 78 min: Shakhtar make their final change: Costa coming off for Wellington Nem. Costa looks relieved to be coming off to be honest, and who can blame him? Can\u2019t say the Barcelona scouts will have learned an awful lot tonight though. It\u2019s probably the first occasion in the entire match, where Shakhtar have played a high defensive line, and they are punished. It\u2019s a simple long ball, and Lewandowski is clear! He takes it down on his chest with his first touch, is probably a little heavy with his second, but squeezes the ball just under Pyatov to get Bayern sixth. Not a convincing finish, as he almost let Rakitskiy recover, but at least he\u2019s on the scoresheet. The Pole gets his goal! 73 min: Bayern are just pinging it about so let\u2019s have more footballers liking dodgy music, and Simon Frank has reminded us of this Simon Gerrard episode, in which he alledgedly had a fight trying to get a DJ to play a Phil Collins record. Read this article from 2008, which includes the paragraph... One report suggested Gerrard and a group of his friends were involved in an altercation after the man refused to allow them to choose the songs played on the venue\u2019s sound system. Gerrard is a big fan of Phil Collins and counts the singer\u2019s greatest hits as his favourite album. He is also partial to Coldplay. I\u2019d take slight issue with this inclusion, as Phil Collins was actually quite good. 70 min: Change for Shakhtar, Teixeira off for Ilsinho. Brazilian for Brazilian. 68 min: Bayern break and Lewandowski twists and turns on the edge of Shakhtar\u2019s box, as he tries to work the place for a shot. There was willing runners there, and it would have been much better to lay it off, but Lewandowski is obviously desperate to get a goal. Eventually he is closed out. 5-0 at home, and your main striker still hasn\u2019t scored. Is that a worry? 66 min: And that is almost the last act for Badstuber, who is replaced by Dante. Badstuber gives Pep a wry smile, and Pep gives him a pat on the head in return. Shakhtar clear the corner, but Rafinha picks up the loose ball, drives to the byline and delivers a wonderful cross, with pace, to the near post. Badstuber, still up from the corner, manages to get clear of his marker and bullets his header at goal. It\u2019s straight at Pyatov but the Ukrainian can only tip it onto the inside of the post, before it trickles into the net. Keeper should have done better. You know I said Bayern had two defensive-minded players on the pitch tonight? They\u2019ve scored two goals and had one assist... 61 min: Bernat almost makes an immediate impact \u2013 dancing his way past three Shakhtar defenders. Dropping the shoulder, he steals a yard from Kryvtsov and shoots low and hard. Pyatov looks as though he\u2019s got his feet in a muddle but somehow it catches the back of his heel and squirts behind for a corner. 58 min: Here come a Bayern sub: Bernat on for Ribery, who looks to have come off badly from that Fred challenge, whilst Stepanenko receives some treatment, both himself and Rakitskiy seem to be struggling. Meanwhile, there is an update on Robben, he\u2019s got a trapped nerve. Ouch. 56 min: You have to applaud Fred for his performance tonight, his stamina has been immense in lieu of Shakhtar\u2019s 11th man. This time he bundles Ribery off the ball to kill a threatening Bayern counter-attack and offloads it cleverly. Great play. 54 min: What a chance for Shakhtar! The tie might be over, but that was a lovely move. This was the first time that the Brazilian\u2019s had been given any time of space inside Bayern\u2019s half, and they used it well: Teixeira, Fred and Costa combining to free up some space on the left. The full-back Shevchuk is completely free, takes a touch and fires in a low cross towards Adriano. The centre-forward tries to poke it towards goal, but it\u2019s a great block from Badstuber on the six yard box. Saved a certain goal. More Ribery wizardry, this time he beats Srna to get to the byline, before firing a low cross across the six-yard box. Pyatov comes off his line but his tip only takes it away from his defenders, and M\u00fcller is there to mop up, finishing into an empty net. Oh dear. Simple goal: Ribery cuts inside after some wonderful interplay with Gotze, plays a one-two with Boateng (what is he doing in Shakhtar\u2019s penalty box again?!), gets his head up and slips a calm finish into the bottom right hand corner. Pep continues to celebrate like he\u2019s won the World Cup. Fair do\u2019s. This could end up being a cricket score. 47 min: There are a few occasions where Shakhtar have had some encouraging positions on the counter-attack but a poor pass has broken the move up. This time it\u2019s Fred who is the guilty man. You can put that down to the Bayern pressing though, I suppose. Peeeep, here we go again. The teams are back out, there are no changes. It\u2019s unclear if Pep was lambasting Lewandowski in the tunnel just there, or if he was just enthusiastically telling him to DO SOMETHING. Half-time entertainment, and it\u2019s another instalment of out \u2018German taste in music\u2019 series. Hat-tip: Canada\u2019s Travis Dudfield. The following is from this 2006 Simon Hattenstone blog. \u201cBeing German, I love David Hasselhoff. It\u2019s actually the law back in the Motherland. For me the Hoff is almost like some kind of higher spirit. Hoff-ness is everywhere. The Hoff is a big inspiration - in times of trouble I often ask myself, \u2018how would The Hoff deal with this situation?\u2019\u201d ex-Fulham full-back Moritz Volz For those who like Volz, I would encourage you to visit his website, Volzy.com, which includes a catchy Englishman in New York-based soundtrack, and a list of his favourite websites, which includes\u2026 Nando\u2019s. What a shame we had to have that early red card for Kucher. Bayern with one foot in the quarter finals. 45 min: The half is rather petering out here, Bayern keeping the ball, and seem happy to see this out. 43 min: Regarding better penalty takers... David French also seconds that, on the email. 41 min: Lewandowski has had a poor half, despite Bayern\u2019s dominance. First he gives a cheap free kick away to give Shakhtar\u2019s defence a breather, then on Bayern\u2019s resulting counter-attack, can only muster a weak shot straight at Pyatov. 38 min: Ooooo a fracas. Ribery goes down off the ball, with other Bayern players claiming Costa elbowed him in the back of the head. Boateng is incensed and starts some handbags. Bayern\u2019s players are asking for a red, but the ref only dishes out yellows to Costa and Boateng, for his reaction. The Allianz Arena booes, but there doesn\u2019t look to be anything in that alleged elbow. 36 min: What is perplexing is how deep Shakhtar are defending. Bayern are often able to play keep-ball, even inside their opponents\u2019 box. \u201cThought the penalty and red card in this match was weak but red against Ibra in the other match was insanely wrong,\u201d emails Gene Salario. \u201cNice to see though that Arjen is sharing his years of experience with the younger Bayern players.\u201d Not sure it was his generosity of spirit that lead to the substitution, but ok. 33 min: It\u2019s not the prettiest goal, but Guardiola and co won\u2019t care about that. Muller heads a clever knock down to Lewandowski, who despite being on the six yard line, has enough time to take a touch, turn, and fire a point-blank shot at Pyatov. The keeper makes a superb save, but Boateng \u2013 what on earth is he doing there? \u2013 tapping in the rebound from two yards. He\u2019s not offside, with Srna on the goalline. Game over, surely? And there\u2019s the killer goal. 30 min: Corner to Bayern. Shakhtar are defending admirably, although they have been a touch lucky, but you sense that if Bayern find a second, that will be the tie over. As it stands, Shakhtar still need just one. Update from the Chelsea v PSG game, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been sent off! Follow it live here. 28 min: Goalmouth scramble! Shakhtar survive! Ribery jinks right, then onto his weaker left before firing a strike at Pyatov. It\u2019s not in the corner, but one of those low, central shots that sometimes catches keepers out. Pyatov gets down well, and Srna is able to hack clear at about the 746,936th attempt. 25 min: Gotze loses possession to Teixeira, who intercepts the pass before poking the ball beyond Badstuber. It\u2019s a pretty blatant foul from the German, and a yellow card for Badstuber. Rightly so. 24 min: Shakhtar can\u2019t get out of their half. Neuer is standing just next to the half-way line. He already looks very bored. 23 min: What a miss from Lewandowski! Simple cross played in from the right from Rafinha, and Lewandowski is completely unmarked at the back post! He has time to judge the flight before planting a bullet header against the far post from eight yards out, with the rebound landing safely, as far as Shakhtar are concerned. It should be 2-0. 21 min: We\u2019ve had a couple more replays on that penalty decision. Whether it was correct or not, it has ruined the tie somewhat. \u201cShould have been a yellow for the dive. Incredibly harsh, and it\u2019s not as if Bayern needed any help,\u201d quips Tim Hughes. 19 min: Bayern in complete control, every pass being jeered. The Allianz is bouncing, just 800 of the 70,000 are Shakhtar fans. 17 min: Robben is being taken off! Rode is ready to come on, it looks at though the Dutchman is feeling his hamstring, although he\u2019s not very happy at coming off. 15 min: Bayern are already peppering Shakhtar\u2019s goal. First Robben hits a volley \u2013 did that striker Shevchuk\u2019s arm? \u2013 but it is blocked, next Ribery cuts inside but his effort is closed down well by Kryvtsov. Ouch, very brave, but that looked like that hurt. Hands to the pump, etc. 14 min: First real break for Shakhtar! Fred collects a clearance and plays a lovely one-two with Costa. Fred is clear of the defence but has an entire half to dribble before he reaches Bayern\u2019s goal... outstanding tackle from Boateng. The German showed such pace there. First sign of danger there though, and remember one goal and Shakhtar are leading this tie. 12 min: Another corner for Bayern, this time a direct result of an outstanding shank by the keeper Pyatov. They are really under the cosh here Shakhtar. 11 min: Bayern work a corner, and it finds its way to Robben, who swivels but can only blast over. 9 min: Shakhtar make their change: Taison, an attacking midfielder coming off for Kryvtsov, who is a central defender. Shame for Taison, who was bright in the first leg, and who also has a magnificent head of hair. Think Willian, x20. 7 min: So close for Bayern! Lewandowski sets off down the left channel, and he has the legs on Rakitskiy, breaking into the box. The Pole is forced wide but dinks the ball over the onrushing Pyatov. His cross/shot evades both the inside of the far post, and Robben who was stretching to reach it. Behind for a goal kick. Shakhtar really need to reorganise now that they are down to 10 men. Missing their key central midfielder. 5 min: Costa shows good feet in the middle and releases Adriano who wins a corner. Cor, this just got a whole lot harder for Shakhtar, surely a set piece is their best hope of an away goal. Easily cleared by Bayern. Never in doubt. Is there a better penalty taker in the world? Bayern\u2019s first slick move of the night, completely carves apart the centre of Shakhtar\u2019s defence. Gotze glides through and gets himself between Kucher and the ball. There looks to be minimal contact, but the German hits the deck regardless. Kucher is judged to be last man \u2013 he probably was \u2013 so he\u2019s off. Question marks still remain over the contact though, replays are unconvincing. Muller gives Pyatov the eyes, sends him the wrong way and passes the ball into the bottom left hand corner. 3 min: PENALTY TO BAYERN! RED CARD TO SHAKHTAR\u2019S KUCHER! 2 min: Bayern have assumed control of the football, and have already tested Neuer with three difficult backpasses, which the keeper has dealt with supremely. He\u2019s quite good, isn\u2019t he? Peeeeeep! And we\u2019re off! The teams are out, Bayern in their red and white strip, whilst Shakhtar are in white, with an orange trim. The Champions League anthem is playing, cue goosebumps, etc. Let\u2019s do this! Kevin Richtscheid, from Canada no less, has got in touch with tonight\u2019s first email: \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly demonstrative of Germans with bad taste in music, but who can forget the following clip: As good as Thomas M\u00fcller\u2019s moves are, don\u2019t miss Manuel Neuer\u2019s in the background. That hand swish is something else. World Cup victory for these two was inevitable.\u201d As the Ukraine crisis rumbles on, in an attempt to persuade their Brazilians not to leave, Shakhtar have launched a training camp in the South American nation, which is nice/should hoover up the remaining talent on the continent. Shakhtar\u2019s chief attacking threat will be based around their four Brazilians: Douglas Costa, Teixeira, Taison, Adriano. All eyes, not least the reported Barcelona scouts in attendance in Munich tonight, will be on Douglas Costa, who looks certain to move on this summer. Chelsea considered a bid for him before they signed Cuadrado and Roma are also said to be interested. Costa would cost around \u00a330m, he\u2019ll be looking to impress tonight. This has no bearing on tonight\u2019s match, other than the fact he used to play for Bayern, but I still think this is an appropriate moment to bring up this tweet from last month. THE GREATEST OF OUR TIME. The Germans aren\u2019t known for their sarcasm, either. Crikey. If there are any footballers you know (preferably German, but whatevs) that you know have awful music taste, do let me know via email michael.butler@theguardian.com or via Twitter @michaelbutler18. Pep has had three interesting things to say ahead of tonight\u2019s match, starting with that he thinks he could be sacked if Bayern don\u2019t get through tonight! I am still young, but I know what would happen if we do not go through to the next stage. I am the coach of a really big club and I know that it is a problem if we don\u2019t progress to the quarter-finals or the semi-finals, even the final. That is part of the business and I am prepared for it. Pep won\u2019t get sacked. But it\u2019s nice of him to admit that he\u2019s mortal. Perhaps there will be surprises for us, we do not know yet what kind of game they [Shakhtar] will play - defensively or not. This is hugely important, figuring out Shakhtar\u2019s mindset. The Ukrainian side are at their best when they counter-attack, which is worrying for a Bayern side that looks almost overly offensive. But will Shakhtar stay compact as they did in the first leg, or push for that vital away goal? They can\u2019t defend for 90 minutes at the Allianz and expect to progress. We have not practised penalties! Wouldn\u2019t worry about that Pep, your team is full of Germans. Oh, and you\u2019ve got Neuer. Tonight\u2019s heroes and villains: Bayern: Neuer, Rafinha, Boateng, Badstuber, Alaba, Schweinsteiger, Robben, G\u00f6tze, Rib\u00e9ry, M\u00fcller, Lewandowski Shakhtar: Pyatov, Srna, Kucher, Rakitskiy, Shevchuk, Fred, Stepanenko, Costa, Teixeira, Taison, Adriano Referee: William Collum (Scotland) Ok folks! Hold onto your hats! Bayern have selected all of two defensive-minded players \u2013 Badstuber and Boateng \u2013 considering that Alaba, Rafinha and even Neuer are constantly looking to get forward. Lewandowski, who didn\u2019t start in the first leg, comes in for Xabi Alonso, which tells you everything you need to know about Bayern\u2019s outlook tonight. I\u2019m going to pluck for a 4-1-4-1 formation, with Schweinsteiger attempting to hold things together in front of the defence. What an important role he\u2019s got tonight. Shakhtar\u2019s only change from the first leg is to bring in Stepanenko, who has returned from suspension, for Fernando. 4-4-2. Hello world! And welcome to Germany v Brazil round three! Firstly we saw Deutschland pummel the World Cup hosts to within an inch of their collective lives last summer, in one of the most memorable matches ever. Last month in the first leg on this here round-of-16 tie, 99% German Bayern and 99% Brazilian Shakhar played out a 0-0, that according to our MBMer that evening, a one Ian McCourt, was so boring he occasionally took to counting his feet. Here\u2019s to hoping tonight\u2019s effort is somewhere between the two. We\u2019d like both goals and tactical competency please, Mr Football. Preferably an early goal, too. And whilst admitting that this preamble\u2019s 99%-based maths is false (Bayern\u2019s Robben, Ribery, Alaba, Shakhtar\u2019s Srna, Pyatov, Kucher to name but a few) in a vain attempt to insert some kind of higher narrative, there is something to the two nations thing. \u201cWe have 13 Brazilians in the squad who are dreaming of exacting revenge against Bayern\u2019s six world champions,\u201d barked Shakhtar manager Mircea Lucescu before the first leg. The sentiment hasn\u2019t changed. The stats are ominous for Shakhtar: Bayern didn\u2019t cede a single goal at home in their Champions League group, and history tells us that after drawing the first leg away in Europe, Bayern have gone on to win the tie 19 out of 21 times. To top it all off, this guy is back. Having said that Philipp Lahm wouldn\u2019t be included in tonight\u2019s squad, Pep has only gone back on his word, the cheeky so and so. Bayern\u2019s captain returned to training last week after breaking his ankle in training in November. The 30-year-old will likely just be putting his feet up on the Bayern bench tonight, but with Javi Mart\u00ednez and Thiago still sidelined with injury, and Xabi Alonso suspended following his red card in the first leg, they are surprisingly light in the middle of midfield, so don\u2019t rule out Pep bringing the little man on if needed. He shouldn\u2019t be needed. But then this round-of-16 has already thrown up some surprising results \u2013 Arsenal 1-3 Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Real Madrid 3-4 Schalke \u2013 and Shakhtar only need a score draw to progress. They were resilient in defence at home, if you can call it that, but with their creative star Bernard still missing, may struggle to prize a Bayern defence apart. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Because football. Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
