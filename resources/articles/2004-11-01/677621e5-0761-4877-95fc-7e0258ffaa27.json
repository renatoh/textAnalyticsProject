They were being flown to Accra, the Ghanaian capital, in RAF Hercules transport aircraft while Gurkha soldiers were providing security on the ground in Abidjan, the capital. The Foreign Office said the British embassy in Abidjan would be closed once the evacuation was complete. Britain's ambassador, David Coates, said he hoped the move would be temporary. John Sullivan, head of Save the Children's operations in Ivory Coast, told Radio 4's Today programme that attacks on foreigners were indiscriminate. \"Much of the rhetoric on television and public radio was very incendiary,\" he said, adding that it was hard for large mobs to distinguish between French and other white-skinned people, who seemed to be the focus of attacks. Yesterday Ivory Coast's main rebel group, the New Forces, said it was boycotting peace talks in South Africa, saying stability could only be restored once the president, Laurent Gbagbo, stepped down. The large-scale evacuation of French and other expatriates continued yesterday with a goal of airlifting 8,000 out within a week. More than 25 people died and 900 were injured in the five days of riots by Mr Gbagbo's supporters. They were incensed that the French had destroyed the country's airforce in retaliation for a government-sanctioned attack on the rebel-held north that killed a number of French aid workers. The New Forces said they were only interested in talks about Ivory Coast's future without Mr Gbagbo in charge. The rebel group did not send a representative to South Africa. \"If we were to go to South Africa, it would be to discuss a future in Ivory Coast without Mr Gbagbo. He is a problem for Ivory Coast. He cannot be a solution,\" New Forces spokesman Sidiki Konate told Associated Press. The refusal of the New Forces to take part is a blow to the efforts of South African President Thabo Mbeki to bring together all sides to find a resolution to the two-year civil war. The talks, endorsed by the 54-nation African Union, are designed to restore ceasefire agreements and pave the way for free elections. The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, said yesterday he would host an urgent summit of African leaders tomorrow to find a response to the crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
