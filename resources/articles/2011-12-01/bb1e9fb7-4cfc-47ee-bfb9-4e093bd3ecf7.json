But print deadlines (for the handful of old folks who still read this on dead tree, hello Mum) mean I can't be dealing with that. And you'll have been following the excellent live blog on the site. Which leaves me with, well, the TV event of the weekend, in terms of interest: Black Mirror (Channel 4, Sunday). And, appropriately, in 15 Million Merits, the second part of Charlie Brooker's murky look at both the modern world and the inside of his own head, characters accumulate credits (mainly by pedalling exercise bicycles) in order to achieve the ultimate goal: an appearance on an X Factor-like talent competition. No coincidence surely, and there's something very neat about hearing \"The winner of X Factor 2011 is [whoever it is]\" on ITV before switching channels and having your nose rubbed in the pointlessness of it all by Brooker satire. Perhaps that's why this one was kept back; but it's much better than the first. That was more of a headline grabber, because of the pig sex. But though well executed, it wasn't very funny, or plausible enough to really disturb. It felt more like one rather blokey joke strung out into a drama. This is more artful. It's striking to look at and beautiful \u2013 the virtual reality, the interactiveness, all the screens. Well, beautiful in a stifling, suffocating way that has you gasping for an open window, a plant, an emotion, something real. None of it feels too far-fetched, though. It's not much of a leap from what we have already with videogames, our reliance on screens, everyone an avatar, social media, talent shows ... well, apart from the fact that these people are actually prisoners. Brooker has taken these things \u2013 not just the technology but the shallow values, the insincerity, Simon Cowell, the futility of so much of modern life \u2013 and woven it into an Orwellian nightmare for the 21st century, a kind of 2184, or more like 2124 at the rate we're going. Again, it might not be very funny (though there are some lol moments, such as Justin the gibbering dickhead and the lol arrow in the Botherguts game). But, hell, it's powerful. Moving too, which the first one wasn't. Bing, played so well by Daniel Kaluuya, is such a tragic hero. His wonderful impassioned rant against the judges is clearly the climax. But then the moment he holds hands with Jessica Brown-Findlay off Downton is almost soppy. Lovely though, and human. These are people you care about, and that makes it more powerful still. (Could this be because Brooker co-wrote this one with Kanak Huq, also known as Konnie, who by happy coincidence is his missus?) All the performances are good \u2013 especially Ashley Thomas as Judge Wraith and Rupert Everett as Judge Hope, the Cowell character. The only shame is how little is made of third judge Julia Davis \u2013 possibly the funniest person on television, and with so little to say or do. Otherwise fabulous \u2013 original, thoughtful, thought-provoking television. As for Brooker, I worry for the inside of head. Possibly the only hope for him and his sanity is to be banned from looking into a screen for a year at least. He should be taken outside, into the sunshine, to somewhere with no phone signal or Wi-Fi (wife may be allowed), a Scottish island perhaps. And he should be made to grow vegetables. The subject of Piers Morgan's Life Stories (ITV1, Saturday) was Peter Andre, \"the most talked-about celebrity in Britain\" according to the host, but maybe he's just saying that to get Pete to open up. Morgan's good like that; he goes hard and soft, prods and fluffs. I mean, he's obviously utterly loathsome, but he is a good interviewer. Pete does open up, about losing his virginity, the (unrelated) panic attacks, the children and the split from Katie. The only thing he won't say is why he walked out on her. \"I don't think me sitting on national television is really the right way to do it,\" says the man who has tried to live his whole life on television. Anyway, he comes across as very nice, honest, open, very handsome obviously. And I really struggled to care about a single thing he said. This is Justin Bieber (ITV1, Saturday) was more interesting. This boy doesn't have panic attacks; he causes them, wherever he goes. Girls scream, go red and hyperventilate. That must be a large part of his life; it must be very odd. I am now a Belieber; it's very hard not to be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
