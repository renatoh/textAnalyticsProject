As the first blows of the New York winter took their bite, I decided to indulge a fantasy that had tantalized me for years. I would embark on one of the world's great rail journeys, a comfortable, turtle-speed plod through the luscious flesh and sensual folds of Mexico's Copper Canyon region. Most who visit this bastion of biodiversity - this collision site of desert, tropical dry forest and sierra woodlands - are in pursuit of something a little more romantic, something more athletic or cultural: a multi-day hike, a horseback or mountain-bike ride into the deepest canyon crannies, camping, cooking out. For the majority, it's a tight, hand-holding itinerary that guides travellers to the sweeping, expansive overlooks, then delivers them to fine hotels where there is little to do but rekindle romance and tangle together, under native-made heavy wool blankets, against the cool air. By these standards, my plan seems unusual and, well, lonely. But I knew I'd be sustained by the copious visual offerings. The generically-named Copper Canyon region is, in fact, comprised of four separate lush river canyons, the Copper Canyon (Barranca del Cobre) not even being the largest. (The Urique Canyon is more than a mile deep at 6,135 feet.) And the railway would serve as a natural front-row seat for the show. As a train buff and a voyeur, my plan was perfect: To go it alone and, as best I could, to sit on my bum. To absorb some temperate weather, to luxuriate in the comforts of old-world transport, and to peep at some of the world's most hardcore nature. All aboard The Chihuahua al Pacifico Railway (\"El Chepe\") connects the Pacific coast town of Los Mochis to the interior desert city of Chihuahua, some 14 hours and \u00a375 to the north-east. Consensus strategy, though, is to dodge Los Mochis, a modern city with more crime than charm. I split for El Fuerte where I'll take a little downtime. The real draw of this charming 1564 town is the El Fuerte River, an area of dramatic natural diversity serving up a sumptuous show of its gratuitous quantities of water fowl: great blue herons, ospreys and egrets. And that's the small change. A noble horned owl stares me down through my binoculars. I'd be missing most of this if not for my expert guide and boat captain, Chal, a kind of spiritualized, one-eyed cowboy. Despite his ocular setback, Chal is spotting stilts, black hawks, and tiger herons like a sniper with his naked eye before focusing his high-powered scope for his three charges to see. That's right. In this boat, it's just me - third wheel? - and a cute middle-aged couple from the States making lovey-eyes on the sly. \"Wild Chachalaca!,\" Chal calls from the back of the boat. \"Three o'clock! Belted Kingfisher on that post!\" And so on for two meditative, sun-drenched hours. Next morning at 8.30am, the burly Chepe pulls alongside the stretch of concrete known as the El Fuerte train station. \"Train's early!,\" says Chal proudly. \"I thought it was scheduled for 8,\" I say. \"Yes,\" he replies matter-of-factly. \"But sometimes it's two hours late.\" This is the first-class train, which is to say, the tourist train. It's twice the price, but unlike the second-class train, \"primero clase\" generally doesn't stop abruptly for the night alongside some spooky farm. Not only do the windows of the Chepe offer a veritable peep show of Mother Nature at her finest, the railway itself is an astounding feat of engineering. Trains aren't made to do much climbing, but the Chepe does it with style. Just outside of El Fuerte (260 feet), the train begins its unbelievable chug to an elevation of more than 8,000 feet, the vast majority of that climbing unfolding over just 70 miles. The railway has its way with the land, grinding through sets of switchbacks and once doing a complete 360-degree loop to gain elevation. It skewers 87 tunnels and rumbles over 36 bridges, turning this turf to Swiss cheese. Visitors to the Copper Canyon, I'm learning, generally fit into one of two categories: the elderly or the couple. Often, they're both. I first got a sense, on the previous night, that I might be doubly out of place in these parts, when a cute, 20-year-old intern in my hotel approached me. \"So, you're travelling with ...\" she said, pausing long. \"You're travelling alone?\" \"You bet I am,\" I faked confidence. \"That's strange,\" she judged. The older couples hold hands and talk quietly across the tables of the dining car. One young couple from San Francisco, are taking a different approach: four weeks in Mexico sleeping in a stank van. \"We got tricked into taking the first-class train,\" says the fellow. \"Where are the people, man?\" I hear that. But I've roughed it on trains before, crossing the entire United States with a friend as hobos one summer. My new mode - spending 18 hours in jets, airports and taxis just to make a 14-hour train ride through gorgeous natural terrain -strike my peripatetic countrymen as indulgent. But while my San Franciscan friends gripe about missing the people, I'm missing the views. Showtime Not far out of El Fuerte, I begin jumping from side to side of this train to absorb the best views. The American Grand Canyon is a rough-hewn, cracker-dry, red-dirt gap carved out of the desert as unlovingly as if by a kid trying to dig to China with a fork. But the Copper Canyon. Oh! She's a temptress. El Chepe is penetrating her voluptuous, verdant folds of terrain, her fleshy crevices which coyly draw the eye inward. Five hours later, the train pulls into San Rafael and I'm the only passenger to hop off. The conductor tries to hustle me back into the train, saying that there are no hotels here. But what he - and most other travellers here - don't know, is what I have to look forward to. Apart from being off the tourist map and off the beaten path, the Uno Lodge is the most successful and breathtaking of a series of canyon-region lodges owned and operated by the region's native Tarahumara people. But \"successful\" is not to say busy, or easily accessible. Julio picks me up and begins the harrowing one-hour drive, over a steep and porous, cliff-hugging road. \"It's my first time behind the wheel,\" he says, smiling. Soon enough, we arrive at a crow's nest of a hotel, the Uno Lodge. The place is a bastion of peace, a lodge perched on the rim of the abyss, miles from the nearest tourist. And as soon as I arrive, I realise that I'm not getting back on that train. I'm spending the balance of my days canyonside. You see, the place is perfect for my purposes: there's nothing to do but sit and watch. That night, the temperature drops to a relatively crisp 10 degrees and the stars pop out of the night sky like a Lite-Brite. The whole thing is, well, romantic. I make my way back to my quarters, a free-standing room, rough-hewn on the outside but with a comfortable interior complete with warm, luxurious bed. What am I doing here alone? Next day, Julio talks me into getting off my rear for a hike around the canyon area. We make our way over centuries-old Tarahumara paths, past countless agave and barrel cacti, and ultimately to a perfect and perfectly terrifying rocky, canyon-rim perch. The wind itself almost seems to echo. A black vulture dives directly overhead, its wings, slicing noisily through the air, actually sound like a passing aeroplane. We're looking down from this perch upon more circling vultures. Come to notice, there are circling vultures above as well. Maybe these guys have seen a gringo like myself swoon in the face of this beauty, teeter and roll silently, deliciously to the canyon floor. Truth is, I have a very queasy feeling sitting here and I begin to entertain a menu of grisly-death possibilities. Rolling backwards into a reverse somersault, catching nothing but an eyeful of blurry copper-coloured rock and a last-grasp handful of loose dirt for the ride down. Or maybe I'll scoot forward to get a marginally better photo to show off in a bar some night, and slide almost peacefully off the edge, face-forward like a kid easing off the high dive. I'm calculating the rate of falling objects over a distance of a mile, accounting for terminal velocity, when Julio asks if I'm ready to go. Yeah, I'm ready. My last night is at the luxurious Mirador Hotel, back on the beaten path, near Divisadero. But this canyon-rim spot also keeps my priorities in mind, each room having gorgeous canyonside decks. From the moment of my arrival, I sit on the porch, gazing meditatively at the jaw-dropping depths of the land until, inch by inch, the sun finally sets. Way to go AeroMexico connects to Los Mochis and Chihuahua City from Mexico City. El Chepe train tickets can be purchased at many upscale hotels or from tour operators.
