McGowan, 65, has held the north-east Victorian seat of Indi since 2013, when she secured a shock victory over the then Liberal frontbencher Sophie Mirabella by 439 votes. Almost 200 people from McGowan\u2019s orange army of supporters, Voices for Indi, have picked rural health researcher and midwife Helen Haines, 57, to be her successor as an independent candidate. \u201cI have decided it\u2019s the right time and she is the right person to receive the baton,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cShe\u2019s tough and she\u2019s strong. I know she will take the battle to Canberra.\u201d Haines said she hopes to help lift the quality of political debate. \u201cI receive this baton from Cathy with absolute strength in my hands and passion in my heart and love for the community that I\u2019ve lived in for 30-plus years,\u201d Haines told reporters in Wodonga. \u201cWe need rural women, we need people from the communities to speak up and say \u2018Canberra, we want better than what we\u2019re seeing.\u2019 \u201d McGowan expects the main political parties will throw everything at Indi. \u201cI say bring it on,\u201d she said. McGowan said she was proud Indi had helped change the Australian political landscape. \u201cWhat we do in Indi, is we put the community first and we don\u2019t play party politics. We do what is best for our community,\u201d she said. \u201cVoters want their interests considered ahead of party politics and personal ambition.\u201d Haines nominated health care access, economic development, climate change as key issues. McGowan will remain in parliament until the poll day and flagged she\u2019ll meet prime minister Scott Morrison for talks on Tuesday. \u201cI will continue to give the job 100% of my time, effort and energy,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cIt remains business as usual.\u201d She will support, mentor and advise Haines throughout the campaign and as an MP, if she wins the seat. The Nationals\u2019 deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, has hinted she may contest the seat. McKenzie recently moved her office from Bendigo to Wodonga and has refused to rule out a potential switch to the lower house. The Liberals have preselected Steve Martin for Indi and Eric Kerr will run for Labor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
