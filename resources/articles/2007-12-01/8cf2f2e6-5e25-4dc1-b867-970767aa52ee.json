Sure enough, they have, against the backdrop of an officially licensed 2008 Olympics game. And they've brought their mates - Wario, Luigi, Peach, Amy, Knuckles et al. As you'd imagine, Mario &amp; Sonic At The Olympic Games is much like Daley Thompson's Decathlon updated for the Wii, with countless pleasingly diverse events (including rowing, diving, swimming, trampolining and archery), each with a quirky system that will have you gesturing wildly. The more arcane ones require practice before you master the controls, and little attempt is made at a coherent single-player game. Hardcore gamers will, no doubt, turn their noses skywards when they see it, but its infectious and addictive nature, particularly when played against others, renders it classic post-pub, party-time Wii fare. Steve Boxer Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men PS3/XBox 360, \u00a349.99, cert 18+, IO/Eidos, 2/5 Inspired by the movies of Michael Mann and developed by the team behind Hitman, Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men should be a lot more interesting. This third-person shooter suffers from fiddly controls, drab graphics and callous difficulty spikes. The unsympathetic characters don't help, but the gameplay is the problem. Some of the action borders on the sadistic, with waves of assailants giving you little chance to breathe. The inconsistent cover system that sees you sticking to some walls and not others is another problem. These flaws just make the occasional glimpses of potential all the more frustrating. The highly original multiplayer mode redeems things slightly. You start as a member of a heist team; the twist comes when you get killed. At this point you join the police and attempt to stop the break-in. If you stay alive during the heist there's always the risk that a fellow gang member may decide to take you out and escape with the loot. Tense and inventive, the multiplayer mode is the only reason to play an otherwise disappointing action game. Greg Howson Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Wii, \u00a339.99, cert 18+ Capcom/Nintendo, 3/5 Those expecting the first Resident Evil story on Wii must make do with this first-person hybrid instead. Revisiting key locations from previous episodes (but disappointingly not the excellent RE4), there's a good variety of fast and shambling enemies to stab or shoot. Your Wiimote does both jobs well, but headshots remain fiddly, making the bosses even more of a challenge. Graphically impressive and loaded with excellent cutscenes and plot twists, the gameplay soon becomes repetitive like all lightgun titles. Although thoroughness is rewarded with hidden pathways and bonus items galore, true fans of this enduring series may want to save their pennies for RE5.
