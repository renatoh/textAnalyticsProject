According to a report by the market analysts Datamonitor, the insurance industry is sitting on a ticking bomb of rapidly increasing claims, forcing a rise in premiums. It is forecast that within four years, 1m people a year will be claiming compensation in Britain. The report found that society is increasingly comfortable with the notion of compensation and that litigation is moving up the pay scale from unskilled workers to middle class professionals. Seventy-eight per cent of people feel it is morally and socially acceptable to pursue a claim and 72% would consider making a claim if they were injured and felt someone else was at fault. The cost to the NHS of personal injury claims is already over \u00a3400m a year. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has said he wants to look at alternatives to reduce this bill. A system of fixed compensation payments for patients injured by a doctor will be set out in a white paper. The report estimates that of the 10.4m accidents each year in the UK, 1.7m could result in compensation claims. Last year there were 744,000 personal injury and illness claims but by 2005 this is forecast to have grown by a third and there will be almost 1m claims. The withdrawal of legal aid for personal injury claims - in April 2000 - has passed personal injury litigation to the private sector and the growing use of television advertising has led to a surge in claims. The report says: \"The change in legislation has heralded the entry of accident intermediaries into the market, with massive advertising budgets and high profile brand promotion. This new breed of player now holds 25% of the personal injury litigation market.\" It says advertising is increasing consumer awareness and offering more people than ever access to justice. But insurance companies are unhappy with what they perceive to be inflated legal costs, and are refusing to pay out in cases where they believe the charges to be too high. Mark Harvey, secretary of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said the number of solicitors involved in the market had fallen, however, since legal aid was withdrawn. \"Solicitors have recognised that the no win, no fee means they have to be very good at what they are doing,\" he said. Mr Harvey blamed insurance companies for fanning the flames of claims. On the one hand, companies were selling after-event insurance which protected claimants, but they were also selling liability insurance, which protected organisations in the event of claims. Because it is costing insurance companies more to underwrite claims they have to recoup the money elsewhere - for example from motoring policies. The UK returns only 10% of people to work successfully after a serious injury, in comparison with 50% in Scandinavia. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said yesterday that it was looking at ways of speeding up the compensation process. The government hopes to create a system which is fair for NHS patients and health professionals, to reduce the blame culture and, where possible, remove the burden of legal costs from the taxpayer. Vicki Summerhayes, a financial services analyst with Datamonitor, said: \"The winners of the accident intermediary sector will be those that manage to balance advertising clout with an ethical long term business model that dispels the profiteering image and is perceived as trying to help the injured party in practical ways, as well as seeking to obtain fair compensation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
