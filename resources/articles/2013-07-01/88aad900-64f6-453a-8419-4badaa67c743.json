The red-curtained stage regularly hosts national (if often sedate) touring acts, stand-up comedians and bestselling authors, as well as the occasional theatrical or musical production. The 1,700-capacity space doesn't look much from the outside but its vertical neon marquee hides one of the most charming rooms in the region. \u2022 1621 Glenarm Place, +1 303 623 0106, paramountdenver.com Gothic Theatre A few minutes south of downtown Denver, this 1920s art-deco theatre has a wide, inviting floor, a tiered balcony and excellent views throughout. Adding to the backlit cabaret vibe is the recently muscled-up booking and promotion of the Gothic, following its takeover by live music promotor AEG Live. Few venues deliver as much atmosphere and comfort with such a range of shows. \u2022 3263 South Broadway, Englewood, +1 303 789 9206, gothictheatre.com Swallow Hill Music It's easy to tap into Denver's storied folk-music heritage with a show here: it's a non-profit school and complex that grew out of the Denver Folklore Center to host more than 200 shows annually at on-site venues such as Daniels Hall and the Tuft Theatre. Bluegrass banjo jams, Native American singer-songwriters and touring artists such as Leon Redbone share rooms with calm, appreciative audiences at this all-things-acoustic haven. \u2022 71 East Yale Avenue, +1 303 777 1003, swallowhillmusic.org Bluebird Theater Denver has no shortage of mid-size music venues, but the Bluebird Theater, a neon-ringed former movie house and rehabbed porn theatre, is arguably the best. Excellent sightlines and a chest-rattling sound system complement a mix of heavy metal, indie acts and singer-songwriters at this always-busy, 500-capacity room. Think Art Brut, Kurt Vile, Hank III, Apples in Stereo and Mason Jennings. Don't let the sometimes-surly staff dissuade you from throwing your best devil signs. A small but homey balcony offers a darkened spot from which to sip your lager in anonymity. Be sure to explore the colourful bars and restaurants along this hip stretch of Colfax Avenue before the show. \u2022 3317 East Colfax Avenue, +1 303 377 1666, bluebirdtheater.net The Grizzly Rose Cowboy hats and Levi's are the uniform at this sprawling country-and-western nightclub north of downtown. It devotes as much space to mechanical bulls and pool tables as line-dancing floors and a live music stage (filled with country and hard rock acts six nights a week). Sundays are all-ages, so if you've got a little buckaroo looking to hear some twang, it's the ideal place to push the limits of their bedtime. \u2022 5450 North Valley Highway, +1 303 295 1330, grizzlyrose.com Beta Nightclub Denver's Lower Downtown neighbourhood (LoDo to locals) is packed at weekends, but Beta Nightclub is an oasis in the dude-bro desert. The spare, multi-tiered space is frequently voted among the best electronic music clubs in the world thanks to its top-notch touring DJs and fantastically calibrated sound system. Denver boasts a surprisingly robust dance music scene, but Beta has no competition when it comes to its live roster and sound quality. Chalk it up to the fact that its owner is the co-founder of Beatport, the popular website that doubles as iTunes for DJs. \u2022 1909 Blake Street, +1 303 383 1909, betanightclub.com. Open Thurs-Sat 9pm-2am Meadowlark Bar Before their 2012 Grammy nominations, New York transplants The Lumineers honed folk-pop songs like Ho Hey at the Meadowlark's cozy open-mic scene. The handsome, subterranean bar has a ground-level patio that looks a bit like an exploded garage sale, providing respite from the often shoulder-to-shoulder crowds inside. From DJ-led dance parties to standup comedy and art rock, Meadowlark shows feel like insider affairs for the lucky few who can find it in Denver's rapidly gentrifying warehouse district. \u2022 2701 Larimer Street, +1 303 293 0251, meadowlarkbar.com Dazzle Jazz The purple neon that rings the outside of this Capitol Hill lounge are reflected in the windows of the surrounding buildings, and truly, Dazzle is a beacon for jazz lovers. A performance and dinner space, it hosts the region's best mix of local and national jazz talent, from avant garde to big band and solo artists. But the classy, inviting front room (or Dizzy Room) is equally popular with its liver-testing martini list and appetizer menus constructed from old gatefold LP covers. The Dizzy Room also offers free live jams and pop-in artists, so don't be surprised if your happy-hour drinks are suddenly soundtracked by a sax solo or torch singer. \u2022 930 Lincoln Street, +1 303 839 5100, dazzlejazz.com. Mon-Wed 4pm-midnight, Thurs 4pm-1am, Fri 11am-1am, Sat 4pm-1am, Sun 9.30am-midnight Larimer Lounge The dear departed 15th Street Tavern was one of Denver's go-to places for punk, indie and alternative acts, so when co-owner Scott Campbell founded the Larimer Lounge a little over a decade ago, all eyes were on the scummy, warehouse-district venue. After dozens of clever remodels and barn-burning indie rock shows (including Arcade Fire and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) the Larimer has proved itself as a catalyst for the revitalisation of Denver's underground music scene, and the entire surrounding warehouse district. \u2022 2721 Larimer Street, +1 303 291 1007, larimerlounge.com. Mon-Fri 4pm-2am, Sat 6pm-to close, Sun, dependent on show Hi-Dive This sweaty, Pabst Blue Ribbon-soaked room is the heart of hipsterdom along Denver's bustling South Broadway corridor, hosting touring indie acts on their way up (think Vampire Weekend and Fleet Foxes) and an eclectic assortment of the Mile High City's best bands. The 300-person capacity club is also the home base for Marcus Mumford's pal Nathaniel Rateliff, who plies his delicate folk \u2013 and, lately, raucous soul side project The Night Sweats \u2013 from its tiny wooden stage. Before the show, pop in next door at sister bar/restaurant Sputnik to hear DJs spin vintage wax while you nosh on banh mi Vietnamese baguettes and housemade vegetarian corn dogs. \u2022 7 South Broadway, +1 303 733 0230, hi-dive.com Unless opening times are stated, check listings for details John Wenzel is an arts and entertainment critic at The Denver Post and columnist for The Post's music site, HeyReverb.com.
