And, sure enough, she enjoyed the doll's house-size of our compartment, the staying up late, the little switches, the fold-down basin, the bunk bed, the furtiveness, and the thrill of knowing we'd be waking up in Cornwall. Her dad, however, didn't wake up in Cornwall. Because, to wake up, you have to go to sleep. Sadly, this didn't happen. More sleepless than sleeper. Perhaps it was just me, but the modest compartment meant that lying in bed was akin to trying to sleep on an ironing board travelling at 60mph. Only less comfortable. So it wasn't in the best possible spirits that we landed in St Austell at 7am (though my daughter, naturally, slept brilliantly). St Austell is almost certainly a sweet little town but arriving on a dark, damp, misty morning isn't as exciting as it sounds. Things took a turn for the worse when I asked the taxi driver if there was anywhere to have breakfast. 'At this hour of the morning?' We trooped off towards a newsagent which was, remarkably, open. 'Breakfast? Nobody gets up before nine around here.' After sensing our desperation (perhaps sparked by my disbelieving... 'Nine?... What, nowhere?... Really?'), he asked if a Little Chef would do. Do? DO? Absolutely, fantastic that would be. And so, 25 minutes later having completed the '10-15 minute walk' we settled into a roadside Little Chef and spent an unfeasibly long 90 minutes warming up and eating muffins. If there is a moral to this tale, it may be that whatever else you say about the Eden Project, it is conceivable that the surrounding towns may not be geared up to take advantage of what may be about to occur in a deprived corner of the county. The taxi ride to the Eden Project from St Austell is a little longer than 10 minutes. You leave the town and head out into a desolate landscape. Craters and disused china clay-pits. And not much else. And then, suddenly, you glimpse the top of one of the domes; teasingly it disappears as you spin away, then you catch another glimpse and finally you wind your way down and there, in the middle of absolutely nothing, is this most remarkable of sights. Four interconnecting domes on either side of a grass-roofed building nestling in an excavated, landscaped crater. It looks incongruous and wonderful - this most modern of buildings nestling next to earth and clay and grass and gravel. It looks as though it has landed rather than been built. For many people the attraction of the Eden Project will be in the horticulture and the botany and the plants. But for others it will be experiencing Nicholas Grimshaw's buildings. There are, after all, dozens of conservatories throughout Britain - but none looks like this. This is not so much a building as an event. The visitor centre, which stands on a raised cliff opposite the domes, offers a splendid vantage point (complete with viewing deck). You can look out at the landscaped garden which winds its way down the crater and laps on to the domes. The centre - all hardwood, steel, glass and warm curves - is itself beautifully designed. From this moment the project immediately feels meant - handsome, solid, and confident. Once you've paid through the barriers you can dawdle in the shop or the cafe or read a few Blue Peter -style manifesto boards. From there it is a short walk through the landscaped gardens and into the 'biomes'. To the left is the Humid Tropic Biome, a massive bulbous structure of four interconnecting domes. Simply to stand and gawp is terrific, even if you never venture inside. To find this building anywhere would be a treat, to happen on it in the middle of a cratered countryside adds to the mystique. Step inside and you are immediately transported to a tropical rainforest - the sight all the more remarkable because the vegetation rises up the cliff opposite. Momentarily you can forget you're in an oversize glasshouse. By the time you walk to the top through myriad paths and walkways you look down on the hissing, misting greenery (hundreds of sprinklers spray mist every five minutes) and you half expect Francis Ford Coppola to send in a fleet of helicopters so he can begin shooting his latest film. It feels that real. Needless to say it's hot, with palms, a rubber plantation and a mangrove swamp among the plants from the Amazon, Malaysia, the Oceanic Islands and West Africa. So it's best to go dressed in layers which you can then shed as you shuffle about. The grass-covered roof building in the middle houses a huge restaurant and on the other side is the Warm Temperate Biome. Here you have a dry, hard heat with plants from the Mediterranean, California and South Africa - olive trees, vineyards and flowers. The landscaped garden outside is a third zone - the Cool Temperate Biome. This showcases plants from Britain and - as it benefits from the Gulf Stream and is a sheltered cratered valley - it will sustain vegetation from New Zealand, Chile and Australia. There will be a battery of initiatives at the Eden Project - educational ones, and artistic ones and all manner of ways of interacting with plant life (the Cool Temperate Biome will eventually grow tea which will be sold at a tea stall). They have lots of ideas, plans, and dreams - the people strike you not so much as workers as disciples- hugely enthused by the 'project' and quite evangelical with it. It feels a bit like Glastonbury with plants. There is, it seems, some debate as to whether the Eden Project is horticulturally sound - whether the science is being in some way debased by commerce. Some claim it's Disney with dahlias. Not that that sounds like such a bad idea. But this doesn't feel like Disney. There is an Eden Institution to monitor and develop its science, and much of the curator talent has been scooped up from Kew. It feels genuine. Many people who will never visit Kew or other conservatories will be attracted by the triumphant and giddy architecture and the Eden's sense of fun and excitement. It will undoubtedly open up to a new audience who may, literally, stumble on the plants having come merely to sample the project. It cost less than \u00a340 million of millennium funding (an equal amount was raised from a variety of other sources) and it will draw favourable comparisons with the other dome. It's the idea of Tim Smit (who restored the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall) but he was helped by others, not least the architect Nicholas Grimshaw, who originally agreed to work on it for free, such was his enthusiasm for the project. Michael Heseltine and Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair and Charlie Falconer and the others who plundered \u00a3750m for a one-year theme park should visit the Eden Project and see what can be achieved when the driving force is not political fashion but fierce passion. See what can be achieved when the motivation is an exciting idea, not an expedient initiative. The difference with the other dome is plain to see - here you had a guiding principle pursued with real vigour towards a clear objective. Now, suppose you offered that other dome to Tim Smit? \u0095 Tickets: Adults \u00a39.50, Children 5-15 \u00a34.00, Under-fives free, OAPs \u00a37.50, Students \u00a35, Family ticket \u00a322.
