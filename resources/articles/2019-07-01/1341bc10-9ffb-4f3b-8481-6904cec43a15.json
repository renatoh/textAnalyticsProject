It is widely known that humans can bond over group activities such as watching a movie or playing board games. But it has been unclear whether the underlying psychology behind this effect is present in other species. \u201cHumans have an enormous variety of social bonding activities that we don\u2019t see in other species because they\u2019re somewhat cultural \u2013 for example listening to music or watching movies,\u201d said Wouter Wolf, a graduate student at Duke University in North Carolina and an author on the study. \u201cWe thought that this kind of connecting through shared experiences was uniquely human\u201d In the research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, chimpanzees were placed in pairs and shown a short video. The researchers then measured how long it took them to approach their partners, how close they got and how long they remained in proximity \u2013 two measures of social bonding. The effect was also measured for pairs of bonobos and for great apes paired with humans. Great apes who had viewed the video with either another of their own species or a human approached their partner faster or spent longer in proximity to them, compared with those who had watched the video on their own, the scientists found. The finding indicates that social bonding created by shared experience may have deeper evolutionary roots than previously thought. \u201cAnimals can stand together and watch a waterfall, but they don\u2019t seem to seek out those kinds of experiences,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cSo for a long time we thought they weren\u2019t capable of processing that way or they weren\u2019t feeling any psychological consequences from doing so. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting that at least some parts of the psychology that we need to connect through shared experiences may actually have a slightly older evolutionary history than previously suspected.\u201d Prof Frans de Waal, a primatologist who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cThe effect of synchronisation on behaviour \u2026 is a very old, innate empathy mechanism. Whether [the great apes] understand the shared experience, well, that\u2019s a different thing \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easily demonstrated.\u201d The animals were tracked for only three minutes after they had watched the film, so it is not clear whether shared experiences strengthen social bonds in the long term. The research used animals in captivity, and scientists said it was not known whether the same effects would be observed in the wild. A similar study is being planned to measure the effect in children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
