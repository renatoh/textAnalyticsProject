It's just one of several clunky moments that render tonight a surprisingly gauche affair. Three years and 5m album sales since Mike Batt plucked a 19-year-old Melua from music school and wrote the album Call Off the Search for her, Melua remains an artist uniquely lacking in identity. The problem is one of authenticity. It's hard to take seriously tracks such as Piece by Piece, purportedly a confessional of long dark nights of the soul, when it is sung with an upbeat perkiness by a fresh-faced girl who looks too young for driving lessons. Melua never sounds as though she is singing about her own life or, indeed, anybody's. She is hard to dislike but impossible to love. Songs such as the pretty I Do Believe in Love, performed at the piano and accompanied by a viola player, are recited with polished blandness and prim efficiency. The wordy Halfway Up the Hindu Kush sounds as though it could have been written for a sixth-form music project. Matters decline further when Melua is joined by her thick-wristed band, who manage the disturbing feat of reducing Marvin Gaye's How Sweet It Is (to Be Loved By You) to honky-tonk bar-room blues. They perform a similar hatchet job on Canned Heat's On the Road Again: Melua gamely gives it her best shot, but she is no rock chick. She closes with Closest Thing to Crazy, and, bafflingly, encores with a spirited stab at the giddy delirium of the Cure's Love Cats and a poignant acoustic lament called I Cried For You. Katie Melua got famous before anything ever happened to her; if she is to find her voice, Mr Batt needs to let her go away and live a little."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
