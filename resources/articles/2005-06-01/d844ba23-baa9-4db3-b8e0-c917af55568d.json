Rejoice. Presumably it's for damage to property, on a massive scale. He's destroyed about half the interiors of this country, turning perfectly decent kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms into ludicrous creations - the insides of fishermen's beach huts, Bedouin tents, Japanese temples. These makeovers may have been mildly amusing for a week or two, but then they became embarrassments. Lock him up, and throw away the key. What, he's not here to stay? Just visiting. Oh dear, he's not at HMP Stafford to make the place over, is he? God help them. You can imagine it ... These bedrooms are far too poky, can we knock them all through. And make it a little less austere - so let's have some sisal on the floor, with rugs on top for more warmth. And paint the walls a rich dark red, to give the place a lovely decadent feel, like a Moroccan brothel. Oooh, I don't like those bars, they break up the shape of the window, can we lose them? And look at that ghastly high fence out there, it's a disaster. I'm sorry, it's going to have to go; we'll take it out and plant a low rosemary hedge instead - it will smell gorgeous in the evening, complementing the Mediterranean ambience inside. No, that's not it either. In fact he's going in to do art with some of the chaps in the prison. It's called Hidden Talent (BBC1), and Laurence wants beautiful things to come out from the ugliness inside. Should be a giggle. Presumably he'll stride in wearing some sort of bottle-green crushed-velvet suit and a frilly shirt, with his long locks flowing out behind. And the chaps inside won't be too impressed. We'll show you changing rooms Laurence, this way please. But no, sadly that doesn't happen either. It does get off to a nicely awkward start though. Laurence is waiting in the art room for the six men he's going to be working with to arrive. They come in one by one. Hello, Jason? I'm Laurence, nice to meet you. Kevin? Hello Kevin. And then he says: \"It's a bit like having a kind of cocktail party, you know. You're waiting for all your guests to arrive, it's all getting quite nervy.\" Jason and Kevin look at each other with a look that says \"twat\". I don't think they have so many cocktail parties inside Stafford prison. The task is that they all - Laurence included - have to produce one work on the theme of parent and child, within a week. Laurence is totally ridiculous throughout, of course. He is painting a religious-looking picture of a mother, based on his own wife, holding a baby, but complains that he's having trouble making his image \"timeless\". Maybe the trouble is that he's got all these people around him: \"There's something about Matthew's feng shui that really affects my drawing,\" he complains. And if talking about Matthew's feng shui wasn't ridiculous enough, he also pronounces it the way that people who believe in it do: fung shway, something like that. More \"twat\" looks. The others somehow manage to ignore LLB and get on with their own art. There's something quite moving about seeing these men so involved in their work. And some of it is very impressive - Gary's clay sculpture of a mother and child, Kevin's interesting layered picture of the prison visiting room. And, weirdly, none of them seem half as irritated with Laurence as I am. His own renaissance offering is the best, but then he did have a classical fine-art training before he set about wrecking Britain. He's not satisfied though; he did manage to achieve \"a mysterious smokiness and richness that suits the image\", but overall he describes himself as being \"reasonably cross\" with the way it's turned out. You're too modest, Laurence. Oh yes, and one more complaint Mr Llewelyn-Bowen: during this film, we get to see inside your own house at one point. And, as you'd expect, it's absolutely lovely. But it's all very classical and expensive-looking. There's marble and ornate wallpaper, no piles of pebbles or fishing nets. And there's nothing Moroccany at all. So all that time we were doing all that ridiculous stuff, you were laughing in your beautiful, elegant house. Lock that man up. And put him in solitary so those other poor men can get on with their art."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
