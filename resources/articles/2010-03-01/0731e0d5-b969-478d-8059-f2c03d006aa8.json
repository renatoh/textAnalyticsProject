The defender returned from a shin injury last month and recently made himself unavailable for England's World Cup squad after it emerged that John Terry, a former Chelsea team-mate, had had an alleged affair with his former partner, Vanessa Perroncel. Manchester City's manager, Roberto Mancini, said at the time of Bridge's England withdrawal: \"It was a difficult decision for Wayne but it was his decision and I respect it. \"I am sorry for him and England because it is important to play for your national team. I thought Wayne would play for the national team but it was his decision and he didn't speak with me.\" Sylvinho or, more likely, Javier Garrido will stand in for Bridge in the City side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
