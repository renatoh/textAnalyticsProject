It has the bright red words \"Theatre for a Change\" emblazoned on the front. Then she slips into a pair of faded jeans and rubber flip-flops and heads for the door. Aryeh knows that wearing this shirt means she'll be bombarded with questions the moment she leaves the house, which is exactly why she puts it on. Outside, a crowd of young people gathers round her. They want to know one thing: how to use a condom. Aryeh is not a doctor or a counsellor - she's an aspiring actress, and was, for a time, a prostitute - but she's used to people asking her questions like these. Ever since her life story became the basis for a play designed to get youth talking about HIV and Aids, students have pestered her for information. \"I always have time for them,\" says Aryeh. \"I can see how much it's changed my own life.\" Aryeh is one of 250 members of Theatre for a Change - a non-governmental organisation founded last year by British performer and producer Patrick Young. The company, composed of Ghanaians between the ages of 12 and 24, uses interactive theatre to encourage people to rethink and change behaviour that leads to HIV/Aids. There are no scripts, because stories are from the actors' real lives. The goal is to reduce the number of new HIV infections among Ghana's young people. It worked for Aryeh: she went for an HIV test just days after joining the company. The results came back negative and she gave up prostitution. Young came up with the idea for Theatre for a Change while visiting Ghana in 2000. \"People were dying, there were no anti-retroviral drugs at that time, and there was a huge amount of silence around the whole illness,\" he says. \"I realised that interactive theatre was a form compatible with cultural performances that were already being used.\" Ghana has an HIV infection rate of 3.6%. While that is low by African standards, experts fear that ignorance and poverty may push the numbers to epidemic levels. From 2000 to 2002, the number of infections rose by 50%. Theatre for a Change plans to take its stories into rural areas where HIV infection is worst. For youths in these communities, the performances will be one of the few ways to learn about HIV/Aids. The company aims to get 36,000 young people involved. The company is struggling for funding. Young is seeking individual donations, and is afraid that if funding doesn't arrive by Christmas, the project will have to shut down. \u00b7 Theatre for a Change is financially supported by the Guardian.
