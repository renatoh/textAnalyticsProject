There was no real plan for jobs and growth, no credible plan for reducing deficits and no steps taken to properly empower the European Central Bank as the lender of last resort. The risk of further economic crisis remains but, inexcusably, the British government did little to address it. Despite the best efforts of the prime minister to present Friday's meeting as the last word on the issue, we still have the chance to make a bad situation better. There is a common view across Europe, as well as within the UK, that what happened was undeniably bad for business and bad for Britain. What is vital now is for Britain to chart a way forward economically, politically and diplomatically in Europe, or we will risk being locked out of the room and bereft of influence just as the economic storms worsen. The best route for Britain to protect our national interest requires two immediate steps \u2013 first, to rebuild alliances and, second, to get a seat at the table. Before David Cameron's decision to walk away from the summit, a number of countries were prepared to make a deal with Britain. Chancellor Merkel said recently that there was \"a lot of common ground\" between Britain and Germany, and we had potential allies in such countries as Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. Cameron should now engage in a serious and concerted diplomatic campaign to repair the damage and secure the influence necessary as another year of fresh economic turmoil beckons. Part of that involves demonstrating Britain's continued willingness to engage constructively on issues such as defence co-operation, climate change and completion of the single market. Alongside this, if the government is to ensure that Britain has a voice on these crucial economic matters, it must seek what Labour was demanding in the runup to talks \u2013 a seat at the table in meetings involving the 26 others. Given that no firewall protecting the integrity of the single market was achieved last Friday, this step is now the best means of securing that and other safeguards. Realistically, given the prime minister's behaviour, he will now have to offer something in exchange. So Cameron could seek this seat at future meetings in exchange for supporting, rather than hindering, pragmatic accommodation on the access of the new group to EU institutions. We could and should have natural allies in the commission and in many smaller countries in this move. Having flounced out of the room last week, only to have to start negotiating his way back in this week, would be a personal embarrassment for the prime minister, but it would be in the best interests of Britain. In this he would be following the example of Margaret Thatcher, who was outvoted at the Milan summit in 1985 on the question of whether there should be a new treaty to bring in the single market. But, despite losing on the principle, she insisted on keeping Britain's seat at the negotiating table. The end result was the Single European Act, which was highly beneficial to growth and jobs in Britain. If Cameron thinks the summit was an end to Europe's economic problems, he is dangerously naive. The collapse of the eurozone would have catastrophic consequences for Britain, so he must not simply walk away from the conversation. The end of the summit was the beginning of a process. No treaty has yet been signed. The task of recovery must now begin in earnest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
