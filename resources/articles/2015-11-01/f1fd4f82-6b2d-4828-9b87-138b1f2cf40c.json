The brothers may not spend as much on the 2016 election cycle as they had initially anticipated, either, Koch told the paper. Earlier this year the brothers said they would raise and spend $889m. The actual figure may be as low as $750m, Charles Koch said. Past presidential candidates backed by the brothers have ended as disappointments. In April, David Koch signaled support for Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin famous for stripping some public unions in his state of collective bargaining rights. But Walker was the first candidate to drop out of the race. A fundraising network attached to the brothers raised $407m for the 2012 campaign, according to a Washington Post analysis of tax documents. The effort failed to unseat Barack Obama, while the Democrats gained seats in both the House and Senate. Charles Koch told USA Today that he is shopping for a candidate who will not only talk the talk but walk the walk (to borrow a recent phrase from Bernie Sanders). \u201cIt\u2019s not only what they say,\u201d Koch said. \u201cIf they start saying things we think are beneficial overall and will change the trajectory of the country, then that would be good, but we have to believe also they\u2019ll follow through on it, and by and large, candidates don\u2019t do that.\u201d Koch sat for an interview this month with MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, whose hosts were accused by no less than the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, of playing softball with their VIP guest. To combat the liability their name has become in certain corners of American politics and society, the brothers and their namesake enterprise, Koch Industries, embarked earlier this year on an image makeover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
