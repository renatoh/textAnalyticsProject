Those \u00a320bn cuts will hurt, but it will be worth it. And this is all well and good until a senior Tory finds that cuts or bold changes are planned in their constituency. On those occasions, each diminution becomes an outrage. The latest to distinguish himself in this regard is the foreign secretary, William Hague, whose battle to protect consultant led maternity and paediatric services at Northallerton's Friarage hospital has failed. Those responsible have decided Hague knows as much about health as diplomacy. Hague says he is disappointed the commissioners have been \"unable to find a unique solution to the challenges facing the hospital\". With gusto, he calls on critics to maintain their opposition. Unless they are trade unionists. They should never rock the boat and should always do exactly as they are told. \u2022 In that respect, Tuesday was a good day for the unions. Worth treasuring. They're aren't many of them. In a triumph for conference management, only a few heckles greeted the speech of the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, at the TUC in Brighton. And all of the strictly unofficial material mentioning anything about the possible sad demise of Baroness Thatcher was exiled \"under the counter\". It all went off very well. Good work. \u2022 And a happy time for constituents of Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary. The voters of south-west Surrey have not previously viewed their MP as a man to stand by the righteous against the might of giant corporations. The minister for Murdoch didn't get where he is today by speaking truth to power. But there he is, leading the charge against plans for a Tesco Express in Godalming. Practically Braveheart, isn't he? But then, Tesco don't own any friendly newspapers. \u2022 Best to stay on the right side of the public or risk the fate of George Osborne, exposed at the Olympic stadium to being booed by 80,000 people. A politician's nightmare. Still they talk about it in parliament. We were told, said Labour's Angela Eagle, \"that a Conservative government would 'crowd-source' ideas, because Conservatives believe in collective wisdom. Will the leader of the House commend the chancellor for going to the Olympic stadium the other night to do his own little experiment with crowd-sourcing, and can he tell us what the chancellor will be doing with the answer he got?\" Seeking revenge, one suspects. Brace yourselves. \u00a310 per hot pasty. \u2022 Troubling early days for Mitt Romney, as it seems Obama might not beat himself and might not even be bested by the state of the economy. Mitt needs help and fast. But he'll be smart enough to set his face against the stalwart Republican preacher Pat Robertson. Last year, Robertson berated his Republicans for being too extreme. This week, the same Robertson advised a man seeking guidance on ways to rein in his wife, who just won't respect him as the head of the household. \"Well, you could become a Muslim and you could beat her,\" says Pat, pronouncing on his show The 700 Club. \"Somebody's gotta stand up to her, and he can't let her get away with this stuff. I don't think we condone wife-beating these days, but something's gotta be done to make her ... \" \"Not physically, of course,\" interjects startled co-host Terry Meeuwsen. Robertson is unmoved. \"You can't divorce her, according to the scripture,\" he says. Better \"move to Saudi Arabia\". Remember that preacher Pat once tried to run for president. \u2022 Finally, Tony Blair and Dominique de Villepin were prime ministers at the same time on the two sides of the Channel. Both left office with the suggestion they may have been involved in monkey business \u2013 war crimes for Tony, financial shenanigans for De Villepin. On Monday, De Villepin was humiliatingly dragged into police custody to be quizzed under caution in a grotty Paris police station for his alleged crimes. Tony, meanwhile, relaunched, was preening over the Olympics and counting the cool million collected from his Qatari employers for three hours fixing on a commercial deal. It ain't right, it ain't fair \u2013 but that's life. Twitter: hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
