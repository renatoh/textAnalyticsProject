His trainer, Kim Bailey, summed up the horse\u2019s progress by saying: \u201cI\u2019m so pleased for his owners because he had a shit year last year\u201d. One of the game\u2019s great frustrations is that you can know your horse has talent and yet be repeatedly unable to prove it. The tale of woe for El Presente last winter began at this track in December, when Bailey imagined he was \u201ca certainty\u201d but watched in dismay as he unseated his rider at halfway. Then the rains came and that was no good for a horse who wants a sound surface. Eventually, his owners insisted on running one day in March on heavy going, a race that yielded no prize money but did uncover the vital knowledge that El Presente needed a breathing operation. That done, he has been busy making hay since jumps racing resumed in July, this victory being his fourth success in four months. \u201cWe had more or less roughed him off after his last run,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt rained, so I thought he\u2019d had his season. Then it started to dry up again. So we threw in an entry and then thought we might as well go. We didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win, we really didn\u2019t. When he got beat at Market Rasen [in August], we thought we\u2019d discovered his limitations. But he\u2019s so tough.\u201d That need for fast ground means El Presente will now be given a winter holiday. Bailey\u2019s aim is to bring him back for the big handicap chase at Sandown on the last day of the season in April, possibly with a prep run beforehand. The Grand National is not thought a suitable target, as the horse prefers a right\u2011handed circuit. \u201cThat was good fun, I love riding him,\u201d said David Bass, the winning jockey. \u201cHe jumps for fun. He was a fit horse who likes the ground and stays all day.\u201d Paul Nicholls fielded three fancied runners in a race he had won for the previous three years and the local trainer seemed set to extend that run as My Way went five lengths clear in the straight. But the youngster\u2019s early exertions took their toll and he was passed by three rivals close to home. El Presente narrowly denied Potterman, a rare setback on an otherwise excellent afternoon for Alan King. His Barbury Castle yard won the November Handicap at Doncaster with On To Victory, who will now go back to hurdling, and also the Elite Hurdle here with Sceau Royal, who could be called the winner a long way from home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a marvellous day and we mustn\u2019t be greedy about the one that got away,\u201d King said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how Sceau Royal is in the morning, but he might be one for the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham next weekend. \u201cHe looks as good as he\u2019s ever been, but we wouldn\u2019t be running him too much on midwinter ground so we might have another go before it starts raining again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
