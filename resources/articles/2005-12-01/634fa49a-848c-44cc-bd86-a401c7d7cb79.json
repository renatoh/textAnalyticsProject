First student: \"Have you joined a gym yet?\" Second student: \"I took a look at the Bloomsbury Fitness Centre, but I liked ULU better.\" First student: \"The Bloomsbury had more of the equipment I normally use.\" Third student: \"I like to work out, but I don't like joining gyms.\" This took me back. Just like the conversations we had in my day. Except they would go like this. First student: \"Have you joined a Marxist party yet?\" Second student: \"I went to talk to the Socialist Workers, but the Workers Revolutionary Party seemed more active.\" First student: \"I prefer the SWP's line on Chile.\" Third student: \"I've always been interested in leftwing politics, but I don't like joining political parties.\" Ricky Gervais, who was on the same course, jokes in his Politics stand-up show about how some students in the department wore paramilitary uniform, just like the Tooting Popular Front. I can confirm this. I just wore combat trousers, bought in a sale at Millets. Looking back on the days of sit-ins and over-cooked lentils, it is easy to disparage current students. But, rather like Michael Winner, who unfashionably declares his admiration for the energy and enthusiasm of people from Essex, I have tremendous regard for today's undergraduates. I have to admit it does disturb me a bit that they are all so polite and well-mannered. They look you in the eye when talking, rather than mumbling into their shoulders. But when you consider the pressure they are under, their resilience is remarkable. They do their academic work cheerfully and efficiently, producing essays as required. Whatever the negative aspects of coursework, most students know how to produce what looks like their own well-researched written work, to deadline. They party harder than ever - that goes without saying - but they also spend time at the gym. So they look remarkably fit and healthy, if rather tired. Many of them, of course, are also doing sizeable part-time jobs to pay their way through college. Today's version of taking in each other's washing is serving each other drinks in the student union. (Actually the name \"union\" does rather conjure up the days of Arthur Scargill and double-dividend on Thursday. Maybe it is time to change it to the \"Student Mega Centre\" or the \"Student Extreme Mall\".) But in any case, when you add up all the hours, these students are doing so much more than anyone used to. The only possible explanation I can find is that they actually get up in the morning. And how is that possible? The answer, I think, is central heating. In fact, central heating has a hallowed place in academia, or, to be more precise, academic fiction. In David's Lodge's Changing Places, Hilary Swallow, on hearing word that her husband Philip, visiting California, is having an affair, immediately orders central heating for the house. She doesn't see why she should be shivering in Rummidge while her husband makes hay in the Euphoric State. Back in real life, central heating may be responsible for more improvements in the student experience than anything the Quality Assurance Agency could even dream of. Until recently, students outside hall tended to live in crumbling Victorian houses, stuffing socks into the sash windows in a vain attempt to keep out the wind, and secreting their private bathplug under their pillows, so that on the rare days the boiler was working they could have a bath without having to use their heel to keep in the water. In those days of two-bar electric fires and coin-hungry meters, winter mornings were spent in bed. But now, with power showers and radiators that actually come on, students have a choice. And a good number of them are choosing to get out of bed. A smart move, especially in moderation. But with building financial pressure and an aversion to debt, many students will seek to work increasingly long hours. Where will these hours come from? Even students have to get some sleep. Unless they can be encouraged to internalise the Marxist dictum that, in the society of future, there will be no distinction between work and leisure and to regard nights of shelf-stacking at Tesco as their social life, something will have to give. One rather depressing possibility is that we are about to witness the return of that endangered species: the lower-second-class degree. \u00b7 Jonathan Wolff is head of the philosophy department at University College, London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
