The upgrade of at least 100 linear accelerator (Linac) machines across the country will ensure more patients get state-of-the-art treatment called intensity-modulated radiotherapy, which can target the tumour very precisely without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. New machines are more accurate and can deliver a higher dose to the cancer cells, which will reduce the amount of time a patient has to spend in radiotherapy and hopefully increase cure rates. Radiotherapy is an important part of cancer treatment, after surgery to remove the tumour, and cures more people than cancer drugs. The Linac machines used to deliver it are supposed to be replaced after 10 years, but 20% of them in England are older than that. The machines installed in the last decade need a software upgrade, according to Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK. Kumar headed the independent Cancer Taskforce, which drew up the NHS cancer strategy and recommended the investment in radiotherapy machines. \u201cOne of the things we were quite clear about in the strategy was that if you look at the proportion of treatment that is delivered as intensity-modulated radiotherapy across the country, it varies quite widely,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cUptake varies two to three-fold across the country. About half the machines in the country are going to be upgraded in the next two years.\u201d About four in 10 cancer patients \u2013 all those who receive radiotherapy \u2013 will get improved treatment, said NHS England, which amounts to around 130,000 people a year. Cally Palmer, NHS England\u2019s national director for cancer and chief executive of the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, said the money would be forthcoming from the NHS budget \u201cbecause cancer has been prioritised over other things. The decision has been made that we need to get radiotherapy right.\u201d Mia Rosenblatt, assistant director of policy and campaigns at Breast Cancer Now, said: \u201cWe are delighted by today\u2019s announcement of investment into new Linacs: radiotherapy is an essential treatment for breast cancer patients, and upgrades to radiotherapy equipment is much overdue. \u201cHowever, it is still too early to tell if the strategy will be successful and the next year will be the real test of how the strategy will benefit breast cancer patients in England. We will continue to follow progress carefully.\u201d The Royal College of Radiologists said the money was not enough. \u201cAlthough the funding announced is to be welcomed, if the government wishes to achieve world class cancer outcomes by 2020, significantly more investment in radiotherapy services is required at least up to the equivalent level announced for Scotland,\u201d said Dr Jeanette Dickson, vice president, clinical oncology. In March, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced a \u00a350m investment in radiotherapy services. NHS England\u2019s commitment was made on the day it reported on progress in the first year of the current cancer strategy. Exploratory work on how to increase the early diagnosis of cancer patients had been a main priority, said Palmer. Those who are diagnosed early have a better chance of cure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
