The same rainstorm that had bedevilled Cooke and her rivals as they sped around the 126km road race continued to beat down as she stood there, arms aloft, smile splitting her face, while the British national anthem rang out. She looked exhilarated, ecstatic, entrancing. \"Well,\" I said, taking a bite and leaving a significant pause before putting on my best Patricia Routledge impression, \"she could at least have brushed her hair.\" \"What!\" spluttered my 14-year-old stepson, \"She just completed a 78.5-mile road race, I don't think ...\" \"I was joking,\" I said, shaking my knife and fork at him. \"Joking!\" \"Oh,\" he said. And I was. Not a good joke, hands up. But the reason I'd made the comment was because of its incongruity, its obvious sarcasm - the notion that Cooke should have been thinking about anything except her triumph at that moment was patently ridiculous; the notion that she might be thinking about her looks was faintly offensive (and therein often lies the best comedy, although clearly not in this case). Here was a woman who had just battled against the best in the world, who had raced in quite awe-inspiringly nasty conditions - as she said later, they still had two hours to go when the torrential rain began - who had seemed to slip back in the very last leg, to lose momentum, fall away from the leaders, before powering through with such resilience and vigour over the last 200m, that her win suddenly came to seem inevitable. And, indeed, it was. As we watched her through those last bars of God Save the Queen, I realised that another reason I'd made the comment was that it was so long since I'd seen a woman being celebrated simply for what she'd done, that the image had come as some sort of shock to the system. Here was a woman being venerated for her power rather than her femininity, as a figure of absolute achievement and action and ambition. This wasn't about how Nicole Cooke looked, or what her success could sell, or who she might or might not be sponsored by. This was about Nicole Cooke and her will to win. Nicole Cooke and her toughness. Nicole Cooke's actions in the past few hours, not to mention all the hours of work she had put in during every one of her 25 years. And it wasn't long before another image of British female achievement popped up on my television screen. In the women's 400m freestyle swimming, the upper hand seemed to lie clearly with non-British competitors for most of the race, and in the final length it seemed that US swimmer Katie Hoff was bound to take it. At the last second, the 19-year-old British swimmer Rebecca Adlington pushed her nerve and verve and muscle beyond all expectation and cruised suddenly, shockingly, to a fingertip win. The BBC commentators were astounded. \"How on earth did she get Hoff?\" they said. \"Holy moley!\" And if the excitement of Adlington's win - the first Olympic gold for a British female swimmer in 48 years - wasn't enough, there was also the thrill of her teammate, 21-year-old Joanne Jackson, coming in third. As the two young women bobbed, exhausted, at the end of the swimming pool, taking in their triumph, beaming, hugging each other, tears welling in their eyes, it was another moment in which nothing mattered except their stunning achievement. Watching the swimming, tears pricking in my own eyes, I was confused as to why these images were hitting me so hard. Why did they seem so unusual - even unprecedented? I had seen Olympic events before. God knows I had seen people swim and cycle and ride horses. But at this particular moment, for some reason, these images of women seemed more significant than ever. Of course, Olympic events have always been important to female spectators, partly because we see so little women's sport the rest of the time. As we went to press, the only Team GB competitors to have won medals were women, and yet women's sporting achievements are usually entirely overlooked. A recent report by the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF), Backing a Winner: Unlocking the Potential in Women's Sport, offered a stark range of statistics to this effect, statistics even worse than the biggest feminist-pessimist could ever have imagined. For instance, an analysis of all the national daily newspapers over the course of three days in March found that \"just 2% of articles and 1% of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and women's sports ... Just 1.4% of sports photography featured women; and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports' pages, there were more images of models, footballers' girlfriends, the French president's wife and a nun than of sportswomen.\" The outlook wasn't any better when it came to other media. During the same period in March, Sky allocated just three of its 72 hours of sports programming to women's events. And of the 10 sports internet sites the WSFF reviewed, \"there were 367 links from the front page to articles, but just five links went to female sports (1%). There was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites. Out of 129 images (both photos and film) - there were four images of women (3%): Sky Sports did have a film of two female sports presenters, a third image was of [former Big Brother contestant] Kate Lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot, and a fourth image was of an advert for women's health.\" In the face of this, the Olympics represents a rare two-week period in which women's events are allocated almost as much coverage as those of their male counterparts. At Athens in 2004, women represented 40.7% of all the athletes who competed, taking part in 45% of all events. There are still a few areas in which women cannot compete - there is no women's ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, for example, and, as Nicole Cooke and fellow British cyclist Victoria Pendleton have pointed out, women can only enter three events at the velodrome, compared with seven events for the male competitors. But, for the most part, the Olympics represents something close to parity. It is a competition in which we can watch women take on a massive range of challenges - from archery to athletics to one of the most compelling events of this Olympics so far, the women's weightlifting. As the years have passed, more and more events have been added to the female competition; in 1998, women's ice hockey joined the roster, in 2002, women's bobsleigh, in 2004, women's wrestling. And audiences seem to pay the same amount of respect to each event, regardless of the sex of those participating. As Harriet Foxwell, head of communications for the WSFF, says, during the Olympics, there is a real \"team ethos, an interest in what the British team is doing as a whole. There isn't a separation between male and female events.\" In this sense the Olympics is quite different to another sport that gives similar weight to male and female coverage: tennis. I enjoy tennis a great deal, but when it comes to coverage of the women's events at Wimbledon, for instance, there seems to be at least as much focus on what the women are wearing, what kind of shape they're in, how they're styling their hair, who's designing their outfits and whether or not they are grunting, as there is on their actual performance. The women at Wimbledon are fantastic athletes - you only had to watch this year's final between Serena and Venus Williams to recognise that - but they are also often objectified to a worrying degre. As Gina Dessalines, co-founder of the website womensportreport.com, says: \"When you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court, and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court, there's definitely an attitude that they're looking for the feminine shot - those moments when they can zoom in on a woman's legs, for example. And then, in all the tennis coverage, there's the massive interest in fashion. Even the people who are interviewing the women, post-match, will say, 'How are you going to dress for tonight's event?' which is a long way off the point.\" Foxwell agrees. \"What's great with the Olympics is the immediacy of it all - you see the women competing, and then they're on the rostrum straight away, looking incredibly natural, and that's so great to see. When it comes to tennis coverage, there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now - a lot of the promotion around Wimbledon this year concerned parties, for instance, rather than just that specific focus on the sports field.\" The biased nature of the tennis coverage is interesting, and the focus on femininity rather than ferocity is certainly galling, but it has existed in other years too, and has never made the Olympics seem especially more feminist by comparison. In fact, I think, what is making this year's competition so rapturous for women is the contrast of the Olympic coverage with the general media attitude to women over the past four years. The celebrity culture, the reality-show culture, the tendency to venerate women who are presented as airheads, stretches back long before 2004, but it is in the past few years that it has reached its zenith. And it is in the past few years, also, that it has taken its ugliest turn, and we have seen an increasing cultural obsession with women on the verge of a nervous breakdown, women who are clearly in psychological turmoil, in and out of rehab, stumbling along the street, with blood on their face and legs and shoes. The image of women that we have been sold for the past few years has been one in which, at best, we are valued only for our looks. More commonly, it seems, we're represented as broken, bedraggled and bewildered. And it is, most pertinently, against this backdrop that the stars of Beijing 2008 have been performing. Recently our expectations of coverage of women have been lowered, nullified; we have become used to seeing that strange category - celebrity women - pictured constantly, relentlessly, their image before us for no other reason than that they happen to have headed out for a pint of milk with their makeup on skew-whiff. At Beijing we have seen the antithesis of that - we have been treated to the sight of ordinary women reaching extraordinary heights. The women we have been thrilling to aren't in our eyeline because they happen to be the offspring of some 1970s rocker, or because they've bagged a multimillionaire boyfriend. They aren't on screen because they have starved themselves to a size zero - instead, their bodies are a celebration of strength. They are women like Cooke, who grew up in Wick, in the Vale of Glamorgan, and has become the first British cyclist, male or female, to win an Olympic road race. Or like Adlington, from Mansfield, who started swimming at the age of seven at her local swimming pool and says that her motto is to \"have fun, there's no point otherwise\". Or Jackson, who comes from Richmond in North Yorkshire and swims for her local club, Derwentside. These are women whose success is an incredible testament to their strength of will, but also represents something accessible - Cooke has spoken about her memories of getting her first bike, memories which will strike a chord with many a kid, while all those provincial children trotting off to their swimming lessons next weekend can remember the fact that Adlington and Jackson got off to just the same start. Will this Olympics change the way that we see women? It's very early days yet. It has the potential to do so if these notable successes lead to a general increase in the coverage of women's sport, because, as Foxwell notes, visible role models can lead to increased sporting participation, which ultimately can result in increased happiness, confidence and success. Whether this year's event represents a short- or long-term improvement in coverage of women and our achievements or not, we should bask in the next two weeks. Just compare the image of Adlington and Jackson, dressed in their power racing suits, celebrating their success, faces lit up with incredulous joy, with that image of Paris Hilton last week, dressed in a cut-out swimsuit, reclining on a sun lounger, mouthing someone else's words in what was, admittedly, a funny rebuke to John McCain. Straggly hair and all, it's clear which of those images is the most inspiring. Let's take to our sofas and enjoy it. Claire Tolley profiles six British women to watch out for at the Beijing Olympics Heather Fell, modern pentathlon, 25 Fell was ranked fourth in the world going into the games in a gruelling 12-hour event that combines fencing, shooting, a 200m freestyle swim, showjumping and a 3km run. Her training day starts at 5am with a two-hour swim, followed by running or riding before lunch, then shooting or fencing. She was named the British Olympic Association's \"one to watch\" for 2007 after winning silver at the European championship and is hoping for a podium place after setting personal bests in May this year in the swim and the run. The Devon-based penathlete, who graduated from Brunel University, has put a physiotherapy career on hold in her attempt to win Olympic gold and instead works on Friday afternoons in her local pub to keep her grounded. Sarah Ayton, sailing (yngling class), 28 Ayton hopes to win a second gold to add to the Olympic title she won with Sarah Webb and Shirley Robertson in the Athens Olympics in 2004, when their success earned them overnight celebrity and the patronising nickname \"three blondes in a boat\". Now with Ayton at the helm with Webb and new crew member Pippa Wilson, the trio came to Beijing having won back-to-back world championship titles and the test event at the Olympic sailing venue in Qingdao. Ayton, who started sailing at the age of six, is engaged to British windsurfer Nick Dempsey, who won bronze in Athens. The pair, who will marry in October, have agreed that if one of them wins the gold here they will have the right to keep their name. If both win gold, their surnames will be double-barrelled. Debbie Flood, rowing (quadruple sculls), 28 Yorkshire-born Flood won silver four years ago in Athens and hopes to go one better this time with her crew of Frances Houghton, Annie Vernon and Katherine Grainger. A devout Christian, she excelled at athletics as a teenager and was selected for the national youth squad at judo, but a chance session on a rowing machine at her father's gym revealed a talent for the sport. After a summer course with Tideway Scullers at Eton College aged 16, she opted to pursue rowing at the highest level. Whatever happens in Beijing, though, she will quit the sport for a year to work full-time in the prison service before returning to train for the 2012 games. Shanaze Reade, cycling (BMX), 19 The Crewe teenager is the favourite to win gold when BMX makes its Olympic debut after cruising to victory in this year's world championships. Nicknamed \"Speedy Readey\", she beat all male competitors to become British No 1 in 2006. She made her seniors debut the following year, becoming women's world BMX champion and winning the world team sprint track title with Victoria Pendleton. When deciding what GCSEs to take, she got a phone call. \"My coach rang to say BMX had been introduced to the Olympics. That was it. I'd wanted to be an English teacher but you can go back to college. You can't go back to being an Olympic gold medallist.\" Beth Tweddle, gymnastics (asymmetric bars), 23 The South Africa-born gymnast has endured a tough time in the games, missing out on the floor final and struggling into the bars final in eighth place as she recovers from a rib injury. With the final next Monday, however, Tweddle will be hopeful of conjuring a performance to match the quality that made her world and European champion in the discipline two years ago. Beijing will be Tweddle's final Olympics - she is planning a career in physiotherapy when she retires after next year's world championships having combined training six hours a day, six days a week, with studying to complete a sports science degree last summer. Kelly Sotherton, athletics (heptathlon), 31 In Athens four years ago, all eyes were on the defending champion, Britain's Denise Lewis, but the surprise medallist was the then 27-year-old Sotherton, ranked only 21st in the world. Moments after winning bronze, Sotherton was in tears after her and Lewis's coach, Charles van Commenee, branded her a wimp for not running quick enough in the 800m to win silver. The tears dried and Sotherton, an outspoken former debt collector, admitted Van Commenee was absolutely right. With the Olympic champion Carolina Kluft deciding not to compete in Beijing, Sotherton knows she has to grasp a last chance for Olympic gold - providing she can overcome her jitters in the javelin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
