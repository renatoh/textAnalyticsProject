Dr Harold Bornstein told NBC News that Trump\u2019s then bodyguard Keith Schiller and two others turned up at his office in February 2017 in an episode that left him feeling \u201craped, frightened and sad\u201d. The incident took place two days after Bornstein, who had been Trump\u2019s New York doctor for more than 35 years, revealed that he had prescribed Propecia, a drug to combat hair loss in men. On Tuesday Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended the move. Asked about Bornstein\u2019s characterisation of it as a \u201craid\u201d, she replied: \u201cNo, that is not my understanding.\u201d Sanders added: \u201cIt would be standard procedure for a newly elected president\u2019s records to be in possession by the White House medical unit. And that was what was taking place, is those records were being transferred over to the White House medical unit as requested.\u201d Bornstein, 70, told NBC News that he was not given a form authorising him to release Trump\u2019s records and that Schiller, along with Trump Organisation lawyer Alan Garten, took the originals and copies of Trump\u2019s charts and lab reports, including records filed under pseudonyms. The doctor said he was speaking out now after seeing reports that Ronny Jackson, allegedly known as \u201cthe candy man\u201d for loosely prescribing pain medications as White House doctor, will not return to his post as Trump\u2019s personal physician after his nomination to run veterans affairs became mired in scandal and collapsed. Sanders was asked to clarify Jackson\u2019s current status. \u201cHe\u2019s still an active duty navy doctor assigned to the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cBut upon his nomination to the Department of Veterans Affairs as the secretary, an acting doctor was put in his place, and Dr [Sean] Conley will remain there.\u201d Sanders did not explain why, adding only: \u201cDr Conley had already assumed that role, but Dr Jackson continues to be an active duty navy doctor that\u2019s assigned here at the White House where there are a number of doctors that are part of the White House Medical Unit.\u201d The quirky, wild-haired Bornstein and the stiff-backed Jackson appear to have little in common but one thing unites them. In 2015 Bornstein described Trump\u2019s health as \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and said he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. Earlier this year Jackson told reporters that Trump has \u201cincredible genes\u201d and, had he eaten a healthier diet over the last 20 years, \u201cmight live to be 200 years old\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
