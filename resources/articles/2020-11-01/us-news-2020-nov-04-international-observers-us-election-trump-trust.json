A preliminary report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) pointed to systemic weaknesses in US elections, as well as the stress imposed by the coronavirus pandemic and Trump\u2019s calls for an end to vote counting in certain states based on false claims of fraud. \u201cBaseless allegations of systematic deficiencies, notably by the incumbent president, including on election night, harm public trust in democratic institutions,\u201d the report, by the OSCE\u2019s Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the organisation\u2019s parliamentary assembly, said. \u201cWith Covid and so many things changing at the last minute practically for the voter and for the election administration, there was this feeling of unease or confusion,\u201d the head of the ODIHR mission, the Polish diplomat Urszula Gacek, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd then on top of that, you have an incumbent who is doing something we\u2019ve never seen before, casting doubt on the actual process, and making the way you cast your ballot also a political statement.\u201d The OSCE report pointed to efforts at the state level to adjust voting procedures in light of the pandemic, and then the raft of legal challenges to those adjustments (overwhelmingly from Republicans), as being a source of considerable confusion when it came time to vote. \u201cThere was an unprecedented volume of litigation over voting processes in the months before the elections, with over 400 lawsuits filed in 44 states, some still before the courts a few days before elections,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe legal uncertainty caused by this ongoing litigation placed an undue burden on some voters wishing to cast their ballots and on election administration officials.\u201d The issues caused by the pandemic and an erratic president compounded long-term systemic problems, the OSCE found, many of which disadvantage the poor and ethnic minorities, such as the varying requirements for proof of identity at polling stations, which the report found to be \u201cunduly restrictive\u201d for some voters. \u201cIf the only thing you could possibly use would be a college student card and you\u2019re not a student, or a driving license and you don\u2019t drive, or a passport and you never travel anywhere, you can imagine that certain economically disadvantaged groups will be disproportionately affected, and certain ethnic minorities could be excluded,\u201d Gacek said. The report also referred to the disenfranchisement of felons and former felons. It said: \u201cAn estimated 5.2 million citizens are disenfranchised due to a criminal conviction, although about half of them have already served their sentences. \u201cThese voting restrictions contravene the principle of universal suffrage,\u201d the report concluded. Gacek said that $400m federal emergency funding for states\u2019 election administrations had not been sufficient and the shortfall had come from private sources. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, contributed $400m. \u201cBut when you look at the $14bn which has been spent on the campaign, and you juxtapose that against an administration which has been having to rely on philanthropists to help them actually run the election, I think it\u2019s interesting,\u201d Gacek said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
