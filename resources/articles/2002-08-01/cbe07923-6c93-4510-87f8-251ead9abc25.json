All the balls have been plucked, all the tortuously bad gags have been made and the draw for the first round of the Champions League is complete. It's a mixed bag for the English contingent with Manchester United drawn against last season's losing finalists Bayer Leverkusen, Liverpool facing Valencia and Newcastle taking on Juventus. Arsenal have arguably been dealt the most favourable hand and vice chairman David Dein said his club were looking forward to their fixtures against clubs they have had little experience of playing against. \"We have never played Borussia Dortmund before or PSV, apart from in a pre-season game,\" he said. \"We have played Auxerre before in the Cup Winners' Cup, when we beat them, thanks to Ian Wright. \"I would like to think we have the squad capable of winning the competition. It is the one competition that has eluded us when considering what we have won. \"There is that extra pressure to see how well we can do in Europe - but we have got a strong squad and hopefully they can deliver.\" As well as Bayer Leverkusen, Manchester United are joined in group F by Olympiakos Piraeus of Greece and Maccabi Haifa, the first Israeli side to reach the lucrative Champions League. Spartak Moscow and Basel complete a tough group B draw for Liverpool. \"I am very happy about the draw. It is the competition we want to win having lost two finals and we are still hoping that we can win the final this year in Old Trafford,\" said Jaime Orti, president of Valencia, who were losing finalists in 2000 and 2001. Meanwhile Newcastle face a tough challenge in group E having been drawn with last season's Uefa Cup winners Feyenoord and Dynamo Kiev as well as Italian Champions Juve. Other highlights of the draw included the pairing of Bayern Munich and AC Milan, who have won the European Cup nine times between them, in a group of death with Deportivo La Coruna of Spain and RC Lens of France. Deportivo coach Javier Irureta was not optimistic about his side's chances of progressing. \"Phew, it is an incredibly strong group, let's see if we can get out of it. Bayern are very strong at the moment and have already played three league matches so it is an exceptionally tough opener against them. Bayern chairman was rubbing his hands in anticipation of sell-out crowds at the Olympic stadium in Munich. \"I'm personally really looking forward to the game against Milan, with Rivaldo and Co in the Olympic Stadium. It'll be a sell-out,\" Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of Bayern Munich. Nine-times winners and defending champions Real Madrid take on AS Roma in group C which also contains AEK Athens and rank outsiders Genk of Belgium. \"I have to admit it could have been much worse and we could have drawn stronger teams so we can't complain,\" said Real Madrid general manager Emilio Butragueno Barcelona should qualify comfortably from group H where they play Galatasaray, Lokomotiv Moscow and Club Bruges. \"At first sight it appears an easier draw than last year so we are quite happy,\" said Anton Parera, Barcelona's director-general."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
