Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Jack Kerouac\u2019s On The Road changed dylan37. Here\u2019s why: Recently had one of those brilliant moments that any literature loving parent will treasure. My youngest son, 16, expressed an interest in what\u2019s on my book shelves, and asked for some recommendations. Where to start? Anywhere; excited, energised and thrilled. I read On The Road straight through one hot summer night when I was 16. I finished the last few pages as the early blue morning arrived gently. And I was changed. The book had an amazing effect on me, and I dedicated the next few years of my life to travelling, experiencing, writing, being, and living what I thought life was all about to the absolute maximum. I\u2019ve read it a few times again over the last 30 years, and my attitude to it has changed considerably. I\u2019m aware now that it was always out of time and out of step; a book popular in the 60s, written in the 50s about the 40s. I came to it in the 80s. There are still breathtaking passages of sparkling writing, wonderful imagery and a unique energy and beat. But Dean Moriarty is no longer a hero, and a bit of life experience showed me how callow, false, duplicitous and selfish he was - dying a drugged up death on the railroad before middle age - a dismal end to a life of taking everything and giving nothing. And Sal Paradise was an observer, hanging around and only ever half taking part. Kerouac, himself, died at 47, after years of bitter alcoholism and living with his mother. I still think it\u2019s one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and my changing attitude and reaction to it and its story won\u2019t diminish that greatness. I\u2019ll be fascinated to learn what my 21st century boy makes of it. We\u2019ll be fascinated to hear about it here too. Elsewhere, 25aubrey has just finished William Peter Blatty\u2019s The Exorcist: Never thought I\u2019d say this, but every page is as good as every scene in the movie. Powerfully gripping, one of those rare books that become welded to your finger tips. \u201cVoluptuousness rampant\u201d now, as vermontlogger reports on Zola\u2019s Nana: It\u2019s a highly coloured story of voluptuousness rampant, hurricanes of extravagance, and unhesitating deception all round, with not one honest character, except at moments Nana herself - superbe fille, superbly realized - who is at least forthright about her desires. The writing seems to be freer than in earlier volumes, less drawn from notes, as if it came more easily to him to imagine conversations in the louche world of theatre types and demi-mondaines. This being Zola, there are some very dark passages too, including the final great tableau which neatly ties up a number of story lines amid the noise and alarums of approaching war. \u201cI read Superior: the return of Race Science by Angela Saini in one sitting yesterday,\u201d says gavernism: I was in turns worried, educated, and fascinated by it. Saini takes you step by step through the history of eugenics and phrenology. She shows the worrisome return of certain theories from the late 19th century that seem to be revivified by a cross current of factors. It\u2019s a real thought provoker and I would like to recommend everyone read it, if only to see if you agree with me that it is clearly a timely and possibly timeless book. The \u201csensational\u201d Lady Audley\u2019s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon has impressed SydneyH: The author is often paired with Wilkie Collins, but in style and content this novel is a match with The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Dickens. I think the text is often noted for its plot, but what is probably under-acknowledged is that the prose is gorgeous. I don\u2019t want to say too much, because it is a mystery after all, but this is the best book I\u2019ve read so far this year. Brobat recommends Thomas Mann\u2019s Buddenbrooks: Mann\u2019s attention to detail is microscopic, not only does he take you on a voyage into the human history of history a family\u2019s life, but the circumstances in which it lives - right down to the design of the upholstery of the furniture. You may think this rather dense stuff, but once you get all these details, you get drawn into the fabulous world which Mann depicts. Finally, let\u2019s hand it over to Besonders who has written an extraordinary summary of War And Peace: This book is very similar to Pride And Prejudice, if Jane Austen had written Pride And Prejudice for an Eastenders storyline, with all the characters belonging to high society, fretting about Brexit, and if all of Europe and its neighbours were trying to settle Brexit by battles between their armies and coalitions of armies. The novel is divided into five books, each book divided into three or four parts, each part divided into chapters of two or three pages. My copy is 1212 pages long, not including the epilogues. Book three, part one, chapter seven ends with \u201cAnd then the war began\u2026\u201d Literally \u201c\u2026\u201d \u2013 like a sequel is in production. In my copy that\u2019s on page 672. Book three, part two, chapter 29 ends with \u201cThe first shots\u201d. That\u2019s on page 845. That\u2019s 173 pages between the war beginning and the first shots. (Well, the first shots that are part of the novel\u2019s action). And all 173 pages are brilliant. Fantastic. Makes it sound like the book isn\u2019t long enough\u2026 Interesting links about books and reading \u201cI\u2019m a grammar-school boy, I do my homework.\u201d Geoff Dyer on the art of non-fiction.
