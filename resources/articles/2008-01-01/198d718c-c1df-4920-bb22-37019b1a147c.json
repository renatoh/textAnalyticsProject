The Schools Quiz PS2, \u00a324.99 (\u00a339.99 with 4 buzzers), Cert 3+ Sony, 4/5 This new addition to the Buzz! series offers edutainment at its best. Moulded by Key Stage 2 teachers to test children's curriculum knowledge, general Buzz! enthusiasts shouldn't dismiss this, as the gameplay follows the winning format and is just as enjoyable - albeit a tad simpler - for all. Quizzes can be set up with different ages (7-11) and topics in mind, but if played at its highest level, and with all topics from maths and science to religion and languages enabled, you'll find it's an enjoyable general knowledge game. The competitor in you will come out, and with rounds such as Fastest Finger, where speed is of the essence, and Top Rank, where you need to put answers into the correct order, you'll discover it's another great Buzz! title simply backed up with additional educational benefits. This game is a great way for both teachers and parents to make learning fun, and to become more involved in the learning process. Pit your knowledge against your children if you dare. Keri Allan Ghost Squad Wii, \u00a329.99, cert 16+ Sega, 3/5 Console conversions of coin-op games always create a good first impression, since they don't need to be fed with coins. And the Wii seems particularly well suited to arcade shooting games like Ghost Squad, thanks to the Wii Remote (indeed, a Wii Zapper would be a good investment if you like such games). A purist, while admitting that Ghost Squad is fun, would scoff at the cheesy dialogue, although the occasional chance to choose your path and the presence of passages of varied gameplay (such as knife and fistfights, bomb-defusing and sniping) add interest. Up to four people can also work co-operatively through the missions. However, Ghost Squad is unforgivably short, with a mere three missions - when you complete one, you then must do it all again, only on a higher difficulty level. Cheap and fun, but also too basic and insubstantial. Not exactly a must-buy. Steve Boxer Geometry Wars: Galaxies DS, \u00a319.99, cert 3+ Kuju/Sierra, 4/5 Geometry Wars is an old-school shoot-em-up where the usual aliens have been replaced by geometric shapes. It harkens back to the vector-graphic games of yore, with the added benefit of being able to cram more of these simple enemies onscreen without the DS's teeny processor grinding to a halt. Each stage consists of between three and nine planets which must be cleared of shapes, gathering any upgrades before they disappear. Use them to beef up your ship or build defences and prepare for the next wave. It's little more than Asteroids 08, to be honest, but in small doses it's still surprisingly addictive.
