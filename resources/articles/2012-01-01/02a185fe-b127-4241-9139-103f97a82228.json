Let's call her Caroline. The National Indoor Arena is stadium-large, and this had nothing like the pyrotechnics it takes to get a stadium roaring. The set was nothing more than a raised central podium, some white festoons, a few chandeliers, and a big (but not what you'd call majestic) glitter ball. It reminded me of those Christmas shows for kids, where they adapt a popular book for the stage; and because the audience is all under five years old, they make no more effort with the set and costumes other than giving the cast some giant ears. One gigantic take, in other words. \"It's usually the dresses that take centre stage,\" Caroline explained. \"Because in my head, I'm swirling around in that dress.\" So anyway, because of the demographic (not making any personal remarks, we're not what you'd call under-five), because it's not Kylie, because it's part way between showbiz and panto, everyone takes a while to warm up. There is a bit of silliness on giant screens at the start, a pre-film of Kate Thornton and the judges, going \"are you ready?\", under the most savage lighting the human face has ever endured. Robbie Savage and Katya Virshilas take the first dance. He is a heavy-footed chap, she a professional dancer, and just about the only intersection of their physical skillset is that he can pick her up. He does that quite a lot. I think originally, maybe in the 1950s, this would have been considered sexy, but it's travelled so far from its original purpose that it's now much more technical than suggestive. At one point she had him in a headlock, using only her thighs. It looked like a self-defence move, although it was hard to pinpoint the aggressor. They say, don't they, that golf is the ruination of a nice walk, and a celebrity is the ruination of a proficient dance. By the same principle, though, some people really like the celebrities. Nancy Dell'Olio has a kind of anti-rhythm. She's so off she must be doing it on purpose. People love her. Mark Foster has Savage's hopeless physical directness, the kind of Olympian unstoppability that is pretty well the opposite of dancing. People love him. Harry Judd \u2013 the 2011 series winner \u2013 is actually quite good, but he's the drummer from McFly. He's not Fred A-bloody-Staire. \"It's because he's a drummer you can see the beat going right through his body,\" says Caroline. So what's the point? Unless you're beyond fandom and into fetishism, does this have a point, if you've already seen the series? Yes, sort of, I think it does; periodically the professional dancers will dance professionally. They're incredibly good. They're constantly waving flags made of chiffon, or ripping off their skirts to reveal other, only slightly less capacious skirts. They wear gladiator-inspired heels that make their footwork all the more impressive, and also put you in mind of the physical prowess of the simple gladiator. There are so many weird things about ballroom dancing that only make sense within their own conventions. They're like Republicans. Everybody is making full use of the, ahem, \"live environment\" to make jokes that they couldn't make on telly. Robbie and Mark are veering towards the Chippendales. I mean that in a nice way. Asked in the second half why people should vote for them, Savage gave his hotel room number (509 at the Malmaison, since you ask), and Foster offered to take his pants off. Nancy's second dance was effectively a threesome. Anton du Beke, the most appealing judge, told Robbie, \"You're like a vulture, intent on fisting...\" huh? \"Feasting\" said Caroline. The real competition was to see who could offer to take the most off, using only double entendre and eyebrows. But nothing was so naked as the commerce; even though people had paid good money to be there, they were still inveigled into text-voting, which I thought was tight, the minority donation to Sports Relief notwithstanding. I voted for Chelsee. My auto-correct changed it to Cheese. So there's 25p I'll never see again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
