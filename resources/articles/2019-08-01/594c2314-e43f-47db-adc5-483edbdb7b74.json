Ricci Bartels fell through the cracks in the job market in her early 60s \u2013 too young to retire yet unable to find a new job after retrenchment. After a long career of helping others find work and paying taxes for 46 years, Bartels spent three years trying to live on the $40-a-day welfare payment. \u201cHow would you suggest people like me have a go to get a go?\u201d Bartels asked the panel, citing Scott Morrison\u2019s frequently used slogan. Her voice quavered with emotion as she described her experience on the unemployment payment as the \u201cworst time\u201d of her life, saying it had robbed her of dignity. The Coalition MP Jason Falinski called Bartels\u2019 experience an \u201cextraordinary story\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to go through that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about your personal circumstances to be able to properly comment on it. If the system has failed you personally \u2026 in your particular circumstances, I can only apologise for that.\u201d The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said Bartels\u2019 story was actually quite common. \u201cJust about everybody else in the country agrees that Newstart is unbearable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not working and it desperately needs to be increased to something that\u2019s liveable after over 25 years of not having been increased in real terms.\u201d Goldie then reeled off a roll call of organisations and individuals who support a Newstart increase \u2013 from the Country Women\u2019s Association to business groups and John Howard, whose government froze the payment in 1997. \u201cI am allowed to disagree \u2026 with John Howard,\u201d Falinski said. \u201cI think on this he\u2019s wrong.\u201d Q&amp;A\u2019s host, Tony Jones, asked Falinski whether the government would raise Newstart once it achieved a surplus. \u201cI know there are people on the left who try to characterise this as being about money,\u201d Falinski replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s about saving lives. It\u2019s about moving people from welfare to work.\u201d The independent MP Zali Steggall, who unseated Tony Abbott at the 18 May election, described the low payment as \u201cembarrassing for us as a nation\u201d. The federal Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher had to defend the opposition\u2019s election campaign pledge of merely reviewing the payment. She pointed out that payments weren\u2019t generally reviewed in order to be decreased. \u201cThis is firmly and squarely in the government\u2019s court,\u201d she said. The Australian Capital Territory chief minister-turned-senator reflected on her own experience having to rely on the welfare system while a single mother, after her partner died. \u201cTwenty years ago I went on a social security payment, completely out of the blue and without any fault of my own \u2026 and it gave me a safety net to allow myself to get myself together,\u201d she said. \u201cI think at this point in time we\u2019re saying Newstart doesn\u2019t provide that any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
