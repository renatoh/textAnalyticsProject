The would-be thieves were only four-and-a-half metres (15ft) short of the cash dispenser outside a DVD hire store in Manchester when the roof collapsed as repairs were under way on electric cabling. Astonished builders clambered down into a tunnel leading 12 metres to a concealed entrance in the side of a railway embankment. Electric lights had been rigged down the tunnel along with scaffolding made from wooden poles. Greater Manchester police said the tunnel in Fallowfield must have taken some weeks to construct, with big rocks as well as heavy subsoil along its route. The work was done so secretively that the way the gang disposed of tonnes of soil without anyone noticing remained a mystery. No one was in the tunnel when the roof caved in, but shovels were found neatly stacked beside a wheelbarrow. The design and level of secrecy were on a par with wartime tunnels dug by British prisoners in Germany, notably in the \"wooden horse\" escape in 1943 and the Great Escape in 1944, both from Stalag Luft III camp. A spokesman for Great Manchester police said the area had been sealed off and the tunnel filled with soil and concrete after a search for clues. \"Investigation showed the full length and height of the tunnel and officers are now investigating the attempted burglary,\" he said. The tunnel ran for most of its length below a car park with a major risk of collapse from the weight of the asphalt surface and heavy vehicles standing on it. Work was clearly under way as a line of bags of soil was also found close to the digging face of the tunnel. These have now been used to help fill in the \"Mole Gang's\" handiwork. One of the workmen who found the tunnel said: \"We didn't know what it was at first, so I got down to have a look. It stretched about 20 metres from a railway embankment, then headed towards the Blockbuster cashpoint. They were almost there. \"I wasn't worried about it collapsing while I was down there, they had made a really good job of the supports and even the police were impressed with the workmanship.\" Mick Duffy, from Stainforth Construction, said that his fellow workers were puzzled by the discovery. \"It would appear somebody was tunnelling from outside the site boundary towards the cash machine. \"It's very well constructed, a semi-professional job with lighting, a fresh air supply, and very well shored and lined out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
