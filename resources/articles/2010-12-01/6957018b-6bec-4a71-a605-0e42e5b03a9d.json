John Atkinson reportedly crashed into a rock when he went off-piste at the popular resort of Les Deux Alpes, near Grenoble, while skiing in poor visibility yesterday. A spokesman for the resort said Atkinson, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, had diverted off the La F\u00e9e piste, a blue run suitable for beginners and novices, when the accident happened. He was not wearing a helmet and was skiing behind his son and daughter, who are said to be in their 20s, when the accident occurred at about 2.30pm yesterday. A doctor on holiday who was skiing behind him came to his aid and sent out an alert, but poor weather conditions prevented a helicopter being sent out. A local doctor arrived at the scene and Atkinson was pronounced dead at about 3.30pm. Atkinson, his wife and children arrived at the resort on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the police in Les Deux Alpes said the family were \"in shock\" and too upset to talk about what happened. \"He was skiing with his children on a blue piste at around 3pm yesterday,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It was snowing, and the visibility was not good. He crashed into a rock.\" The Atkinsons had booked their holiday with the holiday company Les Deux Alpes Loisirs. Marie-Claude Berini, from the company's rescue department, based at the resort, told the Evening Standard. She said: \"Mr Atkinson was skiing at 2,400 metres and hit a rock. He was experienced, but you always take a risk if you go off-piste.\" Atkinson's wife, Susan, had decided not to go out with the others and had stayed at their rented flat. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \"We are aware of the death of a British national at the Deux Alpes yesterday and we are attempting to contact the next of kin to offer consular assistance.\" Two Britons died at the resort in March last year. Richard Ryan, 27, and Christopher Lockwood, 28, fell down a ravine after a night out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
