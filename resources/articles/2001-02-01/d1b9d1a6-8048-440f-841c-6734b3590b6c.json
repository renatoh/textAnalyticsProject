Crewe station has always been a haven for those keen to spot the Inter-City Express from Manchester to London but around the corner at Gresty Road, scouts from the Premiership make a regular pilgrimage attempting to spot the latest product of Dario Gradi's school of excellence. David Platt, Neil Lennon, Seth Johnson, Danny Murphy, Geoff Thomas, Rob Jones. All of these players, and more, have been nurtured by Crewe and Gradi during his 18 years here before climbing to a higher level of the game. Hence the presence of representatives from Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton during Saturday's encounter with Graham Taylor's Watford. The reason for their visit was the 17-year-old striker Dean Ashton, tipped to be the next big thing at Crewe. Despite his youth, Ashton is rumoured to have been the subject of a \u00a31m bid by Arsenal. Wisely, Gradi immediately handed the teenager a three-year contract to keep him at the club. The big guns are clearly on to something with Ashton. Partnered by Rodney Jack, the youngster led the Watford back four a merry dance before being substituted to a standing ovation late on. By then, he had scored his second goal for Crewe and sent the scouts home with bulging notebooks. Gradi admits that the player has abundant talent. \"Dean wasn't even born when I came to the club in 1983,\" he said. \"He is a good goalscorer, but it's too early to talk about what he will turn into. \"He has the skill and he's made a good start. He has the ability, but now it's all about how he turns out physically.\" The strapping forward scored from close range after Kenny Lunt's corner had been headed back across goal by Steve Macauley. After twice going close in the early stages, Ashton had earned his goal. As did Jack, Ashton's enigmatic strike partner. His crisp finish from a Mark Rivers cross opened the scoring. The victory moved Crewe further away from the relegation zone, but Watford will have to play much better if they are to make a swift return to the Premiership. On this display, young Ashton is likely to beat Taylor's men to it. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
