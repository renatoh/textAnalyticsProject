Sajid Javid has sought to adopt a tough stance in respect of Begum\u2019s case but he was immediately faced with the prospect of a legal battle as Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for her relatives, said they were \u201cconsidering all legal avenues to challenge the decision\u201d, that had left them \u201cvery disappointed\u201d. Begum was 15 when she left her home in Bethnal Green and is now in a refugee camp in Syria, where she gave birth to a boy at the weekend. The 19-year-old had called on the British people to have sympathy for her and asked to be allowed to return to the UK. But Javid insisted he would do all in his power to prevent her coming back. The Guardian understands the home secretary thinks section 40(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 gives him the power to strip Begum of her UK citizenship. He wrote to her family informing them he had made such an order, believing the fact her parents are of Bangladeshi heritage means she can apply for citizenship of that country \u2013 though Begum says she has never visited it. This is crucial because, while the law bars him from making a person stateless, it allows him to remove citizenship if he can show Begum has behaved \u201cin a manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK\u201d and he has \u201creasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the UK, to become a national of such a country or territory\u201d. Begum has 28 days from when the order was made to appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission against Javid\u2019s interpretation of his powers. The move is likely to prove highly controversial, with legal sources claiming on Tuesday night that the commission had thrown out previous attempts by the government in similar circumstances to strip citizenship. The human rights campaign group Liberty said Javid must observe the \u201cfundamental principles of due process and the rule of law upon which we all rely\u201d, while meeting his obligation to keep the public safe. A spokesman said: \u201cThe government has an array of powers available to it to deal with people suspected of involvement in terrorism \u2013 including the criminal law. Taking away a person\u2019s citizenship is one of the most serious among them and must not be wielded lightly.\u201d He added that the Home Office\u2019s response \u201cmust include a serious look at how a 15 year-old girl was apparently able to leave the country to join a proscribed group without effective action being taken to safeguard her\u201d. On Tuesday evening, a Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIn recent days, the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here. In order to protect this country, he has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless. \u201cWe do not comment on individual cases, but any decisions to deprive individuals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.\u201d ITV News, which published the letter it said was sent to Begum\u2019s mother on Tuesday, said the Home Office had urged Begum\u2019s family to make her aware of the decision, adding that she had a right to appeal. Begum left the UK along with two schoolfriends and her case was thrust back into the spotlight last week, when she declared her wish to return for the sake of her child in an interview with the Times. In a Sky News interview the following Sunday, she said: \u201cI feel a lot of people should have sympathy for me, for everything I\u2019ve been through. You know, I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when I left ... I was hoping that maybe for the sake of me and my child they let me come back.\u201d But Javid made clear his fierce opposition to her return. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons on Monday he said: \u201cCertainly, anyone that went to support terrorism in any way whatsoever, we are not going to risk the lives of any British officials \u2013 soldiers or anyone \u2013 to help them or rescue them.\u201d Javid told MPs more than 900 people had travelled from the UK to Syria or Iraq. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for.\u201d He added that he had the power to ban foreign nationals from the country and to strip \u201cdangerous dual nationals\u201d of their British citizenship. \u201cOver 100 people have already been deprived in this way,\u201d he said. Javid can also use temporary exclusion orders to bar the return of jihadists for up to two years. He said that Britons who do return to the UK \u201cwill be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted\u201d. In the view of the family\u2019s lawyer, the advice that Begum\u2019s Bangladeshi heritage can be used to deprive her of UK citizenship is incorrect. \u201cOur view is that this would be illegal because they would make her a stateless person, in breach of international law. We are surprised the home secretary does not understand international law, or care about international law,\u201d said Akunjee, when the prospect was raised last week. \u201cIf he were to attempt to put such orders on, we would explore all legal options to block his unlawful actions or appeal. If we can get an injunction, we will.\u201d After the decision was announced, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: \u201cMembership of a terrorist group is a serious crime, as is encouraging or supporting terrorism. But Shamima Begum should face justice for those crimes in the UK. \u201cIt is not only hard to see Ms Begum and her baby as constituting a serious threat to national security, but it also seems a huge wasted opportunity. We can learn lessons as to why a young girl went to Syria in the first place; lessons which could improve Britain\u2019s security by helping us prevent this happening again.\u201d The Labour MP, Stella Creasy, said: \u201cHowever horrific her defence of Isis, if the home secretary can start with stripping this woman and her week-old child of their citizenship for his leadership bid, where does it end?\u201d Creasy added that she too would prefer to see Begum dealt with by the domestic justice system. The Conservative chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, who had spoken out against allowing Begum to return, said Javid had made \u201cabsolutely the right decision\u201d. \u2022 This article was updated on 20 February 2019 to note that Shamima Begum was born in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
