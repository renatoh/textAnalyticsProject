The Arsenal manager also suggested if Wilshere stays at the club, the onus would be on him to prove he deserves a new contract. The midfielder\u2019s deal expires next summer. Wenger is under pressure to trim the number of senior players in his squad from 28 \u2013 the Premier League limit is 25 \u2013 but there has been little interest in Wilshere, 25, who is working to regain full fitness after fracturing a fibula last April, during his season-long loan at Bournemouth. Wilshere was sent off for Arsenal Under\u201123s against Manchester City on Monday night, after reacting badly to a late tackle. Wenger has long championed Wilshere, a one-time prodigy to whom he gave a debut at 16. But he has slipped some way down the pecking order and Wenger did not rule out him leaving if the right offer were to come in. \u201cI\u2019m open with Jack,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe have honest conversations. I\u2019m open to what is the best for him. He is at the stage of his career where he needs to play and I can\u2019t guarantee him that today. I think I\u2019m quite open on that.\u201d It has been a sign of how injuries have blighted Wilshere\u2019s star that Arsenal have not made it a priority this summer to tie him down to fresh terms, despite him having entered his final year. Wenger said he wanted to see Wilshere rediscover his best form before he entered into negotiations. \u201cIf he gets back to his best and wants to stay, we have to sit down later in the season,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI don\u2019t rule that out. \u201cYou know how much I love Jack and his talent but today, in the football world, you need to be a consistent presence. What is at stake for Jack is not his quality, his talent or his determination \u2013 it is whether he is a consistent presence at the top. I hope he can manage to do that. Nobody questions his quality.\u201d Wenger offered his sympathy to Wilshere after he felt the red mist come down in the under-23s game against City. \u201cAt my stage and with my experience in football, I can understand his reaction a lot \u2013 especially with what happened to him [with injuries],\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIdeally, he should not have responded at all but when you have gone through what he has gone through, with bad tackles, it was a human reaction. At the moment, Jack is working very hard to come back after his fracture so, overall, another setback would be terrible \u2013 and it was a bad tackle.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
