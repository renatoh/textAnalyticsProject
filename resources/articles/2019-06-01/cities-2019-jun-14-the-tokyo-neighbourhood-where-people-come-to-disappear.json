In the distance, soaring above the rooftops and mesh of overhead power lines is the unmistakable shape of the Tokyo Skytree. But its proximity to the ultra-modern landmark is deceptive. Older men in well-worn tracksuits, baseball caps and plastic slippers clutch cans of early-afternoon chu-hi alcopops, and dozens of no-frills hostels advertise rooms with easily the lowest rates in the city \u2013 clues to Sanya\u2019s status as a Tokyo neighbourhood like no other, but one that is struggling to adapt to irresistible change. In Tamahime park \u201cKatchan\u201d \u2013 an affectionate abbreviation of his name \u2013 is preparing to meet a friend. Nearby, beyond a makeshift tarpaulin home that boasts a flat-screen TV powered by solar panels, men pair up for games of shogi, their chessboard placed on an old filing cabinet. Behind them, a younger man removes all of his clothes and stares into the middle distance. \u201cI\u2019ve come here to drink, chat and enjoy the weather \u2013 sunlight is free after all,\u201d says Katchan, a day labourer who moved to Sanya 16 years ago. \u201cI only get very occasional work, but I\u2019ve stayed here because this is where my friends are.\u201d Katchan is among the last in a line of men who have come to Sanya for hundreds of years in search of jobs, shelter, and a sense of belonging. During the Edo period (1603-1868), itinerant workers who couldn\u2019t afford regular inns elsewhere in the city took advantage of Sanya\u2019s cheap kichinyado lodgings. After the war, it became home to tent villages for people who had been made homeless by US bombing raids. The military-issue tents, donated by Occupation forces, gradually made way for wooden hostels. By 1953, around 6,000 people lived in 100 hostels; at its peak a decade later, the day labourer population had reached 15,000 people, scattered among more than 220 accommodations. But you won\u2019t find Sanya on any modern maps. In 1966, the government ordered the name Sanya to be expunged from official records \u2013 it\u2019s now divided into two districts, Kiyokawa and Zutsumi \u2013 in an attempt to camouflage its association with poverty, alcoholism, violence and the hiyatoi rodosha \u2013 day labourers. These are the men who built modern Japan in the decades after the war: Tokyo Tower, facilities for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the metropolitan expressway and other infrastructure that lay the foundations for the megalopolis of today. But the labourers and their home are undergoing changes that promise to transform the area beyond recognition. Like many other communities in Japan, Sanya is feeling the effects of the country\u2019s skewed demographics. Most of the estimated 1,500 former labourers who live here are in their 60s and 70s, with a small number in their 80s and 90s. As they enter their twilight years, the hostels once occupied by exhausted manual workers have turned into de facto retirement homes for men surviving on meagre pensions and benefits. While violence is rare these days, Sanya\u2019s increasingly diverse inhabitants are dealing with new sources of tension, says Magokoro Yoshihira, the managing director of YUI Associates, a local community development group. The dwindling population of ageing labourers has an uneasy co-existence with established families who run factories and other small businesses, together with a rising number of younger people on benefits and foreign backpackers who stay at about 20 of the area\u2019s 140 hostels, attracted by clean and comfortable rooms for a little over \u00a52,000 (\u00a315) a night. While travellers have softened the area\u2019s image, a modest form of gentrification is also underway. Local authorities have long resisted major commercial developments, but they are powerless to prevent private landowners from demolishing their ageing hostels \u2013 many of which are considered a fire risk \u2013 to make way for more lucrative apartment blocks. \u201cI can understand the landowners\u2019 thinking,\u201d says Yoshihira, \u201cThey believe they can make more money that way. But it\u2019s not just changing the landscape. It means the area is slowly losing its old atmosphere. Sanya isn\u2019t like other parts of Tokyo, so we need to retain some of its original feel.\u201d There are frequent complaints about noise, drunken behaviour, rough sleeping and, the most common gripe - piles of litter, according to Yoshihira, who says Sanya\u2019s unlikely mix of inhabitants exist in a state of \u201ccold war\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s turned into an \u2018us versus them\u2019 situation,\u201d says Yoshihira, who runs three hotels in Sanya, two for backpackers and one for welfare recipients. Last year, her group opened Sanya Caf\u00e9 to encourage residents and visitors to mix over reasonably priced food and drinks. \u201cThe cafe\u2019s name is our way of taking back the Sanya name,\u201d she says. \u201cThe former day labourers should be proud of themselves \u2013 they\u2019re the men who rebuilt Tokyo, after all. But Japan as a nation has forgotten about them, and people around here are too quick to look down on them. We\u2019re trying to show that diversity is a good thing, and that there\u2019s nothing good about putting other people down to make you feel better about yourself.\u201d Every Friday, Yoshihira and her colleagues encourage former labourers to join them collecting rubbish in exchange for a meal or drink at the cafe. \u201cWe eat together and chat, and it gives everyone a sense of belonging,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the same time it\u2019s important for Sanya to prepare for the next stage in its history.\u201d That future is looking increasingly uncertain for former casual labourers who, forced to leave their condemned hostels, must either find another or be placed in state-subsidised housing, often in distant parts of the city. Some, like \u201cAizawa-san\u201d \u2013 a Sanya resident, on and off, for three decades \u2013 simply end up spending occasional nights sleeping on the street. The 64-year-old is preparing for an afternoon looking for discarded aluminium cans that he will load into a sack on the back of his bicycle and exchange for cash \u2013 \u00a5100 for every kilogram he collects. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money left, which is why I have to collect cans,\u201d says Aizawa, who complains that there is little left of his state pension once he has paid for hostel accommodation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of changes over that time. There used to be riots, but it\u2019s a more peaceful place these days, probably because we\u2019re all too old to fight. Life is hard, but I can be a free spirit here.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
