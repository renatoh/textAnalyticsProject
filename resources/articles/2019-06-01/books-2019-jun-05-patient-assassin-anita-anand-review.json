That primary job done, he took aim at other members of the platform party and wounded Lord Zetland, the secretary of state for India, Sir Louis Dane, who had been O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s predecessor, and Lord Lamington, a former governor of Bombay. This grand assembly of old India hands had just finished their discussion of Afghanistan and the threat posed to it by Germany\u2019s then ally, the Soviet Union. They were relaxed and unaware of any danger; a better-equipped assassin would have made a clean sweep of all four. But the gunman, Udham Singh, had somehow managed to acquire the wrong calibre bullets for his Smith &amp; Wesson; O\u2019Dwyer alone died because he was shot in the back at point blank range and, as the first target, he had no time to defend himself. But O\u2019Dwyer was the only victim Singh cared about \u2013 the rest were a bonus in a long-delayed act of revenge that had its origins more than 20 years before, when on 13 April 1919 troops led by General Reginald Dyer fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians in the city of Amritsar, killing either 379 (the official figure) or more than 1,000 of them (the unofficial estimate of the Indian National Congress). Indian fury at the slaughter extended well beyond the nascent independence movement, and the relationship between the rulers and ruled lurched into what became an unstoppable decline. The broadcaster Anita Anand had a grandfather who could recall scenes from that terrifying day a century ago, but her book\u2019s preoccupation is the aftermath: how a low-born Sikh murdered a country-born Irishman in the august surroundings of imperial London. In this story, very little is predictable. O\u2019Dwyer, one of 14 siblings born to a Catholic farmer in County Tipperary, is hardly the conventional idea of a senior Raj administrator. Singh, flamboyant enough to find work as an extra in Alexander Korda\u2019s Elephant Boy (where he appears in a corner of the Indian jungle created by the Denham Studios in 1936), refuses to conform to typical characterisations of the lone assassin. In Anand\u2019s narrative, the courses of two lives separated by a gulf in race, class and geography narrow slowly until they meet each other, momentarily and theatrically, on stage in front of a London audience. Hitchcock might have made the film. At first glance, neither Singh\u2019s choice of victim nor the source of his motivation is obvious. O\u2019Dwyer was 30 miles away in Lahore, the provincial capital, when General Dyer ordered his troops to fire, and nothing suggests that Singh was a witness to the slaughter. O\u2019Dwyer, however, got up to some bloody mischief of his own the next day when he ordered RAF planes to bomb and machine-gun what he wrongly identified as a rebellious mob in another district of Punjab, while a telegram to Dyer left no doubt that the lieutenant governor approved of the general\u2019s action in Amritsar. The Indian members of the official inquiry into the whole tragic debacle issued a minority report that castigated O\u2019Dwyer for his assumption that Punjab was on the brink of revolt, arguing that the massacre had been precipitated by his overreaction. That didn\u2019t moderate O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s views in any way. He continued to support Dyer long after the general resigned and never stopped publicising his belief that the massacre had prevented widespread rebellion. He was a die-hard. He believed that Indian nationalism should never be appeased and that threats to the status quo needed to be punished severely. When Dyer, for long a sick man, died in his West Country cottage in 1927, O\u2019Dwyer was left as the massacre\u2019s most prominent apologist and a good replacement as its chief culprit. What isn\u2019t at all clear is when Singh resolved to kill him. Anand gives the impression that he swore vengeance on the day of the massacre itself or soon after. She has a puzzling passage in italics, no other author credited, which reads like a historical romance: Singh \u201ctook a handful of blood-soaked earth in his hand \u2026 and he swore a terrible vow \u2026 No matter how long it took, no matter how far it took him \u2026 he would track down the dogs who did this to his people and kill them.\u201d In fact, no firm evidence places him at the scene of the killings or anywhere else in Amritsar in April 1919. Perhaps Anand intends only to show how popular Indian history would like to see Singh, or how Singh would have liked to see himself. Certainly the earlier that Singh\u2019s resolve can be shown to take hold, the more the book\u2019s title can be justified, though given the shortage of information about his intentions for most of the period 1919 to 1940, a more accurate title might have been \u201cThe Wandering Assassin\u201d. What Anand provides about his state of mind is reasonable biographical speculation; all we know for certain is that he moved about the world like an adventurer. Born the son of railway crossing-keeper in rural Punjab and raised in an orphanage, Singh left India for the first time during the first world war, when he joined the Indian army\u2019s expeditionary force to Mesopotamia as a carpenter. Lowly jobs in India followed, and then he went off again to work as a labourer on the Uganda Railway in East Africa. He travelled to England via France and eventually to Mexico, where he settled in El Paso for a time until in 1924 he was smuggled across the US border and into California. It was here, under the tutelage and occasional subsidy of the revolutionary Ghadar movement, that Singh seems to have discovered his vocation as an anti-Raj propagandist. According to Anand, the Ghadars sent him on tours to continental Europe and the Soviet Union, and eventually to the UK, where his multiple aliases and addresses and his trip to Russia soon made him of interest to the authorities. In 1936, a Scotland Yard memo noted that he was believed to be \u201cco-habiting with a white woman somewhere in the West End of London and working at intervals on \u2018crowd scenes\u2019 at film studios\u201d. He began to be followed everywhere by two policemen in plain clothes. Other Punjabis who had settled in London were often pedlars \u2013 door-to-door salesmen of household goods \u2013 and he made friends with several of them. They noticed his boldness \u2013 his irreligiousness, his pub going, his white girlfriends, and how he would sometimes speak to the detectives who were trailing him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home to your family? Don\u2019t waste your time on me. Honestly, I promise I will be a good boy.\u201d In Anand\u2019s phrase, he adopted a \u201cPunjabi prince\u201d persona. And yet somehow the police lost sight of him. His trial at the Old Bailey in June 1940 lasted only two days. Worried about its effect on Indian and foreign opinion, the British government determined that it should attract as little publicity as possible. The number of reporters attending was to be limited; all press messages to India and America in particular were to be carefully scrutinised; censors in India were to be put on their guard against any rhetorical \u201cheroics\u201d that Singh might indulge in the dock. In the event, it was Reuters who supplied most of the copy from the trial, and Reuters had agreed to omit anything that could be described as incendiary in the political sense, and to make no connection between the massacre of 1919 and O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s assassination. Helpfully to the government\u2019s purpose, Nehru and Gandhi and other Congress leaders found the murder inconvenient to the policy of peaceful cooperation they were then trying to pursue. Gandhi declared it \u201can act of insanity\u201d. Singh sank below the waves of wartime news as a solitary killer unconnected to history, perhaps a little mad. He was hanged at Pentonville prison \u2013 a shamefully bungled execution by a nervous hangman, so Anand has discovered from documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Her book isn\u2019t perfect. There are some jarring Americanisms \u2013 \u201cgrunt\u201d for army private, for example \u2013 and in terms of technique an inclination to go beyond the cautiously speculative (\u201cThere is no reason to believe that he would not have helped spread the word \u2026\u201d) into the assertively fictional (\u201cHe took the gun from his overcoat to check it one last time\u201d). But all the same it is an involving account of a strange and obsessive life. \u2022 The Patient Assassin is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320).
