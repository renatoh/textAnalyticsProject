The group was formed in the face of great upheaval: the nation\u2019s former government overthrown, replaced by a socialist regime with an (initially) pro-arts agenda. This new government abandoned ties with the Soviet Union, allowing an influx of American pop on to Somali radio that led to exciting fusion sounds: Chicago soul with Banaadiri beats, Motown melodies with dhaanto grooves. Dur-Dur Band, with their transfixing Somali-disco licks and party-starting spirit, epitomised this new dawn. Tonight, only one founder member is present: bassist Abdillahi Ujeery, plus keyboardist Mohammed Karama who joined a later version of the band, along with others making up the numbers. But even if this is a somewhat ersatz version of the band, they sound as invigorating as they did back then, when they\u2019d perform energetic sets as house band at Mogadishu\u2019s legendary Juba Hotel. Their music never travelled far beyond Somalia in their heyday, were unknown in the west for decades, until reissues of their music on cult labels Awesome Tapes From Africa and Analog Africa, leading to a resurgence. It\u2019s a spotlight the group never thought they\u2019d have, and tonight they seem determined to savour it. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to get back what we lost,\u201d says their manager, introducing the seven-piece to the stage before they begin fizzing through intoxicating Technicolor floor-fillers from their five-plus albums. Tracks such as smoky reggae slink Diinleeya let the band riff joyously over each other, exploring grooves like deep-sea divers. Most in the room have only heard these songs as they were recorded: lo-fi and crunchy. Tonight, aided by the energy of guest vocalist Fadumiina Hilowle, every note is clear, electrifying, alive. Awesome Tapes From Africa and Analog Africa have led to a new lease of life for artists from the continent whose music has gone unappreciated, landing tours for the likes of Ethiopia\u2019s Hailu Mergia and Ghanaian dance enigma Ata Kak, who were released on the former label. Dur-Dur Band prove this evening they\u2019re every bit as life-affirming as their label mates, climaxing in a cacophony of Somali funk excellence that\u2019s met with roars of applause. Though this may not be the band from the original recordings, theirs is a time capsule well worth unearthing. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 20 June to acknowledge that this touring version of the band only contains one original member."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
