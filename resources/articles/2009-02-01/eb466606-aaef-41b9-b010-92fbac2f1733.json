The pirate Bay people have launched a subsite to provide information about the trial at http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ and they're holding a big press conference on Sunday. Ars Technica says: The Pirate Bay won't speak to just anybody. Models of upright social behavior themselves, the site's backers can't waste their time with \"people who really just can't behave.\" They also \"do not speak with assholes,\" and reserve the right to deny press conference access to anyone \"just having [a] bad attitude.\" Clear enough? If they lose, there's some chance that it would reduce the amount of BitTorrent traffic, which would be a Good Thing. But still, I like their attitude. If they need something else to do, they could come and run Comment Is Free and Guardian comments in general, which would benefit from their robust approach. Times Online kicked off its coverage with a long informative piece by Mike Harvey, Internet piracy trial of the decade to begin, which says: \"The trial is expected to make daily headlines in Sweden, where illegal file sharing is a major political talking point, and will be followed closely on the internet around the world.\" Do you think it's that important? Are you planning to follow the case? (We are.) And will a local Swedish result have much global effect? Update: Here's some of our previous coverage, by Bobbie Johnson, starting August 2007: * How three Swedish geeks became Hollywood's Number One enemy * Is the Pirate Bay going to be shut down again? * Notorious pirate website faces copyright case * Team behind Pirate Bay filesharing site to stand trial in Sweden over copyright infringement"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
