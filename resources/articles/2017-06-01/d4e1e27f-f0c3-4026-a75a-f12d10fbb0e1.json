Presumably she was referring not only to the presence of R&amp;B smoothie Miguel but Chris Martin, with whom she duets on Homesick, a tearjerky piano ballad that pleasingly mixes her smoky mid-range vocal with Martin\u2019s crooning. While that isn\u2019t exactly the slick, Capital FM-ready synth-pop she\u2019s best known for, you can see why Lipa held out. Being that she is a young female singer trying to stand out among the glut of artists ploughing similar furrows, Martin\u2019s presence does add clout to proceedings \u2013 albeit of the John Lewis ad kind. Elsewhere, she\u2019s doing what she does best: New Rules and Hotter Than Hell are infused with EDM and tropical house without sounding too consciously trend-chasing, while Blow Your Mind (Mwah) is an unapologetically in-your-face three minutes of pop that is strong and stylish. Despite a few generic offerings (No Goodbyes is mostly just the singer breathily uttering the words \u201cdon\u2019t go back\u201d on loop), this is a solid pop debut that is high on summery nonchalance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
