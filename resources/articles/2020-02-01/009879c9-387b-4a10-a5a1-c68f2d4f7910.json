Top stories Devastating storms have swept through eastern New South Wales, forcing flood evacuations and leaving more than 100,000 people without power. Residents in low-lying areas near the Narrabeen Lagoon in northern Sydney, and the south-west Sydney suburbs of Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra were ordered to evacuate by the NSW State Emergency Service. Emergency services have been swamped with calls since the deluge set in on Friday, while the extreme weather has caused transport chaos across Sydney. A severe weather warning was issued on Sunday for the entire NSW coast and will remain in place on Monday. Survivors of a Thai mall shooting have spoken of their ordeal. The gunman, a soldier identified as Jakrapanth Thomma, arrived at the mall in Nakhon Ratchasima at about 6pm on Saturday. Driving a Humvee-type military vehicle and carrying weapons and ammunition stolen from an army base, Jakrapanth fired at drivers and pedestrians in the area. Inside the mall, shoppers took cover behind counters and inside bathrooms and stockrooms. Thailand\u2019s prime minister has denied suggestions that arms were not properly secured at the military base where the rogue soldier stole multiple weapons before killing 26 people. Disability support pension recipients were increasingly forced to pay back alleged welfare overpayments as the Coalition government\u2019s botched robodebt scheme progressed, despite repeated claims that the program did not target the vulnerable. As the government faces increased pressure over emails showing it received legal advice the scheme was unlawful, it can be revealed that at least 11,000 disability support pensioners have paid back robodebts in full since 2016, and the value of debts settled in full by these recipients increased by 230% between 2017-18 and 2018-19.

A flight carrying more than 200 Australian evacuees from Wuhan landed in Darwin on Sunday, after being granted delayed clearance to fly from Chinese authorities.

Australian Bali Nine member, Renae Lawrence, has pleaded for clemency for the remaining five members of the group still in prison, as Joko Widodo arrives in Australia.

Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, more than 42,000 men, women and children are forced to remain on the islands until their asylum requests are processed by a system both understaffed and overstretched. Facebook and Twitter have refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to remove a video posted by Donald Trump that was misleadingly edited to show her repeatedly tearing a paper copy of his State of the Union address while he was honouring a Tuskegee Airman and other attendees. Recommended reads After months of fear and cancelled visits, some fire-impacted NSW regions have reopened for business \u2013 and still make a lovely holiday destination, writes Kate Hennessy. Over the Christmas and New Year\u2019s break thousands of holidaymakers were forced to evacuate coastal regions in Victoria and on the NSW south coast. The advice from fire authorities was firm: \u201cIf you don\u2019t need to be here, leave now.\u201d Soon after, the message flipped. \u201cWe need you here, come back!\u201d was the call, as towns reliant on tourism, especially from peak times such as the summer school holidays, suffered an avalanche of cancellations. All the world has become a market, and the status of humans and citizens has declined, writes Thomas Keneally. \u201cWe can laugh when the late Gary Becker, neo-conservative of the Chicago School, defined marriage as a contract between \u2018two utility maximising agents\u2019 in which \u2018love as default\u2019 is identified as a \u2018non-marketable household commodity\u2019. We imagine lovers whispering \u2018you maximise my utility like no on else can, honey\u2019. But our laughter is cheap. When it comes to health, education and welfare, we are no longer students, patients, battlers down on our luck. We are clients of a system.\u201d For years, I could hear my dead father\u2019s voice in the telephone weather service. Then it shut down, writes Matthew Ryan. \u201cI had avoided listening to the weather service, hearing it only briefly not long after Dad died. Mum had dialled the number and played it on speaker. I heard a few words of the familiar voice as I made my way out the door. Mum denied she called it often, but when we check her phone bill, the number \u2013 1196 \u2013 recurs sometimes six or seven times a day. Dad made most of the recordings \u2013 thousands of individual words and phrases \u2013 after the diagnosis.
