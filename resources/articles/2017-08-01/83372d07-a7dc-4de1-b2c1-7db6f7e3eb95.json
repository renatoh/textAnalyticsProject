Ke\u00efta, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s prime midfield target for this summer, underwent a medical in England on Monday after Liverpool finally reached an agreement with Leipzig over the terms of his transfer. Liverpool are to activate the \u00a348m release clause in the midfielder\u2019s contract \u2013 a clause that comes into effect at the end of this season \u2013 and will also pay a premium to secure the deal now. Barcelona have been among the clubs linked with the Guinea international and Liverpool have moved to ensure Klopp will eventually get his man. Leipzig have steadfastly refused to consider selling Ke\u00efta in this transfer window but have accepted a deal that will allow them to retain the player for their debut Champions League season while earning more than his eventual release clause. The 22-year-old, who had a medical in Wilmslow and later finalised terms at Melwood, will officially become a Liverpool player on 1 July, 2018. He is believed to have agreed a five-year contract. Liverpool hope to follow the Ke\u00efta breakthrough by adding Lemar to their squad, although they have yet to make a bid for the 21-year-old. Arsenal have been long-term admirers of the France international but, having been told by Monaco that the versatile forward would not be sold this summer, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger declared their interest \u201cdead\u201d last week. That has not deterred Anfield officials from exploring the possibility of bringing Lemar to Merseyside. Liverpool have made inquiries with Monaco who, having sold Bernardo Silva, Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko, Benjamin Mendy and agreed Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s departure for Paris Saint\u2011Germain this summer, wish to keep Lemar in the hope of attracting a higher price next year. Liverpool are expected to test that resolve before the deadline with an offer of around \u00a360m, with the Belgium striker Divock Origi potentially heading in the opposite direction. The club also retain interest in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who would be an alternative to Lemar, despite Chelsea agreeing a \u00a335m deal with Arsenal. Virgil van Dijk is another target although Southampton have given no indication they are prepared to sell the defender despite his determination to leave St Mary\u2019s. Dejan Lovren, whose role would be threatened by Van Dijk\u2019s arrival, believes Liverpool showed they are stronger than Arsenal in every department \u2013 the substitutes\u2019 bench included \u2013 when dismantling Wenger\u2019s side 4-0 at Anfield on Sunday. The central defender said: \u201cWe knew this wasn\u2019t Crystal Palace or Hoffenheim coming here, it was Arsenal. They have a lot of quality but we showed that in every position we are stronger than them and it was a deserved win. I don\u2019t even remember them having a shot \u2013 that just shows what a great effort it was from everyone, a real team performance. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the starting XI, look at the bench. [Daniel] Sturridge came on and scored within a couple of minutes. That says a lot about the strength we have. We\u2019ve got Adam [Lallana] and Philippe [Coutinho] to come back hopefully soon, so let\u2019s see what we can achieve.\u201d Leicester City have made an inquiry about Liverpool\u2019s defender Mamadou Sakho, who is also wanted by Palace and West Bromwich Albion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
