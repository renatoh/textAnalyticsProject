Dozens of fatalities have now been linked to cruise ships, with both passengers and crew dying while at sea and after disembarking. Yet, according to analysis using the ship-tracking site CruiseMapper, at least eight ships remain at sea with passengers \u2013 including one vessel on which 128 people have tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cOutbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage,\u201d the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned in guidance prohibiting those disembarking from cruise ships from taking regular commercial flights. It listed 28 cruises that had reported Covid-19 outbreaks and used US ports. Cruise industry representatives say they were caught \u201cwithout warning\u201d by the pandemic. But operators continued to launch cruises as late as mid-March \u2013 after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic \u2013 and companies have been accused of failing to disclose the scale of ship-born outbreaks before allowing passengers to disembark. As far back as early February, outbreaks were detected on cruise ships. The Diamond Princess was quarantined in Japan on 4 February after an outbreak onboard which eventually claimed at least 10 lives. At least six ships which had coronavirus outbreaks set sail from the US after the CDC advised against cruise travel on 8 March \u2013 including two that departed after the WHO\u2019s pandemic declaration. Around the world, the Pacific Princess, Queen Mary 2, Arcadia, Astor, Magnifica, Columbus, Costa Deliziosa and the Greg Mortimer cruise liners all remain at sea. At least 6,362 passengers are onboard the eight ships, several of which were scheduled as months-long, round-the-world voyages. On Saturday, Australian passengers are due to be repatriated from Uruguay after disembarking from the Greg Mortimer, an Antarctic cruise ship on which nearly two-thirds of passengers and crew have been infected with coronavirus. Eight people have transferred to intensive care in Montevideo from the vessel which set sail on the day of the WHO pandemic declaration and has been anchored off La Plata river since 27 March after cutting the cruise short. European and US passengers have been told they cannot disembark until two weeks after they have tested negative for the disease. Brian Meier, 55, a businessman from Chicago, said the worst part of the experience has been the daily uncertainty regarding their fate. \u201cOur mood goes up and down, because we are told there\u2019s news coming \u2013 but then you wake up the next morning and there\u2019s no news and by the time it gets dark again there\u2019s still nothing,\u201d he said via WhatsApp. There are currently no reports of Covid-19 on any of the other ships currently at sea. But the CDC has warned that thousands of passengers who had travelled on 28 cruises since 1 February may have been exposed to coronavirus. Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, called on the US government to devise a plan to safely allow passengers on the remaining ships to disembark. Having cruise ships \u201cwandering the world right now\u201d was \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d, he said. The crisis has increased concerns about whether some cruise operators fully disclosed the scale of coronavirus outbreaks. On Wednesday, a class action lawsuit was filed against Costa Cruise Lines, a subsidiary of Carnival, which operates the Costa Luminosa. At least seven people died after boarding the ship, and the suit \u2013 which has not yet been certified by a judge \u2013 alleges that the cruise should never have started on 5 March due to safety concerns about Covid-19. In Australia, police in New South Wales have launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of Carnival Australia over whether the company was transparent about the scale of the Covid-19 outbreak on one of its cruise ships, the Ruby Princess. Authorities said they had been assured by Carnival Australia that the disease had not been detected on the ship before it docked in Sydney on 19 March and hundreds of passengers were allowed to leave. The Ruby Princess became the country\u2019s single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia, accounting for around a third of deaths. In San Diego, the Celebrity Eclipse was allowed to unload about 2,300 passengers on 30 March after assuring port officials that there was no illness aboard the ship, which had been turned away from a port in Chile. But a woman hospitalised immediately after leaving the ship tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband, David Nystrom, told local television in San Diego that the cruise ship\u2019s dispensary had been overflowing with sick patients for a week. \u201cShe had all the symptoms a week before that ship docked and many other people had the symptoms,\u201d Nystrom said. He said the ship\u2019s medical bay \u201cwas standing room only. I would guess at least 50 people every day sitting in chairs waiting, people sweating, people coughing\u201d. Royal Caribbean, the ship\u2019s operator, did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Florida\u2019s attorney general, Ashley Moody, has announced an investigation into whether sales pitches by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) sought to downplay concerns about Covid-19 \u2013 in one case allegedly telling customers: \u201cThe coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise.\u201d NCL did not respond when contacted by the Guardian. Passengers have also launched individual lawsuits. On Tuesday a couple who were infected on a cruise to Europe filed a suit against Costa Cruises in a US federal court. Three passengers died and many were infected on the voyage of the Costa Luminosa, which left Florida on 5 March. \u201cThis cruise never should have set sail from Fort Lauderdale in the first place because by 5 March 2020 the global cruise industry was well aware of the two Princess cruise ships that resulted in a massive outbreak of the virus and numerous deaths,\u201d said Michael Winkleman, the attorney who filed the suit in a statement obtained by the Miami Herald. Carnival Corporation, which owns Costa Cruises, Holland America Line and Carnival Australia, did not comment on specific allegations in this article. But in a statement to the Guardian, the corporation said both it and its subsidiaries had taken \u201cmore precautions and actions than most\u201d. \u201cWe have only seven out of a fleet of 105 ships with guests who tested positive since last December, when the first case became public. Unlike some, we immediately took action and suspended our cruises in China and later in parts of Asia,\u201d it said. Cruise industry leaders have described the situations facing the stranded cruise ships as coming \u201cwithout warning\u201d from an unprecedented crisis. \u201cThese travellers could have been any one of us or our families, unexpectedly caught in the middle of this unprecedented closure of global borders that happened in a matter of days and without warning,\u201d said Orlando Ashford, the president of Holland America Line, after four died on its Zaandam cruise ship. Cruise Lines International Association, the largest trade association for the industry, confirmed the Guardian\u2019s figures on vessels still at sea and said: \u201cUpon declaration by the WHO of a pandemic, CLIA member cruise lines voluntarily suspended operations worldwide \u2013 making the cruise industry one of the first to do so.\u201d But James Walker, a Florida attorney who specialises in cases involving cruise ship passengers, said the outbreaks on cruise ships around the world were \u201centirely predictable\u201d given there was so little government oversight of the industry. He said the cruise industry should have halted operations much sooner, and also criticised the US government\u2019s response to the crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s been abysmal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems out of control quite frankly. No one seems to have a plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
