Three of these relate to postal votes, one allegation is of bribery and corruption and the fifth is of a breach of the privacy of the vote, Cambridgeshire police have confirmed. The Labour candidate, Lisa Forbes, was elected after the byelection on 6 June, with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party in second place. Postal votes accounted for 9,898 of the 33,998 ballot papers received. About 400 of the postal votes returned were rejected due to either the signature or date of birth or both not matching council records. The byelection was called after Peterborough\u2019s previous MP, Fiona Onasanya, was forced out after she was jailed for lying about a speeding offence. Onasanya was elected as a Labour MP in 2017 with a wafer-thin majority of 607, but was suspended from the party after she was sentenced. On election night, Brexit party sources were briefing that they believed that there were irregularities surrounding the city\u2019s Asian community. Farage went further on Sunday by calling Peterborough a \u201crotten borough\u201d \u2013 and blaming the postal vote system for his party\u2019s loss. He told MailOnline: \u201cI think there is something inherently wrong with the entire postal voting process in this country. I think it\u2019s open to corruption, bribery intimidation, abuse. We\u2019ve seen so many cases now where again and again we find \u2013 particularly in the inner cities \u2013 postal voting is producing the wrong results. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid Peterborough looks like another one of those rotten boroughs.\u201d Peterborough council said on 10 June that it received one unconfirmed report regarding alleged bribery before polling day. This was referred to the police and no further action would be taken, the authority said. Police have been asked to investigate a claim, made on social media, that an individual burned more than 1,000 votes destined for the Brexit party; and that some voters were observed taking photographs of ballot papers, leading to concerns that they were fulfilling some form of contract. It is not known if these claims are part of the latest Cambridgeshire police inquiry. In a statement, the council said that on top of the claims sent to the police, another concern was received on polling day that was also referred to police, but could not be substantiated. The council said it had seen no evidence postal voting fraud had taken place. Labour sources have previously said claims that their campaigners have been involved in electoral fraud are a \u201cracist trope\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
