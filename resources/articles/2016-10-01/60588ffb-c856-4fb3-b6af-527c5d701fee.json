Barwell made the call for pensioners to skip a generation when writing their wills as he revealed that his 75-year-old mother had chosen to leave her \u00a3700,000 house in Croydon to her five grandchildren rather than himself and his brother. The MP for Croydon Central, who owns a \u00a3750,000 house three miles from his mother\u2019s, said the decision could help to reduce intergenerational financial inequities. \u201cGenerally in life we all like to think that our children are going to be better off than us. In terms of new technology and life expectancy, they are going to be,\u201d he told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham last week. \u201cBut at the moment, as things stand, they are less likely to own their own home and we need to do something about that.\u201d However, Barwell added that he did not want to live in a country where it was necessary to have a wealthy grandparent simply to get on to to the housing ladder, the Telegraph reported. In her speech to the party conference on Wednesday, the prime minister, Theresa May, described the UK\u2019s housing market as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and said the \u201cpower of government\u201d was needed to repair it. The average house price in England stands at \u00a3232,885, according to Land Registry figures, with the average in London more than double that figure at \u00a3484,716. Part of the problem is the UK\u2019s failure to build enough houses to meet demand. There were 143,560 housing starts in England in the 12 months to December 2015 \u2013 6% higher than the previous year but still far short of the 240,000 dwellings that need to be built annually. With many would-be home owners forced into the rental market, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) warned last week that the UK faces a shortfall of 1.8 m rental properties unless the government took swift action. The housing industry body called on ministers to reverse stamp duty changes on second homes and consider incentives for build-to-rent schemes, after it found a drop in property investors\u2019 appetite to add to their buy-to-let portfolios."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
