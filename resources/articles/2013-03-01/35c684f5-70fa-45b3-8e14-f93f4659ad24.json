Isco's wonderful opener minutes before the break gave the home side the lead to cancel out Jo\u00e3o Moutinho's first-leg goal before the substitute Roque Santa Cruz scored just four minutes after coming on to seal a famous win. With a four-year European ban hanging over them, this year's competition is all the more important for the Spaniards, who ramped up the pressure after Steven Defour was sent off four minutes into the second half. After a slow start, J\u00falio Baptista headed tamely over from an Isco free-kick in the 11th minute. The first 30 minutes were dominated by bookings with neither side holding back, putting in some strong challenges. Porto's Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was the first to enter the referee's book after 17 minutes, before Mart\u00edn Demichelis, Defour, Alex Sandro and Jes\u00fas G\u00e1mez all joined him in the book. Porto were playing their own dangerous game, holding a high line against a pacy M\u00e1laga forward line. They were lucky the linesman raised his flag in the 27th minute against Javier Saviola after he was sent clear by Defour. Joaqu\u00edn shot over just after the half-hour mark before Vitorino Antunes forced a decent save out of the Porto goalkeeper, Helton, who acrobatically tipped his effort over the bar. Saviola then had a goal ruled out by the referee, Nicola Rizzoli, after Baptista was alleged to have fouled Helton before he spilt the ball to the striker. However, replays showed that the Brazilian was pushed into the keeper by Danilo. M\u00e1laga finally got the goal their pressure deserved three minutes before the break. With few options and nobody closing him down, Isco curled a wonderful effort over Helton and into the top corner to put his side level on aggregate. James Rodr\u00edguez replaced Moutinho at the break as the visitors sought to improve their attacking options. However, just four minutes into the second period they were in trouble after Defour received a second yellow card for a petulant trip on Joaqu\u00edn, whose skill and speed had see him glide past the Belgian. V\u00edtor Pereira reacted by bringing on Maicon for winger Silvestre Varela and switching to three centre-backs, before J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan was booked for a lunge on Lucho Gonz\u00e1lez. Christian Atsu came on for Sandro with 20 minutes left, before Santa Cruz replaced Baptista for M\u00e1laga. And just after coming on Santa Cruz put his side ahead after outjumping Otamendi from an Isco corner to plant his header past a diving Helton. Maicon thought he had put Porto back in front after heading home from a free-kick, but the goal was correctly ruled out for offside as M\u00e1laga progressed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
