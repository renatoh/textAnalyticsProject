Oil prices fell to a fresh 12-year low on Wednesday and metal prices tumbled in response to warnings that China\u2019s slowdown could derail the global recovery at a time when central banks, which came to the rescue in the credit crunch, have only limited firepower. As world and business leaders gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the FTSE 100 was gripped by panic selling, especially of mining and oil companies that have been hit hard by the global slowdown in manufacturing and trade. Earlier this week, China recorded the slowest rate of economic growth for 25 years. The index dropped more than 200 points to finish the day down more than 20% from its peak of 7,122, reached in April last year. Such a 20% decline marks the beginning of a bear market. In New York, shares on the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 249 points down (1.56%), recovering from a 550-point-drop earlier in the day, while Brent crude dropped to $27.78 a barrel \u2013 down by about 70% from its summer 2014 level of $115 a barrel. Stock markets in Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia also dived as concerns mounted that countries already badly hit by the fall in oil prices could be forced to dip further into reserves to prevent an economic crisis. Global equities have had their worst start to a year on record. William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 club, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. \u201cThe situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up. Debts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief,\u201d he said on the eve of the event. The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash. Concerns that the global recovery could be derailed began last summer when a devaluation of the Chinese currency caused a meltdown on the Shanghai stock exchange. A series of economic downgrades to the Chinese and US economies since then, coupled with a rise in US interest rates, have fuelled investors\u2019 misgivings about optimistic forecasts for a recovery in economic fortunes. Adding to the concerns of a sharp downgrade in global growth this year, a survey for the consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers before the Davos meeting revealed that two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats facing their businesses than three years ago. And the head of the Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, turned the screw by warning that the world was stuck in an era of low growth. Last week, an investment analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland advised clients to \u201csell everything\u201d except the safest high grade bonds after warning of a \u201ccataclysmic\u201d year and the strong likelihood of a stock market crash. His comments came after the British chancellor, George Osborne, warned in a new year speech of a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d to the UK\u2019s prospects from an increasingly uncertain world economy. Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist at consultancy IHS, blamed the Chinese authorities for triggering the global panic. \u201cThe big event that I think has captured everyone\u2019s attention is the developments in China and in particular the fact that growth is slowing,\u201d he said. The Chinese policymakers had fumbled, he said. \u201cThey have made some mistakes. And they have added to the uncertainty and the volatility by their behaviour.\u201d Others blamed the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, for raising interest rates in December to 0.5% when growth was already faltering, increasing borrowing costs to US businesses and encouraging an influx of funds, especially from China. However, Nouriel Roubini, who was even more vocal than the BIS in warning of the 2008 crash, said that the threat of a crash was overplayed: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 was going to be a bumpy year until central banks responded with extra stimulus, he warned, saying: \u201cThe big thing that should happen is [that] China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European economics commissioner, said central banks retained some firepower to prevent another crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address,\u201d he said. Maurice Obstfeld, the chief economist at the IMF, said he was concerned that central banks were held back by concerns that an extra stimulus would cause more inflation in a couple of years. \u201cCentral banks should be more relaxed about overshooting their inflation targets and more concerned about deflationary pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in an environment where there is growing concern that inflation expectations are not firmly anchored. So there should be much more concern about deflation.\u201d Among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 were international mining groups, whose business has been particularly hit by the slowdown in China as demand for industrial basics such as iron ore and copper has fallen rapidly. The biggest loser was miner and commodities trading group Glencore, whose shares tumbled nearly 10% to 71p. Less than two years ago, they were changing hands at 375p. Anglo American, the iron ore, copper and diamond miner, lost more than 7%, falling to 221p. Less than four years ago, they were valued at more than \u00a334."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
