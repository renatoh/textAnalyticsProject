Haaretz quotes him as saying that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, had offered nothing \"tangible\" to the Palestinians. Columnist Yoel Marcus said that Mr Arafat was \"green with envy\" at missing out on the handshakes between the three leaders. The Jerusalem Post leads on President Bush's statement that \"we accomplished what I hoped we'd accomplish\", while columnist Mark Heller describes the road map as \"neither panacea nor disaster\". \"Even if violence resumes,\" he writes, \"it will be waged between two states, rather than between occupier and occupied\". The views expressed by Palestinians and Israelis on the bitterlemons discussion forum were even more sceptical. Ghazi Hamad, the editor of Gaza's al-Risala newspaper, currently shut down by the Palestinian Authority, writes: \"While the coming days may see some easing of tensions, it is very difficult to imagine that the road map will endure. There are hundreds of obstacles before the parties, and the road map offers no path for navigating the most sensitive and important issues. \"We have seen George Mitchell, Anthoni Zinni, George Tenet, Colin Powell, and now George Bush come to the region, but none of their approaches worked. \"Prime Minister Abbas will be unable to continue along the road map if there is no pressure on Israel to evacuate settlements here in Gaza, for example, or declare the boundaries of a Palestinian state ... In this, Prime Minister Abbas is making the same mistake the PLO made in 1993 by agreeing to implement the small things now, and ignoring the big problems until later.\" Uri Elitzur, the editor of Nekuda, the official publication of the Jewish settler movement, is equally pessimistic. \"Like the battered wife who returns again and again to her violent husband because \"this time he really promised\" to behave, so the road map takes us back, once again, to a course that always ends up badly. \"But with one difference: this time the violent husband isn't even making empty promises to behave. The empty promise is being made in his name by America.\" The Jordan Times says that, despite Mr Bush's efforts in the Middle East, US credibility is \"on the line\" in the Arab world, particularly in the light of the continuing controversy over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The paper's main editorial praises Jordan's King Abdullah for his role in the summit. It was \"was yet another proof that Jordan might be a small country with limited natural resources, but it can punch well above its weight\". The New York Times believes that the latest push for peace is markedly different to those that have gone before, and signals real change in the Middle East. In the past, its editorial says, \"neither side has tried to grasp how the other feels\", but yesterday's meeting was a \"powerful omen for change\". \"As President Bush told reporters afterwards, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority talked about the suffering of the Jewish people, the Israeli prime minister talked about a Palestinian state.\" The summit also marks a turning point for Mr Bush's presidency, according to Jay Bushinsky in the Chicago Sun-Times. \"Consciously and deliberately, Bush led the United States into an unprecedented involvement in Middle Eastern affairs, expanding his armed forces' control of Iraq to include monitoring of Israeli and Palestinian adherence to the road map's political and geographical guidelines. \"Not since President Harry Truman embraced the UN general assembly's decision to partition Palestine into adjacent Jewish and Arab states,\" continues Bushinsky, \"has an American chief executive played such a crucial role in trying to wind down the centuries-old dispute between Jews and Arabs over the Holy Land.\" For Ramzy Baroud, a commentator in the Palestinian Chronicle, actions speak louder than words. The paper reminds readers that, on the \"historic\" day of the peace summit, \"Israeli tanks attacked the West Bank town of Tulkarm and killed a Palestinian boy. Two children were also wounded in the Israeli attack: one was seven, and the other nine\". \"Sharon's word made no difference to the families of the children killed and wounded, and most likely to millions of Palestinians, who still regard Sharon as a violent leader who holds no respect for their long denied rights. \"Looking back at their experiences with Begin, Rabin, Barak and Sharon himself, Palestinians already know: expressions of peace that are soaked in blood just don't count.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
