But if your past isn't something to advertise, or there are a few skeletons in the filing cabinet, the odds can be stacked against you. IT director Phil Lenham would know. When he was sacked from his first job in banking at 18, he was keen to put the past behind him, but it wasn't as easy as he imagined. \"When I started working at the bank, my colleagues soon told me that they sometimes dipped into the bank charges we took over the counter,\" he says. \"It wasn't much: a pound here and there for your tea money, a bit of extra change for your lunch. Everyone was at it, but muggins here got caught! It was instant dismissal. I decided to go back to college to do A levels, then got a job at an insurance company, without letting on I'd been sacked from my previous job.\" Then he received a call from Human Resources, asking him to attend an urgent meeting. \"They told me there had been some kind of mix up and my references had only just turned up - nearly a year after I'd started the job! They knew I'd been sacked and why. I told them I was ashamed of what I'd done, that I was young and naive at the time, but I'd learned a lot from the experience. My boss was happy with my work and willing to give me a chance. That was years ago and since then, I've moved on several times, but I know I was fortunate to keep that job.\" Nowadays, he might not have been so lucky - especially if, like many job hunters, he was seeking work through an employment agency. The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 stipulate that such agencies have a legal duty to draw their clients' attention to anything they believe might affect a work seeker's ability to do a job - even after they have been placed in that job. \"The bottom line is that honesty is always the best policy,\" says Andrew Smith, human resources manager at employment services company Adecco. \"Even if you manage to gain employment, if you've withheld significant information and your employer finds out, you could be liable to dismissal, landing you in a worse position than you started in!\" Student Matt Phillips graduates this summer. He is concerned that a conviction for assault when he was a teenager will make it more difficult for him to gain employment. He says: \"It's frustrating because I didn't instigate any violence. This man set upon my brother outside a nightclub for no reason. I panicked and hit him. Of course, I regret it. I'm wondering if it would be better not to mention anything about it on my job applications.\" According to Mervyn Barrett, communications manager at crime reduction charity Nacro, doing so is becoming increasingly difficult. He says: \"In the past people with criminal records may have gained employment by not disclosing them. But the introduction of the Disclosure Service means that more employers are insisting on seeing records.\" The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 enables most convictions to become \"spent\" after a fixed rehabilitation period, based on the length and nature of the sentence. Standard and enhanced disclosure checks were introduced in March 2002, providing employers with various levels of information about any criminal record amassed by a potential employee. In certain circumstance - for example, if the job will involve working with children, vulnerable adults or in the health service - convictions which would otherwise be deemed spent under the 1974 Act can also be disclosed. A third level - basic disclosures - looks set to follow in the future and Barrett predicts that many employers will insist on seeing these as a condition of employment in all kinds of jobs. While jobseekers need to be honest about their past, there are many ways of reassuring potential employers, says Barrett. Explaining the context of the crime can be helpful. In Phillips' case, for example, he could explain that his assault was an unpremeditated offence, committed while he was a juvenile. His attitude to it now is also important. Someone who accepts responsibility for and regrets their actions is likely to be considered more favourably. Nacro advises ex-offenders to disclose convictions and to provide whatever reassurance they can - usually within their letter of application. It's acceptable to wait until you have been shortlisted for interview before making the disclosure, but revealing you have a past conviction at a job interview is not a good move. \"News of this kind will probably come as a surprise - and not a pleasant one,\" says Barrett. \"A polite phone call, prior to accepting the interview, should be enough to ascertain whether the employer wishes to continue with the application in the light of the disclosure.\" Whatever is lurking in your past, it is important not to let it overshadow the qualities you have to offer. As Barrett puts it: \"While you clearly need to provide reassurance for potential employers that whatever is in the past is not going to affect your ability to do a job, try not to dwell on this too much. Concentrate on getting the message across that you are applying for the position because you have the necessary skills, experience and qualifications.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
