Reports from the continent have quoted the 24-year-old as saying he wants to return to former club Empoli on loan for the rest of the season in a bid to rediscover the form that persuaded the Middlesbrough to part with a club record \u00a38.15million for his services in July 2002. However, McClaren, who has made no secret of the fact that he will look to strengthen his striking resources during this month's transfer window, has insisted that the Italian international is going nowhere. \"There are no plans to allow Massimo to move on anywhere else, either permanently or temporarily,\" he said. Maccarone, who has also been linked with Perugia, has endured a miserable season so far after struggling to find form since returning from a niggling pre-season ankle injury. He said: \"I just want to play. This is what is important so that next year I will be able to return in the best condition to Middlesbrough. \"I need to play six months in Italy and Empoli would be the ideal solution, seeing as I feel at home there.\" The Teessiders have been persistently linked with a series of big-name frontmen in recent weeks, including Andy Cole and Mark Viduka. However, they have a strict policy on transfer fees and wages and neither the manager nor chairman Steve Gibson will break the bank. McClaren said: \"I think everybody would like to do it as early as possible because, for instance, we've got eight games potentially in January and if you sign somebody at the end of January, that's eight games you've missed out, so you'd like to do business early. \"But I'd probably expect a quiet transfer window. It's been quiet, there's not been much activity. \"I'm not expecting much activity, but we're certainly one club looking to improve our team, our squad, and we're endeavouring to do that. \"It's going to be very difficult to improve what we've already got because of, one, availability and, two, price. \""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
