One T-shirt reads: \u201cWhat part of Kirin J Callinan don\u2019t you understand?\u201d \u201cEvery part,\u201d he confirms dryly to Guardian Australia. The Sydney musician has had \u201ca contradictory and confusing year of mistakes, exaggeration and misrepresentations\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what it says in the press release for his third solo album, Return to Center. But today he\u2019s committed to clearing a few things up in the name of transparency \u2013 an unusual step for an artist assumed to be rooted in provocation and parody. Events kicked off in November 2017, when Callinan lifted his kilt to photographers at the Aria awards in Sydney, and subsequently received a good behaviour bond after pleading guilty to obscene and wilful exposure. His referees for the case included Jimmy Barnes, director Jane Campion and Neil Finn, who described him as \u201cas a person with a penchant for mischief and exhibitionism\u201d. (\u201cIt\u2019s true, I did shoot fairly high with my referees,\u201d Callinan says now.) Finn wasn\u2019t wrong; the exhibitionism wasn\u2019t exactly out of character. Callinan\u2019s penis, or at times just the fluids that emerge from it \u2013 has made cameos on his Instagram account, in the video of SAD and on the gatefold of the vinyl of his second album, 2017\u2019s Bravado. But when the exposure moved from the artist\u2019s own domain to a red carpet surprise, it raised questions \u2013 and concerns \u2013 around consent. Further criticism blew up around that gatefold sleeve, in which he was photographed painted bronze \u2013 \u201clike a bodybuilder homage, the idea of vanity,\u201d he says now. But in the context of recent and overdue discourse about blackface (as well as consent), to many it seemed Callinan was unforgivably thumbing his nose. Opinion pieces by Australian cultural commentators followed, and his appearances at touring festival Laneway were cancelled \u2013 partly at the urging of Miss Blanks, rapper and ambassador of the festival\u2019s safe space initiative. In fact, in Australia, he seemed to be cancelled in general. At the time, Callinan followed advice to pipe down and let the conversation happen around him, but he\u2019s now using Return to Center \u2013 an album of cover versions \u2013 to belatedly explain himself. \u201cIt was also a very good way for me to look at myself and look at my behaviour and think, \u2018Is this who I want to be?\u2019\u201d he says. The album opens with Life Is Life \u2013 the Laibach version, not the Opus original. This is significant because Laibach, a Slovenian avant-garde group formed in 1980, perform absurd pomp-rock straight-faced and employ deeply controversial imagery. Often, their intentions are confusing. Similarly, Callinan is of the opinion that \u201cart should be amoral and a conversation starter, if nothing else\u201d. When asked if he has a leave-it-to-the-gods attitude with some of his performance-art stunts, he replies, \u201cYeah, exactly that. And it\u2019s both liberating and anxiety-inducing. You suffer the consequences.\u201d He addresses those consequences head-on with some of his song choices. A cover of Rise, by Public Image Limited (originally written about apartheid in South Africa), is introduced by actors reading out news reports such as: \u201cAn error of judgement, a Sydney court\u2019s been told. That\u2019s what prompted a Sydney musician to flash himself on the Arias red carpet.\u201d Then come the lyrics of the first verse: \u201cI could be wrong, I could be right\u201d and \u2013 oh dear \u2013 \u201cI could be black, I could be white \u2026\u201d Then there\u2019s The Homosexual, by Momus, which seems to address criticism that Callinan\u2019s flirtation with cross-dressing and queer imagery is purely to titillate. His aesthetic has pinballed from homoerotic cowboy, to a John Waters pencil-moustache and floral tops, to high-waisted pants and 80s pastels \u2013 although most recently he\u2019s been toying with a chainmail coif. To this, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been dressing very flamboyantly since I was a teenager and was called a faggot growing up, got beaten up. The idea of being non-binary or fluid wasn\u2019t an option that existed to me, but I\u2019m sure if I was 10 years younger I probably would identify as that.\u201d Callinan grew up in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, though his vibe is more Newtown meets Snowtown. His father was a founding member of the Radiators, and Callinan\u2019s own band comprises Tex Crick and Mahne Frame, with guest artists. He now lives in Highland Park, northeast Los Angeles. The American media has been fairly immune to the controversy in Australia (although Spin did ask \u201cIs his brand of provocation the most interesting thing in underground music, or just nonsense?\u201d before settling favourably), preferring to focus on the fact that Callinan audaciously took advantage of US chain store Guitar Center\u2019s return policy to record the album entirely with free equipment. He even \u201cborrowed\u201d the company\u2019s branding for the album artwork. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m celebrating with them,\u201d he says, trying on that idea like a new coif. \u201cIt would be the ultimate \u2018return to center\u2019 if they see it that way and stock my record and I do in-store performances. Or they\u2019re going to sue me \u2026 and that wouldn\u2019t be bad either, to be honest.\u201d As well as being a pun on Guitar Center\u2019s returns policy, the album title refers to Callinan\u2019s intention to tone down the bravado \u2013 which, he says, was a reaction to wearing his heart on his sleeve so much in his earlier years. Somehow that vulnerability morphed into playing an outrageous character, he says, without that really being the intention. \u201cIt was easier, as a performer in the age of social media, to betray my own intelligence all the time for a cheap \u2018like\u2019 or two, playing into the vacuum a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came back to bite me, if I can speak candidly. I think some of the reactions that I\u2019ve had on some moral or political grounds have largely come from people being annoyed by my obnoxiousness or my willingness to do dumb things without recourse, when they expected better from me. So when, if, I fucked up, I wasn\u2019t given much grace or shown much mercy.\u201d In Australia, Callinan\u2019s rather stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just as there are those early fans, he suspects, who feel let down by the art pranks he embarked on, there are more recent fans who will feel betrayed by words of contrition. It explains why he was so drawn to one more cover on the album, Robert Wyatt\u2019s Signed Curtain, with its dispiriting acknowledgement that composing a song in order to connect can be a wasted effort. \u201cI found that so heartbreaking,\u201d says Callinan, \u201cthe idea that I would be so hellbent on getting someone\u2019s affection \u2013 or collective affection \u2013 that I would form a band and record this song and sing it with all my heart, only to admit that this is futile.\u201d But that, surely, is the essence of every songwriter, the desire to be understood. \u201cTotally,\u201d he says. \u201cBut few admit their failings and Robert Wyatt just admits that, actually, this is all bullshit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u2022 Kirin J Callinan\u2019s Return To Centre is out now through EMI.
