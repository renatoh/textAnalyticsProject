We spoke to three donors \u2013 a former child refugee, the captain of a ferry and the daughter of Jewish refugees \u2013 about what inspired them to support the appeal. Carry Gorney: \u2018I\u2019m here by chance\u2019 Carry Gorney\u2019s parents left Germany on their wedding day, their guests running down the station platform to wave them goodbye. It was 1937; the Jewish couple never saw their guests again. They spent their honeymoon travelling through the Balkans. Traumatised from leaving his home, Gorney\u2019s father was sick for the entire journey. They left to seek refuge in the UK, but her father was interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. He was carrying only a suitcase. They were not allowed to take money into the UK, but he did bring 78 classical records. \u201cHe was obsessed with music,\u201d says Gorney. Inspired by her parents\u2019 story, Gorney has spent her life telling the stories of marginalised people through the arts, including street theatre and film. She was moved by her parents\u2019 letters to tell their story in a book \u2013 and to support the refugee appeal. \u201cI\u2019m here by chance,\u201d she says. I want to give those children shivering under tents the same chance. I\u2019m desperate \u2013 I can\u2019t bear these people walking through Europe. It\u2019s just a nightmare. Bill Londesborough: \u2018You can\u2019t help but think in their situation you\u2019d be doing exactly the same\u2019 As the captain of a Channel crossing between Dunkirk and Dover, Bill Londesborough witnesses the refugee crisis on a daily basis. Refugees and migrants come to Dunkirk\u2019s port every night. They are predominantly young men, thin and \u201cobviously suffering from malnutrition\u201d, he says. In the five years prior to this summer, Londesborough had witnessed people making occasional attempts to cross the Channel, but since security was tightened in Calais he has noticed a huge increase in numbers. Last night was very quiet, he tells me, but for the last two weeks people have managed to get into the port, coming through the canal or scaling the high razor-wire fences. He remembers one young man who was killed after falling from the truck under which he had stowed himself. He recalls another who hauled himself up the taut ship rope, braving a drop of 15-20 metres near the top. He managed to clamber on board, only to be escorted off the ship and out of the port by the French authorities. The guy that spotted him climbing the rope didn\u2019t want to shout for fear he would spook him and he would fall off. When he got to the top, you would expect him to be really disappointed but it was just absolute acceptance \u2013 that attempt had failed. He will make another attempt. That is his life. Londesborough, 62, says it has changed his perception of refugees and migrants \u2013 and prompted him to support the appeal. Until you experience things, they don\u2019t necessarily touch you as much as they should. In my professional life they present us with a problem, but it\u2019s extremely sad, you can\u2019t help think that in the same situation you\u2019d be doing exactly the same. It seems so hopeless. Stefan: \u2018We didn\u2019t have more than two coins to rub together\u2019 Stefan \u2013 not his real name \u2013 was five years old when his family arrived in the US as refugees. He was born in Sweden soon after his parents arrived there having fled from Latvia during the second world war, on a boat captained by his grandfather. When we came to America we didn\u2019t have more than two coins to rub together. We lived in the attic of a Latvian church in New York,\u201d he remembers. His parents found work, his mother as a cleaner and his father in a factory, putting heads on dolls. Stefan donated to the appeal after his daughter requested it in lieu of a Christmas present. He doesn\u2019t find it hard to draw a comparison between his family\u2019s crisis then and that of refugees arriving in Europe today. My parents both worked really hard and never complained. They never thought life owed them anything. When I see these people in the newspapers landing in rubber dinghies on Lesbos and beginning this long trek to Germany \u2013 people with resilience and hopefulness \u2013 it\u2019s apt for the Christmas season. Regardless of the insanity in the world, human beings are survivors and they\u2019re trooping across Europe. All money raised goes to fund the vital work being done at sea, at home and in the refugee camps by the six charities chosen for our appeal \u2013 Red Cross, Migrant Offshore Aid Station, Doctors of the World, Refugee Council, City of Sanctuary and Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.
