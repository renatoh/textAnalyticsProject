The calculation, by Nationwide building society, comes a day before the publication of national test results for hundreds of thousands of 10- and 11-year-olds. The data shows living near a primary school which achieves 10% better exam scores than its neighbouring primaries can add up to 4.6% on to the price of a home. Buying a home near a school which has 10% better results in Sats \u2013 national tests in maths and English for 10- and 11-year-olds \u2013 than other schools, added an average 3.3% on to house prices, the lender found. In some cases, such as in Yorkshire and Humberside, it added as much as 4.6%. A 3.3% rise equated to an extra \u00a36,226 on an average house price of \u00a3187,659. In Yorkshire and Humberside, where the average home costs \u00a3141,093, a 4.6% rise can add \u00a36,421 on to the price of a house. Properties in the south-west rose the least \u2013 by 2.6% \u2013 by proximity to the top local primary. In London the price premium was 3%, which is the equivalent of an extra \u00a38,670, while in the suburbs of London, the price premium is 3.4% \u2013 an additional \u00a38,438 on the cost of a home. Nationwide conducted an analysis of the impact on house prices of living near a top primary school in November, but the lender has updated it for the current economic climate. Tomorrow's Sats results are expected to show that about a fifth of 10-and 11-year-olds failed to achieve the standard expected of them in maths and English in the tests this May. The results are also expected to show that boys are falling far behind girls in writing, and are also lagging in reading and science. Four out of 10 boys could not write a complete sentence using commas, while three-quarters of girls managed this task last year. In science, 89% of girls reached the standard expected of them, while 88% of boys did. But in maths, the situation was reversed, with 78% of girls able to add, subtract, multiply and divide in their heads compared with 79% of boys. This summer, over a quarter of schools boycotted Sats, throwing league tables, to be compiled later this year, into disarray. Members of the National Association of Head Teachers and the National Union of Teachers mounted a high-profile boycott because they said Sats are too crude a measure of pupil performance and are used to compile \"unfair\" league tables. They have called for the tests to be scrapped. The education secretary, Michael Gove, admitted there are flaws with the tests but said Sats will go ahead next year.He said last month that it was \"unfortunate parents and pupils in the schools that boycotted the tests will not benefit from the information that can be taken from test results\". \"I accept there are flaws in the current testing system so I am committed to reviewing national curriculum tests to ensure they are as rigorous as possible and in the best interests of schools, children, parents and the public.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
