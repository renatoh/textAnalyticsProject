With 24 hours to go before Conservative MPs cast their first votes in the contest, the shadow education secretary's refusal to confirm or deny drug use in the past appears to have been vindicated. Rivals moved to distance themselves from the furore yesterday, with David Davis warning that intensive questioning of Mr Cameron was beginning to look like a hunt. He predicted that the clamour would rapidly fade and told his own supporters: \"Do not go anywhere near this issue.\" He dismissed newspaper reports that Mr Cameron's close ally George Osborne had been acquainted with a prostitute and drug dealer as \"wholly bogus\". Kenneth Clarke said Mr Cameron was right not to answer questions about drug use, saying they amounted to a \"silly media witch hunt\". Ladbrokes said the odds on the 38-year-old becoming leader had shortened to 4/7 despite the row, placing him ahead of the former favourite Mr Davis. Dr Fox was placed at 10/1 and Mr Clarke at 14/1. A poll showed that Tory voters would not want Mr Cameron to quit the contest even if he had taken cocaine. Asked by the Mail on Sunday whether any of the leadership candidates should stand down if they had tried hard drugs, 61% of Conservative supporters said no. \"It was the put-up-or-shut-up day for newspapers and there's nothing at all there,\" said a buoyant Cameron aide. \"It's been a turbulent week but he has shown he can come through it. He's robust enough to withstand shocks like that and come out the other side. Now we can move on.\" Yesterday the News of the World and Sunday Mirror reported claims - in a deal apparently brokered by Max Clifford - that 12 years ago Mr Osborne, the shadow chancellor, took cocaine with a prostitute who was dating his friend. Mr Osborne denied ever taking drugs with Natalie Rowe, also known as Jennifer Shackleton, and dismissed the \"desperate\" stories as evidence of a smear campaign. In a statement, the Tatton MP, now 34, said: \"Twelve years ago a friend of mine went out with a woman called Natalie and they had a child together. I met them together occasionally in the autumn of 1993, and it soon became clear that my friend had started to use drugs. He became more and more addicted, and I saw his life fall apart.\" His friend had since overcome his problem. \"That is and always has been the sum total of my connection with this woman. \"It was a stark lesson to me at a young age of the destruction which drugs bring to so many people's lives.\" He had since backed tough policies against drugs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
