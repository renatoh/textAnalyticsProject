The rest of us, meanwhile, will lean forward in vicarious anticipation of either a thrilling football match or the compelling sight of yet more bad blood between two teams who appear unable to curb their loathing of each other. It is a strange and troubling expectation. Despite a romantic yearning for a free-flowing game between such extravagantly gifted sides, there is a more secret and guilty urge to see something else as well. You can dress it up and call it sporting conflict, or the drama of confrontation, but those words are just a fancy way of talking about the violence that now frames seemingly every encounter between these otherwise esteemed clubs - and generates more fevered column inches and dark chortling in the pub than any other story in British sport. The gladiatorial spectacle will be apparent from the moment they line up in an echoing tunnel - like those which this season have served as a dingy battleground both before and after their matches at Old Trafford and Highbury. Led by Sir Alex Ferguson and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the teams can be paired off as enemies from past skirmishes and present vendettas. The eyeballing and sniping are so familiar that it is enough just to list their names in tandem as if they provide the tasty undercard to the main event: Keane v Vieira, Neville v Reyes, Ronaldo v Cole, Giggs v Lauren and Van Nistelrooy v Anyone. A more tangled sporting psychology exists alongside those basic spiky differences in personality. It is as if, in such a tightly balanced encounter, some of Arsenal's and United's best players believe they need to feed their aggression to find that mysterious extra edge. They often make the mistake of allowing this obsession to ruin their concentration - but the inner struggle adds depth to the raw controversy. Connoisseurs of the feud believe that this very competition provided the earliest stage for the 17 years of discord. In February 1988 Arsenal's Nigel Winterburn taunted United's Brian McClair for missing a late penalty in a FA Cup fifth-round tie. And then, in October 1990, Arsenal's Anders Limpar fouled Denis Irwin. McClair and Winterburn led the ensuing carnage as 21 players traded punches. Arsenal were docked two league points, United one, and the FA fined both clubs \u00a350,000. Further skirmishes entertained us before the return of open warfare in September 2003. Vieira was dismissed at Old Trafford for aiming a kick at the theatrically stricken Van Nistelrooy. When the Dutchman squandered a last-minute penalty he was jostled by jeering Gunners. Last October, Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten run ended in Manchester - with Ferguson apparently being assailed in the tunnel by flying pizza and a cup of soup. This February's clash merely featured Keane facing down Vieira before the match - after he accused the Arsenal captain of intimidating Gary Neville. In contrast to the traditional letdown of a wan FA Cup final - epitomised by the last two years in which United and Arsenal dispatched Millwall and Southampton with politely tedious ease - today's battle is full of enough bile to remind us of even more intense sporting enmities. United v Arsenal still pales when set against the ancient and enduring ferocity of an Old Firm clash. Tommy Burns, having played for and managed Celtic against Rangers, suggests that such edgy and vehement matches leave participants and spectators alike \"exhilarated and nauseated all in one\" - which echoes the ambivalent feelings towards this final. The sectarian loathing that splits Glasgow in half is obviously missing from the acrimony that now binds Arsenal and United. It is just as sobering, as a way of maintaining some sort of perspective on this English football spat, to consider the far more dangerous personal battles between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost as well as Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Even more than football fans who thrive on communal antagonism against opposition supporters, such lonely duels are extreme examples of the way in which many great sportsmen often use a private hostility towards a rival to uncover their deepest inspiration. \"Metaphorically,\" Prost once said, \"Senna wanted to destroy me...\" In more visceral terms, at Suzuka in 1989, with Senna needing to finish ahead of Prost to win the drivers' championship, they drove each other off the track in their simultaneous refusal to give way on a tight chicane. The threat of death, especially to Senna, seemed less distressing than losing the title. Ali was more childlike in taunting Frazier before The Thrilla In Manilla - their third and cataclysmic fight in 1975. \"Joe Frazier should give his face to the Wildlife Fund,\" Ali yelped. \"He's so ugly, blind men go the other way. We can't have a gorilla for a champ.\" A seething Frazier insisted: \"We got nowhere to go after this. I'm gonna eat this half-breed's heart out of his chest. I mean it. This is the end of him or me.\" And so it almost proved. Ali won a savage fight but he took such a beating that he said: \"We went to Manila as champions, Joe and me, and we came back as old men.\" The FA Cup final is a less primal affair. Even Keane and Vieira are not expected to produce such naked fury. Yet Ferguson and Wenger have often been guilty of producing the same schoolyard mockery that Ali used to humiliate Frazier - with the United manager describing Arsenal as the \"worst losers of all time\" and Wenger insisting Ferguson has \"lost all sense of reality\" and \"Van Nistelrooy can only cheat.\" There is also a sporting significance to today's result. In the wake of Malcolm Glazer's invasion, the consequences of defeat would seem particularly wounding to United. Having finished a distant third in the Premiership for the second successive year, the red juggernaut which won eight Premiership titles in 11 seasons, and four FA Cups, is at risk of being derailed. Arsenal have their own demons. For all their exquisite football a familiar inability to win back-to-back championships, and their continuing inferiority complex in Europe, again undermines their claim to be a great team. Another failure, after four straight defeats to United, would demand an even more stringent examination of their psychological flaws. Vieira argues that \"this is the best Cup final people could have hoped for. I really believe that these are the best two footballing teams in the country\". That view will be disputed by Jose Mourinho and an exultant Chelsea - who will watch this latest showdown between the country's angriest teams with relaxed amusement. But Vieira is at least right in insisting that today will be unmissable - unlike last month's woeful semi-finals when United outplayed Newcastle and Arsenal rose above the limited challenge of Blackburn Rovers before thousands of empty seats in Cardiff. This time it is the real deal in a seething stadium, a riveting test for two former champions beset by rage and uncertainty. Fireworks and fisticuffs, and a few sublime goals, are the very least we expect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
