I wrote 16 cheques for \u00a350 each but four of them bounced because of insufficient funds in my bank account. I wanted to extend one of the cheques for another month and I used my Barclaycard to pay The Money Shop's \u00a38.99 charge. But then The Money Shop took another \u00a350 from my Barclaycard to cover one of the cheques that had bounced. The contract says money can be recovered from my debit card or my bank account but that any other repayment mode must have my consent. I had not given consent to use my Barclaycard. When I complained, Barclaycard credited my account and sent me a new card with a new number. But it then reinstated the charge, saying I had signed a contract allowing The Money Shop to take the money. SR, London Pay-day loans are to be avoided. I assume you needed the money desperately to agree to a 212% interest rate. The Money Shop persuaded Barclaycard it was entitled to take money from your credit card, beyond the \u00a38.99 you had agreed to, which is why Barclaycard put the charge back on your account. Now Barclaycard has looked at your account again and it has come to the conclusion that, probably, your version of events is correct and that certainly the moral argument is in your favour. It believes you are entitled to the \u00a350 and has refunded your account. I also spoke to The Money Shop. It assured me it would never take money from a credit card without the customer's consent and said that, if only you had spoken to the company directly, it could have sorted this out quickly and refunded the charge. I pointed out that you had tried to do exactly that, last October and again in January, but it couldn't find any record of your calls. That might be because it logs calls when customers phone the customer care line but not if they try to sort out their problems with anyone else. The Money Shop then explained its staff can see only the last few digits of card numbers so cannot tell if they are credit or debit cards. It says it had intended taking the money from your debit card but used the credit card in error. If it had used the debit card, you would have no grounds for complaint but, because of the mistake, The Money Shop has refunded the \u00a350 and deleted your credit card details. Barclaycard says you can keep the \u00a350 it gave you. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
