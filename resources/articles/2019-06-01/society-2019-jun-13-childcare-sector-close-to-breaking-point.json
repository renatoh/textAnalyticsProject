MPs will see a sector close to breaking point. The number of childcare providers fell by almost 10,000 in the last two years. Around half of all \u201cfree\u201d childcare places come with voluntary charges, while many providers have been forced to choose between higher parent fees or closing their doors \u2013 a situation that hits disabled children and poorer families hardest. This wasn\u2019t the intention of government policy but it is the direct result. The case has been made in every constituency and at every level: it is now up to the government to respond and ensure that funding matches the true cost of delivering quality childcare.
