Smears by unnamed Downing Street sources against Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, and Public Health England (PHE) executives show that \u201csome within government are still putting self-preservation first\u201d, according to the head of the senior civil servants\u2019 union. It comes amid concern across Whitehall that cabinet ministers and their special advisers are mounting a concerted effort to pass the blame for the UK\u2019s faltering response to the pandemic on to officials. Government sources were quoted this weekend claiming that Sedwill had failed to get a grip of government, PHE officials had not placed enough emphasis on testing and NHS England officials had failed to control personal protective equipment (PPE) supply. In an article for the Guardian, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents the UK\u2019s most senior public servants, said some in government were ignoring the dedication of public servants and instead using them as scapegoats. \u201cAs pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of PPE and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government,\u201d said Penman. \u201cWell-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England. \u201cIf mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable \u2026 While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day. \u201cRight now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day \u2013 literally putting their lives on the line for the country \u2013 some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it\u2019s also destructive.\u201d A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. \u201cHe\u2019s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,\u201d the source was quoted as saying. The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. \u201cWhat this has exposed is these people\u2019s utter lack of accountability,\u201d a senior official told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s not just PHE, it\u2019s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.\u201d In a following article, a \u201csenior figure\u201d told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply. Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments. The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office\u2019s most senior official. Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister\u2019s independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days. He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan. Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of \u201cswearing and belittling people\u201d. As well as witnessing Patel\u2019s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job and of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore. Patel has denied the claims. One Whitehall source said: \u201cIf Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.\u201d \u2022 The main image on this article was replaced on 7 April 2020 as there was a risk of identifying people unrelated to the content of the article."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
