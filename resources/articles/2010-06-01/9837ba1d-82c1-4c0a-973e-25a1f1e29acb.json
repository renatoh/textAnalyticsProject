His squad is the oldest England have ever assembled for the World Cup finals and several of the players are therefore being granted their last chance in the tournament. As with so much that the Italian does, the initial surprise is soon followed by appreciation of an underlying logic. In general the tier of younger contenders is of limited merit and the emphasis is being put on that combination of knowhow and appetite. The policy is not all that unconventional. His own country still look to Fabio Cannavaro, who turns 37 in September, regardless of the fact that he is in need of a new club now that Juventus have decided not to give him another contract. Capello's stance rests on bleak conclusions. He continues to be inscrutable and only now is it recognised that consecutive starts for Theo Walcott against Mexico and Japan were a demand that the 21-year-old prove himself anew. Capello will have recalled the hat-trick in Zagreb, which are the player's only goals for England, even as he was weighing up the unsatisfactory campaign with Arsenal for an injury-bedevilled Walcott. Underachievement is more recent and it made the deeper impression. There is no wider perspective for this manager, who is more problem-solver than visionary. For Capello the future is restricted to the days immediately before him and that was underlined when he declined to state categorically that he was committed to seeing out a contract that runs until 2012. There is comfort in the pragmatism since the England manager is obsessed with the task in hand and never tries to set out some expansive vision. Nobody lamented any focus on the short-term so long as it included two poundings of Croatia. The principal question to be asked is whether the approach he took in drawing up the World Cup squad will be vindicated. He is entitled to point out that it is experience rather than youthful verve that has been the secret to taking the trophy for other countries, including the holders Italy. All the same, speed has its worth. If England held a 1-0 lead and wanted to keep the opposition off-balance with counter-attacks, pace would be important to that plan. With Walcott discarded, there is less acceleration at Capello's disposal, although Aaron Lennon can supply it. While the manager has amassed many hardened professionals, particularly after talking Jamie Carragher into a comeback, they are affected by wear and tear. In view of Capello's track record no one is in any hurry to doubt him but it would have been educational to hear the discussions that led to the construction of this party. The manager must have concluded that starts against Mexico and Japan sufficed to show that Rio Ferdinand was ready, irrespective of his absences at Manchester United. Although there was scant chance of him being discarded, the other centre-backs include Ledley King, with his bad knee, and John Terry, who has been through an attritional career although he has not yet got to his 30th birthday. Capello can observe that he picks the best men available. There is no scope for insisting that candidates be in their prime and, of course, he made overtures to the 35-year-old Paul Scholes that were predictablyrejected. Capello would presumably have liked a dash of youth and Manchester City's Adam Johnson seemed in the ascendant until Joe Cole had such an impact against Japan. The manager was not appointed to cure the ills of the Premier League. Instead he copes shrewdly with a domestic environment in which English players constitute a minority. Someone of a less stern personality would have played to the gallery but Capello was not lured into naming the 23-year-old Tom Huddlestone. This manager will have stuck to the conclusion that the Tottenham midfielder, for all his accomplishment, is a bit cumbersome in his movement. His verdicts can at least be intriguing. Shaun Wright-Phillips has edged out Walcott despite being a substitute in seven of his dozen outings under Capello. The recollections are not of the Manchester City winger racing past opponents and he actually took the eye as one of those right-footed players the manager puts towards the left. Denied the opportunity to go wide and dribble, he looked neat as he came inside to trade passes with team-mates and improve the pattern. We have to conclude that such reliability counts with Capello. Those who have been to the fore, as Emile Heskey was as a foil to Wayne Rooney in the qualifiers, enjoy his continuing trust irrespective of the woes of the club campaign. Capello also appreciates how modest his means truly are and, when looking for back-up to Ashley Cole, ditched Leighton Baines and turned to Stephen Warnock, whose England career comprises six minutes against Trinidad &amp; Tobago in May 2008. In the build-up to the tournament Capello has to rejuvenate men still feeling the fatigue of the Premier League campaign and trust that no injuries will afflict the small core of key footballers on whom England's hopes depend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
