While their comeback at Everton was gripping, here it was much less inexorable and decidedly cruel on Wigan. The home side had fought back brilliantly from two goals down to come within four added minutes of holding a top four team for the first time and giving Sir Alex Ferguson the most unexpected of 65th birthday presents, only to be undone by Arjen Robben with two minutes remaining. It was not exactly undeserved - Robben had been excellent all afternoon - but Wigan gave Chelsea one of their toughest games of the season and from the look on Jose Mourinho's face two minutes before the last goal went in he knew it. 'That's heartbreaking,' Paul Jewell said. 'Chelsea won't get a tougher 45 minutes all season, but they've come back and that's why they are champions.' Mourinho begged to differ. 'Champions should not need to score in the last minute,' the Chelsea manager said. 'The fans might call that exciting but I don't. If you are in an easy game you have to kill it. We were 2-0 up after 30 minutes, in complete control, then we started playing very badly. Wigan did very well, they are an emotional team, but we let them back into the game when they should have been finished.' With a decent home crowd for a change Wigan began as if determined to show their criminal lack of ambition against Sheffield United last week was an aberration, though that does not mean they had Chelsea worried. Emile Heskey was a blunt spearhead, Svetoslav Todorov and Andreas Johansson were distinctly rusty replacements for Henri Camara and Lee McCulloch, and it was left to Chelsea to demonstrate how to attack with menace. Chris Kirkland was called into action as early as the sixth minute, saving from Salomon Kalou when the Ivorian failed to get a decisive enough touch to Ashley Cole's pass. Kalou did better from Robben's cross five minutes later, but so did the goalkeeper, touching the shot onto a post before scrambling to gather. The crowd knew it couldn't last and it didn't. Frank Lampard scored one of the easier goals of his career in the 13th minute after the Wigan defence allowed him to gather Robben's clever pass in the belief he was offside. Replays confirmed the linesman had got it exactly right and that Kevin Kilbane had not moved up smartly enough to catch Lampard out. Midway through the first half the contest looked over when the impressive Kalou scored Chelsea's second. Already giving Leighton Baines a torrid time on Chelsea's right wing Kalou put Didier Drogba in the shade in the 23rd minute when he met Robben's corner with an unstoppable header. No one told Wigan the contest was over, however, and Jewell can at least be proud of the fight his players showed to get back in the game before the interval. Heskey and Fitz Hall fired too high, then Kilbane shot straight at Henrique Hilario as Wigan showed they were not about to lie down, gaining their reward on the stroke of half time when Heskey got his head to a Josip Skoko free-kick after Heskey himself had been fouled by Khalid Boulahrouz. Chelsea would not have found Jose Mourinho at his happiest at the break and came out determined to re-emphasise their superiority, only for Lampard to miss an excellent chance after doing most of the hard work by clearing a path to goal. The bonus for spectators was that what had looked like a mismatch in the first half, a mere matter of how many goals Chelsea would win by, was now a rousing scrap with battles all over the pitch and chances being created at each end. Kilbane and Johansson went close for the home side as Wigan rediscovered their pride and stopped being so impressed by their opponents, Kalou had a goal ruled offside after another good run by Robben. It was not always pretty but it was exactly what was needed on a freezing December evening, and though referee Mike Dean generally did well to let the game flow, he appeared to be harsh in booking Heskey when the forward won a 50-50 challenge with Ricardo Carvalho in the Chelsea penalty area. No matter, Heskey had a second goal to celebrate moments later. Substitute David Cotterill made the initial inroads, charging down the right and sending over a cross that Denny Landzaat returned for Heskey to turn over the line. He, too, looked offside, having only just stepped back on the pitch after crossing the goal line, though even then, in true pantomime fashion, Boulahrouz was behind him. Heskey was helping out in defence moments later, but Wigan could not hang on for a draw. They could not get enough bodies close enough to prevent Robben drilling in a low shot from the edge of the area, and Kirkland was beaten partly thanks to a dummy from Didier Drogba. The only, small, consolation for the home side is that crowds should not be a problem while entertainment like this is on offer. A cruel late goal by Hernan Crespo settled this fixture last season but set the tone for Wigan's campaign. Strangely enough, this latest setback could be just the boost they need. Man of the match: Arjen Robben At various stages in the game it could have been Salomon Kalou or Emile Heskey, but Robben was a constant danger to Wigan, and capped an impressive game with the decisive goal at the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
