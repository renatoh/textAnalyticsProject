Theatre greats celebrate Michael Billington", "bodyText": "Tom Stoppard: In the theatre, Michael is simply \u201cBillington\u201d, like a brand. Four stars from Billington is a relief and a blessing; a single star is as rare as five. Actually rarer. After so many reviews and so many years, I doubt Michael ever enters a theatre pessimistically. How could he keep going for so long if he didn\u2019t expect to be blown away every time? When he can\u2019t like something as much as he\u2019d like to like it, he often writes \u201cMuch as I admire\u2026\u201d before he dissents. A curate\u2019s egg never got a fairer deal. Not very long after Michael took over, Kenneth Tynan asked me, \u201cWho is the critic now?\u201d then answered his own question tentatively: \u201cMichael Billington?\u201d I didn\u2019t have a better answer. Laura Wade: Playwrights aren\u2019t supposed to care about reviews. I do care \u2013 I can\u2019t help being interested \u2013 and the one I care about most is Michael\u2019s. He brings a sense of history, vast knowledge and unmatched experience. Is there anyone writing now who has seen more plays? It matters to Michael that our work is both theatrically and politically rigorous, and mentally and visually stimulating. He holds us to account. And when he really gets what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 as he did with my most recent play, The Watsons \u2013 it\u2019s the best feeling. It galvanises you. His love for the theatre and his belief that plays can be a catalyst for change and a force for good make him a humane and timely reminder of the value of experts. Harriet Walter: My first mention in a Billington review was in 1970 when I was a pre-drama school usher at Ed Berman\u2019s Ambiance Lunch Hour theatre. We were roped in to chat to the audience and invite them for a spin on the dancefloor. We had our names on our lapels and I unwittingly selected Michael B as my partner. His review said something like: \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day one enters a theatre to be swept on to a dancefloor by an usherette called Harriet.\u201d Little did either of us know that he would be reviewing my acting for the next 50 years. Michael would venture where other critics feared to tread. In my early years on the political fringe, he would turn up at some shabby little venue miles out of London on a rainy Tuesday and honour us with a review. That dedication and breadth of perspective have stayed with him. Peter Brook: A good critic has an eye like a scanner, an ear like a composer, the tongue that enjoys sweet and sour, a razor-like intelligence and a deeply tender heart. Michael has all of these, and I will miss reading all he writes. Atiha Sen Gupta: I first crossed paths with Michael in 2009 when my debut play, What Fatima Did, about a young woman who adopts the hijab on the eve of her 18th birthday, was produced at Hampstead theatre. The much-feared and much-feted \u201cBillington review\u201d came out, and the cast and crew breathed a proverbial sigh of relief: Michael\u2019s thoughts on the piece were generally positive. I was glad he had seen something in the play as it was full of loud, angry, brown kids and quite a lot of swearing \u2013 a far cry from what usually graced the main stage at Hampstead. Although sharp, Michael has a generosity that seeks out the best in people\u2019s work. His review of my play ended with the words, \u201cThis is the work of a writer with a future\u201d \u2013 which I then proceeded to reproduce on everything (I\u2019ll admit, it was a bit much on birthday cards). After 48 years and 10,000 reviews, Michael can retire in the knowledge that he is a critic with a past \u2013 and an illustrious one at that. Sonia Friedman: Michael has been a powerful, trustworthy voice throughout my entire career. He can condense a show into 400 words, carrying its argument and catching its tone, in a way that few critics can. Some British reviews these days feel fluffy or a bit flip. His never do, even after all this time. They\u2019re robust, informative, even-handed. They spread credit around casts and creative teams. They always summon (and justify) an opinion \u2013 and that\u2019s easier said than done night after night, show after show. Most of all, Michael makes a case for theatre as something that matters, be it Ken Dodd or King Lear. There\u2019s a gruelling quality to criticism, turning up every night to whatever happens to be opening \u2013 panto to political theatre \u2013 and turning out copy day after day, to deadline. Doing so for half a century requires extraordinary discipline, honesty, faith in artists and in art and, really, a generosity of spirit. Michael marries intellectual self-assurance with emotional humility. I suspect he will be the last of his kind in the changing face of the media and our industry will be the poorer for his departure but I hope future critics will be inspired by his dedication and enthusiasm. Patrick Stewart: When I was 15 and worked for the Dewsbury and District Reporter, the subeditor, Charlie Pickles, told me that if I wanted to understand what good, independent journalism was, I should read the Guardian. Charlie was right then and he still is. At 15, I was bitten by the acting bug and was given, after a year in the reporters\u2019 room, an ultimatum by the editor, Henry Wilson. One night, there was a mill fire in my home town, Mirfield. Charlie had told the editor: \u201cNo need to send anyone, Patrick is next door at a council meeting.\u201d I wasn\u2019t. I was at a rehearsal with the Mirfield drama club and had planned to phone in for the council meeting report, but had been outed. Next morning, I was summoned to the editor\u2019s office and told: give up this stupid acting and do your job or get off my paper. I closed up my ancient typewriter, while my closest friend, Barry Parkin, urged me: \u201cYou are a secondary modern schoolboy, Patrick, you\u2019ll never get a job again as good as this.\u201d It has turned out he might have been wrong. From that day, the Guardian became the only newspaper for me \u2013 and when Michael took the post of theatre critic in 1971, it became clear to me that, as long as he was writing, this would be my paper. His skills were so quickly evident: a great knowledge of drama, an understanding of the roles of director and, especially, actor and, most significant for me, a complete understanding of what the Royal Shakespeare Company stood for. I can\u2019t remember when he first gave me a mention but it might have been when I played Launce in Robin Phillips\u2019s production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona alongside the tremendous Ian Richardson and the then little-known Helen Mirren. Most importantly his love of the theatre was evident in every review. He will be missed. Joe Penhall: I began reading Michael\u2019s reviews just before I became a playwright. He gave the impression playwriting was an honourable, thrilling, important occupation. It was a discourse that could banish the boredom of ordinary life. It seemed like a conversation I wanted involvement in. When he reviewed my debut play at the Royal Court Upstairs it was terse and to the point, not quite a rave. \u201cThe Court has discovered a good writer.\u201d I liked the abstemiousness of it. Other plays of mine that were slated by almost everyone else, he unexcitingly praised for their \u201cgenerosity\u201d or \u201ccompassion\u201d, assessments I probably benefited from but didn\u2019t savour. He understood my work better than most and only once did I tear my hair out \u2013 when he damned a play with faint praise while fretting: \u201cI just worry that it will give succour to rightwing opponents of nationalised healthcare.\u201d A typically utilitarian cavil which seemed a tad overripe at the time but with which I vaguely agree now. Like fine wine, his reviews took time to mature. He isn\u2019t afraid to like a play that nobody else likes and vice versa. If a play was going down badly, one would always wait for Billington\u2019s review before one slashed one\u2019s wrists. If a play opened with a brace of raves, he would occasionally bring one down to earth. Nevertheless, no matter what happened on opening night, one usually respected Michael in the morning. I made it my business to never meet him, although we were introduced once. I\u2019d got it into my head that a playwright should never meet critics and I slightly regret that now. Because I admired his respectfulness, his incisive intellect, his thoughtfulness, his extraordinary work ethic and, indeed, his considerable generosity and compassion. I loved the fact he would travel to the four corners of the earth to review theatre with the same relish and insight that he brought to homegrown work. He was influential in a way that few critics will be in the future \u2013 sometimes annoyingly so. He liked a certain kind of play (who doesn\u2019t?) but in later years he embraced eclecticism and breathed new life into his writing. Like the Rolling Stones he never stopped working. Now that time has come, he will be greatly missed \u2013 but at least I\u2019m allowed to meet him now. I\u2019m giving him four stars. The Guardian discovered a good writer\u2026 Alan Ayckbourn: I\u2019ve been writing professionally for 60 years and, for a considerable period of that time, Michael has been there encouraging, noting the development as my work gradually matured in style and shifted in focus. Throughout he wrote with an amazing sensitivity, empathy and understanding for which I shall always be grateful. His fair, balanced, intelligent reviews were driven by the love and enthusiasm he had for his job. In short, a critic with a genuine passion for theatre \u2013 which, speaking from a lifetime of experience, is far rarer than it sounds. Thank you, Michael, you are special. We shall miss you. Michael Billington will be talking to Arifa Akbar in a Guardian Live event at Kings Place, London, on 3 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
