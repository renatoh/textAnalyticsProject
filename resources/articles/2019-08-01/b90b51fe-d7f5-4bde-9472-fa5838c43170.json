Even after 30 hours of labour, I was full of energy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so elated, I couldn\u2019t switch off and sleep.\u201d That lack of sleep lasted six nights straight. In the middle of the night, she would write poems. \u201cIt was so out of character,\u201d she says. When back home, Hayes, now 49, believed she saw herself on TV. It was a news story about a woman who had won the lottery and hadn\u2019t known. It showed Sarah and her family. She excitedly called up to her mum, who was visiting. \u201cI said, \u2018Take a deep breath, you\u2019re in for a shock\u2019.\u201d Hayes says her mum looked at her, then the TV, then went upstairs to get Hayes\u2019s husband. \u201cIt was then,\u201d Hayes says, \u201cI knew something was really wrong.\u201d Further delusions followed. She was admitted into the general psychiatric ward, and her baby was removed from her. It was one of the scariest weeks of her life. \u201cI thought the staff were trying to kill me. The first night, I thought I\u2019d died.\u201d Hayes was suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder called postpartum psychosis. It affects one in 600 mothers and is slightly more common with the first born. Fifty per cent of mothers experiencing it will have no history of mental ill-health. Experts are divided about what causes it. Patients experience manic episodes that cause hallucinations and delusions extremely detached from reality. Delusions of divine superpowers are common. Once reality sets back in, a deep depression often follows. Today, a ripple of understanding has emerged following a storyline on British soap opera EastEnders that features Stacey Branning and, recently, singer Adele revealing her best friend had it. But very little is known about the grown-up children of postpartum psychosis mothers and those women who, through their disorder, were either physically or emotionally absent during what experts say is the most crucial bonding time in the child\u2019s life. This, combined with the taboo of the disorder, has often left women now aged over 50 to deal alone with lifelong feelings of guilt and shame. Some will go on to develop bipolar disorder. Terri Smith, the chief executive of Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (Panda), says: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing there\u2019s still little known about postpartum psychosis. It\u2019s such a dangerous illness and, if untreated, the risks are great.\u201d Smith\u2019s charity runs a helpline often called by \u201cdistressed dads, not knowing what\u2019s going on or how to cope\u201d. Treatment includes antipsychotic medication, therapy, and, in rare cases, electroconvulsive therapy. Even less was known 24 years ago when Hayes was alone, trembling and paranoid, without her newborn. \u201cI just needed somebody to say you\u2019ve got a postnatal illness, you will recover. But the nurses didn\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019d never heard of it.\u201d Hayes and her husband, both registered nurses, had not heard of it either, adding to the shock. Hayes\u2019s mother cared for Alex while she recovered, which led to a strong bond forming between them. For Hayes, this brings conflicting emotions: \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for her support. But I found it difficult. Because I wasn\u2019t around in those early days, I think mum sees Alex as her child sometimes.\u201d Some of this comes down to classic attachment theory. Jenny Hallam, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, says: \u201cResearch suggests adults who had secure attachments as children go on to have healthier relationships and better self worth. This piles pressure on women to maintain a close relationship with their child.\u201d Experts stress the importance of mother and baby units in hospitals, so they aren\u2019t separated during treatment. Australia is considered a world leader in this area, says Smith, but, even there, treatment can be a postcode lottery. Victoria has six units but New South Wales has none. Anne Buist, professor of perinatal psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, has run one of those six mother and baby units for 30 years. \u201cIf separated, the baby will attach to the primary caregiver,\u201d she says. \u201cThat can be difficult for mum from a psychological point of view, if the baby is preferring grandma. The sooner we can get mum well for that essential year of mother/baby bonding, the better.\u201d Buist points out that disorganised attachment can occur and lead to behavioural problems later if the mother\u2019s health isn\u2019t prioritised along with the child\u2019s. \u201cWe need to start asking how the mum is doing. Not just the child,\u201d she adds. For Nyna Giles\u2019s mother, that question came too late. Before Giles was born, Carolyn Scott was a model, socialising in high society \u2013 she was Grace Kelly\u2019s bridesmaid. But after giving birth to Nyna, things were never the same. Scott became detached from reality. She removed Giles from school and isolated herself, ashamed of the symptoms of her illness, which she hid to the friends who occasionally called in. Later in life, she deteriorated so far, she became homeless. Giles admits she used to feel \u201cashamed\u201d of her mother but that embarrassment has given way to pride: \u201cI feel compassion now. I firmly believe that year after I was born, if she\u2019d been treated then, she could\u2019ve recovered. Really my birth was the fork in the road \u2013 a path she went down and never recovered from.\u201d That path also became the end of the road for Iain Cunningham\u2019s mother, Irene. Now 43, up until very recently all Iain knew about his mother was that she died when he was three, and had been in a coma. Making the recent film Irene\u2019s Ghost to piece together a jigsaw created by stigma and silence, Cunningham discovered his mother had died in a psychiatric hospital where she had been sedated the night before for being \u201cnoisy and manic\u201d \u2013 a sea-change from the quiet Irene all her friends knew. The cardiac arrest she died from \u2013 aged 28, with no family history of heart disease \u2013 was probably related to the high doses of antipsychotics she was on, and the extreme anxiety she was experiencing. Through the film, Cunningham learns that his father\u2019s vicarious trauma and distress over the shocking change in Irene was the reason her postpartum psychosis was never even verbalised until recently: \u201cA series of euphemisms were used which avoid the bare facts of mental ill-health. A coma, trouble with her nerves, even depression or baby blues are sometimes used to play down the severity of something which is in fact an extreme psychiatric and medical emergency,\u201d he says. The film\u2019s title comes from Irene\u2019s own words upon giving birth to Cunningham: \u201cI\u2019m not Irene you know. I\u2019m her ghost.\u201d She developed symptoms of talking incessantly, not sleeping, hallucinating about rats and spiders, and believing her newborn son was God, that his head was expanding and that he was growing teeth. She would write nonsensical notes on paper and the walls. This was followed by periods of catatonia, mania, anxiety and deep depression. Cunningham now does some work with the UK charity Action on Postpartum Psychosis. He describes how far the stigma spreads: \u201cEven people working or volunteering for that charity often haven\u2019t spoken to their children about the psychosis they had when they were born. They want to, but don\u2019t know how to start it.\u201d Its CEO, Dr Jesica Heron, says: \u201cThe secrecy and shame that has surrounded postpartum psychosis for many years, can damage families and relationships \u2013 and that open discussion at the right time, in the right way, can help to build relationships and understanding.\u201d There\u2019s a silver lining in this story. In the film, Cunningham\u2019s childhood neighbours, who stepped in to help, say he was \u201cruined\u201d \u2013 a midlands colloquialism meaning spoilt. Like Hayes\u2019 son Alex, his mother\u2019s illness ultimately meant he was surrounded with more protective love, not less. Dr Heron says there are some studies suggesting that the children of mothers with postpartum psychosis might even perform better than others on measures of things such as expressive language. The tragedy of the disorder can make families incredibly close knit. The first time Californian woman Angela Burling, 63, went through it with her daughter Allyson in 1979, everyone was stumped. The former nurse went from soft-spoken and even-keeled to singing at the top of her lungs, turning on every tap in in the house, and having delusions that she was the bride of Christ, her husband was Christ himself and her daughter was the messenger of truth. Ten days straight of zero sleep led to the psychosis. She tried to jump off a bridge to \u201csave\u201d her husband Geoff in the belief he\u2019d follow her and be baptised. Medical professionals thought it was a bout of schizophrenia, but when she became pregnant again, a midwife falsely told her it was unlikely to recur. \u201cThat advice changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt prevented me receiving the treatment that exists to prevent a recurrence.\u201d Upon giving birth to her second son, Michael, in 1982, Burling remembers everything being \u201crosy and fine\u201d for nine months until one Monday, when the delusions suddenly returned. By Thursday, she was being charged with murder. The same delusions had returned \u2013 that Geoff was Christ and she Christ\u2019s wife. On Thursday morning, the delusions convinced her that her baby was the devil. \u201cI even saw his face contort into the devil,\u201d she says. Alone, terrified and experiencing psychosis, she begged God to tell her what to do. And then, \u201calmost mechanically,\u201d she drowned him in a bath. Detectives wanted Burling tried for murder but her husband mentioned what happened when she had Allyson and instead she was put in a psychiatric ward. \u201cThings got worse there,\u201d she says. \u201cI went catatonic and, as reality set in and I came down from my manic delusional state. I was left with unimaginable grief and repercussions that have stayed with me my whole life.\u201d It was only then that a psychiatrist, an expert in women\u2019s health sent by her defence attorney, diagnosed her with postpartum psychosis. \u201cAmid all the heartbreak, it was almost a relief,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have an explanation, a definable illness.\u201d Infanticide like this is extremely rare among postpartum psychosis patients, says Dr Magdalena Romanowicz, a child psychiatrist at Mayo Clinic. \u201cThe biggest worry is suicide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the leading cause of death of women with the disorder.\u201d Burling was released, given the treatment she had long needed and was found innocent of any crime. Four years later, after connecting with experts on the disorder to prevent a relapse, she received some news: she was pregnant again. \u201cI was thrilled\u201d she says. \u201cI had another chance to prove I\u2019m a great mum. Because I am a great mum.\u201d The moment Tommy came through the birth canal, Burling describes a veil of grief lifting: \u201cI\u2019d been grieving so deeply, couldn\u2019t feel happiness or joy in my heart. He removed that burden, completed my joy and freed my spirit. He gave me my life back,\u201d she says. Her daughter Allyson, 39, says she, Tommy, 32, and their mum are now extremely close, describing her as a \u201cfantastic mum\u201d. Burling feels like one of the lucky ones. She now uses her position on the board of Postpartum Support International to break down the taboo: \u201cI was able to get therapy and treatment to heal me. I\u2019ve been able to get my master\u2019s, swim, hike, bike, re-marry, be a mum to my kids,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many women didn\u2019t get these opportunities \u2013 the stigma often meant they didn\u2019t seek or receive treatment.\u201d Now that Allyson has a two-year old son, she has a new understanding of her mother\u2019s disorder: \u201cI always had admiration for her to have experienced that horror and the strength she has needed to get through that.\u201d She pauses to compose herself through tears, then says: \u201cShe\u2019s the most courageous woman I know.\u201d Action on Postpartum Psychosis is working on a guide about \u201cBeing a parent after postpartum psychosis\u201d, available later this year. www.app-network.org.
