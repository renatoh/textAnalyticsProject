A thoroughly unscientific straw poll of my friends concluded that most people are not looking forward to seeing family and watching crap TV. Some are utterly terrified, yet resigned to the idea of striking up awkward conversation with a brother-in-law trying to play footsie under the table. The one exception was a friend who had had a lot people die on him this year. There isn't much family left to say hello to. For the rest of us, have our parents implanted ho-ho-homing chips in our heads so we return to the nest at the customary time of giving? There's something slightly backward about flocking to one's parents for the holiday season. If there are fewer than 10 years between your current age and the last time you were legitimately a teenager, the annual parental flocking is fine. But if you're over 30 and fancy yourself an independent human being, it's time to cut the apron strings. I'm not being a Scrooge: you shouldn't negate the important things in life. But a lot of us feel obliged to spend the holiday season in the company of people we don't want to be with. Woe betideyou if you cause a fuss by turning down the offer of dodgy jumpers, dry turkey and awkward dinner table silences by moaning about your job or recent pre-Christmas breakup. Last Christmas, I spent what I think will be my last obligatory Yuletide with my partner's family, one of whom turned to me and asked \"Do your people celebrate Christmas?\" My allegations of racism were met with \"How dare you call me racist? My best friend as a child was a \u2026 [insert N-word].\" Cue choking gasps of horror round the dinner table. This year, to save me from tears, this Christmas I'm pitching in with friends \u2013 people I've spent the year in contact with and to whom I don't have to explain myself. In the consumer wonderland that is the customary time of giving, it's easy to get sucked into buying presents for people you only speak to once a year. It forges an artificial sense of closeness with which to smite away the fact that you'll be poor in January. So, just stay away. Gather your partners and friends and spend these days in the company of those you want to be with, and who want to be with you. Forge your own traditions and encourage everyone else to do the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
