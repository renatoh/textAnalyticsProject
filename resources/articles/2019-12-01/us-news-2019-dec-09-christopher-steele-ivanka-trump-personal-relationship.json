Horowitz\u2019s review of the FBI\u2019s 2016 investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign and its links with Russia includes fresh details of Steele\u2019s interactions with the FBI, and startling claims about his relationship with the Trumps dating back to the period before he wrote a controversial dossier on Trump. The report did not mention Ivanka Trump by name but her identity was revealed by ABC News. The report said that contrary to what Donald Trump has claimed on Twitter Steele was actually \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d to the Trump family. It was \u201cridiculous\u201d to suggest he was biased against the then Republican candidate or that his memos on collusion, written at the behest of the Washington-based research firm Fusion GPS, were in any way biased, Steele told federal investigators. Steele said he had visited Ivanka Trump at Trump Tower and had been \u201cfriendly\u201d with her for \u201csome years\u201d. He described their relationship as \u201cpersonal\u201d. The former British government spy had even given her a \u201cfamily tartan from Scotland\u201d as a present, the report quoted him as saying. ABC also reported that Ivanka Trump even discussed work that Steele\u2019s firm \u2013 Orbis Business Intelligence \u2013 might do for the Trump family business. Earlier this year Steele met with members of the inspector general\u2019s team in London and spoke to investigators via Skype. He handed over memos setting out his two meetings in 2016 with the FBI, in which he passed on his dossier which said that the Russians had been seeking to cultivate Trump for some years, and had secretly compromised him in a Moscow hotel room. Horowitz\u2019s conclusions were sent to Orbis ahead of the report\u2019s publication on Monday. This prompted Steele to issue an unusual statement via his lawyers pushing back against some of the inspector general\u2019s key claims. The report concludes the FBI placed too much emphasis on Steele\u2019s work. It said Steele\u2019s reporting was not done \u201cin bad faith\u201d but sometimes showed a \u201clack of judgement\u201d and could involve pursuing people with \u201cpolitical risk but no intelligence value\u201d. On Monday Steele\u2019s Washington-based law firm, Bredhoff &amp; Kaiser, issued a lengthy rebuttal of Horowitz\u2019s findings and defended Steele\u2019s professional work. It said that the Trump-Russia memos written by Steele in 2016 were derived from \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d human sources. Subsequently his reporting was \u201cextensively corroborated\u201d, the lawyers said. Some of this confirmation came from testimony given by Carter Page, Trump\u2019s former foreign policy aide. Page is at the centre of the Horowitz review. The president appointed Horowitz after Republicans claimed Page was the victim of \u201cillegal\u201d FBI spying in 2016, with a surveillance warrant issued by a federal court in part because of the dossier. The report finds that the FBI made multiple mistakes and errors in its handling of the Page case. Page admitted that in 2016 he met with senior officials from the Kremlin and the oil firm Rosneft in Moscow. This was what the dossier reported, Steele\u2019s lawyers pointed out. They added that Steele\u2019s memos \u2013 published by BuzzFeed \u2013 were never \u201cmeant to be made public\u201d. The report further quotes Steele as saying his field work was meant to be \u201cbriefed off of orally\u201d rather than consumed as a \u201cwritten product\u201d. Donald Trump has repeatedly blasted Steele on Twitter, describing him as a \u201cfailed spy\u201d and his dossier as \u201cphoney\u201d. The dossier says Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, launched a multi-faceted campaign to boost Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Robert Mueller confirmed \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d Russian interference but did not establish that Trump had engaged in a criminal-level conspiracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
