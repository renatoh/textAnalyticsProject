When citizens asked him who he was, he said, \"Quiet!\" and continued with his impromptu speech. Previously little-known even in Slavyansk, the self-appointed \"people's mayor\" said he had served in the Soviet army in a \"special operations unit\" of the Arctic-based northern fleet and now owned a soap factory. He has become the public face and apparent leader of the pro-Russian militia and protesters who remain ensconced in official buildings. Soon after he assumed office, Ponomarev called on Vladimir Putin to send in peacekeeping troops, and later asked him to supply weapons. Ponomarev's men also captured Ukrainian reporter Irma Krat and Simon Ostrovsky, a reporter for Vice News. \"We need a bargaining chip,\" he said. Both were later released. At a press conference on Thursday, Ponomarev said that 2,500 residents of the region were defending Slavyansk, although he has previously said that his forces include veterans from Russia, Moldova and Kazakhstan. Ponomarev pledged he would neither surrender nor negotiate with Kiev."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
