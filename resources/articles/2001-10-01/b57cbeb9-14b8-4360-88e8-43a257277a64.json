The 38-year-old adviser to Stephen Byers, the transport secretary, who said on September 11 that it was a good day to \"bury bad news\", summoned a Sky TV crew to her sixth floor ministerial office to make the brief statement. \"I want to again sincerely apologise for the huge offence I have caused by sending this email. I fully understand people's disgust at what I wrote. It is something that I wish I had never done and indeed find it difficult to believe that I did,\" she said. Rival TV and radio crews, as well as newspaper reporters, fumed at their exclusion. With Mr Byers and Downing Street standing by her, some Labour MPs signalled they now consider the issue closed. \"She's very good at her work. But she is abraisive and she is insensitive. When she makes a mistake it's a whopper,\" conceded one friend. Tony Blair is certain to be challenged at Commons question time today. Last night some Labour backbenchers joined Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs in believing Ms Moore should still resign, as an elected minister would have been forced to do by now. Fellow spin doctors claimed the statement - of which Downing Street was given notice, but did not vet - showed \"real guts\". One said: \"There but for the grace of God go any of us.\" Theresa May, the shadow transport secretary, said last night: \"I note that the apology was to Stephen Byers and the government and not just to the families involved in the tragedy in New York. \"It remains our view that Stephen Byers is responsible for the conduct of his special advisers and that they should both still resign.\" Tony Wright, the chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, demanded Ms Moore's resignation as soon as possible to restore the government's dignity. Another friend said last night that Ms Moore barely remembered the email. Upon being told the memo had been leaked to the press, she said:' \"It doesn't mean anything to me, I'll have to look at it.\" Jo Moore's statement: I want to again sincerely apologise for the huge offence I have caused by sending this email. I fully understand people's disgust at what I wrote. It is something that I wish I had never done and indeed find it difficult to believe that I did. It is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life. I cannot take back - no matter how I wish I could - this terrible error of judgment. But I hope people will accept that my regret is genuine and heartfelt. And equally, I hope that everyone will accept that in life we all do things we regret and that the most important thing is that we try to learn from them. I am also very sorry for the real embarrassment I have caused government, the department and Stephen Byers. I am grateful to be given another chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
