The 23\u2011year\u2011old, who also had a loan period at Celtic last season, saved a penalty in the dying moments of the 1-0 win against Hearts on Saturday. Although nothing has been said officially, Forster's long-term prospects at St James' Park seem bleak. \"If it happens, it happens,\" said Forster, of completing a transfer to Celtic. \"I'm just focused on trying to play well here, and if you play well, anything can happen. \"This is a great club, and I have loved my time here so far. The manager has been brilliant with me, so I can't really ask any more. It is a fantastic club here, and the chance to play in Europe is something that very few players get to do. So I'm just honoured to be playing for such a big club and I just work hard and see where it takes me.\" Forster's save of Eggert Jonsson's spot-kick prompted wild scenes inside Celtic Park. Victor Wanyama had earlier claimed the game's only goal, a stunning hit from 25 yards. \"I think I was due to make a penalty save at some point,\" Forster said. \"It was a fantastic victory and three points for us. I didn't think it was a penalty in the first place, so justice was done in the end. The referee thought it was a hand ball, but I was disappointed it was given.\" Celtic remain four points adrift of Rangers in the Scottish Premier League, after the leaders won 2-0 at Hibernian. The focus for Celtic now reverts to the Europa League. Only victory at Udinese on Thursday will take Neil Lennon's team into the knockout phase; Celtic have never won a competitive fixture in Italy. \"Records are there to be broken,\" Forster said. \"So we've just got to go there and play the way we know we can. I don't see why we can't go there feeling confidence in our ability in this squad. \"We are on a great run, and winning breeds confidence. It is important we keep that run going. We can be delighted with the way we have played in the Europa League, and I don't see why we can't win in Udinese, knowing the way we can play.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
