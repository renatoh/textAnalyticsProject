Tottenham are well placed in the chase for Champions League qualification but know that their position is precarious, with Liverpool, Manchester City and Aston Villa all within touching distance of the precious fourth spot. Defoe's contribution to their cause this season has been key, his 17 goals accounting for almost a third of the club's league total. The England striker has also struck six goals in other competitions, including the FA Cup, where Tottenham will have to contest Wednesday's quarter-final replay against Fulham without him. The Premier League is their priority and, although Redknapp can still call on Peter Crouch, Eidur Gudjohnsen and the resurgent Russian Roman Pavlyuchenko, he will be aware that Tottenham lost both the league matches that Defoe missed through suspension in October, including one against tomorrow's opponents, Stoke City. Defoe is also likely to miss games against Portsmouth and Sunderland. Furthermore, Redknapp knows from bitter experience that the three-week prognosis is far from infallible, meaning Tottenham may be deprived of Defoe for their gruelling second half of April, when they will play Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. \"He just hit a shot in training, then pulled up and said, 'I've done my hamstring,'\" said Redknapp. \"It's a grade two tear, so he shouldn't be out for more than three weeks according to the physio but that's what we thought about Aaron Lennon too, so you never know.\" Lennon has been out of action since 28 December with a hernia problem that was initially considered minor. Redknapp said the winger may finally resume full training next week but the manager is reluctant to forecast when he may return to the pitch. With Tom Huddlestone, Jermaine Jenas, David Bentley and Danny Rose all unfit too, Tottenham's midfield has a threadbare look. Their defence remains depleted by the chronic injuries to Jonathan Woodgate and Ledley King. \"We're going through a bad spell of injuries at the moment, at the worst possible time. I don't know why, the players warm up very, very well, so it's just one of those things. But we're short now. We're fighting on two fronts and we can't rest players because we haven't got anyone to rest.\" Despite Defoe's injury, Redknapp said he does not regret allowing Robbie Keane to join Celtic on loan. \"You can't start thinking, 'Oh, I wish I did this or that,'\" he said. \"You just have to get on with it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
