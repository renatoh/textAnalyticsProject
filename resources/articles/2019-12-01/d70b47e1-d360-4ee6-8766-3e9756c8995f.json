A report by the justice department\u2019s inspector general demolished three years of claims by the president that he was the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy and that the investigation was based on a dossier compiled by an ex-British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele. \u201cThe report issued today by the inspector general debunks the conspiracy theories about the Mueller report and the Russia investigation that President Trump and Republicans in Congress have pushed for years,\u201d Jerrold Nadler, the chair of the House judiciary committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House oversight committee, said in a joint statement. \u201cThose discredited conspiracy theories were attempts to deflect from the president\u2019s serious and ongoing misconduct, first urging Russia and now extorting Ukraine into interfering with our elections to benefit himself personally and politically.\u201d But the report by the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, did pinpoint \u201cserious performance failures\u201d in the monitoring of a Trump aide, which the president\u2019s allies seized on in an attempt to claim vindication. Horowitz identified 17 \u201csignificant inaccuracies or omissions\u201d in applications for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance or Fisa court to monitor the communications of the former Trump adviser Carter Page and subsequent warrant renewals. The errors resulted in \u201capplications that made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case\u201d, the report said, although the FBI had a legal \u201cauthorized purpose\u201d to ask for court approval. The attorney general, William Barr, rejected Horowitz\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to open the investigation. \u201cThe inspector general\u2019s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a US presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\u201d Barr said. However, the inspector general concluded there was no evidence to support the claim by Trump and his supporters that he would uncover bias in the top ranks of the FBI. The president has repeatedly suggested the Russia investigation was driven by Barack Obama\u2019s justice department because it wanted Hillary Clinton to win the White House. Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, has been demonised by Trump. McCabe\u2019s counsel, Michael Bromwich, said \u201cthe review found an ample factual basis for the launching of the Russia investigation. It also found unanimity \u2013 among FBI and DoJ personnel at every level \u2013 that the investigation needed to be opened, and that not doing so would have been a dereliction of duty by the FBI.\u201d The investigation, ultimately taken over by the special counsel Robert Mueller, started in July 2016 after the FBI learned that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump aide, had been saying before it was publicly known that Russia possessed dirt on Clinton in the form of hacked emails. It was this, not the so-called \u201cSteele dossier\u201d, that was the trigger. Horowitz found that the FBI had overstated the significance of Steele\u2019s past work as an informant and left out information about one of Steele\u2019s sources whom Steele called a \u201cboaster\u201d who \u201cmay engage in some embellishment\u201d. The report also says law enforcement officials failed to offer \u201cgreater clarity on the political origins and connections\u201d of Steele\u2019s reporting, including the fact that the political research firm that selected him had been hired by Democrats. Intriguingly, Horowitz made reference to Steele having met a member of the Trump family at Trump Tower in 2010. According to ABC News, which viewed communications between them, the family member was Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, who wanted to discuss the possibility of Steele working for the Trump Organization on overseas business. The report states: \u201cSteele called the allegation that he was biased against Trump from the start \u2018ridiculous\u2019. He stated that if anything he was \u2018favourably disposed\u2019 toward the Trump family before he began his research because he had visited a Trump family member at Trump Tower and \u2018been friendly\u2019 with [the family member] for some years. \u201cHe described their relationship as \u2018personal\u2019 and said he once gifted a family tartan from Scotland to the family member.\u201d The report says the FBI also sent an informant to record a conversation with a \u201chigh-level Trump campaign official\u201d who was not considered a subject in the Russia investigation. The official was not named. This is not the end of the saga. A separate criminal investigation continues, overseen by Barr and led by a US attorney, John Durham. Extraordinarily, Durham weighed in on Monday, issuing a statement that said \u201cwe do not agree with some of the report\u2019s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened\u201d. Matthew Miller, the chief spokesman at the justice department under Obama, responded on Twitter: \u201cWhy is he commenting on the incomplete findings of an ongoing investigation he is conducting? This is totally inappropriate and a sign of real rot setting in at DoJ. Shut up until you\u2019re finished.\u201d The inspector general report comes as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in Congress centered on his efforts to have Ukraine investigate a political rival, Joe Biden. Trump ignored the report\u2019s conclusions and reiterated a baseless claim of victimhood. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,\u201d he said at the White House. \u201cIt should never again happen to another president. It is incredible, far worse than I ever thought possible, and it\u2019s an embarrassment to our country, it\u2019s dishonest.\u201d In instant response to the president\u2019s remarks, Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director, told the MSNBC network: \u201cWe are officially living in an alternate reality. I have the IG report in my hand. I can assure you the president hasn\u2019t read it and is lying about it.\u201d Meanwhile, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, welcomed the \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d offered by the report and said he had offered more than 40 \u201ccorrective steps\u201d to address its recommendations. This includes modifying processes under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, both for initial applications and renewals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
