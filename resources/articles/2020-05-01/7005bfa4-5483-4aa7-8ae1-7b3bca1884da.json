Arranged, that is, by the two of them. They moved in together 10 years ago, despite barely knowing each other, but determined to make it work. \u201cWe made a decision within those first few weeks that was, \u2018all right, we\u2019re in love, let\u2019s just do this. This is it\u2019,\u201d says Burt. They met in Darwin in 2009. UK-born Freddy was backpacking around Australia and was at a party on Nightcliff beach one night. He was playing Beatles songs (almost certainly Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, remembers Burt) when he spotted his now-husband: \u201cI was playing the ukulele on the other side of the fire, looking at Burt, thinking, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s cute, I bet he\u2019d be a nice boyfriend\u2019.\u201d The feeling was mutual. \u201cI saw him out of the corner of my eye and I certainly enjoyed his British accent and the songs he was playing,\u201d says Burt. They wound up together at the end of the night. Like Freddy, Burt was visiting Darwin and had only been in town for a few months. Neither intended settling down. They\u2019d each recently come out to a few close friends, and were enjoying the freedoms of being in a new city and living on their own terms. Says Fred: \u201cI think I seemed like someone that was very confident and out but it wasn\u2019t true. It was really just because I was in Darwin and nobody knew me that I could finally be myself.\u201d They were inseparable after that first night. But at the end of the year, they had to return home \u2013 Freddy to Poole in the UK and Burt to Melbourne. They agreed to come out to their friends and family, and depended on each other for support along the way. \u201cWe\u2019d call each other and tell each other how it went. It all was very emotional and very important at the time,\u201d says Fred. \u201cIt was us against the world.\u201d It was particularly tough for Burt. His Malaysian family are not religious but hold traditional values and struggled to accept his sexuality. \u201cIt helped that Fred was going through the same things, understood the fear and the same sorts of feelings that I was feeling. It just so happened that Fred had a good experience with his family who were very accepting, whereas I had the opposite, and that lasted for a few years.\u201d After Christmas, they both returned to Darwin, but then had to formalise their relationship quickly, before Fred\u2019s visa ran out. Fred moved in with Burt and they opened up a bank account together. The added pressure they felt thanks to their immigration dramas and Burt\u2019s family drew them even closer. \u201cHaving all these outside people trying to break us up almost, it made us even more resilient and more like, \u2018well, we\u2019ll show you\u2019,\u201d says Fred. After spending some time together in Darwin, they travelled around Asia for a couple of years, before returning to Australia and eventually settling in Melbourne. It was a career move for both, but it helped to improve their relationship with Burt\u2019s family, who could see how committed they were. In 2016 Fred realised that, because he was British, they could get married at the UK consulate in Melbourne, before it was legal in Australia. They wanted to do so as a protest against the same-sex marriage debate that was happening at that time. \u201c[It was] to make the point that this is so ridiculous, every other western country has already implemented this, why are we going through this process?\u201d They were married in August 2016 by the British high commissioner. Even though it was a political statement, it was very personal too. \u201cI actually think it was one of the most romantic things we ever did,\u201d says Fred. \u201cStanding up in front of people, announcing our love and having this group of people watching us do it. It was all very rushed and not very scripted, we did the shortest vows that you could. [I said] \u2018I take you to be my husband,\u2019 and I burst into tears. It was really, really emotional. And then that whole day we were in this little bubble together.\u201d Burt agrees: \u201cEven though we weren\u2019t getting married necessarily for a need to confirm our relationship, because we didn\u2019t need that, the love that everyone else showed for us nevertheless did give us that high for that few months after.\u201d A wedding is as much for others as for the couple, says Fred. \u201cSaying that word, \u2018my husband\u2019, and especially in Australia [at that time] it was nice when people were like, \u2018Oh, your husband. Oh, you\u2019re married. You\u2019re gay and you\u2019re married.\u2019 People were really interested by it. It helped me own our relationship a bit more too, which I enjoyed.\u201d It also helped to cement Fred\u2019s place within Burt\u2019s family, especially with his father. \u201cOn our wedding day, he sent us a message that was [something like] \u2018Although we have traditional values, we now accept Fred in the family\u2019.\u201d It meant a lot to Fred, and that inclusion has continued. \u201cBurt has taught me more about the value of a large, extended family, and that what you put into it, you get out of it.\u201d Initially he wasn\u2019t sure about being part of such a big family. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different people that you can spend a whole week seeing different people and you still have only seen a tenth of the family.\u201d But now he sees the positives. \u201cAs you build those relationships and get to know these people, you start to enjoy it.\u201d Being close with Burt\u2019s family also helps, given his own is so far away. \u201cThat is something that I always feel guilty about, living here. But at the same time, I kind of know that I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I was in the UK probably, and my parents understand that. They love coming here too.\u201d One of the strengths of their relationship is that they enjoy spending much of their time together. \u201cWe hang out all the time. We have most of the same shared friends. We hang out with Burt\u2019s family a lot and we\u2019ll always be together. Similarly, when we go on holiday, it\u2019s always to visit my family, and we\u2019re always together the whole time. We don\u2019t really do much apart,\u201d says Fred. Both have stressful jobs but they prioritise being together. And when they go out, they do so together. Says Burt: \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to go out with my individual mates and have a night out.\u201d Fred adds: \u201cIt\u2019s not that whole \u2018escaping the ball and chain\u2019 thing. I never feel like that. I always want Burt to be there because I know I\u2019ll have more fun.\u201d Although they occasionally argue, over the years they\u2019ve learned to adapt to the other\u2019s style. For instance, Fred likes to resolve things quickly, while Burt wants to be left alone. He\u2019s learned that if he pushes it, it just makes things worse. They\u2019re also both more able to understand the situations that stress the other one out. Being together for 10 years has given them perspective. \u201cThat\u2019s something lovely that happens from a long-term relationship,\u201d says Fred. \u201cSomeone sees you for what an idiot you are and they still accept it. Some of the fights that we used to have were so ridiculous \u2026 whereas now I don\u2019t really care.\u201d Though he used to worry about proving he was right, now he knows \u201cin two weeks\u2019 time we won\u2019t even remember it\u201d. One fight they\u2019ve never had is over money, even though one earns significantly more than the other. They share a bank account, so Burt says they\u2019ve sometimes been surprised to see other long-term couples disputing finances. \u201cThere\u2019s not one of us squirrelling away money in a private account. We never have to talk about owing each other anything or sorting out bills.\u201d Shared values, spending plenty of time and growing up together are their secrets to a long-lasting relationship. Says Fred: \u201cI do look at people that we know now, especially people that meet in their 30s and seem quite rushed to settle down because of their age, and I feel like it must be more difficult to accept each other\u2019s quirks when you\u2019re older. Whereas we\u2019ve grown up with each other and learned each other\u2019s craziness and we can handle it.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
