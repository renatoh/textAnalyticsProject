The Irishman's trademark ear-bashing was reserved for Ricardo Lopez, apparently dawdling over his distribution during Manchester United's 3-2 reserve defeat to Newcastle. Keane, his hip recovered from surgery, was making his first appearance since the 1-1 Premiership draw with Sunderland on August 31. Then, with the furore over his controversial autobiography raging in the background, he had departed the first team by spitefully crashing his right elbow into his former international team-mate Jason McAteer's head, earning the 10th red card of his career. He had three opportunities to earn United a draw, spearing them all over the bar, much to the horror of the 2,077 shivering spectators spattered around the South Stand, who generated an eerie atmosphere. There was a few straggling cries of \"Keano\" as the Irishman followed his captain for the night, Michael Stewart, on to the turf. Indeed, none of the youthful home side dared berate the Irishman when he wastefully gave away possession with his first touch. Yet, with bellowed commands echoing around the empty stands, it was clear Keane was ready for a return. Having loudly bemoaned surrendering possession to Carl Cort - stepping up his own return from injury and the scorer of the visitors' winner - which led to Newcastle's first goal, the Irishman set up the equaliser for Daniel Nardiello with a searing 25- yard drive that was spilled by Adam Collin. Keane was sharp, his box-to-box running unchecked, renewed relish in every challenge, and he probably earned a place on the United bench at Blackburn. \"I just wanted to get 90 minutes from Roy,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"That's all I required from him. He's been doing terrific training-wise, but he needed the game under his belt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
