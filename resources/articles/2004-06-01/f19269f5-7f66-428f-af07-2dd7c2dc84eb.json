One such is Saverio Mercadante's Emma (1834), here recorded for the first time. A run-of-the-mill love triangle by the librettist of Bellini's Norma, Felice Romani, the work is distinguished by its concentration on present emotions rather than their causes, leading to passions all the more overwhelming. In the title role, Nelly Miricioiu leads an excellent cast acclaimed for a recent concert performance on the South Bank, under the dapper stewardship of that ubiquitous man-about-opera, David Parry. The 3-CD set comes with an excellent 156-page commentary and translation. Shostakovich Symphony No 8 in C minor, Op. 65 WDR Sinfonieorchester K\u00f6ln/ Bychkov (Avie 0043) The second in a complete cycle of the Shostakovich symphonies and concertos for Avie, this passionate performance maintains the lustre of Semyon Bychkov's partnership with this fine German orchestra as much as his mastery of his great compatriot's music. This huge work's five movements, running to just over an hour, build with beautifully paced momentum to the most stunning of climaxes in the 15-minute allegretto, which rarely retains such logical links with the opening adagio and its three shorter interludes. Ives Symphonies 2 &amp; 3 and other orchestral works New York Philharmonic Orchestra / Bernstein (Sony Classical 5160232) (2 CDs) Bernstein's historic recordings of Ives with the New York Philharmonic, gathered here on two low-price discs, couple the second and third symphonies with 'The Unanswered Question', the Holidays Symphony and 'Central Park in the Dark', plus a bonus track featuring Bernstein discussing Ives's work. This is the first in a series of budget rereleases from Sony, including Bernstein's version of Verdi's Messa di Requiem , the Budapest String Quartet playing Beethoven's Op 18, Bruno Walter conducting Mahler's first and second symphonies, Eugene Ormandy's Carmina Burana and the complete Schumman symphonies from George Szell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
