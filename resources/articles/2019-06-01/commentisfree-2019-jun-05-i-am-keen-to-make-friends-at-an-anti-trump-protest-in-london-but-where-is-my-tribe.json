But where is my tribe?", "bodyText": "There\u2019s a light drizzle and the sky is grey and puffy. It\u2019s a Tuesday in London. I\u2019m walking down Charing Cross Road in the damp, on the way to the anti-Trump protests and wondering if The Donald himself was right: the protests are fake news, and actually, all the crowds are there to welcome him. That weekend there\u2019d been a bitter skirmish between Trump and London mayor Sadiq Khan (\u201cHe is a stone cold loser \u201d said Trump of Khan), and then on Monday a reception with the Queen, where Trump did the weird hybrid fist bump handshake thing and at dinner wore an ill-fitting white tux. Just after 11am, as I approach the National Portrait Gallery, I hear a huge cheer, whistles, bongo drums and the sounds of thousands of people chanting. My heart and steps quicken \u2013 it\u2019s definitely a protest! It\u2019s not fake news, Donald! Trafalgar Square is packed, a sea of people with signs and banners representing everyone from the NHS to the London Underground union. I\u2019m at the protest alone but am keen to make friends. I was going to march with my former landlords, Bloomsbury socialists who always had a lot of Iraq war-era protest placards stacked like kindling in the kitchen corner (\u201cNo blood for oil\u201d etc), but at the last minute they couldn\u2019t make it. I go alone, signless. Instead of a placard, I wear a cap that says SLOW in big letters. It could mean anything, but that also means I can align myself with anyone. I survey the crowds, wondering whom to attach myself to. I start the march with climate activists and stand behind a big sign that says \u201cClimate justice.\u201d Our chant is \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d \u201cClimate justice!\u201d \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d \u201cNOW!!\u201d We\u2019re not moving though, because there is some sort of bottleneck ahead. I move sideways and stand with Jewish Voices for Labour - who are chanting \u201cDump Trump!\u201d and then drift towards a more loose coalition of people holding signs that say \u201cNot even Melania likes him\u201d and a woman wearing a gold crown with a sign that reads \u201cLock him in the tower\u201d. While shuffling along chanting \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, Donald Trump\u2019s not welcome here\u201d, a wave of emotion hits me. It feels like hope. There\u2019s something about a good protest \u2013 all these people from different parts of life and disparate interest groups coming together on a rainy Tuesday \u2013 that makes me feel as if we\u2019re connected to a common cause. I march for a bit with the Communist party, then the Hackney and Shoreditch Labour party, but still I\u2019m looking for my people. There is a group I notice who seem a bit out of place. Could they be kin? None of them are carrying placards and they are following a woman wearing a blue baseball cap and an earpiece. What do these people even stand for? I wonder. I march with them for a bit, before the blue baseball cap woman veers off to one side and the group and me stand under a shelter. The woman (their branch leader?) is talking into her earpiece and looks stressed. \u201cThe police have asked that we move all our tour groups from Whitehall. It\u2019s not safe,\u201d she says. My new friends are a group on a walking tour that unwittingly got caught in one of the city\u2019s biggest protests. The people in the group are grinning at each other, amused. This is definitely more fun than watching the changing of the guard. \u201cYou\u2019ve really experienced something now,\u201d says the tour leader kind of desperately as a group with an anarchist flag marches past chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d. Whitehall is still thick with protesters, and she\u2019s taken them almost to the end of the protest towards Parliament Square, where the baby Trump blimp is expected to fly and a reggae band are playing. The tourists reabsorb themselves in the protest and I stay under the shelter and watch as a skirmish breaks out. It\u2019s not a fight where people hit each other, instead it\u2019s one where people call each other fascists or fuckwits and then film each other on their phones. Suddenly four or five police surround the group. At the centre is a man named Dave who is saying \u201cI like walls! Walls work!\u201d It turns out he is pro-Trump and explaining one of his favourite Trump policies: \u201cA prison wall works well!\u201d Protesters are surrounding him and calling him a fascist (\u201cHitler would have liked your button!\u201d) but Dave is standing firm. \u201cI think we are the majority,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see that because of the biased media.\u201d He is dismissive of the protest: \u201cYou don\u2019t see the passion in people here. Look at them!\u201d But people are passionate \u2013 so much so that the police move in and say \u201cEnough, enough, enough!\u201d when things get tense between Dave and the protesters. I approach Dave later and introduce myself. He\u2019s a British nationalist who is with some pals wearing MAGA caps. Dave is very friendly and chatty and calls me \u201clove\u201d, but I decide perhaps we\u2019re not compatible protest buddies. Where are my people??? There are a heap of placards on the side of the road, halfway up Whitehall. They look like pyre wood. I grab one with an anti-racist slogan. I\u2019m down with that. I may not have found my tribe, but I\u2019ve found my placard. \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
