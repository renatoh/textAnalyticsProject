In a rowdy and rancorous final question time for 2019, the embattled minister for emissions reduction shrugged off a request from Wolf that he formally correct the Hansard record of his first speech, where he recalled the author living \u201ca couple of doors down the corridor\u201d at Oxford in 1991, and also recounted an anecdote about graduate students, mostly from the north-east of America, \u201cdeciding we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended\u201d. Wolf insists she did not live at Oxford in 1991, and was not part of any move by students to cancel Christmas. The author contacted Taylor\u2019s office on Wednesday night in an effort to extract a correction. On Thursday she expressed astonishment that Taylor had demanded an apology from her. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m quite taken aback by what you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Wolf told the ABC on Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s very inappropriate, and very wrong.\u201d Taylor \u2013 who has been under intense pressure during the final two sitting weeks of the year because of a police investigation into a doctored document deployed in a political attack he launched against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore \u2013 was asked during the final question time why he wouldn\u2019t correct the record about Wolf. Rather than retreating and issuing a correction, Taylor dug in, although his locution was slightly different on Thursday to the description in his first speech. \u201cOf course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there,\u201d the minister told parliament. \u201cShe began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago.\u201d Taylor also demanded Wolf apologise to him for her claim that he had engaged in \u201cantisemitic dog whistling\u201d for associating her with students campaigning against Christmas. \u201cNow my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations.\u201d Wolf said on Thursday she did not live down the hall from Taylor in 1991, she lived in New York, and spent much of that year on a book tour. She also said she had never campaigned against Christmas, and she stood by her argument that the anecdote in Taylor\u2019s first speech was antisemitic. \u201cI stand by what I said.\u201d \u201cI really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn\u2019t, doing something I wasn\u2019t doing.\u201d She said to the best of her recollection she had never met Taylor. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It\u2019s up to him as an elected official to correct the record.\u201d The public fight between Taylor and Wolf came on a particularly rancorous final day in the parliament. The House of Representatives chamber was suspended briefly just before question time after Labor objected to the Morrison government gagging debate on an amended version of a union integrity bill that was defeated in the Senate last week. Labor used question time to ask the prime minister repeatedly why he believed the normal rules of accountability did not apply to him. One question put to the prime minister cited the gagging of the union bill, misleading parliament, phoning the New South Wales police commissioner during the investigation into Taylor and inviting the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston to the White House. Scott Morrison hit back, declaring it was \u201cquestion time, not smear time\u201d. He also accused Labor of attacking his Christian faith. In the melee, Taylor accused Labor of attaching itself to Wolf\u2019s \u201cantisemitic accusations\u201d and that \u201cshows just how low they\u2019re prepared to go\u201d. Labor demanded Taylor withdraw and the minister complied. In relation to the doctored document deployed against Moore, Taylor has said repeatedly, including in parliament this week, that neither he, nor \u201cany members of my staff, altered the [council] documents in question\u201d. The minister said he will cooperate with the police investigation. Federal parliament rose for the summer on Thursday night and will return next February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
