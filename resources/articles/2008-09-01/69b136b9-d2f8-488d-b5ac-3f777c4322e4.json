It's a revolution.\" Gelfand was born in the former USSR so she was not, I think, choosing her words carelessly. The tumult of recent events has indeed been remarkable. That day the Moscow Times headline was: \"Markets Post Record Single-Day Losses\" - these markets being Russia's rouble-denominated MICEX and the dollar-denominated RTS. I had heard of the impending Russian collapse at the Sotheby's pre-party for the Damien Hirst auction, earlier that week. But that auction, despite dismal predictions at the party itself, had busted through the high limit. Work was also now selling briskly at the Chocolate Factory. The mood had been similar the evening before, at a dinner for the opening of the Garage, Dasha Zhukova's new contemporary art gallery. Zhukova and her boyfriend Roman Abramovich, along with peripatetic art-worlders Samuel Keller, former director of Art Basel, British dealer Ivor Braka, Tate director Nicholas Serota and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, a consultant on the project, were seated at seven rows of tables. The talk was of the various private museums now budding worldwide. Markets were not mentioned. How strange, that Moscow of all places - with capitalism itself doggy-paddling to a changing shore - should provide the evidence that the highest of high-end contemporary art still rules. It's especially strange, because in Moscow it is such a recent growth. In the mid-1970s, a show of work by so-called \"unofficial\" artists in a Moscow park was destroyed by militiamen and bulldozers. Then, in 1988, post-perestroika, Sotheby's held a hugely successful auction in Moscow: Fundamental Lexicon, a painting by Grisha Bruskin, fetched a then-unheard-of $415,000, and the young artist was snapped up by the Marlborough Gallery in New York. It was to represent such artists that Aidan Salakhova opened Moscow's first commercial art gallery, The First Gallery. But, Salakhova says, \"I didn't sell one piece of contemporary art between 1993 and 1997.\" A serious Moscow art world began to emerge only in the late 90s. Its motors include Vladimir Seminikhin, a construction magnate with bushy, shoulder-length hair, who, in 2002, launched the Ekaterina Foundation, devoted to contemporary art. He says that in Moscow there are now maybe 100 collectors with about 50 pieces, and perhaps four with over 100. Another prime mover is Shalva Breus, a printing magnate and Russia's 127th richest man. Breus is a collector, and the publisher of a glossy magazine, Artchronika. A recent cover showed Stalin with voluptuous breasts and was headlined: \"Art After Putin: Back to the USSR?\" An earlier cover, which showed two secret policemen kissing, prevented the magazine from being exported. \"They say we are the only opposition magazine,\" Breus told me. The collector Sofia Trotsenko has also made a significant impact. In 2002, she bought a derelict former winery-cum-brewery and developed it into an \"art district\", called Winzavod. Aidan Salakhova moved her gallery there last year. \"I was the first one,\" she says. She was followed by half a dozen cutting-edge galleries, and 11 artists' studios. Trotsenko is not the only Muscovite learning from the West. Shalva Breus was inspired by the Turner prize, and last year launched the Kandinsky prize. \"Why Kandinsky?\" he asked. \"He is an international artist. He is Russian, but he is international. He is a revolutionary artist. And he is the most expensive Russian artist in the world.\" Entrants had to be Russian. There were 2,000. A jury chose the finalists: 40 art projects and 10 media projects. The work was put on show for 20 days. \"We had more than 30,000 visitors,\" Breus says. \"It was like rush hour in the subway. Unbelievable! The internet blogs were packed. All the television channels were there. And even Russian TV was talking about contemporary art. On prime-time news, they showed the opening. We had 300 million potential viewers. There were the rising prices of the art, and all the interest in that.\" Three of the shows in the Winzavod galleries are of the work of Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, who have long lived in America. These three shows - with another in the Pushkin Museum, and yet another in the Garage - celebrated their return to their former hometown. This was seen to herald the fact that Moscow, once ranked alongside Paris as an avant-garde capital, was now back in the picture. In Soviet days, Ilya Kabakov made a living illustrating children's books; but he owed the growth of his reputation to his haunting installations. An early installation, The Toilet, had been remade in Winzavod. Outside, toilet-like, there was a queue. Unusually, it was composed of art-world toffs - but, not unusually, everybody was taking too long. Inside, a table was cosily set for four, with china and cheap cutlery. There was a central stove. Along the right-hand wall were family photos, postcards, books, an old radio. Along the left-hand wall was a public lavatory, an open three-seater. Another three-seater in the second room confronted an infant's cot and a metal bed. It was like walking through a novel, a place of ghosts. Moscow's insufferable traffic made the journey to the Garage arduous, but the arrival at the bright-orange brick building was all the more captivating. Artworlders were to-ing and fro-ing. \"This is the Power Group,\" said Robert Storr, the New York curator, who was snapping away. He introduced a honcho from the Hermitage, and Grisha Bruskin of the 1988 Sotheby's sale. Joseph Kosuth, the artist, swirled by, as did Michael Stout, who runs the Basquiat foundation, Gary Tinterow of the New York Metropolitan Museum, Klaus Biesenbach of MOMA in New York, and the gallerist/consultant/auctioneer Simon de Pury. It was, in short, art world business as usual, only more so. Zhukova's former bus depot has been subdivided into several gallery spaces, each hung with canvases by Kabakov and his two surrogates, a fictive mentor, \"Charles Rosenthal\" and the supposedly 38-year-old \"Igor Spivak\". An all-white canvas by \"Rosenthal\", Empty Painting, was dated 1918. This, wittily, was the same year as Casimir Malevich's radical breakthrough, White On White. Room followed room. The walls were painted in muted colours. The floors were wood laminate. There were white tiles and pillars in the main space, and the overhead ducts were made of unpainted metal. The look was post-bling. The Red October Chocolate Factory sits in view of the Kremlin, where the Moskva river meets the Vodootvodny Canal. The Factory is currently home to the second group exhibition Larry Gagosian has put on in Moscow: called For What You Are About to Receive, it is much more ambitious than its predecessor. The work on view ran the modernist and postmodernist gamut, from two Picassos through four Giacomettis, via de Kooning, Gerhard Richter and Lucio Fontana, to younger and comparatively cheap artists such as Wade Guyton and Jim Hodges. The show was shrewdly conceived. Its focus was on the spiritual in art, a strong Russian suit, and, appropriately to a capital with many brilliantly coloured buildings, it was strong on brilliantly coloured work. A young woman was polishing a startlingly blue disc by Anish Kapoor. There was a huge Easter egg by Jeff Koons. The German artist Anselm Reyle was standing beside another vivid blue piece, explaining to a group of hacks that it was vital that his work be made \"quickly\". The young New York artist Aaron Young was standing beside the mashed-up, five-panel chain-link fence he had only finished gilding and graffiti-ing the night before. \"FIGHT OR FUCK. That's an old hippy thing,\" he said. In the evening, he directed seven bikers in the Duchampian making of a piece of abstract expressionism. He rolled his eyes when asked if he would be on wheels himself. In the absence of Larry Gagosian, questions were being handled by Victoria Gelfand from Gagosian in London, and Sam Orlovsky from its New York arm. An interpreter passed Orlovsky questions from the Muscovite press. A middle-aged woman seemed unhappy that the work was all for sale. Orlovsky explained that Gagosian was a commercial gallery and not a museum. \"May I ask a stupid question? Do you have a favourite?\" asked a Russian from the BBC. Orlovsky seemed taken aback, but finally said Richard Prince. \"And Rauschenberg,\" he added. How had the gallery put such a show together? \"Do you understand the word consignment?\" Orlovsky asked. He said that it meant approaching an artist for a piece. \"And if we make a sale we get half and the artist gets half.\" Or a collector? \"Or a collector. But they they get less than half,\" Orlovsky said, paused, and added, \"Or more.\" Russia is not like other emerging markets, he told me later. \"There's a tradition here,\" he said. \"It's in their genes. But your barrier is suspicion. Fear. People are nervous. They wonder if it's the emperor's new clothes.\" The role of the Gagosian here was \"branding\", he said, building acceptance for blue chip artists worldwide. The kneejerk response would be to smell marketing here. But that evening I was at a party to celebrate the Chocolate Factory's opening. It looked like a thronged Meccano set. There were burners, a chanteuse singing in what sounded like generic Euro. I was talking with the artist Alexander Kosolapov at the bar. He was overwhelmed by Gagosian's show. \"It's the first time we've seen this American art. It's a very intense experience,\" he said. \"To see it in Russia, it's like pieces from the moon. Or from space. Near the Kremlin and all these churches.\" Dinner was on the fourth floor. Large, square tables lined a long pillared room, lit the colour of antique ivory. Gagosian - who had at his table photographer Jean Pigozzi, New Line cinema's Bob Shaye, and Takashi Murakami, one of his most expensive artists - was marvelling at what he had put together. \"Moscow has never seen a group like this,\" somebody else told me. Gagosian was toasted in caustic New York style by the rock promoter Ron Delsener, who talked about how much money there was in Moscow, and prophesied that Gagosian would soon be having his collar felt. Gagosian thought this was hilarious, but it angered Ivor Braka, who got to his feet to snap that the evening wasn't about money - it was about art. \"He has brought Giacometti to Moscow,\" he said. Actually, both men were right. It was about the art, of course - but money, too. Earlier, I had asked Gagosian whether he believed - as I do - that the sheer size and wealth of the art world meant that there was room for more artists? \"Well, you know, what did Karl Marx say?\" he said. \"Money creates taste. I think there's a relationship. I'm not sure exactly if it's the money. But [with] the number of people collecting now, the artists feel that there is more of a potential audience critically, commercially and so on. And that draws out talent, usually. I'm not sure. I think a lot about the same thing.\" Ironically, the Chocolate Factory is about to be converted into upscale lofts. So the revolution is being co-opped. How much more New Art World can you get than that?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
