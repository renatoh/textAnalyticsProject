The constellation is most notable because of its W shape, which is said to represent the Queen sitting on her throne. She was placed in the stars as a punishment for believing that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. Some of Cassiopeia\u2019s stars vary their brightness. Gamma Cassiopeiae is spinning so fast that it flings material from its surface into space, which alters its brightness, and Delta Cassiopeiae may vary every few years because it is temporarily eclipsed by a dimmer companion star. From London, Cassiopeia is a circumpolar constellation, meaning that it can be seen all year round. Not all cultures see Cassiopeia as a Queen. Some Arabic societies saw Cassiopeia as part of a large constellation representing a camel. In the Marshall Islands, Cassiopeia\u2019s stars were incorporated into a porpoise constellation. The chart shows the view looking north-west from London at midnight on 7 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
