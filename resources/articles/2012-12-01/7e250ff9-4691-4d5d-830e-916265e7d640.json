Surely even 1962-era audiences found the setup \u2013 obliging hissing showbiz sisters Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to cohabit in passive-aggressive seclusion \u2013 borderline implausible. Yet the film remains fascinatingly warped: an extended study in decaying flesh, set to a score mordantly trying to break into Hooray for Hollywood. Aldrich sensed the terror age might wreak on those working within an industry beginning to deify youth, while awarding two seasoned troupers another chance to devour the scenery \u2013 and each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
