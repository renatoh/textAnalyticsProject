When drizzle came down at Lord's, Alesha Dixon put away her microphone and the opening ceremony was cancelled, the doom mongers who predicted the tournament would fail to catch the public imagination were sharpening their pencils. Everyone from ECB chairman Giles Clarke, praying it would help banish thoughts of a tumultuous winter, to sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe, hoping it could kick off a so-called \"golden decade\" of British sporting events in style, was looking worried. Two weeks later, it is a very different story. Outside the Oval yesterday, fans were effusive in their praise. John Fisher, sporting an England shirt, said it had been \"brilliant\" and was simply \"a great day out\". His friend Tony Koodie, backing the West Indies, added: \"It's great value for money, great entertainment. It brings in the kids, and there's a lot more women.\" They were agreed on one other thing, however: \"The dancers are dreadful!\" After that soggy opening, the sun has shone, both metaphorically and literally. Twenty20 has come of age as a sporting proposition as well as an entertainment one and, after a winter of discontent that took in the Stanford debacle and security concerns sparked by the Lahore attack on the Sri Lanka team bus, international cricket's feelgood factor is back. \"When Twenty20 started out it was a bit of a sideshow. But now it stands on its own,\" said former England player and coach David Lloyd, whose enthusiastic commentary has soundtracked Sky's coverage. \"It's been a raging success because people fill the grounds. Simple as that.\" Clarke might want to sign up the three 11-year-old boys sporting a combination of West Indies hats and Sri Lanka shirts near the Hobbs Gate to support his controversial argument that taking the pay TV shilling has helped the ECB grow grassroots cricket. Zak Chillery, Adam Stein and Ryan Davey are united in their fervour for Twenty20. \"We like watching the ball being smacked out of the park,\" says Stein, a Chris Gayle fan. \"In Twenty20, you've just got to slog it,\" adds Chillery. \"Something happens every ball.\" All three say that cricket has become more popular at their school as a result. Jag Bilkhu, a 32-year-old India fan, is on his first trip to a Test ground. \"Being a World Cup in England, I thought it would be a good one to come to.\" The three grounds chosen for the men's tournament \u2013 The Oval, Lord's and Trent Bridge \u2013 have been packed to the rafters, with more than 95% of all tickets sold. The venues are still crunching the numbers, but anecdotally they believe a fair percentage had never been inside a cricket ground before. Sky has attracted record cricket audiences for its live coverage and the BBC's late night highlights have been watched by more than 1m, despite being scheduled at 11.20pm. Around the world, and particularly in the vital Indian market, it has been hailed as a hit too. \"We knew it would grow, but the speed it grew took everyone by surprise,\" said Manu Sawhney, the managing director of Asian broadcasting giant ESPN Star Sports, the joint venture between Disney and News Corp that has invested billions in cricket rights. If the 2007 tournament in South Africa ignited the Twenty20 boom with India's victory, the 2009 one has cemented its status. \"In 2007, it came across as a flash in the pan, it was all about how swashbuckling you could be with the bat. In 2009, science has become involved.\" He said comparable ratings were well up on two years ago, despite India's early exit. Inside the grounds, games have been watched in a raucous, but always good natured, atmosphere. \"There's been great banter between the supporters but nothing malicious, not like in football,\" said Tony Koodie, a West Indies fan at The Oval yesterday. \"At the end of the game both sets of supporters will say 'well played'. You don't get that in any other sport.\" The neat trick of scheduling two matches in the same ground on a single ticket ensured both value for money and the highly unusual alchemy of having fans of all four teams, plus neutrals, within the ground. Organisers feared some fans may disappear once their team had played, but the opposite has proved true. The innovative decision to schedule the women's semi-finals and finals alongside the men's has also given the female game a boost. Riding the wave of positive press coverage following their one day World Cup win in Australia earlier this year, up to 4,000 fans watched the England team's progress at Taunton before their semi-final victory over Australia at The Oval yesterday. For tournament director and former South Africa fast bowler Steve Elworthy, the success of the tournament is the culmination of more than three years planning. Filling the grounds and creating a carnival atmosphere was the number one priority. Lessons were learned from the 1999 one-day World Cup, held in England but spread too thinly between grounds, and the interminable 2007 edition of that tournament in the West Indies, which went on forever and was played out in half full stadia. At the first World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, three games were played per day, but at different venues, making it harder to fill them.\"From our point of view, you want to capture the imagination and you want the stadiums as full as possible,\" he said. \"You want the players performing in front of full stands, and you want to make sure the training facilities are of the highest standard so that they can perform at their best.\" Players and coaches have praised both. The idea, said Elworthy, was to pack everything into a small number of grounds in a short space of time to create a buzz: \"People want more of this. There is no overkill.\" Derek Brewer, chief executive of Trent Bridge, said the full grounds were a vindication for the policy of investing heavily in Test venues to bring them into the modern era, and pouring hundreds of thousands into improving drainage. The ECB gets a flat fee of $2.5m, plus a share of ticket revenue, for hosting the tournament. The venues get to keep hospitality and catering revenues, while the ICC gets the rest. But for the England and Wales Cricket Board, the reputational boost perhaps means more than money. At a time when it is attempting to establish its place in the new cricketing world order, the commercial and cricketing success of the tournament will have done it no harm at all. Efforts were made to cater both for existing cricket fans, by marketing to the databases of the venues involved, and to reach out to non-cricket fans by releasing tickets in batches and marketing the event more widely. In order to ensure that tickets went to fans of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Elworthy's team marketed them at events attended by the Asian diaspora. At Baishakhi Mela, the largest open air festival in Europe, they set out their stall alongside the bhangra sound systems and curry stalls in Brick Lane. The gangs of lager drinking lads have been present and correct, but so too have the families and a large contingent of overseas fans. Fans have travelled from India, Ireland, Netherlands and Australia as well as less likely countries such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, Canada and Gibraltar. It was notable that when England faced India at Lord's, their fans were outnumbered by those backing the supposed visitors.Clarke, who can take succour from the success of the tournament after a tumultuous winter and ahead of a pivotal summer, promised his guests at the opening dinner that every team was sure to feel at home given the multicultural nature of the crowds. He was proved right and those leading the bid for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would have been eagerly appreciating the latest example of the UK's ability to provide a home from home for all nations. Sutcliffewho has attended several matches and will be at tomorrow's final, said the tournament's \"fantastic success\" could be a key factor in bringing other events to the UK. \"Attendances have been superb and cricket lovers supporting teams from all over the world have helped create a carnival atmosphere,\" he said. \"The tournament highlights the expertise we have in this country on putting on world class sporting events. It marks the start of what will be a great decade of sport in Britain, including the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, and we hope the rugby and football world cups.\" Brewer said it had strengthened Nottingham's resolve to win its bid to become a host city for the football World Cup. \"There have been two key factors. The quality of the people behind the scenes and the investment in the grounds. We wouldn't have been able to do this if we hadn't invested in upgrading the facilities and in drainage.\"The unpredictablity of Twenty20 cricket, with Holland dramatically defeating the hosts on the opening day and Ireland making it through to the Super Eights, has helped. So too has the athleticism and inventiveness of the best players in the world tackling the challenge of the still relatively new format with relish. In the bars, the talk has been not of dancing girls and DJs but Tillakaratne Dilshan's extravagant overhead flicks, or the slow bouncers and spin that are becoming key parts of the Twenty20 bowling armoury. Players who once treated the format as nothing more than a lucrative earning opportunity at best or a distracting sideshow at worst have queued up to praise it. \"At the beginning, there was a feeling Twenty20 would just be a slog-fest. But in the past fortnight, the bowlers have done brilliantly,\" said Lloyd. \"My theory is that the pitches have been perfect for Twenty20 with pace and bounce, which suits everyone.\" Elworthy, who led a small team mainly staffed by organisers seconded from the ECB, feels the overriding principle in balancing entertainment on the pitch with that off it was that the latter must only be triggered by the former. \"When Twenty20 started, we tended to throw the kitchen sink at it. We used every single type of activation we could think of. The interaction with the crowd, the video screens, the DJs, the dancers are all important,\" he said. \"But at the end of the day, it's what happens within the boundary that counts \u2013 the skill levels of the players, the new shots we've seen.\" Next week, the ICC will meet to discuss the future of Test cricket and will consider some of the recommendations from an ECB summit on the subject last year, including enforcing faster over rates and playing under lights. Most parties are agreed that each format of the game must be considered as a distinct entity. But they could do worse than learn from some of the marketing and presentational lessons of the last fortnight in bringing the sport to new audiences. The 50-over game, suffering from too many similar tournaments and a muddled calendar, could perhaps also do with an injection of Twenty20 thinking. \"The key thing is the legacy,\" said Elworthy. \"How do we make sure that they stay cricket fans and progress to other forms of the game?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
