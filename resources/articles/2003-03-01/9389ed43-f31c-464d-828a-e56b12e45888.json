Mr Bush urged other nations to support \"the immediate and unconditional disarmament\" of the Iraqi leader. In the face of a war that is now perhaps just hours away, the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, remained defiant following President Bush's statement from the Azores. In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, he warned that if Iraq were attacked, it would take the war anywhere in the world \"wherever there is sky, land or water.\" \"When the enemy starts a large-scale battle, he must realise that the battle between us will be open wherever there is sky, land and water in the entire world,\" Saddam told his military commanders, according to the news agency. Saddam also denied that Iraq has any weapons of mass destruction, as the US and Britain claim. \"There are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,\" he added, joking: \"Well, give us time and the necessary means and we will produce any weapon they want and then we will invite them to come and destroy them.\" In an interview on an Arabic television channel, Iraqi foreign minister Naji Sabri said Iraq had been preparing for war for months \"as if war is happening in an hour.\" \"We are preparing ourselves as if war is happening in an hour. For months we've been preparing ourselves for this possibility. Our enemy is treacherous,\" he said. France, Germany and Russia have opposed an additional UN resolution to set an ultimatum for the Iraqi leader to disarm. And efforts to win the votes of uncommitted nations at the 15-country U.N. Security Council faltered in recent days. Mr Bush, Mr Blair and the Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, met the Portuguese prime minister, Jose Durao Barroso, at an American air base in the Azores, Portuguese territory in the Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile more than 250,000 troops were gathered in the Persian Gulf area poised to strike. Mr Aznar said the agreement among the leaders marked \"a last chance, one last attempt to reach the greatest possible consensus among ourselves.\" \"We hope tomorrow the UN will do its job,\" Mr Bush said. Alternatively, he said, \"Saddam Hussein can leave the country if he's interested in peace.\" France and Russia - both permanent security council members with veto power - along with Germany are leading a campaign seeking to stop the push for military action against Iraq and urging for more time for UN weapons inspectors to do their job. Mr Bush was scornful of France's role in the diplomatic tug of war that has unfolded in recent months. Noting that he said 10 days ago he wanted the nations of the security council to show their cards, he said, \"France showed their cards. After I said what I said, they said they were going to veto anything that held Saddam to account.\" The French president, Jacques Chirac, said earlier today that he was willing to accept a 30-day deadline for Iraq to disarm, provided the move was endorsed by weapons inspectors. Speaking hours before the Azores summit got under way, President Chirac said the inspectors will be telling the security council next week that they believe it is possible to disarm Saddam Hussein peacefully. \"One month, two months, I am ready to accept any accord on this point that has the approval of the inspectors,\" Mr Chirac said in an interview with CNN. In Washington, the US vice president, Dick Cheney, brushed that suggestion aside in an appearance on NBC television, recounting a long list of French actions that he said had let Saddam avoid disarmament. Mr Blair noted that some nations oppose any ultimatum to Saddam. The result, he said, is that the Iraqi leader is playing a game that \"he has played over the last 12 years. Disarmament never happens but instead the international community is drawn into some perpetual negotiation,\" he said. \"Now we have reached the point of decision,\" he said. Mr Barroso, the Portuguese premier, called the Azores summit \"the last chance of a political solution. It may be a small chance but if there is only one chance in a million it's worth trying this opportunity.\" In Washington, the secretary of state Colin Powell said, \"Is it time to bring the curtain down on this or is there some hope?\" Mr Cheney appeared to answer the question, saying, \"There's no question but what we're close to the end, if you will, of the diplomatic efforts.\" \"Clearly, the president's going to have to make a very, very difficult and important decision here in the next few days,\" he added. House officials said last week that an address, which they said could come as early as tomorrow, was expected to serve as a final ultimatum for Saddam to disarm or face war. Today's summit also had a symbolic purpose: to show the three leaders - particularly Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, who need political cover at home for their much-criticised alliance with the US - as willing to make perhaps a final diplomatic push to win international backing for war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
