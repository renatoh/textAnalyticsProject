Much as I'd love to stay and chat, I must depart in order to record another episode of our World Cup Daily podcast with James Richardson and others, who will get the hump if I keep them waiting. Make sure to sign up and download on iTunes or SoundCloud, or simply listen to it on the website when Producer Ben has edited it into coherence and it goes up in few hours. Thanks for your company and enjoy the two-day break from the football. Wow! Hats off to Belgium, who ensure that for the first time in World Cup history (since the introduction of eight groups, at least), all eight table-toppers go through to the quarter-finals. If you get the opportunity to see highlights of this encounter, make sure you do, because there so much going on out there in Salvador tonight that not even the world's greatest court stenographer could have done it justice in a minute-by-minute report such as this. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeep! It's all over. Belgium are through. By the skin of their teeth, Belgium have prevailed in one of the greatest football matches I have ever seen. Romelu Lukaku turned the game, but USA deserve immense credit for their contribution. They will be devastated, but can be very proud of themselves. Their energy levels, their desire, their dedication and their refusal to give up were simply astonishing. ET29:What is Romelu Lukaku doing? He wins the ball a bit inside the USA half and tries to thread a through-ball through the defence instead of charging for the corner, where he can shield the ball and run down the clock. The USA charge forward again, where Yedlin brings a save out of Courtois. He's been astonishingly good since coming on. ET28:Jermaine Jones floats an other cross into the Belgium penalty area from the right, which Belgium clear. ET26:Jones shoots from distance when he probably should have crossed. Moments previously, Yedlin had gone close. Or was it somebody else going close from another fine Yedlin cross? I'm not sure, to be honest - such is the relentless American attacking that I'm struggling to keep up. If there's any justice in the world, they'll nab an equaliser here. ET23: Courtois denies Clint Dempsey with a fine save as the USA almost pull off a well excuted training ground move after winning a free-kick outside the Belgium pernalty area, straight in front of goal. It's a bit too far for anyone to try a shot, so Bradley plays it diagonally along the ground to Yedlin, who flicks it back into the path of Dempsey, who'd made a run towards goal. Courtois rushes off his line and drops on the ball. That would have been a splendid, splendid goal. ET21: Belgium substitution: the fairly fresh Eden Hazard is taken off, having done next to nothing, while Marouane Fellaini and Axel Witsel, who both look shattered, look on enviously. The Belgian fans voice their disapproval as Hazard makes way for Nacer Chadli. ET20: Romelu Lukaku goes marauding again, bringing another decent save out of Tim Howard, who saves with his feet. ET18: Yedlin sends in a wonderful cross from the corner flag and it's knocked down at the far post. It bounces slightly too high for Jermaine Jones, who sort of pirouettes before sticking the ball inches wide with the outside of his right foot. That was so close. ET17: Sweet baby Jesus and the angels! Would you believe it? The substitute shows perfect technique as he gets on the end of a fine pass from Bradley and volleys home with his toe from seven or eight yards after latching on to a dinked pass over the top. This match is not over yet! Astonishing stuff. Half-time in extra time: There's no messing around as the referee orders the teams to switch sides and restart immediately. USA have made a substitution: Julian Green on for Alejandro Bedoya. ET 15: Prior to that goal, in the move that led to Jermaine Jones getting whacked in the face with the ball, the USA actually had a chance. DaMarcus Beasley squared a low cross into the Belgium penalty area, where Toby Alderwiereld performed heroics to prevent the ball getting across the edge of the six-yard box on to the toe of Clint Dempsey. ET15:A raking pass is played wide to De Bruyne on the left flank and he remains composed, holding it up before playing the ball between Cameron and Besler for Lukaku to gallop - and I mean gallop - on to. He scorches down the left side of the penalty area and rifles the ball past Tim Howard. ET11:Kevin De Bruyne accidentally hoofs the ball into the face of Jermaine Jones, who goes down like a sack of spuds. He's soaked in sweat with his socks down around his ankles; you'd say he's suffered enough without that. De Bruyne immediately apologiese and after some treatment and a drink of water, Jones is fit to continue. ET10:Lukaku brings another save out of Tim Howard. He's running riot among these knackered Americans, who simply can't contain him in their fatigued state. ET8: America get the ball out of their own half, with Bradley, Jones and Yedlin combining. This isn't right: where's Lukaku? Why hasn't he stopped them? USA get the ball to the edge of the Belgium penalty area, where Jones tries a shot. The ball comes off Vertonghen and doesn't quite break for Dempsey, who gets it caught under his feet when it looked like he might have a clear sight of goal. ET6:Lukaku brings a good save out of Tim Howard, shooting low, hard and diagonally, forcing the goalkeeper to scramble the ball around the post for a corner. Nothing comes of it. ET5:What an impact by Lukaku. After setting up the first goal, he plays the ball into space for Vertonghen on the edge of the penalty area. Not quite sure what to do, the full-back dithers at ridiculous length, allowing assorted USA defenders to get back and block Vertonghen's shot when he eventually decides to pull the trigger. ET2: Kevin De Bruyne slots the ball into the bottom left-hand corner after running on to a pull-back from Lukaku, who won the ball down by the right touchline after shrugging off Besler and galloped into the penalty area before squaring the ball. ET1: Belgium substitution: Romelu Lukaku has replaced Divock Origi. You have to feel for Matt Besler and Omar Gonzalez - if I was a centre-half who was mentally and physically drained after an attritional 90 minutes, I can't think of anyone I'd rather have to mark less than a fresh-off-the-bench Lukaku with a point to prove. USA have been wonderful tonight. Almost to a man, their largely ordinary players have given everything tonight, wringing out every last drop of effort for the good of the collective. Belgium have had a touch more class, but so many of their big names have under-performed. Fellaini has done little or nothing, Hazard hasn't done much more and De Bruyne has gone very quiet after a good first half. Full time: The referee blows his whistle and it's all square at the end of normal time. I'm not quite sure how nobody has scored, but there you have it - we'll have another 30 minutes, with penalties if it's still deadlocked after that. 90+2 min: Wondolowski gets on the end of a looping backwards header to smash a volley high and wide of a practically open goal from six yards. His blushes are spared by the linesman's flag, but replays show that Toby Alderweireld was playing him on. That was an appalling miss and an appalling decision from the man with the flag. 90 min:Belgium take their 15th and 16th corners of the match. Fellaini gets a head to one of them, but fails to score. 89 min: Vincent Kompany gallops out of his own defence with the ball, passes it wide to Kevin De Bruyne on the left and continues his run to pick up the return pass. It comes to him on the edge of the six-yard box, but is straight under his feet, rather than a yard or two ahead of him. He fluffs his shot and the ball, which was going wide anyway, is put out for a corner. 87 min: Eden Hazard shoots into the side-netting after being teed up by Kevin De Bruyne down the inside left. It was on his left foot and he was running away from goal, making it night on impossible for him to score, but he decided to have a go anyway. If he'd checked his run and crossed, a couple of his team-mates were waiting in the centre. 86 min: USA corner. Alejandro Bedoya takes it. His delivery is cleared at the near post by Witsel. 85 min: The corner's sent to the far post, where Fellaini leaps highest but only head it out of the shoulders of his marker. The referee mistakenly awards a goal-kick. 84 min: Origi picks up the ball on the edge of the USA penalty area, shimmies a couple of steps to his right and unleashes a surface to air screamer. Tim Howard tips it over the bar to concede the corner. 82 min: Daniel van Buyten shapes to shoot in the USA penalty area, but Matt Besler slides in with a heroic block to concede the corner. Nothing comes of it. 80 min: Bradley plays the ball down towards the corner flag, where the excellent Yedlin, who had sauntered past Hazard to get the ball and put a cross in. The ball is cleared as far as Hazard about 40 yards from his own goal, where Yedlin pops up to rob him of possession. 78 min:Super save from Tim Howard, who dives low to his left to keep out an Eden Hazard drive from outside the penalty area after Marouane Fellaini had laid off a ball into the box from Mirallas, who's been exceptional since he came on. Hazard had the accuracy, but not the power, which gave Howard a chance of saving it which he took gratefully. 77 min:USA centre-back Omar Gonzalez goes down and appears to roll his ankle.He receives treatment and looks fit to continue. 76 min: Origi plays a short pass in behind the USA defence for Kevin Mirallas, who attempts to roll it past Tim Howard and into the bottom right-hand corner. Tim Howard spreads himself and gets something on it to put the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. The USA are really under the cosh here. 74 min:Good defending from Vertonghen, who does well to clear a dinked pass in the direction of Jermaine Jones. 72 min: Origi squanders another great chance for Belgium, fluffing a shot and firing straight at Tim Howard when he had no end of gaping goal to aim at. USA substitution: Zusi off, looking shattered. He's replaced by Chris Wondolowski. 70 min: Having said that, he'll probably end up scoring the winner, in the fine tradition of players who are having a bad day at the office in this round of games popping up with late winners. Yes you, Mesut Ozil. And you, Angel Di Maria. Alternatively, Eden Hazard is a likely contender. He's done little or nothing this evening. 69 min: The USA are starting to look tired and Graham Zusi needs to be withdrawn because he's looking a bit of a liability on the left side of midfield. 68 min: After patient Belgian build-up play, Axel Witsel strikes from about 25 yards. H\"is diagonal daisy-cutter zips wide of the left upright. 68 min: The same, only with Toby Alderweireld doing the crossing and Tim Howard doing the plucking. I said plucking. 67 min: USA attack down the right wing, courtesy of DeAndre Yedlin. He sends in another good cross, which Thibaut Courtois plucks from the air under pressure from Clint Dempsey. 65 min: Axel Witsel picks up the ball on the right flank and plays a short pass to Eden Hazard. It's fed wide to Vertonghen, who crosses it into the penalty area. The USA clear. 63 min: Jan Vertonghen, who's being given the freedom of the pitch by Graham Zusi, shoots from distance. Tim Howard dives forward and smothers the ball to his chest, but only on his second attempt. 62 min: Kevin De Bruyne has a shot blocked by Omar Gonzalez. 59 min: Origi makes a darting run down the inside left and picks out Mertens with a pass to the near post. He flicks it wide from close range and a near impossible angle. Belgium substitution: Kevin Mirallas on, Dries Mertens off. 58 min:Graham Zusi has a shot blocked. 57 min: Vertonghen attempts to score with a ridiculously ambitious volley from the left hand side of the USA penalty area. The ball slaloms in mid-air before fizzing high and wide. That would have been one of the greatest goals of all time if it had gone in. 56 min: Origi leaps to get on the end of a cross from the right and his header looks to be heading for the top right-hand corner. With Tim Howard beaten, the ball bounces off the top of the cross-bar. Close, but no cigar. 54 min: Brilliant play from Jan Vertonghen, who squares the ball across the face of the USA six-yard box, where it's just begging to be prodded home. Origi doesn't react quickly enough, then the ball rolls through DeBruyne's legs. That is astonishing; how did either, never mnind both of them miss?!?!?!? 53 min: Belgium ratchet up the pressure on the USA with a prmising attack, then de-ratchet it by passing the ball back into their own half, where their defenders pass it around. It's been a slow start to this half. Certainly a lot less lively than the one that went before. 52 min: Fellaini wins the ball about 40 yards from the USA goal, advances a few yards and tries a shot. High and wide. 50 min: I may have been a bit hard on Tim Howard two posts ago. A replay suggests he may have lost his bearings and tipped the ball over the bar just to be on the safe side. 48 min: Dries Mertens takes the corner and once again, for the fourth or fifth time in this match, his delivery is dreadful. 47 min: Kevin De Bruyne dinks the ball into the USA penalty area, where Dries Mertens attempts to send a looping header past Tim Howard. The USA goalkeeper pulls off a save for the cameras, needlessly and extravagantly tipping the ball over the bar, when it looked eminently catchable. 46 min: Marouane Fellaini hacks clear after Graham Zusi attempts to make his way into the Belgium penalty area from the right flank. Second half: Belgium get the second half started, with no changes on either side. A question from David Wall \"Are Belgium suffering in this tournament from Wilmots's supposed lack of tactical know-how?\" he asks. \"From what I've read his big achievement was uniting a traditionally fractious dressing room. But he seems to have too many options and doesn't know how or who he thinks his side should play from one game to the next, and the Belgians seem less assured and confident in what they're trying to do as you'd expect given the talent of their players. Can a coach really have too many options?\" Some half-time commentary from our readers \"Perhaps if Jurgen Klinsmann knew how to ask for a yellow card in French?\" muses Scott Martin. \"While you are writing 'soccer' in quotation marks (excuse me, 'inverted commas') to mock Americans' knowledge of the game, you might recall that it's a British contraction of the British expression 'Association Football',\" writes Peter C. Andersen. Well, Peter, I wasn't mocking anyone - a lot of Americans, including their president, were genuinely bewildered by the fact that their defeat at the hands of Germany was a \"good\" result. In fact lots of Irish people refer to football as \"soccer\" as well, to distinguish the sport from gaelic football, a bizarre game in which players are allowed to use their hands to field the ball, punch each other in the face and wrestle each other to the ground. \"An elderly, non-soccerwatching neighbor here in Philadelphia has just seen Fellaini on the ball and asked me whether the team mascot always gets to 'suit up and play at the World Cup'. I told her that Belgium were sponsored by McDonalds, which she seems happy enough with!\" writes Justin Kavangh. It's half-time: Well, that was lively first half. There's been no goals, but lots of entertainment and plenty of chances for both teams in Salvador. 45+1 min: Booking from a couple of minutes ago I haven't had a chance to mention yet: Vincent Kompany was yellow carded for an ill advised challenge on Clint Dempsey. 45 min:Kevin De Bruyne attempts to catch Tim Howard unawares with a long-range volley. The USA goalkeeper is wise to his ruse and is not troubled unduly. 44 min: Zusi wins a corner off Jan Vertonghen and takes it himself. Gonzalez leaps highest but fails to make contact with the ball and Belgium clear. 43 min: Belgium win a corner. Kevin De Bruyne sends the ball into the penalty area, where Tim Howard clears with both fists. 40 min: But for some atrocious finishing, it could be about 4-4 here by now. Once again, the substitute DeAndre Yedlin burns rubber down the right flank and beats the hopefully exposed Vertonghen for speed again, sends in a low cross only to see Jermaine Jones fluff his shot. On BBC's coverage, pundit Danny Murphy rips into Eden Hazard for failing to provide any cover for Vertonghen. 39 min: A foul by Alejandro Bedoya gives Belgium a free-kick halfway inside the USA territory, on the right flank. Dries Merten sends the ball into the penalty area, but his delivery is woeful. The USA clear. 38 min: Yedlin sends in a decent cross from the right, but it's a mite too high for Graham Zusi. Belgium clear. 36 min: Jurgen Klinsmann waves an imaginary yellow card at referee Djamel Haimoudi in a bid to get one of the Belgian players booked for a fairly innocuous foul. Classy. 35 min:Mexican wave klaxon: there is a Mexican wave doing the rounds of the stadium. Is this end-to-end match not exciting enough for the fans, who feel compelled to make their own fun? Bah! Belgium advance again, but Eden Hazard runs into a wall of white shirts on the edge of the USA penalty area and Belgium clear. 32 min: The corner comes in, and Clint Dempsey chests it down beautifully to Jermaine Jones outside the area. He tries a shot, but doesn't get hold of it properly and pulls his low, fairly feeble drive wide. 31 min: Yedlin makes an instant impact, showing great speed down the right to win a corner off Eden Hazard. 30 min: Bad news for the USA: Fabian Johnson, who was playing well at right-back, has pulled up with a hamstring injury (disclaimer: I'm no doctor etc, and so on). He's replaced by DeAndre Yedlin, who plays for Seattle Sounders in MLS. 29 min: Origi finds himself in space on the left for Belgium and cuts inside, only to try to do too much himself and make life easy for Tim Howard. 27 min:Eden Hazard sprints down the inside left with the ball at his feet and wins a corner for Belgium; their sixth of the match thus far. It's swung into the penalty area, where Joohnson heads clear, sending Zusi on his way into the Belgium half. He plays it forward to Dempsey, who is thwarted by good defending from Toby Alderweireld, the last man back. 25 min: Another bad miss for Belgium, who are threatening to run amok. With Belgium hopelessly exposed at the back, Jan Vertonghen tries to pick out the unmarked Marouane Fellaini with a cross that he left a smidge too late, enabling DaMarcus Beasley to get back and frantically hack the ball clear. This is another fine game of football at World Cup 2014. 22 min: A shocking miss from Kevin De Bruyne, who pulls the ball a foot or two wide of the left upright from about 10 yards out, with the goal gaping. Graham Zusi lost the ball in midfield, prompting Belgium to swarm into the American half, with Jan Vertonghen leading the charge with the ball at his feet. With a range of options to choose from, he picked out De Bruyne, whose finish was nothing short of dreadful. 20 min: From the corner, Belgium break at high speed and have a three-on-two, only for Origi to mess it up by squandering possession with a heavy touch, when he had two men screaming for the ball in acres of space on his left. America attack again and Clint Dempsey brings a save out of Thibaut Courtois from inside the penalty area, who would have been in big trouble had the American captain not got the ball caught under his feet. 19 min: Fabian Johnson beats Jan Vertonghen for speed down the right flank again and wins his team a corner. Graham Zusi sends the ball into the mixer, where Cameron gets a flick with his head, but the ball doesn't break kindly for Clint Dempsey. 17 min: The match resumes and Geoff Cameron picks up a yellow card for a silly, unnecessary challenge on Dries Mertens. Disciplinary tightrope klaxon: Geoff Cameron is walking the disciplinary tightrope. 15 min: Pitch invader alert! There is an invader on the pitch. He's removed by stewards as Jurgen Klinsmann shakes his head in the wya you're father might do when he catches you coming home a bit too drunk, while Marc Wilmot settles for giving the interloper the stink-eye. 14 min: Origi is fit to continue, in a state of affairs that will disappoint USA fans. Belgium win a throw-in on the halfway line, with Fellaini kicking the ball out of play off Jermaine Jones. 13 min: A USA throw-in, deep in Belgium territory. Belgium win the ball back and embark on a counter-attack. Divock Origi goes down injured inside his own half after being caught late by Matt Besler and there's a pause while he receives treatment. 10 min: Jermaine Jones concedes a free-kick halfway inside his own half, from which Belgium win a throw-in. Toby Alderwiereld hurls it long for Marouane Fellaini and Geoff Cameron gives away a needless corner after a mix-up with his goalkeeper. Nothing comes of it; a foul by Alderweireld on Beasley gifts a free-kick to the Americans. 8 min: For the USA, right-back Fabian Johnson shows an impressive turn of foot to beat Vertonghen down the flank, but the ball is even quicker and rolls out of play for a Belgium goal kick before he can control or cross it. 7 min: Belgium go on the counter-attack after Jan Vertonghen broke up an Amercian attack on the fringe of his own penalty area and moved forward. He picks out Kevin De Bruyne, who tries to thread a through-ball in behind the USA defence and send Origi on his way. It's blocked and the attack is foiled. 6 min: DaMarcus Beasley surges down the left flank and attempts to get in a cross from the byeline. Under pressure from Marouane Fellaini, his effort goes high and wide. It's been a lively, promising start. 5 min: A promising USA attack breaks down when Michael Bradley gallops through the centre with the ball at his feet, before misplacing a fairly straightforward pass towards Clint Dempsey on the left flank. 2 min:Nothing comes from the corner, but Belgium win another one moments later. The USA clear. They're under the cosh from the get go! Origi showed searing pace in the opening seconds and will be cursing himself for not opening the scoring. That was a wonderful chance; he was clean through on goal with only Tim Howard to beat. 1 min: Belgium win a corner after Divock Origi almost opens the scoring for Belgium after 42 seconds. He caught one of the USA centre-backs - Besler, I think - napping, got in behind him and fired a low, hard diagonal shot at Tim Howard, who did well to block the ball and put it out for a corner. USA kick-off:Clint Dempsey does the honours, with the team he skippers playing from right to left. Omar Gonzalez gets an early touch and it seems Geoff Cameron has lined up in the centre of midfield. Not long now: The teams have emerged from the tunnel and lined up either side of referee Djamel Haimoudi and his team of match officials. Belgium's anthem is played first. Next up it's the Star Spangled Banner. Amercia's players wear white shirts, shorts and socks. Belgium's are kitted out in red shirts with gold and black trim, red shorts and red socks. USA line-up It seems they'll play a 4-3-3, with Johnson at right-back and Beasley at left-back, book-ending a centre-half pairing of Gonzalez and Besler. Cameron will play right midfield, with Michael Bradley in the centre and Jones on the left. Up front it's Bedoya on the right and Jones on the left, with Dempsey up front. Obviously that could be cobblers, but time will tell. Just to be absolutely clear I know there are some Americans out there who are relatively new to the game of \"soccer\", so lest there be any confusion after your magnificent, triumphant and heroic defeat at the hands of Germany, be aware that if you lose tonight's match you are definitely out of the tournament. As things stand ... Seven group winners have won the first seven second round matches. Should Belgium proceed tonight, they'll complete a clean sweep of table-toppers in the quarter-finals. Nobody who isn't Belgium wants that, do they? Do they? Apparently this guy isn't being sarcastic Buzz-killers criticising other people for being at bars at any time for any reason, maybe evaluate the life decisions that led you to this place. It's not compulsory, dude. You don't have to join them if you don't want to. Obviously I do want to join them but can't, because I'm in work and it stopped being 2.30pm on a Tuesday here in Blighty six hours ago. Bah! Tip of the hat to Phil Rhodes for the heads up. I've done some investigative journalism What, no Kyle Beckerman? The USA's dred-headed defensive midfielder is conspicuous by his absence tonight and I'm not sure why. According to USA football journalist Grant Wahl he's fit, but just not selected. I presume it's Stoke City's Geoff Cameron, who is no mug, who comes in ahead of him. That's a surprise, as far as I can tell, but presumably J\u00fcrgen knows best. Belgium: 1-Thibaut Courtois; 2-Toby Alderweireld, 4-Vincent Kompany, 15-Daniel Van Buyten, 5-Jan Vertonghen; 6-Axel Witsel, 8-Marouane Fellaini; 14-Dries Mertens, 10-Eden Hazard, 7-Kevin De Bruyne; 17-Divock Origi United States: 1-Tim Howard; 3-Omar Gonzalez, 23-Fabian Johnson, 5-Matt Besler, 7-DaMarcus Beasley, 20-Geoff Cameron; 19-Graham Zusi, 11-Alejandro Bedoya, 4-Michael Bradley, 13-Jermaine Jones; 8-Clint Dempsey Referee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria) Team news (warning: may not be accurate) So now we know. Argentina scraped past Switzerland, with Lionel Messi teeing up Angel Di Maria to score the winner in the breath-taking climax of an otherwise dire match in S\u00e3o Paulo earlier. They'll take on the winner of this match in Brasilia on Saturday. Early team news Thomas Vermaelen has been ruled out of this evening's match with a hamstring injury, but Vincent Kompany is expected to line up for Belgium whether fully fit or not after missing Thursday's win over South Korea with a groin problem. Anthony Vanden Borre is out for the rest of tournament having suffered a broken ankle, while Steven Defour is suspended. Having missed out on the USA's last two games, Jozy Altidore is reported to have recovered from a hamstring strain sustained against Ghana but is unlikely to start this evening. Belgium national anthem USA national anthem Meet tonight's referee His name is Djamel Haimoudi, he's from Algeria and in a stunt that seemed so laughably transparent it could have come from the big book of Bullying Tactics Masquerading As Fiendishly Clever Mind Games, written by Sir Alex Ferguson and eagerly devoured by idiots everywhere, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has already voiced his irritation at the official's appointment ... while simultaneously attempting to convey the impression that he has no problem with it at all. Obviously I wasn't at the press conference in question and therefore don't know the exact context in which the comments were uttered, but they seemed a bit rum to me. \u201cWe know that he did already two games so far, and he did them very well, so we wish that he continues his refereeing the perfect way he\u2019s done so far,\u201d Klinsmann said, shortly before or after saying the appointment of Haimoudi is a source of concern, because he refereed matches in Belgium's group and will be able to speak French to their players. Quite what Klinsmann thinks he'll be conversing with them about remains unclear. Presumably it's the fact that he won't know that is the cause of his concern.

The Fifa guide to Belgium Featuring interviews with Jan Vertonghen, Marc Wilmots and Eden Hazard, plus some fascinating statistics regarding chocolate production, beer and the origin of chips. Good evening (BST) everybody. Welcome to our minute-by-minute coverage of the final second round match of World Cup 2014: Belgium v USA at Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador, a stadium that has yielded a whopping 21 goals from just four games at this World Cup thus far. It's good news for those who bet on high goal-tallies (you can get 7/2 against there being more than three in 90 minutes tonight) and even better news for Mother Nature, with organisers of a project in Bahia having promised to plant 1,111 trees in the Atlantic Forest, located in the south of the state of Bahia, for every goal scored at the stadium during the tournament. With the forest having shrunk to an eighth of its original size, the initiative is good news for the local environment, but bad news for local industries who have agreed to sponsor it. \"As they've scored quite a lot of goals already, we need more trees and so are looking for new partners \u2013 including the national teams and even players themselves,\" said Patricia Mazoni, a consultant for the Gol Verde (Green Goal) project. Kick-off in Salvador is at 9pm (BST), but I'll be here with all the team news and build-up to this evening's 0-0 draw for an hour or more before that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
