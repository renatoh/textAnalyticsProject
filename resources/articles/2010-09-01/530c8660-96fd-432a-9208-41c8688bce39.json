Low-cost housing must be there for those who need it \u2013 but with several hundred billion pounds tied up in social housing nationally, it is right to ask if we are using these resources well. If we have to put up a \"no vacancies\" sign because that housing is largely tied up in lifetime tenure \u2013 regardless of changes in family need, or household income \u2013 then we may be disproportionately benefiting our long-term sitting tenants at the expense of those in real need. The price they pay is scarring years, or decades, in cramped hostels or B&amp;Bs, or insecure private-rent. If we accept that low-cost housing is a right for life, once in, then the way to help those newly in need is to build much more social housing, and we should. But this doesn't answer the long-term question: what do we do when that fills up too? This coalition government is exactly the right place to debate such issues.

Is it not therefore time to ask what will be the likely effect on a fragile housing market of the severe curbs on housing benefit proposed by the chancellor?
