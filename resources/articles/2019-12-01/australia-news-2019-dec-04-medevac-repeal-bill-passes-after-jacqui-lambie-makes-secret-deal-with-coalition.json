The medical evacuation law, which was passed against the government\u2019s will in the last sitting week of 2018, will be scrapped after Lambie joined One Nation senators and sided with the government in the Senate on Wednesday morning. The government won the vote to repeal the law 37 votes to 35. Lambie told the Senate she had made a \u201creally hard decision\u201d to support the legislation\u2019s repeal, but had done so because the government had agreed to an \u201coutcome\u201d that would improve medical treatment for refugees held in offshore detention. She has refused to disclose details of the proposal she put to government. \u201cI can\u2019t let the boats start back up and I can\u2019t let refugees die, whether it\u2019s sinking into the ocean or waiting for a doctor, and I am voting to make sure that neither of these things happen,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked to an outcome I believe we both want, which is an outcome that our borders are secure, the boats have stopped and sick people aren\u2019t dying waiting for treatment. And as a result of that work \u2026 I am more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.\u201d Lambie said that while she did not believe medevac posed a national security threat, there were \u201creal problems with the way it\u2019s operating\u201d. \u201cThere are problems that sit at the centre of its operation. They cannot be amended away. The Labor party and the Greens might think everything is A-OK, but I\u2019m not comfortable with it.\u201d A tearful Lambie said she was not being \u201ccoy or silly\u201d by not revealing details of her proposal, saying it was a national security concern. \u201cI know that\u2019s frustrating to people, and I get that. I don\u2019t like holding things back like this. But when I say I can\u2019t discuss it publicly due to national security concerns, I am being 100% honest to you. \u201cMy hand is on my heart and I can stand here and say that I would be putting at risk Australia\u2019s national security and national interest if I said anything else about this.\u201d She apologised to those who would be disappointed by her decision, but said she had considered what she could do to improve the system. \u201cDo I repeal the legislation or let it sit there? Not as perfect as the activists would have you believe, but not as terrible as the media loudmouths would have you believe either,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cI did not accept that we could just go back to the way things used to be and I asked myself how we\u2019d have to do things differently.\u201d Lambie has been in talks with the government since Monday after she presented a non-negotiable demand in order to secure her support to repeal the laws, which will now see powers of refusal for medical transfers fully restored to home affairs minister Peter Dutton. While she has refused to disclose details of her demand, Lambie did not deny reports that she wanted the government to accept an offer from New Zealand to accept 150 refugees from Australia\u2019s offshore detention network. Labor and the Greens lambasted the deal, calling for details of the \u201csecret deal\u201d to be made public. Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally said the parliament and the Australian people \u201chave a right to know\u201d what had been agreed to. \u201cWhat is the secret deal? There\u2019s been a deal between the Morrison government and senator Lambie to drive a stake through the heart of medevac, and they\u2019re keeping it secret from this parliament and from the Australian public,\u201d Keneally told the Senate. \u201cWill it start the boats again? Will this secret deal undermine national security? Or will this secret deal follow through on a better result for the people who are held in regional processing centres in Manus and Nauru? We simply don\u2019t know.\u201d The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, denied there had been a secret agreement struck with Lambie. \u201cObviously, the Labor party doesn\u2019t believe that anybody can be persuaded by a good argument,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cThe Labor party thinks that anything, whenever we are able to persuade anyone, the Labor party just assumes there must be some secret deal \u2013 there is no secret deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no change to our strong border protection arrangements, there will be no change to our strong national security arrangements, and there will be no change in the way we deal with the legacy caseload that Labor left behind when you were last in government.\u201d On Monday, Cormann told the ABC that the government would \u201cnot be horse trading on national security.\u201d Government sources were adamant that no deal had been done, saying Lambie had been given thorough, classified briefings about the government\u2019s current approach to resettlement and it was on this basis that she had agreed to repeal the law. The Greens senator Nick McKim said it was a \u201cdark day\u201d for the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark day for the majority of Australians who support the medevac legislation, it\u2019s a dark day for the Senate, which is being asked to make a decision, shrouded in secrecy without all of the information in our hands,\u201d McKim said. \u201cBut do you know who this is the darkest day for? It\u2019s the darkest day for those people who remain in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. That\u2019s who this is the darkest day for because, under medevac, they could have confidence that if they had a medical condition so significant \u2026 that they needed to come to Australia for treatment, that is what would happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
