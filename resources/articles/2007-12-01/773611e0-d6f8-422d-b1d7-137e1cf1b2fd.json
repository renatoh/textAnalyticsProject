No preview tapes were available, but we're promised interviews with former contestants and a bit in which the current judges \"share their backstage secrets\". Including, one imagines, how they've managed to resist the temptation to throw gravy in Bruce Forsyth's eyes and/or set fire to his chin. EastEnders 8pm, BBC1 \"Cars are cars,\" warbled Paul Simon on his 1983 track, Cars Are Cars. Alas, the tiny philosopher was warbling out of his exhaust pipe. Cars are not cars. They are wheeled harbingers of doom; spluttering portents of a future with even more Jeremy Clarkson in it. In Albert Square, however, they're worse. Much worse. \"THEY'RE DEFF TRAPS!\" splutters Kevin, appalled by Phil's collection of cut-and-shut monstrosities. With Yolande expressing interest in the \u00a339.99 \"Ford Escort\", (c)armageddon surely awaits. Johnny Goes to Scotland 8pm, BBC2 Johnny Kingdom decamps to the Highlands of \"Scawddlin\" for more vaguely unsettling wildlife action. Here, he finds aristocrat Sir John Lister-Kaye, who greets the arrival of the outdoors expert and his maverick vowels not in the manner one would expect (diving behind a hedgerow with his fingers in his ears), but by letting him trudge around his enormous estate in a leisure suit embossed with photos of leaves. Among the scampering blurs captured by his long lens: some beavers, stags, an otter, and Sir John Lister-Kaye, peering ruefully at a hedgerow. Scawddlin, one imagines, may need some time to recover. Johnny Cash in San Quentin 9pm, Sky Arts Shot by Granada in 1969, this pensive little film charts the Man in Black's legendary performance at the titular penitentiary. Eschewing narration, captions and every last sequin of showbiz puff in favour of episodic concert footage and unflinching interviews with anonymous inmates, it offers a compassionate meditation on the nature of redemption and hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
