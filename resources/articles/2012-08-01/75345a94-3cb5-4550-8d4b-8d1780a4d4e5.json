Unbridled joy from crowds gathered in the centre of Kingston grew louder with every second as the powerful strides of world's fastest man took him to the finish line. Bolt's early birthday present to his country, delivered in a blistering 9.63 seconds, was exactly what hundreds, including many who had journeyed from the sprinter's parish of Trelawny, had come to watch together on a big screen. Traffic in the Jamaican capital came to a standstill as people, braving the cold and rain of Tropical storm Ernesto, sounded horns and clanged pot covers. Others mimicked the now famous pose of the double Olympic champion or cheered each appearance of his compatriot Yohan Blake, who many considered as Bolt's main rival going into the race but who finished a respectable second with a time of 9.75 seconds. The passion was just as great closer to the scene of Bolt's historic feat last night:at the Jamaica House \u2013 bit of the Caribbean island created at the 02 in North Greenwich which has operated as a base for Jamaican fans. Bolt triggered an endless blanket of noise and hysteria; the sort of carefree jumping and proclaiming usually reserved for the spirit filled pews of a Pentecostal assembly. The moment the gun was fired, the crowd chanted and brayed and hooted and they didn't stop until he was safely home. They cheered for their man apart, and then for his compatriot and rival Blake. Just as lustily, they booed the American runners \u2013 vanquished in less than 10 seconds. \"I am so happy,\" said Rosa Nelson, 37, from Edmonton, north London, pausing to mimic Bolt's trademark archery stance. \"He represents a small nation, the best of our small nation presenting itself to the world. We have the fastest man and the fastest woman. We are confident and we are proud and now we are even prouder.\" \"It was so important,\" said Dwayne Shann, 32, from south-east London. \"There is a lot of negativity about. This is optimism. We need to build on this, move forward.\" \"This was never just a race,\" added Donna Dedasee, 50, a teacher from Leytonstone, in east London. \"It brings us together and shows that for all the bad things people say about black people and Jamaicans, we have many good things to show the world.\" Since the opening of Jamaica House on Friday, those feasting on jerk pork and rum cocktails had been awaiting the final with a steely focus. Saturday's 100 metre gold retention by Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was a source of pride, but it was just the start. The desire for a country of just 2.9 million people to be recognised as unassailable \u2014 if only on the 100 metre track \u2013 required total victory in the men's event. In the Kingston crowd, Damion Brown said: \"Usain take over from Bob Marley. It was Bob that was Jamaica hero, Now it is Usain.\" \"Let me tell you this, he is the best, the best you hear me, none of them not even Yohan can touch him,\" added Mark Green. \"We are so proud right now. Happy Jamaica 50.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
