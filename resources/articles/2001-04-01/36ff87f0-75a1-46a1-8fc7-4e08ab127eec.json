It's almost as if he's forgotten how to react to violent misconduct - so as a reminder, here's Fergie's pitch-side verdict on a similarly fruity challenge in 1997: Feyenoord's Paul Bosvelt on United's Denis Irwin: 'Come over here, you scumbag, you ratbag, you dirty bastard. Don't swap shirts with those dirty bastards'. 'This is insane. If you are a coach' he added after the game, 'you have to have some principles.' Miss Mexico fancies ITV Shapely pundit Ron Atkinson is on edge after the newly-crowned Miss Mexico, Jacqueline Bracamontes, announced she wants his job. The 21-year-old, who took the title last week, told fans during an online chat that punditry is her 'God-given' destiny. 'I'm just crazy about football' she explained. 'I would love to work as a pundit at the next World Cup. I've had a lot of offers but what I most want to do is commentate.' Along with Ron, she'll be taking part in next month's Miss Universe competition in Puerto Rico, and wants to make her footballing dad proud. ' I might even go out with a footballer. My dream is to be happy' she says. Jacqueline's also chasing 'a cure for aids' and is 'very scared of cockroaches'. Could she be ITV's dream ingredient for next season? Giggsy: don't hurt me Ryan Giggs has revealed he used to hold hands with Paul 'Guvnor' Ince to overcome his two biggest fears in football: flying and Alex Ferguson. 'I used to hate going to games in Europe,' he tells BBC Choice show 45 Minutes on Thursday. 'I remember Paul had a fear of flying too, so we just used to sit next to each other, hold hands and close our eyes.' Timid Ryan also relives his first Hairdryer experience. 'It was when I was 18... I thought that if you'd played 30 or 40 games in the first team, you got a club car. So I decided to ask Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson \"do you think I deserve a club car?\" They said: \"Yeah, you're a regular now_ go talk to the gaffer\". So I went up to the gaffer's office and, as I'm talking to him, his head is getting redder and he's getting angrier. He said \"no club car, no chance. You can have a club bike, but club car? No chance\". That was one of my first experiences of something like that. As I walked out of the door all of the first team lads were outside laughing. They'd all been listening.' 45 minutes, BBC Choice, Thursday 8pm Aki: despair sets in Latest from Aki Rihilaati, Palace's soon-to-be-relegated Finn, writing in his online diary. Things are getting worse. More bad news: my senior pet cat Lineker has past away. He was a good friend and important family member, God bless his soul. This week I recommend: 1. Bella pasta, 2. Ice-cream, 3. Trigger happy TV I do not recommend: 1. Any food with celery, 2. Coca-Cola, 3. Reading more than one book by John Grisham Witch: cough-up or corpse gets it A group of Nigerian players are running a raffle to raise enough cash to pay off a witch doctor holding former skipper Sam Opone's corpse hostage. The witch, Blacky Awommi, halted treatment on former Stationery Stores star Opone when the player ran out of cash - Opone died, and now Awommi won't release the body until his $1,200 debts are cleared. Austin Akosa, a former Nigerian Football Association board member, said Awommi had threatened to use his magic and kill Opone's son Lucky unless the money was paid quickly - hence the squad's rapid collection. 'Yes, we are raising money to pay the witch doctor,' says player Augustine Popo. 'This man has now shown us the mortuary where Opone's corpse is being kept. He's actually very nice.' Hassan twins splatter press 35-year-old world record international appearance holder Hossam Hassan has silenced Egyptian hacks who slammed his performances in February by scoring two cracking goals for club Zamalek against deadly-rivals Al-Ahly. And while the fans rioted in response, Hassan's twin brother Ibrahim picked up a three month suspension and a $3,500 fine by racing over to the press gallery and spitting all over the journalists involved. Quote of the week New Spurs chairman David Buchler: 'We do this club down too much. People forget how highly Glenn Hoddle is regarded in Europe and so is this club. Tottenham is still thought of as one of the biggest clubs in Europe. We are one of the biggest clubs in Europe.' Nurse, the screens.
