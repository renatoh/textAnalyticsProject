Phil Gartside, one of the more influential FA committee members, believes Redknapp would make an \"outstanding England manager\" if he were to leave Tottenham Hotspur to replace Fabio Capello. The Bolton Wanderers chairman went on to describe Redknapp as a \"good motivator with a winning mentality\" in an interview, to be aired on BBC World this weekend, that reinforces the sense that behind the scenes at FA headquarters there is strong support for the Spurs manager to take over from the interim coach, Stuart Pearce, ahead of Euro 2012. Redknapp has decided he will accept the job if, as expected, the four FA executives in charge of the recruitment process \u2013 David Bernstein, Sir Trevor Brooking, Alex Horne and Adrian Bevington \u2013 go through with their plans to approach Spurs about his availability. Although Gartside is not involved in those discussions, the FA board will have to ratify that Redknapp is the right man for the job, as well as rubber-stamping what promises to be a considerable compensation arrangement with Spurs. Gartside's words come at a good time for Redknapp, whose team have badly lost their way since Capello's resignation created the vacancy and made it likely there will have to be a change of manager at White Hart Lane next season. When the FA will make its approach is unclear, with obvious sensitivities surrounding the loss of form at Spurs and not wanting to aggravate the situation, but there is a growing sense that it does not wish to wait much longer. Redknapp is not the only manager under consideration but he has been the overwhelming favourite since the start and his poor run of results will not be held against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
