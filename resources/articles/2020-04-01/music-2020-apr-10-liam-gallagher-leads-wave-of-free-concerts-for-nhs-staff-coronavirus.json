They have had four Top 5 albums since 2014 as a duo, including a No 1 this year with Manchester Calling. Heaton said in a statement: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic should remind everyone, and let no one forget, that our National Health Service is the most brilliant and significant institution in our lives. The men and women who serve us and care for us, give us hope and sacrifice their own wellbeing, can never be thanked enough. We are just musicians, so there is little we can do but sing for you.\u201d Finally, Irish pop-rockers the Script will play a free concert at Dublin\u2019s 3Arena on 9 February for 13,000 British and Irish national health service workers, with the band heralding them as making \u201csacrifices day in and day out, working harder than anyone\u201d.
