The meeting between Mr Blair and the Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, was held hours after the planespotters protested their innocence at a news conference in central London, in which they set out the grounds for their appeal and repeated the claim that they had not been given a fair trial. Mr Simitis arrived at Downing Street shortly after 1pm. He spent around 90 minutes with Mr Blair before emerging to tell reporters that they had discussed topics including EU enlargement, asylum seekers, the Parthenon marbles and the planespotters' trial. Mr Simitis said: \"The case will be decided by a Greek tribunal on November 5. I think there will be a positive development but in our system it is for the courts to decide.\" He refused to elaborate on what he meant by a positive development. Following their convictions last April, the 12 Britons and two Dutchmen all had their sentences suspended pending next Monday's appeal and vowed to clear their names. They have admitted making notes at several Greek air bases but vehemently deny spying, insisting they were innocently pursuing their hobby. The group were arrested at Kalamata air base in southern Greece during a plane spotting trip in November last year, organised by Paul Coppin. They were held for more than six weeks in police cells and prisons before they were eventually released on \u00a39,000 bail each, pending their trial. Euro MP Richard Howitt, who has campaigned for the Britons since their arrest, said that the case was dogged by \"mistake after mistake\" and that the planespotters were \"innocent tourists\" who had suffered a miscarriage of justice. This morning Mr Coppin told reporters of the group's planned appeal. He said they knew that the court could impose tougher sentences of up to five years in jail each, but said they were hoping for their existing sentences to be reduced. They were not confident of getting an acquittal, he said, but would continue to fight to clear their names through the Greek supreme court and the European court of human rights. Graham Arnold, an IT worker from Ottershaw, Surrey, who was sentenced to three years, said: \"It is not just the prison time, it is the effects it would have. \"It would mean having to sell my house, I wouldn't have a job, it would affect the rest of our lives for something that is effectively legal. We had permission to be there.\" The planespotters estimate that their legal costs, court fees and bail money amount to some \u00a325,000 each and said the continuing legal process was causing financial hardship for many of them. Eleven of the 12 British spotters are to return to Kalamata for the appeal. Mick Keane of Dartford, Kent, has been told not to go back on health grounds but the group will take a letter from him and he continues to protest his innocence. Mr Coppin said they had been convicted on the basis that they had written down serial numbers from military aircraft, despite having been given permission from the Greek airforce to visit several bases. The information they gathered had been in the public domain for more than 20 years and therefore could not be considered secret, he said. \"Only an acquittal would be acceptable\", Mr Coppin said. \"Only an acquittal would go some way to restoring an element of credibility in a country thought to be the birthplace of democracy. \"We hope that a miscarriage of justice is not about to be repeated.\" Stephen Jakobi, of the campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said he had been shocked that the judgment in the original trial referred only to the prosecution evidence, and not the defence's case. The six Britons convicted of espionage were Paul Coppin, Peter Norris, Antoni Adamiak, Andrew Jenkins, Graham Arnold and Garry Fagan. The six convicted of aiding and abetting were Mick Keane, Lesley Coppin (Mr Coppin's wife), Michael Bursell, Steve Rush, Christopher Wilson and Wayne Groves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
