Charisma is the rare quality of great leaders in all walks of life says David Weeks, consultant neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, but very difficult to define. \"Charisma could be a whole string of qualities,\" says David. \"For political leaders charisma involves oratory and leadership skills, but it also gets mixed up with sex appeal and celebrity and fame, and it's used very glibly. If someone likes a person very much they are more likely to attribute the term to them,\" he reckons. We like Posh and Becks and Tom and Penelope but do they really have charisma? \"If you look at all the qualities,\" (and he cites empathy, and notoriety among them) \"you get an operational definition of charisma without getting to the heart of it. \"Charismatics have an almost extreme belief in their vision; they have conviction and they wouldn't be easily dissuaded from the main thrust of what they are doing. Often it's the emotional response of one person to another.\" Though David believes charismatics can be powerful and devious - such as Hitler - many, such as Christ and Buddha, fall at the other end of the spectrum. But you don't have to be a religious leader to qualify. David thinks Marlon Brando and Bill Clinton are both charismatics. Unless you were born with charisma, no amount of posing and preening will help you get it. Take our quick quiz to see if charisma is in your DNA: 1. You know you're charismatic because people have likened you to: a) The Dalai Llama/Joan of Arc - because you have a spiritual quality about you and are convinced by your vision. b) Bill Clinton - because the charges against you never stick. c) Gandhi - because you have great dress sense. d) Hitler - because you spit when you speak. 2. People follow you wherever you go because: a) They feel compelled - you have real people power. b) You owe them money. c) You make great spag bol and your fridge is always well stocked. d) You are the human version of fly paper - sticky with a strange smell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
