He then signs a five-year, \u00a35m-a-year contract after guiding Chelsea to their first English title in 50 years. June 2005 Matters turn sour again when Mourinho hears that Frank Arnesen will be appointed chief scout and director of youth development, a role that unofficially extends to advising on first-team recruitment. November 2005 Defeats to Charlton Athletic in the Carling Cup, Real Betis in the Champions League and Manchester United in the Premier League lead to suggestions that Roman Abramovich is interfering in team selection. March 2006 The simmering resentment towards Arnesen erupts with Mourinho banning the Dane from areas of the club's Cobham training centre. May 2006 The arrival of Andriy Shevchenko for \u00a330m from Milan is the realisation of a long-held ambition for Abramovich, who counts the Ukrainian as a personal friend. He expects his record signing to play but with only four Premier League goals to his name in the 2006-07 season Mourinho questions the striker's application and exerts his authority by dropping him and disparaging him in public. January 2007 A summit between board and manager sees Mourinho rail against the injustice of the defensive injury crisis that leaves Chelsea without Petr Cech and John Terry. He demands that the directors release funds for a stopgap signing. Although Tal Ben Haim is available from Bolton, Abramovich balks at the \u00a33m price tag - the Israeli would instead be a Bosman signing in June. The \u00a315m demanded for Micah Richards is another turn-off and deals for Jorge Andrade and Oguchi Onyewu fall through. Summer 2007 For the first time under Abramovich, Chelsea make a net transfer profit in the summer window, with the \u00a324m departure of Arjen Robben outweighing the \u00a313.5m paid for Florent Malouda and the nominal sum for Juliano Belletti. Chelsea's signings are largely fee-free, prompting his bizarre \"omelettes and eggs\" pronouncements before the dull draw against Rosenborg. September 19 2007 A final dispute with Abramovich and talks among executives about the drab fare on offer, the disappointing results and the sub-25,000 crowd that watched Chelsea draw 1-1 at home to Rosenborg prompt Mourinho's departure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
