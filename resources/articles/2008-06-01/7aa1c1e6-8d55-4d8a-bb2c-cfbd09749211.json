Chez Savy, a bistro in Paris's 8th, sometimes puts an uncovered strawberry tart near the door - for me that signifies the style of the food far more than any menu could. 125g plain flour 25g ground almonds 25g caster sugar 50g unsalted butter, softened 1 egg yolk 2 tbsp brandy For the filling 125ml milk 2 tbsp cornflour 1 egg white 50g caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 200ml cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche 400g strawberries Put the flour, almonds and sugar in a bowl, then rub in the butter until incorporated. Beat together the egg yolk and brandy, mix in and stir to a soft dough. Wrap and chill for 30 minutes, then roll out and line a 24cm shallow tart tin. Line with paper and baking beans, and bake at 180C (160C fan-assisted/350F/gas mark 4) for 30 minutes until evenly golden, removing the paper and beans halfway through. Tip the milk, cornflour, egg white, sugar and vanilla into a pan, whisk until smooth, then bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat, spoon into a bowl and cover to stop a skin forming as it cools. When cold, beat in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, then spoon into the pastry case. Destalk the strawberries, cut them in half and fan over the top of the tart, cut side and thick end downward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
