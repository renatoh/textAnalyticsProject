From the day she drew inspiration from Yannick Noah\u2019s win in 1983, as a young girl watching from her home in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, just north of Paris, and all through her serial disappointments in front of her home crowd over 15 years, the French Open represented a prize too far. She got as far as the quarter-finals twice but prospered elsewhere, notably at Wimbledon and in Melbourne, and was No1 in the world for five weeks. Andy Murray, her most enduring client, has two semi-finals to show for eight visits to Paris and, on a roll of 10 clay wins and his first two titles on the dirt this summer, he has never been better placed to go further. Mauresmo insists, however, she is not reliving her past through the world No3. \u201cFor myself, yes, it was frustrating,\u201d she said of the Tour\u2019s second slam of the year. \u201cFor Andy, I hope not. To be honest, that\u2019s what you guys might say. It\u2019s not about me, to be very honest. I would be happy for him to win it; I would be happy for him to win any of the grand slams, basically, so definitely it\u2019s not about me on this one.\u201d Their bond after a little under a year together is strong; imbued with understanding, empathy and trust. That is why it would be a shame if this turned out to be there last big tournament together, given Mauresmo is due to give birth to her first child in August and has reservations about making the trip to London this summer \u2013 or, indeed, to Australia for the Open in January. Murray, however, who opens his campaign here on Monday against the Argentinian lucky loser Facundo Arg\u00fcello, is happy with the way his assistant coach, Jonas Bjorkman, has settled in so quickly \u2013 and Mauresmo agrees the Swede is a perfect fit. \u201cWe spent a couple of days in Barcelona together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re communicating quite a lot, whether it\u2019s texting or calling, so he has an awareness of what has happened until now. Andy is my first experience as a long-term coach, so it has to be also my first experience with another coach brought in, although Dani [Vallverdu] was there last year. It takes time to adjust but so far it\u2019s going pretty well. \u201cThe good thing is that we are both seeing the same things and both have a desire for Andy to improve in the same areas of his game. That\u2019s really key. If you\u2019re going to work together and have different thoughts or different things that you want to prioritise, then it might be a bit difficult. But so far, for a few months now, we\u2019ve talked about Andy and his game \u2013 and I think we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d Monday is unusual in that all five British entrants will play \u2013 so the possibilities for mood swings are obvious. Kyle Edmund fancies his chances against the French qualifier St\u00e9phane Robert \u2013 and would relish a chance to play Murray in the third round, although he would probably have to beat Nick Kyrgios on Wednesday to do so. In the other half of the draw, Aljaz Bedene, registered as British for the first time in a grand slam, has a tough opening match against the talented Austrian Dominic Thiem, although he beat him in a hardcourt Challenger tournament in Texas earlier this year. In the women\u2019s draw, Heather Watson has found some form before her match against the French wildcard Mathilde Johansson, while Johanna Konta, who is in the same quarter, plays the Czech Denisa Allertova."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
