The Brann Stadion is usually described as \"tight\" which, from the looks of things, appears to be another way of saying \"a bit small\". But with 17,000 expected in tonight it should be fairly lively. Brann are actually on their off-season right now and haven't played a game for more than two months, the last two weeks of which have been spent lounging around in La Manga doing something called \"warm weather training\". They are the Norwegian champions, however. And after drawing the Toffees their Director of Sport, Roald Bruun-Hanssen, turned up the heat by telling the club website: \"Everton is not the strongest opposition we could have gotten.\" Apparently they're banking on winning this one and parking the bus in the goalmouth at Goodison. Not only that they can field Eirik Bakke, formerly one of David O'Leary's \"babies\" at Elland road and Scotland international Robbie Winters, formerly best friends with Dusty Bin on 5-4-3-2-1. Everton, for their part, have a 100% record in Europe this season. They're missing Mikel Arteta and Steven Pienaar, but Yakubu is back on the scene - and \u00a380,000 worse off - after his bout of wanderlust following the African Cup of Nations. Wonder if he'll run across and hug David Moyes if he scores tonight? \"Some people might try and make the Uefa Cup out to be dreary, but that's nonsense,\" Phil Neville said this week. And he should know. Will the Toffees find Brann hard to stomach? Or will they show some fibre in Norway? And what other horrible Brann/bran references remain to be shoehorned into tonight's live coverage? It's all coming up. Our teams tonight: SK Brann: Opdal, Dahl, Bjarnason, Sigurdsson, Hanstveit, Solli, Bakke, El Fakiri, Moen, Helstad, Bjornsson. Subs: Udjus, Guntveit, Thwaite, Misje, Huseklepp, Demba-Nyren, Winters. Everton: Howard, Neville, Yobo, Jagielka, Lescott, Osman, Cahill, Carsley, Fernandes, Yakubu, Johnson. Subs: Wessels, Hibbert, Baines, Van der Meyde, Vaughan, Anichebe, Rodwell. Referee: Anton Genov (Bulgaria) So the Yak starts in Bergen. Rob Rayburn wants to know: \"Any chance of someone yelling, \"Gordie Brown, are you listening? You're boys took one hell of a beating!\" tonight?\" Possibly just you, Rob. But you never know. 1 min: They're off! Everton's two baldies, Carsley and Johnson kick off. No sponsors' logo on Everton's shirts tonight. Perhaps Chang means something rude in Norwegian. 1 min: Chance for Yakubu, running on to Neville's long ball. His shot is saved by the keeper. Decent chance that. Had a bit more time than he thought. 3 min: Brann do look a bit rusty. Everton have plenty of time on the ball right now. Another chance, this time for Johnson and easily saved again. 5 min: Apparently you can't have booze sponsors on your shirt in Norway. 7 min: It's a bit like a practice match out there. Plenty of time and space. Everton just put ten passes together. Ended with Lescott hoofing it into the keeper's hands. 9 min: First attack for Brann. Free kick just outside the box. Solli swings it in and Karadas heads it over when he might have scored. Dangerous moment that. 11 min: The crowd are booing Lee Carsley for some reason. Seems a bit unnecessary. 13 min: Everton free kick swung into the box from the left hand side. Punched away by the keeper. This is all a bit of a stroll at the moment. 15 min: Brann free kick this time. Moen puts it into the box. Carsley nuts it away. 16 min: It's really quiet in the stadium. Where's the Brann roar? 18 min: Quite a surreal moment there as the ball was punted in towards Helstad in the six yard box. He trapped it on his thigh sandwiched in between Jagielka and Yobo but couldn't do anything with it. Eventually it flopped on to the floor and was hacked away. 21 min: All still in slow motion. Good news for Everton fans: it's quite boring. Andy Johnson has been flagged offside twice in a minute. And yes, he's looking a cereal threat to the Brann defence. 23 min: Decent Brann break after about ten minutes of defending. Helstad easily foiled by a neat tackle from Jagielka inside his own box. 25 min: First corner for the home team. Could have been worse with the ball bouncing around in the Everton box. 26 min: Howard punches unconvincingly and Everton clear. They need to get a grip here. Brann are there for the taking, but Everton seem to have gone into their shells a bit. 29 min: Corner for Everton. Yakubu does brilliantly to play Neville in by the touchline. Deflected behind. 30 min: Carsley hoofs one over from 30 yards from the corner. The Yak looks in the mood tonight. Not sure the Brann defence really fancy him either. Get it forward. 32 min: Yak almost slips Johnson though inside the six yard box. He lays it back to Osman, whose shot is palmed away by the keeper. Well, that all looked really easy. More of the same required. Pretty decent save in the end. 34 min: Loads of possession for Everton down the right. You've got to wonder what Arteta might have made of it. Neville isn't exactly bombing forward like Garrincha at the moment. 37 min: Decent spell of attacking possession for Brann, but they're fairly ponderous. This does look like a team who haven't played for two months. Good night to get after an away goal ... oops Yakubu latches on to a long pass and blasts one over the bar. 39 min: Solli, in turn, hoofs one over the Everton bar from 30 yards. 42 min: Howard leaps to claim a deep cross from the left wing. This is poor stuff indeed. Does anyone know any good jokes? 45 min: Close call for Everton. Brann corner swung in, the ball ends up in the back of the net at the near post, but the ref says Bakke was fouling Howard. Bit of an arm raised I suppose. David Moyes looks cross. 45+1 min: And that's half time. Well, not much happened until the final 30 seconds. That was a clear foul by Bakke so I'm not sure why he's arguing his case with the ref as everybody slopes off for half an orange and a rub down. Everton will be happy with this, but you've got to think they should score against this team. Incidentally, Kjell Olav Thornes says that Brann means \"fire\" in Norwegian. He appears to be suggesting the club was originally supposed to be called Fart, which means \"velocity\". SK Fart . Much, much better. Oyvind Bech says that residents of Bergen are well known for pronouncing their r's with a throat-ripping \"rrrrrr\" sound. Apparently this is very irritating to other Norwegians. How long before Rrrrrrobbie Winterrrrs comes off the bench, they'll be asking themselves. 46 min: Fart kick off. Sorry, Brann. 47 min: Lescott barges his way down the left wing and almost forces a corner. Everton look like they might try to play a bit quicker this half. 49 min: Everton corner. Then another. Fernandes takes it but the keeper comes and takes the ball. Poor set piece but Everton look up for it so far this half. 50 min: John Fong asks: \"Could the Norwegians have mistaken Carsley for Tommy Gravesen hence the booing?\" Maybe so. 52 min: The crowd only seem to come to life when they think their team should have a free kick. Well, not much else for them to cheer tonight to be honest. Everton will be kicking themselves if they don't win this. 53 min: CAHILL HITS THE POST. The inside of it, with a left-footer from 25 yards. Actually a brilliant finger-tip save from the keeper. Very close. 55 min: Dahl wins a corner for Brann, which is wasted. Brilliant defending from Jagielka before that to defend Dahl's cross. 57 min: Brann beginning to get things moving. Another corner for the home team. Walloped away by Carsley. Everton keep the ball for a bit. 59 min: GOAL FOR EVERTON!!! Brilliant right foot strike by Osman from 25 yards. Brann cleared the ball from a Johnson cross, but only as far as Osman. He bent that in first time with the outside of his right foot. Fantastic technique. And just after Moyes had moved him over to the right too. 62 min: More nifty work from Jagielka under pressure in his own box. He's having a very good game. 64 min: Gary Naylor (for it is he) points out: \"Everton had six men attacking for that goal - damned good stuff away from home.\" All a bit more up tempo now. Johnson almost gets a shot away inside the box. He's been busy this half. 66 min:Solli has a shot from 30 yards, easily gathered by Howard. Solli has been Brann's most lively player by a distance. Maybe he fancies a move to Portsmouth/Bolton 68 min: Brann are trying to step it up a bit, but they're looking a bit laboured to be honest. I fancy Everton to get another from here. 69 min: Manuel Fernandes is booked for a late tackle. And comes on for Karadas. 71 min: Wahey! Loads of tackles flying in near the Everton area. The ref lets it go. Carsley to the fore there. Booo! 72 min: The pitch is really heavy now. Looks like Anichebe is coming on soon. 75 min: Brann bring on Huseklepp for El-Fakiri. Apparently he's a \"super sub\". Let's see. Brann have had a lot of the ball the last few minutes. But they've done nothing with it. Anichebe comes on for Johnson. He really is a big strong lad. 77 min: Great bouncing shot from Fernandes, great save by the keeper. Almost nodded in from the resulting corner but Brann clear very well. 80 min: Knut Nordheim reminds us that there is in fact already a team in Norway called Fart FC, Thorstein Helstad's first club. I wonder what the Fart/Brann head to head looks like? 81 min: Super sub Huseklepp looks lively down the left, but can't seem to get his delivery right. 83 min: Tim Howard makes a great save from Demba. Then from the corner he gathers the ball right on the line form a close range header. Brann's most threatening moment of the half. Some claims that the ball might have been over the line. But it wasn't. 85 min: Really good spell for Brann. Another good cross from the right but Everton defend well. 87 min: Everton keep the ball for a bit. Nice shirt passing. They need it too. David Moyes is up pointing at people. 88 min: GOAL FOR EVERTON !!! It's Anichebe with a close-range finish from a great diagonal pass by Lescott. 90 min: He was a bit offside to tell the truth. But a very nice goal all the same. That's the tie, you'd think. Hibbert on for Fernandes. 90+1 min: Everton are cruising now towards their sixth successive win in Europe - a club record. Brann have been a bit disappointing to be honest. Yakubu's off with a big grin on his face and Baines is on. Full time And that's it. In the end an easier night than Everton might have expected and a really good result. It even livened up a bit towards the end. Jagielka played particularly well for the visitors, as did the penitent Yak in the first half. David Moyes will be glowering with pleasure after that. That's all from me folks. Hope you enjoyed the commentary. Thanks for all your emails and apologies to those I couldn't read out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
