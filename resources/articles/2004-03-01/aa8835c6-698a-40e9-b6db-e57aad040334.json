The United midfielder was shown a straight red card for stamping on goalkeeper Vitor Baia's back and Uefa today opted for just a one-match suspension, despite his victim's suggestion he should be harshly punished. Quoted in today's Daily Star, Baia had urged Uefa to throw the book at Keane for his actions. \"Roy Keane is a bad example for the game of football,\" he said. \"I will be glad if Uefa punish him with the greatest possible number of matches.\" United lost 2-1 in Portugal but will have to overturn that deficit at Old Trafford next week without Keane, whose ban comes into force immediately. \"I am pleased common sense has prevailed,\" said Keane. \"There was no malice in the incident and I think UEFA have recognised that.\" United boss Sir Alex Ferguson dismissed the incident, which sparked a furious touchline argument with opposite number Jose Mourinho last week, as trivial. However, of more concern to Ferguson will be the guarded but positive reaction Republic of Ireland coach Brian Kerr has given to Keane's recent revelation that he would be willing to consider coming out of international retirement in time for the World Cup qualifying campaign that starts next autumn. Keane has not played for his country since dramatically walking out of their World Cup training camp in Japan nearly two years ago but he has already been talked out of one return after initially indicating to Kerr that he would turn out for his country again. A fortnight ago, the 32-year-old again claimed to have 'unfinished business' with Ireland and while Kerr was shrewd enough not to raise his hopes too much, he accepted a recall was possible provided the United skipper conformed to his rules. \"If Roy wants to make himself available in the future, I have no problems with that. But ultimately, I'll be in charge,\" Kerr told Dublin's Evening Herald. \"The team will be run my way. Anyone who comes into the panel will be treated exactly the same as the rest of the squad. Every player has to be committed and has to live within the rules of the team. Everybody knows how to get in touch with me if they want to come back. But anyone who wants to return has to know it's right for them. \"There is no point if a player who has retired from international football says he wants to play for us again, only to find out that his club manager does not agree.\" Meanwhile team-mate Paul Scholes has requested a personal hearing into the charge of violent conduct levelled against him by the FA for a clash with Middlesbrough's Doriva on February 11. Referee Paul Durkin indicated in his match report that he had not seen the incident, but it was picked up on television replays and the FA decided to act. Manchester United notified the FA of Scholes' intention to challenge the charge this afternoon, and the FA will now set a suitable date for his hearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
