Paul will make his first appearance of the season for the Bulls at Huddersfield and only his second since he suffered a triple fracture of an arm in a game against St Helens last June. The New Zealander returned as a substitute in Bradford's Grand Final victory over Wigan at Old Trafford in October but the arm had not fully healed and, when a second bone graft failed to take, there were fears for the 28-year-old's career. He missed the World Club Championship win against Penrith last month but returned to training two weeks ago and will definitely play against the Giants tomorrow afternoon - although with Mick Withers, Logan Swann, Shontayne Hape, Karl Pratt and Toa Kohe-Love all out injured, Bradford's coach Brian Noble was in no position to finalise the team yesterday. Huddersfield, who like Bradford have won their first two Super League matches, are preparing for their first five-figure crowd at the McAlpine Stadium since they faced the Bulls in their first match after winning promotion in 1998. Brandon Costin, the Australian stand-off who rejoined them from Bradford last season, will have a late fitness test on the knee injury which has kept him out for the last three weeks. Warrington have reduced the capacity at their new Halliwell-Jones Stadium to around 13,000 for the visit of Castleford after the problems at the previous Super League match there against Wakefield four weeks ago, when hundreds of season-ticket holders were locked out in chaotic scenes. But there will not be many travelling supporters to cope with after Castleford slumped to a 26-0 defeat in the Challenge Cup at Hull last Sunday, thereby raising questions about Steadman's future at the Jungle. His contract is up at the end of the season and, despite the vote of confidence he received after a board meeting on Monday, the former Great Britain full-back needs the Tigers to show a considerable improvement at Warrington. He has promoted two teenagers from the club's academy team, Craig Huby and Dean Ripley, to a 20-man squad, with Waine Pryce returning on the wing after groin surgery but late fitness tests for Nathan Sykes and Ryan Sheridan. Warrington are definitely without two of their overseas players - the Australian prop Chris Leikvoll, who will be out for four to six weeks with a calf problem, and Graham Appo who has a torn hamstring. In tomorrow's other Super League game Hull's Wales prop Garreth Carvell will return against the struggling London Broncos at the KC Stadium after recovering from flu. Tonight's televised fixture presents promoted Salford with the chance to record a second consecutive home win against Wakefield. \u00b7 The Rugby Football League confirmed yesterday that Cardiff's Millennium Stadium will stage the Powergen Challenge Cup final for the third year running in 2005, with the final put back to August 27, the Saturday of the Bank Holiday weekend, as part of the new agreement with the BBC."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
