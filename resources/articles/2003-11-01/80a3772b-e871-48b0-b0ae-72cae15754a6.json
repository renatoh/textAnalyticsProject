Ellison, the Guardian's former home news editor, joined the Independent in June as part of an editorial shake-up. He declined to comment on his decision other than to confirm he was leaving. \"I will be spending more time with my toy car collection,\" he quipped. He handed in his resignation on Monday and is working out his notice. Ellison, who held a number of senior positions at the Guardian, including arts correspondent and New York correspondent, was one of the Independent's most experienced executives and added valuable clout on news. However, some say that, like some of his predecessors on the Independent newsdesk, he suffered because \"he wasn't listened to\". Ellison replaced Adam Leigh, who moved to take over responsibility for the Independent's Review section as executive editor (features), and reported to executive editor (news) John Mullin, a former Guardian night editor. \"I'm absolutely thrilled to get a guy of Mike's experience and ability in such a key role on the paper,\" said the Independent editor, Simon Kelner, when Ellison's appointment was announced in June. The Independent boosted its circulation by 7.5% year on year in October thanks to the launch of a tabloid edition in the Carlton, Granada and Meridian TV regions. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
