When police leaked the view that JonBen\u00e9t had been killed by her parents who were likely to escape justice because they had expensive lawyers, US news coverage became almost hysterical. Seven and a half years on, the unsolved case remains the most widely reported child murder ever. Yet despite this, tomorrow an ITV documentary will reveal developments that the US media failed to report. Even more surprising, Who Killed the Pageant Queen? The Prime Suspect will be the third British documentary to have done so. It reveals many new details about the murder and exposes - more clearly than ever - failings in the investigative and judicial process. Many Americans, if they ever get to see the documentary, will ask \"why haven't we been told this?\" It is an important question. We first glimpsed how important when we tried to sell our first documentary to CBS. This showed that it was easy to disprove every specific allegation made against the parents in the US media. Yet we discovered that Dan Rather, CBS's legendary news anchor, was arguing against the network running features on the killing. This surprised us. Given Rather's reputation - after all, he had complained that the US news media had become \"lap dogs, not watch dogs\" - we thought it was the sort of story he would have welcomed. Perhaps he knew it was a story no US network could cover properly. The pressures on television news departments are so great that we think he feared that even CBS's coverage would end up looking tabloid and tacky. But how could this be the case in a country which prides itself on free speech and the quality of its journalism? In part, at least, it stems from the very different role law enforcement and the judicial process play in the popular imagination of Americans, compared with Europeans. In the US it is seen as less about justice and more about forcing compliance: that is, protecting decent people from the tide of violent crime they fear is always about to engulf them. Most Americans see the need to protect society as so overwhelming that a measure of injustice in achieving this is an acceptable price. As one American producer put it to me, no US journalist will get excited by the injustice done to JonBen\u00e9t's parents because it is just a drop in the ocean. As a result there is little tradition in US broadcasting of programmes such as World in Action or Rough Justice, which seek out and expose injustices. Trying to develop one would face a lack of interest and even hostility. As market forces have increasingly dominated US journalism and broadcasting, the ability, let alone the will, to fund investigations - always expensive and rarely popular - has all but disappeared. Once US network's news departments were ring-fenced from such pressures and were not expected to make profits. This is no longer the case. Now they have to generate cash for shareholders like any other part of the business. This means they must make news entertaining and profitable. We came up against this when we sold our second documentary on JonBen\u00e9t to a US cable network. The programme argued that a key part of the case against the parents was untrue because they could not have killed their daughter in the way police alleged. A crucial part of the evidence lay in grim photographs taken at JonBen\u00e9t's autopsy. These images could be softened but not eliminated, yet the network wanted to cut them as they feared advertisers would object, on taste grounds. Fortunately we managed to dissuade them. There were no complaints from viewers - indeed the reverse. Research carried out by my colleague and co-producer Professor Michael Tracey, director of Colorado University's Centre for Mass Media Research, shows that US viewers asked why they had not been told these things before. It is another reminder of how fragile the mechanisms are that promote good broadcasting and journalism. You do not even have to go to the US to see this. This Week, World in Action and Rough Justice have gone: none of them needed in the dynamic broadcasting market this government, like the last, has done so much to promote. Our documentary is not the sort of programme they make any longer in the US. so the fact that in Britain ITV has decided to put it out in peak time is revealing and encouraging. Hopefully it shows where TV journalism needs to go, not simply where it has come from. Going there, though, will take courage: and on the US evidence - as Tracey has argued - it will require new institutional arrangements that give commercial broadcasters a financial incentive to make demanding programmes. On present evidence it does not seem likely. Market pressures on British broadcasters are growing not abating. Despite the efforts of ITV executives like Steve Anderson, who commissioned our documentary, it seems all too probable that Britain will follow the US and find that important stories that viewers want to hear are no longer being told. \u00b7 David Mills co-produced Who Killed the Pageant Queen?
