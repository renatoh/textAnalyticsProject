Kenneth Macharia, whose plight prompted more than 100,000 people to sign a petition calling on the Home Office to halt his removal, has been told he must now leave the country \u201cwithout delay\u201d. The 39-year-old \u2013 who plays for Bristol Bisons, a gay and inclusive rugby club \u2013 says he is \u201cfeeling depressed\u201d at the decision, which came as a big surprise, adding: \u201cI am feeling hopeless at the moment.\u201d A Home Office decision letter sent to Macharia\u2019s solicitor acknowledged that gay sex in Kenya was punishable by up to 21 years in prison and that LGBT people have reportedly been subjected to harassment, blackmail and rape. However, the letter added: \u201cWhilst same-sexual activity between men has been criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison this law is rarely applied and the objective evidence does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subjected to persecution or serious harm.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s decision comes days after Kenya\u2019s high court last month upheld laws that criminalise gay sex in what was described by a campaigner as a \u201ca sad day for the rule of law and human rights\u201d. Macharia, who first claimed asylum in May 2016, arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2009. Macharia, a mechanical design engineer, has twice been granted extensions of his leave to remain, as a student and then as a highly skilled migrant. He has been through a legal appeals process, which has dragged on for several years. His initial claim for asylum was rejected in October 2016; so too was an appeal against the decision in December that year. After being granted permission to appeal to the upper tier, it was dismissed in August 2017. He was twice refused the right to appeal to the court of appeal in October 2017 and June 2018. Further submissions were refused in September and October 2018. Macharia, from Glastonbury, lodged new submissions in November and December which were the subject of the Home Office\u2019s latest decision. A judge previously accepted that Macharia is gay but dismissed his claim that he would suffer persecution in Kenya. In its latest letter, the Home Office rejected Macharia\u2019s concerns that he would be targeted because he was a \u201chigh-profile homosexual man\u201d based on a string of news stories in the Kenyan press about his case, some of which prompted homophobic comments. Facebook comments seen by the Guardian underneath a Kenyan news article about Macharia in November describe him as a \u201cvery bad example to the society in Kenya\u201d. Another states: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more demons here.\u201d The Home Office letter said: \u201cNo evidence has been submitted to show that you will be singled out and persecuted by the authorities in Kenya as a result of your case being reported in the media.\u201d The letter noted that homophobic comments were \u201cvery distasteful\u201d but there were no direct threats to Macharia. In its decision, the Home Office also cited its own March 2017 document on \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d in Kenya, which noted that although \u201csame-sex sexual activity between men is criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison \u2026 it is not clear if there have been any convictions\u201d. It added: \u201cSources suggest that the law on \u2018unnatural offences\u2019 is rarely applied and there have only been two recent reported cases of its use, one of which was dismissed and the other still ongoing at the time of publication.\u201d The Home Office document conceded that the police have arrested \u201csome LGBT persons\u201d but added: \u201cThis is usually followed by their release shortly afterwards.\u201d The document also acknowledged: \u201cThe police have also reportedly harassed LGBT persons, or those believed to be so, and have subjected some to blackmail and rape. Public order laws have been used by the police as a means to arrest LGBT persons, especially those working in the sex industry.\u201d But it added: \u201cThere have, however, also been some occasions where the police have protected LGBT persons against mob attack. In general the evidence available does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subject to persecution or serious harm by the state.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s decision letter concluded: \u201cTaking the above objective evidence into full consideration alongside the reports enclosed, there is no evidence to support your claim that homosexual\u2019s [sic] in Kenya suffer persecution by either the state or non-state actors. \u201cIt is also noted from the above objective evidence that effective state protection is likely to be available which you could access should you fear reprisals from mob justice or other people.\u201d The document added that \u201cthere is nothing to show that you would be persecuted by the state as a result of your sexual orientation as a homosexual\u201d. A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThis government has a proud record of providing protection for asylum seekers fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \u201cAll available evidence is carefully and sensitively considered in light of published country information. All decisions on claims based on sexual orientation are subject to an additional safeguard reviewed by a second experienced caseworker.\u201d Macharia said he would consult his lawyer about his next steps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
