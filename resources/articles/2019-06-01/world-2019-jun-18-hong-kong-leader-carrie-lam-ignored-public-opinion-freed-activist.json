The 22-year-old, who was the face of the last major demonstrations in Hong Kong in 2014, was released from jail on Monday following a two-month term for contempt of court. He said that despite Lam\u2019s \u201csincere and solemn\u201d apology at a press conference, and her hint that the extradition law that sparked this month\u2019s mass protests had been effectively retracted, the chief executive had not met any of her critics\u2019 demands. \u201cFor the 2 million-strong protest, all she said was sorry, but she has completely ignored public opinion,\u201d Wong told the Guardian. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t even make a promise that she won\u2019t revive the bill within her tenure.\u201d Lam promised only that she would not revive the extradition law \u2013 which would allow Hong Kongers to be extradited to a Chinese justice system where the conviction rate is often as high as 99% \u2013 before it expires in July next year, and she refused to step down before her term ends in 2022. Protesters are demanding she fully withdraw the extradition law and account for police brutality during the demonstrations, in which riot officers used rubber bullets and tear gas. They also want her to release those arrested, refrain from calling last week\u2019s protest a riot, and resign. Messages on social media indicate that unless these demands are addressed before 5pm on Thursday, demonstrators will rally in front of the government headquarters the following day. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the G20 meeting, she is essentially mobilising people to take to the streets and embarrassing [the Chinese president] Xi Jinping,\u201d said Wong. The 2019 G20 summit of the world\u2019s leading economies will be held in Japan on 28 and 29 June. Wong acknowledged, however, that, in a semi-autonomous city where there are civil freedoms but no democracy, forcing the government to indefinitely suspend the bill was \u201ca symbolic achievement even if not a complete victory\u201d. The poor living conditions in Hong Kong\u2019s prisons, such as being allowed to change uniform only once every four days despite having no air conditioning in sub-tropical heat, did not seem to have dented Wong\u2019s determination. The secretary general of the Demosist\u014d party said he regretted missing out on the mass protests of the past 10 days and was looking forward to joining any further actions. Despite his youth, Wong is a seasoned activist. At 15, he became the face of a campaign which in 2012 forced the authorities to shelve a plan to introduce \u201cnational education\u201d to Hong Kong schools. He was one of the leaders of the 2014 \u201cumbrella movement\u201d, which began when he was just about to turn 18. Asked whether he would like to be the leader of the next set of protests, Wong sidestepped. He said: \u201cAs an organic movement, the anti-extradition protest is very decentralised. The key is not who is leading it.\u201d Many learned about the protests through messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, or via social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. \u201cWhen a movement has no leaders, it constitutes even greater pressure on the authorities to give concessions because they have no one to negotiate with and they can\u2019t just go and arrest one of the leaders,\u201d he said. The opposition to the extradition bill came from not only the pro-democracy camp and young people, but also the business sector. The huge turnout for the protests \u2013 an estimated 1 million on 9 June and nearly 2 million on 16 June, were beyond anyone\u2019s imagination, Wong said. \u201cThe price they are paying for turning Hong Kong into a war zone is that they get to find out that the people\u2019s reaction can be so strong,\u201d Wong said. He said Hong Kong people had been fighting to retain their freedoms since they came under Chinese rule in 1997 \u2013 from the opposition to a subversion law in 2003 which prompted500,000 to march, to the recent demonstrations. Each time, the fighting spirit grew stronger, he said. \u201cThey have already radicalised a whole generation of young people,\u201d Wong said. But even under the \u201cone country two systems\u201d policy \u2013 which China pledged to stick to for 50 years after Britain handed over its former colony \u2013 Hong Kong has limited room to manoeuvre politically and the ultimate goal of democracy seems remote. Asked whether he could face the same fate as the Chinese student leaders who went into exile after the crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement 30 years ago, Wong said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to end up like them; that\u2019s why we are doing what we are doing now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
