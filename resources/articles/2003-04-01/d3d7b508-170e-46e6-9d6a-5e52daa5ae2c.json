Google eases my insatiable curiosity about everything. I admire brands that demonstrate original interactivity like Nesquik.co.uk - it's a bit of a tired old brand but their site is doing new things and there are lots of things for kids to play and do. Last online purchase? Flights to Venice with Ryanair and the new White Stripes CD from Amazon. I love that choppy guitar thang. Ever been in a chat room? Yes, but it wasn't very amusing, so I left. It was a tennis enthusiasts' site, lots of very detailed conversations. I think chat rooms are OK if you are fascinated by a particular subject. Most recent technological faux pas? I am ashamed of my mobile since it has too many functions - some in colour. I have worked out how to make the blue light flash. Main news source on the web? I get email alerts from a vast range of professional and unprofessional sources. For work I mainly use Brand Republic and Retail Week, which I imagine is technical and boring for most people. Factiva is a good press alert. Most useful website? Google definitely - I like to type in words at random to see what comes up. Other sites haven't been thought of yet - there's lots yet to happen. Least useful website? All websites deserve five seconds of fame. Airlinemeals.net shows you pictures of airline meals and there was one called cat-scan.com with pictures of people's cats. Fantastically original, but less than useful. Do you use a screensaver? No. I am more of a PC desktop background person. I have a blank blue screen at work, and Tom and Jerry are on the kitchen computer. Most irritating thing about the internet? Nothing irritates me about the internet. I work in it you see. What type of online business is least likely to succeed? I don't know about least likely, but I believe in three rules for success - provide something people actually want, manage cash flow effectively and keep enough working capital to do what you want. The rest is up to your own creativity and imagination. Do you still bother with old media? I follow the Guardian, the FT for business news and Private Eye for their consistently clever comment and cartoons. I am astounded by the intelligence and wit of children's TV shows - my sons watch Sponge Bob Square Pants which is stupid but amazingly inventive. \u00b7 Alastair Duncan is MD of Zentropy Partners, an interactive marketing agency"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
