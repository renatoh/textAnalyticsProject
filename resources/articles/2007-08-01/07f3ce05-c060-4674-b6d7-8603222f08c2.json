Far from the homogenised Europe controlled by the Brussels bureaucracy so beloved by our Eurosceptic pols and hacks, most will see a wide variety of nations, regions and communities that have managed to share a small part of their common sovereignty to form this thing called the European Union. Ever since Britain joined in 1973, the question of Europe has plagued British politics. The 1975 referendum solved nothing. The virus of anti-Europeanism distorts all rational discussion on the relationship between Britain and the other nations of Europe. Labour was badly infected in the Seventies and Eighties, with party stalwarts such as Tony Benn and Robin Cook hitting out at Europe. Labour's 1987 manifesto had more on Polisario than on Europe. Today, Labour has its anti-Europeanism under control, even if pro-Europeanism is far from encouraged. It has been the Tories who have embraced hostility to the EU as an ideology that can unite most Conservative MPs. Now David Cameron has staked all on trying to raise Europe as the defining issue in his contest with Gordon Brown. The new Prime Minister has spurned the plebiscite populism of Tony Blair and said that Parliament should be the focus of decision-making on Britain's international treaty relationships with Europe. Cameron is hoping to defeat Brown by forging an anti-Brown coalition of Tory, Lib Dem and Eurosceptic Labour MPs to force through a referendum on the new EU treaty and defeat Brown's insistence on the primacy of Parliament. So is Brown's pledge to listen to the people best dealt with through a populist referendum on the EU treaty? We should be happier that he is poised to restore authority to the Commons. Brown appears to take Edmund Burke's view that Parliament exists to settle the international policy of the nation. If listening to the people equals referendums, why not one on immigration or prison sentences? In the end, the question of the referendum will be settled in Parliament. If Hague and Cameron can persuade enough MPs to vote for a referendum, then one will be held, but have no doubt - their main motive remains getting Gordon. The Tories are hoping that a 'no' vote in a referendum will plunge Britain into a crisis in terms of relations with other nations in Europe and show that Brown is unable to maintain authority over his MPs in the Commons. But to achieve this, Cameron has again to make the Tories the party obsessed with Europe. He has to allow his viscerally anti-European colleague William Hague full rein in opposing Europe. Hague has already affected a rupture between the Conservatives and the ruling centre-right parties in Europe. To the dismay of Washington, which wants an Atlanticist Brown to heal the divisions over Iraq and rebuild with Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy a 21st-century EU-US partnership, the Tories are more and more strident in their opposition to Europe. And like Labour Eurosceptics in the Eighties, Hague has to take extensive liberties with the facts in his hostility to Europe. When the constitutional treaty was defeated by the French and Dutch 'no' votes in 2005, the then shadow foreign secretary, Liam Fox, told the Commons that, as a qualified doctor, he could recognise death when he saw it and the constitution was now dead. Dr Fox was right, but David Cameron has to pretend that the new treaty is just a Lazarus-like constitution brought to life. Yet the new treaty is a quarter of the length of the dead constitution. It is another in the series of treaties that have altered the rule book on Europe ever since 1957. The old treaties stay in place, except where they are amended by the new treaty. Digby Jones, the former CBI chief and now a minister, was a critic of the constitution, but he welcomed the new treaty when talking to a Commons select committee last month. As he should. When the idea of a president of the European Council of Nations, to stand alongside the presidents of the European Commission and the European Parliament, was first proposed by Britain and France, it was bitterly attacked by the Brussels establishment. EU commissioners were wheeled out to explain why a stronger voice for the nations of Europe expressed by a full-time president of the European Council would clog up the smooth decision-making of the Commission. Yet far from welcoming this new post, which is the first significant return of power to the nation states of the EU since the Treaty of Rome, the Tories are denouncing this development as meaning the end of British sovereignty. So far this summer, we have seen Nicolas Sarkozy cutting private deals with Colonel Gadaffi and Gordon Brown deciding new policy on Iraq. In short, the sovereign states of Europe continue to take independent decisions on foreign policy in the light of their interests and political culture. Hague insists that the new treaty means the end of British control over foreign policy. Even the most nationalistic of French Eurosceptics dare not speak such nonsense in Paris, where the complaint is that the EU is going too far, too fast in an Anglo-Saxon direction of liberal market economics. There are 27 foreign policies in the EU. By dint of hard work, it is possible to bring together the pro-American Poles, the neutralist Irish, the Gaullist French and the Mediterranean-obsessed Spanish, as well as the cautious Germans and know-all Brits, into agreeing some common foreign policy positions. As one of Europe's leading actors, Britain has huge influence in shaping common EU foreign policy lines for good or ill. Conservative Foreign Secretaries in the Nineties prevented Europe from taking common action to stop the genocidal politics of Srebrenica or Rwanda. Conversely, all the efforts of Tony Blair and Jack Straw could not persuade key EU nations to support the invasion of Iraq. So David Cameron's line that the new treaty means Brussels dictating foreign policy to Britain is nonsense on stilts. Are they in touch with the British public? The combined readership of the out-and-out Eurosceptic press amounts to nearly 20 million. But despite the best efforts of Hague, the number of readers willing to sign a petition to support the Tory call for a referendum does not come to 1 per cent of those millions of readers. Is this a sign that, finally, we are seeing a very British common-sense line on the EU? It is here to stay. It is better to make it work rather than rant and rail against it. Labour came to that understanding 15 years ago when a new generation, headed by Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, realised that Euroscepticism was dead-end politics. How long before the Conservatives make the same choice? \u00b7 Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham and was Labour's longest-serving Europe Minister \u00b7 Andrew Rawnsley is away"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
