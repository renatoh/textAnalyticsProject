Nokia hopes to consign that stereotype to history with the introduction of the compact 6233, a cut-down version of a 3G phone. It doesn't include person-to-person video calling, for example. It might be small but Nokia has crammed in quite a few features. There's a two megapixel camera, capable of fantastic video, a web browser and an MP3 player. However, the camera is on the front of the phone, which makes it tricky to frame pictures; the web browser is slow; and the MP3 is compromised by the speakers. It also doesn't come with a USB connector. Nevertheless, the phone has faultless call quality, easy-to-use buttons and a battery life of up to four hours' talk time. Overall, it is a solid budget 3G phone. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
