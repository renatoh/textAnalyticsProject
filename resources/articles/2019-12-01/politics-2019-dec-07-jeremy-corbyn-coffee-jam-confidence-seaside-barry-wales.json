A dozen hardcore supporters wait outside in the cold for the prospect of a chat or a selfie. Unable to get in, one woman asks a harried local party member, incongruously dressed in a suit and a Santa hat, if he\u2019ll pass on a gift \u201cfor Jeremy \u2013 please\u201d. Whooping breaks out inside as Corbyn enters the room to what is now his public soundtrack, several giddy choruses of \u201cOoohh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d, as one man yells: \u201cYou\u2019re a legend!\u201d Richard, a retired local architect, stands in the road and sticks two fingers up at the Labour leader as the coach passes him. \u201cIt feels good to do that to him,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m giving him the finger because I don\u2019t like the chap. To me, he\u2019s a throwback to Michael Foot and Tony Benn. He\u2019s a dinosaur.\u201d Richard, who declines to give his surname, says he usually votes Conservative but was unsure what to do now as his local MP, Alun Cairns, had \u201cgot himself in a bit of a mess and shot himself in the foot\u201d. Cairns resigned as Welsh secretary last month following a row over how much he knew and when about his former aide\u2019s role in the alleged sabotage of a rape trial. Despite a palpable loss of support, Cairns is standing once again to represent the Vale of Glamorgan, a seat he held under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. But Labour senses an opportunity, and so there is little surprise to find Corbyn on the final Saturday before election day in a zero-waste coffee shop in Barry, where he swaps a jar of blackberry and apple jam from his allotment for Dragon\u2019s Breath jam from Penylan Preservesin Cardiff and has a stab at making a cappuccino. National concerns are ever present: Corbyn, for instance, is asked about the source of documents he brandished earlier in the campaign, which the website Reddit said on Friday night were linked to a Russian interference campaign. Corbyn declined to disclose the source of the papers, which he had argued showed that the US was seeking \u201ctotal market access\u201d after the UK left the EU and therefore undermined Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. There is no suggestion the papers were fake. \u201cWe obtained those documents,\u201d the Labour leader insists in Barry. \u201cWe believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else.\u201d Over at the social club, supporters were given a rallying call that ran through the injustices bestowed by the Tories, hammering home statistics on poverty, homelessness and deepening inequality. For people like Christine Linley, a lifelong socialist and retired special needs worker, his message is compelling. About Cairns, she is scathing: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything for Barry.\u201d Linley has lived in the town for 16 years with her partner and is canvassing for the first time, targeting homes around The Triangle where the majority of voters are over 45. \u201cEquality has disappeared,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference between the very rich areas [in the constituency] and the ordinary has just become ridiculous. People really need a job and a bit of security here; Corbyn is the only hope for us.\u201d This Labour seaside town west of Cardiff is the third largest in Wales and a century ago was the largest coal-exporting port in the world. \u201cNow, forget the high street \u2013 even our charity shops are closing down,\u201d says Linley. In a Londis shop, customers chat to shop assistant Osian Morris, 24, about the excitement up the road. \u201cHe\u2019s epic \u2013 Corbyn is epic,\u201d says Morris, who counts himself as a lifelong Labour supporter, \u201cpretty much\u201d. A researcher who gives her name as Marie chats to Morris about getting out to vote: she has come from Cardiff to campaign and has been on the phones \u201cevery night for the last two weeks in three-hour shifts\u201d trying to convince constituents to vote the Vale red. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a lot of older people on landlines and a lot of them say they used to vote Labour but that they don\u2019t like Corbyn \u2013 and yet when you press them on it, they can\u2019t seem to give a reason why.\u201d The Vale of Glamorgan holds a number of traditionally Conservative wards including the affluent village of Cowbridge. The Vale is a bellwether seat and local candidate Belinda Loveluck-Edwards is praised effusively by Corbyn on stage for her \u201cfantastic energy\u201d in an exhausting campaign. \u201cShe carries the message of decency and social justice,\u201d says Corbyn, reminding the room to \u201cplease take nothing for granted between now and Thursday\u201d. Babies begin to grizzle but their parents roar as Corbyn makes a slapstick swipe at Boris Johnson and insists victory is nigh. \u201cOur Labour government will go into office next week determined to change a lot of things very, very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not want to live in a country that relies on food banks, debt and handouts for ordinary working people.\u201d After 15 minutes, the crowd gathers for a mass selfie. Builder Gareth Jones, 60, says he has voted Liberal Democrats for most of his life but has been moved by Corbyn\u2019s visit. \u201cHe\u2019s an inspiration. This town is no different to any other under the Tories \u2013 it is suffering, but he offers hope.\u201d At beachfront diner Teddy T\u2019s, where families are lunching on burgers and milkshakes, the election is an unwelcome distraction. One father shrugs at the mention of Corbyn: \u201cI know he came. I\u2019m not voting for him but I\u2019m not going to run him out of town.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
