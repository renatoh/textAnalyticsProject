Top stories The lawyers for Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph have argued that $2.9m in damages awarded to Geoffrey Rush in his defamation case against the paper were \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d and out of line with other high-profile cases. The Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, began its appeal on Monday against the federal court judge Michael Wigney\u2019s ruling that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear in 2015.

There is no shortage of hyperbole when it comes to the print media\u2019s obsession with the Melbourne Cup and Sydney\u2019s Everest. The horse racing writer Ken Callander says race attendances are down but gambling keeps the sport alive. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at the money that\u2019s invested in horse races with the corporate bookmakers and you realise that there\u2019s still a great interest,\u201d Callander told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you go into any hotel or club on a Saturday afternoon \u2026 you\u2019ll be amazed by the interest of the punters in the TAB areas.\u201d Australia Australia\u2019s embrace of a cashless society has seen coin production at the Royal Australian Mint plummet, with revenues from coin sales down more than 30% compared with last year. A 10-year-old girl who lives with Asperger syndrome was hit over the head, pushed from a pier and began hiding in a garbage bin to avoid further bullying, the disability royal commission has been told.

Recommended reads Lucy Clark has drawn back the curtain on Helen Garner\u2019s mind. \u201cMarry the forbidden, voyeuristic pleasure of reading a person\u2019s diaries with the well-known predilections of a writer like Garner, whose reputation for unflinching self-interrogation precedes her, and the anticipation is almost too much,\u201d she writes for Guardian Australia\u2019s The Unmissables. \u201cIs it safe to go in? Do you really want to see the things you will find here?\u201d The past year has been the worst for Australian retail since the 1990 recession, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cIt is clear the tax cuts and interest rate cuts alone are not enough. The latest retail figures are yet more evidence that if the Morrison government wants to have any economic credibility, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook to be released next month must contain some fiscal stimulus measures. And really, given the state of the economy, the government shouldn\u2019t even wait that long.\u201d Listen At a BBC editorial meeting in the 80s, managers discussed how to approach the subject of David Attenborough\u2019s retirement.
