Yesterday's article, written as guest editor of the New Statesman, in which he accused the coalition of powering ahead with radical reforms without a proper mandate, appeared to rattle even the Bishop of Guildford, who was sent out to defend him on the radio. It certainly irritated Downing Street. But at the heart of his comments is a shrewd and important observation. His central contention is that the sense of a society underpinned by mutual responsibility \u2013 the essence of Beveridge \u2013 has been in decline for decades (certainly since his predecessor Robert Runcie tackled Mrs Thatcher about it 30 years ago) and is now on the point of collapse. One piece of evidence for this is the way in which welfare reform is discussed, and the reappearance of Victorian ideas about poverty \u2013 what he calls the \"seductive language\" of \"deserving\" and \"undeserving\" poor. This is not a narrow party-political jibe. The language of reform is a point of contention both within the two coalition parties, and between two Tories, the chancellor, George Osborne, and the welfare secretary, Iain Duncan Smith. It reflects different approaches to state and society. The politics of it are clear from a recent piece of polling for the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, which found that nearly two-thirds of those questioned defined fairness not as any kind of equal shares but as getting what you deserve. In the context of welfare reform, it is a short step from the idea of just deserts to the argument that some poor people are more deserving than others. Not surprisingly, the same poll found overwhelming support for the kind of stringent requirements for those claiming out of work benefits, and sanctions for those who failed to meet them, that are included in the current welfare reform legislation. This is why language matters. Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reform programme is far from perfect but, in an article commissioned by the archbishop, he describes it in the language of empowerment, of supporting marginalised communities. It is a different animal to reforms motivated by assigning merit and penalising those found undeserving, a view that seemed to underlie \u2013 say \u2013 the way George Osborne originally proposed a cap on housing benefit. At least in theory, the Duncan Smith approach is meant to work with the grain of community, and the Osborne version against it. It is the difference between a society of rights and responsibilities and an atomised world of individuals. A fundamental question \u2013 three cheers to Rowan Williams for raising it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
