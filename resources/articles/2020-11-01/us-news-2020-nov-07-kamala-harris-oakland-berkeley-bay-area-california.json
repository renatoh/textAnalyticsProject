Harris was born in neighboring Oakland and lived in Berkeley, where her parents studied at the University of California, Berkeley, until she was 12 years old. She has frequently cited her experiences growing up here as foundational in her political career, including being bussed into wealthier white schools as part of an integration program. Abby Friedman and Dan Schifrin live near Harris\u2019s former home, and on Saturday brought their seven-year-old daughter Elia to see the home where the first female vice-president grew up. They looked on as their daughter, wearing a neon \u201cresist\u201d hat, wrote \u201cwe did it!\u201d in chalk on the sidewalk. \u201cShe\u2019s been on a reading tear, reading biographies of Rosa Parks and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And so she feels it. She feels that Kamala Harris is part of a lineage and she wants to be part of that lineage too,\u201d Schifrin said about his daughter. Leslie Fields-Morris, 54, said she and her friends wandered over to Harris\u2019s house from brunch, where they were celebrating the Biden-Harris victory. They grew up in Oakland and are excited to celebrate a fellow African American woman making it to the White House. \u201cWe are just so proud, seeing an average girl from Oakland running the world,\u201d she said. Harris is the first woman, the first woman of color and the first woman of mixed race to be elected vice-president of the United States. If she became president she would be the first female president, and the second biracial president, in American history. Harris, 56, is the daughter of Indian and Jamaican parents. She grew up in the Bay Area and served as San Francisco district attorney and California\u2019s attorney general before becoming a US senator. She accepted the vice-presidential nomination after ending her own run for president. On the campaign trail, Harris often touted the legacy and work of Black women before her, and her ascension to the vice-presidency is sure to inspire women around the United States. \u201cThe image that we\u2019ll get to see in just a couple of months \u2013 a black woman, the daughter of immigrants, taking the oath of office for vice-president in this country \u2013 is one that will forever have a profound impact for black people and for women and girls! It\u2019s absolutely incredible,\u201d said the San Francisco mayor, London Breed. Oakland\u2019s mayor, Libby Schaaf, congratulated Harris on Twitter: \u201cDaughter of Oakland. You have made us so proud \u2013 so many tears of joy flowing in the Town right now!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m even more proud that my mother gets to see this and my daughter gets to see this,\u201d Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, told MSNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s amazing. It brings tears to my eyes and joy to my heart,\u201d Susan Rice, former UN ambassador, told CNN. \u201cI could not be more proud of Kamala Harris and all that she represents.\u201d In Berkeley, residents stopped to take photos of their children outside Harris\u2019s home. Sarah Zimmerman, a local organizer, wrote in chalk on the sidewalk, \u201cWhen we fight for each other we win.\u201d She said she was celebrating while recognizing the US has a lot of work ahead once Donald Trump leaves office on 20 January. \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief, but it\u2019s not the end. It\u2019s a really good start but there\u2019s a lot more to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
