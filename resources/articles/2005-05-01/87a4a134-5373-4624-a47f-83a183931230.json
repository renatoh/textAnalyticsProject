A well-off boy makes friends with a shanty town kid allowed into his upscale Catholic school by a progressive priest. It's the sort of cinema that tells you at great length what you know already - in this case that the Allende government was flawed but honourable, that the Pinochet coup was grotesque, that 1970s childhoods are to be remembered with bittersweet affection and knowing detail, and that friendships forged across class barriers may come to a terrible end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
