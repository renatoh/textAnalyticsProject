Midway through the second half the manager was regaled with the song that pleads not to \u201ctake my Solskj\u00e6r away\u201d in recognition of the verve and vibrancy on show. He was thrilled. \u201cOur best performance of the season, you can go back to Chelsea [4-0] but today the reaction after they scored was fantastic,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cSometimes this season when you get one up how we didn\u2019t [go on] end up five, six, seven, we don\u2019t know but today was exhilarating, entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves.\u201d There may have been a worrying weakness under the high ball and regarding United\u2019s ruthlessness but, really, this was a convincing exhibition of the Norwegian\u2019s blueprint for his developing side. It was also a memorable day for the left-back Brandon Williams, who was excellent on his full Premier League debut. Of the 19-year-old, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cHe\u2019s making it very hard for me to leave him out.\u201d From the kick-off United were immediately where their manager wants them: on the front foot, with Marcus Rashford, Daniel James and Andreas Pereira bossing proceedings. When James raced down his wing the cross that followed came close to landing on Rashford\u2019s head. A corner was claimed, Pereira delivered and Scott McTominay nearly sneaked in from a left-hand position. This pace of thought and execution would dizzy the Seagulls until the end. Rashford had one of those days when he was close to unplayable, despite a glaring second-half miss. When Pereira fed him on the left the No 10 flashed infield before his shot was saved to Mathew Ryan\u2019s left. Soon after United did find the goal. Anthony Martial passed to Pereira and he drove at Brighton. After too many stepovers he seemed to have lost momentum only for the unfortunate Dale Stephens to hit the ball to Martial. The Frenchman\u2019s first touch was clumsy but he still played Pereira in: the latter\u2019s effort might not have troubled Ryan but Stephens\u2019s deflection this time turned the ball into the net. Two minutes later United had a second. Harry Maguire and Lewis Dunk fought for the ball and when it dropped Davy Pr\u00f6pper, under duress from McTominay, put the ball into his own net. VAR ruled Maguire had not impeded Dunk and United were coasting. United now needed to ensure they remained in control. Instead a Maguire error near halfway led to a Brighton free-kick along the right. Leandro Trossard pinged this in, no red shirt cleared and Dunk might have finished. United\u2019s defence was again poor in the air when Trossard hit another dead ball over from the right as the interval neared. Aaron Connolly was free and, like Dunk, should have scored. Fred has lately started to perform like his \u00a355m price suggests he should. \u201cYou get confidence from playing games,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. A pass he flipped from within a crowd of players near his area was guided into James superbly and after the Welshman sprinted forward and crossed only Dunk\u2019s clearing header denied Rashford a chance to make it 3-0. More of the same with tighter defending might have been Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s orders for the second half. Graham Potter acted by removing Mart\u00edn Montoya and Connolly for Solly March and Glenn Murray. United\u2019s intent was illustrated by a Martial swivel and shot, then a James burst later. When Brighton tried to play out from the back the United front three were a rapid-pressing unit that allowed them scant time. The sense was of United being hungrier than their opponents. Williams followed a yellow card for a high challenge on Steven Alzate by hunting down a throw-in. Brighton\u2019s only hope was if the home team might implode. On 64 minutes there was a glimmer. Fred\u2019s fine performance was marred by a fluffed clearance that led to a corner on the left. Pascal Gross swung this in and, again, United were deficient in the air, Pereira losing Dunk, who powered home. It did not stay 2-1 for long. Fred redeemed himself with a precise 30-yard pass that put Martial through. He turned the ball to Rashford and the striker drilled past Ryan off the bar. Old Trafford was jubilant and within seconds Rashford should have had a second. James\u2019s speed took him clear down the right, he chose the correct option in finding Rashford, yet from three yards and with Ryan stranded, the 22-year-old missed. It did not deter him or his teammates, though. Williams saw his attempt saved by Ryan, then the keeper did the same with a James volley and, at the close, Rashford again might have made it 4-1. This had been impressive from United, though McTominay limping off in added time was a concern. \u201cIt\u2019s an ankle \u2013 I\u2019ve had one and it can be eight weeks, then again it could be two,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r, who said the Scot is to have a scan on Monday so is unlikely to report for international duty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
