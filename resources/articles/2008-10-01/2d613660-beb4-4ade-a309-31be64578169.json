Nostalgia as thick as syrup, sentiment swirling around like one of those brumous pea-soupers which would sometimes roll in off Carmarthen Bay of a sudden to threaten kick-off. Stradey Park is coming down. Not before time. The rusted old gates will be padlocked for a final time after the Scarlets' match against Bristol on Friday evening. They asked me to attend the last rites. I'm not one for wakes, certainly not Welsh ones. I'll be content enough to read as much overwrought journalism as I can stomach about crashball bulldozers moving in to flatten the heroic dreams of men in scarlet and the glistening passages they'd contrived for posterity on this ancient ballfield for over a century and a quarter. Not for this corner to join in: the Welsh have quite enough dingy backroom bars and melancholic minstrels to do full panegyric justice to Friday night's reverie around the misty-eyed muse. But a rich heritage, for sure. Of course, as cathedrals go, Stradey is the most unlikely basilica. It's a tip, always has been. Were they patching it up even before they finished building it? Can any shambolic clutter of prefabricated parking-lot ugliness have ever been so cherished, so treasured, as a sacred shrine? For decades, rugby folk the world over have made solemn hymn-singing pilgrimage across the seas to Stradey. Their last train runs this Friday. The ramshackle old site has housed a famous theatre, though. As an outsider, I've been fortunate witness to no end of telling significance at Stradey - the Strad, incidentally, pronounced with a short, sharp \"a\" as in sad or glad. Both glad and sad, I've been Stradey-ing, on and off, for 40 years. Illuminating opening shaft was that foggy-foggy night of opaque murk in January 1967 when 21-year-old mudlark Barry John gleamingly, smilingly, announced himself with the winning try at the very last against seething, slithering Australians who'd been taunted by the boy's close-quartered, drawn-out dancer's paso-doble chass\u00e9. Us Anglos just looked at each other and mouthed \"Wow!\" Most cathartic afternoon of all was in 1983's crisp-bright springtime sun when the Scarlets played to a packed and empathetic house a tribute exhibition match just a few hours after the Cefneithin funeral of possibly Stradey's most fabled son, Carwyn James - and, by fluke, my splintery old pressbox seat had me placed precisely between two of Carwyn's favourite pupils, Gerald Davies and aforesaid genius John. Closure on Friday of a stark and significant history book, all right. Coal, of course, and iron and copper and steel, and in the last 30 years of the 19th century, in a blink almost, valleys were green no more as 300,000 swarmed into south Wales to sweat blood for toil and labour. Llanelli was tin - \"tinopolis\" it called itself and the town's anthem was Sospan Fach (\"the little saucepan\"). The (rugby) football club (est. 1872) played first on People's Park, alongside the town hall. On August 14 1879, the Llanelly [sic] Guardian reported the club's AGM: \"35 present: It was resolved to find a better place for playing. Matter left to captain and secretary.\" A few issues later, September 18, reported: Llanelly FC successful in getting Stradey cricket ground for practices and matches this season. Mr CW Mansel Lewis has consented to become President.\" A coup. Mansel Lewis, \"Squire of Stradey\", was owner of the Mansel Castle Estates. He declared the club colours should be \"royal navy blue\". The newspaper does not say who decreed that 1881's by now new livery of \"rose and primrose stripes\" had changed in 1883 to \"red and chocolate quarters\". But the world and his wife surely knows that on Easter Monday April 14 1884, as the local Guardian reported: \"The home team were first on the ground, making their first public appearance in full scarlet colours with scarlet, gold-laced caps adding much to their bright appearance.\" All of 124 years on, Stradey no more, those Scarlet heirs regroup now across town in the - in comparison, majestically palatial - 15,000-seater Parc Y Scarlets. The muffled drums sound most evocative of all this week, I suppose, for the day of days, October 31 1972, when the bullying All Blacks were out-bullied and the heroic obsequies will be intoned again for Carwyn and Norman, Delme and Derek, Roy and Ray and Andy, Gareth, Benny and all. And we'll try to recall Max Boyce's lyrics and we'll smile again at the memory of that daft and dinky little cricket scoreboard on the tanner-bank which spelled out for immortality LLANELLI 9 SELAND NEWYDD 3. Famous last words, to be sure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
