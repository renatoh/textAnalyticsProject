It is not large, and neither is my garden, and though I love the wildlife it attracts, it is bringing the tone of the garden down. I cut it early as a result. Will this be a problem? Angela, Gloucestershire A This was common this year, with the wet encouraging excessive, lax growth and wind and rain combining to dash it down again. It is always best to leave cutting your meadows until the end of July to allow them to seed, but this year cutting early stopped any new growth pushing through the fallen stems. The loss of some seeding may well be made up for with a second late flowering of certain species in August. Meadows are an inexact science - one year lost is not a problem. Q Have you any way of getting rid of mind-your-own-business which has got into the lawn? Even treating patches with glyphosate, and facing dead grass before reseeding, does not kill it. Edwina, Camberwell A This low-creeping plant can be a menace in damp, shady conditions. I wonder if your lawn is one that doesn't get enough light, allowing the mind-your-own-business to get the upper hand? Spiking and feeding the lawn will help the grass, which if it is doing well itself should outmuscle the competition. A last resort, because it is always best to go the organic route, would be a selective lawn herbicide, chosen to kill only the broadleaves. The glyphosate, however carefully you apply it, will kill anything green it touches. \u00b7 If you have a gardening question for Dan, email ask.dan@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
