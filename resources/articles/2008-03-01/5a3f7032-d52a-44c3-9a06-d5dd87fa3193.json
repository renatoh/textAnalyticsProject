Many Sunnis have refused to engage in the political process but their vote grew during elections in December 2005. \u00b7 Following months of political deadlock, Nouri Maliki, a Shia politician, was invited to form a government in April 2006 by President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd. \u00b7 The Kurds live mainly in the north, where they have dropped claims for full independence, settling instead for a federal Iraq. \u00b7 An estimated 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the country since the invasion in 2003 and more than one million are thought to have been internally displaced. \u00b7 Tens of thousands of internally displaced people have voluntarily returned to their homes in recent months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
