Not a perfect end for Spurs, as David Hytner points out ... Virgil van Dijk is next in the room. He\u2019s proved to be a decent signing... And now you can see what J\u00fcrgen Klopp has to say. Presumably he\u2019s pleased \u2013 he\u2019s just seen Sid Lowe\u2019s player ratings: Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s press conference is now live \u2013 skip to the end of the video above to watch. Here is Daniel Taylor\u2019s report from Madrid ... \u201cWe need to feel very proud of the effort, how we fought to get to this final. We were very unlucky to concede that goal from the penalty. We played so well in the second half. It\u2019s not easy to play against a team that plays transition very well, taking risks. I feel so proud. We were a little bit unlucky. Being 1-0 down from the start changed the plans completely. It\u2019s not easy. But having been in the Champions League final for the fist time, we have to be optimistic for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning. Use this experience like Liverpool did last year. I\u2019m so pleased to manage this group of players and I congratulate Liverpool because they\u2019ve had a fantastic season. When you live this experience, you want to do it again, to play in the best game in the world after the World Cup.\u201d Just to prove that not all presidents tweet dangerous nonsense, Senegal\u2019s Macky Sall has taken to social media to congratulate his compatriot Sadio Man\u00e9 for the \u201ctalent, discipline and humility\u201d that have helped make him a European champion. Chapeau. \u201cWithout the manager this is impossible. What he\u2019s done in this club is incredible. Not only the players he\u2019s brought in that have made us stronger, but he\u2019s also made the players who were already here better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be part of this football club. I\u2019ve just tried to give my best every time I\u2019ve played football ad help the team. There\u2019s been tough times over my career but I\u2019ve kept going. This is what you\u2019ve done it for. This is the best moment of my life apart from [having] my children.\u201d And to think, back in 2012 Brendan Rodgers was trying to usher Henderson out of the club as he bartered for Clint Dempsey ... and most people at the time (including me) thought that would have been a decent deal. Hats off to Henderson for proving his worth in the most delicious style. Here are Liverpool fans celebrating at the final whistle. It looks like they enjoyed it. While Liverpool milk the glory, Pochettino is probably in the dressing room telling his players to watch and remember their hurt, so they can use it as fuel to go a step farther next time. But he should also reflect on his own decisions here. He got the key selections wrong. Winks did not have the impact he hoped after two months out injured, and nor did Kane, who was allowed to stay on the pitch until the end despite offering next to nothing. At least those players had excuses: some of the others, notably Eriksen, don\u2019t. That said, most Liverpool players were no better, but that bit doesn\u2019t matter now. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for the boys, I\u2019m so happy for all of these people, I\u2019m so happy for my family..... Did you ever see a team like this? Fighting with no fuel in the tank any more. And we had a goalkeeper who makes difficult things look easy. Tonight this is going to be great. This may be the best night of my life, professional wise.\u201d \u201cThis is so important. We have our owners who never put pressure on us, they only support and say \u2018you can deliver this\u2019. They are brilliant.\u201d Asked how he intends celebrating he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Normally when I win, 20 minutes after the game I am already half-pissed ...\u201d The look on Klopp\u2019s face as he thrust the trophy skywards, surrounded by his players, will make for a priceless picture. His team were way below par today and he knows what would have been said if they had been punished with defeat, his seventh in a row in a final. Instead his team prevailed and, with this trophy now under their belt, they are likely to become far more formidable. You\u2019d say this could be the beginning of a dynasty ... if Manchester City weren\u2019t around. As each player takes turns hoisting the trophy high, Liverpool fans serenade them with a lusty and slightly relieved rendition of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Most Spurs fans appear to have left ... Liverpool are at the summit of Europe! Liverpool\u2019s players bounce up to collect their medals and then gather and dance around the trophy, which Jordan Henderson will soon hold aloft. Liverpool give their opponents a guard of honour as Spurs\u2019 players troop up to collect their runners-up medals. They don\u2019t even glance at the trophy standing next to the Uefa president handing out the medals. Liverpool know that pain from last season, and they\u2019ve made amends. A besuited Ian Rush plonks the trophy on its pedestal as Liverpool players stand beside the podium awaiting permission to go grab it... Salah: \u201cEverybody is happy now! I\u2019m very glad to play the second final in a row and the full 90 minutes, finally. It wasn\u2019t a good performance from any of us individually but that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d Alexander-Arnold: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even put into words what;s just happened. With the season we\u2019ve had we deserved it more than any other team. We\u2019ve beaten everyone put in our path, We were probably dominated for the main part of the game but we showed we\u2019re a world class side and can win any way. When we look back tonight we\u2019re not going to think it was a sluggish game, we\u2019re going to think we\u2019ve just won the European Cup! I\u2019m just a normal lad from Liverpool who\u2019s dream just come true.\u201d Origi: \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. I\u2019m happy that I could play my part but every single guy fought so hard today.\u201d Des Kelly of BT nabs Salah for an interview, then notices that the rest of the Liverpool team are about to sprint off in unison towards the red-clad fans for a big loving cheer: so he advises Salah to dash off and join his teammates, which the Egyptian does with gusto. It\u2019s all smiles and back slaps among the Liverpool players. And Pochettino, classy to the end, walks among them to shake hands and congratulate them, after commiserating with his own players. Liverpool are European champions for the sixth time! Don\u2019t bother telling them it was a boring final because they don\u2019t care! Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi scored the goals that mean a wonderful season for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team most definitely did not end in an anti-climax. They are legends! Klopp has his first trophy with the club he has transformed and uplifted, and Spurs leave with a lot of credit for making it this far, but regrets with how flat they fell on the big stage. 90+4 min: You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone is reverberating around the stadium as Spurs flail around in search of consolation. It\u2019s not happening. 90 min: There will be at least five more minutes ... 90 min: Joe Gomez is a Champions finalist, having just come on in place of Man\u00e9. 89 min: Fabinho\u2019s role in that goal was nice. HE showed coolness as the ball bobbled around the area to flick it to Origi, who finished perfectly. For a player who seldom starts, Origi has scored some huge goals for Liverpool. It\u2019s going to take a comeback better that surpasses anything we\u2019ve seen so far this season for Spurs to prevent Liverpool from winning this now. Spurs fail to clear a corner from Milner, and Liverpool work it to Origi in the left-hand side of the box. The Belgian steads himself and smacks a good low shot into the far corner! 86 min: Tripper delivers an outswinger ... Moura meets it eight yards out, shotting into the ground ... Son tries to redirect it towards goal from close range but heads over! He was offside anyway. but Moura\u2019s chance was a good one, if only he\u2019d caught it properly! 85 min: Eriksen goes for the far corner ... and Alison springs to his right to push it behind for a corner. 84 min: Rose beats Milner to a dropping ball at the edge of the area and then goes down under contact from the midfielder. Freekick to Spurs on the right-hand side of the box, close to the corner. Eriksen nudges it a little closer to the corner to give himself a more favourable shooting position... 83 min: Milner is the latest player to muck up a corner, failing to beat the first defender. 82 min: Spurs substitution: Llorente on, Alli off. 80 min: Son unloads one from out of the blue, from 25 yards. It\u2019s struck hard and true and Alisson parries it with difficulty. Spurs get it back into the danger area quickly and Moura fires off a low toe-punter. Alisson saves this one more easily. Liverpool need to wake up. 78 min: Liverpool have dropped back and challenged Spurs to open them up. They work Trippier into space down the right and he clips over a dainty cross. Alli gets his nut to it but sends his effort over from seven yards. And, it turns ut, he fouled Matip anyway so Liverpool have a freekick. 77 min: I\u2019m not sure that Kane has touched the ball in this half. 75 min: A Liverpool attack founders and suddenly Spurs are on the charge. Son tries to run through the heart of their defence and for a moment it looks like he can do it, but then Van Dijk shifts into top gear and eases him off the ball. 74 min: Spurs substitution: Dier on, Sissoko off. The Frenchman may have been injured, he seemed to pick up a strain of some sort. 73 min: The game is loosening up now. Quality isn\u2019t exactly soaring but gaps are opening up. Son skitters towards the Liverpool area and slips the all wide to Alli, who tries a dinky, Deulofue-esque lob over Alisson. But he doesn\u2019t catch it right and it\u2019s a comfortable save for the keeper. 71 min: Alison catches the Spurs\u2019 defence out with a quick long kick to Salah, wide on the right. Salah finds Man\u00e9 at the edge of the area but he runs into trouble, allowing Spurs to clear. 70 min: Vertonghn flights a fine long pass from deep to Tripper wide on the right. The fullback delivers a fine cross in the danger zone ... but there\u2019s no teammates there to get on the end of it! 69 min: Man\u00e9 skins Eriksen in midfield and scampers towards the box, zipping the ball in to Salah near the penalty spot. Salah lays it back to Milner, who takes one touch and then lashes a low effort just wide from the edge of the box! Good play! 67 min: Alexander-Arnold donks a pitiful corner to the near post, where Son whacks clear. Even the setpieces have been diabolical today, except for Salah\u2019s penalty. 66 min: Spurs substitution: Moura on, Winks off. Eriksen drops a little deeper. 65 min: At the risk of repeating myself, this is very scrappy. Neither team can string a series of passes together. This is a great advertisement for rugby, or ice hockey or drinking. 62 min: Another Liverpool substitution: Milner on, Wijnaldum off. The Dutchman made no impression. 60 min: \u201cEriksen needs a big game now, he has hid so many times this season,\u201d snaps Mark Goodchild. NO sign of him here yet. And on that note, he tries a shot from 30 yards. It\u2019s a low whizzer than Van Dijk blocks at the edge of the area. 58 min: Liverpool substitution: Origi on, Firmino off. The Brazilian has not looked fit and was unable to make much of a contribution. Same goes for Kane, who I expect to be replaced by Moura soon. I can\u2019t see any justification for leaving him on the pitch. 57 min: Alisson punches a away the corner to the edge of the area. Rose tires to lash it back at goal but Salah deflects it wide. Vertonghen meets the corner beyond the back post but can only guide a soft header a couple of yards over the bar. 56 min: Son tries to wriggle into the box and deliver a cross. Robertson makes a block at the expense of a corner. 55 min: Robertson curls over a vicious cross from the left. Lloris does well to snaffle it before Man\u00e9 can pounce. 54 min: Wijnaldum releases Salah with a cute pass from deep. The Egyptian heads into the box, from the right-hand side. Vertonghen stands up to him ... and Salah tries to use him as a blind as he aims a curler towards the far corner. But Vertonghen is wise to his game and blocks. 53 min: A nice cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold floats just beyond Salah. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t pick up, this might end up being the worst Champions League final ever,\u201d snalrs Kari Tulinius. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a duller spectacle. Admittedly I missed the Milan-Juve nil-nil in 2003, but every Champions League final has been full of incident and fun. Anyway, here\u2019s hoping for a crazy second half.\u201d I\u2019ll give you a duller spectacle: Red Star Belgrade 0-0 Marseille in the 1991 final, which, like this one, was painful because both teams had been so thrilling on their way to the final. Mind you, back then the problem was that Red Starr decided early on to play for penalties: here it\u2019s that neither team can get going. 49 min: It\u2019s still very scrappy. You know that both managers will have urged the players before kickoff to do their utmost to ensure they don\u2019t come away full of regrets. Well, whoever loses this will agonise for ever over their non-performance ... unless they buck up their ideas pronto. 47 min: Spurs build well down the right, with Trippier releasing Son and then following up to receive the layback. He hoists a cross to the back post, over Alexader-Arnold. Alli tries to head it back across goal but misdirects it. 46 min: Spurs get the second half going... Here comes the players. Let\u2019s hope they were all given a good boot up the backside during the break... \u201cAs a Spurs fan you wonder how many ways we can invent to shoot ourselves in the foot,\u201d drawls Mike Nagle. \u201cSissoko has been great all season but to flail your arms around in the penalty area is dumb. The match needs to liven up. I hope Kane gets a hat trick but it was equally dumb to start him &amp; leave out Moura, the hat trick hero. If you had to include Kane leave Ali out, he has been poor most of the season. Here\u2019s hoping for a better second half.\u201d \u201cI hope Spurs come back and win simply because I want Liverpool to go down in history as the only team to lose two Champions League finals in a row,\u201d snips Greg Rollins, who just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Juventus and Valencia have previously lose two finals in a row. In the BT studio, all the talk is about the penalty decision, partly because there\u2019s not been much else to discuss apart from the non-performances of so many fine players. All the pundits- except Glenn Hoddle - think giving a penalty was the right decision because Sissoko\u2019s arm was outstretched (he was pointing at a position where he wanted a teammate to go) and therefore he blocked Mane\u2019s pass illegally. Hoddle contends that that might have been a fair interpretation if the ball had struck his arm directly but since it rebounded on to his arm off his chest, it\u2019s a bad call. \u201cI live for the final, the showpiece, on many occasions it lets you down, but it\u2019s still unmissable,\u201d says Bernard Folan. \u201cThis game is simply abysmal. While not a fan of spurs, if they could string two passes together they could win this. Danny Rose is the only player not afraid of the situation, fair balls to him. Pochettino could win this, winks off, Moura on.\u201d Or Kane off. Liverpool go for their tea with a one-goal lead thanks to Salah\u2019s penalty in the first minute. But there\u2019s not much else for them to be pleased about because this has been a messy half in which Spurs have passed slightly better. It was jittery fare and quite a grim spectacle, evidence that the three-week buildup was too long: can\u2019t help thinking that if this match had been played one week after the end of the Premier League, it would have been a more vibrant affair. Kane and Firmino wouldn\u2019t have been fit for that, of course, but neither of them have had any impact here so far. Let\u2019s hope for a big improvement in the second half from both teams. Victory is there for either one, even if Liverpool currently have the edge. 45 min: Another Spurs attacking initiated by Son concludes with Eriksen shanking a shot 10 yards over from the edge of the area. Symptomatic off a dreadful first half, truth be told. 44 min: Spurs spring forward on a three-on-three attack! But Alli botches it by overhitting a pass intended for Son. That\u2019s easy pickings for Alisson. 43 min: A change of strategy as Salah takes the corner. He might not get another one, as this went straight to Son at the near post. The Korean walloped it away. 41 min: Vertonghen is back in the action, just in time to see Liverpool elevate the quality of this game a tad. After promising bursts by Henderson and Firmino, Alexander-Arnold wins a corner, which he takes himself. Spurs scramble it out for another one, on the far side. 39 min: Vertonghen is receiving treatment, seemingly to an injured elbow. he looks to be in quite a bit of pain. 38 min: Thats more like it! Matip spoon a decent pass wide to Robertson on the left. The Scot hurries forward and unloads a stinging shot from distance that Lloris pushes over with one hand! 37 min: Truth be told, this has been only marginally better than the first half of Arsenal-Chelsea the other day. It\u2019s all very well English teams hogging all the final spots, but it\u2019s be nice if they put on a bette show than this. 35 min: Superb play by Henderson, up to a point. He did well to cut out a loose lofted pass by Alderweireld inside the Tottenham half, and then cleverly headed into space where he could run on to it himself down the right. But then he spaffed his cross out of play. 34 min: Kane, who\u2019s barely been involved so far, flicks the ball on to Son, Spurs\u2019 most dangerous player. Two Liverpool players converge on him near the byline and deflect his cross out of play. 32 min: Sissoko, in the D, tries to slip a pass through to Son, dashing in from the left. Matip makes a critical interception. 30 min: It\u2019s been a strange game. Quite slow, possibly because of the heat, and a little scruffy, possibly because of nerves. You get the feeling that if one team can truly pull themselves together, they could take this game away from the opposition. Liverpool have the lead but aren\u2019t really flowing. 27 min: A Foul on Man\u00e9 gives Liverpool a freekick about 35 yards out, bang central. Alexander-Arnold fancies it. But he doesn\u2019t shoot, instead he drops a cross to where he hoped runners would be. But there was no one there. 25 min: A pause in play as Trippier receives treatment after being caught by Robertson. Nothing much to it. By the way, regarding the penalty in the first minute: if they\u2019re going to be giving spotkicks for handballs in that situation - Sissoko could not get out of the way - then expect players to start aiming for opponents\u2019 hands from close range. 24 min: Another Liverpool corner. Another delivery by Alexander-Arnold, this time short to Henderson, who whips it in. Winks heads clear. 23 min: Robertson sends over a fine cross from the left. His counterpart, Rose, does brilliantly to clear it at the backpost. Liverpool are improving ... 22 min: Lloris gets a good punch to Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery, which was deposited right on top of the keeper. They appear to have identified the keeper as a weakness. 21 min: Salah scurries infield from the left and swaps passes with Firmino before opening fire from 20 yards. His shot is deflected behind for a corner. 20 min: Spurs are exerting serious pressure around the box now. They\u2019ve got their passing going and are making Liverpool look a little lethargic, as if they scored too early. 19 min: Sissoko does well to get between Robertson and the ball as the Scot flew down the left. Then the Frenchman sees it out of play for a goalkick. 17 min: Fabinho wins the ball in midfield and nudges it to Henderson, who brings Alexander-Arnold into lay. From 30 yards wide on the right the youngster unleashes a stinging low drive, which whistle just past the post. 16 min: It\u2019s quite a slow game at the minute. The onus is on Spurs to do something to discomfort Liverpool but so far they haven\u2019t come up with anything despite having plenty of the ball. But Liverpool would be well advised to do more to get more of the ball. 14 min: Vertonghen sprays a fine 60-yard crossfield pass to Tripper, who knocks it back to Eriksen. The Dane eschews the chance to cross it into the box, where several teammates were waiting, and instead plays it backwards, losing momentum. 12 min: Matip clatters into Kane wide on the right. Not bad enough for a booking, and Spurs waste the freekick. 11 min: Man\u00e9 wins a corner for Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold delivers. Lloris, surrounded by players, gets a weak punch on it, but a teammate completes the clearances, whacking it way downfield. 9 min: Dangerous dribbling by Son down the left and into the box. Lovely quick feet, almost reminiscent of Moura for his second goal against Ajax. Except that this time Henderson intervenes. When the ball breaks to a Spurs player 25 yards out, Sissoko smashes it high and wide. 8 min: Spurs are having plenty of the ball, as Liverpool decide not to press high and instead lure their opponents forward and try to strike on the counter. 6 min: Alexander-Arnold, the youngest player to start successive finals in the history of the Champions League, does well to dispossess Alli and welly the ball clear. 5 min: Tripper curls an in-swinging corner into the danger zone, where Van Dijk leaps above Veretonghen and heads clear. 4 min: Spurs win a corner after Alli nicks the ball off Alexander-Arnold at the corner of the box. 3 min: If this season\u2019s Champions League has reminded us of anything, it\u2019s that one-goal leads are nothing. Maybe Spurs will let in another two before they\u2019re roused to action ... The Egyptian hammers it past Lloris, who dived the right way but couldn\u2019t stop it. What a start! Sissoko unintentionally blocked a pass by Man\u00e9 with his arm! It hit his chest first and rebounded on to his arm. 1 min: The 2019 Champions League final is go! Liverpool get it going, with Firmino knocking the ball backwards to Van Dijk, who spanks it wide towards the right-hand corner. Before kickoff, there is a minute\u2019s applause in memory of Jos\u00e9-Antonio Reyes, the former Arsenal player who died today in a car accident at the age of 35. \u201cI\u2019m at the O\u2019Hare (Chicago) *international* terminal and the restaurant with two TVs is showing a baseball game and horse racing features,\u201d wails Gregory Crawford. The players enter the arena to a soundtrack of the Champions League jingle played live by violinists flanking the exit of the tunnel. When they stop, the crowd roar their approval for everything that is about to take place. It\u2019s nearly on! The teams are in the tunnel ... \u201cMy underwear is blue and I am regretting it,\u201d sighs Robert Smith (I always thought he was QPR fan). \u201cI may be commando by the 13th minute if LFC are off to a slow start.\u201d Just like heaven, eh. \u201cIt\u2019s about 00:17 hrs in Mumbai, India, and my six-month old daughter has decided to stay up and chuckle at the telly,\u201d writes Irshad Daftari. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be a long night, either way.\u201d \u201cI appreciate Simon McMahon\u2019s support,\u201d announces Matt Dony. \u201cBut I\u2019ll level with you; I\u2019m scared. Terrified. Like, amazingly scared. Liverpool proved in the league that they are objectively better than Spurs. But. But. But, it means nothing. It\u2019s a night where I can\u2019t really think for myself, and I have to rely on cliches. Anything could happen. It\u2019s the hope I can\u2019t stand. Argh!!!! Football!!!\u201d The atmosphere in the stadium is reaching wonderpoint. It looks close to full and both sets of fans are singing their hearts out. A far, far better vibe than for that Europa League final on Wednesday. Pochettino is asked whether he is sure kane is 100% fit. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he replies. \u201cWe believe and feel that in the last few weeks he was ready to compete. We gave him time to feel the motion and combination and yesterday he confirmed he was ready to play. Klopp\u2019s take on Kane\u2019s selection: \u201cWe expected it. But even if Lucas Moura would have played, the quality is massive that they have up front.\u201d \u201cEven in one family, the Champions League has gone global,\u201d announces Keith Leslie. \u201cI\u2019m watching here in Portland, Oregon, one son is watching in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, while my other son is watching in Kathmandu, Nepal. Our friends glued to their tubes in Seattle, Washington, DC, Bangkok and even balmy England. I\u2019ve been an American Reds fan since the drama of Istanbul and can\u2019t wait for more heroics today!\u201d Very good. I\u2019m sitting in my underwear in my front room. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to watch the final with my three week old daughter,\u201d reveals Kyle Green. \u201cI hope she brings us luck. Come on you Reds!\u201d You do realise that if Liverpool win, you\u2019re now going to have to have a child before every major final they play, right? \u201cNot that it\u2019s bothered me for the past 35 years, but when Liverpool won Big Cup on penalties in 1984 against Roma, it really should have been Dundee United they were facing,\u201d sobs Simon McMahon. \u201cImagine that - England v Scotland in the biggest club game in Europe, in the days when you actually had to be league champions to take part. Much to admire about both sides tonight, and may the best team win, though with ex-United lad Andy Robertson a key player, I\u2019m siding with Matt Dony\u2019s Liverpool.\u201d Public service announcement: \u201cA fan has parked his van in the square where I live in Madrid,\u201d writes Geoffrey Goff. \u201cCan you put out a message to warn him that it will be towed away by the police UNLESS it is moved by 7am local time tomorrow because the square is part of the huge Rastro weekly street market? If you don\u2019t know the area, this is not at all clear\u2026 It is a company van owned by [company name redacted in case the van driver didn\u2019t have permission to drive to Madrid in it] from Essex. It must belong to a fan and I\u2019d hate him or her to wake up to the news that their vehicle is in the police pound, especially after driving all the way here! Thanks and I hope someone will see the message who can pass it on\u2026\u201d \u201cNot that anyone from London or Liverpool cares, but it\u2019s impressive to see seven former Southampton FC players in the Champions League final,\u201d notes Andrew Read. Plus a former Saints manager, of course. \u201cIf Liverpool win I don\u2019t like football anymore and won\u2019t get into a conversation about it,\u201d chirps Oliver Atkinson. \u201cYours sincerely, a Manchester united fan living about 20 miles south of Liverpool.\u201d I don\u2019t get it: who are Manchester United? \u201cI loved the email about lucky G&amp;Ts,\u201d yelps Toias Peggs. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything possible or to make the universe pull the same trick again. I\u2019m a Brit in NYC and a long suffering Spurs fan. I happened to be back in England for the semi second leg - and am now sat here in my New York apartment sat in the same shirt, jeans, underwear, socks and shoes I wore on that magical night. Come on universe. And come on your spurs!\u201d Crystal Palace\u2019s chairman, Steve Parish, is in Madrid today. Surely not negotiating the transfers of Wilf Zaha and Aaron Wan-Bissaka already? Maybe, maybe not, but\u2019s also found some fan\u2019s ticket and told how they can be reunited with it: The teams are out limbering up on the pitch. Judging by the sounds, there are ore Liverpool fans in the stadium at the moment than Spurs, because there were loud boos as the north Londoners took to the field. \u201cDo you have a special Champions League Final routine to limber up your typing fingers or is it business as usual?\u201d inquires Peter Oh. For special occasions like this I only wash my fingers with five-euro bottles of water. So yeah, they\u2019re filthy. \u201cIf tonight\u2019s proceedings were a film, I\u2019d call it A Wish Called Wanda, with quality performances, some biting comedy and a happy ending for Liverpool. The loser will feel like they\u2019ve had chips stuffed up their nose. I wonder if the local Atletico fans will be rooting for Liverpool, as Spurs\u2019 white uniform has more than a faint whiff of Real?\u201d Let\u2019s talk about the goalkeepers. Alisson has very occasional moments of laxity with the ball at his feet but is otherwise immaculate. He clearly gives confidence to his defenders. Hugo Lloris, on the other hand, may has had a sketchy season and a bit. He\u2019s still capable of magnificent saves but also of odd lapses and rash decision-making. It seems silly to stay of a captain who lifted the World Cup last summer and could lift the Champions League today, but he\u2019s a weakness in my book. \u201cI spent the semi-final return leg in a godawful Premier Inn room in Aintree, probably the only place in Merseyside that night where no-one appeared to be watching the match or, indeed, to be alive,\u201d reveal Phil Sawyer. \u201cI watched it on my laptop drinking cans of warm supermarket gin and tonic and eating cold potato wedges, and it was one of the best nights of my life. So tonight I\u2019ve stocked up on more tins of generic supermarket G&amp;T, and the wedges are already cooling. I reserve the right to run down to Lincoln Travelodge and make an immediate booking if, as I suspect, the Reds are three down at half time.\u201d Admit it, you started tucking into that bargain G&amp;T hours ago. Alex Kay-Jelski, sports editor for The Times, has been tweeting about his experience trying to make it to the stadium. \u201cSpanish police scarily aggressive. Towards kids too. Creating trouble, not helping with anything #ucl. They\u2019ll literally pushing people who are just walking down the street. Massively aggressive. I\u2019ll be amazed if all fans in ground in time for KO. Being funneled into single file up against railings. Dangerous.\u201d A disturbing dispatch from a man in the stadium: \u201cHello Paul, it\u2019s a disgrace in the Liverpool end - five euro for water,\u201d emails Kris Pugh. \u201cEveryone has been on the ale all day. Been debating with the staff they weren\u2019t bothered.\u201d That\u2019s outrageous exploitation. So Kane starts, as does Harry Winks, who has also been out of action since for the last seven weeks. Pochettino is going for it. That augurs well for the spectacle. For what it\u2019s worth, if it\u2019s going to be a ding-dong, I foresee Liverpool winning, possibly like in the emphatic style of old. Tottenham: Lloris; Trippier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose; Eriksen, Winks, Sissoko, Son; Alli; Kane Subs: Vorm Gazzaniga, Sanchez, Lamela, Wanyama, Dier, Walker-Peters, Llorente, Foyth, Aurier, Moura, Davies Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9 Subs: Mignolet, Kelleher, Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Sturridge, Moreno, Lallana, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Shaqiri, Brewster, Origi Referee: D Skomina (Slovenia) Liverpool have posted their starting lineup on their official twitter thing. Looks like Wijnaldum\u2019s heroics off the bench agaisnt Bar\u00e7a have got him back into the XI. Good. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9 \u201cImagine boarding a plane for a three-hour flight to London RIGHT NOW,\u201d sniffs Sam. \u201cI don\u2019t even support either team but the frustration is immense. My Gooner wife seems to be quite content to have her head in the clouds for a bit though.\u201d Spurs players are out having a stroll around the pitch, trying to familiarise themselves with the surrounds. But there are only a couple of thousand fans in their at the moment - no doubt the other 60,000 still have their snouts in plastic pint glasses. This place is going to feel very different come kickoff. \u201cI figure this is appropriate given both side\u2019s rocky road to the final, and in tribute to one of the most spine-tingling voices to jump out of a set of stereo speakers,\u201d croons Grant Tennille. \u201cAs a Gooner I can assure you I\u2019ll be listening to their cover of \u2018Baby Blue\u2019 should things go pear-shaped for Liverpool. It\u2019s on!\u201d Here come Liverpool in their bright red bus. As if to demonstrate that European finals are run of the mill to them, they\u2019re all wearing tracksuit and trainers, including Klopp. No shirts and ties for them. They\u2019re full of smiles and japes as they make their way to the dressing room, too. If your thinking is guided by body language, then expect Liverpool to make the more vibrant start. The Spurs\u2019 bus has arrived at the stadium. Pochettino and his players disembark and stride stone-faced towards the dressing room in smart black suits, shirts and ties. Guess Poch picked the outfits. Talking of penalty shootout, that\u2019s something we certainly have to factor into our pre-match thoughts: because English teams don\u2019t do emphatic victories in European Cup finals. Manchester United and Liverpool got things off to a misleading start with a 4-1 victory (1968) and 3-1 victory (1977) respectively. None of the English victories since then have been by more than one goal, and the last three have been through shootouts. Team selection pickle: Pochettino has a big call to make in his starting lineup: does he or doesn\u2019t he start Kane? There are rumours that he has plumped for the England striker and decided to drop Lucas Moura to the bench. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d have gone the other way on the basis that Moura\u2019s speed and mobility are more likely to trouble Liverpool\u2019s defence than Kane and also, if Kane starts he is unlikely to finish, given he has not played at all since suffering injury in the first leg of the quarter-final against Man City on April 9. So he probably won\u2019t be taking a penalty if it goes that far. A quick reminder that the Video Assistant Referee will be in use today. At least that is the plan and let\u2019s hope things don\u2019t go awry like they did in yesterday\u2019s African Champions League final second leg. VAR was supposed to be used in that, too, and would have been of tremendous benefit to Wydad Casablanca after their equaliser against Esp\u00e9rance was chalked off for an incorrect offside. But despite intense lobbying by Wydad staff and players, the referee refused to consult Var \u2013 apparently because he couldn\u2019t: the company that provides the technology claimed they told organisers before the game that airlines had lost some of their equipment in transit so Var would not be operational for the match, a detail that the organisers allegedly did not disclose to the teams beforehand. \bSo after the non-goal, play was stopped as players and officials argued on the pitch and sidelines for an hour and a half before Wydad announced they had no faith in the organisers and would not play. So Esp\u00e9rance won on a walkover. Let\u2019s have none of that carry-on today please! Fans are starting to filter into the stadium. Here are some shots of them enjoying themselves around Madrid: Here\u2019s Danny Taylor on what victory for either team might mean: We\u2019ve been catching up with Spurs and Liverpool fans ahead of the big day: Let\u2019s begin with the latest news and video from Friday\u2019s press conferences: Hello and welcome to coverage of the 64th European Cup/Champions League final, the ninth featuring Liverpool and the very first one with Tottenham Hotspur. Not many people expected Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team to make it this far but now that they are here, thanks to two of the most dramatic victories in the tournament\u2019s history \u2013 first over Manchester City and then over Ajax \u2013 they intend to make off with the big prize. Just imagine! Tottenham: European champions despite not being English champions since 1961, back when Elvis\u2019s Wooden Heart was top of the hit parade! For now, though, that is still just a wild dream for Spurs, and Liverpool intend to make sure it stays that way. They have been authors of some spectacular dramas themselves this season \u2013 just ask Lionel Messi \u2013 and they want this trophy badly. They came agonisingly close to lifting it last season, just as they came agonisingly close to lifting the Premier League this season, and they will be distraught if they do not leave Madrid today as kings of Europe for a sixth time. But not for one second will J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men be anticipating a straightforward win. It matters not a jot that Liverpool have already beaten Spurs twice this season en route to finishing 28 points above them on the domestic front. Sure, Liverpool know they can hurt Spurs but they and we are also well aware that Spurs have the tools to trouble them. This battle promises to be a belter. There are many, many ways it could be decided and many wonderful players who will play roles in tilting it one way or the other. In a few hours the old big-eared trophy will be heading to an English city beginning with L but for now we can\u2019t say more than that other than (1) don\u2019t get your hopes up, Lincoln, and (2) Bring It On! Kick-off is at 8pm, BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
