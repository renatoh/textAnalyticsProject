Since 1989, circulation is down 51% to 12,549 for the Birmingham Post; 49% to 70,028 for the Leicester Mercury; 43% to 50,256 for the Northern Echo; 62% to 32,874 for the Argus in Sussex; 38% to 38,844 for the Echo in Southend; 38% to 36,516 for the Herald in Plymouth; 49% to 20,976 for the Oldham Evening Chronicle; 46% to 19,956 for the Halifax Evening Courier. North, south, east, west, large, small, morning and evening, the story for Britain's local papers is one of unremitting gloom. Scarcely a month passes without news of further cutbacks. Last week, all 300 editorial staff on Trinity Mirror's Midlands titles, including the Birmingham Post and Coventry Telegraph, were told they will have to reapply for their jobs. After restructuring, more than 20% may be out of work (a report from Coventry's newsroom follows below this column). Johnston Press, another big group, is cutting budgets and jobs at papers such as the Scotsman and the Sheffield Star. The company's share price, 393p a year ago, was down to 53.50p last Friday and, at one stage, went as low as 30p. Yet it is not obvious, even taking account of the internet, local radio and freesheets, that the regional press was always doomed to this fate. A few national newspapers, such as the Mirror and Express, have suffered similar declines over the past 20 years, but most have not - and some, such as the Times and Mail, now sell more copies, even though the competition they face is more intense. Magazines such as the Economist and Spectator also flourish. In opinion polls, people frequently complain about the London-centric national media. Why have regional and local papers failed to fill the gap? The usual answer is that publishers have cut too much, leaving too few reporters too little time to dig out news that might grip readers' attention. Despite the circulation declines, the local press, until very recently, enjoyed buoyant advertising revenues and profit margins sometimes above 30%. Surely, journalists say, publishers should lower margins and protect their own future. But this misunderstands how capitalism works. As investors see it, perhaps rightly, newspapers have few prospects for growth, even if they are well-managed. With no expectations of long-term gains, they demand high, short-term dividends. The recent plunge in share prices shows how quickly investors pull out when profits fall. Most national newspapers are, to some extent, protected from this crude capitalist logic because, even if they are not run by a Guardian-style trust, individuals such as Rupert Murdoch and Tony O'Reilly, seeking influence or kudos, hold controlling stakes. Cuts are clearly a big part of the story. But we need also to consider what Bob Franklin of Cardiff University's media school has called the McDonaldisation of journalism, delivering \"predictable and standardised newspapers\". As Franklin points out, \"the local press is now virtually a tabloid press\". That is true not just in page size - the Birmingham Post, one of the last broadsheets, will go tabloid as part of Trinity Mirror's reorganisation - but also in editorial approach. Open any local paper now, whether you are in Bath or Barnsley, and you get the same diet of health, family, travel and consumer issues, plus human interest stories, all presented in the same way. Court cases and council meetings, once staple material for the local press, are largely ignored. Few papers convey any sense of covering local community life. The editorial agenda is often remarkably similar to that of the national redtops. For example, my local paper in Essex writes obsessively about the comedian Michael Barrymore who, though he lives locally in the house where a man mysteriously drowned in 2001, is hardly a local figure. The local papers' loss of locality is part of the same phenomenon that has created \"clone towns\" where high streets are dominated by chain stores and look the same from Cornwall to Cumbria. Locally owned papers have disappeared just like locally owned shops and restaurants: five publishing groups control about 80% of circulation. And, as national governments have taken more power, local politics has declined. If papers judge that readers are no longer interested in council meetings, they are probably right. In other words, the decline of the local press is another aspect of the homogenisation of British life. Is there any hope of salvation? Publishers and editors are cottoning on to the idea that people are still interested in local news, provided it is local enough and covers, at most, a single postcode area with a maximum population of 30,000. Trinity Mirror, for example, has tried \"hyperlocal\" websites in Teesside and believes it can \"reverse publish\" them by printing the copy, much of it user-generated, in free papers. Hyperlocality, however, involves treading a fine line. Somehow, an editor has to overcome what has been called \"the pothole paradox\". To you, news of repairs on your own street, or on your route to the pub, is far more interesting than, say, a plane crash in Madrid, but similar news from a mile away is the most boring thing imaginable. Whoever finds a solution to that conundrum, and develops a business model to sustain it, will surely be hailed as the saviour of the local press. Lazy journalism gets mentally stronger I think of it as my Atlantic Monthly moment. That distinguished American magazine once prepared a fine cover story with the headline \"Peace is hell\". Between it going to press and it hitting the newsstands, 9/11 happened. On a less apocalyptic note, I wrote an Observer book review explaining why the British are always losers at sport. It appeared in the middle of what the Guardian's Richard Williams called \"a weekend of intoxicating and almost unrelieved success\" for our Olympics team, which rose to third in the medals table. So I sympathised as I heard the grinding of newspaper gears. Out with those perennial stories, which journalists had been composing in their heads for weeks, about how our welfare state makes young people lazy, our food makes them unfit and our schools make them uncompetitive. In, as the Daily Telegraph headlined, came \"the Great British Olympics\". Our youth were now lean, fit, healthy, dedicated, energetic, and (sports journalists make a lot of this point) mentally strong. But the Daily Mail will always bring us down to earth. \"What those gold medals tell us about a very divided Britain\", read its main comment page headline. Forty per cent of the winners, Leo McKinstry pointed out, went to fee-paying private schools, who educate fewer than 10% of the nation's children. The usual Mail culprits were named and shamed: state schools' failure to encourage excellence, the excess of women teachers in primary schools, and \"the health and safety brigade\". In the Telegraph, Boris Johnson - writing, as usual, without engaging any part of his body from the wrist upwards - embarrassed his party leader by suggesting Beijing showed talk of a \"broken society\" to be \"piffle\". How reassuring, in an ever-changing world, to know that the Mail at least remains firm in its convictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
