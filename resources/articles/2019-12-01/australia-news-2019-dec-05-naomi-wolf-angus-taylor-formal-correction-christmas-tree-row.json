On Thursday morning the US author said she called Taylor\u2019s parliamentary office requesting a \u201cformal correction\u201d to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor \u201ctell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?\u201d She tweeted several excerpts before publishing the 29-minute recording in full. In 2013 Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament while recounting an anecdote about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and a dispute about a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of \u201cantisemitic dogwhistling\u201d. In the call with Taylor\u2019s staffer, Wolf repeatedly requested that his office issue a public correction to say she was not at Oxford at the same time as him, and that she was not part of a group of people campaigning against Christmas. In his 2013 speech Taylor said: \u201cIt was 1991, and a young Naomi Wolf lived a couple of doors down the corridor. Several graduate students, mostly from the north-east of the US, decided we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended. I was astounded. \u201cIn our times, the world over, the foundation of democracy \u2013 free speech \u2013 and the foundation of capitalism \u2013 property rights \u2013 are being chipped away by shrill elitist voices who insist that they know what is best for people who are not remotely like them.\u201d The anecdote was repeated in a 2014 profile in the Australian Financial Review. Taylor\u2019s staffer told Wolf that was the AFR\u2019s reporting, and not a claim sourced from Taylor\u2019s office. Wolf said on Monday she was \u201clong back in the US\u201d and no longer at Oxford by 1991. \u201cI was a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d \u201cCatch that anti-Semitic dogwhistle \u2013 elitist people \u2018who know what\u2019s best for people who are not remotely like them.\u2019 Referring to Jews like me whom Angus Taylor imagined to be among the warriors against xmas in Oxford in 1991.\u201d Taylor rejected the accusation he was antisemitic, with a spokesman noting that his grandmother was Jewish. His office insisted Taylor recalled seeing Wolf at Oxford, although they clarified the minister\u2019s speech was not referring to Wolf as one of the graduates who campaigned against the Christmas tree. Taylor is the subject of multiple controversies, including a NSW police investigation after his office provided a doctored document to the media as part of a political attack on the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore. A Senate committee this week found Taylor \u201cconsciously used his position as an MP and minister\u201d to try to influence an investigation into clearing of grasslands at a property he and his family part-own, and recommended the prime minister order an inquiry. Taylor\u2019s office has been contacted for a response to Wolf\u2019s claims. It is not the first time an Australian federal minister has sparred with a US celebrity. In 2017 the then deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, made international headlines after he threatened to have Johnny Depp\u2019s dogs put down when the actor bypassed customs to bring them into the country. Pistol and Boo were flown home before Joyce\u2019s deadline. In June, Wolf\u2019s latest book release was cancelled in the US and future versions corrected in the UK after she admitted live on air that it contained at least two errors. In an interview on BBC Radio 3, broadcaster Matthew Sweet pointed out that Wolf had misunderstood the historical term \u201cdeath recorded\u201d while writing her book Outrages. While Wolf believed it meant an execution, Sweet said it was a term that allowed judges to record a death without carrying out an execution. Wolf has said she was thankful for the correction, that it only affected two pages and did not affect the thesis of the book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
