The creative economy \u2013 contributing between 10% and 14% of GNP \u2013 is underwritten, fed and enabled by the vibrant arts economy created and described by those who wrote the letter. It is difficult to imagine how the coalition will attempt to justify making cuts that imperil the growth of the fastest-growing section of our economy. The hope and expectation will be that the Treasury \u2013 the guardian of the wellbeing of our economy \u2013 will intervene. If a fault line were to develop between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, it may well be over this issue. My guess would be that Liberals and Labour will be at one in recognising the absolute stupidity of cuts that damage this part of our economy. Lord Matthew Evans London \u2022 I am writing in support of the artists warning of cuts in the arts. Last week, Cergam, a research unit at the University Paul-C\u00e9zanne in Aix-en-Provence, announced that the 2009 Picasso exhibition and related programme of activities earned \u20ac62m of additional income for the town. The principal beneficiaries were local restaurants as well as the hotels, which recorded up to 30,000 additional nights. In addition, 227 full-time jobs were created. And the investment? Just \u20ac6m. The government should look to the long-term financial benefits of spending in the arts.
