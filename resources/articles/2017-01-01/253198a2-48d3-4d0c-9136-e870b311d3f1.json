That question sums up this series so far: sometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out exactly where The Halcyon is pitched. I don\u2019t really care, though. Because of the ambition of the thing and the sheer, breathtaking elegance of it, I am loving it \u2013 and with only occasional reservations. There are moments where I like to think it\u2019s tongue-in-cheek, almost like Woody Allen\u2019s Bullets Over Broadway. At other times it\u2019s more like a straight, quality drama. And sometimes it crosses over into self-parody. Still, it\u2019s only episode two. It has time to steady itself. Series creator Charlotte Jones is intriguing. She\u2019s a playwright with a massive list of theatre credits whose last TV creation was the 2011 mini-series Without You. ITV has also pulled in directors who have worked on Harry Potter and Mr Selfridge. They\u2019re not messing about. And it can\u2019t be a coincidence that costume designer Anna Robbins (doing a fabulous job here) worked on two series of Downton Abbey. What matters, though, is whether we fall in love with the characters. We went straight to the heart of things as her Ladyship attempted to oust Mr Garland. Freddy: \u201cI\u2019ve been instructed to let you go.\u201d Oh dear me, no. Mr Garland is the best thing about this whole series. Don\u2019t let him go. There\u2019ll be nothing left \u2013 unless he gets a job at a rival hotel... But no. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a job for you here. She\u2019s aristocracy. You\u2019re management.\u201d There is so much riding on Mr Garland and her Ladyship. Without these two performances, this whole thing could sink. Luckily Steven Mackintosh and Olivia Williams are well cast and have a brilliant, understated chemistry. The penultimate scene with his grieving speech was excellent. Clearly there\u2019s history here. Or if there isn\u2019t, the actors have the good sense to play it as if there is. As Freddy says of his father and Mr Garland: \u201cI don\u2019t know what secrets he had on you.\u201d This has been hinted at a few times, and will surely will be the key. I was surprised, though, to learn that Mr Garland has only been working at the hotel for \u201cnearly 10 years.\u201d He behaves as if he was born there. Which is why I wasn\u2019t sure about the idea of him moving in with the badger. This compromises his status; he\u2019s the hotel manager, not a doorman. He\u2019s virtually family. And I wasn\u2019t sure he would be a drinker and a gambler either, even if he is a world war one survivor. Or that one of his staff would follow him to the casino to spell out just at the right moment that he shouldn\u2019t risk it all. But never mind; it\u2019s all part of the bedding in. Hopefully soon we will be done with the melodrama and the semaphoring. Have they thrown away the \u201ctension between the brothers\u201d plot line too early? Possibly. Do we want to see more of Betsy (Kara Tointon)? Probably. Do we want a special plot line for the Unfeasibly Large Dog? Of course we do! In other news, I loved the bit with the wobbly teapot and the olden days bus with the \u201cWrigley\u2019s\u201d advert on it. Diamante brooch for best supporting costume It\u2019s tempting to award the brooch to Kara Tointon (Betsy) again because her look steals every scene. Her Ladyship\u2019s mourning weeds were also wonderful. And her Bloomsbury blouse game? Fierce. As for the costumes in the Cafe de Paris scene \u2013 extraordinary. But the brooch must go to this episode\u2019s obvious winner: Beverley Knight, guest-starring as the Cafe de Paris singer Ruby. That dress! Oscar-worthy. Inevitable Downton Abbey flashback moment This is the part where we look at anachronisms, inconsistencies and unlikelihoods \u2013 the hallmarks of the all-conquering Downton brand. \u201cGot my eye on you, Fritz ...\u201d \u201cI was going to invite you to the Cafe de Paris, chef. But with that attitude ...\u201d Betsy attempts some Remoaniac sympathising in solidarity with Refugee Kitchen Man. But would anyone really be bothered about a bit of casual German bashing in May 1940? Doubtful. I am also trying not to overanalyse the relationship between Freddy (the new Lord Hamilton) and Emma, presented here as a post-feminist icon. Would they really be allowed to be so close without his mother intervening? And would someone in the family not stand in the way of a young woman being made Assistant Manager of the hotel, especially when she\u2019s the daughter of the Manager? As I say, best not to overanalyse... Show-stopping lines \u201cI need you for once in your life to be a bloody son to me.\u201d \u201cA madam knows how to run a brothel. It\u2019s not something to be proud of.\u201d \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been dictated to by men. Why should my son be any different?\u201d Her Ladyship\u2019s zingers don\u2019t come close to Cousin Violet\u2019s in Downton, but she plays the bitch a treat. More Elizabeth Taylor-style nostril-flaring, please. \u201cToday is not the day to test me.\u201d Mr Garland displays his hidden shallows \u2013 and an unexpectedly hot temper. He is not the mild-mannered hotel manager he seems. \u201cI escaped Austria to run from one angry little man. I\u2019m not running from another.\u201d I love Refugee Kitchen Man."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
