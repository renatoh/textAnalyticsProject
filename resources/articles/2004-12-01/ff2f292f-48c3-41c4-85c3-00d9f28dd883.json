So, what is the everyday reality of this all-too-common dream? Chris, who has four children - two grown up, two still at home - has adapted her large family cottage in the Yorkshire Dales with her husband Peter. Far End Farm, now with three guest bedrooms, officially opened for business six weeks ago. 'I am excited,' says Chris, 50. 'But I am also realistic. I know it will take a while to get established and when I do it will be hard work. But I'm ready for that. And I think I'll enjoy it.' This balanced approach is all too rare. 'Too many people see running a B&amp;B as an easy, inexpensive, attractive option,' says John Fletcher of the Centre for Tourism and Hospitality Research. 'They see romance and rewards where in fact there is a lot of effort and expense.' Cathy Colam confirms this. With her partner she runs Cumbria House, an eight-bedroom B&amp;B in the Lake District. In terms of the workload, Cathy says: 'This is an enjoyable business, but it is also a lifestyle business. Anyone who makes a success of it is effectively on call almost all the time.' As for investment and returns: 'There may be considerable outlay and it may take some time for you to recoup your costs and make a profit.' Working out the actual figures involved is not straightforward. Maggie Dobson, chair of the Bed and Breakfast and Guest House Association, explains: 'How much you can expect to pay to start your own B&amp;B, or to buy an existing one, and to then predict what you can expect to earn from it, is actually quite difficult. It all depends on the nature of the property and how it is managed.' Cash has managed to come up with some estimations, albeit rough ones. Most experts told us that converting an existing home is likely to be more expensive (and more difficult) than people imagine. In addition to the cost of renovating and refurbishing rooms, and possibly adding an en-suite or three, there is the cost of meeting numerous industry standards. B&amp;Bs must be registered, and to register they must adhere to a raft of sometimes strict requirements. These range from planning permission and building regulation to fire and food safety. All this can easily add up to several thousand pounds, says Alastair Murchie of specialist valuer Colliers Robert Barry. Those in the know acknowledge that the alternative, purchasing a fully fledged operation, requires really serious capital. Daltonsbusiness.com, a site that lists businesses for sale, gives some indication of the numbers involved. A 'character' property with seven bedrooms in a coastal town in Cornwall costs \u00a3500,000. A listed semi-detached property with four bedrooms in greater London costs even more. A 16th-century property with five bedrooms in an Essex port town costs almost \u00a3700,000. 'It's big bucks,' says Hugh Caven of specialist IFA Walbrook Commercial Finance. Once you either take over or start up a B&amp;B there are further expenses to account for - and they will be ongoing. The property will need upkeep for one thing, and marketing for another. It may also be necessary to take on staff, if only from time to time. As Helen Jackman points out in her guide, Just Six Guests, this can quickly run into several thousand pounds, which does eat into your bottom line. The best we can say about the bottom line is that it varies enormously. Some B&amp;Bs claim they are full most of the time. Others, by choice or otherwise, indicate that they are empty half the time. The latest survey on room occupancy in serviced accommodation in the UK is telling: in 2003 it was found to be 58 per cent, apparently the highest figure since the mid-1990s. Despite the complexities involved in running a B&amp;B - clearly it's not as simple as many of us (like to) think - those who do it, seem to love it. Cooper at Far End Farm says: 'If you enjoy meeting people and making them feel warm and welcome, you can get huge amounts of pleasure out of it.' Colam at Cumbria House agrees: 'It can be a wonderful way to earn a living. It may not be a huge living, but if you do it well, it can be a comfortable living.' Ahhh... with comments like that it's no wonder so many of us do dream of opening a little place up. Maybe somewhere by the sea. Or up in the hills. Perhaps right in the cosmopolitan centre of things would be better..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
