Gone are the days of the direct flight that whisked oil workers to the Alaskan pipeline. But when you eventually reach Anchorage, the draining hours of travel quickly dissipate as a landscape filled with craggy glaciers and mountain ranges stretches forever into the distance. Even at night, the outline of the Chugach mountains is an impressive sight as they rise from the sea. Alaska is rugged, dazzlingly beautiful and somewhat quirky. The last hour of our journey was made enjoyable by our mode of transport, the Magic Bus, which is a travelling party machine that can transform from a low-lit lounge with deep comfy sofas in to a full-on disco, all in the space of the 70km transfer to Alyeska, Alaska's only official ski resort near the small town of Girdwood. Even with today's booming property prices, it is hard to believe that Alaska was bought by the US secretary of state William H Seward from Russia in 1867 for just $7.2m, roughly two cents an acre. At the time, most people thought it a lot to pay for an empty wilderness. Today, the population is still only 622,000, and it retains the spirit of adventure and exploration. It is not much more than 100 years since the gold rush; and before that it was a land of fur trapping and trading. Moose still roam free in Anchorage, its largest city, while lynx and wolves patrol the forests. In summer, the waters are home to giant Alaskan crabs, wild salmon, whales and otters. But the conditions are not as extreme as you might expect. In late February/early March, you have around 11 hours of daylight with average temperatures between -3C and 1C. The ski resort doesn't open until 10.30am, the last lifts closing at 5.30pm - perfect for an early start to apr\u00e8s-ski. On the piste map, the resort looks small and manageable, with 68 runs, one tram and six chairlifts. The summit is 1,200m, the drop 760m. But the summit of Mount Alyeska receives an average of 14m of snow a year, which makes for a lot of powder skiing. When we arrived, the resort had had 2.8m of snow in two weeks, and we skied powder all day. The conditions weren't unusual and, if you look at the selection of rental skis on offer, there are far more geared to powder than piste carving. The weather isn't perfect - there's a lot of cloud and moisture - because you are at sea level, and the area is subject to micro climates. \"It's not unusual to have the equivalent of four seasons in a day,\" our guide, Chris, told us, \"but the snow packs down so the chutes and high stuff hold the snow.\" The chutes are what turns the entire north face of the mountain into some of the most challenging runs within any ski area boundary in the world. These are steep, double-black diamonds with something for every standard: if you want a 45-degree slope in a couloir, it's there; if you prefer to traverse out of the steep bit to a wider open pitch, that's there too. And all are accessed from the tram. Valdez, home of the World Extreme Skiing Championships, is only 20 minutes away by helicopter. But Valdez is just the tip of the iceberg, said one of my companions, Mike. \"Ten years ago, a heli-drop in Valdez cost $35, and that would be a good four-hour descent. You'd get a ride, and then a bus would come around and pick people up from the road. But Valdez has been discovered, so now you have to go further away to get a few mountains to yourself.\" Our first run took us to Christmas chute on the north face - steep, knee-deep powder. But intermediates need not be intimidated because the ski area covers runs at all levels, with those such as Sourdough, Klondike and Ego Flats offering a variety of blue runs. That first day found us in the early evening on a long, cruisey run, mesmerised by the view. We had to stop and watch as the daylight faded around us, the clouds turning pink in the sunset. In many ways, passionate skiers will always find themselves in a quandary on a trip like this - there is simply so much to do that you could not do anywhere else. It would be a shame to miss getting airborne and seeing from above the towering glaciers where blocks of turquoise ice tumble into the sea, or taking a cruise to spot whales, porpoise, sea lions and sea otters. Or you might want to try your hand at mushing. Anchorage is the starting point for the annual Iditarod dogsled race - an 1,868km epic across the state. Then there is the apr\u00e8s-ski, which can be as raucous or as civilised as you wish. One night, we ate burgers and pizza at Max's, in the small town of Girdwood, amid a sea of lumberjack shirts and beanies; another night, it was a Japanese extravaganza at the Alyeska Prince Hotel's Katsura Teppanyaki restaurant. An excursion to Anchorage, again via the Magic Bus, led us to The Glacier Brewhouse where local beer complements Alaskan crab. For even greater drinking choice, we headed to Humpy's to taste all 43 Alaskan beers. Then it was on to Chilcoot Charlie's with its nine bars and three dancefloors. Needless to say, the night was long, but just before I fell into the deepest of sleeps I remembered one of the hotel's special features. Not only is there an electronic display of the aurora borealis on the ceiling of the lobby, but it also has a wake-up service if you wish to see the real thing.
