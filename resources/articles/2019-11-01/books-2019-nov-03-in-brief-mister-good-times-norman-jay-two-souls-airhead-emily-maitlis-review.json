His memoir is full of the heart and spirit he brings to his music, but it also offers a salutary account of growing up as part of the Windrush generation in London\u2019s Notting Hill, the violence and racism he faced, and his success. This book, to use his phrase, has its own \u201crare groove\u201d. Two Souls Henry McDonald Merrion Press, 272pp, \u00a314.99 At a time when questions of Irish unionism are to the fore again, Henry McDonald\u2019s tough, unsentimental new novel reminds us of the human cost of the Troubles. It focuses on Robbie McManus, a bright young man surrounded by the trigger-happy and the unstable, and his struggles to extricate himself from late-70s Belfast against a backdrop of punk and Bowie\u2019s Low. McDonald\u2019s background in nonfiction (he also writes for the Guardian and Observer) gives this a gripping verisimilitude, and there\u2019s an energy to his prose that makes Two Souls an exhilarating read, even as the events depicted spiral into inevitable violence. Airhead Emily Maitlis Penguin, 384pp, \u00a39.99 (paperback) Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis is one of the savviest journalists working today, so her part-memoir, part-political commentary is titled with tongue-in-cheek irony. She recounts the interviews of her career, from the great (the Dalai Lama, Bill Clinton), the good (David Attenborough) and the more questionable (Donald Trump, Steve Bannon), offering first-hand insights into the questions that illuminated their characters and the ones they, or she, dodged. A chapter on being the target of a stalker reveals her more vulnerable side in this compelling book. \u2022 To order Mister Good Times, Two Souls or Airhead, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
