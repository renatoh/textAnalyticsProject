Players ordinarily need to have registered here by the deadline of 5pm on Tuesday local time. However, the PGA of America issued a statement on Tuesday evening saying that competitors can extend that deadline to their Thursday tee-time if notice is given. Woods has provided such notice. Question marks hover around the future of Woods following his withdrawal from the WGC Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday with the recurrence of a back problem. Injuries have proved an increasing hindrance to him; he missed the Masters after back surgery. Woods has therefore been a notable absentee from the early stages of the week here, having cancelled his planned Tuesday press conference and his appearance at the tournament\u2019s champions\u2019 dinner. Confirmation of whether Woods will appear at the season\u2019s final major is expected on Wednesday, although he could wait until his 8.35 tee-off time the following morning. His caddie, Joe LaCava, said on Tuesday that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d over the former world No1\u2019s participation, although his level of insight into Woods\u2019 condition was unclear. Martin Kaymer, the US Open champion, has conceded the buzz of winning tournaments is still intensified when Woods is among the opposition. \u201cObviously everybody wants him to be back at the golf tournaments,\u201d said Kaymer of Woods. \u201cIf you win a big tournament without Tiger in the field, you still feel very happy about it but you want to play against him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice if he\u2019s part of every tournament; he brings a lot of people into it. It has a different flair. And obviously here everybody knows as well, when Tiger\u2019s playing in a golf tournament there\u2019s more work for you guys [the media] as well; more entertainment and more people. It brings a little bit more to a golf tournament. \u201cIf I had injuries like this, I would probably make really, really sure that I\u2019m healthy, because he\u2019s 38 years old; so hopefully he will have another 10, 15 years of competing against the guys on the PGA Tour.\u201d Adam Scott will, like Kaymer, seek to add to his major success over the coming days at Valhalla. Scott has stressed the value of specialised training. \u201cInjury prevention is a huge thing,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously the golf swing is stressful on the body, especially at a high level and with high repetitions like we put in. \u201cEarlier in my career, the foundations of my training were probably based around injury prevention. As I\u2019ve matured or evolved as a golfer and with my body, I\u2019ve had to adjust and adapt and try and strengthen areas that weaken just through this repetition of beating golf balls.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
