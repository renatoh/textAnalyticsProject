But they need to be helped and supported, not goaded and ultimately forced to return to work before they are ready to do so. Simply causing them further financial worries is not going to help them. And the government needs to involve employers in the process - they have a vital role in ensuring this is successful. Sophie Corlett, director of policy at the mental health charity Mind The plans will give hope to hundreds of thousands of people who want to work but need specialist support to do so. But they will also strike fear into people struggling to survive on benefits who will fear that financial support is going to be withdrawn. There are a handful of excellent employers who recognise the value of employing people who have mental health problems - but mental health discrimination is widespread in the workplace. These plans would be greatly strengthened by government action to end labour market discrimination by employers. The government has announced a package that will go a little way to addressing some of these barriers, but it is only half the story. Cliff Prior, chief executive of the mental health charity Rethink With 30,000 jobs being lost from the Department of Work and Pensions, it is hard to see how it will be possible to sustain the level of advice, training and support that many people with disabilities and long-term illnesses will need in order to get back into work. Robust safeguards will be needed to make sure that very vulnerable disabled people - for example some people with cancer or mental health problems - are not faced with completely unreasonable demands and then penalised for failing to co-operate. John Wheatley, senior policy officer at Citizens Advice Cancer patients undergoing treatment or with a terminal diagnosis should not be called to attend work-focused interviews. The government needs to improve safeguards to prevent cancer patients or those with a terminal illness being inappropriately required to attend interviews. The onus now needs to be on employers to develop job retention and return to work packages that help cancer patients return to work when they are able to. Peter Cardy, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Relief Incapacity benefit is desperately in need of reform and the government is right to tackle it. These reforms must pave the way for a simplified benefits system which effectively supports people back into work and provides a decent income for those times when work is not possible due to sickness or disability. The key to success will be a system that provides tailored packages of support designed to meet individuals' needs. Kate Stanley, head of social policy at the Institute of Public Policy Research If there were to be a package that involved cutting benefits then people like myself would simply vote against them. I think, however, we have seen in recent years a conscious shift towards very progressive policies of helping and supporting disabled people back to work; there has been a change in mind and a change in policy. Roger Berry, one of 45 Labour MPs who rebelled against benefit reforms in 1999 The reforms are a vital part of the response to demographic change and increased life expectancy as 50% of the 2.7 million on incapacity benefit are over 50. We can no longer use IB as a surrogate form of early retirement. However, their success is dependent on quality of delivery. Too many well-intentioned reforms - such as tax credits, child support, the skills strategy - have been let down by operational problems. Great effort is going to be needed to overcome barriers in the work place to taking on older people who have been on benefits. Employer preconceptions about both disability and age are deep rooted. One million new jobs will require a million examples putting these stereotypes on one side. Patrick Grattan, chief executive of the Third Age Employment Network The Liberal Democrats want to see reforms that provide a high level of individual tailored support so that the thousands of disabled people who want to get back to work can. The government must avoid the temptation to grab easy headlines and ensure that reforms are sustainable and constructive. Danny Alexander MP, Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman We hope that the new reforms will incentivise disabled people to attend regular support interviews, as they will come to represent a key opportunity to discuss their options and consider ways to ensure their needs are met to assist them back into work. If these new reforms are successful, there should be no need to sanction disabled people for non-attendance. Disabled people want to work. The government must avoid a two-tier approach to providing support for disabled people looking for work. No one should be excluded from the opportunity to receive support and advice about accessing the world of work. Old-fashioned medical distinctions about who \"can\" and \"cannot\" work no longer have any place in our society. No one should be labeled as \"unemployable\". All disabled people have a contribution to make to society whether it be through full-time, part-time, paid or voluntary work. Kate Nash, chief executive of the disability charity Radar Small businesses need willing workers, particularly in sectors like tourism, hospitality and manufacturing. Going back to work can give people a sense of purpose and social interaction, which is just not there if you are off on sick leave. People coming off incapacity benefit must accept that having the right attitude is all-important from the moment they walk in for the interview. But small business owners cannot carry passengers. They will be cautious and suspicious that people who have been on long-term sick will have fallen into bad habits.
