The National Farmers Union has formally complained to National Trading Standards over the use of fictitious brands that it claims could mislead consumers. It cites Tesco\u2019s \u201cWoodside Farms\u201d and \u201cBoswell Farms\u201d as examples of brands which it claims could make consumers believe they are buying produce farmed in the UK. Tesco\u2019s pork products branded under the Woodside logo have been shown to come from countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark. Some beef products sold under the Boswell brand have come from Ireland. \u201cThe NFU\u2019s legal team has looked at this carefully and as a result we are asking National Trading Standards to look at whether \u2018fake\u2019 farm branding complies with the relevant legal requirements,\u201d said Meurig Raymond, the NFU president. \u201cI have spoken to senior management at Tesco to highlight our members\u2019 concerns about the use of these fake farm brands. I urge all retailers to consider seriously the results of our survey which show that mixing imported produce with British produce under the same fictional farm name can be misleading to many of their customers. I am pleased that Aldi has now made a commitment to only source British produce in their fictional farm brands by the end of March 2017.\u201d Stephen James, president of the NFU in Wales, described fake farm brands as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cThis practice has been going on across the retail sector for a long time and enough is enough,\u201d he said. A YouGov survey commissioned by the NFU found that three in five people who said they believed such products were \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d British admitted that they would feel misled if they were informed that the product came from a country outside the UK. \u201cCountry of origin labelling is important because we know from consumer surveys that shoppers want to buy British food products,\u201d James said. \u201cClearly, consumers cannot exercise that choice without clear country of origin labelling. That\u2019s why we have now written to trading standards to argue our point and to ask for clear guidelines for retailers on the clarity of country of origin labelling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
