The first was here at Wimbledon when Venus Williams skipped across the centre court grass, and her father, Richard, soft-shoe shuffled on top of the television commentary box. Then, at Flushing Meadows, father and daughter danced together just a few feet from Davenport, slumped in her chair, as she desperately tried to come to terms with her second successive grand slam defeat at the hands of Venus. The memories remain vivid and raw. Defeat was bad enough for the 25-year-old Californian, but there is little doubt that her misery was compounded by the overt exuberance of the celebrations, most notably in New York. Victory today in the semi-finals would do much to erase those images and Davenport's belief in her own ability to beat Venus has been increasing steadily throughout the championships. \"I've played through to the semis, and now it's time to play even better,\" she said. In their first nine meetings, dating back to 1997, Davenport won eight times. But since 1999 Williams has turned mat ters around almost completely, winning five out of seven, including last year's grand slam finals, both in straight sets. Davenport's moment of consolation came late last year when she won their last encounter in the Linz tournament final, thereby bringing to an end a run of 35 consecutive victories for Venus. But this has not been an easy year for Davenport. She lost in the semi-finals of this year's Australian Open to Jennifer Capriati, and then injured her knee during the Ericsson Open at Key Biscayne in March. She had intended returning for the clay-court season, but the knee continued to trouble her, while a serious illness to her former doubles partner, Corina Morariu, caused her to further assess her own life within tennis. Prior to this year's French Open Davenport had not missed a grand slam in eight years. \"I definitely cried when I had to pull out of the French,\" she said. \"A week later I was thinking: 'That's ridiculous.' It was a life lesson.\" Davenport accepts that she will be the underdog against Venus and is relishing the prospect, knowing that the pressure will be on the reigning champion and world No2. Williams, having lost in the first round of the French Open, and having previously played only two tournaments on clay this season, has played little more than Davenport since the Ericsson Open. While, like Davenport, she has not dropped a set at Wimbledon this year she has not been totally convincing, although she has not been stretched. Justine Henin, a semi-finalist at the French Open, could barely have had a more straightforward quarter-final win, defeating Spain's Conchita Martinez 6-1, 6-0, but she has had tough matches against Anke Huber and Kristie Boogert and admits to feeling a little tired ahead of her semi-final against Capriati. The centre court crowd will certainly be on Capriati's side, urging her ever onwards towards her first Wimbledon title, and the third stage of a calendar grand slam, last achieved by Steffi Graf in 1988. The two have met only once, in this year's German Open semi-final, when Henin was forced to withdraw, having twisted her ankle, with Capriati leading 6-2, 4-6, 2-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
