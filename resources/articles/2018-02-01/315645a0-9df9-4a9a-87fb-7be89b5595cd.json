I\u2019d played nearly 250 games of rugby league and been concussed over a dozen times. I wasn\u2019t getting out without a scratch. But \u201cirreversible long-term brain damage\u201d? It hit me right in the guts. For this is what happens when you\u2019re concussed. Your brain is damaged. It is what it is. And it\u2019s the language we have to use when talking about concussion. Fact: every time you\u2019re concussed your brain is damaged. And it\u2019s irreversible. And you need to know that, to hear it. We must have this conversation. Yes, for sure, when a doctor uses so emotive a term as brain damage \u2013 or one so medical-sterile as chronic traumatic encephalopathy \u2013 there\u2019s a mix of shock and fear that hits you all at once. It\u2019s almost a form of grief \u2013 for yourself. But it\u2019s hard to sugar-coat \u201cirreversible scarring on the brain\u201d. It is what it is is. And as a sport, as a country, we need to have the conversation. I first noticed my memory playing up while living in Los Angeles. I\u2019d spent seven years there as one of the lucky few \u2013 a working actor. And I\u2019d never had problems with auditions \u2013 getting a page of script and getting my lines, I\u2019d always been confident. But five or six years ago I noticed that dialogue just wasn\u2019t going in. I was feeling uncomfortable in auditions. I wasn\u2019t sharp, confident. I knew something was up. Now, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a moment of realisation. People ask: \u201cWhen do you remember forgetting stuff.\u201d How can you answer that? I just knew I wasn\u2019t confident in auditions. Forgetting lines was something I\u2019d never worried about. For a number of reasons, not just my memory, I came back to Sydney three years ago and bumped into Alan Pearce, a professor at La Trobe University and expert in the neurophysiology of sports-related concussion. He was getting a research study together and asked if I\u2019d be one of 25 ex-league players who\u2019d been out of the game for 15-20 years. There would also be a control group of 25 men in the same age bracket who hadn\u2019t played contact sport. And so we were all given a series of tests and tasks, and scanning of the brain. And in all categories of the study the ex-players fared considerably worse. There was one test where you\u2019d take a bunch of different-coloured pegs and plug them into holes in a block of wood. Thirty seconds later you\u2019d take the pegs out and try to plug them back into the same holes. The ex-players came out far worse than the control group. Some of the other footballers, like myself, have a profile. But they\u2019re not willing to go public. And I totally get that. Yet I believe this conversation needs to be had. Players, administrators, parents, kids, everyone in rugby league \u2013 in sport \u2013 needs to be informed about the long-term affects of repetitive concussion. And we need to call it what it is: brain damage. Yes, the term is confronting. It\u2019s emotive. It\u2019s what happens to people in car accidents, right? Thus it\u2019s a word that resonates. It\u2019s also fact. When you suffer a concussion you suffer brain damage. Calling it head trauma or a head knock, it\u2019s like you\u2019re cushioning the blow, so to speak. But every time you sustain a concussion it\u2019s damage to the brain. It\u2019s brain damage. The National Rugby League and other sporting bodies need to move forward with strategies for prevention. The NRL is making the right noises, and taking small steps. They\u2019re educating themselves. They\u2019re listening to experts. They acknowledge there\u2019s an issue. The data is in: repeated concussion causes long term brain damage. Parents and kids need to know. The media needs to ask current players are they are aware of these things. Are today\u2019s players enacting preventative measures? Have they read the test results of their peers in the previous generations? What are the clubs doing? What is the Rugby League Players Association, the union, doing? Health and safety is paramount. It\u2019s duty of care. It\u2019s about the quality of people\u2019s lives. I do some work for the NRL in a theatre sports program. We go around to clubs and talk about awkward issues: misogyny, depression, suicide, drug use, social media. The league is on the front foot. It\u2019s progressive. And now we need to incorporate brain damage into the conversation. We have to talk about it. We can\u2019t ignore it. And the players, like all of us, have to take responsibility for their own health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
