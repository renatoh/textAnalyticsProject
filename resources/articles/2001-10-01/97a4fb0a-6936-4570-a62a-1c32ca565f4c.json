Many Londoners are questioning whether the public private partnership (PPP) for the tube will require its own government bailout. Unfortunately, the government seems intent on pressing ahead with its fundamentally flawed PPP proposals, even though this PPP replicates the mistakes made with the privatisation of national rail - precisely the mistakes the government now seeks to remedy with the creation of a public interest trust in place of Railtrack. Virtually all industry experts and observers agree the way national rail was privatised led to its problems, including the collapse of Railtrack. A single entity was broken into dozens of different companies, contractors and subcontractors who failed to communicate and collaborate effectively due to a massively complex contractual regime. The industry's fragmented structure separated the running of trains from track maintenance. Under PPP, the tube will be broken up among three private sector consortia, or infracos, in charge of maintenance and investment, yet Transport for London (TfL) will continue to run the trains and staff the stations. This recreates the split of wheel from steel so criticised on the privatised national rail network. Instead of a unified management structure, the underground will be managed using the incredibly complex PPP contracts, over 135 separate documents. The government forced Railtrack's collapse by decid ing not to advance a further \u00a32bn of taxpayers' cash, but not before Railtrack had swallowed up an extra \u00a31.5bn in government subsidy in May. Railtrack used \u00a3140m of this to pay shareholder dividends, despite making a \u00a3500m loss this year. Under PPP, the public get an even worse deal. Despite the government originally claiming PPP would remove the need for public subsidy of the tube, it is now clear that upwards of \u00a31bn a year will be paid to the infracos. The government repeatedly says that \u00a313bn will be invested over the first 15 years of the 30-year PPP, but the underground's own analysis shows that just 55%, or \u00a37.15bn, of that will actually be spent on maintaining and improving the tube's infrastructure. The rest goes to the infracos and their shareholders' pockets. Safety is a key concern: in recent years we have seen three major rail disasters - at Southall, Ladbroke Grove and Hatfield - and the number of trains going through red lights rises still. The official accident report on Ladbroke Grove concluded that the fragmentation of the rail network meant it was more difficult for train operating companies and Railtrack to develop a common safety regime and to learn from each other's mistakes. Even more devastating, it was the split of wheel from steel which led to Hatfield. Although Railtrack and its contractors knew the rail was cracked in February 2000, they did not close or replace it - for fear of incurring fines - before the disaster occurred six months later. Under PPP, the wheel from steel split is repeated. The reality is TfL will have to rely upon information provided by the infracos themselves to judge whether the tube tracks are safe. So what is the alterna-tive? Ironically, it bears some similarity to what we know of the new public interest trust proposed to replace Railtrack. The London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), which became London Transport (LT), although essentially a private concern, was operated as a not-for-profit trust (sound familiar?) and could raise private money. During its 1930s heyday, LPTB was unrivalled in both the investment in and management of metropolitan public transport. However, after the second world war nationalisation of LPTB robbed it of the ability to raise money and it became entirely dependent on an annual government grant. As funding became unpre-dictable, the underground spiralled downward. Initially, this government made a good start to addressing the tube's problems. It recognised that to service a great modern city, London's entire transport network had to be integrated once more and brought under regional democratic control. Devolution to the elected mayor and GLA has given the capital the opportunity to shape its transport future. But TfL is still dependent on central government funding, unable to raise its own finance as LPTB once was. This is untenable. It is time the government recognised the devolution agenda must be completed if we are to make a real difference to transport in London. It is ironic the government is pledging a Railtrack Mark II for London Underground, while introducing a system similar to that which I am proposing for the tube to replace Railtrack. The government must recognise the fundamental flaws inherent in this PPP and, in accordance with the wishes of Londoners, hand TfL the power to raise the necessary investment, and provide for unified management. Only then can we think about returning the tube to its former glory. \u00b7 Bob Kiley is commissioner of transport for London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
