All three works were composed between the two world wars, and all were delivered with the crisp authority that is the hallmark of Salonen's performances. Even in its suite form, Bart\u00f3k's The Miraculous Mandarin makes a wonderful concert opener, and a brilliant showcase for an orchestra keen to show its mettle to its new boss. Salonen propelled the violins into the urban bustle of the opening with great fervour, later matched by the remorseless intensity of the chase at the end of the suite. Other conductors (Andris Nelsons last week with the CBSO, for instance) inject more sensuous detail into the woodwind tendrils of the seduction scenes, but Salonen's cooler precision carries its own allure. There was a sense of detachment about the performance of Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto too, especially in Vadim Repin's immaculate solo playing, which never missed a detail but ultimately seemed too contained, even in the unbuttoned, Spanish-inflected finale. But Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex is all about emotional detachment, about containing terrible events within the strictly organised hybrid form of opera-oratorio and Salonen managed that magnificently. Simon Russell Beale was the narrator, delivering EE Cummings's ageless English translation with perfect tact, while Stephen Gould sang Oedipus with intensity, Ekaterina Gubanova handled Jocasta's climactic aria with tragic aplomb and Kyle Ketelsen, Andrew Kennedy and Franz-Josef Selig were equally incisive in the smaller roles. The Philharmonia Voices supplied the choral backdrop, while Salonen balanced all the components, and the orchestral commentary, with implacable theatricality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
