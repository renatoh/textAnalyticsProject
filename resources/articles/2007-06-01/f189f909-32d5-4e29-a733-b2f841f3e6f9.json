The Scandinavian travel group, SAS, said it would sell its stakes in three carriers, including a shareholding in BMI. The British company is coveted for its 12% share of take off and landing slots at Heathrow, which could provide a gateway to the transatlantic market when Europe-to-US air travel is liberalised next year. BMI is controlled by Sir Michael Bishop, who owns 50% plus one share. He has a veto over the SAS stake, which cannot be sold to a competitor without his permission. Another possible buyer is Germany's Lufthansa, which owns 30% minus one share of BMI. The SAS move could accelerate a looming decision that Sir Michael has to make over his shareholding. The BMI chairman has until June 2009 to exercise a put option to sell his stake, valued at \u00a3229m when Lufthansa struck the deal eight years ago; it in turn has a call option to buy the stake from December 2008 to June 2009. Other potential buyers of the SAS stake include British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Virgin has attempted to merge with BMI in recent years, while BA has been cited as a possible buyer because taking over BMI would protect its position at Heathrow, where it is the largest carrier. Last month, Sir Michael played down speculation that BMI will be acquired any time soon. BMI declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
