Their bonus system \u2013 which over the years has become akin to a system of salary supplements \u2013 survives and prospers. The Deloitte study, regarded as the statistical bible on big-boardroom rewards, reveals that the median bonus payment for executives was 75% of the maximum last year. True, that's down from 85% a year ago, but it still meant that actual bonus payouts equated to 120% of salary in FTSE 100 companies. What a strange world it is where the overwhelming majority of directors are deemed to be doing such an exceptional job that they deserve their salary again as a bonus. When too many students get top marks, \"grade inflation\" is deemed a scandal and the education secretary intervenes. In the world of big companies, a few non-executive directors confess in private that annual bonuses should be chopped in favour of long-term rewards. But reform doesn't happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
