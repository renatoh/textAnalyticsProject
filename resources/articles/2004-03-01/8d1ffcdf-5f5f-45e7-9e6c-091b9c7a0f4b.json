Four weeks before the tournament they were wrapping up their preparations with a win over Scotland when disaster struck - their flying wing Geordan Murphy was stretchered off with a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula, both the bones of the calf. Ireland had three players behind the scrum with the pace and the footwork to spread panic in opposing defences and even before kick-off that was down to two. Their number was subsequently reduced to one when Denis Hickie was injured against Australia. By the time this year's Six Nations started the third pacy player, Brian O'Driscoll, was in rehab after a hamstring injury. Easy to understand, then, why Ireland's coach Eddie O'Sullivan was bracing himself for an anxious campaign during which mid-table would be both safe and desirable. The picture is rather brighter and better now. On the immediate horizon is the prospect of a seventh triple crown in Ireland's modest history; beyond that is a two-match tour to South Africa in June. With a fit squad Ireland would be confident of confirming their International Rugby Board ranking of world No5 by beating the Springboks as all three fast men should be back in business by then. Murphy's importance in the Irish set-up is highlighted by the swiftness of his return. It is far removed from the days when Leicester officials would express bewilderment that a player so valued by his club was considered surplus by his country. That is all in the past, and last season he finally nailed down a starting spot in the side. All he had to do over the last few weeks was prove that he could put one foot in front of the other and he would be recalled on the wing for today's visit of Italy to Lansdowne Road. \"I was a bit surprised, I suppose,\" he said of his recall. \"I mean, I'm a confidence player. Once I got back playing for Leicester, over the last three games I think I've improved. The game I played last week against Northampton, as far as I'm concerned, I played as well as I was before I broke my leg. \"So I told Eddie O'Sullivan at the start of the week, and he said to me 'Are you all right?'. That was a fair question to ask. I had to be honest with myself and I told him I thought I was all right to play. Whatever happens, I'd do whatever to get a spot.\" Evidently he did not have to do too much, yet he is content that his limited amount of game time since his return has been enough. \"The first game against London Irish was a physical encounter and I was able to get back up to speed,\" he says. \"The Barbarians game got me a lot of handling and running lines again and after that it was Northampton which was a tough local derby.\" It is becoming typical of top-level rugby players that they need little time to find their feet again in the international game. Last month O'Driscoll got off the treatment table after six weeks out with a hamstring tear and went on to play against Wales. He ended up with two tries. The rush back to action however tells us something of O'Sullivan's eagerness to get his ducks in a row, as he likes to put it. When he was assistant to Warren Gatland he made an immediate impression on the quality of Ireland's back play, a feature harder to spot when he assumed control himself. With the emergence of the centre Gordon D'Arcy and the gradual return of his shoo-in selections, the coach can get back to the point where Ireland's backs mean business. Up front today he is going to have to do without the second-row Paul O'Connell after the Munster lock failed to recover from a rib injury he picked up against England. Donncha O'Callaghan will move off the bench to plug the gap.
