While Leicester won 3-2 against West Bromwich Albion with an injury-time winner from Jamie Vardy, Villa could barely threaten Ben Foster, who was returning to league action for the first time since tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in March. There are signs of encouragement \u2013 this five-match unbeaten run is their longest of the season \u2013 but a sense lingers that not enough time remains. Still, when reasons to cheer are so hard to come by, the slimmest ray of light can mean a lot. Only a fortnight ago the relationship between players and supporters was cantankerous after Brad Guzan and Joleon Lescott were accused of swearing at fans during the FA Cup third round draw at Wycombe. Things boiled over and the players withstood a volley of vitriol when boarding their coach outside Adams Park. But here, in their first away game since, support never wavered and at the end the players showed their appreciation. It is a united front and at least now they look like going down with something resembling a fight. \u201cTo be fair I didn\u2019t ask them to do it,\u201d R\u00e9mi Garde, the manager, said of his players giving thanks. \u201cThis was something I asked when I came but not today. It is very important; you cannot split the players and the fans. When you\u2019re a player it\u2019s very important to have so many people behind you but I would have preferred if we were celebrating a win.\u201d Fifteen games remain and Villa are 10 points from safety but for all their newfound positivity, that gap appears insurmountable considering they have won only twice. Garde, though, promises to battle on until the unlikely becomes impossible. \u201cWe won\u2019t give up until the end,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure maybe some people have but our job is to believe until the end. I will be the last one to give up. I am really frustrated we have only played this way for the last four or five games. But we are going to try to do it until the end.\u201d Most of all the Villa manager wants a team of leaders and he again questioned the attitude of some fringe players. Garde is understood to have made his frustrations known to Jack Grealish during the Cup replay with Wycombe last Tuesday, while the club captain Gabriel Agbonlahor has been out of favour for weeks. \u201cThe door is closed for the players who don\u2019t have the right attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t only play on your talent, you have to play on your talent and for the team. This is what we have shown in last four or five games. You cannot play football if you are not a man.\u201d Garde was disappointed that the Croatia goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic was denied a work permit but remains hopeful of bolstering his squad by the time the transfer window closes next Monday. \u201cHopefully, yes. I don\u2019t know exactly what, but we will see. Sometimes the end of the transfer window is active and maybe it could be for us.\u201d The club are also set to appoint Eric Black, the former Coventry manager and Birmingham No2, as Garde\u2019s assistant. Black spent five years playing for Metz and the manager feels it is important to have a fluent French speaker alongside him. West Brom are far from safe. They have not won in four and, damningly, failed to register an attempt at home to the bottom-placed team. After Peterborough in the FA Cup this Saturday, they play Swansea and Newcastle \u2013 failure to win one of those could leave them in serious trouble.
