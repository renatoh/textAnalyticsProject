Stewart, an anti no-deal candidate who was knocked out of the Tory leadership contest after last week after a television debate, has vowed not to serve in a Johnson cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the proudest I\u2019ve been. It\u2019s the greatest job I\u2019ve ever had in government. It\u2019s an amazing department that makes a huge difference around the world. And it\u2019s greatly admired. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the Department for International Development in Iraq, Afghanistan going back over 15, 16 years. It really was the dream of my career, but unfortunately we will have to see who the next prime minister is.\u201d The former prisons minister, who had worked previously at DfID before he took over from Penny Mordaunt last month, said Johnson\u2019s stance on Europe would make it impossible to stay. Stewart, who has backed Johnson\u2019s rival Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative leadership contest, warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for Britain to attain UN targets to lift people out of poverty. \u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in this job if Boris was prime minister,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI don\u2019t think we he would want me, for a start, but it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m afraid on the very fundamental issue of the day, which is Brexit. \u201cI have said repeatedly that he is trying to deliver something that he can\u2019t deliver and he\u2019s going to disappoint people deeply. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a member of a cabinet arguing for a policy that I think is misleading.\u201d Stewart was at Torriano primary school in Camden, north London, to face questions from schoolchildren and to talk about the UK\u2019s progress towards the UN\u2019s global goals. A DfID review said that while Britain has made \u201csignificant strides\u201d on the targets, much remained to be done \u2013 particularly on the key UK priorities of reducing poverty and ensuring \u201cno one is left behind\u201d. Stewart said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was essential to achieving these goals. Asked how the government could better achieve its aim to reduce poverty, he said:\u201cFrom my point of view, we have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It sounds like a daft thing to say, but I think the economic damage it would do would reduce the amount of money that we have available. If we can deliver a sensible solution to Brexit there should be \u00a326m or \u00a327m more available, and I would like to see that invested firstly in education, and we should put more into policing and the NHS.\u201d The international development secretary, who pledged to put the climate crisis and the environment at DfID\u2019s heart, said the world was at risk of becoming \u201cmuch more difficult and unpleasant\u201d within 50 years without sweeping changes in sustainability. Stewart said he expected Johnson to retain the 0.7% target of gross national income for overseas aid, and hoped DfID would remain a standalone department despite Johnson\u2019s previous suggestions that it should be brought into the Foreign Office. \u201cMy understanding is that Boris is committed to keeping 0.7% and that\u2019s really important, because there were candidates in this race that were trying to get rid of 0.7%. That is central, partly because climate and the environment is something that is so intermeshed in the way we think about development and poverty, and the scale of the challenge we\u2019re facing on climate and the environment is literally multiple trillions of pounds.\u201d Esther McVey, an early leadership candidate, has suggested the 0.7% target should be cut. Stewart said that he felt close co-ordination between DfID and the Foreign Office would help in conflict zones like Somalia and South Sudan, but added: \u201cI would definitely want DfID to be a standalone department. It\u2019s also an achievement we have put into law and I would hope that whichever leader keeps this.\u201d During a tour of the school, which banned single-use plastic two years ago, Jonah, 11, asked Stewart about introducing a charge for bottles similar to the one introduced for plastic bags. Stewart replied: \u201cPlastic bottles I think would be a great opportunity and so would plastic coffee mugs\u201d. Stewart suggested that a charge of 1p for every bag of mixed waste would lead to more people recycling. He said if he \u201creally had money to spend\u201d, he would put \u00a31bn of research and development into universities to work on technology. \u201cIf you could develop light spectrum technology or solar film technology so the next time China builds a power generation station, instead of building it powered by coal, they built it, powered it by solar, that would probably make a bigger difference than almost anything else we did,\u201d he told pupils."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
