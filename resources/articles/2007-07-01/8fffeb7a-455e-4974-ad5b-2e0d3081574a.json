His detractors suggest Khan is an over-protected commodity who has yet to be tested. But his promoter, Frank Warren, the man charged with building Khan's career, argues with some justification that greats of the past like Sugar Ray Robinson and Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez took far longer to emerge at world level than the two years in which Khan has been in the paid ranks. Tonight the 20-year-old would-be world champion can make a significant step forward if he produces an emphatic victory against Limond, 28, who has lost only once in 29 contests, against the now world-rated super-featherweight Alex Arthur, who stopped him in eight rounds four years ago. Limond is undefeated in 10 fights since and is a well-schooled technician, if not a terrifying puncher. \"I am bigger, stronger, fitter and am ready to prove my critics wrong,\" said Khan yesterday. \"Willie Limond is a great fighter. Anyone who has watched him knows he is good. He has the moves, a good defence and has prepared for this for 10 weeks believing he can beat me. \"What I want is to win in style, and show everyone how well I have progressed. I am moving up a level. In two years as a pro I have done everything that has been asked of me and I am pretty much where I want to be. This fight can prove I am one of the best lightweights in the country, and that I will be one of the best fighters in the world. If I do my best I will be too fast for him and have too much power.\" Limond, a self-employed joiner when he is not boxing, has no illusions - \"I could fight for a world title but I don't think I could win one\" - but he is similarly convinced he can give Khan problems, and that anyone who regards him as no more than a half-decent name \"does'nae know the first thing about boxing\". Limond added: \"Me and my team think I will win. Amir has improved a lot in just 12 fights, but he has never been up against anyone like me. I never predict what will happen, but I will be asking him plenty of questions. I am improved out of all recognition from when I lost to Arthur.\" Khan is prepared to box to a 12-round points win but his sharp punching is world-class, even if his chin has not yet been seriously tested as a pro, and another quick stoppage cannot be ruled out. On a strong undercard Dagenham's undefeated featherweight Nicky Cook, 27, faces the Californian Steve Luevano, 26, for the WBO belt made vacant when Scott Harrison was stripped of the title last year after failing to make the weight for a defence against Cook. Luevano is a cute southpaw but Cook's aggression, allied to anticipated fervent support, could propel him to a hard-fought points victory. The 40-year-old Matt Skelton fights for the first time in over a year when he defends the Commonwealth heavyweight title against Michael Sprott, 32, whose appearance in February brought him a third-round knockout over Audley Harrison. Skelton holds a victory over Sprott but his lack of competitive action will encourage the 5-2 underdog. Kevin Mitchell, the 22-year-old super-featherweight from Dagenham, is seemingly on a collision course for Khan and will try for a 24th straight win when he faces the Russian Alexander Hrulev. The Commonwealth light-middleweight champion Bradley Pryce, from Enzo Calzaghe's stable, defends his title against the Londonder Anthony Small."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
