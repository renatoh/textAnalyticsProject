Balanced migration leads to a stable, not falling, population. Britain's Europe-leading rate of teenage pregnancy is of concern because these largely unplanned pregnancies often lead to poor life outcomes and larger families. And only 71% of women born in 1964 have had two or fewer children, hardly an overwhelming majority. Hanley's response to humanity's impact on the environment is that we should reduce consumption and move away from petrol, meat and imported fruit. In fact, most of the world's population is trying to increase consumption. Far from being miserly, calling for small families everywhere and providing fully funded family planning is considering the interests of future generations and biodiversity, as well as our own. It is the easiest, cheapest and more effective contribution to a more sustainable world. Simon Ross Chief executive, Population Matters \u2022\u2008In her passion to imagine an anti-human, hidden agenda behind widespread public concern at population rise in the UK and the world generally, Lynsey Hanley has forgotten that facts matter. The Green party does not assert that the UK population is too big, as she alleges. Nor that it is too small or just right, either. It does have a policy on population to raise awareness that unsustainability is a function of waste, overconsumption and population levels, and it calls for debate around these. It links them to education and healthcare, and promises improved family planning services. The Green party is very careful to emphasise the links, the connectedness, of these things, and it beggars belief that anyone could honestly allege, as she does, that it puts population at its \"focus\", and fails to make these connections. The article similarly misrepresents others' views. She lives in a world where the pope is a Presbyterian and bears defecate in public toilets. Chris Padley Lincoln \u2022\u2008Too many commentators on population issues, including Lynsey Hanley, ignore the fact that the universal desire to control one's own fertility remains unrealised for many people. Anyone who has lived in the developing world knows innumerable \u2013 especially poor \u2013 women who have more children than they wish. Their ability to choose in the interests of themselves and their families is thwarted by a combination of factors, especially political ham-fistedness and religious obstruction, a situation for which the Catholic church and certain Protestant groups bear most blame. Had women everywhere had the means to control their fertility for the past half-century, as we have had in the west, there would probably be no population problem today. Instead of regarding family planning as something forced on communities, we should simply enable women everywhere to effect their own choices.
