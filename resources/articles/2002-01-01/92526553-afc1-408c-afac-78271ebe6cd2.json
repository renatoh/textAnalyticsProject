In his lounge a framed photograph shows him leading his side out of the tunnel. A picture of the victorious team, signed by the players, hangs from the dining room wall. Go through to the kitchen and there is a shot of Sillett celebrating with his assistant George Curtis. Sky Blues rejoicing under blue skies. On Saturday, when Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur renew acquaintance in the FA Cup third round, the memories of a sun-drenched afternoon in north London, May 16 1987, will be reignited: Coventry 3 Tottenham 2, the last truly great FA Cup final at Wembley. At 65, Sillett is approaching the sort of age where he is running the risk of Dom Joly accosting him in a public park, but mere mention of the greatest day in Coventry's history and this wonderfully enthused sexagenarian starts talking like an overexcited teenager. He remembers the anguish as Clive Allen headed Tottenham into a second-minute lead. The pride as his team twice recovered from going behind. How they nullified the threat of Glenn Hoddle in his final game for Spurs. The pivotal moment in extra-time when Gary Mabbutt's own-goal saw him join Bert Turner of Charlton Athletic (1946) and Tommy Hutchison of Manchester City (1981) among that rare breed who have scored for both teams in FA Cup finals. And, joyously, the endearing image of Brian Kilcline, Coventry's craggy old centre-half, limping up to the royal box to collect the trophy. More than 250,000 people welcomed the team back to Coventry the next day. A modern-day Lady Godiva, complete with white horse, joined the celebrations. The cathedral's newly refurbished bells were rung for the first time. Heady days. Sillett is in his element, recalling his \"perfect day\". When talk turns to Coventry's second goal, it is as though he has perfected his own commentary. \"Steve Ogrizovic clears up to Cyrille Regis. He knocks it on to Keith Houchen, who releases Dave Bennett on the right. Bennett gets past his marker. He puts his cross in. And there's Houchen again. He throws himself at the ball like a dart. A diving header. Goooaall! It's one of the classic Wembley goals! Marvellous stuff!\" Sillett's big love these days is racehorses. He and his wife Jean had their biggest win in October when Major Laugh, whom they picked up for 2,500 guineas after he failed to attract a single bid in the auction ring, won the \u00a3100,000 Tattersalls Autumn Auction Stakes at Newmarket. Combined with working for Dave Sexton as one of Sven-Goran Eriksson's scouts (he watched Greece before England's crucial World Cup qualifier at Old Trafford and was \"terrified\" by what he saw) it means he rarely gets the chance to visit Highfield Road. However, he retains a close affinity with the club where he was manager from 1987 to 1990 and played under Jimmy Hill from 1962 to 1966. He was at Anfield when Coventry's 34-year stay in the top flight ended at Aston Villa in May and was taken aback by how badly it affected him. \"I hadn't cried for many years but when I heard the result I could not help myself,\" he recalls. \"I went into the gents, swallowed hard and shed a few tears.\" Understandably he prefers to remember happier days. \"I think about the final every day,\" he says. \"It was a brilliant game, end-to-end attacking football, not much thought given to defence. To be there was a dream come true; to come out on top was ecstasy. \"Spurs were most people's favourites. They had Glenn Hoddle, Chris Waddle, Clive Allen and so on. When I look back now I think one of my best ideas ever was asking the FA if we could train on the pitch beforehand. We had only four players with experience of playing at Wembley, while everyone in the Spurs side had been there at least once. That put us at a big disadvantage so I organised it for us to train on the pitch so we could get used to the surroundings. To be fair, the groundsman was brilliant about it.\" The abiding memory for most people is that of Sillett, drunk on euphoria, dancing a manic-eyed jig and pretending to swig from the trophy as he led his players on a victory lap. \"That was for Jimmy Greaves. We used to play together at Chelsea and when I spotted him in the television gantry I shouted up: 'I'm going to have a few of these tonight, Greavsie.' \"He may have been a former Tottenham player but the truth is that he helped me plot their downfall. He's a bright tactician, Greavsie, and the night before we talked about how I should approach the game. \"I don't think anyone was rooting for Coventry more than him, but I felt a bit sorry for him, I must admit. All the Coventry fans were giving him grief because he had tipped us to lose in every round. What they hadn't realised was that he was just obeying my instructions. I had told him he was the worst tipster in the world. I remember saying: 'For God's sake, don't you dare have us down to win.' And would you know it? It worked.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
