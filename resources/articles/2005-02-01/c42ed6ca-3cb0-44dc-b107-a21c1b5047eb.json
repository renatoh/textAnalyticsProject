Nodded to the smiley cabin attendant, stowed away your luggage in the overhead locker. And then - oh-my-God, this can't be happening - you spot a harassed-looking woman and her tribe of squawking brats edging towards you down the aisle. They can't be ... surely not ... but they are, making for the seats right alongside yours. Whatever the scary movie playing on the inflight cinema today, it's about to be eclipsed by the horrific real-life experience you're going to endure over the next eight hours. Everyone knows kids make the worst neighbours on a long (or even a short) distance flight. What most passengers do is what you're probably about to do right now: baton down the hatches, ram on the headphones and avert your eyes (after giving the panicky mum and her noisy offspring a disapproving once-over, naturally). Kids in the air are, after all, a menace. Ideally they'd all holiday in Cornwall. Every year. But British families are jetting away more often: the number of children on planes is growing, and growing fast. Surprisingly, no one collates the overall statistics, but most airlines say the figure is on the up: over the past five years, for example, British Airways has seen a steady 5% increase each year in child passengers - in 2004, around 1.2 million children travelled on its flights worldwide. So what are the airlines doing about it? And whose side are they on - the harassed parents', or the disgruntled unaccompanied adults'? The truth, of course, is there's only one side to be on, and that's firmly with the parents. Why? Well, because keeping kids happy means keeping everyone happy. Screaming, badly behaved, disruptive children make life hell for everybody. Content the little ones, and in one fell swoop everyone on board is calmer and happier. Some airlines are trying: recently, Gulf Air became the first airline to introduce in-flight \"sky nannies\". The nannies - all female - are a feature of every flight on the airline's long-distance routes and are, says Gulf, \"dedicated to delivering specialist care for children up to the age of 12\". A couple of weeks ago, I took my two-year-old, Catriona, on a seven-hour flight to the Middle East to try out the sky nanny service. Travelling alone with a demanding toddler is a scary business: if your kid plays it dirty, you're totally on your own (and can expect no mercy from your fellow flyers). Izabela, the sky nanny on our flight, was an ally from the outset: as soon as Catriona and I were settled into our seats she came along to say hello, asked when I'd like the child's meal served (before my own lunch, perhaps, so I could help her without having my own food go cold?) and handed us a healthy supply of sticker books, packets of crayons and colouring pads to see us through the gruelling hours ahead. She told me I was welcome to call on her to sit with Catriona when I wanted to go to the loo (which I gratefully did - unless you have a two-year-old of your own, you may be unaware of the havoc it is possible for a toddler to cause in an aeroplane toilet in the time it takes to empty your bladder). Before take-off, and again before landing, she came over to dispense advice on how to keep Catriona's ears from hurting (sucking on a dummy or chewing gum would work wonders, apparently - unfortunately neither was appropriate in Catriona's case as she's too old for a dummy and too young for chewing gum, but I appreciated the thought). And when we arrived, tired and emotional, in Bahrain, she gamely trotted all the way to passport control to help with our too-numerous cabin bags. Like all the sky nannies, Izabela was recruited from the ranks of ordinary cabin attendants but she already had experience with children, having worked in the US as an au pair. Som, the nanny on our return flight, had been a nursery teacher. Both had attended the special Gulf Air nanny training course at Norland College, the centre that trains the best-known nannies in the world. \"It teaches you some useful things about the different stages of childhood and what to expect from each age group,\" Izabela told us. \"And, of course, we spend lots of time learning ways to keep kids entertained in a small space.\" Alas, though, Gulf hasn't found a way to let its sky nannies off trolley duty. In a seat two rows behind me, a mother was trying to cope with two under-twos alone: at one stage her younger child had the sort of screaming fit that had everyone, probably including the captain, reaching for their ear plugs. Izabela could have come in handy, but she was unavailable ... serving the drinks. Gulf is aiming high, and that's good, but all airlines could aim a lot higher when it comes to keeping families happy. What matters most to anyone squeezed into an aeroplane seat is the quality of the gimmicks: but while airlines put lots of thought into the endless bits and pieces to keep adult passengers amused, they do surprisingly little for their neediest passengers, the under-12s. Of 25 visual channels on my flight, only two were remotely child-friendly (and neither of these was suitable for a child as young as two). Of a similar number of audio channels, only one was kids' stories - and again, they weren't stories like the Gruffalo for tinies (which would have kept Catriona happy for at least half an hour), they were scary stories for sevens and up. Space is always at a premium on planes - but while first- and business-class passengers are being wooed with the possibility of on-board beds, mums and dads haven't even got proper nappy changing facilities. The pull-down tables in aircraft loos are nothing like long enough for an older baby or toddler. On my flight, a mother in a quiet corner decided she'd have to change her two year old in his seat, only to get complaints from fellow passengers. Airlines say they're doing more for families - see below - but in reality a lot of what they promise is badly thought-through. Some boast, for example, that they board families first: but why would families want to board first, since that just means more time to be squashed into too small a space? What families want - have airlines never thought to ask them this? - is to board last, like business- and first-class travellers. And yes, it's great that they let you take your buggy right up to the plane door - but why can't they return it to you before the baggage carousel in the terminal building at the other end? \"You should have made a special request, madam,\" a steward told me when we arrived in Bahrain - but what parent, having needed their buggy for the interminable trek to the gate at the departure airport, wouldn't need it all the more for the similar marathon ahead when they landed - exhausted, to boot? Some canny parents, disgruntled at the horrors of being airborne with their offspring, are now booking themselves into business, but leaving the kids back in economy. British Airways is one of the many airlines which says it has no problem with this - it can't really object, as it offers an unaccompanied minors' service - and will take responsibility for five to 12 year olds with the proviso that they mustn't visit mummy and daddy during the flight (another plus from the parents' viewpoint, presumably). But whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of this practice, it's a choice most of us couldn't afford to make. Separation isn't the way forward: airlines putting a bit more informed thought into families' needs is. Maybe things will change: 10 years ago, after all, in-flight food was stodgy and dull, and still water wasn't even available. Today the food is light and there's plenty of fruit and - yes - water. Airlines saw the need, they listened to the arguments, and they changed their ways. Maybe in the next decade, the same thing will happen for families. Maybe. Make it easy on yourself \u00b7 If it's a long flight and you have an older baby, consider forking out on an extra seat. Most airlines charge 10% of adult fares for babies up to two years, but they don't get their own seat. \u00b7 Allow at least an extra hour at the airport. \u00b7 Choose a window seat if you're travelling alone with a baby (more privacy for breastfeeding) and an aisle seat with a toddler (easy access to the washroom). \u00b7 A sling may be an easier way to transport your baby on to the plane, and means you won't miss your buggy if it's not returned to you until the baggage carousel. \u00b7 Breast or bottle feed babies on take-off and landing to prevent earache due to cabin pressure, and give older kids sweets or chewing gum. \u00b7 For younger children on a night flight, take pyjamas and change them to help them settle down to sleep. \u00b7 Take at least 24 hours' supply of nappies, changes of clothes etc in your in-flight bag in case of lost luggage or a surprise stopover.
