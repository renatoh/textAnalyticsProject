The latest attack came two days after a terrorist killed three people at a church in Nice and two weeks after the beheading of a high school teacher. Police and soldiers immediately sealed off Lyon\u2019s 7th arrondissement in the hunt for the gunman and later made an arrest. The priest, said to be a Greek national aged 52, was closing the church when the man armed with a sawn-off shotgun fired at him several times, hitting him twice in the stomach. French TV is reporting that it seems to be a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d. Police are saying they are looking at all motives, but are advising journalists not to jump to conclusions that the incident is \u201cterror\u201d linked, despite the tensions and high level of alert in France. On Saturday, French anti-terrorist police were still questioning three men in connection with the Nice attack as they tried to piece together the killer\u2019s movements and establish if he had accomplices. A man, aged 47, who was taken into police custody hours after the attack on Thursday and was reported to have been in contact with knifeman Brahim Issaoui the previous day, is still being held. Investigators gave no more details of the arrests of two other men aged 33 and 35. Issaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian who killed the three people at the city\u2019s Notre Dame basilica, remains in a serious condition in hospital after being shot by police inside the church. Issaoui was originally named as Aouissaoui based on an Italian Red Cross document he was carrying, but his correct identity was confirmed by his family at Bou Hajla near Sfax in Tunisia. Over the weekend, shocked and grieving locals continued to lay flowers outside the Notre Dame de l\u2019Assomption basilica. In the crowds, one woman\u2019s cry rose like a collective wail: \u201cWhy us? Why us again?\u201d It was a sentiment echoed across France. The Nice killings hit a country already reeling from the beheading of a history teacher outside his high school near Paris less than two weeks before. Samuel Paty, 47, had shown pupils two caricatures of the prophet Muhammad as part of a discussion on free speech. The reprinting of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons has provoked a wave of anti-French protests in Islamic countries, and France has been on high alert. On Saturday, President Emmanuel Macron tried to calm anti-French protests in a 55-minute interview with Al Jazeera. Macron said he \u201cunderstands the feelings of Muslims about the caricatures\u201d of the prophet. \u201cThe caricatures are not a government project but rather the product of free and independent newspapers that are not affiliated with the government.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the reactions were due to lies and misrepresentation and because people think I am in favour of these caricatures.\u201d As the government began expelling individuals and disbanding organisations it accused of fostering \u201cIslamism\u201d \u2013 which in French is understood to mean \u201cIslamist fundamentalism\u201d \u2013 in the wake of Paty\u2019s murder on 16 October, the terrorist attack in Nice came as a further kick to a country that was still down. Hours later, a stringent new national Covid-19 lockdown came into effect adding to a sense of dejection. The despondency was particularly acute in Nice. In five years, the Riviera city has suffered three terrorist attacks. In February 2015, three soldiers patrolling outside a Jewish community centre in Nice were wounded by a man vowing allegiance to Islamic State. In 2016, a terrorist drove a lorry into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 and injuring 458. Last week had started with Turkey and France trading verbal blows and anti-Macron protests after the French president insisted that newspapers and magazines like Charlie Hebdo had the right to publish contested caricatures. By midweek, it was, according to the interior minister, G\u00e9rard Darmanin, \u201ca war\u201d, not of words but of ideologies. Then came Nice. A lone candle on the granite pavement next to a small bunch of primroses marked the spot where 44-year-old Simone Barreto Silva collapsed from her knife wounds. It was here, at the Unik kebab shop, while being tended to by paramedics, that she uttered her final words: \u201cTell my children I love them.\u201d Michel Atiah, head waiter at the neighbouring Le Socrate restaurant, described Silva as the life and soul of the party. \u201cShe was a lovely woman and very popular in the neighbourhood.\u201d Another regular at Le Socrate was Vincent Loqu\u00e8s, the church sexton, who died inside the basilica. \u201cWe often saw him. Vincent was a lovely, gentle man who used to eat here regularly. \u201cThis is a mixed community \u2013 I am originally from Syria. We all deplore this action. Nice has been rocked by what happened yesterday and by what happened on the seafront four years ago. But it is important to remember that these are lone wolves, not representative of the Islamic community.\u201d On Saturday, the killer\u2019s first victim was named as 60-year-old Nadine Devillers. \u201cShe often went to pray for people she loved. From time to time she lit a candle. She was someone who loved others, gave everything for others,\u201d her friend Jo\u00eblle Guichard told Nice-Matin newspaper. Inevitably, the far right has called for expulsions and a moratorium on immigration from certain countries holding anti-French protests. Marine Le Pen has called the attacks \u201cacts of war\u201d requiring a warlike response. At a rally in Nice on Thursday night her supporters chanted for Muslims to \u201cgo home\u201d, and in rue Alsace Lorraine near the basilica, protesters banged on the windows of a north African restaurant. \u201cThat is not the intelligent approach to take,\u201d said Nathalie, who works at the Brunet bakery in the same street. \u201cTaking reprisals against innocent folk is not going to put right the act of a lone madman.\u201d She added: \u201cMonsieur Loqu\u00e8s came here practically every day for his baguettes. He was a kind and gentle man. I don\u2019t think we are in danger of being overwhelmed by hate, more of an explosion of anger. We must be wary of that.\u201d On Sunday, French soldiers, police and gendarmes will be dispatched to protect churches and other places of worship for the important Toussaint \u2013 All Saints \u2013 holiday. In Trappes, south-west of Paris in the Yvelines \u2013 the department where Paty was killed \u2013 which has a large Muslim community officials and religious leaders will plant an olive tree outside the Catholic church. Ali Rabeh, the mayor of Trappes, said it was a \u201csymbolic gesture of solidarity\u201d with the Catholic community. Rabeh has cautioned politicians against ramping up the rhetoric of war and stigmatising \u201cthe \u201c99.9% of French Muslims who are calm, peaceful and don\u2019t want to bother anyone\u201d. \u201cThe political atmosphere is becoming more and more accusatory. Each time there is an attack, ordinary Muslims feel the finger is being pointed at them, that they carry the weight of accusations,\u201d Rabeh told the Observer. He said he was appalled to discover that his father, a Muslim who came to France from Morocco 50 years ago and had worked \u201cto help build this country\u201d for more than four decades, \u201cnow feels he has to lower his head when he goes shopping\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
