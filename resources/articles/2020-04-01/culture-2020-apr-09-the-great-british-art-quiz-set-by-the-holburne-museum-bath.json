Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Holburne Museum, Bath. At the heart of the Holburne Museum is the collection of Sir William Holburne (1793\u20131874), fifth baronet of Menstrie. It was his wish that his collection be left to the City of Bath for everyone to enjoy. Since his death, more than 2,000 items have been added to his collection, including portrait miniatures, porcelain, embroideries and portraits by some of the greatest artists of the 18th century. You can see art from the Holburne Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the Holburne Museum website here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
