It\u2019s a role that suits him well, carving his way through to set up May. 8 Joe Cokanasiga Wreaking havoc from the off, always looking to offload and pose an attacking threat. All that was missing was a try. Defensive positioning not quite perfect. 9 Manu Tuilagi This was Tuilagi at his bulldozing best. Thundered through Esposito for first Test try in five years, terrorised Allan for Shields\u2019s score and showed great pace for his second. 9 Ben Te\u2019o Not as eye-catching as Tuilagi but made some hard yards and imposed himself in defence. This will not be the last time we see this centre pairing. 7 Jonny May Another try made it 13 in 14 for England\u2019s deadly finisher. Football skills weren\u2019t quite up to it when closing in on another one. Tackled Italian medic for reasons unclear. 7 Owen Farrell (capt) The kind of professional performance you would expect from him in this fixture. Boos for kicking at goal after 25 minutes were somewhat harsh. 8 Ben Youngs Feasted on front-foot ball throughout the first half. Always hard in these matches but might have kept the tempo a little higher in second half. 7 Ellis Genge Didn\u2019t get the chance to show his carrying strengths but made a huge tackle on Bigi to win penalty and scrummaged well. Much better than previous start, against Samoa in 2017. 7 Jamie George Commanding at the lineout and scored his second Test try. This championship has confirmed him as England\u2019s first choice, regardless of Hartley\u2019s fitness. 8 Kyle Sinckler Curious early decision to kick. Always vocal but by the standards he has set in Wales he was quiet in terms of influencing proceedings. No complaints though. 7 Joe Launchbury Was out of position and exposed for Allan\u2019s try but gave his all as he always does. Made a shed load of tackles but missed more than he usually does. 7 George Kruis Ran a flawless lineout but did make a mess of one restart. Often gets a charge-down and it paid off twice here with a try under the posts and a second for Shields. 8 Brad Shields Disappointed with himself for forward pass that denied Curry an early try but on hand for his first for England and couldn\u2019t miss for number two after Kruis\u2019s charge down. 8 Tom Curry Conceded an early penalty at the breakdown but just keeps going and going. Made two superb tackles in as many seconds at one point in the second half. 7 Billy Vunipola Further evidence he is nearing his best. So many carries, not always much yardage, but gets England on the front foot time and again. Very impressive. 9 Replacements Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George 59) 6; Ben Moon (for Genge 59) 6; Dan Cole (for Sinckler 56) 6; Nathan Hughes (for Launchbury 66) 7; Mark Wilson (for Curry 56) 7; Dan Robson (for Youngs 62) trademark support line for try 7; George Ford (for Farrell 62) 6; Henry Slade (for Tuilagi 62) 6 Italy Jayden Hayward 6; Edoardo Padovani 5, Michele Campagnaro 4, Luca Morisi 7, Angelo Esposito 4; Tommaso Allan 7, Tito Tebaldi 5; Andrea Lovotti 5, Luca Bigi 5, Simone Ferrari 5, Federico Ruzza 7, Dean Budd 6, Sebastian Negri 6, Braam Steyn 6, Sergio Parisse (capt) 6 Replacements Leonardo Ghiraldini (for Bigi 49) 5; Cherif Traor\u00e8 (for Parisse 62) N/A; Tiziano Pasquali (for Ferrari 49) 6; David Sisi (for Budd 49) 6; Jake Polledri (for Negri 49) 5; Guglielmo Palazzani (for Morisi 62) 5; Ian McKinley (for Castello 33) 6; Tommaso Castello (for Campagnaro 23) N/A"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
