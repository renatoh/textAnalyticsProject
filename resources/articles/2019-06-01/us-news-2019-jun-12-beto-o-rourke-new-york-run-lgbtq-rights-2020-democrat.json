This morning it's Pride and fighting prejudice", "bodyText": "Beto O\u2019Rourke likes running. The presidential candidate has made jogging part of his election toolkit, from his campaign against the decidedly less athletic Ted Cruz, to repeated 5km jaunts across Iowa as he bids for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Wednesday morning saw O\u2019Rourke\u2019s latest display of physical prowess, as the former Texas congressman popped up in New York to run two miles with LGBTQ activists. O\u2019Rourke is due shortly to launch a series of policies to protect gay rights. O\u2019Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries. \u201cEverybody ready to run?\u201d O\u2019Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. \u201cTwo miles is all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added, which served to lift spirits a little. With that, O\u2019Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs. Paul Humphries was dressed more traditionally, in shorts and a rainbow-emblazoned Beto for Senate T-shirt, although confessed he was not much of a trackman. \u201cI am a runner, although not a very good one,\u201d he said. Humphries is originally from Texas and has been living in New York for the past 15 years. Despite the Beto T-shirt, he is yet to choose a candidate to support. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still open. But I think Beto\u2019s an important part of the conversation we\u2019re having.\u201d The O\u2019Rourke campaign said the run was \u201cin honor of Pride month\u201d, and coincided with the unveiling of several LGBTQ-focused policies. As president, O\u2019Rourke would take executive action to reverse Donald Trump\u2019s ban on trans people in the military, his team said, and would create a universal healthcare system \u201cwith explicit protections against discrimination\u201d. O\u2019Rourke said: \u201cToo many LGBTQ+ people still lack protection under many states\u2019 laws and the current administration is encouraging rather than stamping out discrimination. We must ensure all Americans are treated equally no matter who they are or who they love.\u201d O\u2019Rourke has been criticized for an early lack of specific policy ideas \u2013 and a perceived sense of entitlement \u2013 but the Human Rights Campaign, in endorsing O\u2019Rourke for the Senate in 2018, described him as a \u201cproven champion of equality\u201d. Runner Nora Moore said: \u201cHe\u2019s an ally of so many marginalized communities and I think he walks the walk and I find that inspirational in a politician.\u201d Moore, 36, was running with a stroller containing her four-year-old daughter Fiona. She said she has trained for two half-marathons in this fashion, and showed no signs of fatigue as the runners headed towards the finish. O\u2019Rourke is Moore\u2019s choice for the nomination \u201cas of right now\u201d; she has been volunteering for his campaign in New York. She said: \u201cI\u2019m one of those complicit individuals who sort of was asleep at the wheel a little bit, thought everything was great, assumed my girl Hillary was going to win, and then when it didn\u2019t happen I just got really invested in being more involved.\u201d O\u2019Rourke was riding high on the winds of his close loss to Cruz when he entered the 2020 race. But in a recent Iowa poll he had just 2% of the vote, and in New Hampshire just 1%. Despite that, O\u2019Rourke was defiant when the Guardian asked about his drooping numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s no poll taken in June the year before a presidential election that accurately predicted the outcome,\u201d he said. He pointed to low polling numbers during his Texas Senate race. \u201cWe cannot allow polls to determine our chances. Nor as president will I allow polls to determine what we focus on. We\u2019ll do what is right for the right reasons, regardless of the political consequences.\u201d As for the run, O\u2019Rourke showed no sign of tiring, unlike the Guardian. As this reporter strained to keep up, Moore dashed past, Fiona bobbing up and down in the stroller. She was followed by the man in the white jeans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
