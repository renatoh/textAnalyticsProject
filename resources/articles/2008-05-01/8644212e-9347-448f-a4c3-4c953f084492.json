Man, that'd be sweet. I'd be handsome, rich, widely feted for my genius as an ad-man, with a half-nuts Vera Miles lookalike at home in the placid suburbs, and two entirely sane mistresses in town. Okay, I probably wouldn't be much good at ruthlessly discarding everyone who ever loved me. Actually, come to think of it ... I might flourish at it. Ah yes, but ... it would be 1960 all over again, the year that constituted the climax of the Technicolor, CinemaScope 1950s, rather than the onset of the 60s per se. Cars would have huge fins, strokable, chrome-encrusted curves and squashy whitewall tires, and so would the women; the shadow of the Bomb would loom over us, making us all paranoid every time Kruschev banged his shoe on the table at the UN; the dollar would be worth a dollar, not half a quid like now; America, with full employment and a full-steam-ahead economy, would still bestride the world like a colossus, and drinking three martinis at lunchtime wouldn't raise an eyebrow among civilised people. And the movies would be fantastic. By which I mean all the movies that the makers of Mad Men poured into the show's ambiance and background. Movies like Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running from 1958, which gets a reissue this Friday. It's a bold, bravura piece of Technicolor Expressionism that was also ground zero for the Rat Pack Follies of the next five years - the first time Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin (and \"girls\" auxiliary member Shirley MacLaine) appeared onscreen together, and the very best. This was the heyday of the postwar movie melodrama for adults, a genre that has long since expired, along with all the social taboos that energised it. How I wish it was still around. Directors like Minnelli and Douglas Sirk (All That Heaven Allows), Nicholas Ray (Bigger Than Life), Richard Quine (Strangers When We Meet), Jean Negulesco (The Best Of Everything - a key inspiration for Mad Men's female characters) and Martin Ritt (No Down Payment) found oodles of perversity and mania in the newly spreading suburbs, along with alcoholism, promiscuity and its evil twin, frigidity (see Minnelli's asylum drama The Cobweb - in which Richard Widmark is frigid around his wife Gloria Grahame, who in turn is horny for every teenage boy in sight). Most of them were based on fat bestsellers riding the crest of the paperback revolution, set in train by Grace Metalious's Peyton Place (hey, there's another one). Trouble is, in order to revive such a genre, you'd have to recreate the social context that enabled it: a still-segregated South, genteel anti-Semitism rampant, the status of wives not much above that of chattel, no Pill yet for their single sisters, a nationwide closet for homosexuals, the shadow of McCarthy still looming, and all of that. So maybe it's not such a great idea after all. Still, I can dream."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
