How they attract any custom at all is beyond me. Ivydene House is quite the opposite \u2013 its site does the most important thing of all \u2013 it makes me want to stay. The web pages look like a photograph album, monochrome backgrounds allowing the photographs to make an impact. A redbrick house of indeterminate age is framed on the front cover. I can see a garden bursting with lushness, a pond and a tennis court. The typewritten site menu reminds me of school name tags. The tariff page is designed as washing hung on a line. Driving through Uckinghall, I spot the house name at the end of a short drive, park where it says Parking (wonder who that man is, at his desk in a little outhouse office) and follow a small wooden sign saying B&amp;B, which is poking out of a flower bed. If this were Through the Keyhole, I'd say it is the house of someone who likes order. Then Rosemary Gallagher is showing me inside. She and husband Peter (he's an accountant; that's him in his office) have lived here for 20 years. If I like the B&amp;B website, says Rosemary, I should look at Pete's. Their daughter did them both. (I do take a look later \u2013 it's brilliant, and provides me with a rare opportunity to get laughter and accountant into the same sentence.) Eight years ago, instead of downsizing once the family had grown, Rosemary started doing B&amp;B. People mostly stay to break a journey, she says, because their 200-year-old house, once a smallholding, is so handy for the M5 and M50. The house exceeds the promise of the website. With an eye for colour and proportion, Rosemary has created homely spaces with plenty of personality. The sitting room \u2013 where she brings tea \u2013 has big fat sofas, Indian candlesticks, lamplight everywhere and a stripe of new paint on one wall where she is obsessing about how many tones lighter to go when she redecorates. Through a doorway the breakfast room is courageously, louchely navy, lined with bookshelves, and has a communal rustic wooden table. In summer, though, she will bring breakfast out into the garden, or serve it in the conservatory. Upstairs \u2013 a witty birdcage sticker on the landing, and modern art. My room is the larger of the two (but both have proper, separate bathrooms and are very private, lying either side of a landing). I have a bedroom, a dressing room and a shower room. \"If the noise disturbs you, just switch it off at the back,\" she says, showing me a mini fridge in the dressing room (between the bedroom and the shower). A simple embroidered hand towel hangs on an antique wooden stand. An antique leather hatbox has found new life as a drinks table. A kilim lends colour to a pair of mismatched vintage leather armchairs. My bed is made up with snowy whiteness, linen hearts and a flower-sprigged quilt. You can pay an awful lot more than Rosemary's modest rates for this level of quality and detail. Breakfast goes to the top of the chart for flavour and presentation. Aga toast, the yellowest egg, little beaded covers on jugs of milk and juice. What a pity that most of Ivydene's guests (including me) stay just one night to break a journey north or south. In summer and autumn you will have the run of the very large garden \u2013 but try to factor in an extra night. sally.shalam@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
