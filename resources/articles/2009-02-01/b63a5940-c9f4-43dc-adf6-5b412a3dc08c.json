Lance Armstrong, seven-time winner of cycling's Tour de France, cancer survivor and ex of rocker Sheryl Crow, hoped that the Tour of California would offer a stimulating but not overly demanding return to racing in the US following his short-lived retirement. But yesterday morning Armstrong was greeted with every cyclist's worst fear: someone had nicked his bike. This, however, was no ordinary David Cameron-style tourer left at the bike rack at Tesco's. Armstrong's bike is a one-in-a-kind, a distinctive black and gold contraption made by Trek, one of the 37-year-old's sponsors. As the victim of the crime himself noted, it might be hard to peddle at the local flea market. \"There is only one like it in the world,\" Armstrong wrote on his Twitter feed early yesterday morning, \"therefore hard to pawn off. Reward being offered.\" Police said they were looking for leads to help find the bicycle thieves in Sacramento, where the tour's prologue took place on Saturday. Armstrong's bike, along with those of his team-mates, was locked in the back of an unmarked truck parked in an alleyway behind the unprepossessing Residence Inn. Some time between 10pm on Saturday night, after what Armstrong declared was a gruelling, freezing day's cycling, and 6.45am yesterday morning, thieves broke into the truck and took four bikes. \"Whoa!!\" wrote the cyclist. \"They just came to my room and said our truck was broken into and someone stole my time trial bike! Wtf?!? APB out to all the twitterati.\" The twitterati responded in kind. \"I hope they nail the dirty bastages to the wall and hit them with rotten fruit and veggies,\" wrote one twitterer. Another noted a lead that may have eluded the Sacramento police department. \"Funny looking Time Trial Bike TTX 9.9,\" said the posting on the San Francisco-based advertising forum Craigslist. \"$12,000 (Switzerland). Supposed to be one of a kind. Requirements for payment: 1. Must have cash in Euros. 2. Meet in a dark alley in China Town. Ask for Fabian Cancellara.\" Cancellara, as those hardy enough to withstand the rain during the weekend's stages will know, was the Tour leader until he dropped out with a fever yesterday. Losing his bike turned out to be just one of the many misfortunes hurled at Armstrong as he contemplates his latest improbable sporting feat. During yesterday's 107-mile stage, riding another bike, he had a flat tyre and crashed, before working his way back to the peloton and fifth position overall. \"Holy hell,\" he wrote yesterday evening. \"That was terrible. Maybe one of the toughest days I've had on a bike ... I'm still freezing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
