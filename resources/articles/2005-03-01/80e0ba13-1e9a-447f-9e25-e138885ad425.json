A single sentence will suffice for modern man: he fornicated and read the papers.' Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs suggests that its director largely agrees with this, except that his version would read - 'fornicated and went to pop concerts'. Winterbottom is one of our liveliest, least predictable and most productive film-makers, the nearest we've ever had to Jean-Luc Godard and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He's made road movies, an exploration of the Manchester music scene, two Hardy adaptations (one of them as a western), a state-of-the-nation film, a piece of dystopian sci-fi and one of the most striking pictures about the plight of refugees. So when he decides to turn his hand to a love story involving the actors in explicit sex for purposes of realism, we must accept his sincerity and good faith and not merely dismiss the result as hard-core pornography, which, in some respects, it necessarily resembles. His leading characters, 21-year-old American student Lisa (Margo Stilley) and the slightly older Englishman, Matt (Kieran O'Brien), who's some sort of environmental scientist, meet listening to the cacophonous Black Rebel Motor Cycle Club at the Brixton Academy and have a torrid affair, mainly conducted at his London flat, over a period of some months in 2004. He's dark, a heavy smoker, Celtic-looking, uncircumcised; she's thin, small-breasted, a little taller than him, pert in a girl-next-door manner. Their sole recreation apart from sex is attending fashionable rock venues and their bouts of lovemaking are punctuated by extracts from nine of the concerts they go to, it being the film-maker's belief that what we remember from an affair is the physical intimacy and the music. The point of view is Matt's. He's obsessed with the snowy wastes of the south and while he's on a professional expedition to the South Pole, he looks back to his days with Lisa. This is a variation on Wordsworth's 'emotion recollected in tranquillity' - copulation recollected in Antarctica. As Winterbottom is something of a missionary in this project, it's appropriate that Matt and Lisa are first seen adopting the most conventional of sexual positions. They soon abandon this for girl-on-top, oral sex, and games-playing. He blindfolds Lisa and ties her to the bedstead with her stockings and tells her to imagine she's stretched out on a beach in Thailand. (The perversity of this was, of course, less striking to audiences who saw the picture before the tsunami.) While masturbating with a vibrator, she has memories (or fantasies) of being aroused by a lapdancer. 'Do you think we'll ever make love without a condom?' he asks post-coitally and the answer is left hanging in the air to provide the movie's single element of suspense. When the film takes an earnest tone with a build up to the end of the affair, Matt and Lisa, instead of dressing down for a rock venue, spend the night in a smart hotel and dress up to attend Michael Nyman's 60th birthday concert. As soon as the moving camera was invented, there were explicit sex movies, invariably involving prostitutes and out-of-work actors. The first non-porn movie to feature proper actors was Oshima's recondite Empire of the Senses, given a restricted exhibition in this country (though with the encouragement of the then chief censor, James Ferman). But recently, there have been several sexually explicit movies from France, all intellectually pretentious in the manner of Pauline R\u00e9age and Georges Bataille, and Winterbottom's original notion was to film Michel Houellebecq's sexually explicit novel Platform. 'How come books can do this but film, which is far greater disposed to it, can't?' Well, the answer to that question is that an author imagines scenes and a reader recreates them in his mind without recourse to suborning others, however willing they may seem, in the public enactment of a peculiarly private act. I have no objection to erotic entertainments and believe that sexually exciting readers and viewers is a valid artistic activity. But while the man and woman on the Clapham omnibus will no doubt be aroused by 9 Songs (the Clapham omnibus no doubt took the movie's duo to and from the Brixton Academy), they are much more likely to be pleased and stimulated by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie's sexual idyll in Don't Look Now, the most erotic scene of its kind in the English-speaking cinema. Compared with it, 9 Songs resembles not so much conventional hardcore porn as a rather solemn sex-education film. Moreover, Lisa and Matt are a dull pair when they're not in action. True, they snort coke, drink a deal of wine and chop vegetables in the kitchen. But though Matt describes her as '21, beautiful, egotistical and crazy', Lisa's conversation when not saying: 'Fuck me pleeese' and: 'Fuck me faster', runs to things like: 'I want to bite you and hurt you and make you bleed' and: 'Sometimes you have to have faith in people.' He's given to philosophical observations on the Antarctic such as: 'It's claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same time, like two people in bed together', and musing during a solo visit to a rock venue about '5,000 people in a room and you can still feel alone'. The principal joke in this humourless movie is the running time - exactly 69 minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
