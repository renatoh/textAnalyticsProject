Such may yet occur over the next three rounds, but the first day of the 131st Open could scarcely have been more benign. Hence, Spain's Sergio Garcia would surely have been mightily disappointed if somebody had suggested to him beforehand that he would shoot par. As it worked out, he was rather relieved. Tiger did not go mad, and nobody else burned up the course, so Garcia will start this morning in reasonably optimistic mood. But it had not looked that way when the hugely talented young Spaniard set off in the company of Greg Norman and the tall and stately Swede Robert Karlsson. A fluffed bunker shot on the 1st saw him immediately drop a shot, and his shoulders followed. He is not a small man, 5ft 11in, but as the round progressed he appeared to be ever shrinking in comparison with the 6ft Norman and the 6ft 5in Karlsson. And by the 7th, which he double-bogeyed, he appeared ready to slink off into the rough and quietly lose himself, which is eminently possible given the length of the grass. \"I hit an eight-iron into the face of the bunker and couldn't get it out,\" he moaned. It was at the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers, otherwise known as Muirfield, that Garcia won the British Amateur Open four years ago, so he clearly holds some affection for it. Perhaps he returned his mind to that triumph as he headed somewhat limply into the back nine, three over par. It would be unfair to say the galleries had barely noticed him up until this point, although there was no doubt that Norman was the man they had come to watch, even though he has been living on past glories for nearly six years now. The 47-year-old Australian multimillionaire, who won the Open at Turnberry in 1986 and at Sandwich seven years later, still cuts an imposing figure, striding through the sand dunes and along the fairways like a pioneer in search of new horizons. This, of course, is an illusion, for despite his carefully weighted assurances that \"I would not be here if I thought I could not win\", those days are long over. He has been a broken reed since Nick Faldo cut him down so horribly in the 1996 Masters. But there were those at Muirfield yesterday who clearly still retained vivid mental images of the great days, and there was a genuine warmth behind the applause that greeted his more special moments. These are becoming fewer and fewer, although a couple of bunker shots were as good as anyone produced all day. In the end the sum of Norman's efforts was the same as Garcia's, namely par, but the crowd may have felt they had better value from the Australian. It was a question of expectations. Whereas the odd flash of fading brilliance was enough from Norman, the demands on Garcia, 22, were altogether different. Here was the man who at the beginning of the year had spelled out his intentions of being the No1 in both Europe and the US. If anybody was going to stop the Tiger in his tracks it was going to be the Spaniard. But such was his underwhelming form over the first nine yesterday that it was impossible not to empathise with the sotto voce inquiry from a wife to her husband on the 4th: \"Who exactly is that chap playing with Norman and Karlsson?\" Thankfully, for both the crowd and himself, the real Garcia began to emerge after the turn as he birdied both the par-four 11th and 12th. His step became positively jaunty, and instead of lurking at the back of the threesome, as if a touch embarrassed, the Spaniard finally began to resemble a player with a top-10 status. As the trio cut across from the 17th to the 18th, all having birdied it, Garcia was smiling broadly, a far cry from the first couple of hours of brooding frustration. By this time he knew Woods had only (and the word is obviously relative) hit a 70, thus making Garcia's world an altogether brighter and happier place. Not that his tribulations were totally done with. His second shot to the 18th nestled nastily in another bunker and Norman had played a beauty, putting further pressure on him. \"That's going to be ugly,\" opined an American female spectator, not without a hint of relish. Garcia climbed into the pit and out of it. He rehearsed; he drew deep breaths. Suddenly all the hard work down the back nine was in real danger of being undone. Unlike at the 7th, the ball described a gentle parabola before settling some six feet or so from the hole. The crowd was impressed, but not Garcia. He slammed his club into the sand with undisguised venom. Composure was vital, and to his credit he responded with the most secure of putts to par both hole and round. \"What you don't want to do is put yourself out of it early,\" he said. This he managed not to do, but it was a struggle, as it was for many, although the weather was blameless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
