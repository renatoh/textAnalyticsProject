Sarah's mother, Sara, said on the steps of Lewes crown court: \"Let's make sure that this stops happening time and time again. People are being let out of prison when everybody concerned knows they are going to be at it again.\" She called for adoption of \"Sarah's law\", under which parents would have access to lists of paedophiles living in their neighbourhoods. Is there a precedent for this? The United States passed Megan's Law in 1996 following the murder of Megan Kanka, 7, at the hands of Jesse Timmendequas, who had been convicted for two sex crimes and lived with two other known offenders. Megan's family had no idea of their proximity to a convicted child molester until Timmendequas was charged with her murder. A public backlash whipped up after the murder led to adoption of new paedophile laws. The most notable change was that American people now have the right to know if a convicted paedophile is living in their area. How does the US system function? 21 US states, mainly in the midwest and in the south, post details of child abusers on the internet. Different states use different methods. In Florida, for example, photographs are posted on a website alongside details of the offender's crime, date of birth and address. The most dangerous paedophiles carry a \"predator\" alert. In other states, the details of sex offenders are posted at local police stations and libraries. Elsewhere, homes within a half-mile radius of a known paedophile's address are posted with leaflets warning them of the offender's presence. Does it work? No doubt some parents feel safe in the knowledge that they live in a paedophile-free neighbourhood. However, there has been a modest increase in child sex crimes since the law was adopted. Of course, there is nothing to stop a paedophile giving a false address or going underground. Investigators looking at one group of sex offenders found that only 80 out of 300 them were living at the addresses they had given to the authorities. There have also been countless anecdotes of misidentification, vigilante attacks on paedophiles and even suicides of people who have been subjected to public attack after appearing on the websites. A major criticism from opponents of the law change is that dangerous criminals are driven underground to avoid public anger. Surely the British public wouldn't be quite so reactionary? A \"name and shame\" campaign of paedophiles in the News of the World, which published the names and photographs of 49 people it said were child sex offenders living in towns and cities across Britain, stirred up violent outbursts of hatred. Vigilante groups, mainly composed of parents incensed at the idea of having convicted paedophiles living in their area, mounted angry protests outside the suspected sex offenders' houses. Two men accused of child sex offences committed suicide and four innocent families fled their homes in Portsmouth after gossip and rumour wrongly identified them as harbouring paedophiles. Violence flared in Plymouth and Whitely, Berkshire. Innocent men mistaken for paedophiles were targeted in London and Manchester. So what does the British police think? The head of Sussex CID, the force whose work led to Whiting's conviction, warned that such a law would drive sex offenders underground and make them impossible to monitor. The Association of Chief Police Officers and probation officers agree that it would be impossible to control access to information about paedophiles. They warned that vigilante attacks would likely drive sex offenders underground. What about child welfare workers? The NSPCC warned of the dangers of increased vigilante action and \"unforeseen\" effects including making it easier for paedophiles to get in contact with each other. The charity urged the adoption of indeterminate sentences for sex offenders, under which they would not be released until doctors agreed that they were unlikely to strike again. What do ministers think? The Home Office minister, Beverley Hughes, said: \"Protecting children is the highest priority ... we will be studying the details of this case very carefully to make sure we learn from it.\" What is the current system? At present, sex offenders must register their names and address with a designated police station within 72 hours of their release from jail. Failure to register can lead to six-month jail terms or fines. A total of 12,000 people are listed on the sex offenders register, which came into force in 1997. Police can apply for a community protection order, which lasts for a minimum of five years and can bar an individual from areas frequented by children. Head teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others are notified on a confidential basis of the existence of a local sex offender."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
