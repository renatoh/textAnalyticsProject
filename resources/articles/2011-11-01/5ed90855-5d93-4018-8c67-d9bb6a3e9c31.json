At the start, I made an administrative error and paid late. The default has been on my credit file ever since. I did not miss any further payments but this made it difficult to get credit. The Student Loans Company said the only way to clear the default notice was to repay the loan in full. I did this last July, with money I was saving for a mortgage deposit. But the default is still on my file and I cannot get a personal loan for a computer I need for work. AL, London The Student Loans Company blamed a technical error when you paid off your loan for its failure to update your file. It immediately did so manually and has corrected your details with the credit reference agencies.
