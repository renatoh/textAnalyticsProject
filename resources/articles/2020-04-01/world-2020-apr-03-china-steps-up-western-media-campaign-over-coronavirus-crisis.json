Photographs of Chinese aid \u2013 dubbed \u201cfacemask diplomacy\u201d \u2013 arriving at Heathrow on Saturday including boxes labelled \u201cKeep Calm and Cure Coronavirus\u201d have been promoted to UK audiences by the Xinhua news agency. Some younger Chinese diplomats have used English-language Twitter, which is banned within China, to spread false suggestions that the virus may have been started by the west to discredit the Chinese state. Prof Kerry Brown, an associate fellow on the Asia-Pacific programme at the thinktank Chatham House, suggested the country was trying to turn a national disaster into a global triumph: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to push back against some of the politicisation of this in America and to try to get control of the narrative before it spirals out of control.\u201d China\u2019s authoritarian single-party state, which is at the bottom of the World Press Freedom Index and has faced recent claims of playing down its coronavirus infection numbers, has long complained of unfair coverage by western media and recently expelled many western journalists. In recent years it has invested enormous sums of money in its own English-language news infrastructure to project its image around the world. At the forefront of this response has been the state-owned English-language 24-hour rolling news channel CGTN, which recently began broadcasting from a new UK base in west London with a mission statement of \u201creporting the news from a Chinese perspective\u201d. Although CGTN is facing ongoing investigations by the media regulator Ofcom over its impartiality and other issues around press freedom, its criticism of western governments is less overt than that of other state-backed news networks such Russia Today or Iran\u2019s Press TV. Instead, in the past week the channel has broadcast a combination of inspiring individual stories about Chinese doctors saving lives against the odds during the coronavirus pandemic, videos of Chinese aid arriving in European and African nations, and footage of China\u2019s economy already recovering from the lockdown \u2013 along with more unusual footage, such as film of an Ethiopian man who believed he could stop the infection by putting garlic up his nose. On Thursday afternoon, it aired a series of interviews with Chinese diplomats and medical workers across Europe, with a presenter introducing interviews on how \u201cChina\u2019s experience fighting Covid-19 is proving invaluable to other countries trying to contain the crisis\u201d. They also interviewed the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands who criticised western media for their coverage of coronavirus aid: \u201cDo they really wish China to stand by? I believe public opinion in the west is appreciative of China and its help.\u201d Lijian Zhao, a young Chinese diplomat who has been likened to Donald Trump for his outsized and aggressively nationalistic Twitter personality, has also spread links to conspiracy theory websites suggesting the virus may have been created by the US. Zhao is among a group of so-called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats and state media accounts, named after a patriotic film from 2015, that have become more outspoken, especially in defending China\u2019s role in the outbreak. Over the past year, more Chinese diplomats as well as the foreign ministry have joined Twitter, posting in English and promoting China\u2019s perspective on issues from human rights violations in Xinjiang to the US-China trade war. The cybersecurity researchers Recorded Future said they had noticed a distinct shift in tone on Chinese-run social media accounts in mid-February, which sought to move the narrative \u201cfrom China as the source of the pandemic to China as a global leader in its response\u201d. In line with this approach dozens of branded articles from the Chinese state-controlled People\u2019s Daily have appeared on the Daily Telegraph website under a lucrative sponsorship deal, with headlines such as \u201cWhy are some framing China\u2019s heroic efforts to stop coronavirus as inhumane?\u201d Many of these have been removed from the UK newspaper\u2019s website in recent days, in a development first reported by BuzzFeed News. Chinese companies have also done their best to help. Huawei, the telecoms giant at the centre of a global tussle over 5G mobile phone equipment, has donated thousands of facemasks to the UK under the slogan \u201cTogether we support the NHS\u201d. But while the move was applauded by the Apprentice host, Lord Sugar, to his millions of Twitter followers, the company has not promoted its role \u2013 potentially out of concerns of how the gift would be perceived. What is unclear is whether western audiences are being influenced by the Chinese material. CGTN\u2019s viewing figures are not publicly recorded but unlike Russia Today it is not available on the main Freeview broadcast service, while the online audience for Xinhua\u2019s UK Facebook page attracts very few interactions. Brown said there had been surprise in China at some of the negative reaction to donations of masks: \u201cThe Chinese complaint is when you sent aid for earthquakes in the past, we didn\u2019t complain. It\u2019s symptomatic of this cultural clash over news management.\u201d He also said that current English-language campaigns by Chinese state-backed media outlets were still far too conservative in their approach compared with more effective and \u201cinsidious\u201d propaganda efforts by nations such as Russia. \u201cPeople bang on about Chinese influence in the media but it\u2019s too obvious \u2013 it walks down the street on stilts with a big sign above it saying \u2018government messaging\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they get good at it, we won\u2019t know. When they get good at it we have a problem.\u201d France has also become alarmed at attempts by China to use the coronavirus outbreak to project the superiority of its political system. In an internal note, CAPS, the in-house thinktank of the country\u2019s foreign ministry, warned that China would take control of globalisation and future global governance in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak unless democratic states offered something better than sticking-plaster solutions once the crisis had ended. \u201cEven if China cannot claim leadership similar to that which the United States would have assumed a few years ago, China is already occupying the field by making itself essential, even central,\u201d it read.
