A third defeat has ended their interest in the Heineken Cup for another year and Friday's trip to Paris for the return will be academic for the Hertfordshire side. Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez had not played for three months before this match, a thigh injury having kept the great full-back out of Argentina's side for the autumn internationals. Hern\u00e1ndez's move from Paris rivals Stade Francais has been a statement of intent by Racing's president Jacky Lorenzetti and he proved his worth with the try that ultimately decided the game in the first half. Racing are a no-frills side and they won the game through a superior pack, in which their captain, S\u00e9bastien Chabal, was outstanding on his return to England, and a sound game by their kicker Jonathan Wisniewski, little known outside France but who could well be France's fly-half in next year's Six Nations. His opposite number was Owen Farrell, 19 years old, and six months ago a schoolboy. Andy Farrell's son will almost certainly appear for England one day but here he was playing behind a beaten pack. Mark McCall, Saracens' head coach who will take over the team when Brendan Venter returns to South Africa next month, said: \"It was a very physical battle but I thought we did well to get back into the game. We've lost three games but we could have won three and we think we are a Heineken Cup side. We won't now be caving in.\" Saracens had made the perfect start, running up an early eight-point lead. Schalk Brits fielded a high ball in his own half and began a counterattack which ended with David Strettle, who had made a switch to outside-centre, slipping a pass to Noah Cato who brushed aside a weak tackle from Fran\u00e7ois Steyn to dive over. Steyn made amends when he followed a successful kick by Wisniewski with a 50-metre penalty of his own and by the beginning of the second quarter Racing were ahead through a Hern\u00e1ndez try. The French scrum rumbled forward, Chabal charged on and Sireli Bobo chipped to the corner. There seemed little danger but Brad Barritt had a rush of blood to the head and threw a pass back which Hern\u00e1ndez scooped up to score. Saracens changed their entire front row early in the second half. It did them little good and, when one of the replacements, the Italy prop Carlos Nieto, was penalised at his first scrum, Steyn kicked a second penalty from the halfway line. Saracens got a penalty back through Farrell, but Bobo settled matters with a splendid solo score from 40 yards after evading three tackles, after which Racing wound down the clock at a ruck, leaving their hosts with a bonus point that will simply not be enough to matter when this pool is finally resolved in late January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
