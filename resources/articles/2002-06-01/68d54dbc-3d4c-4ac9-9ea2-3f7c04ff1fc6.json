Lennox Lewis is without any doubt the best heavyweight in the world and can revel in the full meaning of the word which ranks so highly as his motivation for achievement, namely \"respect\". After knocking out Mike Tyson in eight rounds here in Tennessee, he has it all. \"He was splendid, a masterful boxer, and I just take my hat off to him,\" said Tyson in a moving after-fight interview. He reached out to dab a bead of blood or perspiration from below the champion's bruised left eye and added: \"I've known Lennox for 15 or 16 years; I have mad respect. Everything I said was in proposition of promoting the fight. And if he thinks I don't have respect and don't love him, he's crazy.\" Tyson's tribute came after a quite magnificent performance from the champion. At 36 Lewis may not be quite the man he once was but his victory left no note of controversy. Tyson was counted out, flat on his back, in an old-fashioned knockout, ending all theories that he could somehow regain the glorious brutality of his youth. Of course, cynics will be quick to say Tyson was a hollow shell of what he once was and that, like Joe Louis against Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes, he was badly beaten when past his prime. But it should be remembered that many experts had sided with Tyson. Evander Holyfield, Glenn McCrory, Duke McKenzie and others all said his style would be the decisive factor, that he would be able to destroy Lewis at close range and that his right fist would inevitably detonate on Lewis's fragile chin. Instead Lewis dictated terms, coping with all except the earliest Tyson attacks with wonderful dexterity and mobility before delivering the final rapier thrust, a thunderous right hook, in the eighth round. \"I showed boxing who's the best in the world,\" said Lewis. \"A lot of people thought he was going to get away from my jab, but nobody gets away from my jab. What more do you guys want me to do? A lot of people felt that Mike Tyson was the same as he was years ago, but I deal in reality. \"I'm glad no foul play was in the fight. It's been a great long road and I've finally completed what I wanted to do.\" Lewis's last step along the journey to securing what he believes to be his legacy was in doubt only during a dramatic opening round when Tyson landed two crunching lefts, one of which rocked back Lewis's head and briefly stiffened his legs. But Tyson was never able to put together the lightning-fast combinations he delivered so brilliantly in his prime. Lewis weathered the storm, landing heavy left jabs and uppercuts to repel his willing but inadequate opponent. \"Some of those punches I caught him on the right side he took like a man,\" said Lewis. \"I was shocked he was able to take them, because I felt them right through my hand.\" Ultimately, it was little more than pride which kept Tyson moving forward in the face of the Lewis bombs. He took some punches of frightening power but, brave though he was, from the fourth round the contest amounted to little more than target practice for Lewis. Tyson pleaded for a rematch and, if the American TV companies HBO and ShowTime want it, it could happen, although Lewis, the World Boxing Council, International Boxing Organisation and International Boxing Federation champion, is likely to continue first with a low-risk defence against the IBF's mandatory challenger Chris Byrd. Outstanding though Lewis was, this will never be viewed as a great fight because this particular vintage of Tyson was eclipsed. Whether the Tyson of 1988 would have prevailed is a moot point, but that variant of Iron Mike has been consigned to history. \"Lennox kept Mike at range with his jab and fought him where he wanted him. It was brilliant,\" said Lewis's trainer Emanuel Steward. \"When Lennox fights like that, he could have lived with any heavyweight in history. He has now proved he should be judged as probably the best fighter since Muhammad Ali.\" The defeat was a bitter pill for Tyson but the old champion showed no little class and perhaps found partial redemption for his misdemeanours in the ring in recent years. Meanwhile Lewis will take time to assess his options. The self-styled lion and \"pugilist specialist\" is the king of all he surveys, rightly able to take as long as he likes to consider what, if anything, comes next in his boxing life. Respect. What next for Lewis? 1. CHRIS BYRD The IBF has said it will strip Lewis of its belt if he does not face the awkward southpaw. Byrd, the IBF's No1 challenger, is a light-hitting spoiler who has been beaten by Vladimir Klitschko and has no drawing power in America. Lewis's TV backer HBO would not be keen but a safety-first defence might appeal as Lewis makes his plans for retirement. Likelihood factor 8/10 2. EVANDER HOLYFIELD The four-times champion beat Hasim Rahman in Atlantic City on June 1 and says it is his destiny to be champion again. But Lewis has already fought him twice and would have had two victories if their first meeting had not been scored controversially as a draw. Punters may not buy it and Lewis is not keen to go in again with the 39-year-old king of the head-butt. 3/10 3. JOHN RUIZ WBA champion due to fight the Canadian Kirk Johnson. A match between the winner and Lewis is an option but would mean dealing with Don King. The unification concept may appeal to Lewis, especially as he would expect to beat both men easily. King would be prepared to pay handsomely to get the rights and options to keep the heavyweight title in his control. 7/10 4. VLADIMIR KLITSCHKO Probably the hardest test for Lewis. The Ukrainian man-mountain is the WBO champion and a huge draw in Germany where he is based. He is hard to sell in the US but will raise his profile if he beats Lewis's former opponent Ray Mercer this month. Vladimir's older brother Vitali, similarly colossal but less talented, will also be considered. 5/10 5. MIKE TYSON Iron Mike pleaded for another chance in the ring after the fight in Memphis but Lewis won so emphatically that it is hard to believe this would be a credible match. Does Tyson have any currency as a genuine title challenger? Highly doubtful while Lewis is around. 3/10 6. RETIREMENT Lewis has made his money, beaten all the top challengers and earned the right to call himself the finest heavyweight of his era. With little left to achieve, some in his camp are saying he should quit now; why risk taking a beating? His mother Violet, an ever-present figure, is sure to have her say and may urge her son to walk away from fighting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
