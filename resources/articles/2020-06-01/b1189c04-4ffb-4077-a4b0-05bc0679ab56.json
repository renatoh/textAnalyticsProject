But at least one person was unhappy with Brees\u2019s decision to change the play at the line. Donald Trump took aim at the future Hall of Fame signal-caller on Friday afternoon, saying on Twitter: \u201cI am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he\u2019s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high... We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!\u201d The US president\u2019s broadside came less than 24 hours after Brees posted an Instagram video in which he promised to \u201cdo better\u201d following widespread criticism over a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance in which he said he \u201cwill never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States\u201d. The comments, which came in the wake of widespread civil unrest in the US after the police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, sparked immediate backlash. Brees\u2019s teammate Michael Thomas wrote in a subsequent post on social media: \u201cWe don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t agree and whoever else how about that.\u201d Another of Brees\u2019s teammates, Malcolm Jenkins, posted a video to social media in which he became emotional as he said the quarterback did not understand that for many black people in America the flag represents centuries of oppression. Stars from other sports also joined in with the criticism. LeBron James, arguably the most high-profile athlete in America, posted his thoughts on Twitter. \u201cYou literally still don\u2019t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee??\u201d wrote the LA Lakers star. \u201cHas absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of [America] and our soldiers (men and women) who keep our land free. My father-in-law was one of those.\u201d Ever since claiming at a 2016 rally that any player who knelt during the anthem was a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and should be fired, Trump has not shied away from co-opting American sports as a primary theater in the culture wars reflective a country\u2019s deep divides. He\u2019s waged media battles with the NBA\u2019s Stephen Curry and LeBron James over his decision to rescind the Golden State Warriors\u2019 unaccepted invitation for the White House visit traditionally extended to championship-winning teams, and twice called out LaVar Ball, the father of a UCLA basketball player detained for shoplifting in China, as \u201cungrateful\u201d for the president\u2019s help in resolving the imbroglio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
