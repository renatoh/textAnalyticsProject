In a briefing document circulated to more than 100 Labour MPs and peers yesterday, Watson says sections of the analysis leaked to the media have \u201cskewed\u201d understanding of the party\u2019s plight. He warns that if Labour does not face the actual lessons and become a Remain party, it risks electoral disaster. In his memo, obtained by the Observer, he challenges five of the key points made to the shadow cabinet in the briefing, which cast doubt on the benefits of Labour becoming a more explicitly pro-Remain party. Watson warns that unless Labour grasps the reality of its position, it faces a \u201ccatastrophic loss of votes\u201d to the Liberal Democrats and Greens \u201cthat could enable a Conservative landslide\u201d at a general election. His intervention comes ahead of further discussion at the shadow cabinet on Tuesday of Labour\u2019s Brexit position. After last week\u2019s meeting, the party issued a statement that disappointed supporters of a second referendum and appeared to leave Labour\u2019s nuanced position on another public vote unchanged, while not committing the party to a clear pro-Remain stance. Watson is concerned that accounts of last week\u2019s meeting released to the media misrepresented the full picture, fundamentally underplaying the extent of the loss of votes from Labour to Remain parties, while overplaying the danger to the party of adopting a more pro-Remain policy in key seats that backed Leave in the 2016 referendum. Watson says accounts of the shadow cabinet analysis \u201cmay have skewed understanding within the media, the party and the shadow cabinet about the huge challenge confronting Labour\u201d. In a message to his Future Britain group of MPs and peers, which is backing its own centre-left set of policy approaches, he says: \u201cMany people in this group have contacted me following the Brexit shadow cabinet that took place this week and ahead of the key shadow cabinet that will next week decide the future of Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit, and in particular whether the party will campaign to remain in a referendum on any future deal. \u201cJeremy has already committed Labour to holding a confirmatory public ballot on any future Brexit deal, whether the deal is negotiated by the Tories or by Labour. That is the right thing to do. What is yet to be decided is if Labour should campaign for Remain in that referendum. It is my firm belief that we should. The majority of Labour\u2019s members and voters are Remain. Our hearts are Remain and our values are Remain.\u201d He adds: \u201cNext week will be a historic moment for our party. If we get the decision wrong, I fear we could become electoral history.\u201d On Sunday, the former Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett called on Corbyn to repeat the approach used by then Labour prime minister Harold Wilson in 1975 by calling a referendum but allowing his top team to campaign as they wish. Writing for the Observer online, Beckett says: \u201cJeremy Corbyn is now said to be studying the history of the 1970s as he grapples with this problem. Labour can and should back a referendum on any Brexit outcome. And, if we get such a vote, I think it is inevitable that Labour will once more support staying in the EU because the idea that we can secure a deal that will satisfy \u2013 rather than impoverish \u2013 our voters, has long since been exposed as a fantasy. \u201cThose who still insist they want to leave could, if they wish, campaign alongside Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in such a referendum. Jeremy himself could take a back seat in the campaign, as Harold did in 1975. What matters now is that Labour moves with speed to close the gap that has opened up between party\u2019s position on the one hand \u2013 and its members, voters and values on the other. \u201cIf we do this in the next few weeks we can still change the course of history. If we don\u2019t, we risk becoming history ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
