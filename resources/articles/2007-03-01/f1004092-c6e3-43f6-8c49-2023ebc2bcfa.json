Now, while I still volunteer in my local Oxfam bookshop, I've been to Albania, fallen in love with the country, and find myself committed to raising \u00a314,000 to build a bridge in one of the small villages I visited during my trip. While, of course, keeping up my 'day job' as a PhD student in Oxford, and trying to maintain a semblance of a social life. It's been a year since the project started and so far I've raised just over \u00a32,000. It isn't bad, especially considering it's almost entirely made up of small donations from individuals, but it's not amazing, either. I'd be lying if I didn't say I had seriously underestimated the magnitude of what I was taking on. \u00a314,000 is not a huge amount of money, but it is definitely not insignificant either. This is not an urgent disaster featured prominently in the media, but a very basic need of one village amongst many needing support. How did this begin? A year and a half ago, I applied for one of Oxfam's communication and exposure tours, in which staff and volunteers are selected to spend two weeks in one of the countries where Oxfam projects are under way. This allows us to learn more about the organisation's work and witness first-hand how the money and time donated are put to use. The Albania trip put my shop volunteering in a new perspective, and the people we met in each village showed such resilience and determination to make the most of the opportunities Oxfam was offering them. One day's visit was particularly hard to shake off, to the village of Ure e Shtrenjte, near Shkoder in northern Albania, where Oxfam helped set up a beekeeping and honeymaking cooperative. We were welcomed so warmly, all crowding around a table sharing photos and stories, and eating just-fried rralle (puffy dough fritters) dunked in the cooperative's honey. The village is set at the foot of the mountains and cut in two by a gorge, which at the moment is crossed by a narrow metal plank. When the snow melts and swells the river, the waters rise so high as to engulf the bridge, cutting off one half of the village from the rest of the world, since the only road out is on the other side. This can go on for weeks or months. I'd seen in person how badly a bridge was needed, and it couldn't be so hard to raise the money, could it? It needn't be very big, and anyway Oxford is full of rich people who won't mind another charity appeal, I thought. I signed a contract with Oxfam, and its staff in Albania undertook supervision of the work. My friend and fellow traveller Christian Guthier helped set up a website (albaniabridge.co.uk), and off I went to find \u00a314,000. I discovered fundraising takes a lot of effort, patience, and inventiveness in trying to figure out which potential sources and contacts you have not yet looked into. And if you can only give it limited time, often you will get only limited results. It can get very, very discouraging. For every ten letters or emails you write, maybe one will have some effect. There are days when you just want to give up, because you feel you'll never reach your target. Despite the recurring disappointments, I don't regret it at all. The frustration, the anxiety about not being able to honour my commitment, the annoyance of devoting large chunks of my evenings and weekends to writing letters rather than hanging out with my housemates - it all pales in comparison with the great things that have come out of this experience so far. I've met lots of inspiring people, both personally and through the website. I've received lots of touching messages of support from the Albanian community all over the world. I've certainly learnt a lot about fundraising, and how useful the web can be. Blogs, forums and portal sites are one of my most reliable sources of publicity and support, and of course having our own website is crucial. The whole process has been an incredibly steep learning curve, but nevertheless full of satisfactions. One year on, I'm still not quite sure how I fell into this, and why it drives me so. But I do know that, whatever it takes, in a few months' time I want to be in Ure e Shtrenjte cutting the ribbon to that bridge. And they'd better have lots of rralle waiting for me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
