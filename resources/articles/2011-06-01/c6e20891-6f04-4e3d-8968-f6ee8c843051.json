Posters for the campaign, launched today, feature a well-heeled man in a pinstripe suit outside his large country pile, with the words: \"Their lawns or our jobs\". The adverts will be run across buses, trains and transport hubs in the north-west and north-east of England. It was described as the beginning of a \"significant shift\" in the Campaign for High Speed Rail before the end of public consultation in 43 days' time. The campaign is an independent body composed of civil society groups alongside businesses including Morrisons, Greggs, Goldman Sachs and the leaderships of the main northern cities. It was reported in the Sunday Times that even the Queen is concerned about the proposed route of the \u00a334bn HS2 line. Prince Andrew was said by the newspaper to have raised the issue with Treasury officials last year on account of his mother's concern that passing trains would upset her horses at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire, which hosts the Royal Show and 200 other events each year. [See footnote.] A source for the campaign said: \"The message... I think highlights the frustration felt in large parts of the country that a very small number of well-funded Nimbys may be able to derail a scheme that will do so much good to so many people in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and elsewhere.\" The route was announced by transport secretary Philip Hammond in December and will get passengers from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes. The government was revealed last week to have offered some \u00a320m in compensation to those homeowners affected by the route. \u2022 This footnote was appended on 22 June 2011. Since publication, the Guardian has been contacted by the press office of the Duke of York. A spokesman there said \"It is not correct that the Duke of York raised the issue of HS2 and its impact on horses at Stoneleigh Park at a briefing at the Treasury last November... The Duke of York did not make any representation, or voice any opinion, on behalf of the Queen.\" \u2022 The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday 3 July 2011. In this article we said Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire was the scene of the annual Royal Show. This event actually ceased in 2009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
