No risk of Blair going that way", "bodyText": "Tony Blair and his people are dismayed that Al Gore won't be president. His failure leaves them with a chasm to cross in Washington. But they were appalled by Gore's campaign. As they open their own four-month election, that is of more searing importance. They think Gore blew it, and are determined not to follow his example. The lesson they learned, however, is not what seems to be generally assumed. Yes, Gore stupidly declined to put the economy at the centre. He was handed a perfect set of cards: high growth, high employment, low inflation, buoyant markets. Vanity restrained him from playing them every day. The economy, he thought, was Clinton's. He wanted to win without Clinton. He thought Clinton stank in many states, which in a religious nation was true. But even where Clinton didn't stink, Gore thought Gore alone must win. If one more middle-sized state had gone his way, we would never have heard of Florida chads. But he didn't take it. Mr Blair and Mr Brown won't make in any way the same mistake. They may nurture rival vanities, but not on this issue. They sink or swim together on the record of economic competence. That's not the critique of Gore that touches them. What they really condemn Gore for is desertion of the cause they shared with Clinton: the social centrism of the third way, balancing liberalism with \"responsibility\" and right with left. Gore became a bit of a lefty. In six months he spoke to more labour union audiences than Blair has in six years. He launched heavy attacks on big business, notably the health insurance industry but also big oil and other heavy-sucking leeches on the US tax base. He cultivated sectional interest groups, especially the blacks and the poor. Within the decorous limits American politics permits, and not forgetting the funds he needed from top people, he fought a class-based campaign. This, New Labour thinks, is how Gore lost - if he did lose, but that's another question. He abandoned the gospel of third wayers, which tells them to avoid the old politics of class. What Clinton and Blair shared, Gore partly ditched, thereby imperilling a constituency that Clinton and his friends at the Democratic Leadership Council had spent a decade building. In a country where the turn-out is low, barely 50%, he reckoned he needed his core constituency more than any other. It did not work out like that. One interpretation of New Labour is that it is now moving the same way. It promises huge boosts in public spending. After the two-year standstill, public services are back in political vogue. Mr Blair appears to be rediscovering his roots, and Mr Brown is feeding them the nutrition he has always believed they need. This, it's said, is Labour's pre-election plan. In addition, they're spending a lot of political capital on sectional voters with the right progressive attitude, whether pro-gay or anti-hunt. But this is far from replicating Gore. Blair, in particular, rejects Goreism. The so-called core vote is not, in Britain, the problem. For a start, who exactly makes up this core? While it is true that some of it will not vote at all, and may therefore create a turnout problem, the people who remain a lot more interesting to Labour than the lifelong Labour vote are those who never voted Labour before 1997 but gave the party its huge majority. Sustaining Labour's credibility as a non-class party, with as much to offer business as working people, is the way it is most determined to do this. It's a judgment from which Blair will never now deviate. Heavy public spending, on the long road to an acceptable standard of public services, is consistent with this. It is as much a demand of new Labour voters as of old. The comprehensive spending review wasn't in any way sectional or distinctively leftwing. It has defined the main battleground of the election. As William Hague made clear yesterday, in the first of the wearisome chain of statistical exchanges that will leave voters entirely baffled between now and May, there is consensus at least about that. The parties are competing about whose public spending will be the more efficient, not about whether it should be spent at all. The Tories have fought shy of making this a contest about ideology. It is entirely about delivery. But Labour, also, avoids its own recognisable ideology. Unlike Al Gore, Tony Blair will not demonise any particle of capitalism. Bits of the core vote might want that, but it won't happen. While he rails against the forces of conservatism, Blair regards capitalism not as an enemy but as his ally in the struggle, an agent of change cutting through barnacles. Since he became leader of his party, he has not, I believe, made a single attack on big business in the vein Gore adopted repeatedly last October. There was a moment when he might have done so, as the oil companies were refusing to run fuel protesters' blockades to keep the country moving. But press conferences at the time found the prime minister not mountainously enraged so much as mute with timorous incomprehension. He could never imagine taking on big business in open conflict. Professor Colin Crouch considers some of the implications of this bondage in a stimulating new pamphlet, Coping with Post-democracy, which makes some links between the decline of the state and the waning of democratic enthusiasm. When so much of the public sector has been handed over to private operators, Crouch argues, what becomes of the image of government as a task that matters? If every public function is tested by its conformity with private-sector management goals, why should anyone get excited about choosing between parties? If government is routinely seen as incompetent, and the company as the only source of expertise, no wonder politics and democracy, in America if not yet here, are at an all-time low. This is a fate that Labour, not so long ago, would have been desperate to avoid. For New Labour the priority is a little different. Crouch suggests that, as the Tories collapse, Labour could even become the business choice. \"In that scenario a movement which had been constructed by the labours of ordinary working people and their sympathisers for over a century would have been hijacked by hostile interests who had themselves trashed their own party.\" At some stage, the Labour party may have to confront the lacuna that has been created on the left. The need for social protection against the vagaries of the market and the anti-communal values of global corporations will demand a political party to turn them into issues of political concern. Gore didn't go that far. But Blairism, at this stage of its evolution, will get nowhere near. The third way is still far more preoccupied with efficiency than with justice and believes that this is, among other things, the way to win. I fear it is right. For the moment. \u0095Colin Crouch, Coping with Post-democracy, Fabian Society \u00a36.95. hugoyoung@compuserve.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
