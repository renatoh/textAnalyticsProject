The silence is only punctuated by the whir of the mechanical rabbit spinning around the track, the flurry of the greyhounds footsteps and the relentless drone of country and western music. \u201cI can remember going to Wentworth Park and you couldn\u2019t move before the TAB come in,\u201d says Ron Johnston, an 86-year-old truck driver who lives across the road. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t go now, if it\u2019s raining and wet you\u2019re not going to go down there, [it is] only the owners and trainers.\u201d Inside the stadium there are as many reporters as there are punters, because this occasion is the first race night at the track since New South Wales premier Mike Baird announced that the sport would be banned in the state next year. Before racing starts, a spokesperson for the Greyhound Breeders Owners and Trainers Association encourages the trainers to share their story with the journalists, sign a petition, and write letters to their local MP. The inquiry commissioned by the NSW government that provoked the ban found that \u201caround 10% to 20% of trainers\u201d were engaged in the practice of live baiting, and that the wastage rate of greyhounds is \u201c70% to 50%\u201d. Johnston used to train greyhounds. He stopped a few years ago, but admits he has used rabbits as live bait, and that \u201call the trainers\u201d have done it. \u201cWe did give them a rabbit, but that\u2019s all,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce the greyhound would grab the rabbit it would die, you know. I don\u2019t believe in [live baiting with] cats and possums and things like that. I\u2019ve never ever done that.\u201d Judith and John Richardson have been married for 51 years, and have raced greyhounds for the past 45. At their home in Dapto they have three pups, two racing dogs and two more in retirement. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the money to be horse trainers,\u201d says Mrs Richardson. \u201cYou can race a dog, it can turn out here and it can be a champion.\u201d They Richardsons usually race at country tracks, but since the beginning of this year, they have been entering dogs at the races at Wentworth Park in Sydney. The Wentworth Park website says that it is \u201cthe most affordable and easiest code of racing to become involved in as an owner.\u201d As to the reasons for the ban, Mrs Richardson says: \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen a bad side of this industry.\u201d Rod Moon, a storeman and regular punter, says he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the ban, which will come into force on 1 July 2017, but readily admits that live baiting is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been resigned to [Wentworth Park] going, I\u2019m surprised this didn\u2019t go five years ago, maybe 10 years ago,\u201d says Moon. \u201cI feel sorry for the Gosfords, the Daptos and the Bathursts.\u201d Then there\u2019s Bob Shirley, a 73 year-old semi-retired accountant, has sold tickets at the Wattle Street end for the past four years. He too says that live baiting is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, but adds that the trainers he knows are \u201cterrific people\u201d who \u201cdote on their dogs\u201d. \u201cIt has to be properly policed,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you know this is going on, you\u2019ve got to become a dobber. It won\u2019t be popular, of course, but there you go. If you want an industry, it has to happen.\u201d These are the \u201cbattlers\u201d that have invested money and time into a sport that the NSW Labor opposition leader, Luke Foley, has called a \u201cgreat Australian institution\u201d. Foley has formed an unlikely coalition with the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and the Reverend Fred Nile in opposition to the Baird government\u2019s decision to ban greyhound racing. Class has become a focal point in the debate. Foley has urged National party MPs to stand up to \u201celitist north shore liberals and inner-city Greens\u201d, while Max Solling, a local historian, told ABC Radio: \u201cThere\u2019s been a long history of dog racing being singled out for discriminatory treatment, both here and in Britain. The middle-class society particularly was always ready to attack greyhound racing.\u201d The Richardson\u2019s greyhound, Ace I Am \u2014 named after the rapper Will.I.Am \u2014 finishes third in Race 7. John lets the dog out of the starting box, and Judith gathers it at the end of the race. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d says Mrs Richardson. \u201cWe can\u2019t pack up and go to another state. We\u2019ve got grandchildren, we\u2019ve got our kids, what\u2019s our life going to be? I don\u2019t know what John and I are going to do. \u201cIt will break our hearts if we have to stop racing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
