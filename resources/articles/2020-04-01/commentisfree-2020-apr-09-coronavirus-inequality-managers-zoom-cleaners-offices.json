Rich or poor, we have all been plunged into turmoil, insecurity and isolation, bonded together by our inability to imagine what life will be like in two weeks, let alone two months. Tell that to Jhon, a 46-year-old chef at the Warrington Hotel, a plush pub in the leafy west London district of Maida Vale. On 18 March, he and two kitchen porters were sent a letter from their bosses announcing \u201csome extremely difficult decisions\u201d had to be made that meant their positions had \u201cbeen made redundant\u201d. No furlough, no 80% wage subsidy for his \u00a310-an-hour pay packet; a man with four children to support has been thrown into extreme hardship. It gets worse. Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law. When their trade union, the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), asked the pub\u2019s owners why the workers were being dismissed \u201cdespite having the ability to pay the wages and its bills after the government\u2019s help package\u201d and announced legal action, the only reply they received was \u201cNoted\u201d. What does he feel when we\u2019re told \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d, I ask him. \u201cI feel angry, it\u2019s just not true,\u201d Jhon tells me through a translator: he is a migrant worker from Colombia. \u201cThe owners of the hotels and the other businesses are only looking for profit, leaving everyone else unprotected. They don\u2019t care about us.\u201d He\u2019s always been a responsible, loyal employee, he says, since he started working at the pub seven months ago. Now he feels angry, helpless, \u201cshocked at the lack of humanity by these people at the top\u201d, worried about rent, bills, and \u201csimple things like buying food\u201d. Coronavirus is not some grand leveller: it is an amplifier of existing inequalities, injustices and insecurities. We hear the constant invoking of the second world war: but despite the horror of Nazi bombs, the living standards and health of poorer Britons benefited from rationing and full employment. In the age of Covid-19, the rubble of economic collapse will fall on those who suffered the most from the last crash: the young, the precarious, the low-paid. If you are wealthy, you have savings; you may own your property outright, or at least have relief in the form of a mortgage holiday. Renters on the other hand, who even in normal times part with a huge portion of their wage bills, now have the National Residential Landlords Association wagging its fingers in their faces, telling them that the pandemic is not a \u201cgreen light\u201d for them not to pay their rent. Many find themselves asking what exactly they\u2019re meant to pay their rent with. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes, the better-off may actually increase their savings as spending on forbidden activities falls; but poorer households spend much more of their limited income on necessities, leaving them vulnerable to sudden falls in their incomings. Indeed, millions who spend their lives treading water now face being sucked under by strong currents. The wealthy are also more likely to be able to work from home. In the United States, a study of mobile data reveals that the wealthy are moving around less than the least well-off: they can afford to self-isolate and did so quicker than their poorer fellow citizens. As the New York Times headline aptly put it: \u201cLocation Data Say It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury\u201d. It is no different here, of course: while managers conduct high-powered meetings on Zoom, their cleaners still travel across cities on early-morning buses to clean half-empty offices. Then there\u2019s the issue of space. While many middle-class children play in expansive gardens, much of the urban poor find themselves locked away in overcrowded accommodation, risking a police reprimand if they loiter around parks. Those with violent partners or abusive parents, or, for LGBTQ youth, all too often hostile families, have nowhere to go. For some, home is a sanctuary; for others, it was a place of fear before the pandemic, and now it is a prison. Finally, nurses, care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers are rightly designated the title of \u201ckey worker\u201d, but what compensation for years of being undervalued, underpaid and now at particular risk of exposure to a potentially lethal illness. So save us the platitudes of coronavirus as the great leveller; abandon this sickly myth that we are all in this together. For some, this is a time of grand inconvenience, of undoubted stress, of a self-evident loss of freedom. For others, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away. The BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis was rightly lauded last night for debunking the myth that coronavirus is a great leveller. That it went viral shows the popular appetite there is not to whitewash our grotesque social inequalities. As the IWGB\u2019s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee put it in a letter to Jhon\u2019s employers at Golden Brick Pubs: \u201cHistory will look back on this moment, and those who had the means but nevertheless failed to do everything possible to assist and protect the most vulnerable, will be judged harshly.\u201d When the pandemic is over, when a vaccine shields us from this cruel disease, the rich will still prosper, while the struggling and insecure will be expected to pay: they already are. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
