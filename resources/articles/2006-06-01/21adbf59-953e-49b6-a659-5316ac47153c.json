It is eight years since a British female last reached the fourth round, Sam Smith getting there after upsetting the former champion Conchita Martinez in the third round. Since then, Elena Baltacha, whose promising career has been blighted by illness and injury, is the only British player to have won more than one match in the same year, her passage to the third round in 2002 having included a victory over the seeded South African Amanda Coetzer. This year, Britain's five females in the qualifying all failed to progress, only Jane O'Donoghue winning a match, and those who will be competing all do so courtesy of the wildcard system. Anne Keothavong (Hackney, London) Age 22 Brit ranking 1 World ranking 143 Re-established as British number one, she won the eleventh ITF Women's Circuit title of her career in Jersey this year. Appearing in her sixth Wimbledon, she will hope to rekindle the form of 2004, when she beat world number 41 Nicole Pratt of Australia before losing to eventual champion Maria Sharapova. Katie O'Brien (Hessle, North Humberside) Age 20 Brit ranking 3 Eorld ranking 235 She reached the last four in the ITF Women's Circuit event in Sunderland and achieved her highest career ranking of 227 this year. Having been drawn against Kim Clijsters last year, she will be hoping for better fortune against Tathiana Garbin of Italy in the first round this year. Sarah Borwell (Cheltenham) Age 26 Brit ranking 4 World ranking 249 A late developer, she progressed through the US college system to win her first professional title this year. Her confidence will have been helped by the hard-fought win over Sweden's Nadja Roma in the final of the ITF Women's Circuit tournament in Sheffield. Melanie South (New Malden, Surrey) Age 20 Brit ranking 6 World ranking 302 After winning the ITF Women's Circuit event in Hull, she defeated the former British number one Elena Baltacha in Jersey and will realise a lifelong ambition by appearing in the first round at Wimbledon. Naomi Cavaday (Chislehurst, Kent) Age 17 Brit ranking 12 World ranking 505 Perhaps the nearest we come to a genuine prospect. Britain's junior number one won a senior event on the ITF Women's Circuit in India at the end of last year and has added some eye-catching results on the same circuit this year. She secured her place in the Wimbledon main draw by winning the LTA wildcard play-offs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
