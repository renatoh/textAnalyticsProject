Since the day she was born I have been consumed by an overwhelming love for her, which sometimes feels almost hard to bear. I find myself always wanting to hold on to her, nervous to take her to public places, and most nights I only half sleep, worried that something might happen to her. My impending return to work date is looming over me, and the idea of an eight-hour day during which I can\u2019t touch her, soothe her, hold her, feels like ... well I don\u2019t even have the words. I want to raise her to be resilient and strong, but I don\u2019t feel like I am modelling that at all at the moment. I don\u2019t want the volume of love in my life to change at all \u2013 I just want to have the strength to wrestle with it a bit more. Sometimes when fear starts pacing around us we let it eat a little of our lives. We give it what we think it wants, like it\u2019s hungry and this will make it hush: I\u2019ll get up to check the baby one more time, I\u2019ll ring the doctor to make sure, I\u2019ll google symptoms just this once. It takes many people a lot longer than it\u2019s taken you to realise that sometimes the more you try to sate a fear the more of you it wants to eat. The bad news is you won\u2019t be able to entirely get rid of it. There\u2019s no way around the fact that a life with attachments is a life with worry. You adore your baby girl in the way Elizabeth Stone was talking about when she said to be a parent is \u201cto have your heart go walking outside your body\u201d. And the more we adore someone, the more gut-liquefying we find the thought that something might happen to them. But I hope there\u2019s a kind of relief in remembering that it\u2019s not possible that something will happen: it\u2019s certain. Your daughter will get sick, and she\u2019ll get lost, and some dumb love will make her cry. She\u2019ll get stuck one night without her wallet and she\u2019ll get bad haircuts and you\u2019ll have fights. It\u2019s so easy to look at the blank slate of a newborn and think that if nobody makes any sudden movements they could stay unhurt forever. But there is no timeline like that; bad things will happen. And that\u2019s OK. You wouldn\u2019t want it any other way, because being hurt is what bends us into the shapes we\u2019re proud of being. It\u2019s the price we pay for admission to a life where we get to eat fairy bread and learn what butterflies are and hold hands with people we like in the pocket of a jacket in the cold. Whatever goes wrong for her, she will find something glowing in the middle of it, because the ways that things go wrong will be hers, and because you\u2019ve already kept her safe in the biggest way you can, her mum will be there with her. In the meantime, fear lives in the body, and you can do a surprising amount to curb it by meeting it there. Exercise hard, if you can. A lot of anxiety withers on the other side of physical exertion. Wrap yourself up in tight comfy things, really swaddle yourself. And hold on with everything you\u2019ve got to the reminder that it\u2019s not your job to protect her from everything. It is not a referendum on your parenting when things go wrong. You don\u2019t have to starve the fear entirely, but don\u2019t let it starve you. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?
