Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, has launched the widest ever consultation of Britain's tourism industry in the hope that Britain will enjoy a \u00a32bn bonanza in six years' time. The government hopes to build on the lessons of Germany 2006, which adopted the slogan \"A time to make friends\" and where the hospitality of the host nation was universally praised. London taxi-drivers, as well as hotel receptionists and waiting staff in restaurants, are likely to be enlisted as unofficial \"Olympic ambassadors\" to improve the British tourist industry's image. Recent research showed Britain suffers from negative perceptions including being unwelcoming and providing poor service. The consultation document published yesterday seeks to change that image at a time when \"London and Britain will be the biggest shop window in the world. It will be an opportunity to showcase London as a city, and Britain as a nation\". Options include \"improving the quality of the personal welcome afforded to visitors by offering people on the front line, such as taxi-drivers, the incentives and necessary support to act as effective 'Olympic ambassadors'.\" The idea might extend to language lessons, following the examples of Athens and Sydney where taxi-drivers were taught how to greet visitors in a range of languages. Jowell was speaking at the first 2012 UK-wide business summit at Leeds town hall, an event designed to show how the nation and not only London should benefit from the Games. She said: \"Athens, Sydney and Atlanta have already shown what holding the Games can do for tourism. With the right planning I hope we can better even their impressive records and deliver real long-term benefits.\" In addition to increased numbers of visitors - which could generate an extra \u00a32bn in tourism income - the summit heard that cities around the country could benefit from being advance training-camp venues for the 200 nations and 17,000 athletes in the run-up to the Olympics. Lord Marshall, chairman of Visit Britain, said it had aspirations to be a \u00a3100bn-a-year industry. \"It is blindingly obvious that outstanding opportunities abound for us all,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
