There is a lot of new funding up for grabs for the talkative researcher. Last week, the Office of Science and Technology announced it is offering up \u00a31.2m for scientists eager to talk about their work. Writing the grants off as easy publicity for that popular science book you just sent off to the printers would be a mistake. To get to the cash, you will have to show a genuine interest in what the public wants from science, and not just the other way around. The OST's Sciencewise scheme will focus on areas of science where there has been, or where there is expected to arise, friction between scientists and the public. Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and the use of animals in research are some key issues. Climate change and security issues related to the internet are others. Sciencewise grants will pay 50% of ambitious science communication projects. The rest will have to be found elsewhere. The scope of projects has to involve at least two organisations and be of national interest. A simple one-off exhibition, meeting or show is not good enough. The majority of the \u00a31.2m will go to projects that encourage dialogue with the public. The word \"dialogue\" is key. Simply teaching the public about science will not do. The maximum length for any grant will be three years. Also, nearly \u00a3200,000 will be earmarked for projects to help the government to identify contentious issues before they explode on to the news agenda. But if you are a whizz at engaging the public already and think your colleagues could use some help, you could make a difference with the \u00a3120,000 that will be set aside to support activities that share best practice. This money will also be spent on projects that improve the coverage of science in the news, so if you feel strongly about the way your subject is portrayed in the media, this could be a way to do something about it. Projects supported by the Sciencewise scheme are expected to cost between \u00a320,000 and \u00a3200,000. The total budget available for the first round of funding, with a deadline in November, is \u00a3700,000. If such large-scale projects seem overwhelming, a soft start could be made by nominating yourself for the Royal Society's new Kohn Award for scientists who engage with the public. One lucky winner will receive a \u00a32,500 prize plus \u00a37,500 to spend on science communication activities. The award will be based on the quality of communication activities the nominee has already taken part in. Nominees should have spent between five and 20 years in a scientific career. The deadline is October 15. Communicating science may not earn you a Nobel Prize, or get you the grant that would allow you to spend all your time on the research you love. But it will make you popular with vice-chancellors and research council chiefs who are under pressure to show that the public is involved in the science process. And it is the only way you can help to ensure that in 10 years' time those things you always dreamt of doing will be legal. \u00b7 Linda Nordling is a reporter on Research Fortnight. ln@researchresearch.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
