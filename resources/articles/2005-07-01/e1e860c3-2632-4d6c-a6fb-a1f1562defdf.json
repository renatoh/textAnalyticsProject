Israeli troops re-entered the West Bank town of Tulkarem in response to the attack. Security for the town had been handed over to the Palestinian Authority last month. Two Palestinians were killed in yesterday's operation, and the army also banned Palestinians from entering Israeli territory or travelling between their towns as a further punishment for the attack. \"Yesterday I ordered police and Israeli security services to launch a relentless attack against the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation and its commanders,\" Mr Sharon told reporters at Tel Aviv airport as he welcomed new immigrants arriving from North America. Israeli analysts took the prime minister's comments to mean that Israel would assassinate Islamic Jihad leaders if it could. The army said Islamic Jihad had been responsible for the deaths of 10 Israelis since their last suicide attack in February in Tel Aviv, which claimed five victims. In spite of the ceasefire that was agreed by Palestinian and Israeli leaders in February, the army has regularly operated in Palestinian areas, resulting in the deaths of around 40 Palestinians. However, it has suspended the policy of assassinating senior militants until now. The four victims of Tuesday's suicide attack by an 18-year-old Palestinian were yesterday named as Anna Lifshitz, 50, and Yulia Weltshin, 31, both from Netanya, and Rachel Ben Abu and Nofar Horvitz, both 16 and from Tel Aviv. The bomber, Sami Abu Khalil, was from the village of Atil, near Tulkarem, which is under full Israeli control. Meanwhile, Mr Sharon signalled his determination to continue with plans to evacuate settlements in Gaza and the West Bank by ordering the closure of the Gaza settlements to non-residents. The closure order was prompted by a march planned for Monday by opponents of the disengagement plan. The army feared that rightwing settlers would use the march as an opportunity to stay in the Gush Katif area of Gaza to frustrate the withdrawal, which is scheduled to begin in mid-August. Shortly after the announcement of the closure the Yesha Council, the settlers' pressure group, said in a statement: \"This is the first time in history that a Jewish prime minister blockades Jewish communities and declares a part of Israel Jews-free.\" It added: \"This is yet another achievement on the prime minister's part in tearing the nation apart and trampling over the values of democracy and Zionism as well as the residents' human rights.\" A separate rightwing group, National Home, announced that it would block roads all over Israel twice a week in protest. The group has already caused traffic jams during two previous demonstrations. Opponents of disengagement said the government should invest more time in hunting down Palestinian militants and less in evacuating the settlements. Israeli ministers focused part of the blame on the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, for not doing more to stop Islamic Jihad. Gideon Ezra, the Israeli security minister, told Israel radio: \"Abu Mazen [Mr Abbas] has to understand that these things don't just hurt Israel ... in the end it will bring down his government. \"His job now is to catch the people. He has the opportunity and the police, and to say 'I can't' is not an excuse. He has to try and he has to do it.\" Mr Abbas has attempted to persuade militant groups to abide by a ceasefire by negotiation, fearing a confrontation might lead to a civil war. In the last month the ceasefire has appeared increasingly fragile as Israeli army operations and Palestinian attacks increase. However, analysts believe that Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Israel share an interest in maintaining the imperfect calm until Israel has withdrawn from 26 settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza yesterday Palestinian gunmen released two aid workers, one British and one Dutch, 24 hours after they were snatched from their car. Palestinian police had been negotiating their release. The men were working on a water development project. The abduction of foreigners in Gaza is usually connected to local disputes rather than political issues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
