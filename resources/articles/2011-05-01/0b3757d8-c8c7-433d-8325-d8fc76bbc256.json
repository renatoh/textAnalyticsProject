Triumph is a state Bar\u00e7a's fans are very familiar with and it showed as 25,000 of them joyously cried \"ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9\" while their idols stroked the ball around the Wembley turf 700 miles away. The arch, an elegant redbrick structure near the city's main park, was built in 1888 to honour a historic Catalan victory that had never actually happened. It towered over a crowd consisting mainly of teenagers with faces painted in their team's colours, the occasional granny in a Bar\u00e7a scarf and strolling beer sellers refreshing the spectators that had gathered expectantly long before kick-off. Jordi, 65, was one of them. He had been in London in 1992, when Barcelona lifted their first European Cup. \"Wembley is holy ground to us. That's where it all started. We used to be a club that was always one step behind the greats. Now, we're the best team in the world.\" Bar\u00e7a were one match away from securing their fourth title, taking them level with Bayern Munich and Ajax. This was history in the making. A fact not lost on Jordi's nervously chain-smoking friend Andr\u00e9s, who declared himself a fanatical cul\u00e9, the name that Bar\u00e7a fans give themselves. \"If you pricked me my blood would be blaugrana, like the colours of the Bar\u00e7a shirt. I think they're better than they were than in Rome two years ago, where the whole team was playing for that chulo de mierda, Ronaldo.\" The subject of Madrid is never far from the surface, even after having vanquished their eternal rivals in the bad-tempered series of Cl\u00e1sicos. As the crowds swelled the atmosphere remained festive. Among the new chants around the plaza was \"Why, why, why \u2026?\" dedicated to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as an ironic riposte to his dark insinuation after his team's 0-2 defeat at the Bernab\u00e9u: \"Why does Bar\u00e7a always win?\" To Bar\u00e7a fans the answer is as clear as the slogan chosen by Bar\u00e7a's shirtmakers to celebrate victory in La Liga: Bar\u00e7a is \"a club with big values and big balls\". In the rest of Spain, the question of Bar\u00e7a's entitlement to being considered the best club in the world wasn't under discussion. Even the rabidly madridista daily sports paper Marca declared in their editorial that the time had come for Bar\u00e7a to \"crown a golden age\". Writing in the same paper, the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Zapatero \u2013 a lifelong Bar\u00e7a fan \u2013 gushed that the final would be \"a celebration of beauty between two teams with a lot of personality, two individual styles and two different ways of understanding the world\". On TVE, Spain's national television channel, the buildup to the final was under way, with the Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina as a \"surprise pundit\" declaring that the game was \"Bar\u00e7a's for the taking\". In Barcelona, the giant screen showing the final had been moved this year because the city's central Pla\u00e7a Catalunya had been occupied by disaffected youth taking part in Spain's other national sport: protesting. But as the game kicked off Bar\u00e7a fans insisted that victory celebrations would take place in the traditional spot at the top of Las Ramblas, despite recent tensions between the protesters and the local police. \"If we win it again, the whole city's going to go absolutely mental,\" said Susana, 25, her voice already strained by the emotion. As the game kicked off the crowd began to chant their mantra: \"Bar\u00e7a, Bar\u00e7a, Bar\u00e7a.\" After a tense opening, Pedro slotted home the first. \"Now we can relax a bit,\" said Jordi, his face redder than the can of local Estrella beer in his hand. But Rooney's equaliser was greeted with a collective howl of frustration. At half-time everyone agreed that Bar\u00e7a were unlucky not to be winning the game. Then Messi scored and Villa smashed home the third. Bar\u00e7a were now in control. At the final whistle the fans exploded with joy, a long night of partying lay ahead. Barcelona's Triumphal Arch had finally found the victory it had been waiting for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
