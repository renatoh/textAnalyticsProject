In a marriage of apparent opposites which is likely to remain unsurpassed in the history of opera and pop, the eight terrifying Valkyrie maidens will join a line-up which includes Sir Paul McCartney, Oasis and Muse. So will Br\u00fcnnhilde, Sieglinde, Wotan and a full orchestra of 91 musicians on a stage measured to the nearest millimetre to ensure there is space for them, if necessary, to keep dry. The potential 100,000-strong audience is thought to be the largest marshalled for an operatic performance. It will hear a five-minute introductory blast of The Ride of the Valkyries theme, familiar from the film Apocalypse Now, followed by a possibly less familiar 50 minutes of thrilling sung drama between the principal performers and the warrior maidens. The Ride is the title sometimes given to act three of Wagner's opera The Valkyrie. Last night the festival organisers had no qualms about their fans: \"A Glastonbury audience is prepared for anything. In the mid-1990s, we had Rolf Harris, and he went down very well.\" The performance, on June 27, will be the ultimate test of the belief that the warrior king Arthur slumbers beneath Glastonbury Tor, ready to awake in England's hour of need. Wagner transposed the Nordic myth of the Ring to the banks of the Rhine, from which sprang the west Germanic tribes of Anglo-Saxons who, in legend, smashed Arthur's resistance in the 5th century AD. If English myth has any truth, he may be unable to sleep through the shrieks of the Valkyries as they materialise yet again over his turf. For ENO, the performance incarnates any opera company's dream of reaching a wider, younger audience. \"In my view, it is not a gimmick,\" ENO's artistic director and chief executive, Sean Dorfan, said. \"I would not support anything for reasons of accessibility alone. \"His music appeals to the heart and the soul as much as to the intellect. For us, it is a way of changing people's views of where opera can happen. It could well be the largest single happening in live opera. It is pretty visionary of Glastonbury to invite us.\" The Guardian sponsors Glastonbury festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
