Green might like to jump in at the deep end with James Joyce's Ulysses. One of the most lauded, and least finished, novels of the 20th century, it concerns the Dublin wanderings of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom on June 16 1904. The date is now celebrated in the city every year as Bloomsday. 2. Nobel laureate (1969) Samuel Beckett offers sage advice \"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better\". Alternatively, Green could ponder on the identity of Godot. 3. If Green find streams of consciousness and grim realism too much heavy going, Oscar Wilde's witty aphorisms should provide some light relief. 4. Those seeking a puffed-up, boasting and shallow anti-hero to identify with need look no further than JM Synge's Playboy of the Western World. A wild, farcical play about reputation, celebrity and lost opportunity, it was pilloried in the press of the time as an affront to Irish culture. 5. Playwright and Nobel laureate (1925) George Bernard Shaw wrote more than 50 plays and a vegetarian cookbook, and was also fond of pointing out that \"fish\" could reasonably be spelt \"ghoti\" - gh as in trough, o as in women, ti as in station, although it remains a matter of controversy to some. 6. The Irish are no slouches when it comes to poetry either. The great WB Yeats, (Nobel laureate 1923) led the Irish literary renaissance aimed at reviving ancient Irish folklore, legends and traditions in new literary works. 7. Another Irish Nobel laureate (1995), Seamus Heaney, is proudly known as \"famous Seamus\" in his homeland. His works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth reflect a redemptive engagement with the Irish conflict. 8.Gulliver's Travels author Jonathan Swift acted as a diplomatic envoy between England and Ireland, but caused outrage when his polemic A Modest Proposal, in which he suggests that the Irish problem should be solved by getting the poor to sell their babies to the rich for food, was taken seriously by some. 9. Perhaps it slipped Green's mind that the blockbuster film The Commitments (as well as The Snapper and The Van) was adapted from the novels of Roddy Doyle. Doyle was awarded the Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, which pays homage to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. 10. Finally, if all this highbrow Irish literacy is too overwhelming, Green could always settle into a comfy armchair with a mug of cocoa and a nice fat saga by bestselling storyteller Maeve Binchy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
