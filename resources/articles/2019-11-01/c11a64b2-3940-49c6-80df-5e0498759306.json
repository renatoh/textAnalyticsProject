It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d Biden may indeed want Warren to be quiet \u2013 in Democratic primary polling he has fallen behind her in Iowa and New Hampshire, although he maintains a national lead. But he insisted his attack on the Massachusetts senator was not sexist. His initial remarks came in a Medium post entitled I Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career. \u201cThe other day,\u201d wrote Biden, \u201cI was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny. \u201c\u2026 But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2013 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2013 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker. \u201cSome call it the \u2018my-way-or-the-highway\u2019 approach to politics. But it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.\u201d Biden, the leading centrist in the primary field, did not mention Warren, the leading progressive, by name. But few had much difficulty working out the former vice-president\u2019s target and on Friday, speaking to CNN, Biden owned up. \u201cThe strong women in my life are angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it. It had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.\u201d Healthcare is a hot-button issue in the race to face Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Warren detailed a $20.5tn Medicare for All proposal, saying it would not require tax rises on middle class Americans. The plan was attacked by centrists including Biden and the mayor of South Bend, who has surged in Iowa and about whom the New York Times published a report on Saturday entitled: Why Pete Buttigieg Annoys His Democratic Rivals. Some wonder if Buttigieg, 37, might end up as the vice-presidential pick. On Saturday, though, Biden told a crowd in New Hampshire his running mate would be \u201cpreferably a woman\u201d who could \u201cmake up for some of my weaknesses\u201d. Warren\u2019s fundraising email did not mention Biden. But in terms familiar from the senator\u2019s fiery stump speech, it said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just women. When we speak up against Wall Street and big tech \u2026 we are told that everyone with less power should be quiet. \u201c\u2026Well, I am angry and I own it. I\u2019m angry on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump\u2019s government, our rigged economy, and business as usual.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
