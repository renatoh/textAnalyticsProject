Intriguingly, he's roped in his bandmate Alex Turner for an exclusive short story reading and added his own cover of mid-Nineties dance hit, 'Dreamer' by Livin' Joy. Quite why, frankly, is anybody's guess, but Helders' selection of stoner hip hop \u2013 notably Luniz' 'I've Got 5 on It' \u2013 never fails to bring about instant head-nod satisfaction. Better still, Turner's story, 'A Choice of Three', a plaintive tail of a love triangle aboard a train, is delivered with a vacant authority reminiscent of a young Malcolm McDowell. Indeed the singer's rhythmic flow is as vital unsung as it is with the Monkeys, proving that his poetic flair lives on long after the amps are turned off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
