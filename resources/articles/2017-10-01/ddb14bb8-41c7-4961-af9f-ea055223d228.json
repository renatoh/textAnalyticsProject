Archbishop Glenn Davies announced the donation on Monday in his address to the 51st synod of the diocese of Sydney, telling the church that \u201cremoving gender from the marriage construct\u201d would have \u201cirreparable consequences\u201d for society. \u201cBrothers and sisters, the stakes are high and the cost is high,\u201d Davies said. \u201cYet the cause is just and it is a consequence of our discipleship to uphold the gift of marriage as God has designed it \u2013 a creation ordinance for all people.\u201d He said he made \u201cno apology\u201d for encouraging Australians and Anglicans to vote no. \u201cI believe that a change in the definition of marriage is unwarranted, not just because it is in opposition to the teaching of scripture ... but because I believe marriage, traditionally understood as a union of one man and one woman, is a positive good for our society, where marriage and the procreation of children are bound together as the foundational fabric of our society, notwithstanding the sad reality that not all married couples are able to conceive,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, I consider the consequences of removing gender from the marriage construct will have irreparable consequences for our society, for our freedom of speech, our freedom of conscience and freedom of religion.\u201d The donation is the largest publicly declared by the no campaign. Neither the yes or no campaigns have publicly declared donations, but the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, personally donated $1m to the yes campaign last month. The no campaign has had two anonymous donors matching donations up to $200,000 and $400,000 respectively. Davies has been a vocal critic of the yes campaign, and accused it of \u201cbullying\u201d opponents. He made particular mention of the Coopers Brewing company, which he said had been the victim of an \u201cuncivilised, unwarranted and malicious campaign\u201d after it released a limited-edition light beer in association with the Bible Society. Davies\u2019 views are not universally held across the Anglican church. In August, the new Archbishop of Perth, Kay Goldsworthy, told the Guardian she favoured the more \u201cinclusive\u201d side of the marriage debate. In his speech Davies took aim at those sections of the Anglican religion which support same-sex marriage, criticising them for being \u201cmoulded into the patterns of their surrounding culture\u201d. \u201cThe Scottish Episcopal church has already decided to take this perilous path, and it is likely that Canada and the US will soon change their canons to follow suit,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
