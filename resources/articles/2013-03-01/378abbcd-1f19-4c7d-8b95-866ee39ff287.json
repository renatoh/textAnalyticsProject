The upmarket grocer is adding 400 more products to the 1,800-strong range \u2013 introduced as Britain lurched into recession in 2009 and food shoppers turned to discounters such as Aldi in record numbers. Waitrose has already expanded the label, which represents 18% of its total sales, to most key product categories including homeware. Waitrose and the so-called \"hard discounters\" have been winning market share off bigger rivals in recent years as shoppers have polarised. Analysts say the growth at the top and bottom of the market underlines the \"two nations\" of the UK. Waitrose has been working to ditch its posh image and has also pulled in more customers as increasing numbers of shoppers choose to use smaller supermarkets. Following the range's launch, in 2010 Waitrose introduced its Brand Price Match commitment to ensure that branded products were the same price as Tesco, excluding promotions. Waitrose's marketing director, Rupert Thomas, said: \"The success of the range has been overwhelming; 79% of shoppers now add an essential Waitrose product to their basket when shopping with us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
