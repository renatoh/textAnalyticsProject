I feel very let down, therefore, by her new tattoo, \"Mrs Cole\", branded on the back of her neck. However, if Ashley comes out within the week with \"Chezza's Fella\" etched somewhere highly visible, I think that would make it all right. Indecent proposal Svetlana Orlova was invited on a Spanish daytime television show where she was reunited with her ex-boyfriend, Ricardo Navarro, who promptly dropped to one knee, pulled out an engagement ring and begged her to come back to him. How sweet! The studio audience thought so and were perplexed when Orlova said no. What they didn't know is thatshe had a restraining order against him after allegatations that he had regularly beaten her up when they were together. Televised declarations of love: romantic?

Watching Cerys Matthews mope after her I'm a Celebrity love interest, ex-EastEnder Marc Bannerman, is enough to make me want to fly a Don't Do It banner above the camp. All right, so Cerys is unaware of the allegations made by his (now ex-) girlfriend, Sarah Matravers, that he has a violent temper, but she must remember that Marc has no qualms about humilating his partner of two years on national TV by indulging in heavy-duty flirtation - because he did it with Cerys. If that isn't setting off her Bad Man alarm, what will? But it just goes to show that on I'm A Celeb you can have a close encounter with something worse than cockroaches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
