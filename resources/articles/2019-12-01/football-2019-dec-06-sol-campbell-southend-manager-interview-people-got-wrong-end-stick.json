On taking charge at the League One club in October, he quickly identified the players\u2019 diet as one immediate area for improvement and banned ketchup and fizzy drinks from the canteen. At training, a plethora of fitness and conditioning tests sort the greyhounds from the gourmands. Campbell may still be relatively new to the coaching game but he means business. The data doesn\u2019t lie but then nor does the league table. It shows Southend in 22nd place, with one win and an alarming 53 goals conceded. This is the sort of form that did for Campbell\u2019s predecessor, Kevin Bond, and unless Campbell can turn things around in a hurry \u2013 ketchup or no ketchup \u2013 relegation awaits. There are plenty out there who would not mourn this in the slightest. Yet to spend some time in Campbell\u2019s company at Boots &amp; Laces, the former nightclub that serves as Southend\u2019s training base, you would scarcely know any of this. For all the team\u2019s travails, he is full of energy and full of laughter, eternally grateful for the chance to resume his nascent coaching career after a rollercoaster nine months at Macclesfield, where he miraculously saved them from relegation before leaving in a dispute over unpaid wages. (He is owed \u00a3182,000 and is backing a winding-up petition against the club.) And for a man who has graced the game\u2019s biggest stages, this is curiously the environment he loves best: mud and muck, grit and graft. He can still put himself about in training at the age of 45 and almost a decade after hanging up his boots still looks in superb nick. Of course, he is under no illusions. He knows the task is gargantuan. Campbell inherited a team being taken to the cleaners every week. The first game after his appointment \u2013 which he watched from the stands \u2013 was a chastening 7-1 thumping at home to Doncaster. Only on Tuesday night, in his fifth league game, did he claim his first point, a hard-fought 1-1 away draw against 10-man Burton. \u201cSometimes you get a team that has almost forgotten how to win,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s maybe fallen away from the standards that should be set at this level. Some are big problems, some of them are small problems. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight but the clock is ticking.\u201d Tough times demand bold choices. One is Campbell\u2019s insistence that Southend will continue to play from the back, despite coming unstuck against Oxford when a calamitous attempt to pass out of defence saw them concede after 52 seconds. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got big guys at the front,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have 40 to 50-yard punts up the field and expect them to stick. So we\u2019ve got to play through the lines. The main thing is when you make mistakes, you try to learn from them.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting analogue for Campbell\u2019s own journey and as the conversation turns from the coach to the man, it feels an appropriate time to delve a little deeper into one of English football\u2019s most enigmatic personalities. By turns outspoken and taciturn, headstrong and brittle, Campbell\u2019s entire career has been based on an unshakable self-belief in the face of prejudice, ridicule, even outright hatred. His decision to leave Tottenham for Arsenal in 2001 unleashed a torrent of contemptible abuse. His claim that racism has denied him opportunities within the game was greeted with spiteful derision. When he described himself as \u201cone of the greatest minds in football\u201d, lots of people laughed, none of whom actually knew him. And even to this day, Campbell seems to divide opinion wherever he goes. Spurs fans still revel in his every setback, naturally, but even journalistic colleagues warned he could be spiky company. \u201cA bit odd,\u201d was a frequent comment. It feels anticlimactic to report that Campbell is disappointingly normal in the flesh. He is assured, certainly but no more so than most professional athletes. Occasionally testy without ever straying into awkwardness. Perhaps a little more guarded with his words than he used to be, given the way he has been burned in the past. But above all curious, thoughtful and generous with his time. \u201cI feel a lot of people have listened to too many other people,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a massive PR machine. I\u2019m just a normal guy. I work hard. I like players who hate losing. That\u2019s who I am. The trouble is, as time went on, people got the wrong end of the stick about me: whether it\u2019s lazy journalism, or someone with an axe to grind \u2026\u201d Where did that unshakable confidence come from? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe from the streets? I\u2019m a street footballer. I\u2019m hardcore. Growing up in east London, you\u2019ve got to be a little bit self-confident. As a player, I would go into detail, watch who I was playing against. Who might come into my vicinity. That gives you self-confidence.\u201d Does he reckon that blithe self-confidence was ever mistaken for arrogance? \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks after a long pause. I tell him I think so. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he replies, \u201cI\u2019m respectful, I\u2019m understanding, I\u2019m open-minded. And if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, who else is going to believe in you? That\u2019s the starting block. If that\u2019s got misconstrued or misunderstood, then I apologise. That\u2019s how I am. I\u2019m not disrespecting anyone. Yes, I have faults. No one\u2019s perfect.\u201d The thing is, without that confidence, Campbell might never have made it to the first rung of the coaching ladder. Whereas contemporaries such as Gareth Southgate and Steven Gerrard walked straight into high-level coaching roles after retirement, it took Campbell seven years to land his first job at League Two Macclesfield. \u201cWaiting on the sidelines,\u201d as he puts it. \u201cSometimes you do say: \u2018Well, when do you reckon it\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 But I totally believed and sometimes you\u2019ve got to take a job where you\u2019ve really got to work at it.\u201d Why was he so set on coaching, a precarious job with a dangerously short life expectancy? Clearly it wasn\u2019t for the money. He returns the question. \u201cDoes Frank Lampard need to work? Does Jonathan Woodgate need to work? People need a goal and my goal is to be one of the most successful managers going forward. I love the game. I love the strategy. I love the day-to-day religion of football. So why would I go somewhere else?\u201d Does it give him any scintilla of satisfaction, any extra ounce of motivation, to know there are so many people praying for him to trip up? \u201cBut that happens in life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d Respectfully, I tell him, I beg to differ. Were I to lose my job, I\u2019d probably get a few dozen people gloating on Twitter but that would be the end of it. Were he to get sacked, or relegated, there are thousands of people who would take a weird, macabre pleasure in it. Probably the same people who sing songs about him dying, or pursue him with homophobic taunts. The irrational animosity out there for Sol Campbell is not \u2013 whatever else you could call it \u2013 normal. A long, long pause. \u201cBut when I look at myself,\u201d he replies eventually, \u201cI say: \u2018Sol, when have you ever had it easy in your life anyway?\u2019 Nothing\u2019s come easy to me. Nothing. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s something that\u2019s new to me. No one\u2019s life runs perfect. You\u2019re going to get hired. You\u2019re going to get sacked. In the end, not everyone\u2019s going to like you. Concentrate on the people who are there for you. Surround yourself with people who are positive.\u201d They certainly speak highly of him at Southend, where the mood and performances have improved, even if results haven\u2019t quite yet. The January transfer window offers his first chance to refresh the squad and the experience of Macclesfield last season offers a template for the great escape. \u201cI was given no hope,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cAnd I got out of that. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a no-hope scenario now but it\u2019s similar. It\u2019s even tougher.\u201d Once the tape is off, we talk some more. We talk about how much east London has changed from when he grew up, about Southend (he has heard the pier is the longest in the world, and would like to walk it soon), about his vision for the club. Above all, you get the feeling that after everything he has endured, he is just happy to be back, even if it\u2019s at a League One club 10 points adrift of safety. \u201cPlease God, I\u2019ve got a job now,\u201d he beams. \u201cAnd I love it. I love everything about it.\u201d And you wonder whether the English footballing public is finally ready to make its peace with Sol Campbell. Because he certainly seems to have made his peace with them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
