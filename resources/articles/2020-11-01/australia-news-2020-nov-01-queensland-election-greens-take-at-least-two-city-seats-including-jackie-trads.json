Across four electorates spanning the Brisbane CBD and surrounding northern and western suburbs, the Greens polled more than a third of primary votes. South Brisbane \u2013 where community worker Amy MacMahon defeated former deputy premier and treasurer Trad \u2013 was the only seat Labor lost on an otherwise successful election night. However the Green wave \u2013 which came very close to capturing more Labor-held seats \u2013 will cause concern within Labor that the party\u2019s efforts to pitch itself to coal country voters may have prompted a backlash among young and climate-conscious people in the city. The state election featured animosity between Labor and Greens supporters, in large part due to the campaign to unseat Trad. As one of Labor\u2019s most progressive MPs and the champion of abortion decriminalisation and other reforms, Trad had been relentlessly targeted by News Corp publications and the Liberal National party. The Greens also held the seat of Maiwar, where Michael Berkman will serve a second term. It had been marginal but Berkman now holds the seat, which is centred on Indooroopilly and Toowong, by about 7%. The leftwing party led in the northern suburbs seat of Cooper \u2013 once held by the LNP\u2019s Campbell Newman, and where popular Labor minister Kate Jones is retiring \u2013 for much of the count on Saturday night but pre-poll and postal vote counts appear to have delivered it back to Labor. Last night Berkman said the party had pitched a \u201cradical redistributive platform\u201d to voters, including a massive hike to mining royalties to pay for social services. \u201cPeople are responding to that,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cFor us, this election has really been about ordinary Queenslanders versus mining billionaires and vested interests. \u201cThe Queenslanders we\u2019ve spoken to, they\u2019re making these voices heard with these results. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely chuffed to see the rest of these results come in. We\u2019ve been speaking to people on the doors all over the city here and we know they like the platform we\u2019ve brought.\u201d Labor sources said the rising Greens vote is \u201ca clear challenge\u201d for the party, but its broader election success, particularly in regional Queensland, meant it was unlikely Labor would pivot to counter. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to beat up on mining companies when you don\u2019t have to campaign in Mackay,\u201d one Labor MP told the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
