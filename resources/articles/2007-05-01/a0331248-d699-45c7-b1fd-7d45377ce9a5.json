The West Indies cricket team comes to a halt much sooner than that. A day claimed to be the coldest in English Test history predictably induced their heaviest defeat. It has always been like this, and probably always will. There has been endless speculation about why Caribbean youngsters have turned to basketball instead of fast bowling, but it may be because in basketball you can leave the central heating on. The only way that West Indies would have taken this match into a final day was if Asad Rauf's index finger had dropped off through frostbite. It was so cold in Headingley yesterday that dogs were frozen to lampposts, student landlords had their hands in their own pockets and thoroughly sensible spectators wanted to be dressed as a Womble or a zipped-up thermal banana. For West Indies, it was so cold that their tour of hell seemed about to freeze over. As they say in Yorkshire, it was a bit \"parky\" but it is questionable whether yesterday really was the coldest Test day. The BBC held it to be 7.4C at start of play, lower than the 8C that was recorded when England played New Zealand at Edgbaston in 1965, but that information came from Leeds Bradford Airport, where virtually the only time you don't land in freezing fog is when you have been diverted. Car temperature gauges showed 9C on the way to the ground and by the time the West Indies surrender was complete it had probably crept up a little further. To the West Indians it all held about as much appeal as Estonian ice cricket, which recently held its first world championship on Harku Lake in Tallinn. Chelsea Arts Club won it, despite half the fielders stopping to paint the scene. They would have given West Indies a good game yesterday. From here it may not get any better for West Indies. After the traditional Test opener at Lord's they have been given a northern tour, with Leeds, Manchester and Chester-le-Street in quick succession. They will try to regroup in Durham against the MCC, which is Sanath Jayasuriya plus a group of university students, including Mali Richards, son of Viv. How the England and Wales Cricket Board tempted them into this itinerary is a mystery. Presumably the ECB made great play of global warming; it will be no surprise if the team's programme for their free days this week includes a tour of Todmorden olive groves and a visit to an Ashington winery. Instead they looked at the outfield yesterday and saw the awful truth: Paul Collingwood wearing hand-warmers on his ears. Spectators these days, though, have it easy. This Test lasted barely 200 overs and for much of that time, thanks to Kevin Pietersen, England scored at more than 4\u00bd runs an over. Against New Zealand 42 years ago the chill must have cut deeper. It took England the best part of two days to get 435, with Ken Barrington spending 7\u00bc hours making 137. Barrington used to talk about \"booking in for bed and breakfast\", so naturally much of that was spent sleeping. They say that seaside landladies never really recovered their trade after that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
