Of course that is usually a lot of nonsense. It must tell you something if I say that this particular chief constable has been a Guardian reader since university (remember Varoomshka?), is a keen sportsman still playing the occasional game of cricket and coaching youngsters in the game, has put three children through the education system and is well attached to the real world. Like most recruits, I joined the police full of zeal to make a difference to the world I was living in. I can honestly say I have enjoyed every single minute of it. But how policing has changed in the last 30 years. I never expected it to be an easy role - easy wasn't what I was after. As a young man I wanted challenges, variety and excitement, I wanted to meet people and I really did want to serve the community. I wanted a career I could be proud of, one that could give me job satisfaction as well as a decent living for my family. But looking back I am quite astonished by the pace and the breadth of change the police service has gone through. Who'd have thought even 10 years ago that we would be able to identify people by their DNA or that computers could match fingerprints in seconds when it had taken weeks by humans. As fast as we've advanced, people's expectations of the police have moved on even faster. In truth, we are now the only all-purpose 24 hour emergency service. We get calls to every type of incident where someone feels they need help. In my force alone that amounts to over 1m telephone calls and nearly 200,000 incidents a year - and Northamptonshire is one of the smaller forces. Multiply that figure across the country and you can see that the scale of demand is astronomical. And it's going up all the time; you wouldn't believe the impact the mobile phone has had on police resources. For example, our headquarters' control room, which covers our motorways, was swamped with more than 80,000 mobile phone calls to 999 last year - dozens of calls, every time there's an accident or incident, coming in from well meaning people. As we struggle to respond to those ever increasing demands, my colleagues and I try to understand the gap between the reality of policing in the 21st century and what the public expects us to deliver. Let me tell you, public expectations of our police are far too high! Our workload includes everything from terrorism, murder and paedophiles through organised crime to street violence, burglary, and so on. We deal with missing people, abused children, people with mental welfare problems, most road traffic law, street violence, licensing, not to mention stray dogs and the escorting of abnormal loads. Oh - don't forget the odd natural disaster (floods, foot and mouth), major disaster (rail crash) or industrial dispute. Police officers reading this article will be thinking I should have mentioned a hundred other things in this list. It still is one of the best jobs in the world, but there are just not enough of us to do all these tasks with the same degree of focus and success. Most western countries have three times as many police officers. Our system has worked perfectly well until recently, when the workload has begun to crush those trying to cope with it. Everyone has a view of the police, which may be based on personal experience but is more likely to be nurtured by outside influences. In recent times (not just recent governments), the media and politicians have begun to feed a public debate, featuring a continuing saga of inefficiency and failure. Of course we are not perfect and should always be open to public scrutiny (at present, as chief constable of Northamptonshire, I am inspected or audited by at least eight outside organisations). Like all public services we are easy targets; operational and other decisions taken under pressure are much easier when analysed with hindsight at home. As a young officer on nights, I was told by my sergeant to beware the \"9 o'clock shudders\". This, he explained, was a condition affecting senior officers who came to their desk at 9am and criticised the frontline decisions taken the previous night. \"They should've done this\" or \"they should've done that\". Now it seems society has the 9 o'clock shudders. The spiral is inexorably downwards, which is intensely depressing. Will no one actually tell us what is our most important job? Is it graffiti, nuisance, burglary - or is it the inter-galactic cyber criminal?. The general cynicism about policing damages our staff. That word morale. Young men and women (and some not so young) are rushing about dealing with a host of traumatic incidents, the like of which most people couldn't face. They do this usually with a good spirit, a smile and often with great success. I know from the many letters I get that people in the community are grateful for their help. These officers are achieving what we all set out to do - they are making a difference to people's lives. We deal with millions of incidents a year. Pro rata, mistakes are few, but inevitably they hit the headlines and create the impression that the whole police service is inefficient or corrupt, or both. Those same young people are squashed by bureaucracy created to satisfy a court system or an audit process. and bombarded with criticisms about attitude, racism and unprofessionalism. Independent research has shown that a citizen has less chance of being a victim of crime now than any time since 1981. Yet we are described as failing, inefficient. That may be true of the criminal justice system, but the police have massively increased their workload per officer and even with the crime rises of the last six months we are still safer than 1991. Yet nobody believes that. No wonder my staff are beginning to feel they can please no one. This spiral of unmet expectation damages the country. It reduces public confidence and has a knock-on effect on communities. Your police are independent and they must continue to be so, so they can protect the individual from the power of the state. But this can only work when there is mutual confidence between the police and the public. I believe that confidence is being eroded because we do not have enough people to deal with our range of responsibilities. A police force that is pilloried routinely for failing in areas where others have responsibility (court decisions and drug abuse are good examples of this) will lose the confidence of the public - then we will fail. We were formed to make the streets safe, not to deal with faulty rear lights. We would like to concentrate on crime, reducing it and detecting it, producing streets and communities where people can live safely. But every day a new priority comes over the hill sponsored by media or politicians or local community; one that wasn't there yesterday (who was excited about asylum seekers or cyber crime five years ago?). If it is not possible to tell the police service what is really important, and then to accept with a certain stoicism that some other tasks might not be done quite as well, the face of policing will change. I am afraid that we will resort to ticking boxes, allocating numbers, operating helpdesks and getting by with very impersonal contact. Do you know, I can hear you saying, \"But that's all you do anyway.\" Oh no we don't. We deal with millions of incidents every day, and in Northamptonshire our people get this 24-hour service for 37p each a day - the price of a small bar of chocolate. - Chris Fox was born in East Yorkshire and oined Nottinghamshire Police in 1972 after taking a degree in electrical engineering and physics at Loughborough University.
