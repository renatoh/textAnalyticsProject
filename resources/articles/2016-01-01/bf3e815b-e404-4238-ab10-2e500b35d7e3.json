He didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before; he was up reading Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s A Little Life, speeding towards the book\u2019s devastating conclusion. Ever since Christmas \u2013 when the novel\u2019s prevalence on year-end lists guaranteed its spot among my friends as a gloomy, dauntingly large stocking filler \u2013 the messages have been rolling in. My friend Tom texted, \u201cHorrendous but there are 150+ pages of bad stuff,\u201d and then, a week later, \u201cI am still thinking about the book.\u201d On Facebook, one friend told me, \u201cIT IS SLAYING ME,\u201d and another suggested a support group. They\u2019re not alone. According to Jon Michaud in the New Yorker: \u201cYanagihara\u2019s novel can also drive you mad, consume you and take over your life.\u201d He\u2019s right: the big book of our Australian summer is as bleak and addictive as they come. Set in the present, A Little Life is about four young men \u2013 friends from the same college \u2013 who move to New York to chase big careers. They are all, improbably, incredibly successful: JB in the art world, Malcolm as a \u201cstarchitect\u201d, Willem as an actor and Jude as a litigator. The story narrows its focus on Jude: broken, full of secrets, self-harming, slicing his calves and arms at 2am, his body a web of scar tissue. Yes, it\u2019s a lovely beach read. Reading, of course, is a solo activity. But occasionally a book forces demands on you that are so immense you need consolation from others. You urge your book club to read it (or you form a book club to that end); you post status updates, you tweet; you give it to other people to read, burdening them so that you\u2019re not left alone with this thing. It\u2019s not just me and my pals. According to the Wall Street Journal, in \u201crecent months it [the book] has gathered momentum, fuelled by booksellers and readers, particularly on Twitter, where people have shared their intensely emotional responses \u2026 [On Twitter] they have called it \u2018upsetting\u2019, \u2018harrowing\u2019 and \u2018traumatic\u2019. But many also say it\u2019s the best book they have ever read.\u201d So why has it struck such a chord? Despite being on the Booker shortlist, the US novelist\u2019s prose is a little patchy and the plot is at times almost operatic in its hysteria. How much suffering and abuse can one character believably endure? Yanagihara told the Guardian: \u201cOne of the things my editor and I did fight about is the idea of how much a reader can take,\u201d and you\u2019ll find it hard to find another mainstream literary fiction that equals the most egregious \u201cmisery memoir\u201d for its plotlines. As the New Yorker pointed out, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s Lolita and Emma Donoghue\u2019s Room let the worst abuses appear off stage. Not so here. Sometimes books come along that match the times. A Little Life is the perfect chronicle of our age of anxiety, providing all its attendant dramas (cutting, binges and childhood sexual abuse) as well as its solaces: friendship, drugs, travel, love affairs and interior design. In the New York Review of Books, Daniel Mendelsohn noted the novel \u201creveals itself as a very twenty-first century tale indeed: abuse, victimisation, self-loathing\u201d and wondered if a \u201cgeneralised sense of helplessness and acute anxiety have become the norm\u201d. The piece referred to an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education about a new prevalence of cases in which seemingly trivial things (a mouse in the dorm room, for instance) caused great upset to the young people involved, leading them to seek counselling. \u201cYoung people are increasingly encouraged to see themselves not as agents in life but as potential victims: of their dates, their roommates, their professors, of institutions and history in general,\u201d Mendelsohn wrote. In this culture, he said, the victim has the status: \u201cTo such readers [of A Little Life], the ugliness of this author\u2019s subject must bring a kind of pleasure, confirming their pre-existing view of the world as a site of victimisation and little else.\u201d Generalised anxiety and dread is in the atmosphere, after all. In the new godless world, there are no fixed external points or a commonly held set of beliefs; all that was solid has long ago melted into air. Generation Y, raised with the promise of an extraordinary life \u2013 a spectacular career, freewheeling adventures, money, love, the lot \u2013 has found that promise undelivered. Suddenly there\u2019s a lot to be afraid of; success is difficult to achieve and hard to hang on to, you can\u2019t defeat your past and, in the words of musician Father John Misty, \u201cNo one ever really knows you and life is brief.\u201d Our daily social interactions have blown out from a few dozen to potential thousands, which we carry around with us every moment on our smartphones. Restless capital means a working life that more closely resembles greyhounds chasing the rabbit than any kind of craftsmanship. There\u2019s no rest, no respite, no commonly held beliefs to bind us together, and there\u2019s a gap between dreams and reality; the big life you wanted is the little life you made. But if anxiety is our age\u2019s burden, then friendship is its balm. Friendship is the solace in A Little Life, as it is in any life riven with anxiety, and it is rendered so exquisitely lifelike here \u2013 replete with beauty and dark currents \u2013 that it almost approximates the real thing. The characters\u2019 friendships represent the type of love known as agape, described by CS Lewis in The Four Loves as the highest level of love known to humanity: \u201cA selfless love, a love that was passionately committed to the wellbeing of the other.\u201d Mark Twain put friendship at the centre of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and David Malouf did it with Johnno, but most novelists\u2019 stick to Big Love \u2013 the love that includes sex, romance, marriage and ever after. Yet it\u2019s friendship that saves us time and time again, from the schoolyard to the office and beyond \u2013 so why aren\u2019t there more novels and films about it? Why is the sexual relationship always at the centre? Of course there is sex in A Little Life, but it is sex between friends \u2013 and then it becomes something else entirely. Willem thinks at one point of his relationship with Jude: \u201cThey were inventing their own type of relationship, one that wasn\u2019t officially recognised by history or immortalised in poetry or song, but which felt truer and less constraining.\u201d A standout novel of 2014, Ben Lerner\u2019s 10:04, also featured a friendship at its centre (this one between a man and a woman) and an anxious protagonist in an anxious city, wedged between hurricanes Sandy and Irene. According to Emily Witt in the Guardian: \u201cThe close platonic friendship between Alex and Ben has no precedent that I can think of in recent fiction, despite the prevalence of such relationships in the world around me.\u201d Similarly, it\u2019s the varied complexities of friendship \u2013 light, dark; support, competition; admiration, jealousy; love, obsession \u2013 which forms the heart of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels series, the runaway success of the past few years. Most books are still caught up in a world where romance and sex takes precedence, but we\u2019re now in a cultural moment in which relationships \u2013 romantic, sexual, platonic, polygamous, online, all this together and more \u2013 are accepted as much more fluid and complex than they used to be. As Willem would put it, we are inventing new types of relationships. A Little Life succeeds and connects because it is willing to explore those nuances. We mightn\u2019t be able to recognise ourselves in the darker material \u2013 the cutting, the urge for annihilation \u2013 but something rings true and real about the love between friends in an anxious world. So if you see us sitting on beaches with a big book, weeping, you\u2019ll know why. \u2022 A Little Life is out now through Pan Macmillan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
