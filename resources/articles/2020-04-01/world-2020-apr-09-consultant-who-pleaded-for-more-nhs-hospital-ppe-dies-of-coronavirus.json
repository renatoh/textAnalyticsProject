Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney east London, died after spending 15 days in Queens hospital, Romford. Last month he wrote a Facebook message to Boris Johnson outlining the urgent need for PPE for frontline staff and calling for testing for healthcare workers to be fast-tracked. He wrote: \u201cDear and respectable prime minister Mr Boris Johnson, Please ensure urgently PPE for each and every NHS health worker.\u201d He told Johnson that healthcare workers \u201care in direct contact with patients\u201d and have a \u201chuman right like others to live in this world disease-free with our family and children\u201d. Philip Glanville, the Labour mayor of Hackney, hailed Chowdhury as a \u201chero\u201d who died serving the borough.
