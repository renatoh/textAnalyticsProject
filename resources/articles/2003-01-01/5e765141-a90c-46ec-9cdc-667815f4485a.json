Here are 10 that caught our eye, admittedly not always for their technological innovation or sparkling performance. Handy video jukebox Several companies paraded personal audio/video jukeboxes that enable users to watch recorded TV programmes on the move. Best of the bunch was the Thomson Lyra RD2780, which pairs a 20Gigabyte hard disk (capable of storing 80 hours of video) with a 3.5inch TFT LCD screen. The RD2780 can also store JPeg images and play back MP3 music. No clues as to a price or UK launch date. www.thomson.net Keyless PC keyboard It might look like an off the wall gaming keypad but the KeyBowl Orbitouch is actually the first PC keyboard without keys or a mouse. To create letters, users twist the pair of oddly sculpted domes into different positions. At \u00a3400, it is not going to replace the Qwerty just yet, but it could prove a lifesaver to those, who through injury or RSI, can't use a full keyboard. www.keybowl.com Camera key ring These days, no self-respecting IT professional will be seen without a USB storage gadget dangling from their keyring. While we have seen MP3 players integrated in these devices, Philips is taking the USB gizmo to a new level by adding a digital camera. Coming in early summer are four models capable of shooting either 1.3 or 2.0 megapixel images. Prices are yet to be confirmed, but if the US is anything to go by, expect to pay between \u00a3100-200 depending on the model. www.philips.com Phone for the home Olympia has become the first company to debut a cordless home phone that also features a Bluetooth transmitter - the CDP 24201. Owners can wander round their homes, chatting away on their Bluetooth wireless headsets, or, if they have a dial-up internet connection, talk and surf at the same time. Due in the UK very soon, probably with a \u00a3200 price tag. www.olympiaphones.com Recharger for five Who says that we Brits don't come up with genius inventions? The Splash Pad is a tray-like device that can simultaneously recharge as many as five portable devices (mobile phones/PDAs). Just think - no more wondering where you left your recharging lead. Its inventors hope it will be installed in public places, too, so you'll be able to top up your battery's power while slurping on a cappuccino. The only downside is that an adaptor has to be fitted to the phone/PDA before it will work with the Splash Pad. www.splashpower.com Sophisticated remote Billed as the dashboard for the digital home, the Philips i-Pronto is one of the most sophisticated remote control systems to date. The touch screen device allows users to wirelessly manage home entertainment devices, lighting, and security cameras on its 6.4inch LCD screen via a Wi-Fi internet connection. Owners can also access websites or use the i-Pronto for listening to MP3s or looking at digital images. Sadly, it isn't due in the UK until the end of the year, when it will probably retail for around \u00a31,500. www.philips.com Network it on the cheap Network cameras, essentially webcams that can be viewed and controlled via the internet, are nothing new. US company Veo, however, caused a major splash at ICES with its Observer model, which retails for $200 - significantly cheaper than most of its rivals. The Observer captures video, audio and still images and can be configured to automatically send an email alert with a snapshot if movement is detected. Details of the US electronics dealers that sell the Observer are available on its website. www.veo.com Perceptive recorder ICES was awash with hard disk recorders for storing both audio and video. Few are as competitively priced as the Perception Digital music recorder, which has just been launched in the UK for \u00a3300. It features a 20GB hard drive (you can increase this to 40GB for an extra \u00a350) which stores music from its integrated CD player in either CD (PCM) or MP3 quality. www.richersounds.com Pop Idol in a box Quite possibly the saddest product on sale in the world this year is the $150 Singing Machine/ MTV SMVG-600 karaoke system. Sure, with its integrated monitor, CD players and speakers, it is a great partner for your karaoke video CDs. It is just we aren't entirely sure about the pop-up camera that allows would-be Will Youngs to make video recordings of their performance. www.singingmachine.com Ray of light for Game Boy Game Boy Advance owners who seem to run out of battery juice at crucial gaming moments can now enlist some help from the sun. Gemini Industries showed its Solar Pak recharger, below, for the Game Boy, which converts rays into extra battery power. No UK launch plans yet, but the Americans get it in March for $29.99. www.gemini-usa.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
