From his vantage point in the BBC Five Live radio commentary box overlooking the final corner at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Davidson heard the flat burble of Button's traction control cutting in unexpectedly as his car skipped over the inside kerb, which immediately threw him out too wide to make the exit of the turn. Davidson had the words out of his mouth in warning almost before the BAR slammed off the track, leaving Button with his world championship points score still firmly stuck on zero and his personal ambitions again thwarted as he heads for Indianapolis for next weekend's US grand prix. \"It was completely my mistake,\" said Button, \"and very frustrating because we were looking good. \"My start wasn't great and the Renaults got better traction off the line at the start, which allowed them to leapfrog me. \"We have to look at the positives from the weekend. We have made real progress.\" Closer analysis of the race shows Button's assessment to be optimistic. He was running third only after the retirement of the Renault pair, Giancarlo Fisichella with hydraulic failure and the world championship leader Fernando Alonso because, like Button, he hit the wall after a rare mistake. BAR-Honda attempted to put the best possible gloss on Button's performance before his exit with 23 of the 70 laps remaining, but the fact remains that their car simply does not yet have the speed to get on terms with Renault or McLaren-Mercedes.\"We are obviously disappointed not to finish the race,\" said Gil de Ferran, BAR-Honda's sporting director. \"However, the overwhelming feeling as we leave Canada and head to the US is a very positive one.\" Yet this shortage of hard results is generating another dilemma for Button and BAR, namely the contractual obligation for Button to switch to the Williams team in 2006 unless he has amassed 75% of the championship leader's points tally by the end of July. This is now almost impossible, and the downside to this equation for Button is that Williams look in disarray, locked in a war of words with their engine supplier BMW and looking no more competitive than BAR. Over the Canadian grand prix weekend Frank Williams moved rather clumsily to dissociate himself from criticisms of BMW made by his engineering chief Patrick Head, who accused the German car maker of a \"dishonest approach\". \"The remarks made by Patrick were a private remark and absolutely do not reflect the position of this company in respect to Mario [Theissen, head of motor sport at BMW] or to BMW,\" said Williams. \"One particular remark was taken slightly out of context. \"I have frequently said BMW are tough, hard people and that is why they are a rich and very profitable company. That is how you get the job done.\" However, sources close to BMW say the damage to the relationship with Williams is terminal and it is just a question of when, and not if, the deal is axed. Where this leaves Button's career path is unclear, but the signs are not promising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
