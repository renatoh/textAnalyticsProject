It has a little of John Woo and Ridley Scott, and Myung-se Lee's direction provides for plenty of expertly shot thrills and a good performance from Joong-Hoon Park as the pudgy, facetious, and dangerously amoral Detective Woo. There are some pleasingly weird and cynical touches illuminating crime lore, such as the \"lucky money\" that one detective on stake-out holds up for another's inspection: \"You take it off an accident victim, iron it, and you're safe till retirement.\" Atmospheric, certainly, but in the end this procedural is by the book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
