A PFA ballot on the issue last Friday saw 99% of the union's members vote in favour of industrial action if their demand for a 5% share of television monies - worth \u00a327.5m - is not accepted by the Premier League, Football Association and Football League when talks resume in Manchester today. Their current share of the pot amounts to around \u00a310m. Parul Patel, a sports lawyer with Hammond Suddards Edge specialising in employment law, warned yesterday that the Premier League would be on \"a reasonably strong footing\" if they were to challenge the legality of a strike. \"In my personal opinion, strike action is likely to be illegal,\" she said. \"The Football League and Premier League regulate their competitions but, while all the clubs are members, it is not right to say that the governing bodies are the players' employers. The clubs are. \"The legality of industrial action also hinges on whether this constitutes a trade dispute. The issue of television money is not strictly speaking a trade dispute and doesn't affect the terms and conditions under which the players are employed. \"Whilst it does concern players - in respect of their education and future once they quit the game - it is not a 'trade dispute', so the Football League and Premier League might consider taking out an injunction on the basis that this is not a lawful strike.\" Furthermore, players could run the risk of being sued by their clubs if they went ahead with industrial action. \"The only immunity granted to employees going on strike - provided they have gone through all the normal procedures and it is a trade dispute - is from dismissal,\" Patel added. \"It does not grant immunity from being sued for breach of contract, ie non-performance. So the clubs could sue the players for their losses - the cost of paying players who did not go on strike but cannot now do their jobs, or the loss of television money if cameras are turned off at games that actually still take place.\" Compromise appeared a long way off yesterday following the cancellation of a meeting between Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, and the Premier League chairman David Richards. Richards had contacted his chief executive Richard Scudamore on Friday to prepare for yesterday's talks, but Taylor insisted he felt \"insulted\" that the PFA had not been officially told the meeting was off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
