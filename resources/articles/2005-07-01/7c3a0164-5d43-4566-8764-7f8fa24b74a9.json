Shares in the group, whose products include Mothers Pride bread, rose more than 6% from their opening price of 275p to close at 292.5p. The opening price was near the top of the stock's 228p-285p indicated price range and the issue was six times oversubscribed. In the first day of trading, more than 100m shares changed hands. The company is viewed as a low-risk defensive stock, with the shares yielding some 5.4%. The IPO was London's second largest float of the past two years, after poker group Partygaming, which joined the exchange last month. Formerly known as Ranks Hovis McDougall, RHM owns a portfolio of brands including Mr Kipling, Hovis, Paxo, Robertson's, Sharwoods and Bisto. It claims 98% of UK households have at least one of its products in the kitchen cupboard. It also makes own-label products for Asda, Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose. The chief executive, Ian McMahon, said he was \"delighted\" by the response to the float. \"We have a strategy to continue RHM's transformation into the leading UK-focused food company and we are determined to create value for our shareholders by executing this strategy successfully.\" The \u00a31.02bn valuation at the end of the first day's trading is exactly in line with analysts' expectations. The group had sales of \u00a31.53bn in the year to the end of April. RHM, which was established 130 years ago as a flour miller, was acquired by Doughty Hanson five years ago. The private equity group will keep a substantial stake. Some \u00a3475m was raised from the float, of which \u00a3125m will go to the RHM pension fund to cut its deficit by half; the proceeds will also be used to cut RHM's debt to \u00a3711m. Doughty Hanson and RHM management and employees sold shares worth \u00a3136m. Charlie Bonham, an analyst at Oriel Securities, described RHM as \"probably the best quality high yielder in the sector\" and set a target for the shares of 330p for the next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
