On the other side of the path some of the richest people on the planet have gathered to drink the JCB digger billionaire Lady Carole Bamford\u2019s Chateau Leoube Provencal ros\u00e9, snack on individually wrapped smoked salmon tartare and duck egg sandwiches, and open their wallets to bid on thoroughbred racehorses in one of the world\u2019s most unusual auctions. Prospective buyers at the Goffs London Sale on Perks Field \u2013 part of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s private Kensington Palace garden \u2013 were reminded to bring their colours (the brightly coloured jackets jockeys wear when they race) as 14 of the 23 horses up for auction were already entered to race at Royal Ascot. \u201cWe have said to people do bring your colours because if you buy [a horse] tonight and have no colours it could be running tomorrow, and you need your racing colours,\u201d Eimear Mulhern, Goff\u2019s chairman, said as she welcomed guests to the venue on Monday night. \u201cIf you see someone walking around with their colours you get some indication they are ready to buy.\u201d At last year\u2019s sale Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Thai billionaire and owner of Leicester City FC who died in a helicopter crash in October, spent \u00a32m. \u201cHe came to the sale and he bought a horse for every day of Ascot,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens at this sale.\u201d More than \u00a325m has been spent on horses at the sale over the past five years. Mulhern said the rich clientele, who have flown in from Australia, the US, Japan and China, love horses but they are also buying access to \u201cthe hottest ticket in town: being in the parade ring with Her Majesty\u201d. \u201cWe had a Japanese man the very first year and his plane was late. We had one horse left in the sale with entry to Ascot and he just bought it,\u201d Mulhern recalled. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much it was, though it was \u00a3160,000, but two days later he\u2019s at Royal Ascot standing in the parade ring with Her Majesty, and that just meant so much to him.\u201d The horse didn\u2019t win at Ascot but, Mulhern said, it went on to win five big races. The most expensive horse sold on Monday was Mohican Heights, the two-year-old son of the 2014 Epsom Derby winner Australia, which was was bought for \u00a3520,000 by David Simcock, a Newmarket-based racehorse trainer. Simcock declined to identify the buyer, but said: \u201cThe clients, who are already in the yard, are always on the lookout for a nice horse and he\u2019s certainly going to get middle distances so he fitted in well.\u201d Mohican Heights is entered in Saturday\u2019s Chesham Stakes (at the time of writing, he was around 12-1). Just 10 of the 22 lots were sold, for a total of \u00a33.15m, as many of the horses failed to meet reserve prices. Henry Beeby, Goff\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cObviously we would have preferred to sell a few more of the horses but with entries at Royal Ascot we view it in an entirely different way, in that if people can achieve a premium at the sale they will take the money but if not they will go to Royal Ascot and we will be cheering those horses on as well. So we are very grateful for all the support and hope everyone enjoyed themselves.\u201d Beeby said the Kensington Palace sale, which is sponsored by the Qatari ruler, Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was intended more as a shop window with which to attract fresh money to horse racing in future years than to necessarily make money on the day. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting wealthy people from around the world. It\u2019s called the sport of kings for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s more accessible to everybody within the last 25 years or so with partnerships and syndications.\u201d While promising racehorses often sell for millions of pounds, the real money is in established winners\u2019 sperm, Beeby said. The world\u2019s most valuable horse is Fusaichi Pegasus, an American stallion, who was sold to John Magnier\u2019s Coolmore Stud for $60m (\u00a347m) soon after he won the Kentucky Derby in 2000. Fusaichi Pegasus\u2019s stud fee was once $150,000 a time, but has declined as he has aged and his offspring have failed to live up to his promise. \u201cIn their prime, a stallion will mate with \u2013 we call it covering \u2013 in the stud season [between February and July] three or four mares a day,\u201d Beeby said. \u201cProbably the world\u2019s greatest stud at the moment is a horse called Galileo. He will be covering that amount of mares.\u201d Beeby estimated that Galileo would have easily sired at least 1,000 horses. \u201cIt\u2019s not very romantic. It is literally over in seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of chat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
