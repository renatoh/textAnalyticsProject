The capital's long-held status as the unofficial headquarters of world sport is under threat because cricket's ruling body, the International Cricket Council, is preparing to leave London and move to Dubai. The Cheltenham-based International Badminton Federation also decided last month to abandon the UK, where it has been based since it was founded in 1934, in favour of Kuala Lumpur. And the International Sailing Federation is being privately wooed to transfer its head office from Southampton to Monaco. The sports ruling bodies are being lured away by cash grants, tax concessions and other perks which the UK Treasury has refused to match. 2012 bid officials, anxious about the impact on Britain's international sporting reputation, have lobbied ministers to stop the exodus, but without success. The ICC's impending move from the game's spiritual home at Lord's cricket ground in St John's Wood, London, is a particular blow because the ruling bodies of rugby, athletics and table tennis have all left Britain since 1993. A London 2012 Olympic bid insider said: 'These latest departures are bad news for our chances. Britain has a special place in the history of sport because we invented so many sports ... It's in the country's interest to keep them here, because they help promote a positive image of Britain abroad.' Richard Caborn, the sports minister, is meeting ICC president Ehsan Mani in a last-ditch attempt to stop the organisation moving to the Middle East. But the Treasury's refusal to make the ICC exempt from corporation tax if it moved its commercial operations to Lord's from the tax haven of Monte Carlo means a reprieve is unlikely. The 2012 bid source said: 'Britain has little enough influence in the corridors of power in international sport without losing any more governing bodies. The government insists on seeing these organisations as normal profit-making businesses and fails to see that their profits are put back into developing their sports' grassroots.' Britain is in a five-city battle with Paris, Madrid, New York and Moscow for the right to stage the Olympics in 2012. The International Olympic Committee will choose the host city on 6 July. Mike Lee, London's 2012 bid communications chief, said the ICC's likely move would not damage the capital's chances because cricket is not an Olympic sport. 'This isn't a matter for the bid and has no significance for the bid,' he said. 'The minister is not pursuing this at the bid's request. But clearly it's a matter for the government and the cricket authorities'. But Labour MP Derek Wyatt, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary London 2012 Group of MPs and peers, said: 'It matters little that cricket isn't in the Olympics. Senior ICC members will talk to their country's IOC member and say that Britain, London or the British Government doesn't care enough about sport, or has been unhelpful. Therefore, in this sensitive six-month period before the vote on 2012, this could be damaging because it creates the impression that the government doesn't understand sport yet is bidding for the Olympics.' The problem has caused tension in Whitehall. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the quango UK Sport both argued that sports bodies should be given tax concessions but the Treasury rejected the proposal. 'Britain has been home to many international sporting bodies for years, and we are proud of that', said Caborn. 'Despite some of them deciding to relocate, we are still home to more of them than all our competitors in the 2012 race put together. It is all part of sport's globalisation.' denis.campbell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
