In a statement to the Stock Exchange the trustees said they currently enjoyed \"a strong and constructive relationship\" with the company, which has a \"strong and secure covenant\". But they warned that the scheme's \u00a3400m deficit could swell to \u00a33bn and said a private equity takeover financed with multibillion-pound debt \"would naturally have implications for the trustees' approach to security, the funding position and the appetite for risk\". The trustees, whose job is to protect the pensions of former and current employees, have asked to see full details of how the private equity consortium stalking the chain intends to run the business if it wins control. They have demanded access to its full business plan to assess how much the private equity groups could pay in to the pension scheme and to calculate the risk of a financial failure. \"They need to know how secure the money is,\" said one source familiar with the situation. In last night's statement the trustees said the scheme had a deficit of \u00a3410m - although a three-yearly funding valuation is under way - and they had an eight-year plan with the company to fund it. They warned, however, that \"a highly leveraged private equity proposal\" would change their thinking. If the schemes were forced to adopt more conservative policies with lower returns, they said, the deficit could reach \u00a31bn. In the worst possible circumstances - if the consortium made no further payments into the scheme and it had to pay out pensions for the next 60 years - the deficit could be up to \u00a33bn. The consortium - which comprises CVC, Texas Pacific, KKR and Blackstone - met the Sainsbury's pension fund trustees, led by former Sainsbury's HR director John Adshead, and their newly retained advisers, Penfida Partners, last week. The consortium has been mulling a bid for seven weeks, and has been given a Takeover Panel deadline of April 13 to make an offer or walk away. It is said to be considering a 550p bid, which would value the grocer at \u00a39.5bn. At least one other potential bidder - a second private equity consortium led by Bain &amp; Co - is circling. Last night the shares were changing hands at 549.5p, down 0.5p. The trustees are understood to have told the consortium that its financial plan must rank its pension scheme obligations ahead of its bank lenders in the event of an insolvency. Such a move has not been used by any trustees in the past and could have implications on the price the consortium would have to pay for its lending facilities - and therefore the price the bidders might eventually offer. Trustees have the power to stop any bid in its tracks. If they do not have sufficient confidence in a bidder they can make demands for deal-breaking cash injections. Failure to agree a deal with pension trustees ended Permira's hopes of buying WH Smith and contributed to billionaire Philip Green's abortive attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer three years ago. However, one source close to the consortium described the possibility of a \u00a33bn deficit as \"a fantasy number which assumes the consortium would make no payments at all, when they have already indicated that is not the case\". It is understood the consortium has suggested it is prepared to make an upfront payment of more than \u00a3300m and stated it is committed to eliminating the deficit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
