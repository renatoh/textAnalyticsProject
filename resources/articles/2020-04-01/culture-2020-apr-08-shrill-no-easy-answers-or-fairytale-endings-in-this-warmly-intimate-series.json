The show is based on the writer Lindy West\u2019s 2016 memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. A writer for an alt-weekly that mirrors Seattle\u2019s the Stranger \u2013 the publication West wrote for in the early days of her career \u2013 Annie was high on the adrenaline of confronting her troll and hurling a pot plant through his window. As she sprinted away with a triumphant smile on her face, his response echoed after her: \u201cYou better run, you fat bitch!\u201d The first season, which followed Annie\u2019s journey to accept, love and no longer be defined by her body, was bookended by people calling her these words; in episode one it was a trainer encouraging Annie to sign up for workouts. But with her body acceptance journey seemingly realised, the show needed to take Annie somewhere else. One place it takes her, in the best episode of TV I\u2019ve seen so far this year, is a pastel pink \u201cempowerment conference\u201d called WAHAM: Women Are Having A Moment. Based on events like the Goop summit West covered for the Guardian in 2017, it paints a glaring picture of contemporary and commercialised feminism, where attendees pay thousands of dollars to listen to panels full of people spouting empty catchphrases. In the conference\u2019s thoroughfares they can spend even more: on expensive novelty dildos, makeup to cover their supposedly gross legs, and T-shirts that aren\u2019t available in plus sizes. Annie takes it all in, has a brief and revealing conversation with the conference\u2019s \u201cshe-EO\u201d (played by Bryant\u2019s SNL co-star Vanessa Bayer, who has \u201chate in her eyes through a smile\u201d), and returns to the office struggling to reckon with both the price tag put on self-care, and the ultimate act of self-care she performed for herself in season one when she chose to have an abortion. With its accomplished writing staff, which includes Bryant, West, essayist Samantha Irby and SNL writer Sudi Green, Shrill is a show that seems uniquely positioned to put its characters in situations in which they genuinely need to weigh up, say, feeling disheartened by pink-washed politics and recognising that, for many women outside major cities, this is their only exposure to feminist communities. It also refuses to offer easy answers or tie up stories neatly. Annie\u2019s dopey, disappointing but well-meaning boyfriend, Ryan (Luka Jones), remains in the picture \u2013 but with increasingly little to show for it. This season of Shrill copped some criticism for the cycle of their relationship, where he\u2019s unable to step up and be an adult partner for her, and she moves on, believing him when he says he\u2019ll do better next time. A friend echoed a similar frustration to me over text when she binged the series, declaring that Annie is too good for him. But that kind of feels like the point. There\u2019s something incredibly revealing in seeing how, when it comes to romance, fat women are implicitly instructed to receive the bare minimum \u2013 and be grateful for it. What plays out between Annie and Ryan on screen is a reflection of reality for a lot of women who look and feel like she does. And after finding confidence in herself throughout season one, this series culminates in her using that confidence to demand better for herself from her partner. Stacked up next to something like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 another series produced by American streaming service Hulu \u2013 Shrill\u2019s concerns seem comparatively minor. The chronicle of one woman in a sort-of bad job with a kinda-shitty boyfriend as she slowly acquires the confidence to see both \u2013 and the rest of her life \u2013 with more clear-eyed confidence seems tiny and low-stakes in the midst of a global catastrophe. But it\u2019s also intimate and personal, and encourages similar interrogation of the tiny, snowballing injustices we\u2019ve accepted because we feared the repercussions of making a fuss. \u2022 Shrill is currently available to stream in Australia on SBS On Demand"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
