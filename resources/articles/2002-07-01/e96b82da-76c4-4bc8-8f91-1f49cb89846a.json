During most school holidays, they use the same strategy as in term time to look after Jack, nine, six-year-old Georgia and Anna, two. 'One of us is up and working by 7am each day, and works until 2.30 or three; the other starts at 9 and works until 5pm or 6pm,' Montague. 'In the holidays one of us has to work shorter hours, or alternatively we take it in turns, each doing one day on and one day off. So we both cut down our work a bit.' This year Jack and Georgia are both spending four days at a summer camp run by Somerset County Council, where they will have the chance to do abseiling, horse riding and other activities; the cost is around \u00a3160 per child. Montague says they tend to avoid theme parks. They prefer to take the children to the seaside, cycling, or swimming in a local river. And Montague has decided that this year, for the first time, she will take most of the summer off. 'I want to have a summer of hanging out with them and not being under pressure,' she says. 'I have always gone back to work within three or four weeks after each of them was born - and because of the way we work, we go through periods where we do a lot in the evening after the children have gone to bed. So for once, I just want to enjoy it.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
