If things were pretty equal between the pair when they met on a summer golfing holiday, the power balance tilted dramatically beneath the unrelenting rain clouds which soaked the city\u2019s streets after they had rolled in from the Pennines. Yet if it was the greyest of afternoons for Burnley, Wilder\u2019s already shiny reputation as one of the Premier League\u2019s brightest emerging tactical minds received a further burnishing as his Sheffield United players demonstrated why they currently rank among the division\u2019s most interesting and entertaining teams. Enda Stevens\u2019s eye-catching interpretation of the left wing-back role during these South Yorkshire newcomers\u2019 rise to sixth place is a case in point. Not content with playing slick one-twos with Jack O\u2019Connell as the latter regularly burst past him in his capacity as an overlapping centre-half, Stevens created John Lundstram\u2019s first goal with a long pass Glenn Hoddle would have treasured. That perfectly weighted through ball down the left was met by David McGoldrick before Lys Mousset deftly touched his cut-back into the highly impressive Lundstram\u2019s on-rushing path. All that remained was for the unmarked scorer to place his shot low into the bottom corner. Fast, fluent and refreshingly direct, that goal was emblematic of United\u2019s play as Burnley were persistently second guessed and thoroughly outmanoeuvred. All sharp movement, varied passing range and marauding centre-halves, the Blades were slicing their guests to ribbons with ruthlessly efficiency. \u201cIt was a good day for us, we kept our shape out of possession well,\u201d said Wilder with typical understatement. \u201cIt\u2019s an accumulation of a few years\u2019 work.\u201d The visitors had still to direct a single effort on target when Lundstram delighted in demonstrating how it was done by scoring his second goal at the end of an attacking foray that proved very nearly a carbon copy of the opener\u2019s preamble. Once again Stevens really got things going and although Mousset could not quite control his fine, low, inch-perfect cross curved in from the left, he nudged it intelligently in the direction of Lundstram. As deja vu descended on Bramall Lane Dyche\u2019s defence again left the midfielder to make another late dash into the box and, demonstrating his finishing prowess, shoot, first-time and right footed, beyond Nick Pope. Goal number three was slightly different, even if Mousset again provided the vital prompt. In capitalising on James Tarkowski\u2019s concentration lapse, he left the defender looking as bewildered as a pickpocketed tourist. Fleck had no hesitation about accepting his invitation \u2013 delivered in the form of an exquisite reverse pass \u2013 to punish Pope with his left foot. The \u00a310m Wilder spent in transferring Mousset from Bournemouth during the summer was a fairly hefty investment for a club with recent memory of life in League One but appears a smart buy. The Frenchman \u2013 an exotic rarity in a predominately Anglo-Irish squad \u2013 rightly received a standing ovation when he was replaced by Billy Sharp. Dusk had descended and although Burnley were finally restricting their hosts to half chances, Dean Henderson\u2019s goal remained largely unthreatened. \u201cThey had more aggression, energy and edge than us,\u201d said Dyche, who disagreed with the VAR-approved decision not to award Burnley a penalty when Ben Mee\u2019s header hit Stevens\u2019s arm. \u201cThey were excellent, they forced us into mistakes and were miles better but we were poor. The first half was unacceptable. Our brains weren\u2019t working.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
