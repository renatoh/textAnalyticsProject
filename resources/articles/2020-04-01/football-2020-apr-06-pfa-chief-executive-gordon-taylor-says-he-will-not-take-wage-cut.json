Despite continued pressure from politicians, the issue of wage deferral or pay cuts for top-flight clubs remains unresolved after a week of talks. Another meeting between league representatives and the PFA ended without any resolution on Monday, with clubs inceasingly pursuing individual approaches. Running alongside these negotiations are efforts led by Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson to create a players\u2019 fund to contribute towards the NHS and community causes in the face of the pandemic. There has been no agreement on the level of contribution being undertaken by players but Taylor has contributed \u00a3500,000 and the PFA is donating a further \u00a31m. Speaking to the Guardian about wage drops for players, Taylor said: \u201cWhat [the players] are saying is that it needs every club in its own locality to work things out for themselves \u2013 you can\u2019t have one suit fitting all sizes because there is such a variance in income and expenditure. \u201cIt needs to be round the table with all the facts revealed and then I can assure you that players will come to a position that is mindful about keeping their club alive and in good health as well as their jobs alive.\u201d Asked if he would take a pay cut, Taylor said: \u201cThe PFA will make donations and the PFA is involved in the players\u2019 charity. At the moment the PFA position is that we will continue to be paying all our staff of over 60 in full.\u201d As clubs continue to formulate their own plans in response to the coronavirus crisis, Manchester United have written to their staff to confirm that all of their 900 full-time employees are to be paid as normal and that no one will be furloughed. Staff who are unable to work from home or have reduced hours have instead been encouraged to volunteer with the NHS or in their local communities. Burnley also confirmed they would not be furloughing staff or cutting wages, despite the prospect \u2013 according to their chairman, Mike Garlick \u2013 of a possible \u00a350m hole in club revenues. Elsewhere, David Moyes announced he would take a 30% cut in his wages at West Ham, becoming the third Premier League manager to do so after Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe and Graham Potter of Brighton. The prospect of a financially straitened future for all Premier League clubs continued to move closer, however, with the news that the online broadcaster DAZN, which holds the rights to stream matches in Brazil, Canada, Japan and Spain, had begun negotiations to suspend payments. DAZN said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss commercial conversations but we are, of course, in the process of working closely with partners to reach reasonable solutions given the unprecedented circumstances.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
