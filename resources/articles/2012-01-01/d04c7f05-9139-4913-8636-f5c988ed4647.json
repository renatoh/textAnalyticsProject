Jim Geraghty's digging into the actual context of the \"Greed is good\" speech that's become pop culture shorthand for the attitudes of the 1%. Jim notes that the monologue, from Oliver Stone's thunderingly earnest Wall Street, is delivered in service of getting the meek shareholders to \"hold the company's management responsible for terrible performance and a culture of waste and complacency\". He argues that Gordon Gekko could just as well be addressing the crowd in Zuccotti Park: Today, management has no stake in the company! All together, these men sitting up here own less than 3% of the company. And where does Mr Cromwell put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than 1%. You own the company. That's right, you, the stockholder. And you are all being royally screwed over by these, these bureaucrats, with their luncheons, their hunting and fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes. And it's true, I think? I wonder if this flipping of the meaning of the Gekko mantra isn't representative of how the championing of the 1% never works, message-wise. Not even Gordon Gekko tried to sell it, and he had enough charisma to pull off suspenders. Romney has trouble making khakis look casual. Romney's unselfconscious pride in Bain's slash-and-burn approach to revamping companies (\"we had to burn the village in order to save it\") has always been the most serious threat to his chances against Obama. It's been fascinating to watch \u2013 as the strongest negative argument against his nomination to begin with."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
