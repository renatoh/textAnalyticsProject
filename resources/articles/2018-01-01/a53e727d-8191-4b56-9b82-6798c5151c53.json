US investment firm H/2 Capital Partners, which owns the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 bonds, has agreed a \u201cstandstill\u201d deal that defers crippling interest payments, allowing time for a restructuring of the debt-laden company. Minority bondholders support this but a group holding about \u00a3100m of the debt have been angered by conditions attached to the deal, drawn up by H/2 and Four Seasons without their involvement. The row threatens to complicate rescue talks, which are already fraught due to icy relations between H/2 and Terra Firma, the private equity group that still owns Four Seasons. Terra Firm is seeking an exit after austerity cuts to local authority social care budgets and increased nursing costs rendered its debt-fuelled model unsustainable. Cheyne Capital, which has lent money to Four Seasons since 2006, said the standstill agreement includes terms that \u201cprejudice the contractual rights and position of the minority bondholders as well as the company\u201d. \u201cIf H2 cannot reach agreement with the company on terms that do not adversely impact the rights of the minority bondholders, then we would urge the company to seek alternative funding suitors to work with,\u201d it added. Continuing with the existing terms would limit Four Seasons\u2019 ability to secure the best restructuring deal during rescue talks due to continue over the next few months, the lender warned. M&amp;G, the investment arm of global insurer Prudential, is thought have similar concerns to Cheyne but declined to comment. H/2 also declined to comment. Sources close to minority bondholders stressed that the dispute will not put at risk the survival of the company. Cheyne and fellow lenders are expected to argue that the agreement cannot be legally applied, which could complicate ongoing efforts to restructure the company\u2019s long-term finances. The dispute revolves around several key clauses, one of which prevents Four Seasons from repaying any other creditors without express permission from H/2. If Four Seasons were offered new cheap loans as part of the upcoming restructuring effort, it could not accept them unless H/2 allowed it to repay existing loans first, one source said. The agreement also allows H/2 to force Four Seasons to refinance its debt with an entity nominated by the US company. H/2 would also have the power to stop Four Seasons from paying interest to bondholders holding a higher ranking debt without paying those with lower ranking bonds. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
