Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team defeated Wigan Athletic 2-0 at the Emirates last night to reach the semi-finals of a competition the club last won in 1993, though they lost in the final to Chelsea three years ago. Arsenal have not won a trophy since the 2005 FA Cup but Den\u00edlson believes victory in the Carling Cup would lead to new heights. \"We are very happy because we won and Manchester United lost against West Ham, and we can win [the competition] this season,\" the midfielder said. \"People are saying we should be happy as Manchester lost and we have more opportunity to win the Carling Cup now. But we have to focus on every single game. If we focus on every single game we have a chance to win \u2013 not only the Carling Cup, but also the FA Cup, the Champions League and the Premier League, which are more important for us. If you win the Carling Cup then after will come the FA Cup, then after [the] Premier League and Champions League. \"It is a brilliant moment for us. I think we can win the Carling Cup this season, and I want to win because for five or six years we haven't won any trophies, but now we are a little bit stronger than last season.\" Den\u00edlson admitted the trophy drought makes it more imperative for the club to collect the Carling Cup. \"Yes, I think so,\" the Brazilian said. \"We have progressed and progressed from last season. Last season we lost some big games, and this season we are more experienced. We have a great team, we have young players but quality as well. We have a chance to win trophies this year. \"The boss talks to us all the time. He says it is more important that we have more focus in training and in games. It doesn't matter if you lose, but you have to be strong. We have many games this season, and you want to help and show for everyone how much you are important in a group. Sometimes I feel sad because people say that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger won't pay for experienced players or old players. But we have young players and we have character, and have a strong [team].\" The 22-year-old accepts that only by winning trophies and defeating the Premier League's most successful clubs can Arsenal be considered an elite team. \"Sometimes people say that Arsenal, when they play Chelsea or Manchester United, will lose the game. This year we can be stronger. In some games we have shown that we can win trophies. If you can win trophies people will believe in Arsenal,\" he said, before recalling the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in the 2007 Carling Cup final. \"We were winning 1-0 [through a Theo Walcott goal], and after they scored twice through [Didier] Drogba. I was 18 years old, that was a hard moment, but Chelsea were a bit stronger. They had brilliant players like Drogba, [Michael] Essien, [Frank] Lampard in this game, but I think we have to win it this year.\" Robin van Persie made his latest comeback against Wigan after Wenger had ordered him to work on his conditioning and Den\u00edlson believes the Holland striker can only strengthen the team's quest. \"We are happy because he is back. He is very important for us, he is a striker. He is a brilliant, amazing player. He has helped us a lot as well,\" the midfielder said, before insisting that Cesc F\u00e1bregas's absence due to his problematic hamstrings can be overcome. \"I think every player is very important for us. If it is next year or next month, some players can be injured as there are many games. It is difficult. We have to work and give 100% in training and have the preparation to play. Then the boss will give us the opportunity and we have to take it. But I hope Cesc is back soon because we need him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
