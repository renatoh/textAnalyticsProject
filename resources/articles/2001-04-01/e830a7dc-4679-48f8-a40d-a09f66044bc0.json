Ministers confirmed yesterday that bookings are down 10% across the country and up to 80% in the worst hit areas of Cumbria and Devon. The loans package is designed to tide the industry over its growing cash crisis, but is unlikely to be seen as enough by the many small rural tourist businesses on the edge of collapse. The English regional tourist boards estimate they are losing \u00a3200m a week in revenue, and the figure could be four times greater over Easter, which often represents as much as 10% of the industry's annual takings. The loans will be announced by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, alongside \u00a36m in subsidies to increase marketing by the English Tourism Council and the British Tourism Authority. Mr Smith warned the cabinet yesterday that the danger of \"significantly reduced\" bookings for the summer was now serious. The package has been worked up in urgent talks between the Department of Culture, Downing Street and the Treasury. The money is on top of existing rate relief and VAT holidays. The Conservatives are likely to claim that the package follows their own call for interest free loans of up to \u00a310,000. The tourist industry will claim the assistance is dwarfed by the huge compensation payments being prepared for farmers. But as President Bush told the Scottish first minister, Henry McLeish, in Washington that he \"empathised with the UK\" - and the European parliament snubbed Britain by voting overwhelmingly to call for a review of the non-vaccination policy - there were clear signs that government was becoming deeply frustrated at local councils in unaffected parts of the country. Mr Blair has already met council leaders to urge them to take a common sense approach to footpath closures but large areas still have blanket bans. The government found an unexpected ally in Sir Sean Connery, who was in Washington. \"You will find our majestic countryside open,\" he said. Agriculture minister Nick Brown, who told cabinet members that he would be spending much of the Easter holidays at his ministry's headquarters, advised caution however, saying that the epidemic might be levelling off but no risks could be taken. \"This is a very serious outbreak which is likely to have a long tail,\" he told MPs as some pressed for faster cull-and-bury policies and others urged relaxation of restrictions on the movement of animals in unaffected areas. The problem facing vets was multiplied by the fact that for every reported case of foot and mouth confirmed, there were two that turned out to be false alarms, Mr Brown said. Compensation payments to farmers were now approaching \u00a3600 million, Downing Street said. About 1,600 soldiers are working on foot and mouth in 14 areas of the country.
