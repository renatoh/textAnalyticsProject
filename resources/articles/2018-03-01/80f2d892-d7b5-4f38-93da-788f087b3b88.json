The group, which comprise on- and off-screen staff from across the BBC, have co-signed an open letter calling on the BBC director general, Tony Hall, to deliver on his promise to make the corporation the \u201cmost transparent organisation when it comes to pay\u201d. The signatories argue that Hall\u2019s new strategy to tackle pay inequality and discrimination will not solve the problem, and claim that management is dragging its feet. Hall announced a five-point plan in January following the publication of a review by PwC of pay for on-air staff, which prompted a major backlash by concluding there was no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making. \u201cIt\u2019s time for full pay transparency at the BBC,\u201d the letter states. \u201cTransparency about what everyone earns, about how pay is decided, and also about promotion and recruitment across all areas of the corporation. Our pay structure is likely to flatten as very high salaries become harder to justify. It\u2019s the fastest, cheapest, fairest way to begin to tackle unequal pay at the BBC.\u201d The BBC has said it will improve by providing more information using \u201cnarrower pay bands\u201d that it claims will mean \u201ceveryone will be able to see the pay range for virtually every job\u201d. The signatories argue that the only way to fix the problem, which they say has \u201ceroded trust and morale\u201d in the BBC, is to provide more granular information, including on benefits such as pensions, that can mask major differences in pay deals. \u201cThe BBC spends public money,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe public deserves to know how that money is spent.\u201d They are also critical of the failure to include payments to staff through entities such as BBC Studios, which makes shows including Strictly Come Dancing, DIY SOS, EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City, because it is classed as a commercial entity and does not have to provide such information. \u201cPublication of individual salaries and benefits, and other payments through BBC Studios and all commercial arms, would have a lasting positive impact on the culture of the BBC and beyond,\u201d the letter says. \u201c[Full transparency] is by far the most effective way to uncover pay discrimination of all kinds, against ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, or on the basis of age or any other legally protected characteristic.\u201d In January, Carrie Gracie, who was the BBC\u2019s China editor and one of its most senior journalists, resigned from her post accusing the corporation of having a \u201csecretive and illegal\u201d pay culture. She has also signed the letter, along with other well-known on-air talent including journalist, writer and broadcaster Samira Ahmed, foreign correspondent Orla Guerin, political correspondent Chris Mason and the Radio 4 newsreaders Neil Sleat and Zeb Soanes. Last year, the BBC Women campaign group, which represents more than 170 presenters and producers including household names such as Mishal Husain and Jane Garvey, dismissed the BBC\u2019s \u201cno gender bias\u201d report and criticised it for not tackling equal pay. In October, a review of salaries at the broadcaster found that men were being paid 9.3% more than women on average, and that nearly 500 employees may have been earning less than colleagues in similar roles simply because of their gender. The average gender pay gap for full-time workers in the UK was 9.1% in 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. The review found there was \u201cno systemic discrimination against women\u201d at the BBC, but it did not take into account the vast majority of on-air presenters, editors and senior managers. The issue has been in the headlines since last summer, when a review into star pay revealed that just a third of the BBC\u2019s 96 highest-paid stars were women, and the top seven were all men. The Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans topped the list with a salary of more than \u00a32m, while the highest-paid woman was Strictly\u2019s Claudia Winkleman in the \u00a3450,000-\u00a3499,999 pay bracket. \u201cWe love the BBC and believe in its values and transparency and accountability,\u201d the open letter concludes. \u201cWe want to work with you to help the BBC live up to those values, and to restore the trust of staff and audiences in the BBC\u2019s stated commitments.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe already have a project planned to look at transparency at the BBC, which will consider, among other things, whether all salaries from the licence fee should be published and what other measures are necessary that wouldn\u2019t put the BBC at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cThe BBC already publishes more information about itself, its operations and its staff than any other broadcaster. We are already committed to going further and faster than any other organisation in closing our gender pay gap. We have set out real targets and have announced a project led by Donalda MacKinnon to do all we can to help the progression and culture for women within the organisation. \u201cBBC Studios and Worldwide are fully commercial businesses and are not funded by the licence fee. It\u2019s not public money. They have to compete in the commercial market on a level playing field against other commercial business. It would be wrong to put them at a competitive disadvantage at a time when we should be doing all we can to support British content against the global west coast giants.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
