He may have begun his final round six hours earlier than he had when winning at Carnoustie and then Birkdale, but at least he was still involved on the Sunday and despite signing for a 12-over-par 292, the Irishman said he would win more majors. His next opportunity comes with the defence of the US PGA Championship, at Hazeltine from 13 August. \"I know I will come back and compete in more Opens, and I will win some more majors,\" said the 37-year-old, whose swing tinkering contributed to him missing the cut in six of his previous eight tournaments before arriving here looking to become the first player since Peter Thomson in the 50s to win three in a row. \"The key now is to be ready for the PGA and that's really what I'm looking at going forward from here,\" he said following a final-round three-over 73. Heading for home long before the leaders even teed off, Harrington commented: \"As I said about this week, I would have liked it to be in another couple of weeks' time. The PGA is in another couple of weeks' time and I believe my game will be good and strong going into that.\" Harrington may have believed his game was ready after a first-round 69 left him only five strokes behind the leader. Two birdies and a solitary bogey suggested that his swing coach had worked his magic in time for the student's first tilt at the Ailsa course in Bob Torrance's native Ayrshire. Friday's four-over 74 was enough to scrape into the weekend on the cut mark and Saturday began brightly with a birdie, but five bogeys and a double bogey followed to ensure, in a tie for 64th at nine over, the defending champion would not \u2013 for the first time in three years \u2013 be in contention on the final day. The Dubliner, who has just one top-five finish on the European Tour this year, would not have wanted to relinquish his grip on the Claret Jug early on Sunday afternoon with a 73 featuring five bogeys and two birdies, but the world No14 by-passed sanguine and went straight to optimistic. \"It's come to an end. It's been a good two years being Open champion, but inevitably it would [end],\" he said. \"This is one of those weeks I'd put into the category of 'OK, it wasn't my week' \u2013 compared to other weeks where I haven't played so well. Going forward, I would have no trouble playing competitive golf the way I played it this week.\" He moved to something more fanciful with the assertion that his game is superior now to 12 months ago, when he was a back-to-back Open champion on the verge of becoming the first European winner of the US PGA Championship. \"There is still stuff to work on, no doubt. But I would still say I am better now than I was a year ago,\" he said. \"I'm much more positive now than I was last month.\" Everyone, from Harrington's postman to Tom Watson, has offered an opinion on his swing adjustment. Watson had said: \"I look at Padraig Harrington right now, he shortened his swing and I think he's having troubles because of it. I liked the length of the swing last year, and now he's shortened the swing and he's having a hard time with it. You lose your rhythm when you shorten the swing.\" \"It is very nice that [Watson] would take time out and give a helping hand,\" Harrington said. \"I'm a great believer, as Bob Torrance is, that your swing finds its natural length as Tom Watson's swing has found its natural length ... but I have never tried to shorten my swing.\" Where others would become exasperated, Harrington becomes fascinated and the affable Irishman is enjoying the search for this elusive natural length. \"[I don't find it] a little bit trying at all. I like all this stuff, I'm intrigued by it all. I always want to get better and this is a way of getting better,\" he said. \"I will be a better player at the end of all this. I will have the last laugh.\" He may have lost the Claret Jug but the smile remains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
