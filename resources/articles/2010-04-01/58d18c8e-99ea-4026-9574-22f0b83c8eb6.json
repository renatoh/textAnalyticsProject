Iain Dowie's side sit third bottom of the Premier League, three points adrift of safety, but the interim manager remains optimistic relegation can be avoided. 'This week has got to bring at least one win; beating Villa would change the whole picture,' Dowie, below, whose team face Sunderland at the KC Stadium on Saturday, said yesterday. 'And if we were able to put back-to-back wins together, then we're really cooking on gas. That would put real pressure on West Ham.' The former West Ham forward has decided the best way of discomfiting Gianfranco Zola's similarly relegation\u2011threatened side is to proceed with caution. Dowie's new\u2011look 4\u20115\u20111 formation produced a point in Saturday's goalless draw at Birmingham and he pronounced himself well pleased. 'We passed the ball better than at any time this year,' he said. 'We made 70 more passes than we've made in a game all season.\" With the matches against Villa and Sunderland followed by a trip to Wigan and the visit of Liverpool, he believes superior possession retention is preferable to gambling on twin forwards. \"People can ask for two strikers,\" he said. \"And that's fine when strikers are scoring but ours have got nine goals between them all season. \"And I'm not sure going 4-4-2 against Aston Villa's 4-4-2 would be right. Villa are as good a counter attacking side as anyone in the country and Martin O'Neill says they are looking to win here. If you just attack Villa that's suicide, look at their goal threat.\" Not that Dowie is daunted. \"If you worry about Villa you wouldn't sleep,\" he said. \"But we've got to play to our strengths. We've got to make Agbonlahor, Carew, Downing, Young and Milner look like average players. We need to expose one or two weaknesses they have.\" He trusts patience will prove a key weapon in Hull's armoury and hopes his team can pass their way to safety. \"We have to hang on in games and keep a foothold. I'd like to see us building our passing game and giving Villa something to worry about.' Louise Taylor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
