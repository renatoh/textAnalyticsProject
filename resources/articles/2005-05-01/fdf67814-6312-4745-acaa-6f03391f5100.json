The Finnish company raised nearly \u00a340m to fund the development of biodegradable implants used in bone repair and said two months ago that it planned to double sales of the implants this year. The company warned yesterday that sales were \"significantly below\" its expectations and meeting its targets would require a rapid improvement in trading performance. The news came as Australian firm EpiTan, which is developing a \"suntan in a pill\" treatment to protect against skin cancer, had to pull its proposed listing on Aim. It cited a \"deterioration in the investment climate\". Other Scandinavian firms had been considering following in the footsteps of Inion and insiders said their path was more treacherous after Inion's warning. Planned flotations from scar treatment firm Renovo and the speciality pharmaceutical company Prostrakan, which are seeking to raise \u00a3150m between them, are also expected to come under pressure. Inion chief executive, Dr Auvo Kaikkonen, said yesterday that the company's distribution partners had not produced the sales they were contracted to do but surgeons and patients liked its products. \"Of course it is a horrible situation to be in. We definitely perceive the share price fall as an over-reaction.\" Inion shares tumbled 46% to close at 79p, wiping \u00a350m off the value of the company. \"We believe the prospects for the products remain very good, it's just the timescale for reaching them has been pushed out,\" said Erling Refsum, an analyst at Japanese investment bank Nomura, in a note to clients. Nomura is the house broker. He added that surgeons who use the products require a lot of persuading to move from metal plates, which have been used for a long time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
