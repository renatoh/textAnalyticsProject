Kellyanne Conway gained immortality with \u201calternative facts\u201d. Sean Spicer used his first briefing as White House press secretary to inflate the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. His successor, Sarah Sanders, admitted to lying to reporters about the firing of the FBI director James Comey. The press secretary Stephanie Grisham never lied from the White House podium \u2013 because she never held a press briefing. So when the latest incumbent, Kayleigh McEnany, on Friday held the first such briefing in 417 days, the Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin had a question: \u201cWill you pledge to never lie to us from that podium?\u201d Without missing a beat, McEnany replied: \u201cI will never lie to you. You have my word on that.\u201d Expect to hear replays of that line before this presidency is done. Even on what proved an assured debut, McEnany skated close to peddling dodgy information about Trump\u2019s responses to the coronavirus pandemic (\u201cThis president has always sided on the side of data\u201d) and to allegations of sexual misconduct (\u201cHe has always told the truth\u201d). But the good news for the White House is that McEnany, 32, benefits by comparison with the desperately low standards of both her boss and her predecessors. Over the past month Trump has been a verbal cannon of insults, mendacity, miracle cures, self-aggrandisement and self-pity, culminating in a proposal about bleach injection to fight Covid-19 that caused him to be metaphorically led away by men in white coats. Spicer, who turned up at his first briefing in an oversized jacket and a foul mood, often resembled a rabbit caught in headlights, sealing his fate by claiming Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons. Sanders was an aggressive propagandist on her boss\u2019s behalf. Grisham was missing in action. But McEnany, a devout Christian dressed in black and wearing a cross around her neck, who set down a binder of notes on a lectern that last year literally gathered dust, has plenty of TV experience and is a more polished performer than any of them. Set against Trump\u2019s word salads, she sounded like a model of concision. Set against his temperament, she was the calm after the storm. She described Trump as \u201cthe most accessible president in history\u201d and insisted his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who recently called the administration\u2019s response to a pandemic which has killed 63,000 Americans a success story, \u201chas done a great job\u201d. She echoed Trump\u2019s accusation that the World Health Organization \u201cpraised China\u2019s leadership on the 22nd and 23rd\u201d of January, without mentioning that on 22 January Trump tweeted \u201cTerrific working with President Xi\u201d and on 24 January wrote: \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.\u201d Thankfully for McEnany, reporters were too polite to point out her own remark on 25 February: \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here.\u201d On the contrast between sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh, she called the latter \u201ca grave miscarriage of justice\u201d so forcefully one might have assumed Kavanaugh had been destroyed, rather than now sitting on the supreme court. McEnany also went on the offensive over the FBI\u2019s handling of the case against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, suggesting it should \u201cshould scare every American\u201d and parroting Trump\u2019s refrain of \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d. When Jon Karl of ABC News asked about it, she tried to turn the tables: \u201cDoes it trouble you that the FBI said, \u2018We\u2019ve gotta get Flynn to lie?\u2019 Doesn\u2019t that trouble you as a journalist and, not only that, as an American citizen?\u201d Karl replied dryly: \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly something worth reporting. It\u2019s not my job to say whether or not it\u2019s troubling.\u201d McEnany arched her left eyebrow at that. She also proved adept on the most important aspects of any press secretary\u2019s job: the art of saying nothing. There were plenty of \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of the president\u201d deflections. As for policy depth, which is what the briefings are meant be about, that remains to be seen. Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, tweeted: \u201cObjectively @kayleighmcenany is doing the best job (so far) at the podium for @realDonaldTrump than anyone else who has served as @PressSec ... her experience on cable news makes her a far more seasoned spokesperson than her predecessors.\u201d From the Trump team\u2019s point of view, Bardella added, \u201cshe is poised, capable, on-message, in-command, prepares and a very effective communicator\u201d. Mark Meadows, the new White House chief of staff who has shaken up the communications operation, will probably be pleased. But it was McEnany\u2019s sign-off that was perhaps the most revealing insight into what she called her \u201cmission to bring you the mindset of the president\u201d. She declared: \u201cOf course, everyone should watch the Fox News town hall with the president from 7pm to 9pm [on Sunday]. It\u2019ll be can\u2019t-miss television \u2013 much like the highly rated President Trump coronavirus task force briefings have been.\u201d If Trump\u2019s attention span stretched to the end of the half-hour briefing, he will have been happy with that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
