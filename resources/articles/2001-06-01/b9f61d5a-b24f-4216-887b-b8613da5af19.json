Before the players could take off from La Manga for Athens their plane sat on the tarmac at Murcia for the better part of an hour. The reason given was that Athens airport had been closed for a visit by a VIP, who turned out to be the president of the former Yugoslavia. Well, that was an easy one to come up with wasn't it? Always beware of Greeks bearing excuses. As if that was barely plausible today has been declared the International Day of the Environment, when hotels here will enter the green spirit by shutting off their air-conditioning, discouraging guests from using lifts and dimming the lights. It all sounds like a plot to stiffen up the vulnerable muscles and joints of one Steven Gerrard, who has pulled out of England teams before after tedious flights, is carrying a thigh strain, and just needs to take a tumble down some dimly-lit stairwell to set himself back months. All joking apart - apart that is from the environmental stuff, which is absolutely serious - England do not want anything to upset the real but still vulnerable revival which Sven-Goran Eriksson's side has started to undergo. A win against Greece in the Olympic Stadium here tomorrow night, which would be the Swedish coach's fifth successive victory since taking over, would not only maintain the team's renewed hopes of World Cup qualification but would further convince England's followers that there is more to this latest rebirth than the usual false labour. David Seaman, for one, is convinced that the England of 2001 has a future beyond the first bad result. \"I've seen plenty of promising England teams,\" said the 37-year-old Arsenal goalkeeper, \"but the difference in this one is the number of players in it who are in the their early twenties. This is why I think the side has tremendous potential.\" Having shaken off a shoulder problem Seaman is set to return to the side having missed England's 4-0 win against Mexico at Derby 11 days ago, when Nigel Martyn played in the first half and David James took over for the second. In the season just ended the identity of Seaman's successor as England's first choice has been frequently discussed, but last night he showed no sign of moving aside just yet. \"So long as I keep performing I feel I'm OK,\" Seaman insisted. \"Now I'm just taking it season by season and seeing how I feel at the end of it. At the moment I don't feel any different keeping goal from the way I did five years ago. \"People say your reactions start to slow down but what about the extra experience? That must help your anticipation about where the ball is going. The difference is that you don't train so much because that does start to take a lot out of you.\" Michael Owen, 16 years Seaman's junior, joined the growing chorus from Eriksson's squad which is convinced that the way the coach's first choices came together in the first half against Mexico represents a take-off point in qualifying for the World Cup. Only Gerrard did not join in England's practice session yesterday morning, although he did train in the gym at La Manga. But he is expected to be back to normal today. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
