She applied to Student Finance England for this current year. Because my wife and I have a low income, she is entitled to a means-tested top-up. Student Finance wrote to us some months ago asking to see our P60s as evidence. I don't get one, but went online, which is in itself a nightmare of access codes and impenetrable questions, and gave them the information I thought we were being asked for. Student Finance initially indicated it had the details it needed. But it is now well into the term and my daughter has no funds. She rang and asked why no money had arrived. It replied that until it received the P60s, it couldn't pay her. I have no idea how to access the system. Meanwhile, my daughter can't pay her fees or for accommodation and food. HB, Bristol We had another complaint about Student Finance in the same week yours came in, leading us to wonder whether something is happening at the body which administers loans to students on the government's behalf. A spokeswoman for Student Finance, which is part of the Student Loans Company, says the delays were, in part, caused by the fact it was still awaiting proof that your daughter was attending medical school. Fortunately, it quickly jumped into action and says it has worked with her to get the outstanding details it needed. \"We can confirm we have paid her funding and we wish her every success with her future studies,\" it says.
