It's something that Sharon, who now runs her own nutritional consultancy, had wanted to do since she was a secondary school teacher in an inner city. \"Many of the children I taught were in care and often I thought they weren't being looked after all that well,\" she says. \"I thought maybe I could do a better job.\" The catalyst occurred after the Okins moved to Oxfordshire and one of the council's foster carers became a client of Sharon's. After several months of assessment visits, form filling and training, Sharon and Stuart, a senior executive in a technology company, were approved this March to become respite and emergency carers for children aged three to 11. There is a UK-wide shortage of more than 10,000 foster carers, according to the charity the Fostering Network. As the traditional pool of foster carers (stay-at-home mums and empty-nesters) dwindles , the number of children coming into foster care is rising. Fostering services desperately need young, professional couples like Sharon and Stuart to consider fostering, along with people from certain ethnic minorities, gay and lesbian people and single people. Oxfordshire county council is one of the fostering services that is leading the way in achieving these aims. Over the past year and a half, Oxfordshire has revamped its recruitment. A new fostering and adoption recruitment officer, Helen Oliver, was appointed in January 2005 and the recruitment budget was doubled. Oliver then overhauled the recruitment strategy and began to boost the recruitment activity through reintroducing information sessions for potential carers, building up press coverage and revising the adverts. It is crucial, she believes, to build up trust with people. \"It is important that people know that you will value their skills and support them if they become foster carers,\" she says. \"We need to be friendly and to listen to their needs.\" This openness was one of the qualities that attracted the Okins to working with Oxfordshire. Many people rule themselves out of fostering thinking that their house isn't big enough, they don't have the right skills or they are the wrong sort of person. Oxfordshire is combating such myths through its adverts and early conversations with potential carers. Oliver says: \"We are emphasising that what we want is families who know what children and young people are like, and who will stick with them. They might not need as much space in their house or to be as rich as they think.\" In Oxfordshire, the new investment and revised approach is beginning to bear fruit. During 2005, the number of inquiries from potential foster carers rose by around 100. However, Oliver points out that it will take time to meet the target of 20 new carers each year. It costs around \u00a311,500 to recruit a new fostering household, including the cost of advertising, preparation and assessment. Sharon and Stuart, though, are sure to prove their worth over the coming years. Their first foster child visited last month - a seven-year-old boy who they took to the cinema for his first time. Sharon says: \"The reality is even better than they say. You are bringing experiences to a child that they would never otherwise have had. To make a child feel safe and to put them into an environment where they can grow and thrive - nothing compares with that.\" \u00b7 For more on recruiting foster carers go to www.fostering.net/england/akc.php"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
