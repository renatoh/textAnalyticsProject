The Belgium midfielder has recovered from a knee ligament injury and has been in full training throughout the international break. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to play,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe has been training well and without pain, so I will probably give him some time in the next game. He might not be ready to play 90 minutes but we are all keen to see him back in action. Kevin is a very important player for us.\u201d De Bruyne\u2019s chances of playing are increased by injury to Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who will be out for a couple more weeks, though Fabian Delph is fit if required to face Burnley, described by Guardiola as \u201cmasters of the long ball and second ball game\u201d. City\u2019s manager was pleased to see Raheem Sterling score two goals for England in midweek but thinks the player can still get better. \u201cRaheem\u2019s mentality is stronger than before, and I thought that before he scored the goals for England,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe is only 23 years old and he knows he can still improve some more.\u201d The former City youngster Jadon Sancho made his England debut in the previous game against Croatia, and Guardiola, though disappointed to lose the winger to Borussia Dortmund, believes interest in his players from other countries is an inevitable fact of modern life. \u201cEnglish teams are looking at young players in Spain and Italy, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cLosing a player can happen. We wanted to keep Sancho, we did everything we could, but he was keen to start his career in Germany. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s doing well there, and though you never know what might happen in football I doubt if he\u2019s thinking of coming back here. When he was here he didn\u2019t want to stay, so I don\u2019t believe he will be thinking of a return.\u201d Guardiola added that his door is always open should Thierry Henry require advice in his new position as manager of Monaco. The pair were together when Guardiola was in charge of Barcelona and have remained friends, though the City manager feels Henry should be under no illusions about the size of the task he has taken on. Monaco eliminated City from the Champions League less than two seasons ago, yet most of their best players have moved on since then \u2013 some of them to City \u2013 and Henry\u2019s new side sit third from bottom of the French league. \u201cI wish Thierry all the best \u2013 it is a huge experience to start out on a managerial career,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cRight now Monaco is not in a good position but I think Thierry is going to do well in his new job.\u201d \u201cThierry will notice a big difference between football management and working as a pundit. Now he will have to work every single day, but at least the weather is nice in Monaco. If he wants to come over to Manchester anytime to look at how we do things, he\u2019s always invited.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
