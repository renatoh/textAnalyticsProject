That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Isaac Hayden speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put into words, the feeling we\u2019ve got. We thought we deserved the points. It looked a foul from the bench. I think the referee had played 94 and 52 seconds. It\u2019s another bit of bad luck. I thought we deserved the three points. It\u2019s one of those disappointing moments. Martin Dubravka\u2019s a top class goalkeeper. There\u2019s going to be no blame laid at his door. I made a mistake at the beginning of the season against Cardiff away and got sent off and almost cost the team.\u201d Newcastle might be annoyed about five minutes of added time, but everyone knows it\u2019s a minimum. They wasted the first minute with the Manquillo substitution and can have no complaints that Graham Scott kept playing after the allotted four minutes were up. Rafa Benitez looks absolutely furious, though it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s because of how much added time was added on, because he thought the equaliser should have been ruled out or because he\u2019s just annoyed with another costly error from Martin Dubravka. The Newcastle manager is livid. He\u2019s fuming as he walks off. It was a heartbreaking end for Newcastle, who were moments away from a crucial win before Willy Boly\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser. They were on course to rise to 13th thanks to a strike from Isaac Hayden; instead they find themselves a point above 18th-placed Southampton with 12 games to go. That\u2019s your lot! Adama Traore goes on one last surge down the right. He reaches the byline and hoicks a high cross to the far post. It should be Dubravka\u2019s. He should punch it away. But he tries to catch it and isn\u2019t strong enough. He makes a complete mess of it and that allows Boly to bundle it in with a combination of his head and chest! Dubravka appeals for a foul. There was no foul. Lascelles is furious with him. Wolves equalise! 90 min+5: Wolves pump the long ball forward. Jimenez sees a volley blocked. Then Ritchie blocks Traore\u2019s shot. And then... 90 min+4: One final corner for Wolves, won by Cavaleiro. It\u2019s headed away. 90 min+1: Newcastle eat some time with their third substitution, Ayoze Perez making way for Javi Manquillo. \u201cJust to add a woman\u2019s two penn\u2019th (a wife not a fianc\u00e9e), I would suggest mustard,\u201d Jill O\u2019Donnell says. 90 min: Almiron\u2019s cross is headed over by Perez. There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Moutinho\u2019s corner, Bennett\u2019s header, Dubravka\u2019s ball. 88 min: A corner to Wolves on the left. Boly almost gets his head to it in the six-yard box. Newcastle survive. Another corner.... 86 min: Mo Diame replaces Isaac Hayden, Newcastle\u2019s goalscorer. 82 min: Adama Traore replaces Matt Doherty. Wolves attack down the left, Cavaleiro twisting, turning and lifting a deep cross to the far post. Traore sidefoots it back into the middle and Jimenez heads woefully wide from close range! 81 min: Cavaleiro blasts over from 25 yards. Wolves are running out of ideas. 80 min: Wolves are getting Adama Traore ready. 78 min: Moutinho gives Almiron a rude introduction to English football, sliding to bring him down. A good old-fashioned reducer from, er, the silky Portuguese creator. 75 min: Hayden\u2019s receiving treatment after being fouled by Moutinho, which gives everyone a chance to have a breather. 72 min: This is what the Newcastle fans wanted to see: Miguel Almiron coming on to make his debut. The Paraguayan\u2019s given a huge cheer as he replaces Christian Atsu. 69 min: Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro come on for Diogo Jota and Leander Dendoncker. 68 min: Lascelles picks up a booking for a cynical trip on Jimenez. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned today it\u2019s that David Dein is in the habit of making assumptions,\u201d JR in Illinois says. \u201cNow he\u2019s assuming how my theoretical fiancee would react?! Also, while I\u2019m here, I can\u2019t let his calling Newcastle\u2019s kit \u201cteal\u201d go unchallenged. It\u2019s not teal. It\u2019s closer to cyan or possibly electric blue.\u201d 66 min: Helder Costa will be on for Wolves soon. 65 min: Jimenez manages to bustle to the byline on the right and pull a cross into the area. A ricochet sees the ball run to Doherty, whose shot hits his own man! Newcastle survive again. 61 min: \u201cSimon Kirchin\u2019s link confirms something I\u2019ve always thought, the best football kits were worn during the sixties,\u201d Tom Shaw says. \u201cSmart, trim and clean looking with no graphics apart from a club crest. Worth checking your club\u2019s out and comparing it with the cluttered monstrosity they probably were today.\u201d 59 min: Jota with the shot again, Dubravka with the shot again. This could be a long 30 minutes or so for Newcastle. 57 min: Wolves look for an instant response, but Jota sees his shot from 18 yards saved by Dubravka, diving low to his right. This is a really well worked goal, though Rui Patricio has let himself down here. The move begins with Fabian Schar setting off on one of his trademark runs from deep. This time he decides not to shoot. Instead he slides a brilliant pass through to Hayden on the right, cutting Wolves open, and the midfielder\u2019s shot manages to squirm past Patricio, who really should have kept it out. Not that Newcastle care. That could be a huge goal for them. Newcastle snatch the lead! 53 min: Dubravka claims the corner. 52 min: Wolves are setting a brisk pace and Jota wins a corner on the left. 51 min: There\u2019s a minor row between Schar and Jota, both of whom get yellow cards after jutting heads together. 48 min: Wolves are o the front foot straight away, Jimenez playing a one-two with Jota and bursting into the area, but Lascelles manages to deflect the Mexican\u2019s shot wide for a corner. From which a flick-on from Jota at the near post should lead to the opening goal for Doherty. The Irish wing-back\u2019s only a yard out, but he\u2019s under pressure from Longstaff and manages to head over the bar! What a miss! 46 min: Wolves get the second half underway. Half-time emails \u201cHere you go, Wolves kits through the ages,\u201d Simon Kirchin says. \u201cKnock yourself out......\u201d \u201cIs Yedlin always this poor or is he having a particularly bad game today?\u201d Peter Campbell says. \u201cIs David Dein confused with the eponymous USA pretzel snack of Rold Gold, which being baked are consequently a much darker shade than the Wolves kit,\u201d C Johnston says. \u201cCall it amber, call it yellow, call it orange, that all rather misses the point,\u201d David Dein says. \u201cIf you got engaged and presented a fiancee with a ring that colour &amp; claimed it was old gold you can pretty much guarantee that she\u2019ll be departing in the kind of funk that would make Kevin Keegan proud and probably never to be seen again. Btw, Newcastle are in teal.\u201d It\u2019s been very tight. Not too many chances at either end. I\u2019ve seen worse games, though. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min: Perez slips a pass through to Rondon, who runs at Coady and tries to make room for a shot. Just when Rondon seems ready to blast home with his left foot, Coady sticks out a leg to divert the shot over! 44 min: Ritchie goes down in the Wolves area after running into Doherty, enraging the home fans. The Newcastle player\u2019s also not too happy. He thought it was a penalty and tells the referee as much in no uncertain terms. All that gets him is a booking for dissent. 43 min: A cross from Ritchie from the left somehow reaches Rondon at the far post, but the Newcastle forward can\u2019t sort out his feet and loses the ball. To belabour the point about newcastle\u2019s kit,\u201d Neil Hattersley says. \u201cEvery time the TV cuts to a close up of one of their outfield players I just assume they have a new keeper I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d 41 min: Jonny smacks a low shot through the mass of bodies from 20 yards, but Dubravka plunges to his right to make a good save. He even holds on to the ball. A good goalkeeper, Dubravka, despite that mistake against Spurs last week. 40 min: Newcastle creep forward, pressing on the right, and Hayden sends a cross into the area. Rondon\u2019s more alert than anyone - but the former West Brom striker can only glance a header straight at Patricio. 37 min: \u201cThe bigger issue surely is what colour is the Newcastle kit?\u201d Steven Franklin says. \u201cYou called it blue in your preamble but I\u2019d be inclined to call it turquoise.\u201d 35 min: The second corner comes to nothing. Moments later Jimenez almost makes something out of nothing on the left after being picked out by a raking pass from Neves. He tricks past Yedlin brilliantly, drives back from the byline, on to his right foot, and slams a low shot through the bodies. The ball\u2019s heading towards the far post, but Dubravka gets down to make the save. Jota can\u2019t do anything with the rebound. 34 min: Another Newcastle error in possession sparks another Wolves attack, which ends with Jimenez winning a corner on the right. Jota sends it in and Boly runs to the near post, only to see his header hit a Newcastle man and fly over. 32 min: Newcastle have their first decent attack of the evening. Sort of. Schar sends one wide from 25 yards. 30 min: Newcastle haven\u2019t been out of their half in any constructive way for a while. It\u2019s all Wolves. But Dubravka hasn\u2019t had to make a save yet. \u201cThat definitive guide to football kits, the 1960\u2019s Subbuteo catalogue lists Wolves shirts as Old Gold,\u201d Tom Shaw says. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me. 27 min: Wolves have had quite a few promising situations on the edge of the Newcastle area, only to botch the final pass. Their latest attack ends with Dendoncker curling over from 25 yards. They need more composure. 25 min: Wolves have had a good few minutes and are making most of the running. Newcastle\u2019s objective, you sense, is to kill the game. There\u2019s a danger it could run away from them if Wolves get the first goal soon. 23 min: A fascinating development is taking place in my inbox. \u201cNot to throw a monkey wrench (or \u201cspanner\u201d as you would call it) into David Dein\u2019s world view but I\u2019m not from (and have never even been to) the U.K. and I would not say Wolves are wearing orange,\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019d call it amber.\u201d What have you done, David Dein? 20 min: \u201cIf you are hurting for quality emails let me express my retort to emailer David Deon that many in the states would rule that Wolve\u2019s kits are indeed old gold,\u201d Alex Alfonso says. \u201cIn fact, my university loved the color so much they named an entire alumni weekend after it (because that\u2019s what you do in middle-of-nowhere Indiana).\u201d 18 min: Now Wolves have a saunter down the right. The excellent Doherty pings in a cross and this time Jimenez has room to get a shot away, only to slash over the bar. He should have scored. 17 min: Wolves, dangerous down the left, attack down that flank again, Jonny breaking free and pulling a cutback towards Jimenez. The striker seems poised to stroke home, only for Atsu to steam in and make the tackle. Wolves scream for a penalty as Jimenez goes to ground, but a replay shows Atsu got the ball. 16 min: This is exactly like a game of chess. 13 min: Lejeune makes a poor error, gifting the ball straight to Wolves on the halfway line, but the centre-back\u2019s relieved to see Lascelles step in and stop Jimenez\u2019s charge towards goal. 11 min: Wolves have struggled to deal with defensive sides at home a few times this season and they will have to work hard to break down Newcastle. That said, the visitors are more ambitious than they were against Tottenham last week. 9 min: Ritchie has a saunter down the left and sends an absolutely hopeless cross into the Wolves area. 7 min: Jota collects a long ball into the Newcastle area, turns Yedlin and tries to cross. The ball floats over for a goal-kick. 4 min: Wolves have a look down the left, Jota combining with Jonny, who tries to sweep a clever pass to the far post for Jimenez, who can\u2019t quite make up the ground. Up the other end, Rondon has a go from the edge of the area. Straight at Rui Patricio. 3 min: \u201cAllow me to get something off my chest,\u201d says David Dein. \u201cWhy do you insist on perpetuating the myth that Wolves play in old gold? You ask anyone that isn\u2019t native to the UK what colour that shirt is and they will tell you it\u2019s orange. I can understand when textiles weren\u2019t capable of producing the colour gold cost effectively that but that was a time that is quite literally decades ago.\u201d Just because, to be honest. Peep! Newcastle, kicking from right to left in the first half, get the game underway. Mike Ashley is at Molineux tonight. Here come the teams! Wolves are in gold and black, Newcastle are in blue. An email! \u201cSupporting a failing team, like having a pet as a kid, is a necessary way of getting used to the fact of death,\u201d Ian Copestake says. \u201cMan City fans no longer have such an incessant exposure so let\u2019s top our hats to Newcastle\u2019s rabbit owning supporters.\u201d Wolves: Rui Patricio; Bennett, Coady, Boly; Doherty, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Neves, Jonny; Jota, Jimenez. Subs: Ruddy, Cavaleiro, Costa, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Vinagre, Traore. Newcastle: Dubravka; Yedlin, Lejeune, Schar, Lascelles, Ritchie; Hayden, Longstaff, Atsu, Perez; Rondon. Subs: Woodman, Fernandez, Manquillo, Diame, Almiron, Kenedy, Joselu. Referee: Graham Scott. Hello. With Rafael Benitez still defying very logical calls from Richard Keys to pump some of his own money into Newcastle United, special praise must be afforded to Mike Ashley for signing Miguel Almiron for \u00a321m. Times are hard, but Ashley\u2019s generosity knows no bounds. A mere 12 years since he pitched up in the north east, the owner has reached into his wallet to shatter the club\u2019s transfer record, further cementing his status as a club legend. Hurrah for Big Mike ... ... said absolutely nobody in a black and white shirt. For while Almiron does look like a good signing, it\u2019s difficult to be that effusive about Ashley when Newcastle find themselves out of the bottom three on goal difference, weighed down by yet another relegation battle and at risk of losing Benitez at the end of the season. Newcastle\u2019s manager may well need to see a bit more ambition before he decides to extend his contract and stay at a club whose vast potential continues to be quashed by a joyless ownership. Benitez has done a brilliant job so far - the man beat Manchester City the other day! - and it\u2019s clear that he could bring back the glory years if he receives proper backing, but at the moment it\u2019s hard not to feel that this is all going to end in tears. In the short term, at least Newcastle can feel reasonably confident about staying up with Benitez in charge. Yet their fans must look at what Wolves are doing this season and wonder what would be possible if the suits were to show some more ambition. Wolves, managed by the very impressive Nuno Espirito Santo, are well on their way to establishing themselves as the best of the rest in their first season back in the top flight and have delighted their supporters with some magnificent football this season. They are looking good in seventh place after consecutive wins over Leicester, West Ham and Everton, have picked up results against every member of the Big Six, have reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and will fancy their chances of making it five wins on the bounce in all competitions this season. Molineux is bound to be rocking and Newcastle are likely to need some of that organisational magic from Benitez to get something here. A creative spark from Almiron also wouldn\u2019t go amiss.
