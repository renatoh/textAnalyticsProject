John Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, popularly known as Fanny Hill (a play on mons veneris \u2013 the mount of Venus) was published in 1748. He began it as a young man working in the East India Company in Bombay in response to a challenge to write what became the first English pornographic novel without using coarse language. He completed it in his 30s, in debtor\u2019s prison, writing to pay for his freedom. He returned to jail soon after, convicted on obscenity charges. Fanny Hill became an underground hit for more than 200 years. Unlike previous continental pornography written in Latin or Greek, accessible only to the educated, the book was written in English at its most flowery and, frequently, comical best. Or, according to the moralists and critics, at its worst. They were not amused, for instance, by Fanny\u2019s enthusiasm when confronted by \u201ca maypole\u201d and an \u201cengine of love assaults\u201d, or her evident enjoyment of both: \u201cWhat floods of bliss! What melting transports!\u201d The alleged dropping of Fanny Hill from a university course, taught at Royal Holloway, University of London, appeared to hint at yet another example of the \u201csnowflake\u201d generation of students in action. They shy away from what displeases them; dictate content of courses; no-platform speakers (Germaine Greer and Peter Tatchell on grounds of transphobia) and establish \u201csafe spaces\u201d on campus so that unsettling debates that might \u201ctrigger\u201d concern can be avoided. It results in what Judith Shapiro, the former president of New York City\u2019s Barnard College, calls \u201cself-infantilism\u201d, ill-equipping students to see the world as others see it. So has Fanny Hill been \u201csnowflaked\u201d? Professor Judith Hawley teaches the course but, as she explained in a Guardian article, Fanny Hill hadn\u2019t been dropped because it had never been included. What she had said as a participant in a fascinating Radio 4 investigation into the history of freedom of speech, broadcast during the previous week, had been misrepresented. What she said is this: \u201cIn the 1980s I protested against the opening of a sex shop in Cambridge and taught Fanny Hill. Nowadays, I am afraid of causing offence to my students, in that I can understand why a senior academic imposing a pornographic text on students would come across as objectionable but also that the students would slap me with a trigger warning, in a way that I now self-censor \u2026\u201d \u201cTrigger warnings\u201d flag up references that might disturb. In the 1980s the issues raised by Fanny Hill, including desire, pornography and power, were important to discuss. Now, she explained, \u201cthe student body is larger, more diverse, less privileged and more uncertain about the future, and the ubiquity of pornography has changed the terms of the debate\u201d. Her words reveal the tricky area we have rightly entered, in which the long-held power of establishments which are affluent, academic, political, white and male are under challenge. The market too has played a role. Students are now not only learners but customers, paying up to \u00a39,000 a year and, therefore, expecting to define what value for money means to them, the consumer. The ability to identify \u201ctriggers\u201d, signalling material that might \u201cdamage\u201d, may be a customer perk but it infects education with caution and \u201cself-censorship\u201d that undermines its very purpose. Students, ironically, as a result, are being short-changed. In the 1980s, when Hawley was campaigning to stop the opening of a sex shop, sexism was rife, reflected in language that today is policed by a consensus on what is acceptable, backed by legislation. Political correctness helped to put the foot on the brakes \u2013 but how far down should the foot go? In a poll by the National Union of Students last year, over 60% were in favour of no-platforming. But silencing voices has a price. How does society decide when the cost becomes unacceptable? In the US, the right to freedom of speech is enshrined in the first amendment. As long ago as the 1990s, the law professor and anti-pornography campaigner Catharine MacKinnon warned, in Only Words, \u201cThe law of equality and the law of freedom of speech are on a collision course ...\u201d Or, as she put it more succinctly, \u201csome people get a lot more speech than others\u201d. How to decide who gets to talk about what \u2013 and where and why \u2013 is part of any dynamic democracy. But a guiding instinct should surely be that we learn from open and unafraid debate? A couple of years ago, students at New York\u2019s Columbia University supplied a flyer against homophobia for student rooms . It read: \u201cI want this space to be a safer space.\u201d One student. Adam Shapiro, objected. He told the New York Times \u201c If the point of a safe space is therapy for people who feel victimised by traumatisation, that sounds like a great mission\u201d. But he explained that both professors and students are increasingly loath to say anything that might hurt feelings: \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can have a therapeutic space that\u2019s also an intellectual space.\u201d The question is one of balance. So, back to Fanny Hill and Hawley\u2019s implied argument that, 30 years on, to teach it need no longer be a requirement. Fanny is a woman who admires other women. She has a sexual appetite that includes lesbianism (but, of course, as the book is a fantasy written by a man, the encounter is nothing in comparison to a \u201cstore bag of nature\u2019s pure sweets\u201d). At the end of the book, Fanny is neither \u201cfallen\u201d and destroyed, nor an outcast, but is married to the man who deflowered her, whom she loves and who is very rich. Fanny has it all. She is thus, in some ways, a female pioneer. Arguably, far from being an oppressive text which might make students feel coerced, as Hawley asserts, it is surprisingly subversive of patriarchal politics. \u201cSmutty\u201d books have often become milestones in society. In 1960, for instance, the Obscene Publications Act saw Penguin Books in the dock. Mervyn Griffiths QC famously asked the jury about Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover, \u201cIs it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?\u201d The answer was yes, and two million copies were sold in a year. They were bought, like Fanny Hill, by hoi polloi. The acquittal marked an important step for freedom of the written word and the end of what George Orwell called \u201cthe striped-trousered ones who rule\u201d. Other notable books \u2013 Radclyffe Hall\u2019s The Well of Loneliness, Erica Jong\u2019s Fear of Flying, Henry Miller\u2019s Tropic of Cancer, Nabokov\u2019s Lolita \u2013 might also run the risk of censorship by one group or another in today\u2019s delicate academic ecosystem. What\u2019s unclear is who gets to have the louder voice and why. Out of university, in the real world, \u201ctriggers\u201d aren\u2019t available, nor is it possible to duck issues that \u201churt\u201d. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, students were taught too often from curriculums that covered only half the story, omitting women, ethnic minorities and the working class. The clamour for change grew. But Orwell\u2019s \u201cintellectual cowardice\u201d is an ongoing issue as we struggle to forge a different, more just balance of power and a new model of freedom of expression. Of course it isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s worth the doing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
