My life is so different now", "bodyText": "After the birth, the rebirth. Jessica Ennis-Hill has not competitively hurled, hopped or hurdled for nearly two years because of injuries, pregnancy and the arrival of her son, Reggie. As she prepares for her comeback the Olympic heptathlon champion says that while motherhood has changed her, delighted her \u2013 and, yes, exhausted her \u2013 it has not softened her competitive edge. Her ambition is to make the podium at next year\u2019s Rio Olympics. \u201cBefore I had Reggie, it was all about me, me, me,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cNow Reggie comes before everything else but I am still really competitive. I want to be there, and be at my best again.\u201d However, she is under no illusions about the struggle that awaits. \u201cThis is my hardest challenge ever,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt was really tough in the lead-up to London but this is just a whole different ball game with the sleep deprivation, and all the things that come with being a mum. I am not going to lie and say it is easy. My life is so different now, in so many ways. I still get frustrated but then I go home, and I\u2019ve got Reggie.\u201d In the run-up to London 2012, Ennis-Hill trained twice a day at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. Now she does only one morning session \u2013 because she wants to spend the rest of the day with her son \u2013 but once he has gone down for the night, she pumps iron in the gym she has built at her house, striving for the chiselled physique that destroyed her rivals in 2012. She has barely competed since but while her comeback only started in November, and there have been a couple of minor achilles injuries on the uneven path back, she feels as if she is returning to her best. She certainly looks fit, focused and far more relaxed than when stuck in the epicentre of the media tsunami before London 2012. However, what she is attempting, by retaining an Olympic title after having a baby, is a barrier higher than other in her career. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said there hadn\u2019t been days when I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not sure I want to do this, because it is really hard,\u2019\u201d she admits. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019ve already become Olympic champion. Do I want all the stress and hard work again?\u2019 But I have to give it a go. I don\u2019t want to look back and think: \u2018Oh, maybe I could have done it.\u2019 At least if I do it, and I\u2019m successful, fantastic. If I\u2019m not quite where I want to be, then I will have given it my best shot.\u201d Reggie, who has just turned nine months, is apparently smiley and delightful. Every time Ennis-Hill mentions his name her face radiates. Thankfully, now he is sleeping through the night Ennis-Hill and her husband, Andy, can relax with box-sets again, particularly Game of Thrones. While she has been away, her heptathlon crown has passed on to Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the 22-year-old from Liverpool who had the world leading score in 2014 and won pentathlon gold at the European Indoor Championships. Ennis-Hill knows it will take time to snatch it back, which is why she is cautious about her comeback. Her plan for 2015 is to ease herself back into the competitive groove, qualify for this year\u2019s world championships and next year\u2019s Olympics, and then after a strong winter go for broke in 2016. \u201cI watched Kat and have seen how amazingly she has been doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed. She\u2019s a nice girl and I hope she says the same about me. She is obviously in great shape, she is young and at the time of her career when you step out on a track and PB all the time. \u201cI have got to deal with that and tell myself that I am having a different journey back. It is not going to return straight away. And people are going to compare me to London, when I was in the shape of my life. It\u2019s going to be different. I have just got to keep focused on what I want to achieve, which is qualifying for Rio and being ready for Rio.\u201d Ennis-Hill admits she cannot see herself going on much beyond then, although she will not rule out competing in the 2017 world championships in London (\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing much after London. I\u2019ll be 32 then, really old\u201d) or solely focusing on the 100m hurdles in the future. Her career, which may have only another 16 months to run, begins again at the Manchester CityGames in three weeks\u2019 time, before she tackles her first heptathlon since London 2012, in G\u00f6tzis at the end of May, against the world\u2019s elite including Johnson-Thompson and the 17-year-old prodigy Morgan Lake. \u201cI am really nervous,\u201d Ennis-Hill says. \u201cBecause it has been such a long time and things have changed so much, I don\u2019t really know what to expect, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a million miles away.\u201d Jessica Ennis trains in the new adidas Climachill range of active cooling sportswear and Ultra Boost footwear.
