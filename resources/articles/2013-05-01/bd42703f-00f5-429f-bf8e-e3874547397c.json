Now that we have it on disc, however, it's readily apparent that the work itself is seriously flawed. It's a meditation, for soprano, chorus and orchestra, on the life of Simone Weil, the leftwing, French-Jewish philosopher and theologian, who went on a fatal hunger strike in London in 1943 in protest at the Nazis' treatment of her compatriots in occupied France. There are some fine orchestral effects, but all in all, this is an undramatic work that presents an unaccountably bland portrait of a rebellious, if self-lacerating intellectual, much admired by Camus and Trotsky, among others. Conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, the recording was made in tandem with a revival in Helsinki last year. Dawn Upshaw sounds tired in her big solos. The playing is formidable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
