Spurr, who worked on the government\u2019s review of the school curriculum, was suspended from the university on Friday after the website New Matilda revealed emails sent by him to colleagues over the two years referred to the prime minister as an \u201cAbo lover\u201d and talked about \u201cMussies\u201d and \u201cchinky poos\u201d taking over Australia. In new emails released by the website Spurr attacks Goodes for winning Australian of the Year. He lists Goodes\u2019s qualities as \u201cAborigine, Sportsmen, mother was a member of the \u2018stolen generation\u2019.\u201d \u201cTicking all the correct boxes, now all we need to know is that he suffers from \u2018depression\u2019 and has a disability and he becomes the complete role model for Australians today. In his acceptance speech all he talked about was racism and every time he said \u2018Australia\u2019 he mispronounced it,\u201d Spurr wrote to a colleague and a friend in January this year. \u201cAbbott wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year \u2013 his version of Rudd\u2019s apology and perpetuating the black armband \u2013 to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all.\u201d Labor has used the emails to attack the government\u2019s curriculum review saying it is \u201ctainted\u201d. Spurr recommended a greater emphasis on western literature in the review, saying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture had a \u201cminimal\u201d impact on Australian literature. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, has dismissed the attacks, saying Spurr was independently selected to be a \u201cspecial consultant\u201d on the English curriculum. Spurr was hired by Sydney University as chair in poetry in 2010. In separate transcripts, released by New Matilda after accusations the emails were \u201ctaken out of context\u201d, Spurr complains about an Aboriginal family living in his neighbourhood in a \u201cdear little terrace\u201d. He writes that the terrace has been \u201cutterly destroyed\u201d with empty beer bottles strewn outside with other garbage. \u201cThese are the people whose \u2018ancient wisdom\u2019, our V-C says, we should respect, and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before, confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them,\u201d he wrote. \u201c... I wonder how he\u2019d like these manifestations of ancient wisdom living next door. The immediate neighbours tell me it has been hell on earth and, of course, their property values have plummeted. \u201cThey\u2019re living next door to a rubbish tip: human and material.\u201d In a separate exchange a friend emailed Spurr to complain about a story about a \u201charlot\u201d who fell asleep in a bed at a party and woke to find a colleague putting his penis in her mouth. Spurr\u2019s friend referred to her as a \u201cworthless slut\u201d who was going to cause the \u201cpoor chap\u201d years of imprisonment because she made a complaint to police. \u201cReeling from that [redacted] story. Ye gods. I think she needs a lot put in her mouth, permanently, and then stitched up,\u201d Spurr responded, before going on to write mockingly about a transgender person he had been told about. Spurr defended the emails last week as a \u201cwhimsical\u201d game which was mocking the extreme language used. He was suspended by on Friday by the university, which \u201cprecluded [him] from attending any university campus while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the university\u2019s enterprise agreement\u201d. \u201cRacist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney,\u201d the university said in a statement. In one of the emails published by New Matilda, written on 19 April, Spurr reveals that Pyne wanted him to compare Australian school curriculums with those from other countries. \u201cThe Californian high school English curriculum has arrived (as Pyne wants me to compare ours with other countries). Another 300 pages of reading! \u201cAnd whereas the local curriculum has the phrase \u2018Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\u2019 on virtually every one of its 300 pages, the Californian curriculum does not ONCE mention native Americans and has only a very slight representation of African-American literature (which, unlike Abo literature, actually exists and has some distinguished productions).\u201d The heads of the curriculum review, Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire, did not comment on the emails when contacted by Guardian Australia on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
