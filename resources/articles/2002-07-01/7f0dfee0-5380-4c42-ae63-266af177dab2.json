Workers could be forced by their employer to renegotiate pension arrangements to make their scheme cheaper to run, with the effect that retirement income is cut and benefits, such as a cash lump sum to a surviving spouse, are scrapped. The plans, published yesterday, are part of a review commissioned by the government in response to a wave of employers switching to cheap personal pension style schemes or closing existing schemes altogether. More than half of Britain's biggest 100 companies, including Marks &amp; Spencer, BT and Lloyds TSB, have closed their guaranteed final salary schemes and told new employees they must join pension plans that depend on a rising stock market, which yesterday stood at a five-year low. The report's author, Alan Pickering, former chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, said he wanted to protect final salary schemes and encourage more people to join. He argued that the government should step back from \"micro management\" of pension funds, which meant they were inflexible and swathed in red tape. He proposed a pensions act that would sweep away the current complex rules and create a single set of principles governing all pensions. He also wanted to create a \"more proactive\" regulator, and allow employers to make pension scheme membership a condition of employment. Flexibility, he said, would also mean that employers could allow people to work beyond 65. He hoped legislation would take effect in two years. Current rules insist pensioner income is inflation-proofed and death benefits are payable to spouses. Mr Pickering described these benefits as \"bells and whistles\" and said they should be paid for by employees. The work and pensions minister, Andrew Smith, hailed Mr Pickering's proposals in the Commons as \"radical, ambitious and pragmatic\". He said: \"I believe pensions simplification has to be at the heart of any strategy to encourage greater pension provision.\" But he said survivors' benefits were \"valued features\", saying the bells and whistles tag was \"certainly not one I would use\". Mr Smith pointed to a further review by the inland revenue, expected in the autumn, that will overhaul tax rules governing pensions. He said there would be a green paper in the autumn which would look at occupational and personal pension policy \"to make far-reaching changes to enable more people to build up savings for their retirement.\" John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, said: \"We could be looking at the biggest pension rip-off in history. This report consigns hard-working people to an old age of increasing poverty. \"The government has turned to an industry insider who is trying to make it as easy as possible for employers to renege on any pensions responsibility.\" The Liberal Democrat spokesman, Steve Webb, said: \"The poorest pensioners in the land are very often widows, very often elderly. Can it be right to undermine provision for widows? Can it be right to have more pensions frozen for 20 years of retirement?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
