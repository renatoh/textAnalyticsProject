It will console \u00c1lvaro Morata to know the Chelsea manager thought he embodied them all. Morata misses were the only blot on an otherwise encouraging night for Conte\u2019s team at Burnley as they preserved faint hopes of Champions League qualification. Chelsea\u2019s \u00a358m record signing cut a furious figure when substituted shortly after squandering a glorious opportunity to seal the 65th win of Conte\u2019s 100-game reign. The Spain international exchanged words with a mocking Burnley crowd behind the dug-out and threw away his boots in disgust before receiving a consoling pat from Cesc F\u00e0bregas. Victor Moses\u2019 70th minute winner ensured Morata\u2019s miss did not matter and, while it may hinder his chances of starting Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton, the striker\u2019s overall contribution alongside Olivier Giroud was ample consolation to Conte. \u201cI think \u00c1lvaro must be angry because when you have a chance to score, especially for a striker, it can change your confidence,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cI think he was angry with himself for the chance he missed but I saw a very good performance. I am happy I tried two strikers. They played very well. To see Giroud and Morata play this way \u201cthere was a good combination and a desire to press. This could be an option for Sunday and maybe the future. It can be a good option when players show you this desire and sacrifice themselves without the ball for the team.\u201d The FA Cup may have assumed greater importance than Conte dared imagine back in August but he and his players are not giving up on a top-four finish lightly. They are five points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham with four matches to play but their superiority over a Burnley side that had not lost at Turf Moor since 20 January, and had the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal in sixth following five consecutive league wins, should restore belief beyond Wembley. Conte made six changes to the side that defeated Southampton in the league last weekend. He changed Chelsea\u2019s formation too, opting for Giroud and Morata at the head of a 3-5-2 with Pedro in central midfield, but there was no evidence of disruption as the visitors gave a commanding display. Conte said: \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy because it is five points to Tottenham but the only thing we can do is try to get three points in every game from now until the end.\u201d Giroud and Morata established an immediate rapport, combining instinctively and giving the Burnley defence no respite in possession all night. The former Arsenal striker released his partner with a neat flick over James Tarkowski. Morata\u2019s run took him wide but his low shot was goal-bound only to strike goalkeeper Nick Pope\u2019s legs and deflect wide. The England World Cup hopeful was not so fortunate from Chelsea\u2019s next attack. Moses was the instigator with a driving run that caught Stephen Ward unawares, although credit is due to Gary Cahill for the perfectly-timed delivery that dropped at the feet of the right wing-back. Moses pulled his cross back from the byline towards Giroud. Pope\u2019s fingertips got there first, but only succeeded in steering the ball against the arm and thigh of Long before it dropped slowly, agonisingly, over the line. Burnley responded strongly with Ashley Barnes a constant menace but it was Chelsea who came closest to extending their lead before the interval. Giroud sent Morata through on goal for a second time only for Pope to deny the former Real Madrid and Juventus striker his 15th goal of the season. Conte had no complaints with Morata\u2019s work rate or the pace that frequently stretched Burnley. His finishing was a different matter, however, and there was no clearer illustration of his lack of composure when sent clear for a third time. Kant\u00e9 was the provider, intercepting Matthew Lowton\u2019s attempted pass and releasing Morata from inside the Chelsea half. The striker galloped through and his options appeared to improve when Pope stayed on his six-yard line. Morata lined up his shot but, to widespread disbelief among the away fans, failed to hit the target. It would be his last contribution before being replaced by Eden Hazard, who brought a calm assurance to the closing stages. Morata\u2019s miss assumed greater significance when Burnley levelled courtesy of a wild deflection off Barnes\u2019 heel. Johann Berg Gudmundsson tried his luck from distance and it paid dividends when his shot struck his team-mate and sailed into the far corner with Courtois stranded. Chelsea players converged on the referee to protest that Barnes was offside. He was level with Cahill when the ball was struck and Burnley were back in the game. But not for long. Emerson produced an impressive display on the left for Chelsea and it was his searching cross that produced the winner for Moses. Giroud was unable to connect with another of his scorpion kicks and the delivery dropped invitingly for the unmarked wing-back at the back post. Moses drilled a low shot past Pope for a deserved, hard-fought away win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
