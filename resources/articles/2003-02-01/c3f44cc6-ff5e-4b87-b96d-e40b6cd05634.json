The changes Capital has been making to its stations, shows and programming will begin to improve listener figures in the first half of this year, according to JP Morgan analyst Simon Mays-Smith. And he says the group is well-placed to ride out the depressed advertising market facing yet more jitters with the threat of war in Iraq. Shares in Capital rose 4% today to 450p on the positive note, even though Capital chief executive David Mansfield said last month he did not expect any miracles this year and that advertising for February and March remained uncertain. Mr Mays-Smith says Chris Tarrant staying on at the 95.8 Capital Radio breakfast show, increasing listening figures for Xfm, new shows at Birmingham station BRMB and improvements at Capital-owned stations in Liverpool and Scotland should all contribute to a growth in listeners. He also says that the threat of war may benefit radio companies, as radio ads can be produced very quickly at a small cost. \"A TV campaign takes time to get to air and advertisers might be holding back right now, whereas a radio campaign can be made one day and on the air the next,\" said Mr Mays-Smith. He said fears that some TV ads would be pulled if a full-scale conflict began in Iraq might make advertisers reluctant to start on new campaigns. Last March Capital shares were sailing at a high of 869p. However, by November Capital reported pre-tax profits, including goodwill and exceptional items, for the year to September had halved from \u00a327.8m \u00a314.6m. By January, Capital's share price hit an eight-year low on fears its advertising sales would plummet alongside those of TV broadcasters Carlton Communications and Granada. But in reporting a 6% annual drop in revenue for the last quarter of 2002, Capital sparked a rally in its share price as the City breathed a sigh of relief that the figures were not as bad as they had thought they might be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
