We fear for our futures, not our holidays", "bodyText": "The current political crisis over Brexit has been a wake-up call for my generation: the doctrine that our parents and grandparents will leave behind a better world no longer holds. But, of course, not every young person feels this way. A significant minority \u2013 especially those in towns outside London and the south-east \u2013 do not necessarily share the enthusiasm of the 78% of young people who would back remain in a people\u2019s vote on Brexit. And those that do will often have different reasons for their convictions too. We don\u2019t want to leave them behind. This summer the campaign I\u2019m part of, Our Future Our Choice, will join a tour of the whole country, calling on politicians to let us be heard. We will be gathering in Wolverhampton, Sunderland, Leeds, Glasgow, Derby, Belfast and many more towns and cities over the summer, leading up to one more huge rally in London on 12 October. From our visits to schools, youth centres and universities across the UK over the past year, it\u2019s already clear to us that young people\u2019s anti-Brexit sentiment is more complicated than the typical image you might see on marches, with demonstrators draped in the blue and gold of the EU flag. Instead, the strongest voices demanding a people\u2019s vote come from those who have been politicised out of necessity: those who see our horizons retreating and our prospects receding, and who have watched the last three years with unease that has turned to disgust and anger. Rebecca Coleman, 21, is a young activist from Brentwood, Essex, where 59% of voters opted to leave in 2016. Until recently, her parents had stopped talking about Brexit. But, she says, \u201cI\u2019m so involved in it now that we can\u2019t help but talk about it.\u201d Has it changed minds? \u201cI think my mum voted to leave and that she feels there was a lot of misinformation. Talking about it has made us both much more confident about what should happen next.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s example shows how, through their families, young people \u2013 especially in leave areas \u2013 can still have a significant impact on changing attitudes towards Brexit. Tara Connolly, 21, from west Belfast co-founded Our Future Our Choice Northern Ireland to bring young people from all communities together. \u201cThis idea that young anti-Brexit campaigners are \u2018the elite\u2019 or \u2018idealistic\u2019 is so frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cOur entire campaign \u2026 is about the hard facts of a border in the event of a no deal.\u201d She hates the stereotype that all young people care about is their ability to travel across Europe hassle-free. The rallies we\u2019ll be holding in every corner of Britain this summer will seek to redefine this image, carving out a more accurate picture of the scope of anger and activism in a campaign that has come so far in representing so many. Meanwhile, the one in 400 UK citizens who are members of the Conservative party prepare to pick a prime minister for the rest of us. This small, wholly unrepresentative segment of society are deciding the future direction of this country at a time of total political paralysis. They are granted their proxy referendum on Brexit, yet the nation at large is denied a right to the same. This summer of youth action will be a welcome break from the Tory psychodrama. It will be a source of hope for those feeling hopeless \u2013 and for all those who believe in the democratic right of the British public to resolve this crisis ourselves. \u2022 Lara Spirit is co-president of Our Future Our Choice \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 as the caption in an earlier version stated that the picture was of a \u201cpro-Brexit\u201d march"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
