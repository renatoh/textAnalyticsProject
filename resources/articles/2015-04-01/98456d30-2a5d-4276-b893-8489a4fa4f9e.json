Florida senator Marco Rubio declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination, delivering an emotional speech in Miami that took up themes of generational change and how families struggle for the sake of their children. \u201cThis election is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cJust yesterday a leader from yesterday began a campaign from president by promising to take us back to yesterday. Yesterday is over. And we\u2019re never going back.\u201d Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton hit the road on her way to Iowa to win voters for the Democratic nomination, as the only declared candidate for her party so far. The understated first day of her campaign was billed by staffers as a new, \u201chumble\u201d approach by Clinton to connect with voters \u2013 although Clinton did not interact with any at a Chipotle pit stop along the way. Republican senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz continued to hammer Clinton and collect funds, as the two other declared candidates for president. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and current Wisconsin governor Scott Walker are expected to announce campaigns in the coming weeks. You can read Richard Luscombe\u2019s full report from on the scene in Miami here. Rubio faces a steep climb to overtake Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, who have both set in motion fundraising machines over the past months without formally declaring their candidacies. The senator will especially have to compete with Bush, who as Florida governor helped raise Rubio up while he was a young politician, for votes and money in the peninsular state. The Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker has at least one endorsement for Rubio. The New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt: And the cautious verdict of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten: Rubio\u2019s website is apparently overwhelmed with traffic. Critical reviews are in and they\u2019re largely positive \u2013 an emotional speech to a receptive audience, touching on perhaps Rubio\u2019s strongest assets. Rubio used some of Obama\u2019s favorite rhetorical devices \u2013 talk of generational change, optimistic, constructive plans for the future, the inspiration of his family \u2013 and turned them to his own devices. He also played those themes of family, generational change and the future, distinctly against Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, whose public identities are so firmly rooted in their famous families and the past. New York Times political reporter Michael Barbaro: The Hill\u2019s Jessica Taylor: MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt: The Daily Caller\u2019s Matt Lewis: And finally he loops back round to his pitch for the \u201cnew American century,\u201d and delivers the mandatory thanks and benediction over America. His wife walks up on stage, and the crowd whistles and cheers while reporters lift up their phones to take pictures. A theme emerges, if you\u2019ll pardon the understatement. He lists a string of classic middle-class examples, the single mother, the struggling family, the students scrabbling to make it in the world, and says that he will work to ensure \u201cthe American miracle lives on\u201d. \u201cThis will be the message of my campaign, and the purpose of my presidency.\u201d The next 19 months will take me far away from home,\u201d he says, listing his children by name and the sports they play, saying he\u2019ll miss them. \u201cTheirs is the most important generation of America, \u2026 if we can capture the promise of this new century, they will be the freest,\u201d he says. But if Americans fail, \u201cthey will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one they left their parents.\u201d \u201cIn this country you will achieve all the things we never could,\u201d he says, quoting his father in Spanish \u2013 in both langugaes. He continues talking about his father \u2013 an interesting contrast to Barack Obama\u2019s similar use of his own mother\u2019s difficult past and his father\u2019s influential role in his life. \u201cHe wanted all the doors that closed for him to open for me. And so my father stood behind the back of that small portable bar for all those years so that I could stand in front of you tonight. \u201cThat journey from behind that bar to this podium, that\u2019s the essence of the American dream.\u201d His voice seeming to falter with emotion, Rubio is now talking about how the son of a bartender and immigrants could hope to win the presidency. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn, but I cannot, because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m humbled [to remember] that America doesn\u2019t owe me anything. I have a debt to America that I must try to repay. This isn\u2019t just the country where I was born, America is literally the place that changed my family\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cWe must change the decisions that they\u2019re making by changing the people who are making them,\u201d he goes on. \u201cAnd so, that is why tonight, grounded by the lessons of our history \u2026 I announce my candidacy for the presidency of the United States.\u201d Rubio is ranging wide on foreign policy issues, first going for Iran and Israel, offering steadfast support to the latter and an even harder line on the former. \u201cWe must no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression,\u201d he continues, and throws out an aside about cracking down on the human rights abuses of countries, \u201cespecially Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua.\u201d \u201cThis election is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.\u201d \u201cNow just yesterday, a leader from yesterday\u201d \u2013 the audience boos \u2013 \u201cbegan a campaign from president by promising to take us back to yesterday.\u201d \u201cYesterday is over,\u201d Rubio says, waxing philosophical. \u201cAnd we\u2019re never going back.\u201d He says the US should reform its tax code, reform immigration, and repeal Obamacare. \u201cIf we do these things the American people will create millions of [better] jobs.\u201d His voice stutters a moment, and he seems understandably nervous. He goes on to describe a \u201cnew economy\u201d in which more people get jobs right out of high school, and in which \u201cthe family, not the government, is the most important institution in this society.\u201d Cue the pro-life, anti-abortion comment. And then the pro-whatever-education-your-family-sees-fit pitch, an increasingly popular social theme for Republican candidates. He\u2019s harping on education now, saying it\u2019s too expensive to most and prohibits social mobility \u2013 an oddly Democratic theme. When America doesn\u2019t lead, \u201cglobal chaos inevitably follows,\u201d Rubio continues \u201cThey appease our enemies, they betray our allies, and they weaken our military.\u201d And at last he hits upon the theme of youth, saying \u201cit\u2019s time for our generation\u201d to lead the US into \u201ca new American century.\u201d He says his parents achieved \u201cwhat became to be known as the American dream\u201d and is now hitting the campaign segment, talking about young peopel who have thousands of dollars in student loans and don\u2019t have jobs, small businesses straining under \u201cmore taxes, and more government.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because while our people and our economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders are stuck in the 20th century.\u201d Big applause. They\u2019re looking backwards (our leaders), he says. \u201cRegulating like it was 1999,\u201d to somewhat confused laughter. He\u2019s now doing the requisite family background. \u201cWhen they were young my parents had big dreams to themselves, \u2026 but because they were not born into wealth and power their future was destined to be defined by their past.\u201d He says that America was the place where they could achieve their dreams. \u201cThey never made it big, but they were successful.\u201d Rubio has arrived, to chants of \u201cMarco\u201d from the audience. He says the Freedom Tower is truly a symbol of US \u201cfreedom and opportunity\u201d and that that\u2019s why he\u2019s delivering the speech there. He starts by talking about the experience of \u201ctens of thousands of Cubans\u201d and \u201cslaves and exiles\u201d who arrived there. The Washington Post\u2019s Ed O\u2019Keefe adds one more rap/pop star to Rubio\u2019s apparent list of jams (which at least includes Jay Z, Eminem and Wiz Khalifa). And at last, down in Miami, the introductory remarks are underway for senator Marco Rubio. A religious leader (just missed his own introduction) has asked for a benediction from God: \u201cWe pray that you will raise up the right man at the right hour.\u201d Now everyone\u2019s milling about, waiting for Rubio. You can watch a live stream of the speech here: Back in Washington, Biden cracks, \u201cToday I am announcing that Rubio and I are going to run together.\u201d Meanwhile, down in the strange world of Florida politics, awkward columns and famous football icons. It was so much simpler way back when \u2026 or at least it seems so now. My colleague Ben Jacobs (@bencjacobs) has just spoken with the man of the hour, the manager of the Maumee Chipotle. \u201cShe was grabbing lunch and ate for 45 minutes in the restaurant,\u201d manager Charles Wright told the Guardian, adding that few customers even noticed the former secretary of state was eating a chicken bowl with \u201ca friend of hers\u201d \u2013 apparently aide Huma Abedin. \u201cWe had a couple of customers taking pictures of her and didn\u2019t know anything until after the fact,\u201d he said. \u201cShe definitely got our famous guacamole.\u201d Barack Obama broke the unspoken barrier and gestured over the salad shield. Mitt Romney stood stiffly and bobbled, as alive and natural as he feels everywhere. Clinton, though, was like a phantom, gone before anyone could notice. They\u2019ve found her. She thought she could win over the American people from a van, quietly emailing donors and meeting vetted citizens in tightly controlled interactions carefully arranged to feel natural. But that would never last. She appeared in a Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, and the New York Times called. A chicken burrito bowl, with guac, sure to affect millions of undecided voters in the Toledo area with strong opinions about not only this particular Chipotle that she would so brazenly choose to patronize, but also about the decision to order a burrito bowl, rather than risk dirtying her hands with that middle-class option: the collapsing, overstuffed Chiptole burrito. Immigration protesters have also arrived at the Miami campaign launch, MSNBC\u2019s Benjy Sarlin tweets. Predictable portents. Defectors from the Clinton camp have come out to the Rubio rally in Miami, Richard Luscombe reports for the Guardian. From his perch in the middle of a busy junction outside the Freedom Tower, campaigner Bob Kunst delivered his \u201canti-dynasty\u201d message to a backdrop of buses, trucks and honking car horns. Kunst, from Miami Beach, and a couple of like-minded protesters, set up their \u201cFight Terrorism, Support Israel\u201d banners, one accusing Hillary Clinton of \u201cselling out\u201d America and Israel in her time as Secretary of State. Kunst says he is traditionally a Democratic voter and was a former campaign worker for Clinton, but now despises what she stands for. Above all, he says, he is against any kind of dynasty. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Bushes, Clintons or whatever,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want them. If all America has to offer is a dynasty, it can\u2019t survive. As for Rubio, Kunst wants to hear what he has to say before making up his mind. \u201cI\u2019m not attached to any party, I\u2019m attached to someone who is going to do something, who is going to stop Iran getting nuclear weapons, who is going to stand up to the Islamic Nazis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s Marco Rubio, time will tell.\u201d So why did he fall out with Hillary? \u201cI helped launch her campaign last time around, was with her for 145 campaign appearances, and when it was done I didn\u2019t get so much as a thank you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days she\u2019s more worried what her hair looks like and how she\u2019s dressed.\u201d A blocky H with a red arrow pointing right, reminiscent of the logo of a shipping company that you might not trust to deliver your package on time. Why does the arrow point to the right? Does it designate the future? Why not a destination? A rightward tilt to the Democratic candidate? That your package is on its way? A name, in black and\u2026 let\u2019s say cerise, in lower-case letters with the continental United States as the dot on the I. \u201cA New American Century,\u201d all caps, below. What happened to Alaska and Hawaii? Are they not part of the US in the new American century? If it is cerise, is that really a color you want to see on a person who wants power over military drones? Ever since Barack Obama\u2019s team developed the O with an American flag path sweeping across the circle\u2019s central void, campaign logos stopped simply being campaign logos. Everyone\u2019s got a take. What\u2019s yours? Meanwhile, Bump\u2019s investigation continues. The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump has unearthed a photo of Rubio working for Bob Dole in the 1996 election against Bill Clinton. Bump also noticed that Rubio seems to have unusual aesthetic ideas about the possibilities of a lower-case I. In Miami, Richard Luscombe (@richlusc) is talking with people gathered round the Freedom Tower, where Rubio will announce at 6pm ET the start of his presidential campaign. Teenager Mauricio Antonio Pons was at the head of the queue to get into the Freedom Tower, arriving before almost everybody to collect his ticket and claim his place at the front of the arena. As chairman of the Miami-Dade Teenage Republicans group, Pons wanted to hear a message about youth from Rubio, whom he says can be \u201ca beacon\u201d for those just beginning to take an interest in politics. \u201cHe brings vitality and youth to the campaign, something that we haven\u2019t seen since JFK. He\u2019s someone who can speak for and represent the younger generation,\u201d said Pons. \u201cI want to hear him talk about what he\u2019s going to do for the younger generation, not just the Hispanic youth of this city, but all around the United States. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign is not just a gamble for national prominence and a chance at the White House, it\u2019s a gamble with Rubio\u2019s Florida Senate seat. Fickle Floridians have a Republican (Rubio) and Democrat apiece (Bill Nelson) in the Senate, and the state\u2019s diverse electorate \u2013 conservative in the north and along the panhandle, pockets of deeply liberal northerners and Hispanics in the densely populated south, senior citizens (the powerhouse of American elections) \u2013 votes more or less according to its whims. Although Republicans won a commanding victory in Congress in the 2014 midterms, with 54 members in the Senate, their majority is slim enough that they could ill-afford to lose the slippery Florida seat. Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo, in Miami, tweeted that he saw Lieutenant General Carlos Lopez Cantera lingering about the Freedom Tower \u2013 and wondered whether the Republican will run for Rubio\u2019s seat. Any Republican candidate faces a stark challenge in Florida, where the views of Hispanic populations are changing as more young people are able to vote, and in the context of President Obama\u2019s immigration orders and rapprochement with Cuba. While Miami was once a city of staunch anti-Castro sentiment, those high emotions have in part slipped into a pattern visible around the US in which Hispanic Americans from all around Latin America have much more mixed views about the country. People desperately want in to the event where Marco Rubio kick off his 2016 presidential campaign, the senator\u2019s press people tell Richard Luscombe (@richlusc), who\u2019s reporting for the Guardian from Miami. According to Rubio\u2019s press team, ticket applications for today\u2019s announcement were received from every state except Vermont. Spokesperson Brooke Sammon wasn\u2019t able to say what Vermont voters have got against her boss, but was pleased at what she says is the senator\u2019s wide-ranging appeal elsewhere. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to making the announcement and getting his message out there,\u201d she said, even though Rubio had already delivered the news of his candidacy in the conference call with donors earlier Monday. She said more than 3,500 supporters had requested tickets by the close of registration for a venue that holds only a thousand. To cater for the expected masses, the Rubio team set up a giant screen in an adjacent parking lot, with \u201cRubio for President signs\u201d and pin badges as a reward. By 3pm, an hour before doors opened, the line was snaking around the base of the Freedom Tower. As for the media, Rubio\u2019s event attracted 190 requests for credentials from 65 outlets. Also at the Tower is the Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker. Rubio thinks the United States is \u201cat a generational moment\u201d, he\u2019s told ABC News in an interviewWest Miami, not far from the Freedom Tower, where he will give a kickoff speech in a few hours. \u201cI think this country\u2019s at a generational moment where it needs to decide not what party it wants in charge but what kind of country are we going to want to be moving forward,\u201d Rubio told [George] Stephanopoulos in an interview at the Florida senator\u2019s home. \u201cI think the 21st century can be the American century, and I believe that I can lead this country in that direction. I can help lead it there from the Senate. I can lead it there as president.\u201d When asked if Rubio believed he is the most qualified candidate to be president, he said: \u201cI absolutely feel that way.\u201d Rubio\u2019s rhetoric not only suggests the historic potential of the first Hispanic president (not to mention the first Cuban-American), but also implies that Rubio, 43, is the fresh, young leader that the US needs \u2013 and not a fusty icon of an earlier age. Don\u2019t vote for those old people, is Rubio\u2019s translation from politico to English. The presumed frontrunners of both parties, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, are both in their 60s, family of former presidents, and familiar faces of the past 20-30 years. In case you thought presidential campaigns couldn\u2019t get more insular, weird and driven by an insatiable appetite for cash, you\u2019ll be relieved/depressed to know that Ted Cruz has upped the ante. Cruz is asking his allies to collect at least $500,000 each from their friends and colleagues in return for access to the senator, which the AP describes as \u201ccoveted\u201d in its report. The twist on this cash-for-access bargain is that Cruz has given special names to the various levels of fundraisers and donors within his organization, AP reports. There are statesmen ($250,000), generals ($100,000) and federalists ($50,000), according to a fundraising document obtained by the AP. With each escalating pledge to raise cash comes more perks, including access to the candidate and his inner circle of advisers. For instance, the top fundraisers are promised access to a donor retreat, dinner with the Cruz family and the title of national finance co-chairman. For the lowest bracket, donors can become members of the state-level finance committee and attend a Cruz-sponsored reception at the Republican National Committee\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland. Cruz is not the first political candidate to essentially tell supporters they can unlock special achievements and abilities by ponying up some cash. In 2000, George W Bush had \u201cpioneers\u201d for $100,000 and \u201crangers\u201d for $200,000. In 2008, Hillary Clinton called her $100,000 fundraisers \u201cHillraisers\u201d, which suggests she ought to spend at least a little of that money paying someone to come up with a better name. In 2012 Barack Obama apparently resisted the impulse to hand out nicknames. Cruz\u2019s efforts have not gone for nothing, the AP continues. He collected $4m in the first eight days of his campaign, and his Super Pacs are believed to have amassed $31m in about a week. Always a bastion of trivia, the New York Times has written up a sort of dating profile of senator Marco Rubio, noting he likes football, rap and used to hang out in gazebos to drink with his underage friends. He loves the Miami Dolphins and played high school football: \u201cHe watches every game (not always live), according to his aides, has an almost encyclopedic memory of Dolphins trivia, and has been known to diagram plays and study pre-NFL draft scouting reports\u201d He\u2019s West Coast: \u201cRubio \u2014 who has described himself as a West Coast rap fan in the 1990s \u2014 [has name-checked in speeches] the rapper Wiz Khalifa and \u2018that modern-day poet by the name of Jay Z.\u2019\u201d He is a former Mormon and loves the Osmonds: \u201cWhen his family moved to Las Vegas in 1979, Mr. Rubio, then 8, was baptized as a Mormon \u2026 Rubio and his family returned to the Roman Catholic Church several years later.\u201d He was all about gazebos: \u201cThe Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables \u2026 was one of his teenage haunts. \u2018Its gazebos,\u2019 he wrote in his memoir, \u2018offered the perfect hiding spot for underage beer drinking.\u2019\u201d In the Guardian\u2019s own extremely cursory investigation of Rubio, we learned that he has 40 LinkedIn connections, sometimes also attends Southern Baptist services, and excelled at intern tasks such as getting coffee and doing copies for Florida representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. He also tends to lick his lips a lot, a tic commemorated in this supercut of a recent NRA speech (ht @kaylaepstein). If you want a completely different account of Rubio, check out the latest of the Guardian\u2019s mock CVs of the presidential candidates. Still traversing the plains, fields and forests of America by van \u2013 but probably just on the highway somewhere \u2013 Hillary Clinton is running her campaign\u2019s day one mostly by email, reportedly. Reporters for the New York Times and Politico say the email keeps hammering the issue of inequality and a diminishing middle class \u2013 and that it\u2019s aimed at donors. There might have been a less loaded medium. Progressive Democrats to the left of Hillary Clinton are already pushing her to the left \u2013 or to at least say something \u2013 before they hand her an endorsement. The Guardian\u2019s DC bureau chief Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) reports from the capital. Within hours of the former secretary of state confirming her intention to run for president in 2016, several of the most prominent figures on the so-called progressive wing of the Democratic party were urging a clearer vision from her before offering their support. \u201cIt has to include progressive taxation,\u201d said New York mayor Bill de Blasio in an NBC interview shortly before the announcement. \u201cIt has to include increases in wages and benefits. It has to include the willingness to tax the wealthy so we can invest in infrastructure, so we can invest in education again.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important that [Clinton] come out with her vision as soon as possible,\u201d he added. Others were startled to find omitted from her website any detail about policy or positions, including Zephyr Teachout, a New York law professor and Democrat who ran for governor in 2014. \u201cI was not particularly impressed with it,\u201d said Zephyr Teachout, a New York Democrat who ran for governor in 2014, warning on Twitter it was \u201csurprisingly free of content, lacking autobiography, policy [and] vision.\u201d Teachout said she had not given up hope of more progressive candidates entering the race or Clinton taking a more populist approach on issues such as free trade and Wall Street reform, where the party leadership has tended to be more economically liberal in the past. \u201cThere is a hunger for open repudiation of the financial deregulation of the first Clinton era,\u201d she told The Guardian. But while progressives are trying to nudge Clinton to the left, it\u2019s not clear that they have any alternative candidate to endorse. Senator Elizabeth Warren, though ruling herself out as a 2016 candidate repeatedly, has also been more vocal in recent days, calling on Clinton to make clear where she stands on issues such as the minimum wage and equal pay legislation. You can read a longer take by Dan asking what Clinton stands for here. Activist group People for the American Way has already started airing a Spanish radio ad in Miami and Denver (the biggest cities of two major swing states) damning Rubio for his \u201cdangerous agenda\u201d. \u201cThe ad makes clear how Rubio is no different from the rest of the GOP; his far-right positions should disqualify him from the Presidential ticket,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cJust like the rest of the Republican Party, Rubio\u2019s wrong for working families: He supports getting rid of the minimum wage, cutting Medicare, and deporting Dreamers,\u201d board member Dolores Huerta said, using the nickname given to young people protected by Obama\u2019s immigration orders. Obama won Florida and Colorado in both of his presidential campaigns, but Floridians are notoriously fickle and the state\u2019s polling infrastructure famously problematic. George W Bush won both states in the 2000 and 2004 elections, although he had to be delivered Florida through a supreme court verdict (in which now senator Ted Cruz played a crucial role). Richard Luscombe is down in sunny Miami to report on Marco Rubio\u2019s big night. No revelers in sight so far. Once upon a Florida election, Marco Rubio seemed poised to lead Republicans away from their base reputation of stodgy, old white men who like money and telling other people what to do \u2013 though most Americans like money, to be fair, and many don\u2019t mind an occasional foreign intervention. Rubio \u2013 charismatic, pragmatic and Hispanic \u2013 looked like the leader who could bring Spanish-speaking voters into the party and revitalize his party by reaching out to the largest minority group in America. He could be the Republican who reformed immigration. Then Barack Obama started signing executive orders, and Rubio blinked. While once he joined Democrats in voting for a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for people who entered the US illegally, he has now joined the chorus of Republican doomsayers who denounce the president\u2019s immigration orders. At this inchoate stage of his presidential campaign, he has so far kept silent about what could be his most compelling platform or most severe handicap. Others have not, as Talking Points Memo\u2019s Sahil Kapur observes. Even as Americans wait for Clinton to actually say what she might propose to help the middle class, or to diminish inequality, or to do about police brutality, or to rein in the NSA, or to confront Russia in Europe and negotiate with Cuba and Iran, or \u2026 anything really \u2013 despite all these unknowns, New Yorkers seem to like her. That\u2019s not nothing. New Yorkers don\u2019t really like anybody. Hillary Clinton is hitting the trail \u201cwith a great deal of humility,\u201d a senior campaign official has told reporters during a conference call. My colleague Lauren Gambino (@lgamgam) was listening in in on a conference call. \u201cWe understand that we have to earn this,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cWe understand that this is a long process that we are going to take very seriously with a great deal of humility.\u201d This campaign is going to be \u201cwon in states\u201d, they continued, and Clinton is \u201cexcited, energized and anxious to begin\u201d her one-on-one conversations with the people. \u201cWhat we are trying to do with this very first trip to Iowa is to make it very clear that it isn\u2019t about her, it isn\u2019t about us. This is about Iowans, everyday Iowans. Their hopes, their dreams. And what they want in the future.\u201d And as usual, they sang on the same note that the candidates are practically singing in unison: support for the middle class. \u201cThe middle class are the exact people Hillary\u2019s fought for tenaciously her entire life,\u201d an official said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest says President Obama has not endorsed Hillary Clinton yet \u2013 \u201cThere are other people who are friends of the President who may decide to get into the race,\u201d he says, according to Fox News\u2019 Joy Lin. Meanwhile, the Veep himself is out talking about the same themes of Clinton\u2019s first campaign video and many of Jeb Bush\u2019s dress rehearsal speeches. Of the many questions posed to presidential candidates, all are asked one: \u201cwhat have you done?\u201d (It\u2019s often followed by a \u201cfor us recently\u201d.) Marco Rubio has struggled to make a mark on domestic legislation and has instead tried to assert himself on the foreign relations committee. Despite his generally affable relations with Senate veterans, Rubio\u2019s voting record tilts conspicuously toward the Tea party at times. In 2013, he voted not to renew the Violence Against Women Act \u2013 the law that made stalking illegal and set up support systems for women. (The law passed anyway.) Igor Volsky of ThinkProgress has done some digging around for some of Rubio\u2019s more controversial statements and votes, including a 2013 suggestion that he would vote against protecting LGBT people from discrimination at work. Asked about a bill that would offer such protections, he told a reporter \u201cby and large I think that all Americans should be protected but I\u2019m not for any special protections based on orientation.\u201d Rubio has also waffled on climate change, and recently stuck to a trend of railing against Obama administration rules to curb carbon emissions. Rubio does not dispute that something\u2019s changing, but he has also consistently expressed skepticism that humans have anything to do with it. In 2014 he told ABC: \u201cI do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.\u201d He\u2019s square in the middle of the ideological spectrum, however, according to GovTrack \u2013 but has missed more votes than most current senators. You can check out more of Rubio\u2019s votes and positions at GovTrack, VoteSmart and On The Issues. Memes take root. American politicians, too often empleomaniacs without restraint, frequently describe their ambitions in oversized historical terms. If you\u2019re in need of an antidote and some actual American history, check out this review of Mourning Lincoln, about the aftermath of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination 150 years ago Tuesday. Life was anything but simple in postbellum America \u2013 a point that the people running Those who mourned Lincoln wrote of a nation overcome by a \u201cuniversal\u201d grief, but clearly that grief was not universally felt, Hodes notes. Among Confederates, the assassination barely registered compared with the magnitude of their recent defeat. \u201cHeard of Lincoln\u2019s death. Mobile &amp; Columbus lost,\u201d one Confederate officer wrote in his diary. Abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass captured the mix of uncertainty and pessimism. \u201cIt may be,\u201d he posited on the day Lincoln died, \u201cthat the blood of our beloved martyr President will be the salvation of our country.\u201d But a month later, he was far more concerned about oppressive Southern laws and the absence of black suffrage: \u201cIn what new skin will the old snake come forth?\u201d Going back to another American icon oversimplified by many current leaders, the New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker has a happier message. \u201cSeriously?\u201d a Clinton staffer asked the boss when she said she wanted to roadtrip to Iowa in a van. \u201cSeriously,\u201d Clinton confirmed \u2013 according to her aide Huma Abedin, who did not explain why Clinton nicknamed the van \u201cScooby\u201d when Scooby Doo\u2019s van clearly said \u201cthe Mystery Machine\u201d right there on its side. My colleague Paul Lewis (@paullewis) has more on the unorthodox start to the campaign, reporting from Iowa. She will arrive on Tuesday in the small, rural town of Monticello, in Iowa, the first state to choose its Democratic and Republican nominees in January 2016, and the place where her presidential ambitions crumbled seven years ago when she finished third to Barack Obama and John Edwards. \u201cWhen Hillary first told us that she was ready to hit the road for Iowa, we literally looked at her and said, \u2018Seriously?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Seriously,\u2019\u201d her aide, Huma Abedin, told Clinton supporters in a conference call on Sunday night. \u201cThis was her idea, and she\u2019s been really excited about it since she came up with it.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say she surprised quite a few people who had just happened to stop for gas at the same time she did,\u201d Abedin said. Paul notes that Clinton, who has served in the highest echelons of US and world affairs for decades, may \u201cstruggle to have the kind of spontaneous interactions with voters her campaign hopes the road trip will enable.\u201d The campaign likely assumes the risk of that paradox \u2013 \u201cact natural\u201d \u2013 is worth it. In 2008 she in part toured Iowa in a chartered helicopter, which one imagines makes it difficult to shake hands and kiss babies. You can read the full piece here. The 2016 presidential election need not be a circus that only Americans enjoy (or loathe) \u2013 gamblers of all nationalities can get in on the drama too. To that end, bookmakers William Hill and Paddy Power have published their current odds for declared candidates and the politicians lurking in the wings, who may or may not join the contest. To win the Democratic primary, both bookmakers have Clinton as an overwhelming favorite, at 1/3 and 1/4 odds of winning the party\u2019s nomination. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is a distant second, at 5/1 and 13/2, followed by vice-president Joe Biden, at 20/1 odds. Republicans, too, have a strong favorite, but the competitors are far closer. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the third Bush to seek the highest office, has 2/1 odds from both bookmakers to win the nomination. They put Wisconsin governor Scott Walker at 5/1 and 4/1 odds, and at this point the gambling gods disagree. William Hill gives 7/1 odds to senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, while Paddy Power hands the more moderate Rubio an edge at 9/2 and his libertarian rival a 6/1 chance. As for the 2016 presidency itself, both bookmakers agree: Clinton (5/4, 11/10) and Bush (4/1, 4/1) are the titans to beat. Walker (10/1, 12/1) and Rubio (14/1, 12/1) are outliers by comparison. Biden, Cruz and others hardly rank, at current odds of more than 30/1. But odds, like polls, are subject to change, and frontrunners have fallen despite seemingly insurmountable leads before. Just ask Hillary Clinton. Or maybe don\u2019t. Nate Cohn and Harry Enten, the pollster luminaries of the New York Times and FiveThirtyEight respectively, are chatting a bit about Rubio\u2019s chances against his fellow Republicans. On this, Enten says he concurs. Not to be outdone by the slickly produced videos of Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul, Rubio has released a video of his own. Viewers beware: it\u2019s heavy on thoughtful piano tinkling over Rubio talking about his parents, ominous synth strings over some talk about the Obama administration, and then the inevitable combo of rising, inspirational guitar and piano chords. \u201cA new American century,\u201d is the gist of the pitch, and clearly Rubio wants to run on foreign policy bona fides (he serves on the Senate foreign relations committee). Not once in the video \u2013 a compilation of other speeches roughly cut together \u2013 does Rubio mention immigration. But it beats the 30-second \u201cWe\u2019re ready for Hillary\u201d video that Ted Cruz released on Sunday. Rubio\u2019s early announcement that he\u2019s running for president came in a call to his major donors, AP reports. The first-term Republican from Florida told his biggest backers on a conference call on Monday that he sees the coming presidential campaign as a choice between the past and the future. In a swipe at Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rubio said the former first lady \u201cis a leader from yesterday.\u201d Rubio says he has always felt the United States is about tomorrow. Rubio spoke on a conference call with donors before a flashy political rally set for Monday night in Miami. In the tradition of his fellow candidates, Florida senator Marco Rubio has pre-empted a big campaign speech tonight \u2013 his is scheduled for this evening in Miami \u2013 with an early announcement, the AP reports. Rubio says he feels \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to talk about the future, the agency reports. Windows rolled down, the van cruising 10mph over the speed limit through the undecided sectors of Ohio, the most trusted intern at the helm, and the stereo blasting Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born to Run \u2013 Hillary Clinton is on a roadtrip to Iowa, on a mission to win Americans\u2019 hearts. Or at least that\u2019s one way to imagine it. She could also be sealed up behind the tinted windows of a nondescript but custom-built super van, equipped with polling computers and a Darth Vader-esque meditation chamber from which the former secretary of state briefly emerges to interact with a populace that is startled by her steely resolve to conquer America. Or it could be somewhere in between. We don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ll do our best to find out, as we follow Clinton on her road trip to Iowa today - and, later, watch Republican senator Marco Rubio launch his own presidential campaign in Miami. He will join two other declared Republican candidates, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Welcome to our coverage of the 2016 presidential race.
