It was downhill all the way after that in the first game of the season. The Pittsburgh Pirates won 10-1. Bush was only a stand-in. The Reds had invited his son but George W declined without explanation. He is understood to have had a more pressing engagement. The pre-game ceremonies at the Great American Ball Park were wrapped in a patriotic theme. The Reds' owner Carl Lindner began by paying tribute to US troops in the Persian Gulf, and fans, primed with American flags placed on each of the 42,263 seats, waved to order. Then two transport planes from an Ohio military base flew overhead before the former president walked on to the field in a black Reds jacket, threw a strike to the Reds' shortstop Barry Larkin and waved his arms in delight at the on-target throw as the crowd roared. He had been a left-handed first baseman at Yale University. Bush then walked to a microphone behind home plate and told the crowd it was an honour \"to be off the bench substituting for another guy you know, the president of the United States of America\". Bush is an old hand at the ceremonial pitch in Cincinnati. As vice-president he threw one before the All-Star game at Riverfront Stadium in 1988. He planned to throw another before the second game of the 1990 World Series in Cincinnati, when troops were preparing for the first Gulf war, but he ended up leaving it to his wife and first lady Barbara. In the preamble at Great American Ball Park Lee Greenwood sang Proud To Be An American but it was not long before some fans were wondering if he could write an alternative, Not Proud To Be A Reds Fan. It was the worst beating ever for a home team opening a new playpen. \"They were just getting us back for what we did to them two years ago,\" said the Reds' first baseman Sean Casey, referring to an 8-2 beating the Reds put on the Pirates when they opened PNC Park in 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
