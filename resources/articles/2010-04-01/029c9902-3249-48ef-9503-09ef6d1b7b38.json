Sir Nikolaus Pevsner in his guide to North Somerset and Bristol writes: \"Fine E view, with, in the foreground, a sycamore planted in 1750,\" and \"Nearly as fine, the view from the W with the tower behind a cedar tree.\" When a history of Batcombe by Captain GT Coney OBE RN, kindly sent to me by a Country diary reader, drew me back to that churchyard, the views across valleys and heights lived up to expectation; to the south, broken cloud and a blue sky made a shifting pattern of light and shade on the steeply sloping planes of the hillsides. Coney's book gives some remarkable nuggets of information. Between 1910 and 1914, for example, the postman walked from Evercreech to Upton Noble, some five miles, with the mail, and spent the day in a hut there, where he cut hair for threepence and gave violin lessons before walking the afternoon mail back to Evercreech. We read that the Rev Thomas Coney, clerk, was one of the founders of the village school (1826) whose neatly symmetrical building, now a village hall, still stands at the edge of the churchyard. The trustees laid down uncompromising conditions of employment for the master and mistress; they were to be members of the Church of England, of sober life and conversation, and frequenters of the Holy Communion, and were to bring the children to church on Sunday. Late in the 19th century there were no fewer than seven railway stations within five miles of the village, and good connections by horse and cart. It was possible to have fish from Hull or Grimsby in the house less than 24 hours after dispatch from the quayside. The altered disposition of 100 village dwellings between 1938 and the late 1950s indicates typical mid-century changes in village life. By the later date, 15 workers' cottages had become holiday homes as against only two before the war, and 23 families (as against only four) had come to Batcombe to retire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
