Inter Miami CF, the new MLS club owned by David Beckham set to make their debut next month, suffered a setback in the first round of the proceedings when the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) dismissed one of the team\u2019s two arguments, according to a report published Monday. Miami attorney David Winker, writing for Law.com, said the Italian club appears to have overcome the significant legal threshold of \u201clikely confusion\u201d, adding he believes the ruling \u201cwill result in Miami having to change its name\u201d. \u201cThe USPTO found that MLS\u2019 claim that there are a number of clubs around the world that use Inter in their name \u2013 SC Internacional of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Inter Nashville FC, Inter Atlanta FC, FC Inter Turku (Finland), NK Inter Zapresic (Croatia), Inter Leipzig (Germany) and Inter de Grand-Goave (Haiti) \u2013 did not meet its burden to show that MLS has valid proprietary, or ownership, right in the name, Inter,\u201d the report said. The Miami New Times reported Internazionale submitted a trademark application to the USPTO in 2014 to make \u2018Inter\u2019 and exclusive brand in the United States, barring other clubs from marketing themselves with the same shorthand, while Inter Miami CF\u2019s subsequent application in 2018 has been suspended. MLS\u2019s outlined a two-pronged argument in a notice of opposition filed last year against Internazionale\u2019s application: that \u2018Inter\u2019 is a widely used shorthand in soccer and that a trademark on the term will cause a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d among the various teams that already use it. But last month, the patent office\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d claim and said the league didn\u2019t meet those requirements, Winker wrote. The trademark battle is the latest bump in the rocky gestation for Beckham\u2019s club, including a protracted struggle over stadium construction, objections from cruise lines, ludicrous demands from private landowners, calls to build a high school on the complex and, most recently, the discovery of arsenic contamination at the golf course where the 25,000-seat Miami Freedom Park will be built. Inter Miami (for now, anyway) are scheduled to play the first home game in club history on 14 March against LA Galaxy after opening with back-to-back road matches at LAFC and DC United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
