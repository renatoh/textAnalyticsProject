I firmly believe the players do not deserve this finding. They do not deserve to face a 12-month suspension from the sport. This is a miscarriage of justice for 34 young men.\u201d AFL Players Association CEO Paul Marsh \u201cWe have maintained our position that the players have done nothing wrong. Nothing today has changed our view. The players took all reasonable steps to assure themselves that what they were being given was compliant with the Wada code. They [the players] are the victims, not the perpetrators. They deserve our sympathy, not our scorn.\u201d AFL Commission chairman Mike Fitzpatrick \u201cThe program at Essendon Football Club in 2012 was a stain on our game. This has been a very dark period. The last four years will not define the Essendon Football Club. The integrity of our competition, the health of our players, are the most important things in our game.\u201d AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan \u201cIt is our view that they [the players] have been horribly let down by the [Essendon] administration of the time. The AFL will support the players and the club through this period but these suspensions must stand.\u201d Former Wada president John Fahey \u201cThe reality of the matter is that the individual player is the responsible party. The strict liability applies to every athlete in the world, including Essendon players or any football player. That\u2019s the simple facts of how the code works.\u201d Former Essendon player Matthew Lloyd \u201cIt opens a pandora\u2019s box \u2013 it\u2019s Essendon\u2019s and the AFL\u2019s worst nightmare. Players have lost their careers, lost their livelihoods, the stress on the families, themselves. Probably another write off for Essendon in regards to playing finals football \u2013 how much can the supporters take it anymore? That\u2019s devastating for everyone involved in the AFL fraternity.\u201d AFL journalist Rohan Connolly Sports minister Susan Ley \u201cRegardless of the outcome, this case has also highlighted clear community expectations that clubs and their coaching staff do have a moral obligation to care for a player\u2019s health and safety. Athletes take guidance from those leading them and should be able to trust in the institutions through which they compete.\u201d Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten \u201cMy thoughts are first and foremost not about trying to say Liberal or Labor, who is better, who is worse. These young players are the meat in the sandwich ... caught up in something which they never, from what I\u2019ve seen, understood.\u201d Former AFL player Graham Cornes Asada CEO Ben McDevitt \u201cThis unfortunate episode has chronicled the most devastating self-inflicted injury by a sporting club in Australian history. There were very little grounds for the players to claim they were at no significant fault.\u201d Now retired Essendon player Nathan Lovett-Murray AFL great Wayne Carey Fairfax columnist Roy Masters \u201cThe relentless and ultimately successful pursuit of Essendon by anti-doping agencies for a guilty verdict and a meaningful suspension was driven by their conviction that if an AFL Tribunal had heard the case against Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist would still have seven Tour de France titles.\u201d Former AFL player and code-hopper Karmichael Hunt Port Adelaide general manager of football Chris Davies \u201cClearly, we are extremely disappointed with today\u2019s outcome and in particular we are devastated for Angus [Monfries] and Paddy [Ryder] who have been through so much already. This has been a long, drawn out process for both of them and we are most unhappy that it has ended with such a significant suspension. First and foremost, we will look to support Angus and Paddy in every possible way during their time on the sidelines. We are very proud as to how Angus and Paddy have handled this whole process and as a club we will stand by them all the way.\u201d Australian basketball star Andrew Bogut Australian Paralympian Ben Newton"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
