So maintained Jim Collins in Uncommon Cultures: Popular Culture and Postmodernism . The double city of Fritz Lang's Metropolis - in which \"the State is conceived as one enormous circular Grand Hotel where the evil capitalist bosses reside at the top and the workers reside in the basement\" - plays a role in Collins's analysis of the fragmentation of cultural authority. Uncommon Cultures was published in 1989, perhaps the zenith of postmodernism. Since then, notions of cultural fragmentation (as something to lament) and cultural diversity (as something to celebrate) have been boxing and coxing. Now come two books that use hotels as a means of testing connections between different social discourses. Paul Theroux's riotous Hotel Honolulu foregrounds cultural difference and competing values on its opening page: \"Buddy, the hotel's owner, said, 'We're multi-story.' I liked the word and the way he made it multi-eye .\" The narrator who likes the word is a writer. Blocked after two decades of success, he finds himself appointed manager of the Hawaiian hotel of the title simply because he is a \"howlie\", someone from the mainland US and therefore to be trusted. Reckless millionaire owner Buddy Hamstra is the Falstaffian figure at the centre of a series of loosely connected episodes detailing the triumphs and travails of the staff, guests and hangers-on. These are later reframed as the redeemed writer's stories, written mostly while he is sitting in his hotel manager's office. Otherwise he reads Anna Karenina or James Michener's howlie-eyed epic Hawaii , or presides at the hotel bar, the Paradise Lost. Right from the start things are not what they seem. \"'My manager's a typical local howlie - a reetard,' Buddy said. 'Fondles the help. Always cockroaching booze. Sniffs round the guest rooms.'\" He is, it becomes apparent, talking about himself, using some of the Hawaiian English that is one of the features of this glorious, smutty, all-encompassing book. One of its main themes is the role of literature in a debased culture. Or, as the native Hawaiian maintenance men put it as they sprawl on the hotel lawns: \"'Yah. Howlie bugga office. Big book. Hybolical book.' 'Eh, no easy fo read, yah.' 'Too much easy for howlie.' 'Yah.' 'Yah. Bymbye, da howlie bugga be rascal.' 'Frikken big rascal.'\" This conversation is in the ambit of \"talk story\", the native oral tradition that runs alongside references to the written books (Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry James, Malinowski) that underpin other parts of the narrative. Theroux, or his writer, makes the oral/ written distinction clear. \"At about the time Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales , the second and largest wave of Polynesians were climbing out of double-hulled canoes, chanting in relief at having found land.\" But neither orality nor early arrival gives the Polynesians cultural or moral primacy: \"They claimed it as theirs, but they were no more than castaways. They imposed a society of kings and commoners. People were eaten. They venerated the gods of fire and water they had brought with them . . . The voyagers had brought pigs and dogs. The first whites brought guns and gonorrhea.\" All that links these uncommon cultures is decay (\"everything began at once and in that beginning was decay\") and the virtuous-seeming sun: \"so dazzling, so misleading\". Theroux, like Philip Roth in his last couple of books, is searingly negative about contemporary culture, but as with Roth you hear a bark of self-loathing delight as he hunkers down in the absurd, barbaric mulch of what's about him. The novel references pieces of Theroux's own biography, including time in Africa, a failed marriage in England and flight to the Pacific (the material of this story). It even mentions \"the detailed autobiographical fantasies of my fiction\": a complex manoeuvre, given that a half-version of Theroux is checking in earlier half-versions as part of the naturalistic baggage of establishing his own character as narrator of Hotel Honolulu . The writer/narrator plays a similar role to that of \"Chaucer\" in the prologue to The Canterbury Tales , managing the enterprise of the story just as he manages that of the hotel. One by one we are introduced to the sequence of strange pilgrims who are there as guests or staff: Puamana Wilson, the original \"coconut princess\" and call girl to President Kennedy; barman Trey and his band Sub-Dude; Pinky, the Filipina wife Buddy buys, who has to follow him round with an oxygen bottle after an operation; Madame Ma the oversexed gossip columnist . . . These are all grotesque and wonderful creations, but perhaps the most important character is a real one, the late biographer of Henry James, Leon Edel. Elegant, frail and a friend of Theroux's in life, he is used here to provide an oblique high-cultural angle (\"old gold\") on the otherwise barbaric action - the clerk's tale, as it were. Ali Smith's Hotel World is another clerk's tale, in so far as it is packed full of literary allusions and cunning devices. A panoptical view of five characters in and around the Global - a plush hotel in a grim northern English town, in which the system is \"not functioning properly\" - the story is handled very knowingly. In fact, I have never seen the tenets of recent literary theory (the impossibility of the coherent subject, or substantive character, for instance) so cleverly insinuated into a novel. Take this scene in which Smith mocks the reader's desire for narrative thrust. The \"character\" in question, chambermaid and champion swimmer Sara Wilby, has just plunged to her death in \"the lift for the dishes\" and is telling the story post-mortem: \"(That's the name for it, the name for it; that 's it; dumb waiter dumb waiter dumb waiter.) - and here's the story, since you're so desperate for one.\" The other characters include Penny, a journalist with a broken PowerBook (apt shades of Jeanette Winterson's latest novel, The.Powerbook ), Sara's sister Clare, a beggar-girl called Else, and Lise the melancholic receptionist (less apt shades of Anita Brookner's Hotel du Lac ). The Lise/Else wordplay is typical of Smith, who made her name with a volume called Other Stories and Other Stories . This is a writer who is committed to conveying otherness in interesting and exciting ways: every detail in the book, from Penny's name to Else's gnomic \"spr sm chn?\" on the pavement outside, serves to question the capitalist assumptions of the Global, with its surveillance cameras and 78% polyester uniforms. For all its radical virtues, many readers will find Smith's a difficult book to swallow. \"Eh, no easy fo read, yah,\" as Theroux's maintenance men would put it. The truth is, we like our falsely coherent subjects and illusions of unfractured language. Such snarled-up reality as we can bear must come disguised in traditional forms, its postmodern aspects symbolically rendered, as in Hotel Honolulu , rather than formally enacted, as in Hotel World . But times are changing, readers are learning. In the case of Smith and other, mainly American writers (Dave Eggers, Mark House of Leaves Danielewski and Jonathan Lethem), books are being produced that seem specifically designed to be read by a generation brought up on theory. The radicalism is soon worn off, though, as what was avant-garde is rapidly and easily absorbed by the marketplace: Smith and Theroux, it is worth noting, share the same publisher. In spite of the hopeful predictions of the postmodernist sages of a decade ago, it seems that the \"totalisable system\" of capitalist culture is alive and well. At least it means one is able to buy books easily. With respect to these two at least, I'd recommend doing so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
