The president also alleged widespread voter fraud and insisted that he was getting along swimmingly state governors, who have increasingly found themselves at odds with him as they respond to the crisis. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the crisis has shined \u201ca bright light\u201d on the racial disparities in the US. Data from some states and cities suggest that the pandemic is disproportionately killing Black Americans. Memos revealed that Trump was warned in January of the severity of the coronavirus crisis. The president insisted he never saw the warnings from his economic adviser Peter Navarro. Acting navy secretary Thomas Modly resigned over insulting comments he made about Captain Brett Crozier, the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt who raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus on the ship. Trump removed a Pentagon official tapped to oversee the coronavirus relief effort from his post. Acting Pentagon inspector general Glenn Fine was supposed to oversee implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus bill, but an agency spokesperson confirmed he is no longer in the role. New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll yet. The state has recorded 5,489 deaths linked to the virus, up from 4,758 a day earlier, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing today. The White House announced an overhaul of its communications team. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham is returning to the first lady\u2019s staff after never having held a single White House briefing in more than nine months. She will be replaced by Kayleigh McEnany, who currently serves as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Congress is seeking to allocate additional funds to the small business loan program established by the stimulus package. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would ask Congress to add $250 billion to the program, which was originally given $350 billion under the stimulus package passed last month. During the briefing, Trump also repeatedly insisted that he never daw top White House adviser\u2019s Peter Navarro\u2019s memos, which warned officials in late January the coronavirus crisis could put millions of Americans\u2019 health at risk, and cost the country trillions. Here\u2019s more on the memos, from my colleagues Ed Pilkington and Martin Pengelly: Fact check: testing During the taskforce briefing, Trump said \u2013 once again \u2013 that the United States \u201ccontinues to perform more tests than anywhere else in the world, and that\u2019s why we have more cases\u201d. While the US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered, it has conducted fewer tests per capita given the US population is over six times larger than South Korea\u2019s. As of 7 April, the United States, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 1,951,044 tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a group led by Alexis Madrigal, a staff writer for The Atlantic magazine, with more than 100 volunteers that compile coronavirus testing data from states. This equates to 582 tests per 100,000 people in the US (with huge variations depending on the county, city and state), compared with 709 tests per 100,000 in South Korea and 600 per 100,000 in Italy. The US rate of testing improved markedly in early April. On March 31 the rate was just 318 per 100,000. Why do Americans need AR-15 rifles during a global pandemic? To shoot \u201clooting hordes from Atlanta.\u201d That\u2019s the campaign message from a former Republican congressman from Georgia, Paul Broun, who is now running for congress again. Broun lives in Gainesville, Georgia, a city that is 87% white, and that is about an hour outside of Atlanta, the state capital, which is majority-black. In a new campaign video, Broun promises to give away an AR-15 rifle \u201cto one lucky person who signs up for email updates\u201d from his campaign website. \u201cWhether it\u2019s looting hordes from Atlanta or a tyrannical government from Washington, there are few better liberty machines than an AR-15.\u201d In a phone interview Tuesday, Broun defended his message as \u201cnot racial.\u201d \u201cOnly the liberal press would take that kind of position,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of white people in Atlanta as well.\u201d \u201cMa\u2019am, I have been a keynote speaker at an MLK Day celebration,\u201d he said. Broun was dismissive of the idea that his rhetoric might concern black Georgia residents, or that this kind of rhetoric might increase the risk of innocent black Americans getting shot while in majority-white neighborhoods. \u201cYou\u2019re the racist,\u201d he added. Asked what evidence he had that the coronavirus pandemic might result in hordes of looters, Broun referenced civil unrest in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, both majority-black cities where police killings of unarmed black men led to sustained protests over police treatment of black Americans. Broun, who had a reputation as one of the most conservative members of the GOP during his eight years in Congress, left office in 2015 under the shadow of an ethics investigation into his former chief of staff over taxpayer dollars spent to hire a political consultant known as the \u201ctea party whisperer.\u201d Dr. Birx pushed back against reports that coronavirus deaths are underreported due to a lack of testing and delays in reporting. \u201cI think the reporting here has been pretty straightforward over the past five to six weeks,\u201d she said. Though rural areas may face issues accessing tests to diagnose, Birx said she doesn\u2019t see it as a problem overall. The New York Times reported earlier: With no uniform system for reporting coronavirus-related deaths in the United States, and a continued shortage of tests, some states and counties have improvised, obfuscated and, at times, backtracked in counting the dead. \u201cWe definitely think there are deaths that we have not accounted for,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, which studies global health threats and is closely tracking the coronavirus pandemic. Late last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance for how to certify coronavirus deaths, underscoring the need for uniformity and reinforcing the sense by health care workers and others that deaths have not been consistently tracked. In its guidance, the C.D.C. instructed officials to report deaths where the patient has tested positive or, in an absence of testing, \u201cif the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci added that \u201chealth disparities have always existed for the African American community but here, again, with this crisis, it\u2019s shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is.\u201d Although \u201cwe will get over coronavirus,\u201d he added, \u201cthere will still be health disparities.\u201d Dr Deborah Birx clarified that African Americans are not more \u201csusceptible\u201d to coronavirus. \u201cWhat our data suggests is that they are more susceptible to more difficult and severe disease and poorer outcomes,\u201d she said. Data from cities including Chicago and Philadelphia show stark racial disparities in coronavirus patients and fatalities. White House official Seema Verma said that Medicare data will be looking at race and underlying conditions, and the president earlier promised that more statistics on racial disparities will be revealed in the next week. Fact check: coronavirus deaths \u201cI think they\u2019re pretty accurate on the death counts,\u201d Trump told reporters. But doctors disagree. Delays in reporting and a continuing lack of widespread testing mean that more people have died of coronavirus than the official count. Doctors also believe that deaths in February and early March \u2014 before the coronavirus was recognized as an epidemic in the US \u2014 that were attributed to influenza or pneumonia, were likely due to Covid-19. Fact check: vote-by-mail The president has left the briefing room, leaving it to Mike Pence and health officials to answer the remaining questions. Before he exited, he once again falsely claimed that recent elections were marred by voter fraud, insisting that millions of people voted illegally in 2016 which cost him the popular vote. But extensive research has found that voter fraud is rare and virtually nonexistent. Trump zeroed in on mail-in ballots, claiming the process is \u201ccorrupt\u201d and susceptible to widespread fraud. \u201cYou get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody\u2019s living room, signing somebody\u2019s ballot,\u201d he said. I n the 5 states that have moved to an entirely vote-by-mail systems, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. More states are considering expanding their vote-by-mail systems amid the coronavirus pandemic as a way to keep voters and poll workers safe. But the moves are widely opposed by Republicans, as was the case in Wisconsin, which held its primary election on Tuesday despite calls and legal challenges to postpone the election. It should be noted, once again, that Trump voted by mail-in ballot in Florida last month. Additionally, the most significant episode of mail-in ballot fraud in recent years involved a Republican congressional candidate in North Carolina. The election was overturned. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine Trump loves to tout hydroxychloroquine. Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided the drug with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug. But experts say it\u2019s too early to call it a cure. What is hydroxychloroquine? Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water. It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19. Why is Trump touting it? Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others. However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d. Trump is again touting hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, which has not yet been proven effective against the coronavirus. The repeated a story about a Democratic state lawmaker who credits hydroxychloroquine and Trump for her recovery from Covid-19. \u201cI really think it\u2019s a great thing to try, just based on what I know,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not a doctor. Get a physician\u2019s approval.\u201d Here\u2019s more on that state representative, from the Detroit Free Press: State Rep. Karen Whitsett, who learned Monday she has tested positive for COVID-19, said she started taking hydroxychloroquine on March 31, prescribed by her doctor, after both she and her husband sought treatment for a range of symptoms on March 18. \u201cIt was less than two hours\u201d before she started to feel relief, said Whitsett, who had experienced shortness of breath, swollen lymph nodes, and what felt like a sinus infection. She is still experiencing headaches, she said. Whitsett said she was familiar with \u201cthe wonders\u201d of hydroxychloroquine from an earlier bout with Lyme disease, but does not believe she would have thought to ask for it, or her doctor would have prescribed it, had Trump not been touting it as a possible treatment for COVID-19. \u201cMail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country,\u201d the president said. The ballots are \u201cforgeries in many cases - it\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d he added, citing no evidence to back the claim. Trump himself voted by mail \u2014 in March. Fact check: Travel restrictions Trump took credit for \u201cclosing down the borders\u201d to China, and then later to Europe. In fact, he placed restrictions on travel from China but did not totally close it down, as he has repeatedly claimed. Trump also touted his decision to restrict travel from Europe to the US, but the initial order included only 26 countries that are part of the Schengen Area. He later added Ireland the UK but the restrictions still excluded a number of European countries. Contradicting what he said just minutes ago, Trump is now denying that he\u2019s saying the US will strop funding the WHO. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI said I\u2019d look at it. \u201cThey did give us some pretty bad play-calling,\u201d Trump said of the WHO. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a lot of heat.\u201d Moreover, \u201csocial media\u201d suggested to him that the organization was biased toward China, the president claimed. Trump said he had \u201cno role\u201d in Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly\u2019s resignation. \u201cI would not have asked him,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to resign but he felt it would be better for the country.\u201d Modly resigned after leaked audio revealed he called the former commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to be in charge, in an address to the ship\u2019s crew. Captain Brett Crozier, the former commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, had sent a memo warning that coronavirus spreading among the crew. After the memo leaked, Modly fired Crozier. Trump\u2019s take? Crozier shouldn\u2019t have written a letter, because \u201che\u2019s not Ernest Hemingway\u201d. The president announced that the US will stop sending money to the World Health Organization, even as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Finding a scapegoat, the president blamed the WHO for the crisis, noting that they \u201cblew it\u201d. \u201cThey called it wrong. They called it wrong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey missed the call. They could\u2019ve called it months earlier.\u201d Trump repeatedly downplayed the crisis even after the WHO \u201ccalled it\u201d a pandemic. Fact check: Governors Trump claimed that he\u2019s getting along swimmingly with the nation\u2019s governors. But that is a rosy read of the relationship. For weeks, governors have pleaded with the administration to do more, walking a fine line as they criticize what the view is a chaotic federal response while also trying not to alienate the famously prickly president. \u201cIf they had started in February building ventilators, getting ready for this pandemic, we would not have the problems we are having today and, frankly, very many fewer people would die,\u201d Illinois governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday Context: Coronavirus and racial disparities Addressing the impact of coronavirus on Black communities, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that \u201cwe\u2019ve known literally forever that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity and asthma are disproportionately affecting minority populations, especially the African Americans.\u201d Those underlying conditions put people at greater risk for complications from coronavirus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it right now,\u201d Fauci said. What the top health official didn\u2019t get into were the reasons why people of color are at greater risk - which include a lack of access to health care, especially preventative care, and the \u201cweathering\u201d effect of facing racism. Federal officials could, of course, make it easier for people to access healthcare, right now. But the Trump administration has resisted reopening the public health exchanges to allow the uninsured to get health insurance. Donald Trump said he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that other countries have more coronavirus cases, but are reporting misleading or wrong numbers, without providing any evidence to back up the claim. \u201cWhen you look at some of these large countries, I know for a fact they have more cases than we do but they don\u2019t report them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s been great coordination, especially over the last little while\u201d between the federal government and states, Trump said. But, he added, \u201cif you have a governor that\u2019s failing, we\u2019re going to protect you.\u201d \u201cWe pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s going through a lot. Johnson has \u201calways been very good to us,\u201d he added. \u201cWe appreciate it.\u201d Senior administration official Seema Varma and Dr Deborah Birx have joined the president today. Utah representative Ben McAdams is reportedly doing better, after contracting the coronavirus. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi, blogging from the West Coast. We\u2019re awaiting a coronavirus briefing at 5:30. We\u2019ll be fact-checking and contextualizing the president\u2019s claims throughout, as usual. In the meantime, here\u2019s a little pre-debate fact-check. During a meeting on small business relief, Donald Trump claimed that his daughter Ivanka Trump created 15m jobs. Per Vox\u2019s Ian Millhiser, that would amount to about 10% of all American jobs. Billionaire tech executive Jack Dorsey explained his decision to commit $1 billion in stocks to supporting coronavirus relief in a series of tweets. \u201cWhy now?\u201d wrote Dorsey, who is the CEO of two public companies, Twitter and Square. \u201cThe needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime. I hope this inspires others to do something similar. Life is too short, so let\u2019s do everything we can today to help people now. \u201d Dorsey is not making a straightforward donation. Instead, he is planning to transfer $1bn in Square stock to Start Small LLC, a limited liability corporation that he established in 2015 to house his charitable work. LLCs are not subject to the same disclosure requirements that tax-exempt charitable donations are, but Dorsey also published a Google spreadsheet that he said would be used to disclose all of his grants. Dorsey said the structure \u201cprovides flexibility.\u201d The first donation on the spreadsheet is a $100,000 gift to America\u2019s Food Fund, which has raised more than $13m on GoFundMe to combat hunger in the US. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Acting navy secretary Thomas Modly resigned over insulting comments he made about Captain Brett Crozier, the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt who raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus on the ship. Trump removed a Pentagon official tapped to oversee the coronavirus relief effort from his post. Acting Pentagon inspector general Glenn Fine was supposed to oversee implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus bill, but an agency spokesperson confirmed he is no longer in the role. New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll yet. The state has recorded 5,489 deaths linked to the virus, up from 4,758 a day earlier, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing today. The White House announced an overhaul of its communications team. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham is returning to the first lady\u2019s staff after never having held a single White House briefing in more than nine months. She will be replaced by Kayleigh McEnany, who currently serves as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Congress is seeking to allocate additional funds to the small business loan program established by the stimulus package. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would ask Congress to add $250 billion to the program, which was originally given $350 billion under the stimulus package passed last month. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump said he would discuss Peter Navarro\u2019s January memo warning of a potential coronavirus pandemic at his press conference today. \u201cI know all about it,\u201d Trump said of the memo, which was first reported on by Axios and the New York Times last night. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it at the press conference,\u201d Trump added. In the memo, Navarro, Trump\u2019s told trade adviser, reportedly warned that the coronavirus outbreak had the potential to turn into a pandemic, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans and devastating the US economy. The memo\u2019s existence undermines claims from Trump and many of his advisers that the administration was not properly warned about the potential impact of the virus. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he would commit $1 billion of his wealth to helping coronavirus relief efforts. The financial commitment appears to be the largest one yet from a billionaire, although a number of the world\u2019s wealthiest people have donated funds to various coronavirus relief efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, donated $100 million to food banks helping with the crisis, but he has faced criticism over how he has treated his own workers as demand for Amazon products has increased amid the pandemic. Some Wisconsin voters are saying they never received their absentee ballots for today\u2019s primary, despite requesting them before the deadline. Without an absentee ballot, voters are left with an unappealing choice between going to an in-person polling site and not voting at all, increasing the likelihood that many people will be disenfranchised. Sam Levine reports: Milwaukee resident Molly Brunner, 25, requested her absentee ballot on 18 March, but it never came. She went to the polls first thing Tuesday morning, but the line was too long, so she left and came back later. She waited about 40 minutes in line to vote. ... Joe Ashworth, 30, another Milwaukee resident, said he didn\u2019t receive his ballot after requesting it in mid-March. He went to the polls on Tuesday morning and wound up waiting two hours in line to vote. Amelia Brummond, 34, submitted her request for a ballot for herself and her husband on 12 March. Her husband\u2019s ballot came weeks later, but hers never came. She said she tried to follow up with election officials in Milwaukee, but never got an answer. Brummond, who has five children, said she won\u2019t go to the polls on Tuesday because it\u2019s too risky. She wanted to vote in a school measure that was on the ballot, but won\u2019t be able to. \u2018I can\u2019t bring coronavirus into my house,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019m just going to have to opt out.\u2019 Wisconsin state House speaker Robin Vos assured voters they are \u201cincredibly safe to go out,\u201d but the Republican leader undermined that message somewhat by making it while covered in personal protective equipment. Vos and the Republican majority leader of the state Senate challenged Democratic governor Tony Evers\u2019 executive order to cancel in-person voting for today\u2019s election, an order that was later blocked by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Some voters in Milwaukee are reporting wait times of up to two hours today after all but five of the city\u2019s polling sites were closed after poll workers quit over concerns about coronavirus. Defense secretary Mark Esper has accepted acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly\u2019s resignation, according to a CNN reporter. Esper reportedly pressured Modly to apologize after the acting Navy secretary said Captain Brett Crozier was \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to command a ship if he thought his letter raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus wouldn\u2019t be leaked. Modly issued a statement apologizing last night after initially standing by his original comments. James McPherson, the acting undersecretary of the Army, has been tapped to succeed Thomas Modly as acting Navy secretary, according to the Wall Street Journal. Modly, who served as both acting secretary and permanent undersecretary of the Navy, will reportedly resign from both roles over his comments about Captain Brett Crozier. Acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly was originally unwilling to apologize for his comments attacking Captain Brett Crozier, but he did so after Trump said he would \u201cget involved\u201d in the matter. \u201cI want to apologize to the Navy for my recent comments to the crew of the TR,\u201d Modly said in a statement released last night. \u201cLet me be clear, I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is na\u00efve nor stupid. I think, and always believed him to be the opposite.\u201d Asked about Modly\u2019s comments hours earlier at his daily coronavirus briefing, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get involved and see exactly what\u2019s going on there. Because I don\u2019t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day.\u201d Acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly has reportedly offered to resign amid an uproar over his harsh comments criticizing Captain Brett Crozier. Politico reports: Modly submitted his resignation letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday after meeting with his boss one-on-one, that official said. Neither Esper nor the White House pressured Modly to resign, the official said, and it is unclear whether Esper will accept it. A number of Democratic lawmakers, including House speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called on Modly to be removed from his post after he attacked Crozier in a speech to the captain\u2019s former crew members. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling for the removal of acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly after he lambasted Captain Brett Crozier, who tried to raise concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship. \u201cActing Secretary Modly\u2019s actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cHe showed a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership needed during this time. Acting Secretary Modly must be removed from his position or resign.\u201d Modly harshly criticized Crozier in a speech yesterday to the crew members of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which Crozier used to command. Crozier was removed from the post after his letter sharing concerns about an outbreak on the ship were made public. In his speech, Modly said Crozier was either \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to command the ship if he didn\u2019t think the letter would be leaked. Modly\u2019s speech was promptly leaked as well. The acting secretary initially stood by his comments but later apologized under pressure. In her statement, Pelosi applauded Crozier for demanding that his crew be allowed to quarantine to avoid spreading the virus. \u201cOur oath of office is to protect and defend the Constitution, and therefore our first responsibility is to protect and defend the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cTo that end, our priority is force protection of our men and women in uniform who sacrifice to keep Americans safe. That is exactly what Captain Crozier was doing when he called for help for the men and women in his charge.\u201d Most of the voting delays in Wisconsin appear to be centralized in Milwaukee, where only five polling places are open for today\u2019s primary. In comparison, Madison, which has less than half the population of Milwaukee, has 66 polling sites open. Wauwatosa, a city that borders Milwaukee and has a population of 48,000 has 10 polling sites open. The lack of polling locations in Milwaukee is particularly disconcerting because the city is majority minority, while the state as a whole is 85% white. The first congressman to be diagnosed with coronavirus has now recovered from his illness. Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart said he has reunited with his family in Miami after spending three weeks in Washington as he recovered from the virus. \u201cIt has not been an easy journey,\u201d the congressman wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThere were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return. Thankfully, I never experienced shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or issues with my heart.\u201d Diaz-Balart said he intended to donate his plasma to help other coronavirus patients and urged others have tested positive to do the same. The Republican congressman announced his diagnosis about three weeks ago. Several lawmakers have since said they have also contracted the virus. California is sending 100 ventilators to New Jersey as the state deals with a surge of coronavirus cases, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced. Murphy said in a tweet that the state was \u201cbeyond grateful\u201d to California and would \u201crepay the favor when California needs it.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom announced yesterday that the state was loaning 500 state-owned ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile to help states that are currently hard hit by the pandemic. New Jersey is the only state besides New York that has reported more than 1,000 deaths linked to the virus. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said the state would start reporting the race of coronavirus patients amid concerns that African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards said yesterday that African Americans have accounted for more than 70% of the state\u2019s coronavirus deaths, even though they make up about a third of the population. \u201cObviously this is a big disparity,\u201d Edwards said. In Michigan, data indicates that more than 40% of those who have died from the virus were African American, even though only 14% of the state\u2019s population is black. Dr Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, said African Americans may be disproportionately suffering from the virus because they are more likely to have preexisting conditions that complicate the illness, like diabetes and heart disease. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would ask Congress to allocate an additional $250 billion to the small business loan program, which was created under the $2 trillion stimulus bill that Trump signed last month. The stimulus bill originally allocated $350 billion in funds for loans to small businesses, many of which have been closed in recent weeks due to social distancing restrictions. When the program opened Friday, banks received a flood of applications, as business owners feared the funding would soon run out. The additional money will likely help to alleviate some of those concerns. Some rather harsh reactions to the news that Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany will be Donald Trump\u2019s fourth White House press secretary. Norm Eisen, a Brookings fellow who was White House ethics czar under Barack Obama, kicked off one string with a tweet in which he said: \u201cI have debated her a couple times on TV. I am struggling for a diplomatic way to put this but \u2026 when the producer told me she was a graduate of Harvard Law I thought I was being pranked.\u201d Some answers from some prominent people who perhaps ought to have thought twice before tweeting, given the potential for adding fuel to anti-media and anti-liberal fires forever burning among Trump supporters: Jared Huffman, a California Democratic congressman, referring to Legally Blonde: \u201cI saw that movie! Except Reese Witherspoon was actually smart.\u201d Asha Rangappa, CNN analyst: \u201cAll I have to say is that law schools don\u2019t have to report LSATs of transfer students which means that can take big risks... sometimes they just don\u2019t pan out.\u201d Norman Ornstein, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, author and journalist: \u201cJust like I thought I was being pranked when I was told that Jared Kushner had graduated from Harvard. Or when I was told that Donald Trump graduated from Wharton. I\u2019m beginning to question the accreditation of each of these entities.\u201d Here\u2019s David Smith\u2019s report from Washington, which includes this telling remark about the press secretary role from ABC News Chief White House correspondent Jon Karl: We\u2019ve had three White House press secretaries, we\u2019ve had \u2013 I guess depends on how you count \u2013 three or four communications directors in the Trump White House, but in reality we\u2019ve really only had one. \u201cDonald Trump has always been the press secretary, the spokesperson, the communications director for Donald Trump. That was true in 1994 when I first encountered him and it\u2019s absolutely true in 2020.\u201d And here\u2019s the whole of David\u2019s interview with Karl: The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani reports: Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, a Democrat from Michigan, has released a letter signed by 80 members of congress from 33 states urging political leaders to prioritize $47.5 billion in water funding as part of Phase 4 of the Covid-19 stimulus package. The lawmakers want $12.5 billion in emergency funds to cover the immediate cost of bills for low-income households, service restorations, and debt forgiveness. The money would be conditional on states, localities, and utilities suspending all water shutoffs, and agreeing to reconnect service to households previously been disconnected for unpaid bills. One in 20 households were disconnected in 2016. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the shocking fact that access to running water is not guaranteed in the US - the most powerful economy in the world. In fact, the Guardian has been reporting on how millions of Americans risk having their water shut off if they can\u2019t keep up with bill payments during the economic calamity triggered by the health crisis. Good hygiene, specifically regular hand washing, is recommended by the CDC and WHO as crucial to preventing the spread of the highly contagious virus. Today\u2019s letter, addressed to House and Senate leaders Nancy Pelosi, Mitchell McConnell, Chuck Schumer and Kevin McCarthy, says: \u201cHandwashing is our first line of defense against the spread of disease, and every person in our country needs access to running water to protect themselves, their families and their communities.\u201d The lawmakers - alongside 233 environmental, social justice and religious groups representing millions of Americans who\u2019ve written a separate letter - are also asking for $35bn in annual federal funding to improve water infrastructure across the country, which would tackle water contamination, leaks and create a million jobs. This is the second attempt to get federal money for water: the House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, but the clause was left out of the final legislation approved by the senate. According to a report from NBC News, members of a key White House coronavirus task force team which organises the purchase and distribution of equipment have been ordered to vacate their Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) \u201cwar room\u201d and, like most of the rest of the nation, work at home, after a \u201cpartner\u201d tested positive for Covid-19. Until further notice, all personnel in the Supply Chain Resilience task force\u2019 on a particular floor of one of Fema\u2019s buildings \u2018and the Fema Conference Center are required to telework\u2019, according to an email obtained by NBC News and confirmed by a Fema official. The message was sent to Fema headquarters staff at 11.17pm ET Monday. The \u2018Conference Center\u2019 is a war room set up in the Fema complex in Washington where Admiral John Polowczyk\u2019s supply chain unit, a sub-task force within Vice-President Mike Pence\u2019s larger task force that has gotten particular attention from presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, works to find and allocate personal protective equipment and other materials needed to combat the spread of coronavirus. Polowczyk and members of his unit were listed as recipients of the email. NBC\u2019s report goes on to say it is not immediately clear what effect WFH will have on the team, \u201cwhich has been highly visible thanks to Polowczyk\u2019s appearances at daily White House briefings\u201d. The team \u201chas also been highly controversial,\u201d NBC News says. One reason for that is the involvement of Kushner, who is simultaneously deeply engaged in President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. The task force has also drawn criticism for circumventing existing federal procedures and structures in ways that critics say have created delays, inefficiencies and cost increases in acquiring goods for the coronavirus fight. Here\u2019s our national affairs correspondent, Tom McCarthy, with a look at what it is Kushner is up to: And here, for good measure, is columnist Lloyd Green: Voting continues in Wisconsin today, a bizarre and alarming situation you can read more about here, in a report from our voting rights reporter Sam Levine: Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel files a very telling picture and accompanying reportage. It\u2019s live blog is here\u2026 Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York saw the biggest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll. The state has recorded 5,489 deaths linked to the virus, up from 4,758 a day earlier. New York accounts for about half of all coronavirus deaths in the US. The White House communications team has been overhauled. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who never held a single White House briefing, is being replaced by Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany. Trump has reportedly removed a Pentagon official tapped to oversee the coronavirus relief effort from his post. Acting Pentagon inspector general Glenn Fine was supposed to oversee implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus bill, but a Pentagon spokesperson confirmed he is no longer on the accountability committee. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump has reportedly removed a Pentagon offical who was supposed to oversee implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus bill from his post. Politico reports: A panel of inspectors general had named Glenn Fine \u2014 the acting Pentagon watchdog \u2014 to lead the group charged with monitoring the coronavirus relief effort. But Trump on Monday removed Fine from his post, instead naming the EPA inspector general to serve as the temporary Pentagon watchdog in addition to his other responsibilities. That decision, which began circulating on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning, effectively removed Fine from his role overseeing the coronavirus relief effort, since the new law permits only current inspectors general to fill the position. \u2018Mr. Fine is no longer on the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee,\u2019 Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s office, confirmed. The move comes just four days after Trump ousted Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community who designated the whistleblower complaint that kicked off the impeachment inquiry to be an \u201curgent concern.\u201d A billboard urging Iowa governor Kim Reynolds to implement a stay-at-home order will be circling the state capitol on a loop today, courtesy of a nationwide group of doctors. Iowa is one of eight states which has not instituted a statewide order, despite pleas from mayors across the state. The Committee to Protect Medicare, an organization of doctors which advocates for health care for all, has dispatched a billboard to Des Moines to pressure Reynolds into action. \u201cWe know that physical distancing is the number one thing we can do to limit the spread of the virus, limit the impact it has on individuals, but really limit the impact it has on hospitals in general so they don\u2019t get overwhelmed beyond their capacity,\u201d said Rob Davidson, a Michigan-based ER doctor and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that from the top of leadership statewide and nationally citizens understand the imperative to not be gathering in groups,\u201d Davidson said. The group is also calling for Donald Trump to instigate a nationwide shelter-in-place, something Trump has so far resisted. On Friday the Iowa Board of Medicine voted to recommend a stay-at-home order, while the Iowa Medical Society has made the same request. Reynolds has defended the lack of a ban, saying she had ordered schools and some businesses to close and asked people not to gather in groups of ten or more. On Tuesday she expanded the list of businesses which will be forced to close, adding malls, museums and outdoor and indoor playgrounds, but other businesses including golf courses are allowed to remain open. Iowa had 946 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Monday night, with 25 deaths. Republican senator Rand Paul is volunteering at a local hospital after recovering from coronavirus. The Kentucky senator, who has a medical degree from Duke University, was criticized for continuing to visit the Capitol as he awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Critics accused Paul of putting the health of lawmakers, staffers and other Capitol Hill employees at risk by not quarantining after he took the test. Paul defended his actions, saying it was his \u201cextra precaution\u201d of seeking a test even though he showed no symptoms that alerted colleagues to his diagnosis. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he would work to expand the $350 billion small business loan program created by the stimulus package. \u201cI will work with Secretary Mnuchin and Leader Schumer and hope to approve further funding for the Paycheck Protection Program by unanimous consent or voice vote during the next scheduled Senate session on Thursday,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. Senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this morning that $50 billion in loans have already been processed since the Paycheck Protection Program started accepting applications on Friday. But banks have reported a deluge of applications for the program, as small business owners fear the funding could run out if they do not get their application approved quickly. The proposed additional funds for the program, which could be as much as $200 billion, could help to stem some of that anxiety as the coronavirus pandemic leaves many businesses closed. Trump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany will become the new White House press secretary, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: Ms. McEnany has been a vocal defender of Mr. Trump on television, the main role the president has long believed the press secretary should play, according to current and former advisers. Her hiring is the first major personnel move by the incoming White House chief of staff, former Representative Mark Meadows of South Carolina. ... Also joining the White House press staff will be Alyssa Farah, a top spokeswoman at the Defense Department who once worked for Vice President Mike Pence, according to people briefed on the moves. Ms. Farah is close with Mr. Meadows, whose longtime congressional aide, Ben Williamson, will also join the communications team as an adviser. McEnany regularly defended Trump on television during the 2016 race and later joined his reelection campaign as national press secretary. Last month, McEnany incorrectly predicted that coronavirus would not affect Americans because of the president\u2019s steady leadership: New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s some of what he said: New York saw the biggest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll yesterday. New York has now lost 5,489 residents to coronavirus, up from 4,758 a day earlier. That figure represents about half of all coronavirus deaths across the United States. Cuomo said restarting the state\u2019s economy would depend on testing. The governor emphasized the state needs to scale up testing to help determine which residents have coronavirus antibodies and are unlikely to contract the virus again before the economy can restart. Cuomo asked all residents to continue respecting social distancing restrictions, as some residents start asking when normal life might be able to resume. \u201cI get it, but it\u2019s only been 37 days,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cOur behavior affects the number of cases.\u201d The Navy hospital ship Comfort will have 500 beds available for coronavirus patients. Cuomo called the president yesterday to ask him to allow the ship to start accepting coronavirus patients, a request that Trump granted. However, the shift to treating coronavirus patients means the ship will have to cut its number of hospital beds in half, from 1,000 to 500. Governor Andrew Cuomo urged New Yorkers to remember that each coronavirus death represents a human being who had a family. \u201cI guess one could get numb to the numbers,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cFor myself, I can tell you, the last thing I do is get numb.\u201d The governor noted mourning in the state is intensifying as the death toll rises. \u201cThe pain is increasing. The grief is increasing,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow you could get numb to any of this, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Cuomo said that he was proud of the work the state\u2019s healthcare system has done to save every possible person from dying of coronavirus. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis virus is very good at what it does, and it kills vulnerable people. ... We can\u2019t stop that. The question is, are you saving everyone you can save?\u201d The governor added, \u201cI don\u2019t see the numbness, and I don\u2019t think New Yorkers see the numbness.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo applauded the work of medical professionals as the state grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWhat they have done is incredible, just incredible,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor also thanked other essential workers, such as transit employees, who have continued to report to work. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re exposing themselves to, and they still do it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cGod bless them.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said residents must avoid holding large funerals as the state\u2019s coroanvirus death toll rises. \u201cThese social distancing regulations are not just \u2018please.\u2019 They\u2019re regulations,\u201d said Cuomo, who doubled the fine for violating the \u201cstay at home\u201d order yesterday. \u201cNow is not the time for large religious gatherings,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou do no one a service by making this worse and infecting more people.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he understood the frustration of residents who are asking when social distancing might come to an end. \u201cThis is like Groundhog Day living through this bizarre reality that we\u2019re in,\u201d Cuomo said. But the governor emphasized residents will need to continue to be patient in order to protect their loved ones and neighbors from contracting the virus. \u201cI get it, but it\u2019s only been 37 days,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cOur behavior affects the number of cases.\u201d Cuomo also noted the 1918 flu epidemic peaked in New York for six months, killing 30,000 of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cSocial distancing is working,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI know that it\u2019s hard, but we have to keep doing it.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said officials would look ahead to restarting the economy, but the governor noted the state is not there yet because coronavirus deaths are still happening at a high rate. Cuomo said the determination of when and how to restart the economy would depend on testing, particularly testing to confirm if people have coronavirus antibodies in their system and are likely immune to the virus. The governor said New York would need to scale up its testing capacity to test a large number of residents and announced the state would invest in testing companies working to expand capacity. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the capacity of the Navy hospital ship Comfort would decrease now that it is going to start accepting coronavirus patients. Cuomo asked Trump yesterday to allow the Comfort to start taking coronavirus patients to provide some relief to overwhelmed emergency rooms in New York, a request that the president granted. But Cuomo said the number of hospital beds on the Comfort would decrease from 1,000 to 500 now that the ship will be treating coronavirus patients. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. The governor noted the three-day average of hospitalizations is down, indicating the state is \u201creaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations.\u201d But the New York death toll continues to steeply rise. The state has now recorded 5,489 deaths, up from 4,758 a day earlier. Those 731 deaths represent the highest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis started. New York also still has the highest number of cases of any US state, with 138,836 cases of coronavirus already confirmed. Joe Biden said he would like Bernie Sanders to be \u201cpart of the journey,\u201d although not his running mate, if he wins the Democratic nomination. Biden has a significant lead in the delegate count, but Sanders remains in the race, despite an increasingly narrow path to the nomination. Asked whether Sanders should drop out, Biden told the \u201cToday\u201d show, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t presume to do that. ... It\u2019s a hard, hard decision and Bernie has a lot of really devoted followers. It\u2019s a difficult decision to make. But it\u2019s his to make. I\u2019m not going to suggest what he should do.\u201d Biden made clear that if he wins the nomination, he would seek Sanders\u2019 input on the issues that fueled the progressive senator\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf I\u2019m the nominee I can tell you one thing: I would very much want Bernie to be part of the journey, not as a vice presidential nominee but just engaging in all the things that he\u2019s worked so hard to do, many of which I agree with,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president applauded Sanders for his \u201cincredible following,\u201d as the frontrunner tries to convince his rival\u2019s supporters to back him in the general election. Biden also said he did not think the November election should be delayed or postponed because of coroanvirus, even as today\u2019s rocky primary in Wisconsin raises questions about how to safely conduct in-person voting amid a pandemic. The White House has confirmed Stephanie Grisham is leaving her role as press secretary to rejoin the first lady\u2019s team. \u201cMy replacements will be announced in the coming days and I will stay in the West Wing to help with a smooth transition for as long as needed,\u201d Grisham said in a statement released by the White House. Grisham served as both press secretary and communications director in the Trump White House, so it appears two people may be taking on those roles now. Grisham will serve as the first lady\u2019s chief of staff and spokesperson. The White House statement noted that Melania Trump\u2019s previous chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, resigned earlier this week to spend time with family. Wisconsin\u2019s lieutenant governor predicted the state\u2019s presidential primary today would be a \u201cShit Show.\u201d The Democratic official\u2019s tweet comes a day after the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked governor Tony Evers\u2019 executive order to cancel in-person voting out of concern about spreading coronavirus. The number of polling sites across the state has nosedived because so many poll workers have quit, and voters are already reporting long lines as they try to cast their ballots. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary who has not yet held a briefing, is reportedly leaving her role after about nine months. CNN reports: [Grisham] is returning to the East Wing as first lady Melania Trump\u2019s chief of staff as President Donald Trump\u2019s new chief of staff Mark Meadows shakes up the communications team in the West Wing. Meadows is currently considering several candidates for the press secretary job, including Trump campaign spokesman Kayleigh McEnany. The new chief of staff is also considering hiring Alyssa Farah, the current spokeswoman for the Defense Department, for a communications role, among others, two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Grisham was frequently criticized for refusing to hold White House briefings, which were a daily feature of past administrations but started becoming less and less frequent under Graham\u2019s predecessor, Sarah Sanders. Surgeon general Jerome Adams said he \u201cnever saw\u201d a Jan. 29 memo from Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, warning the coronavirus outbreak could become a pandemic. Adams defended the White House\u2019s response to the pandemic, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for decades that this is a possibility. ... Many people at all levels just did not expect something like this to happen at this magnitude.\u201d When NBC News\u2019 Savannah Guthrie pressed him on that last point, saying the memo proved some White House advisers were aware of how bad this situation could get, Adams said, \u201cThere were preparations going on the entire time.\u201d Trump has been repeatedly criticized for incorrectly predicting coronavirus would miraculously \u201cdisappear\u201d without affecting many Americans, and reports of Navarro\u2019s memo have intensified accusations that the president mishandled the government\u2019s early response. Lines are already long at polling places in Wisconsin, with voters saying they are preparing to wait for hours to cast their ballots. So many poll workers have quit over concerns about coronvairus that only five polling sites are open today in Milwaukee, down from 180. The confusion and expected drop in turnout in Wisconsin have raised serious concerns about the November general election, particularly if coronavirus makes a return at the end of the year, as many experts have predicted. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights icon, endorsed former vice president Joe Biden for president on Tuesday morning. \u201cI\u2019m delighted, very pleased, very happy, and very honored to take the time to endorse a friend, a man of courage, a man of conscience as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States,\u201d Lewis said of backing Biden during a call with reporters. \u201cIt is my belief that we need Joe Biden now more than ever before.\u201d Lewis\u2019s endorsement comes as most Democratic lawmakers and the majority of the party\u2019s voters fall in line behind Biden. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is still running against Biden in the Democratic primary, but his path is increasingly narrow. Lewis, in endorsing Biden, urged him to pick a woman as his running mate if the former vice president wins the nomination. \u201cIt would be a good to have a woman of color,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt would be good to have a woman who looks like the rest of America - smart, gifted, a fighter, a warrior and we have plenty of able women. Some are black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I think the time is long past for making the White House look like the whole of America.\u201d During a recent debate Biden said if elected president, he would nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court and would pick a woman as his running mate. Other influential lawmakers, including South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, have said that Biden should pick a woman of color as his running mate. In an interview with the Financial Times Clyburn name checked California senator Kamala Harris and former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice (which he called a \u201csleeper\u201d) as possible running mates for Biden. George Conway, a Trump critic who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, offered his take on the president and his team amid the pandemic. \u201cHe\u2019s 100% insane, and nobody in the administration has the balls to tell him that,\u201d Conway said of Trump and his advisers. Conway\u2019s jab follows reports that one of Trump\u2019s top advisers warned the president of the coronavirus outbreak potentially evolving into a pandemic in late January. Conway has become a vocal critic of the president, even though his wife worked on Trump\u2019s campaign and has been with the administration since his inaugruation. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Pengelly. As Sam Levine reported, thousands of Wisconsin voters are likely to be disenfranchised today after the Democratic governor\u2019s effort to cancel in-person voting failed. Because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, more than 100 jurisdictions in Wisconsin reported last week that they don\u2019t have enough poll workers to staff even one voting place, and Milwaukee\u2019s number of polling sites is down from 180 to five. A photo from one of those five Milwaukee polling sites showed voters wearing masks and trying to socially distance as they waited to cast their ballots: Here\u2019s a report from Sam Levine, our voting rights reporter, on a dramatic and bizarre day in Wisconsin yesterday and what\u2019s to come today: Wisconsin voters are heading to the polls on Tuesday, to cast ballots amid a global pandemic after a stunning 24-hour period in which the state\u2019s governor tried to cancel in-person voting because of the public health risk, only to be overruled by the state supreme court. The US supreme court also weighed in, hours before the polls opened. Even though the Democratic primary between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders is winding down, Wisconsin has exploded in controversy. It is both the most significant battle so far between Republicans and Democrats over the right to vote in 2020 and a chaotic scramble to protect both the vote and public health. In late March, Democratic governor Tony Evers issued an executive order instructing people to stay at home. There is such a severe shortage of poll workers that Evers asked the national guard to step in. The Wisconsin Elections Commission has declined to project turnout, but it is expected to be low. Democrats say Republicans are banking on low turnout to help Daniel Kelly, a conservative on the state supreme court, hold his seat. On Monday, after weeks of rebuffing efforts to delay the election, Evers issued an executive order seeking to delay in-person voting until 9 June. Republicans, who have resisted calls to mail a ballot to every voter and ease restrictions on mail-in voting, challenged the order in the state supreme court, where conservatives hold a majority. The court overruled Evers. Kelly recused himself. The US supreme court weighed in, upholding a lower court order extending the deadline by which mail-in ballots could be received from 7 April to 13 April. But in a 5-4 decision, the high court accepted a request from Republicans to require ballots to be postmarked by election day. That rule is likely to disenfranchise thousands of voters who have not yet received ballots even though they requested them by the official deadline, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the four liberal justices who dissented. Oddly enough, Donald Trump has a recommendation for Wisconsin conservatives: Here\u2019s more key reading from Sam, on Wisconsin and threats to the right to vote: Here\u2019s a tweet thread that Donald Trump may not like too much. It\u2019s about Gretchen Whitmer, Democratic governor of Michigan, a state in which more than 17,000 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed and 727 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins figures. Trump\u2019s distaste for Whitmer is well-known \u2013 he called her \u201cthat woman from Michigan\u201d at one White House briefing. Detroit journalist Chad Livengood is following her interview on 1320 WILS-AM, \u201cLansing\u2019s More Compelling Talk Radio\u201d. It\u2019s fascinating reading. \u201cWhitmer cites [University of Michigan] modeling that Michigan\u2019s coronavirus outbreak won\u2019t peak until late April,\u201d Livengood writes. \u201cShe was asked about what plans there are to restart the economy: \u2018It is too early to start implementing anything. We know yesterday we had 110 Michiganders lose their battle with Covid-19.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump was warned at the end of January by one of his top White House advisers that coronavirus had the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and derail the US economy, unless tough action were taken immediately, new memos have revealed. The memos were written by Trump\u2019s economic adviser Peter Navarro and circulated via the National Security Council widely around the White House and federal agencies. They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing loudly by late January, at a time when the president was consistently downplaying the threat of Covid-19. The memos, first reported by the New York Times and Axios, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans. According to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d The second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2m Americans and infect as many as 100m. This was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly. Senior scientists, epidemiologists, and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that message clearly early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of seasonal flu. But the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on multiple occasions \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease. As the pandemic has swept across the country, the president has come under mounting criticism for having done too little, too late in response, leading to mass shortages of diagnostic testing, protective gear for frontline health workers and ventilators for the very sick. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Figures, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, first: Cases confirmed: 368,036 Deaths: 10,982 Cases in New York, the worst-hit state: 131,815 Deaths in New York: 4,758 Other states are struggling too, of course: there have been more than 1,000 deaths in New Jersey and Michigan, California and Louisiana are also particularly hard hit. And case and death numbers will no doubt increase today. There are all sorts of news lines out there of course, perhaps the biggest being British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s admission to intensive care. Here\u2019s the latest report from our London office. And here\u2019s the UK live blog with constant updates. In the US, Julia Carrie Wong has an in-depth look at Donald Trump\u2019s support for hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19 but which the president wants Americans to take: The president pushed the drug again at his White House briefing on Monday, a briefing which was also, by the by, attended by Chanel Rion, a correspondent from One America News Network whose presence at briefings and leading questions to Trump have caused consternation in the mainstream media. Here\u2019s Adrian Horton\u2019s write-up of what John Oliver had to say about that and OAN in general on Sunday night.
