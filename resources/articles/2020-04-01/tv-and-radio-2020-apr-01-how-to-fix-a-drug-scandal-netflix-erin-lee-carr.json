A drug chemist in a lab at Amherst, Massachusetts, one of the state\u2019s two main drug testing facilities, Farak was responsible for testing evidence obtained by police. Her certified assessment of the content and amount secured thousands of drug convictions for the state, and she routinely appeared in court to affirm them; without a chemist\u2019s signature proving an illegal substance, the charges of possession could not stand. Usually, this process was unremarkable, occurring off-stage, but Farak\u2019s arrest on 19 January 2013 for drug theft and evidence tampering raised an alarming possibility: if she was high while at work, her tests could be thrown out, and the convictions overturned. Farak had worked at the lab for nearly a decade, contributing to thousands of prison sentences. How long had this been going on? The arrest of the then 35-year-old Farak, depicted in the opening scenes of Netflix\u2019s documentary series How to Fix a Drug Scandal, shocked a Massachusetts criminal justice system already reeling from another drug chemist scandal. Just six months earlier, in August 2012, Annie Dookhan, a chemist at the Hinton Labs in Boston, was caught forging tens of thousands of tests in order to win over her superiors and prosecutors as a star employee; her arrest immediately threw thousands of convictions into legal limbo. Dookhan and Farak didn\u2019t know each other, and worked at opposite ends of the state, but their collective actions exposed a badly neglected system designed to streamline the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, in which the actions of one unreliable actor resounded powerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer ripple effect,\u201d Erin Lee Carr, who directed all four episodes of the series, said to the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about 10 cases, we\u2019re not talking about a thousand cases. We\u2019re talking upwards of 20,000 cases that were impacted by two chemists.\u201d It was an unprecedented nightmare for Massachusetts, one How to Fix a Drug Scandal dissects in suspenseful yet compassionate fashion over the course of four hours, with first-person interviews from criminal defense lawyers who fought to secure release for clients convicted with faulty evidence, state prosecutors, journalists and members of Farak\u2019s family. (Farak, now out of prison, spoke with Carr off-the-record, but declined an on-the-record interview due to an ongoing civil case.) The series also delves into a second, more insidious layer of scandal: the state attorney general office\u2019s efforts to downplay Farak\u2019s liability to past convictions. Whereas Dookhan\u2019s arrest jammed court dockets with thousands of appeals and overturned numerous faulty convictions, there was near silence after Farak\u2019s arrest, as the state attorney general\u2019s office buried evidence of Farak\u2019s longstanding drug addiction, blocked legal attempts to view evidence, lied to district attorneys and misled two circuit court judges \u2013 a five-year attempt to keep defendants from questioning their convictions that one judge called \u201ca fraud upon the court\u201d. Carr first heard of the Dookhan scandal incidentally, during interviews for her film I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth vs Michelle Carter, about another sensational Massachusetts trial, in 2016. Shortly afterward, she met journalist Paul Solotaroff, who was writing a feature on the attorney general office\u2019s misconduct and introduced her to the Farak case. Carr was familiar with the plea deal system in the US, which coerces drug defendants into plea-bargained sentences, lest they risk trial, and thus a harsher sentence. But she didn\u2019t understand how integral crime labs were to drug convictions, or the role of criminal defendants. Enter Luke Ryan, an amiable and dogged defense attorney from western Massachusetts who serves as How to Fix a Drug Scandal\u2019s guide through the thicket of appeals after Farak\u2019s arrest. Ryan pestered for years to get access to the attorney general\u2019s files, which confirmed his suspicion \u2013 one an actor retells in a recreation of Farak\u2019s grand jury testimony in the series \u2013 that Farak was using long before the incident leading to her arrest. \u201cI think a lot of people, when they encounter these cases, they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you know, the people had drugs, and they\u2019re guilty,\u2019\u201d Carr said. \u201cAnd I say back to you: imagine spending a couple years in prison based on faulty evidence, and see if you feel the same way.\u201d It\u2019s not just the sentences hinging on accurate drug evidence tests; it\u2019s the challenges of life post-incarceration, in which life-building steps such as getting a job or finding adequate housing are jeopardized by a drug conviction. \u201cIt does not stop the day you get out of prison,\u201d said Carr. To that end, How to Fix a Drug Scandal features two of Ryan\u2019s clients, including Rafael Rodriguez, who struggled with drug addiction and was convicted based on a sample certified by Farak. Ryan tried for years to secure Rodriguez\u2019s freedom, which resulted in years of legal limbo and merry-go-round of prison stays which exacted a heavy toll. Rafael\u2019s children and wife recall a goofy, kind-hearted man, one evidenced in old cellphone footage, hamming for the camera. But the conviction, which a judge kept based on the attorney general office\u2019s withheld evidence, prevented him from moving forward. While the series delves into the impact of mishandled evidence and, more pressingly, the state\u2019s unrepentant \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, Carr also provides space for the motivations of Dookhan, a first-generation striver validated for her \u201cproductivity\u201d and helpfulness, and especially Farak. Farak\u2019s sister and mother explain her longstanding battle with depression and feelings of invisibility, which in part fueled her drug use. Offering context for their thought processes was \u201ca product of my sobriety\u201d, said Carr, who has been public with her own struggles with addiction. \u201cIn my program, you are not equal to your worst actions. It\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d Carr\u2019s father, David Carr, was a storied cultural critic at the New York Times whose memoir The Night of The Gun details his own addiction to cocaine and alcohol. \u201cI\u2019ve always encountered true crime and criminal justice reporting from a place of radical empathy,\u201d said Carr, though she added: \u201cI want to be clear: addiction explains everything and excuses nothing.\u201d Still, How to Fix a Drug Scandal outlines a much larger picture: how one addict\u2019s actions crystallizes the arbitrariness of criminalizing addiction, how two chemists are not isolated bad apples, but symptoms of a rotten system which, of course, disproportionately and expeditiously convicts people of color. \u201cThese types of things only flourish when people assist in them,\u201d Carr said. Boston\u2019s Hinton Labs, now shut down, incentivized productivity and supportive relationships with prosecutors. \u201cShe was going through three, four, five times the number of cases that other chemists were \u2013 that was not normal, and it was OKed because there was such an incredible backlog in cases that they needed to get through it,\u201d said Carr. In Farak\u2019s case, the Amherst lab was so underfunded, understaffed and overburdened that her drug use went unnoticed for a whole decade. \u201cI think the system needed to be brought to task,\u201d said Carr. The Hinton Lab is now closed, Amherst lab shuttered, but the vulnerabilities of little-seen yet consequential drug labs aren\u2019t specific to Massachusetts. \u201cThis is a product of the war on drugs done on the cheap,\u201d said Carr. \u201cAnd we will continue to see cases like this if we don\u2019t really take a good, hard look at drug labs and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d How to Fix a Drug Scandal is now available on Netflix"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
