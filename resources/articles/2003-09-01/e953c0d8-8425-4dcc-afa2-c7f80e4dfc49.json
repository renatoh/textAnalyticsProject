A mere 16 days into his fast, the boxed illusionist seems to be making everyone - from drunks to Guardian columnists - feel just a little exposed. Having an American over-confident, over-hyped and overhead is more, apparently, than many of us can bear. As a result the most interesting spectacle on the South Bank is not the man in the Perspex cage but the crowd he attracts - yesterday alone more than 10,000. It took only a fortnight of Blaine's diet to induce our own most 'down-to-earth' champion to challenge the dangling man's right to the front pages. Sir Paul McCartney's impromptu piece of performance art after a long dinner on Thursday evening seemed to uncork long suppressed demons. Maybe to McCartney it felt like only yesterday that John and Yoko were up to this kind of thing, making a show of themselves behind the glass of a shop window. Having been upstaged once, the second Beatle, ever conscious of his billing, was, you imagine, determined not to let it happen again. And Macca is not the only one whose neuroses have been made transparent by Blaine's stunt. By sitting in his box the American offers a little window on us all. Much of what is revealed confirms what we have always suspected: that there is nothing a nation of cynics is more threatened by than to feel it is being had; that we could happily talk about other people's digestive systems for ever; and that when more than three or four of us are gathered together at least a couple will feel moved to throw things. (Last week it was eggs, this weekend chipolatas were threatened. If Blaine makes it through the next few weeks he may eventually have assembled the ultimate symbol of our hospitality, a full English breakfast). Like the crowds outside the Big Brother house, conspicuously for or against the evictee, what we seem most at pains to do in all of this is to have the self-contained individual made part of our crowd, to have him say something about us. It would be wonderful to believe that Blaine himself is in fact just along the river at Hay's Galleria, ordering an overpriced burger, drinking a pint and listening to the British debating what the chap in the box means. If his act is really just smoke and mirrors, though, the latter are already pointing in our direction. Long may he hang."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
