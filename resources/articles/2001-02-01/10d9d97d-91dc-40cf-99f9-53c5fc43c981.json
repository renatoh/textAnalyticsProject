One is Lyon striker and captain Sonny Anderson, who took the teenage Thierry Henry under his wing as one of Wenger's last signings when he was in charge of Monaco. The other is Jose Gomes De Moraes Edmilson, the elegant international centre-back who may cause him no end of regret at the Stade Gerland, which was sold out long ago. The last time Wenger saw Edmilson was in Sao Paolo last year, when he watched him before trying to sign him. Edmilson, 24, talked at the Lyon training ground about the meeting that could so easily have made him a defensive team-mate of his friend Silvinho. He said: 'I was so excited about the chance of joining Arsenal. I had a good game in the match Ars\u00e9ne Wenger watched. He sat down with me after wards and told me how much he wanted me to come and play for him.' The deal fell through because the Brazilian could not get a European passport in time - a contentious subject right now. He eventually got one through having an Italian great, great grandfather. 'It was a big disappointment for me when the deal was called off,' said Edmilson. 'Winning my first cap for Brazil a few days later helped make up for it.' Lyon, who have won nothing since landing the French Cup in 1973, should be dazzled by the Arsenal trophy room, but, backed by the wealth of TV giants Path\u00e9, they have emerged as title contenders. They are only two points off the top of a French championship they have never won - though Jean Tigana coached them to runners-up spot in 1995 - and, in Anderson and Edmilson, they possess key elements of world class. Anderson, briefly with Barcelona and scorer of 102 League goals in some 150 games for Marseille, Monaco and Lyon, is looking forward to seeing his old friend Henry. 'Thierry was a phenomenon at just 17 with Monaco. We played three years together with him mostly on the left flank. We hit it off straightaway. He frequently came round to our house where my wife would cook something up for us. We ate a lot of pancakes together. 'Thierry had a few problems at the time. Everyone was calling him the new Ronaldo and wanted a part of him. I had more experience at 25 and tried to get him to concentrate only on his game. Now everyone wants to play like Thierry Henry.' Anderson has devastating close control and, at 30, retains his speed. He has also found an ideal partner this season in 27-year-old Steve Marlet, signed from Auxerre. Marlet, who has scored five goals in the Champions League, said, 'This is our big chance. We are unbeaten this year and go into the tie with a lot of confidence.' Another intriguing character for Arsenal to confront is Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9, formerly of West Ham. Fo\u00e9, who patrols in front of the Lyon back four, admits his spell in English football may have toughened him up, but is now causing him problems with French referees. He said: 'I have been sent off twice and booked a few times since I came to Lyon at the start of the season. It is all down to what I learned in English football. I am getting into trouble for things English referees would consider normal play. It is affecting my game. 'They thought I was too nice at first in England. Now they think I am too nasty in France. I am trying to forget what I was taught while with West Ham. I did love it there, but they needed the money and I wanted a club with a shot at the Champions League.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
