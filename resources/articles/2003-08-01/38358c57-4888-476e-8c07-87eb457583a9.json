When given his head for his country last night, he lost it yet again. The 20-year-old was dismissed after appearing to aim a punch at Mario Carevic after the hour, a move that must have left his coach David Platt wondering why he had bothered to give him a reprieve. And just to make it more painful, Croatia swept down the pitch in injury time and Goran Ljubovjevic back-heeled a pass to Daniel Pranjic who lobbed an exquisite third over a defender and into the net. Perhaps the expectation weighed too heavily on young shoulders as England were undone in the early exchanges, a fact that will unsettle Platt with only 17 days before their crucial home match against Portugal. Jermain Defoe's usual clinical finishing escaped him as he sent a shot wide after Francis Jeffers' threaded through ball had put given him a one-on-one with the goalkeeper Tomislav Vranjic. Those hesitations would inevitably tell and England were soon behind. Glen Johnson was dispossessed on the edge of the centre circle and Dino Drpic lost no time in freeing the imposing Goran Ljubojevic, whose controlled first touch gave him time to rifle the ball beyond Murray in England's goal. England could, and should, have levelled. Firstly Paul Konchesky delivered a skipping cross that eluded everyone in the defence before finding Jermaine Pennant at the far post, but he found the angle too tight to convert. Then Jeffers missed England's simplest chance, sending Gareth Barry's knock-down header straight at the goalkeeper from only five yards. There could have been more red faces in the England dressing room at half-time had Murray not been alert to Johnson's attempted clearance that was heading for the net before the goalkeeper's neat tip-over. Ljubojevic has quick reflexes to add to his obvious pace and power and put them to good effect shortly after the interval. The substitute Dario Zahora flicked Mario Carevic's cross into a crowd of English defenders in the six-yard box but it was the Osijek striker who reacted first to drive the ball home. Soon the increasingly confident Croatians were trying tricks. Awarded a free-kick on the halfway line, Mario Lucic's looping shot from the dead ball tested the back-pedalling Murray. But even that was overshadowed by Pennant's off-the-ball stupidity. Rather than ignore a weak push from Niko Kranjcar, the 20-year-old winger struck back, appearing to punch the Croatian in the face. The Norwegian referee had no option but to send off the Arsenal reserve and deal a heavy blow to England's European Championship qualification prospects.
