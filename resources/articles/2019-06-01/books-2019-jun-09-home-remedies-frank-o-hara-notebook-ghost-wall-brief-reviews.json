Their author, China-born and California-raised, confidently straddles multiple cultural divides to conjure up a succession of memorable characters, from the spoilt Beijing hipster shirking parental expectations to the country bumpkin catapulted into a life of American riches. Often, a story\u2019s ending will bound tantalisingly into the future, scattering indelible phrases in its wake, as when a tiger stands in the night to face a boy \u201clike a brush lifting out of the ink\u201d. Striking, soulful and ablaze with promise. A Frank O\u2019Hara Notebook Bill Berkson No place press, \u00a335, 278pp Having only met Frank O\u2019Hara on the page, the late poet and art critic Berkson was inspired enough to dedicate two poems to him. When they actually met, in 1960, he knew he\u2019d found both a friend and a mentor. For years after O\u2019Hara\u2019s untimely death in 1966, Berkson planned to write a study of him, but he died with the project incomplete. This is a facsimile of Berkson\u2019s notebook \u2013 vignettes, observations and pithy quotes, along with glimpses of jazzy parties and artistic glamour. Inventive and idiosyncratic, it\u2019s a sublimely apt ode to O\u2019Hara, as well as to the poetry and art scenes of 60s New York. Ghost Wall Sarah Moss Granta, \u00a38.99, 160pp The exhilarating originality of Moss\u2019s sixth novel makes it impossible to resist, despite a sinister denouement that\u2019s foreshadowed from the beginning. It\u2019s set on the Northumbrian moors, where a group of archaeology students and their professor set up camp, intent on living like iron-age Britons. Smart, cowed Silvie, 17, is dragged along by her father, a local bus driver with an obsessive interest in the past. As this tale of love and sacrifice runs its course, themes ranging from class to xenophobia are underpinned by a fierce sense of place and precise, poetic prose. \u2022 To order Home Remedies or Ghost Wall, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
