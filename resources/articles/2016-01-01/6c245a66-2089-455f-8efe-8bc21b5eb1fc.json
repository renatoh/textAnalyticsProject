But the president\u2019s successful bailout of American carmakers and the subsequent revival of Michigan\u2019s most important industry was eclipsed by a nearby civic emergency: a water crisis in Flint that has threatened the health of tens of thousands of people. Sixty-eight miles north by road, thousands of residents of the long-neglected industrial town have been poisoned by lead-contaminated water, the consequence of tight-fisted city authorities who switched the source of the city\u2019s drinking water from Detroit to the Flint river in April 2014. The river water corroded the city\u2019s ageing service lines, which leached dangerously high amounts of lead into Flint\u2019s drinking water and poisoned thousands of children. It was the risk to the city\u2019s children that moved Obama to mention Flint\u2019s emergency in his remarks. \u201cIf I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids\u2019 health could be at risk,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why over the weekend I declared a federal emergency in Flint to send more resources on top of what we\u2019ve already put on the ground.\u201d \u201cI met with Mayor [Karen] Weaver in the White House, in the Oval Office,\u201d Obama continued, \u201cand told her that we are gonna have her back, and all the people of Flint\u2019s back as they work their way through this terrible tragedy.\u201d Obama\u2019s pledge rolled into motion on Saturday, when the president signed an emergency declaration authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to provide bottled water, filters and testing supplies for 90 days. The funds come in response to a request from Republican governor Rick Snyder, who has faced calls for his resignation in response to his handling of the crisis. The famously parsimonious Snyder asked Obama for federal assistance on Friday, saying emergency measures could cost the state $41m. Snyder, who appointed the emergency managers responsible for changing the source of Flint\u2019s drinking water, waited more than a week after a state of public emergency had been declared in October 2015 to acknowledge that mistakes had been made. Officials at Michigan\u2019s department of environmental quality, headed by more Snyder appointees, downplayed concerns from Flint citizens that the city\u2019s water had a foul taste and an orange hue, continuing to insist that Flint\u2019s water was safe to drink. During Snyder\u2019s state of the state address on Tuesday, the governor announced that he would release all official emails related Flint\u2019s water crisis the following day. \u201cWe will not stop working for the people of Flint until every person has clean water, every single day, no matter what,\u201d the governor said. It\u2019s an extraordinary measure in Michigan, one of only two states in the US where the governor\u2019s office is exempted from the Freedom of Information Act. The 274-page set of email correspondence released by Snyder\u2019s office purports to cover the entirety of the Flint water crisis, from January 2014 to December 2015. Snyder, in a statement accompanying the email release, said that the release was \u201cin the spirit of transparency and accountability\u201d. Much of the release is bulked with lengthy reports, advisory leaflets and council minutes pertaining to the town\u2019s switch from Detroit water to Flint river water. The first two pages, which constitute a 3 January 2014 email, are entirely redacted except for the message header, which is attributed to attorney-client privilege. Snyder\u2019s input is often brief. \u201cPlease proceed as recommended,\u201d is his reply to a lengthy set of revisions to a press release on 3 December 2015. Obama cited Flint\u2019s water crisis as an example of why the government\u2019s role in public safety is so crucial. \u201cIt is a reminder of why you can\u2019t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we, together, provide as a government\u201d to assure the health and safety of the American public is preserved, Obama said. Although Flint\u2019s water was reconnected to Detroit\u2019s supply following the declaration of a state of emergency in October, it\u2019s little consolation for the people of Flint. The city\u2019s service lines are hopelessly corroded, tainting the new water supply with lead concentrations far above federal action levels. At the state of the state address, roughly 350 protesters chanted \u201cclean water is a right, not just for the rich and white\u201d and \u201cFlint lives matter\u201d as they called for Snyder\u2019s resignation and arrest. Flint resident Richard Vasquez told the Guardian that his water has been tainted for months, and that despite the dangerous concentration of lead, he had still been expected to pay exorbitant utility bills for undrinkable water. \u201cWe are not a third world. This is America, this should not happen here,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have people from all over the city and world here, supporting Flint. Because it can happen to you, it can happen in your city.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
