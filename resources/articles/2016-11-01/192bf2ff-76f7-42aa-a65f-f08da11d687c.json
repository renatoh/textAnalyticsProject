The Australian dollar rose from lows of about US75.85 cents to about US77 cents, and was at US76.55 cents at the US close. The Australian market was up about 147 points at the beginning of trade. The Australian share market lost about $34bn in value on Wednesday as the election counts came in. Despite an upheaval that saw the the stock market slump by almost 4%, it recovered to finish just 1.9% lower. Juliana Roadley, a market analyst at CommSec, said: \u201cUnfortunately, we were opening as polls were closing so we felt the brunt of the volatility in the market. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen overnight is a bit more calm coming back into the markets.\u201d In a statement on Thursday morning CommSec said global oil prices had rebounded from lows as equities markets rose on the expectation of greater US public spending. \u201cIn Asian trade, futures markets had suggested an 800-point fall by the Dow Jones index at the open of trade,\u201d it said. \u201cIndustrials rose on expectations for increased infrastructure spending. Pharmaceutical stocks rose on expectations of a stable regulatory environment.\u201d Marcus Padley, the director of financial services company MTIS and the author of stock market newsletter Marcus Today, told ABC News 24 on Thursday morning that international recognition of the Trump presidency could be the reason global markets had bounced back. \u201cThe moment he has got in, all that campaigning staff has started to evaporate and he has started to build credibility,\u201d Padley said. \u201cHis own speech was almost presidential. Then you have Obama and Clinton filing in behind him. All the international leaders have filed in behind him with shows of support. You even had an open letter from 1,100 large companies including people like Boeing saying they would work with the administration. \u201cEverybody wants him to succeed. I think his maverick personality won\u2019t be allowed to dominate policy. I think the markets have come back because they\u2019ve realised, actually, in the same way as Ronald Reagan was an entirely inappropriate-looking appointment, Arnold Schwarzenegger as well \u2013 it is a show. \u201cTrump\u2019s in. He is not stupid. He is a businessman.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
