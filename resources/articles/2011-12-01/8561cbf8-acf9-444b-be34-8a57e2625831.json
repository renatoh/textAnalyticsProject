That's the problem. Don't know when we're well off. For example, Richard Desmond launches a Health Lottery. It's nowhere near as good as the National Lottery. Much less goes to charities. But he did it. That's something. But the public can be difficult. Ungrateful. Thus, it does appear that sales of the Health Lottery have so far been lacklustre. How so? Well, certainly enough to impact on the pay of long-suffering staff at the Daily and Sunday Express. \"We were informed,\" says a union bulletin to staff, \"that there was to be no pay rise for January and that further negotiations were being postponed until March. The reasons given were the poor economic climate and the relatively disappointing sales of Health Lottery tickets.\" Des will be upset by this turn of events. The staff more so. \u2022 Mixed fortunes meanwhile at London's City Hall, where the mayor, Boris Johnson, has known joy and heartbreak in a single week. The joy of his new bus for London unveiled; the pain of seeing it broken down after a disastrous trip on to a motorway. There have been other irritants too, chief among them the author Sonia Purnell, whose biography Just Boris did so much to reawaken interest in his libidinous activities. Choice phrases are said to have been overheard in the environs of his office. But there's good news too, because rival biographer Andrew Gimson is also on hand and his reflections don't cause anything like the same level of consternation. He had a page in Tuesday's Evening Standard. By contrast, say troubled scribblers there, the troublesome Purnell can't get a look-in. \u2022 There's a small but dedicated group of North Korea fans in the UK but still the public displays of grief at the departure of Kim Jong-il have been muted. The Morning Star responded with just a factual report while neither the Stalin Society or New Worker website had much to say. More surprisingly, neither did the British-Korean Friendship Society. Such is the weight of grief. More promisingly, the new Dear Leader is on Twitter (@leaderkimjongun) which shows a welcome commitment to engagement. He confirms the suspicion that his late father was an Arsenal fan. Neither has enjoyed the best year. \u2022 Proof now that the politics of principle are alive and living in Norfolk. On 11 November Phil Hardy, leader of the Green party county councillors, noted the defection of two rivals to the Conservatives. This very much displeased him. \"Cllr Paul Rice's defection from the Lib Dems to the Tories only a few months ago was the first one in Norfolk since the 1970s. Now David Callaby has defected so soon after,\" said this Mandela of the Fens. \"This is a clear indication of how close the Liberal Democrats are with the Tories, not just with the coalition government but here in Norfolk too. People in Lakenham need to be aware of this when they decide how to vote in the byelection on 24 November.\" BBC Online, one month later: \"Green leader at Norfolk county council joins Tories.\" Nice one, Phil. \u2022 And is there truth in panto? This is Buttons to the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella at the Richmond Theatre. \"You're just like Cameron and Clegg, you two,\" roars Buttons. \"Found everywhere and wanted nowhere.\" \u2022 Finally, for one leading personality in the troubled eurozone, this winter is as cheerful as any. The downturn does nothing to distress Father Christmas. His Lapland abode is snow-clad Rovaniemi, where the shopping mall, Santa Claus Village, continues to do a roaring trade in such luxury goods as reindeer furs and Finnish vodka. Even the investors' flight towards gold, now at $1,694 per ounce, is good for him, as Lapland has lots of the yellow metal lying around to be made into jewellery. And if the euro goes into freefall, all the better, for folk outside the eurozone will be able to buy his autobiography, Santa's Memoirs, already reduced from \u20ac30 to \u20ac25, even cheaper. And whatever happens, Father Christmas cannot go bankrupt. The whole operation at Rovaniemi, including the 50 red elves, is subsidised by the European Fund for Agricultural Development. Have a good Christmas. Back on 3 January. Ho, bloody ho."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
