He made his debut as Corradino in 1996, and the role remains his display piece of choice. An expensive-looking production was mounted for him in Pesaro in 2004, and both he and it are now at Covent Garden. If you like his athletic-but-cute style, you will have a good time. If, however, you prefer an immaculately integrated evening at the opera, then you may find this wanting. The piece is essentially The Taming of the Shrew with the sexes reversed. Corradino, an implacable misogynist, is turned to amorous jelly after he meets Matilde. She has been put up to seducing him by his doctor, Aliprando: Rossini leaves it unclear as to whether what she is really after is Corradino's cash. The pair of them skirmish away to some of the most ferocious coloratura ever penned. Fl\u00f3rez's sparring partner here is Aleksandra Kurzak, his equal in technique and vocal glamour. She is so staggering that many will probably consider it more her night than his. Yet this is not the whole story. Unevenly written, the opera is also discursively plotted, and it needs more than two stars to make coherent sense. There is some precise conducting from Carlo Rizzi, but apart from Marco Vinco's sensational Aliprando, the rest of the cast aren't in the Fl\u00f3rez-Kurzak league. Baritone Alfonso Antoniozzi is dreadful as the itinerant poet Isidoro, and Vesselina Kasarova, all foghorn chest register and no words, is not much better as Corradino's potential rival, Edoardo. Mario Martone's production, confining the characters on a creaking double staircase even when they are meant to be outdoors, helps absolutely no one. \u2022 Broadcast on Radio 3 on November 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
