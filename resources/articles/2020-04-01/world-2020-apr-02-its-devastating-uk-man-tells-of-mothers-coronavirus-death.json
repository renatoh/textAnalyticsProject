Linda Tuppen, a former nursery nurse and teacher, was discovered on Saturday by her son, Rob, a day after she had refused to speak to NHS\u2019s 111 service when she fell ill, deciding to sleep instead. The 66-year-old woman, who suffered from asthma, had been caring for Rob after he developed Covid-19 symptoms following his return from Krakow, Poland, earlier last month, but then began to feel unwell herself. In a further blow to the family, her other son, James, was admitted to hospital on Sunday with coronavirus symptoms. In an interview with Manchester Evening News, Rob recalled the moment he found his mother at her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. \u201cI was in a panic, she was just laying there, and I shouted \u2018mum, mum,\u2019 but she didn\u2019t answer,\u201d the 28-year-old software engineer said. \u201cI was doing chest compressions until the ambulance came. I was still in the room when he came over and said she was gone. It\u2019s devastating, we lost our father in 2008, so we\u2019re pretty much on our own now. \u201cShe was a kind, loving lady who adored me and James and would have done anything for us. She always used to say that we were her lives. She would do anything for anyone.\u201d Linda, who was vice-chairman of the local neighbourhood watch, developed a chest infection on 23 March and her condition worsened, with pain in her sinuses, leaving her confined to her bed last Thursday and Friday. Increasingly concerned, Rob called NHS 111 but his mother told him she just wanted to sleep. But when he went to check on her the following morning he could not wake her. \u201cThey were fine when I came back, but then I got ill, and they\u2019ve picked it up off me because my mum was looking after me while I was ill,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe was putting a cloth over her mouth but it obviously didn\u2019t work.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is serious. This is not a joke, this could happen to anyone.\u201d Describing his own symptoms during illness, Rob said: \u201cYour temperature is sky high, so you\u2019re constantly freezing cold and shivering, then other times you\u2019re basically roasting hot and you have to take your coat off. \u201cYou have a really high fever and I was constantly freezing cold in bed or roasting to the point where I just had to take all my clothes off because I was that hot. The cough is really bad, when you\u2019re coughing you feel like you can\u2019t stop. \u201cYour body aches and even the smallest of tasks, like going to the toilet, is one of the hardest things you can do. I would have to run from the toilet to my room, which is about five steps, because I felt like I was going to black out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
