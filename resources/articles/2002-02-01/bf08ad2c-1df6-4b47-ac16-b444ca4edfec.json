Mix in two entertaining, in-form sides plus a whiff of English grievance and no wonder great expectations are in the air. Sport is famously littered with examples of the-classic-that-never-was but Clive Woodward was not indulging in cheap hype yesterday when he claimed his side have been as pumped up this week as before any of their big autumn jousts with the southern hemisphere powers. \"This is one of the best Irish teams I've ever seen,\" insisted Woodward, fully aware his own squad has special qualities of its own. \"It should be a great advert for Six Nations rugby.\" He could easily be right and, after a one-sided opening round of matches, there is little doubt this year's tournament could do with an edge-of-the-seat contest, England not having had anything approaching a real Six Nations scare at Twickenham for three years. Scotland's 24-21 defeat in 1999 was an exception but Ireland have been turning up religiously with all manner of lucky charms, from white heather to Willie Duggan's old cigarette ends, and still claimed only one win since 1982. As their sharp new coach Eddie O'Sullivan concedes, the Irish were \"well and truly lambasted\" two years ago when England romped home by 50-18, though recent history offers a better form guide. Not only did Ireland lay waste to Wales 54-10 two weekends ago but memories of their 20-14 victory over the English in Dublin last October are fresh enough to foster shamrock optimism on a ground where England have not lost a Six Nations game for five years. While the knock-on effects of that Lansdowne Road experience have been reduced by England's selection, which amazingly features only five survivors and a mere two - Neil Back and Jonny Wilkinson - in the same positions, Ireland have been able to travel with far more confidence than is normally the case. \"I learned long ago that it's not the ground which wins games but the players on the pitch,\" said the Irish flanker David Wallace, a key member of the Munster team who have stormed any number of previously impregnable citadels in the past three seasons. Today's Irish gameplan will be a subtler variation on the same Munster theme which has worked a treat for Ireland under both O'Sullivan and his predecessor Warren Gatland. David Humphreys at fly-half kicks expertly for territory, his battle-scarred pack trot meaningfully downfield and then the green machine starts to whir. Wallace comes flying off the back of the scrums, Kevin Maggs thunders through the midfield and Brian O'Driscoll, aka God, slips into holes invisible to mere mortals. With Geordan Murphy providing the clever finishing touches, Wales had absolutely no answer. \"The game against Wales was probably the best rugby I've seen from any northern hemisphere team,\" said an admiring Phil Vickery, back at tight-head for England today after breaking a bone in his hand last month. England, though, have based their rise under Woodward on what might be called the 3D effect: Dedication, Diet and Defence. Until recently they have been able to blow sides away with their second-half fitness and, under Phil Larder, their power-packed defence has tended to put the \"ox\" in Fort Knox. Woodward is also far happier with his squad's build-up, which has included \"live\" sessions against Cambridge University. \"We've prepared a lot better. I can't overstate the importance of players not playing on the Sunday before a Test. Even before the Scotland game our preparation wasn't anywhere near what it should have been.\" As for motivation, the England dressing-room is practically awash. Top of the list, clearly, is Martin Johnson, badly missed in Dublin, who has obvious reason to cast aside thoughts of next week's disciplinary hearing . \"I expect him to play the way he always plays for England which is outstandingly well,\" said Woodward, refusing to comment further until after the game. Johnson's Leicester team-mate Austin Healey is equally fired up after blaming the pressures of recent fatherhood on his slightly off-key display against the Scots. \"People say that revenge is not a factor on occasions like this, but it is for me,\" Healey admitted this week. \"We owe Ireland one for what happened last October.\" For good measure England will displace New Zealand at the top of the Zurich World Rankings for the first time if they win by 16 points or more, while a victory of any sort will edge them closer to their elusive grand slam, a sub-plot which has become the oval-ball equivalent of Waiting For Godot. Having mocked the same computer which predicted a 26-point England win prior to their 29-3 victory at Murrayfield, it is only fair to record that a 23-point home win is forecast today. An English victory by nine points is a more human estimate but Ireland have both the self-belief and class to give Woodward anxiety attacks and a lucky sell-out crowd their money's worth.
