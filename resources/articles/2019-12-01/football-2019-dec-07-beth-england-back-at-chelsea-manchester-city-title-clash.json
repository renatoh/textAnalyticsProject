With nine goals this season and a flurry of senior England caps following her first call\u2011up, the Chelsea striker is continuing the fine form that led her to finish joint-third top scorer in the WSL last season with 12 league goals, 19 in all competitions. Except suffer she did. Inked on her left thigh, one of two tattoos that are visible below the edge of her shorts while playing, is the script: \u201cLife\u2019s a gamble so enjoy the game.\u201d Her confidence broke, though, when Chelsea rolled the dice and took a gamble on her career. In 2017, during pre-season in Austria, the manager, Emma Hayes, told her she would be going out on loan. She \u201cburst out crying\u201d, the self-doubt setting in. \u201cI doubted I would come back,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, yeah, I did. Every other player that\u2019s gone on loan from Chelsea hasn\u2019t come back. I\u2019m the only player that\u2019s managed to go away and get a recall.\u201d Two seasons at Liverpool followed and although it took some time to find her rhythm, it helped her find her natural position. \u201cWhen I was here before I played a bit of wing, a bit of forward, then a wing\u2011back, and I couldn\u2019t really find my feet,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to Liverpool gave me the opportunity to just work on a set position, get minutes in the bank and prove what I can do. So, as much as I hated it at the time, it was the best decision, I think, for me and my career. It was more of a test of whether I would sink or swim up there and thankfully I chose to swim.\u201d Did it strengthen her relationship with Hayes, given the loan move paid off? \u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d England says with a laugh. \u201cBut in the same breath I\u2019m the one that had to go and prove it. I\u2019m not going to sit here and slate her because it happened and it has worked out for the best, but it was a bad time for me and it took me quite a while to get out of that mindset of thinking I was not good enough.\u201d That mindset is still there, in the background, but she has \u201cmanaged to loosen the reins a little on making mistakes and getting on with it and not letting things eat me up inside\u201d, she reflects. \u201cI was always a player that was really too much of a perfectionist and very self-critical.\u201d Her delight at being named among the Guardian\u2019s top 100 female footballers for 2019, in at 89, reflects a player that always worked hard but never dared to dream big. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that a lass from Barnsley is now deemed one of the best in the world for football. It\u2019s a bit surreal really,\u201d she says. Three years ago, England was working night shifts in a fish and chip shop and Christmas temping in M&amp;S. \u201cI was part-time at Donny [Doncaster Belles] and at college you\u2019ve got to pay your way,\u201d she says. \u201cI did night shifts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 10pm to 6am, at the chippy. So there would be times when I would have two or three hours\u2019 sleep before I\u2019m getting on the coach for an away game. \u201cOr, say, if we went to play a team like Yeovil, we\u2019d get back at like 9pm, quick shower, get my tea and then straight back out to work and do a night shift. I actually used to do the Christmas orders at M&amp;S so I would spend three night shifts in the freezer. On top of that, juggling A-levels was quite difficult.\u201d A powerful, strong forward with great technical ability, England shows a fight and drive that is clearly a product of that work ethic. \u201cI\u2019ve got an assignment to write. Just 3,000 words on parliamentary sovereignty\u201d for the law degree she is halfway through, part-time with the Open University and with the support of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. Once the essay is out of the way, there is the not insignificant matter of a crucial match in the title race when Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Kingsmeadow on Sunday. \u201cThe league has got tougher and it is still getting harder and harder each year to play against even the top teams, there is no whitewashing that.\u201d A goal would be nice too, though? \u201cTo score against the bigger clubs always tends to mean a bit more. I\u2019ve had a few against Arsenal and they mean a lot to me. The last time I scored against City was at Liverpool, a header, so it would be pretty sweet to put one away just before Christmas and help the team. But I just want three points.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
