Williamson, employed at the time at Elgin &amp; Hall, a fireplace manufacturer based in North Yorkshire, left the company soon after attending the meeting, they said. The former chief whip, tipped as a possible prime minister, took the extraordinary step last week of giving an interview to the Daily Mail to talk about the \u201cflirtatious relationship\u201d. He went to the Mail hours after getting a series of questions from the Guardian. In the Daily Mail article, he said the relationship \u201cbecame flirtatious and a couple of times we shared a kiss\u201d. Williamson said he decided to leave the company to save his marriage to Joanne, a former schoolteacher. His lawyers refused to tell the Guardian: Whether the woman reported Williamson\u2019s behaviour to her line manager and an internal process followed. What the outcome of that process was. The terms on which he departed and whether he received a payoff. Whether it was right for a managing director to engage in a relationship with a junior colleague. Why there appears to be no mention of his employment at Elgin &amp; Hall in his official profile or social media. The latest details have emerged amid claims that he exaggerated a threat from Russia to distract the media from the allegations about his personal life. Unnamed security sources said Williamson made \u201calarmist\u201d claims after telling the Daily Telegraph that Russia could kill thousands of British citizens in a cyber-attack. He was also accused of misusing US intelligence \u2013 a claim the MoD has denied. One security official told the Sunday Times of concerns that going into such detail about what is known about Russian surveillance in the UK could compromise sources and anger the UK\u2019s intelligence partners: \u201cHe used intelligence, not all of it the UK\u2019s, to try to distract attention.\u201d A Whitehall source said the timing of both the Daily Mail and the Telegraph interviews \u2013 which both emerged on Thursday night after the Guardian had issued questions about Elgin &amp; Hall \u2013 had surprised officials. \u201cThe sequence of events was very odd. Maybe a coincidence, but not many civil servants believe in coincidences,\u201d the source said. Sources said events at Elgin &amp; Hall came to a head in the summer of 2004, when the woman told her direct line manager about her working relationship with Williamson. A meeting was held to discuss the issue with senior executives from the firm\u2019s parent company Aga Foodservice Group, it is claimed. Days later, former staff claim, Williamson left the company and the group. Aga declined to comment. The Russia\u2019s defence ministry has ridiculed Williamson\u2019s claims of possible deaths from a cyber-attack. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov compared them to a Monty Python sketch and speculated that it was part of a lobbying campaign for more money for the MoD. \u201cHis fears about Russia getting pictures of power plants and studying the routes of British pipelines are worthy of a comic plot or a Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus sketch,\u201d he said. A source close to Williamson said that the decision to give an interview to the Telegraph was made more than a week before it actually happened, adding that the language used was within the parameters of a briefing prepared by officials. \u201cWe have sought clarity from GCHQ and MI6 about whether there was any confidential information that was intelligence led that would have been difficult and they have come back to us and had no problem with the content,\u201d the source said. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cThe secretary of state did not release any classified material at any point during discussions with the media, and there has been no leak of intelligence on this subject from either the secretary of state or the Ministry of Defence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
