A leading official at NHS London, the city's strategic health authority, said it intended to push through changes so that the service could cope with an imminent financial squeeze in the NHS and deliver better quality and more accessible treatment for patients. A report tomorrow from the London region of the BMA, which represents 33,500 medics, warns that patients in London will lose out if many existing district general hospitals are downgraded to local hospitals that have been stripped of key services. Sam Higginson, NHS London's assistant director of strategy, acknowledged that a diversion of patients from hospital services such as A&amp;E and specialist clinics to community surgeries staffed by GPs will mean that some hospitals will close altogether and others will be turned into new-style polyclinics, which provide a range of hospital-style services. He defended its plans, saying : \"No change will lead to the death of the NHS in London by a thousand cuts. No change is not an option.\" NHS London proposes that by 2017 about 75% of all visits to casualty and 50% of all out-patient appointments, especially for long-term conditions such as diabetes, will be dealt with by a network of 100 polyclinics. That, and parallel plans to centralise in a smaller number of centres specialist medical services such as stroke care and trauma treatment, will mean that London has an unsustainably high number of hospitals, Higginson said. \"This isn't going to be easy but we believe there is a really compelling case for change.\" The changes mean that as many as a third of the beds in London hospitals would disappear, he added. \"We are starting from a place where we have [in London] too many beds already \u2013 significantly more than the rest of the population.\" The lack of productivity of NHS staff in the city relative to their counterparts elsewhere, including doctors, reinforced the need for change, he said. Both Labour and the Conservatives have promised to do all they can to protect the NHS from spending cuts in the next few years. But rises in line with inflation would prompt cutbacks because of the rising cost of healthcare and growing demand for treatment. Uncertainty about future income had forced NHS London to take dramatic action, Higginson said. The changes did not necessarily mean a hospital would shut completely. \"We anticipate that some current standard hospitals will become polyclinics, [but] we don't know how many,\" he said. \"We think we could deliver about 50% of outpatients, and about two-thirds of A&amp;E attendances could be dealt with at polyclinics, but we haven't worked out how many hospitals that would mean changing.\" A decision has already been made to close the A&amp;E unit and women's and children's services department at Chase Farm hospital in Enfield, north London, while Queen Mary's hospital in Sidcup, south-east London, no longer provides a wide range of acute services and will become a polyclinic. MPs including the higher education minister, David Lammy, are campaigning to stop the Whittington hospital in Islington, north London, having its A&amp;E unit merged with the one at the Royal Free hospital in nearby Hampstead. The BMA report, London's NHS on the Brink, warns that the upheaval in London could be the start of a painful and unpopular process of restructuring of the NHS across England. As much as \u00a35bn could have been cut from London's NHS budget by 2017, it warns. The huge financial liabilities being carried by many of London's hospital trusts, to finance a huge rebuilding programme, will mean that works costing \u00a32.65bn will ultimately lead to total payments of \u00a316.7bn over the lifetime of the contracts involved, which will create serious financial problems, said the report's author, Dr John Lister. Some medical leaders support reconfiguration of hospital services, while others are strongly opposed. Last night John Black, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, warned that caution was needed before major changes occurred. \"The college believes any reorganisation of NHS services must only be undertaken where there is strong evidence that patients will benefit or remain unaffected by the change,\" he said. \"Reconfiguration of services should not take place for reasons of political, financial or managerial expediency.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2010. The original said that at Chase Farm hospital the A&amp;E unit and the children's department had recently closed. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
