The legendary cricketer, commentator and former England captain died aged 70 on Wednesday. Where else to start our tribute than Headingley 1981, and his unforgettable Ashes spell of 8 for 43. Willis excelled against New Zealand at the same ground two years later, taking match figures of 9 for 92 as he passed 300 England wickets. A courageous, relentless pace bowler, Willis came back from a double knee operation in 1975 \u2013 taking seven first-innings wickets at Lord\u2019s in the first Ashes Test in 1977. Willis forged a vintage partnership with Ian Botham \u2013 here are both men reminiscing in 2017. And here\u2019s the great man giving us his all-time cricketing XI. After his retirement, Willis became a straight-talking, often unforgiving pundit \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t afraid to tell it like it was back in his playing days, either. Bob Willis, we salute you. 2) What do F1 drivers do now their season has ended? Karting on ice of course, if you\u2019re Max Verstappen and Pierre Gasly. Going back a couple of decades, Damon Hill took some time out to star in a Harry Enfield sketch. 3) Joe Denly\u2019s dropping of New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson on the last day of the second Test on Tuesday was a dolly for the ages, but if it\u2019s any consolation, some of the greats have had their howlers in the field too. Here\u2019s 10 of the best/worst. And a reminder of a former England captain, Mike Gatting, dropping an even easier one, against India in 1993. 4) The past is a foreign country: Dixie Dean enjoys a fag and a hearty glass of wine as he discusses Everton\u2019s 1933 FA Cup triumph with Sam Cowan, captain of their defeated opponents Manchester City, who won the Cup the next year. The Cup left Lancashire in 1935, though, crossing the Pennines to Sheffield after Wednesday beat West Brom at Wembley. And while we\u2019re in a 1930s rabbit hole, learn from the pros with this exquisitely of-its-time FA-sponsored cinematic coaching manual. 5) It\u2019s the Manchester derby this weekend, so here are three each of the two sides\u2019 more treasured memories. City first, with Denis Law\u2019s backheel rubbing salt in the wounds at Old Trafford as United\u2019s relegation is confirmed; newly-promoted City putting Alex Ferguson on edge in 1989 by walloping them 5-1 at Maine Road. At the other end of the Ferguson era, City\u2019s 6-1 romp at Old Trafford in 2011 signalled the turning of the tables. For United fans, here\u2019s a chance to revel in some vintage Eric Cantona as the Reds come from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Maine Road in 1993. Things got even better in the return at Old Trafford, 5-0 their winning margin. Delving deeper into the archives, here\u2019s two Brian Kidd goals as United win a 1970 FA Cup fourth-round tie 3-0. 6) It\u2019s raining toys \u2013 hallelujah! The Hershey Bears ice hockey team host their annual Teddy Bear Toss for charity. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Some choice booing as Dundee equalise in the last minute against Queen of the South, then immediately concede a winner after a defensive howler. Decent first goal by the visitors too. 2) Is Vita Vea the heaviest person ever to receive a touchdown pass? 3) Some more Tiger Woods magic here, here and here. 4) Greg Norman\u2019s 1986 heartache at the hands of Bob Tway. 5) That famous Cruyff teamwork penalty for Ajax.
