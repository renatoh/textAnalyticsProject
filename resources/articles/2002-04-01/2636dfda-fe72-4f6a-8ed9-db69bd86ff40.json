Drivers, members of Aslef and employed by First North Western, staged their second strike this week over the sacking of a colleague who managers claim went through two red lights and was caught speeding. On Arriva, the industrial action by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union was the seventh instance in a pay dispute by conductors claiming not to have been awarded percentage increases comparable to those given to drivers. The strikes disrupted the journeys of holidaymakers and commuters. As none of First North Western's 1,500 trains was running, buses were provided at Piccadilly station in Manchester to destinations such as Bar row, Preston and Manchester airport. Arriva said about 55% of its trains were running to usual timetables. \"I can't believe my bad luck,\" said Tony Lightfoot, 30, who was waiting for a replacement bus service in Manchester. \"I can usually go straight from my home town of Doncaster to Manchester airport, but not today when I'm flying out for a three week holiday in Thailand. My plane leaves at 1.30pm, it's now 12.10pm and there's no sign of these buses.\" Other passengers, waiting in the almost deserted station, put on a brave face. Peter Barclay, 33, a clerical officer from Sunderland, sympathised with train staff. \"In their situation you can understand it, but it is frustrating.\" He expressed annoyance at having spent four hours on a coach with the prospect of a further two hours on a train to get to Hertfordshire for the weekend. \"I knew about the train strike before I set off but there's no other way I can get to where I need to be.\" A customer services worker from Railtrack said: \"People seem pretty clued up about the strike action, so they're only travelling if they know their service is not affected or if it's vital for them to travel.\" She said that striking could be interpreted as nothing more than a show of solidarity among workers. \"Going through a red light is a hanging offence, so I can't see why they're backing this driver.\" The drivers say they are prepared to strike for a third day on Monday unless agreement is reached quickly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
