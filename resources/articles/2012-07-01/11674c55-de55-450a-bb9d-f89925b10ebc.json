Gates. Low-slung dogs with their tongues out. These are the component parts of rural Mid Wales' equivalent of football's World Cup: a celebration of absurdly well-trained working dogs and nerveless handlers, who'll be ushering sheep around courses with pinpoint accuracy.

A new Body Art category will get heads turning, as will Toffee, the miniature-donkey-turned-model. Who needs Milan and Paris?
