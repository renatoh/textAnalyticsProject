Catt last played for Woodward 14 months ago when England beat South Africa 29-9 but the 31-year-old's injuries have taken longer and longer to heal. In the 30 minutes the medics allowed Catt to play on Saturday, he looked a class apart. With his second touch, he burst through a previously untroubled Montauban defence for Bath's first try, and with his fourth touch sculpted an opening which Nathan Thomas galloped through for the second. Within three minutes Catt had pulled Bath back from 9-18 down to lead 21-18 on the day and go level on aggregate. All that remained was for Ollie Barkley to convert one of three kickable penalties. He missed the first two but the third scraped inside the left upright. \"Mike Catt is a world-class player,\" his Bath coach Mike Foley said later. \"Everything he did today was class.\" Bath are one off the bottom of the Zurich Premiership, and face Northampton in the cup next Saturday. Europe is probably the best option for silverware. But until Catt's arrival in the 54th minute, Montauban's pack was destroying the Bath scrummage - \"Our front row are ready to slit their wrists,\" Foley said after the game. On the rare occasions when Bath struggled upfield they were punished. In the 24th minute the former Bordeaux centre Pierre-Henri Vermis opened up the Bath defence with ease to prompt a 50-metre move that ended with his full-back Pierre Bondouy going over wide on the left. Fifteen minutes later, with Bath battering at the French gates, Stanislas Durand seized a fumble and began a move downfield which eventually saw the classy Vermis home. Foley put the recovery down to his side's strength of character. Most of the 6,000 watching would have ascribed it to the inspiration of one man. But just as Catt's performance will put a smile on Woodward's face, a shoulder injury to Balshaw is likely to remove it. The former England fullback will have a scan today. At best he is likely to be out for two or three weeks, leaving little time before England v France on February 15.
