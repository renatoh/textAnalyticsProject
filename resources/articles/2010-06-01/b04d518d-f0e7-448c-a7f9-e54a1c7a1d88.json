We must go on to the end if civilisation is to survive.\" This could be Goebbels talking about the Jews, but in fact it is General Thomas Blamey urging Australian troops to take revenge on the Japanese for atrocities such as rape, torture, murder and cannibalism. And this was not the only time when allied attitudes duplicated those of the Nazis. US marines went into combat on Iwo Jima with the words \"Rodent Exterminator\" stencilled on their helmets. Michael Burleigh, who cites these instances in his magnificent moral survey of the second world war, is not suggesting any ethical equivalence between the democracies and the dictatorships (one of which was, of course, an ally). He is contemptuous of those who try to equate, say, Auschwitz and Hiroshima: whereas the Jews posed no threat to Germany, the atom bomb was used against a foe that was not only still fighting but (a point seldom made) killing more than 100,000 Asian slave labourers each month. No, what Burleigh does is to chart the prevailing moral sentiment of the belligerent states and their leaders and to examine how this changed under the pressure of war. He avoids moralising, \"which is to morality what artiness is to art\". His book is a moral map, not a moral compass. Yet he writes with a marvellous trenchancy that sometimes becomes savage indignation. Burleigh's account of Neville Chamberlain's foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, usually treated with respect as \"the Holy Fox\", is splendidly scathing. \"His memoirs describe with pious, self-deprecating smugness his smooth ascent, via Eton, All Souls and Delhi, where he was viceroy, all achieved through luck and nepotism, and padded with the usual tedious Oxbridge legends of deaf college porters and solecisms about handling the port which make Englishmen seem like retarded bores.\" Burleigh is especially caustic about Hannah Arendt's oft-quoted remark concerning the \"banality of evil\". Referring to Adolf Eichmann, it implies that those involved in the final solution were unimaginative clerks. Actually Eichmann was a thug as well as a bureaucrat, who screamed at Jews: \"Pig, stand against the wall when you address me.\" Furthermore, Burleigh reminds us, the Holocaust was not just a clanking process of industrialised homicide. Some 2.9 million Jews were murdered by men standing a few feet away from them. Hardly anyone was compelled to kill or punished for refusing since, as one SS infantryman testified, \"there were always enough volunteers\". The explanation for this, Burleigh argues, was that the perpetrators retained a sense of morality. Victims of a pseudo-scientific belief in the inequality of human races, they felt engaged in a historic mission to purge the world of Untermenschen. Thus Himmler could talk about the decency and heroism of those who undertook the unpleasant task. Similar considerations governed the conduct of German forces in the Soviet Union and resulted in the death of 3.3 million Russian prisoners of war. Yet perhaps this is not the whole story. As Burleigh acknowledges, most Germans nominally subscribed to Christian values \u2013 unlike the Japanese, who had a \"genuine excuse\" for savagery since they possessed no moral code overriding their duty to the divine emperor. Furthermore, even the SS death squads were appalled by the bloody work of their Romanian auxiliaries on the eastern front \u2013 repaid in kind, needless to say, by the Red Army. And at home many Germans concluded that the allied bombing raids were a revenge for the monstrous crime committed against the Jews, which suggested widespread guilt and awareness. The RAF's attack on German cities began unintentionally, because after Dunkirk Churchill had no other weapon, because bombers could not hit targets with precision and because the public demanded retaliation for the blitz. The politicians did not acknowledge that they were aiming at civilians, though Churchill himself veered between acute anxiety over the use of terror tactics and an intense desire to smash the Third Reich to smithereens. Burleigh admires Air Marshal \"Bomber\" Harris for his forthright assault on venal arms manufacturers (assisted by corrupt ex-inmates of the Ministry of Defence) and his candour about the bombing campaign. It was not a war crime, Burleigh says. But he admits that many regard it as \"morally repugnant\" and he takes seriously Bishop Bell's claim that it detracted from the fundamental justice of the allied cause. Despite its subtitle, this book is not a history of the second world war; far from being comprehensive, it contains, for example, almost nothing about the war at sea and concentrates largely on Hitler, \"'our' monster\". What Burleigh has produced is a long, brilliant, original, opinionated and scholarly meditation on morality as it appeared, or failed to appear, during the last global conflict. A few stylistic and factual slips apart, it is virtually impeccable. Seldom has a study of the past combined such erudition with such exuberance.
