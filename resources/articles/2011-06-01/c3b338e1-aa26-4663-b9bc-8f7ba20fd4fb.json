It is always comforting to hear like-minded thinkers, but the \"Yes to AV\" campaign neatly illustrated the futility of preaching to the choir. To their credit, the no campaign addressed everyday voters' fears, albeit via emotional ploys and suspect data. In contrast, the yes campaign's message was directed solely at metropolitan Guardian readers. The no campaign talked incubators and police. The yes campaign wheeled out celebrity lefties. Already, there are some positive responses to the New College (Boris Johnson's deadpan article in the Telegraph, An Oxbridge for those who can't get into Oxbridge). Detractors cannot go on pretending these points of view do not exist; the privatisation of higher education is simply too important for such self-indulgence. We can only hope that the \"No to AC\" campaign pushes itself to mobilise beyond parochial tick\u2011box resistance. Writing to MPs would be a start. James Poskett London \u2022\u2008Earlier this week you published six letters concerning the proposed New College of the Humanities. Each is unremittingly negative about the proposal. While they do not, of course, constitute a proper sample of the relevant academic population, I suspect their querulously defensive tone is pretty much typical. More's the pity. Why not congratulate Grayling and his colleagues for their enterprise and originality? Why take it as simply and uncritically given that a mixed economy of higher education is to be condemned? Why imagine that jealous bitchiness contributes anything to reasoned argument? Too many academics nowadays moan all the time \u2013 and call it critical thinking. Emeritus Professor David Marsland Brunel University \u2022\u2008The publicity surrounding the creation of the New College of the Humanities draws attention to academics setting up \"new models\" for higher education. However, not all are based on the same marketised principles as those proposed by AC Grayling. The Social Science Centre in Lincoln is a worker-student co-operative that will provide university-level education. Members will pay a contribution to the running costs based on what they can afford, and no wages are paid to the teaching staff. The centre is based on the most progressive and radical pedagogies, with quality assured through a system of academic peer review. This will be a sustainable model that could be replicated by different subject areas in different locations. It is due to open in 2011-12. For more details see socialsciencecentre.org.uk. Mike Neary and Joss Winn Lincoln \u2022\u2008Who can afford these fees? I can! About to retire for the second time and looking for something meaningful for my golden years, with the resources to match, no mortgage on my London house and a mind now really ready for philosophy, I shall apply as soon as possible. It would be unfair to try to take a scarce place from a proper first-timer, but this is clearly the opportunity for the establishment of a proper University of the Third Age. Bring it on. Ann Robinson London \u2022\u2008Here's a couple of questions for the compulsory \"ethics\" and \"critical thinking\" courses at the \u00a354,000 fee New College. First, is it a sign of moral bankruptcy for a bunch of affluent academic celebrities to offer a few big name lectures in order to make profits for themselves while deploring government policies promoting dependence on fees? And second, is a profit-seeking college more likely to mean financial bankruptcy for indebted students or, as with other commercial takeovers of public services, the academic business itself? (Extra marks will be given for evidence that students have ever managed direct contact with a celebrity professor.)
