We are to understand that he knows what he likes. His \"treasured Scottish housekeeper\", May, hands him a tray with his breakfast and the Times, \"the only paper Bond ever read\". Why should we be told this as almost the first indication of his tastes or opinions? In a different kind of novel it would signify that he was reactionary or narrow-minded. Here it means that he is an exacting man, unswayed by fashion. The newspaper is the first of the novel's brands. Soon Bond's breakfast is being itemised in a manner that assures us of his qualities of character. Brands mark decisiveness and sagacity. Once Bond has discovered what is best, he never veers. When in London, his breakfast is \"always the same\": coffee from De Bry in New Oxford Street, brewed in an American Chemex, drunk from Minton china; toast with Norwegian heather honey from Fortnum's; a single brown egg, from a French Marans hen. Even the chicken sounds like a luxury brand. As he travels, the brands vary, signifiers of cosmopolitan choosiness. In From Russia with Love he goes to Turkey, where he smokes delicious Diplomate cigarettes and drinks Kavaklidere with his first Turkish meal (he knows it is \"a rich coarse burgundy like any other Balkan wine\"). Other novels feature a huge variety of wines and champagnes; only in the films does he stick to vodka martini, \"shaken not stirred\". The brand names are also there for the novels' machines. Bond cannot board a plane without remarking its exact make and specifications. His car is a Continental Bentley - \"the 'R' type chassis with the big 6 engine and a 13:40 back-axle ratio\". Fleming originated this tactic. Now we are habituated to novelists' use of brand labels, often lazily, to persuade us of the credibility of a character, or a way of life. Some of it bolsters what I have heard called \"recognition fiction\": novels whose credibility requires the readers to recognise a lifestyle that they share. Brands are key signifiers here. But Bond's brands are different. They constitute a language that would scarcely have been more foreign to Fleming's first readers than it is now. They are calculated to intrigue a British audience that, in 1957 when From Russia with Love was first published, had only recently struggled out of postwar austerity. As the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell said at the time: \"The combination of sex, violence, and alcohol and - at intervals - good food is, to one who lives a circumscribed life as I do, irresistible.\" Our new age of novelistic product placement is represented with satirical excess by the pursuit of Fleming's device in Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho (1991). This novel's psychopathic yuppie narrator, Patrick Bateman, cannot separate character from object of consumption. \"Courtney opens the door and she's wearing a Krizia cream silk blouse and Krizia rust tweed skirt and silk-satin d'Orsay pumps from Manolo Blahnik.\" There is a kind of absurd poetry to it. Even in solitude, Bateman clutches at his brands. A visit to his own bathroom becomes a materialistic hymn. \"I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink - with soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile ... Then I squeeze Rembrandt on to a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush.\" Fleming also enjoys luxurious bathrooms, like the one in Dr No's lair, where Bond finds himself comforted with just the right products. \"There was everything in the bathroom - Floris Lime bath essence for men and Guerlain bathcubes for women... The soap was Guerlain's Sapoceti, Fleurs des Alpes.\" Yet we know that all this, down to the Lentheric after-shave lotion, is to soften Bond before the kill. The luxury products are seductive, but they are tricks of the villain's trade. Bond is an epicure, for sure, but one who must finally escape temptation. \"The blubbery arms of the soft life had Bond around the neck and they were slowly strangling him\", we are told at the opening of From Russia with Love. All those brands can best be savoured by the man who is not beguiled by them. \u00b7 John Mullan is senior lecturer in English at University College London \u00b7 Have your say about James Bond on the Guardian talkboards or write to The Review, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
