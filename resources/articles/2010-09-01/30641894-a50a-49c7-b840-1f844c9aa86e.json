And perhaps one shouldn't set too much store by weekend reports that Ken Clarke has given a wigging to Theresa May over the failure of the Home Office to deport a sufficient number of foreign convicts. But if he is chucking his weight about and she wants to hit him back, she might raise his current misbehaviour over the European protection order, which was framed to protect victims of crime and specifically provided new protections at EU level for victims of domestic abuse. It will mean that victims receive the highest level of protection from abuse within and across the member states. Barely a month after taking office, cuddly Ken placed a formal objection in the council of ministers, a destabilising tactic that pleased the Eurosceptics, who oppose any further EU harmonisation, particularly in home affairs. But it also devastated those desperate to afford battered women greater protection throughout the EU. So if Ken's in accusing mode, isn't it a case of \"Let he who is without sin \u2026\" \u2022 More news from the war on terror as it is unfolding in the departure lounges of Heathrow. Last week we revealed how Liberty boss Shami Chakrabarti, on a business trip to Belfast, was picked out at random not just for the normal search, but for the full security treatment with a body scanner. Well what do you know, 48 hours later, Equality and Human Rights Commission chief Trevor Phillips, travelling from Heathrow to Belfast, was randomly selected at the same place for more of the same. His experience seemed a lot less stressful than hers and the attendant didn't smirk throughout, but any more of this celebrity scanning and folk will be asking: how does this random approach work exactly? Perhaps it's the Belfast-bound passengers the scanners are worried about. Just like the old days. \u2022 And they are counting down the days in Hackney, east London, to October: Black History Month. And what better way to mark the annual event than the announcement that when the replacement for the CLR James library is redeveloped and reopened next spring it will no longer be the CLR James library, as it has been since 1985. Despite burgeoning protests, it will be called the Dalston library and archives. Which is obviously a better way of recognising the contribution of this towering man of letters (think Beyond a Boundary, Black Jacobins). And \"Dalston library\" has a much better ring about it, don't you think? \u2022 Meanwhile, it was a fortnight ago, but still the talk in the salons of central London is the lavish party thrown by the children of Mohamed Al Fayed to celebrate his 26 years as chairman of Harrods. No expense was spared as celebrity guests mingled with titans from the business world. As reported here, there was comedy, as the giant Sphinx cake produced to mark the occasion suffered a mishap and had its head knocked off. Mystery, too, as guests obscured from the action tried to find out how it happened. Sources initially fingered the PR guru Brian Basham, but now we learn that it absolutely, definitely positively wasn't him. \"I confess that I have lost my head a few times over the years and therefore can be said to have lived up to my name,\" he tells us. \"But I did not knock the head off the Sphinx.\" So who was it? Was there a culprit? Or, as some believe, did the head merely fall under its own weight? The cake has all gone, and they say it was delicious. But still, there are pressing issues to resolve about that night. \u2022 Finally, by the very nature of their work they deal with hopes dashed and the stuff of human desperation. But that doesn't mean Home Office staff can't have a giggle among themselves. \"Stowaways found by border officials among boxes of Ferrero Rocher chocolates. What would the ambassador say?\" was the official departmental line on Twitter last Friday as Iranian and Iraqi migrants were found in a lorry from France. Amid the misery, it helps to smile. This article was amended on 21 September 2010. The original gave the title of a CLR James book as Beyond the Boundary.
