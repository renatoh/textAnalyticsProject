There was nothing unusual in that. Voormann had known the Beatles for nine years and was part of the band\u2019s tight inner circle. It was Voormann\u2019s own band, Paddy, Klaus and Gibson, that Lennon and George Harrison had attempted to go and see live on the night they were famously dosed with LSD at a dinner party. Ringo Starr was already at the gig and was noisily confronted by his lysergically altered bandmates claiming that the venue\u2019s lift was on fire. A year later, he had designed the Grammy award-winning cover of Revolver. The issue was more what Lennon wanted him to do. Lennon had whimsically agreed to perform live at a rock\u2019n\u2019roll revival festival in Toronto at two days\u2019 notice and was trying to cobble together backing musicians to play as the Plastic Ono Band. Eric Clapton had agreed to play guitar, but Voormann took more convincing, on the not-unreasonable grounds that headlining a festival with a new band who hadn\u2019t rehearsed didn\u2019t seem like one of Lennon\u2019s more inspired ideas. \u201cJohn said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll rehearse on the plane.\u2019 So there we were, sitting in the last row, next to the jets, and me playing an electric bass with no amplifier,\u201d he says, crackling down the phone line from his home in Bavaria. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear a thing that I was doing. I was more nervous for John than me. I mean, John \u2013 the Beatle \u2013 suddenly going up on stage with a band that hadn\u2019t rehearsed. It was incredible.\u201d Moreover, Lennon had elected not just to play a brief set of rock\u2019n\u2019roll covers befitting a festival that also featured Gene Vincent, Little Richard and Bo Diddley, but to cede the microphone to Yoko Ono, who performed two ear-splitting improvisations, one of which lasted more than 12 minutes. \u201cPeople were just open-mouthed. They are at a rock\u2019n\u2019roll festival with Chuck Berry, and then suddenly this avant garde thing is presented,\u201d he says. \u201cI was up on stage, standing behind Yoko, she\u2019s screaming and shouting and croaking like a dying bird, and I felt \u2018this is about the Vietnam war\u2019 \u2013 I really saw tanks next to me and bombs falling and dead people, that was the thing she was expressing. But I thought: \u2018My God, John must be mad to do this.\u2019 I mean, we were lucky people didn\u2019t throw tomatoes at him.\u201d Still, he says, there were advantages to Yoko\u2019s brand of live performance. \u201cWhen you really know it\u2019s that crazy, you don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, what am I going to do on stage?\u2019 You\u2019re not scared, you just do it, it\u2019s easy. I mean,\u201d he laughs, \u201cyou can make all the mistakes you want \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s punk.\u201d Perhaps Voormann should have been used to unexpected situations involving the Beatles. He was an art student with a love of jazz, Nouvelle Vague cinema and a penchant for dressing like a young French intellectual when he first encountered them in 1960. After storming out of his girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr\u2019s home during a row, he found himself outside a particularly seedy club in Hamburg\u2019s St Pauli district, transfixed by the racket emanating from within. He had heard rock\u2019n\u2019roll before, although his tastes tended more towards Miles Davis, but he had never heard it played live, and certainly not with the ragged energy of nascent Beatles. Nevertheless, he says, he was torn about entering the club, which was visibly \u201cdangerous\u201d. It\u2019s easy to romanticise the Beatles\u2019 years in Hamburg \u2013 Birth of a Legend, as one live album recorded there put it \u2013 but Voormann says the reality was genuinely frightening. \u201cIt was the dirty part of Hamburg, hookers and pimps running around. There were knife fights in the clubs. I thought: \u2018Oh Christ, I\u2019m not going in there.\u2019 But eventually, I pulled myself together and did go in.\u201d He later returned with Kirchherr and their friend J\u00fcrgen Vollmer: they looked so out of place that the waiters took pity on them and \u201ctook care of us if there was a fight going on\u201d. After initially being rebuffed by Lennon, they struck up a friendship with the band, aided by the fact that Kirchherr invited them to her parents\u2019 house so they could have a bath: the band\u2019s living conditions were so squalid that they were forced to wash and shave using water from the club\u2019s urinals. Kirchherr began a relationship with the band\u2019s bassist Stuart Sutcliffe and, most famously, the band adopted the same appearance as their new friends, abandoning their leathers and quiffs in favour of combing their hair forward: the mop-top. Lennon dubbed the Germans \u201cthe exis\u201d, short for existentialists, apparently incorrectly. \u201cMaybe we looked like those French artists, but we were not existentialists,\u201d says Voormann. \u201cWe weren\u2019t political at all. We took them to the pictures so they could see these films we loved \u2013 Jean Cocteau, Louis Malle \u2013 and we went to exhibitions and turned them on to French art.\u201d One night at the Kaiserkeller, Sutcliffe handed Voormann his bass guitar and told him to go on stage instead of him. He was a guitarist, but had no experience with the instrument. The first time he played bass was on stage with the Beatles, which seems faintly incredible, even if Voormann says the reality was less thrilling. \u201cWell, you see, that sounds so fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was a rock\u2019n\u2019roll band, they were playing in the middle of the night, Stuart was wanting to have a break so he could cuddle with Astrid on the sofa. So I sort of played along on a Fats Domino number.\u201d He says he always knew the Beatles were going to be big \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait for them to be famous\u201d \u2013 but clearly had no idea of the scale of what was about to happen. He came to England in 1963, by which time Sutcliffe was dead \u2013 he\u2019d left the band to stay with Kirchherr in Hamburg before suffering a brain haemorrhage, aged 21 \u2013 and Beatlemania was in full swing. Voormann shared a flat with Harrison and Starr, struck by the sense of how pleased they seemed to see an old face amid the ensuing madness. Later, he watched the band slowly disintegrate: \u201cThose 10 years were more than enough. Ringo would have stayed with the band, he loved everybody, but the rest, there was lots of anger, fights: they couldn\u2019t have done it any longer because they were all in completely different directions. Abbey Road, it\u2019s a beautiful LP, but \u2026 from a feeling point of view it wasn\u2019t right to do it. They had to do it because they had obligations to the record company. But they did it really professional and fantastic, and that\u2019s what makes a good band, you know?\u201d Indeed, at one point during the band\u2019s split, a persistent \u2013 and apparently completely unfounded \u2013 rumour suggested Voormann was going to join the Beatles, or rather, that Lennon, Harrison and Starr were going to form a new band called the Ladders, with Voormann replacing Paul McCartney. Instead, he played on all three\u2019s solo albums throughout the 70s. He has a particular affection for 1970s John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band: \u201cEverything done in two takes, no fussing about, so raw and fresh and direct \u2026 Nobody ever told me what to play. I always played what I felt would suit the spirit of the song or the lyrics. \u201cHe always did that, on all the sessions I did: Imagine, Walls and Bridges, Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll. But let\u2019s say if I ever played a wrong note or played shit, he would have told me. The same with the cover of Revolver: if I hadn\u2019t come up with a good idea, then I wouldn\u2019t have got the job \u2013 \u2018Sorry, Klaus \u2026\u2019\u201d Voormann subsequently became an in-demand session musician \u2013 it\u2019s him playing the famous bass intro on Carly Simon\u2019s You\u2019re So Vain and playing on Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day, the latter a session he remembers largely for the amount of camp badinage passing between Reed and co-producer David Bowie. He spent the 70s in Los Angeles, returning to Germany at the end of the decade. Before he left the US, he visited Lennon at home in New York, and found him in househusband mode, boiling rice to make sushi and expounding on the joy of no longer having a record deal or the pressure that came with it. But he was struck by an odd sense of foreboding. \u201cI went with my son, Otto, who was the same age as Sean. We went for a walk in Central Park and John had Sean in a backpack. We walked out through the basement, where the garage was, and I thought: \u2018Oh Christ, this is scary. All those really crazy people in New York and there\u2019s John Lennon just walking around with no bodyguards or anything!\u2019 I was scared for him: \u2018My God, if that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing every day \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d Back in Germany, Voormann worked with Trio, the post-punk band famed for the 1982 hit Da Da Da, but eventually gave up music to concentrate on writing and art. He designed the covers for the Beatles\u2019 Anthology compilations, and in recent years, has published books and a graphic novel about his time with the Beatles and worked with Liam Gallagher on the packaging of his solo debut As You Were. At 82, he has contributed a series of drawings to a new book about Lennon\u2019s early solo career, and the making of the John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album \u2013 one of them depicts the chaotic in-flight rehearsal for the Toronto rock festival, the musicians crammed together at the rear of the plane. These days, he says, he no longer even owns a bass guitar. \u201cTo play bass all by yourself is a bit silly,\u201d he says: who could he possibly play with? \u201cI was spoiled,\u201d he chuckles.
