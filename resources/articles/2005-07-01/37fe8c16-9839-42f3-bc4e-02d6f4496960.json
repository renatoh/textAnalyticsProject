Well, I don't", "bodyText": "The human propensity to having opinions must, I guess, have started as a pretty useful evolutionary tool. \"Hey, Ug, you know what? Those orange berries, I think they gave me indigestion.\" \"I don't know, Ig, that's a very interesting theory. But have you considered that maybe you should stop eating all that wool?\" But this habit has led, in our more evolved societies, to a great deal of unnecessary mental activity. Most of us now have opinions on such things as road tolling, the US position on climate change, and the correct colour of a newsreader's tie on the occasion of a state tragedy, which are way beyond the arena of things we have any control over. It's not like these policy positions are even going to be useful at parties. Because if you find yourself at a party talking about road tolling, you're probably not going to be invited back. So why do we bother? Why do I bother having all my stupid opinions? I mean, really, my ever evolving Balkan policy of the mid-1990s - what did I think was going to happen? That I was going to be supersubbed out of Oddbins and into the Foreign Office? \"Bad news, Prime Minister, the foreign secretary is sick. Where do you think we could find someone to spout earnest truisms at the peace conference?\" \"Hold on, I think I saw a kid reading the New Statesman and nodding yesterday!\" As a private individual, it's probably not worth having a foreign policy of your own at all. Not unless you own at least a small boat with which to try to effect it. Probably two boats is the minimum, actually. And a gun. Really, all you need to be a functioning citizen is a basic package of beliefs. If you can determine your overall view of human life and society, I think you can henceforth pass by the news pages of newspapers and periodicals, chanting to yourself, \"Not my department,\" and flick on to the transfer speculation and stuff about what kind of nuts might stop you from getting ear cancer. And since voting is the only way most of us are going to be practically able to influence the course of national events, this is the only decision you really need to make. My highly partial political ready-reckoner would go like this: if you basically think we're all in this together, you're Labour. If you basically think we're all in this together, but you're queasy about manslaughter in the Gulf and/or hate Blair's smile, you're Lib Dem. If you totally refute the notion that we're all in this together, you're a dry Tory. If you agree we're all in this together, but think, \"Fuck it, have you seen what they pay in taxes on the continent?\", you're a wet Tory. And if you think we're definitely all in this together, but by \"this\" assume I mean a vicious race war, then you're either BNP or Nation of Islam. Really, I think in the political sphere this is all you need. And if you're walking around with an opinion about the Public Finance Initiative beyond \"Nice acronym. I'm in favour\" or \"What - we give them the hospitals? Sounds weird.\" Then you should really consider whether this is the best use of your brainpower. By way of example, I would note in passing a contestant on Mastermind the other day who had chosen the specialist subject of Dinnerladies, the Victoria Wood sitcom. Now I'm all for taking sitcoms seriously. But I think a line has been crossed when something is deemed a \"specialist subject\" that you could reasonably become an expert on during the course of drinking a six-pack. If you dumped a little current affairs, you could potentially soon be picking up the engraved glass trophy of triumph. Still, I find it very difficult to heed my own advice. I know these opinions that bubble up are distracting from the central aim of life - winning Mastermind - but still they come. Here's a recent example: Live 8. Live 8 was good. It was great. It was a million times better than no Live 8. It was really a good idea and I have nothing but admiration for everyone involved. I just wish I could stop my brain there. That's the headline. That's all that's useful. I don't want to be a doom-monger, a nay-sayer or a piss-hurler. But the opinion-forming part of my brain won't be stopped. It keeps on mentioning that now, five days on, it feels like a pretty weird experience. Though it felt OK at the time, now, when you're faced with the real politics of the G8 on, say, the German desire to attach increased aid to anti-corruption measures, (and in what seems a genuine way), the concert seems something of a blunt political tool. It doesn't really point in any particular policy direction. \"What did the people say on anti-corruption?\" the leaders might ask. Well, the same as on the destruction of rural life in France as a consequence of ending agricultural subsidies: they clapped their hands. Which is always going to be something of an ambiguous political statement. It doesn't offer much beyond the somewhat empty boast: \"Look - we have rhythm!\" The concert is an incredibly difficult to read political lobby. This is why it is so rarely used as a policy-making forum. I believe Holland did toy with \"government by gig\" in the late 70s, but abandoned the project after a series of Bonnie Tyler audiences handed power to a rightwing dictator and prohibited the use of cheese in open sandwiches. But these are all sub-opinions that are essentially useless. I was totally behind Live 8. I don't really want these carpings. It's not as if I ever take any action myself. I usually find that I have such a prissily nuanced set of policy opinions that I am absolved of the need to join any mass demonstration, as they never fit exactly with my beliefs. I forget now exactly what I thought about the war in Iraq before it started - except that it had about 13 subclauses and when I tried to explain it to my writing partner, he would pass out with boredom and ruin our scripts with his pool of dribble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
