The first match of the Champions League was played on 28 July 2009 - a total of 328 days later. Has any other club team ever had to endure a longer wait between qualifying for and actually playing in an international tournament?\" \"The A-League runs from August until February, with the ACL kicking off in March. However, Australia's two qualifiers do not take part in the edition of the ACL that begins just a month after the league finishes \u2013 they qualify for the next tournament,\" writes Stuart Horton. \"The first two Australian teams to qualify for the ACL were Sydney FC and Adelaide United. Sydney secured qualification by winning the first A-League grand final on 5 March 2006. They took part in their first ACL outing on 12 March 2007, some 372 days after qualifying. Adelaide, however, secured their spot by winning the minor premiership on 21 January \u2013 414 days before their debut bow in the ACL.\" Melbourne Victory had an even longer wait. After wrapping up ACL qualification by beating New Zealand Knights on 17 December 2006 they did not play their first Champions League game until 12 March 2008, which, we reckon is 450, even if Davidde Corran (who counts 452) and Nicholas Clifton (451) have other ideas. The ACL, though, doesn't have a monpoly on this sort of nonsense. The Copa Libertadores is also guilty. Tim Dockery suggests the 455 days between Independiente (Avellaneda) qualifying for the 1974 tournament by winning the previous year's trophy on 6 June 1973 and beginning their defence of the cup on 4 September 1974. \"Boca Juniors qualified for Copa Libertadores 2005 (2004-05 season) by winning Apertura 2003 (2003-04 season) with a 2-1 away win over Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed on 27 November 2003,\" writes Tom Baker. \"They played their first game in Copa Libertadores 2005 on 17 February 2005 against Deportivo Cuenca, making a 448-day wait by my calculations.\" The longest wait for a club side, however (if we discard Wayne Lovett's suggestion of the Heysel-enforced nine years Norwich City waited between qualifying for the Uefa Cup in 1985 and actually playing in it 1993), we turn to the World Club Championship. Michael Hewitt points to the 498 days between Vasco de Gama qualifying for the 2000 version by winning the Copa Libertadores on 26 August 1998 and playing their first game against South Melbourne on 6 January 2000. The clubs' waits pale into insignificance when compared to their international counterparts, however. \"The countries participating in the 2009 Fifa Confederations Cup qualified well in advance of that tournament,\" writes Jason Batchelor. Iraq won the AFC Asian Cup on 30 July 2007 (a wait of 685 days), Brazil won the Copa America on 17 July 2007 (689 days), the USA won the Concacaf Gold Cup on 25 June 2007 (720 days) and Italy won the World Cup on 9 July 2006 (1,071 days). Tim Dockery, however, points out that Italy have waited far longer than that before. \"While not exactly answering the question, I will venture that the record for qualifying for, and actually playing in, an international tournament is 12 years and six days,\" he writes. \"Having won the World Cup on 19 June 1938, Italy qualified as the defending champion for the next World Cup and debuted in that edition on 25 June 1950.\" FOUNDING FATHERS \"Seven founding members of the Football League are in the Premier League this year (Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton, Burnley, Everton, Stoke, Wolves), is this a record for the Premier League?\" asks Grant Park. \"Seven out of the 11 still in existence seems pretty good. When was the last time eight founding members graced the top flight and when were all 11 (excluding Accrington FC) last in Division One?\" The founding members of the Football League were, of course, Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Derby, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. First Football League season in 1888-89 dominated by Preston. No relegation in that first season, but Stoke, who had finished bottom in the inaugral campaign, did not escape the following year and were replaced by Sunderland for the 1890-91 season. The Potters returned for 1891-92, giving the league a full complement of the founding 12 once more. In 1892-93 the second division was created and Notts County were relegated at the end of the season. By the time they returned in 1897-98, Accrington had departed (resigning from the league in 1893), but the team who really let the side down were Burnley who dropped out of the top flight in 1899-1900 and did not return until 1913-14 by which point everything had got very confused. So the last time all 12 were in the top flight was 1892-93 and the last time 11 were up there was 1898-99. As for the trickier task of finding the most recent time eight, the latest example we can come up with is 1952-53 when Preston, Wolves, West Brom, Burnley, Bolton, Aston Villa, Stoke and Derby all graced the First Division. THE MOST KIT SPONSORS (2) Last week we took a look at some of the clubs overloading their shirts with sponsors, and since then we've had another couple of suggestions. Lu\u00eds Guilherme Izycki brings us news of some cracking efforts from South America, including the look for cool kids in the Bolivian city of Potos\u00ed this year, the Colombian team \u2013 Atletico Huila \u2013 who appear to have nicked the Tour de France's yellow jersey (with added sponsors) for their kit and finally Ronaldo's very own team, Corinthians, who need 784 sponsors to pay the portly striker's wages. Rickie McNeil recalls that Celtic once sponsored themselves while they were searching for a new deal, while companies and individuals can pay \u00a31,000 to have their name emblazoned on this year's Derry City shirt. Derry reckon they have room for 51 names as well as the 1989 and 2009 squads. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Which was the last team to win the English top flight playing in a striped home kit?\" asked Stuart Young in 2007. Well Stuart, it basically all depends on how discerning you are about your stripes. Obviously we're not going to count teams with a few skinny lines down their sleeves and shorts, nor indeed will we accept Blackburn's half-and-half blue and white blocks, but would you accept the alternating shades of red on Arsenal's title-winning top from 1988-89? If not then the white pinstripes Liverpool sported during their triumphant 1983-84 campaign (and indeed in 1982-83), are a little more clear cut. But if you'll only settle for wholehearted, chunky, even slices of markedly different colours, then you actually have to go all the way back to 1935-36, when Sunderland won the old first division in their traditional red and white. For hundreds more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.
