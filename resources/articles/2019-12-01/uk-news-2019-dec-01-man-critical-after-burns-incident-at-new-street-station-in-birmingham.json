Paramedics, police and firefighters were called after reports that a man had been seriously injured at Birmingham New Street station on Sunday at about 8am. A British Transport Police spokeswoman said that paramedics and police had arrived quickly at the scene and treated the man for \u201cburns injuries\u201d. \u201cAt this early stage it\u2019s believed he came into contact with the overhead power lines,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has been taken to hospital where his condition is described as life-threatening. The circumstances of the man receiving his injuries at this time are not believed to be suspicious.\u201d Platforms were closed while emergency services responded to the incident, causing travel disruption until about 10am. National Rail had said on its website: \u201cEmergency services are currently dealing with an incident at Birmingham New Street. Consequently, there are a reduced number of platforms at the station, and this means that trains may be cancelled, delayed or revised.\u201d The station has since reopened and services are running as normal, police said. One person, calling himself Davey boy, posted on Twitter that he saw a \u201cman on fire\u201d at the station. Another, named Hannah, reported seeing six ambulances, police, the fire brigade and an air ambulance. Footage circulating on social media appears to show an air ambulance landing in the station\u2019s car park on Sunday morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
