Well, finding more may not help", "bodyText": "Last month, New York all but banned private cars from 14th Street, a major thoroughfare in Manhattan, in an effort to let buses travel faster. The city\u2019s permanently aggrieved car lobby \u2013 loud when leaning pointlessly on their horns, equally loud when complaining they\u2019re hard done by \u2013 predicted chaos. They warned that the traffic would be displaced to narrower nearby streets, thereby just shifting the problem, or making it worse. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, though. The reason is a reverse version of \u201cinduced demand\u201d , the phenomenon whereby making roads wider, in an effort to ease congestion, attracts more traffic, eliminating the benefits. (There\u2019s a 26-lane highway outside Houston, Texas, probably the world\u2019s widest road, where evening commute times increased by 55% in the years following an expansion.) So, when capacity is reduced, as on 14th Street, it follows that demand will fall. The logic here isn\u2019t hard to see \u2013 provide more of something, or charge less for it, and people will use more of it \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to overlook how many areas of life it affects. One well-known example is electricity usage, where the Jevons paradox explains how making appliances more energy efficient can backfire by stimulating demand. It\u2019s massively cheaper, and kinder to the environment, to keep a bottle of milk cool in 2019 than it was in 1940, but the result isn\u2019t that we use less electricity on refrigeration: it\u2019s that people buy bigger fridges, or multiple fridges, and that more people lower down the global income ladder have fridges to begin with. This brings many benefits, but lower energy consumption isn\u2019t among them. Less obviously, the same issue afflicts struggles with email overload: get more efficient at processing email, and you\u2019re effectively reducing the cost to others of emailing you, so it\u2019s more likely they will. Work expands to fill the time available \u2013 which is why people who transform themselves into 26-lane highways of productivity often find they\u2019re no less busy than before. Even the relationship dynamic known as \u201coverfunctioning and underfunctioning\u201d is a disguised case of induced demand. If you\u2019re the overfunctioner in your house \u2013 the one who always cleans the kitchen, otherwise it won\u2019t get done \u2013 you\u2019re keeping down the price of not cleaning it, from your partner\u2019s perspective, thus reinforcing their decision not to bother. And should you find a way to do it faster, so it eats less of your time, you\u2019ll be actively reducing the price, making it even more likely you\u2019ll find yourself cleaning the kitchen tomorrow, or next year. What to do? The rule of thumb is: just because your problem is one of strained capacity, don\u2019t assume increasing capacity is the answer. It may make more sense to emulate 14th Street and reduce, or at least put a ceiling on, your capacity instead. Resolve to process email for a certain period each day, rather than trying to answer it all, and you\u2019ll moderate the incoming flow. Stop cleaning the kitchen for a week, and your partner may reach a threshold of disgust and pick up the mop themselves. And so on. Beware the struggle to \u201cget everything done\u201d, which is equivalent to the struggle to make space for every driver who wants to use a given stretch of road; often, the result is just to increase the size of the \u201ceverything\u201d.
