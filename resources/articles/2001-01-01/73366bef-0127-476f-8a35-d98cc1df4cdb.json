But the commission will leave a lasting, lottery-funded legacy - a \u00a3100m endowment fund, the interest from which will continue the millennium awards scheme. The commission is about to hand over the cash to a curious consortium called un LTD. This is a remarkable victory for an organisation which came together last summer, but this is just the beginning of its grand ambitions. Michael Norton, chairman of Changemakers, one of the consortium partners, which works to engage young people in community affairs, says: \"We believe that the potential of individuals to create change in their communities is limited only by their ideas and their energy.\" The winning organisation wants to build on the experience of the millennium awards, but to go well beyond the scheme's limited aim of giving small, one-off grants to individuals to fund pet projects ranging from inventor workshops to medieval fairs. The watchword is social enterprise, a notion which raises eyebrows in some quarters because of the suspicion that it is a euphemism for privatising public services, an excuse for cutting spending. But un LTD sees it as it was defined recently by the social investment taskforce: using conventional business disciplines, tools and entrepreneurial skills to achieve a social purpose. It is a new twist on traditional business philanthropy, such as the social housing built in the 19th century by the Cadbury family for workers at its factory in Bournville. The modern notion of social enterprise escapes such reliance on the generosity of business owners. Instead, it is about getting community activists to use business methods, rather than vice versa. In particular, it involves thinking about investment - implying sustainable finance, rather than relying on grants which need replacing. Most of the seven partners in the consortium have solid community credentials. They include the Scarman Trust, the School for Social Entrepreneurs, Community Action Network, and Senscot, the Scottish network for social entrepreneurs. Comic Relief makes an unlikely addition to this mix and the seventh member is Ashoka, an international organisation founded in the US in 1989. In fact, Ashoka brought together these groups - which are, in some respects, competitors. Jeremy Oppenheim, Ashoka's UK chairman, has a direct link to the business world because his day job is as a senior management consultant at McKinsey - to many the epitome of private sector, profit-driven efficiency. Such a connection may fuel concerns about the implications of social enterprise. But Oppenheim makes clear that social entrepreneurs are pursuing public, not financial, goals. He argues that they can benefit from private sector approaches, and, to prove it, the global consultancy last year set up a not-for-profit team within the business, just as it has a pharmaceutical team and a food team. Ashoka was founded by a former McKinsey consultant, which explains the connection. It draws a parallel between its strategy of backing social entrepreneurs with financial venture capital practices. David Cope, its chief executive, says: \"Ashoka invests in outstanding individuals leading projects of direct benefit to society. They have to be innovative and have considerable potential impact.\" Ashoka has not been active in this way in Britain, but there are now 1,100 such Ashoka \"fellows\" in 40 countries. The organisation backs them with a modest salary for two or three years while their projects get off the ground, but it places as much emphasis on the advice and support from the international network of fellows. This model is part of how un LTD will manage the millennium awards scheme, which it describes as a \"staircase approach\". The first step will broadly follow the pattern so far - small grants of up to \u00a32,500 to individuals with good ideas for community action. The second step on the un LTD staircase will break with previous practice and offer further grants to people who have completed their projects (who become fellows) but see the scope for significant development. Up to \u00a315,000 from the endowment interest will be available each year for about 100 such fellows. It is also intended to make more of the fellowship than in the past. The fellows have learned important lessons, and the aim is to make their experience available to new award winners. Then un LTD aims to move beyond the commission's funding. It plans a third step of \"significant\" investment for the best projects. This money - the target is \u00a3100m - will come from wealthy individuals who have been dubbed \"venture philanthropists\". They are the new rich, the dot.com millionaires and others who helped inflate the wealth bubble during the 1990s. The theory is that they can be just as charitable as previous generations, but they want something more than the traditional foundation. First, they want to be more involved than grant-giving bodies normally allow. Second, instead of just giving their money away they want some kind of financial return, even if that is just getting their capital back. This is where the McKinsey connection could show its worth. Already Oppenheim has organised a few meetings, seeking to bring together these nouveaux riches with people looking for backing for their social ventures. There is another private sector analogy - the First Tuesday gatherings which helped marry internet entrepreneurs and those with money to invest in their dreams. Oppenheim talks of \"creating the next generation of community leaders\" and having 10,000 \"active citizens\" in the fellowship at the end of five years. And, of course, he is also looking for a major change in regeneration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
