The cause of my sudden moment of moral disgust has been the discovery that the New York Times fraudster, Jayson Blair, sold his memoirs Burning Down My Master's House (an extract of which was published in last Saturday's Guardian magazine) for what his publisher described as a \"mid-six-figure advance\". If \"mid-six-figure\" means anything, it must mean around half a million dollars was paid for a book that was written in a few months, and reads like it was completed in a few days. Blair, you may remember, was the young journalist who brought down the editor of the New York Times, when it was discovered that he had been making up parts of his stories and plagiarising others. Supposedly ruined, he may now have earned more from his lying than many of his colleagues garner in half a decade of telling the truth. The Anne Atkins Thought (named in honour of the radio scourge of modern morals) is that supplied by New York Times columnist Clyde Haberman, when he said of the Blair deal, \"We're living in a society that rewards inexcusable behaviour. We seem to have lost our capacity for shame.\" Is this fair? The lad is, perhaps, a moralist himself. Says Blair in the book's introduction, \"I want the opportunity to share my story.\" Sod the money and the fame, it's the sharing. As he told our own Gary Younge, good may come of it. \"In some ways my scandal could do for journalism what Watergate did to the presidency.\" So he accepts the advance not just for his sake, or even our sake, but for a much greater cause. I feel some sympathy for Blair, in that he does indeed seem to have been struggling with manic depression. The Times itself, in its magisterial review of all Blair's crimes last May, agreed that \"the audacity of the deceptions ... suggest[ed] the work of a troubled young man veering toward professional self-destruction.\" By all accounts the paper's management went to some lengths to assist Blair in getting the help he needed to overcome addiction and depression. Even so, there is something rather repulsive about the way in which Blair accepts responsibility almost as a tactic to deflect real blame, and then tries somehow to suggest that the true decisions lay elsewhere. Like, \"Somewhere along the way, like so many people struggling to survive the realities of life, I lost my moorings.\" But what realities was Blair struggling to survive? Being a well-paid reporter on a prestigious newspaper, where he clearly had the ear of the management? Does this sound like something that should test one's basic moral values? Primo Levi wouldn't think so. Or try this. \"Although I am alive by the skin of my teeth, I am destined to become another one of them, a tale of a promising young reporter who came to the Times with energy and talent, who somehow lost it, and lost everything.\" Somehow? The same \"somehow\" that appears in his account of an early falsification, the big concert that he didn't attend? \"I had every intention of going, but somehow found myself at a party at an assistant foreign editor's house on the Upper West Side.\" Was he kidnapped and given Rohypnol? Or, to show where such a train of logic goes to, his encounter with a young man, convicted of two murders, who \"reminded me of so many of my own family members - young, intelligent, charming black men who somehow found themselves in prison\". Well, two murders might explain it. Ten quid, incidentally, to the first person who provides a full count of the somehows of Jayson Blair. So, there's \"somehow\", and then there's \"he did it too\". \"I started with attempts to garner the truth,\" Blair told Younge, \"and then just started cutting corners when I couldn't get the truth.\" Or, \"The story that the Pentagon built up around (Jessica) Lynch fitted in to those same stereotypes, and it was as fake as anything I had ever written.\" In a lying world, who can say what the truth is? Blair was corrupted. And it's a pity, because Blair, disillusioned with the cutthroat world of national newspapers, had been planning to go to Africa, where his mission would have been to \"use journalism, human rights work, volunteering and other pursuits to better peoples' lives in small ways and to promote social change\". Had he turned down the glamorous and lucrative NYT job, Jayson might be in Mozambique right now, helping out. Alas. Maybe he will go now. But the Blair phrase that really stuck in my head was the one extracted from him by Younge. \"I just don't believe,\" said Jayson about his book, \"that because you're ashamed about something, you don't have the right to speak.\" So what the hell is shame, then? Wasn't that the Hindley problem, that by constantly asking for her release, she convinced many of us that she wasn't ashamed enough to be freed? When is it OK to punch a lover-rat? So, James Hewitt, infamous Diana love-rat, has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a photographer outside his home in South Kensington. Hewitt's home, that is, which prompted the following thought: should there be such a crime as the one that Hewitt is suspected of committing? Outside the photographer's home, no argument. That would be assault. But after having listened to people in the news talking about how they are sometimes treated by photographers, what it's like to have lenses and flashguns stuck in your and your family's faces, to find big blokes with ladders leaning over your garden wall, to be crowded and jostled, well, it sounds weird, unnerving and intimidating. If anyone without a camera did that to you, you'd get the police to charge them with stalking. \"Ah yes,\" says a colleague. \"But if you're going to legalise the hitting of photographers, then what about journalists who are doorstepping people?\" Good question. Should folk be permitted to pummel Donal McIntyre or Roger Cook? Obviously not. This dilemma might be solved by a \"not in the public interest\" defence, in which the accused could argue that the story on which the photographer or journalist was embarked, far from being a bit of fearless investigation, was in fact yet another tacky, gossipy load of tabloid nonsense. The problem for Hewitt is that, in arguing such a defence, he would have to explain just why the photographer was pandering to such ghastliness, and Hewitt was not. Let us recall his book, Love and War, and ponder that, on second thought, maybe we should all be allowed to hit Hewitt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
