The League received an official complaint from Southampton, who were unhappy with the way Portsmouth went about getting their former manager back. And, having considered the circumstances surrounding the 58-year-old's return to Fratton Park, the FA has now decided to charge Pompey. A Premier League statement read: \"The Board of the Premier League received an official complaint from Southampton surrounding the departure from the club of Harry Redknapp and his subsequent appointment as manager of Portsmouth. Having considered the circumstances, the board has decided to charge Portsmouth FC with breaching the approach rules. A commission will be appointed to deal with the matter.\" Redknapp left the Championship club on December 3, with angry Saints chairman Rupert Lowe insisting at the time he would report the matter to the Premier League. Lowe said: \"As far as I am concerned even if there has not been a breach of rules there has been a breach of courtesy and basic good manners.\" Two days later Southampton turned down an offer of compensation for Redknapp from Portsmouth, describing it as \"derisory\". Redknapp was confirmed as Portsmouth's new manager on December 7. The League indicated yesterday they were ready to lay serious charges against Portsmouth following the 58-year-old's re-appointment last month, which was accompanied by unusual betting patterns with internet bookmakers. But Redknapp said: \"I don't want to talk about that, really. It is a lot of tosh; if they want to investigate it let them if they have nothing better to do, because they will be wasting their time yet again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
