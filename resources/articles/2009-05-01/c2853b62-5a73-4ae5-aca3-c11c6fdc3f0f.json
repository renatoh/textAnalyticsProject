What made Gordon Brown hurl himself on that row of Gurkha kukri knives? Drowning at 19% behind in the latest polls, few think the party will come up for air a third time. That YouTube grinning death's head is now a worldwide comic hit, while in the flesh the man looks more battered and hunted with each passing day. He suffers from tone deafness to everything. \"I don't regret anything I've done!\" Gordon Brown declared at the press conference this week where he was abused for his economic policy by the impudent Polish prime minister, a man himself on his knees to the IMF. That's what happens when the mantle of authority slips. Whose bright idea was it to put out a chirpy press release this week promising a crackdown on rogue wheelclampers, echoing John Major's dying cones hotline? Forced to retreat twice this week from his unilateral YouTube proclamation, the worst is yet to come on MPs' expenses when more shockers will emerge. All parties will be shamed, but the government will be hardest hit: some ministers will be disgraced \u2013 and Labour avarice is always more shocking. No regrets? The 500,000 remaining low-paid losers from Brown's abolition of the 10p tax rate were not compensated in the budget. Worse is to come for them: I hear that the long-delayed announcement on the new rate for the national minimum wage gives them only 4p an hour more, rising to just \u00a35.77 following two bad years of falling behind inflation even in the fat times. Inequality will grow unless the minimum wage rises a bit above inflation every year \u2013 yes, even in the hard years. Meanwhile that 50p top tax rate hangs in the air as a political mystery without a strong redistributive narrative, unpegged to helping those in most need. Where are its vociferous cabinet defenders fighting off absurd threats from the rich? Maybe Brown only regrets the loss of Damian McBride, his toxic confidant \u2013 not a one-off, but one of a thuggish tribe. How far has Labour lost touch with reality when leading figures try to shoehorn a party apparatchik's 22-year-old daughter into a safe seat? Rottenness easily feels terminal. Self-destructive and bungled tactical ploys mark the Brown era: the attempt to secure 42-day detention without trial was the most cynical. But in the end what damages him most is the blame he bears for not only allowing, but celebrating, the great bubble in house prices, City bonuses and wild excess while many warned a bust would come. Look back on the day he stood on the No 10 threshold: \"I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action in the service of what matters to the British people.\" He reprised his school motto \u2013 \"I will do my utmost\" \u2013 and no doubt he did, but it hasn't been enough. After all those angry years in waiting, he should have been mindful of the old saw: be careful what you wish for. Many said he had neither the temperament nor the political skills for the top job. I was among those who hoped he had, because you have to live in hope. How Blair's people gloat \u2013 we told you so! Labour faces such a cataclysmic defeat it could be out of power for many years. Ask the Tories how long it takes to climb back from the abyss. All Labour seats with a majority of under 8,000 are in peril. The Lib Dems may push Labour to third place in June, even to below 20%. Defeatism grips the party: the middle-aged say they've had a good innings, politics goes in cycles and to everything there is a season; half their attention is directed towards a pretty comfortable semi-retirement. The thrusters concentrate on the battle in opposition over the leadership and the nature of the party itself. The young can't imagine quite how bad it will feel. This inert fatalism won't do. Rumblings about removing Brown are wishful thinking in a party too listless to act. The dream scenario is that grey suits tell him to go, he obliges, and that nice Alan Johnson soothes the party through to at least a respectable defeat. Dream on. Brown won't go without assassination, Johnson is no killer (which is what makes him so nice), and many fear the bloody process would cost Labour its last shreds of credibility. Dire June may yet change that calculation: 100 extra Labour MPs fearing for their seats can concentrate minds wonderfully. For now, David Blunkett is right that there are no ideas, no politics and no breath of life left. Where is the serious intellectual attack on the Conservatives? Cameron has just performed a U-turn of breathtaking dimensions. Gone are the hoodie-hugging, husky-driving, go-green and let-the-sunshine-in days, replaced by nothing but hard Thatcherite 1980s promises of austerity and cuts. Look what's coming, and be very afraid. This week a survey on the ConservativeHome website of likely new Tory MPs was an eye-opener. They are socially conservative, anti-environment, anti-Europe, anti-abortion, anti-gay adoption, pro-hunting and strongly in favour of the married couples' allowance that redistributes tax to the middle class. Only 15% see the climate as important: terrorism matters much more. Most want to cut money for Scotland: a Tory win will trigger new support for independence. They are well to the right of their leader, even his tougher guise. Lord Ashcroft, who channels money to favoured marginals, has nurtured a nest of MPs more to his own liking. Labour needs to make sure as few of these as possible reach the Commons. Start with a scorched-earth pre-emption of all the easy cuts the Tories will promise: ID cards first, and the Trident madness, which even Tories now question. David Davis opened a debate on cutting benefits to the well-off that Labour could seize on. Now the old are less likely to be poor, savings can be made on universal payments. Transfer the money to the poorest before the Tories take it and give nothing back. Now I'm 60, why do I get free travel and winter fuel payments while still working? Get in on waste first \u2013 but earmark savings in ways the Tories never would. Seizing the savings initiative might even avoid defeat altogether. Inside No 10 policies still revolve round dead issues \u2013 personalising public services and the like. The crash has changed everything and it needs Labour answers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
