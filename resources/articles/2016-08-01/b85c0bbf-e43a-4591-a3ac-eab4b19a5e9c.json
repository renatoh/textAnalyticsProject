Those who support this view include doctors, teachers, case workers, managers and social workers from Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield), Save the Children, IHMS, Salvation Army and other contracted workers with first-hand experience across both Manus Island and Nauru Regional Processing Centres. They strongly believe that the establishment of another Senate Inquiry in response to the release of the Nauru files is quite simply not enough. \u201cThis has reached crisis level and requires an immediate response.\u201d said Toby O\u2019Brien, former Child Protection Officer with Save the Children. \u201cThe evidence is already overwhelmingly clear.\u201d Many of the former staff have already made submissions and given evidence to a number of inquiries, investigations and reviews. \u201cWe\u2019ve given evidence and it\u2019s been ignored.\u201d said Natasha Reid, Case Manager with Broadspectrum until February 2015, \u201cNo change has occurred for the men we worked with since the last Senate Inquiry. The camp is not safer, conditions have not improved, the physical and mental decline of those held continues.\u201d Charlotte Wilson, who worked in case management on both Nauru and Manus Island over a period of 1.5 years, said \u201cThe Nauru files are damning in their truth, and they are not exclusive to Nauru. The men on Manus are being harmed just as frequently and severely.\u201d \u201cI watched these children\u2019s lives being destroyed by these camps,\u201d said Katie Price, Former Child and Youth Recreation Officer, was employed on Nauru with Save the Children for almost two years. \u201cThey went from energetic, cheeky, normal kids to completely devoid of all emotion. I recall one 7-year-old child towards the end having a complete breakdown. She collapsed, screaming and kicking and crying for 20 minutes, completely incoherent and would not let go of me. \u201c Shivani Keecha, who was the Coordinator of Save the Children\u2019s Child Protection team on Nauru until October 2015, wants to see immediate action taken. \u201cThis cannot continue. I worked on Nauru while several previous investigations and inquiries were held. Nothing changed. It was already too little too late. We don\u2019t need more evidence. We know these centres cause unacceptable harm. We need to bring these people to Australia and start the process of rebuilding their lives.\u2019\u2019 Hayley Ballinger, Unaccompanied Minor Residential Worker and Child Protection Caseworker with Save the Children until April 2015 said \u201cI implore the public and the Government to remember these are people. Kind, ambitious, strong, imaginative, clever, nurturing, loving, real people who are being systemically broken.\u201d \u201cThey are truly the bravest souls I have ever met, and they deserve a future free from further harm.\u201d said Ms Ballinger. Chris Lougheed, Deputy Education Manager with Save the Children, who personally reviewed and submitted a great many incident reports such as those published in the Nauru files, condemned the Minister\u2019s claims that the reports were \u2018hype\u2019 and demanded he took responsibility. \u201cThese reports are accurate observations written by experienced professionals.\u201d \u201cPeople are in immediate danger. Too much time has already passed. The Australian government must take responsibility and bring them here immediately.\u201d said Mr Lougheed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
