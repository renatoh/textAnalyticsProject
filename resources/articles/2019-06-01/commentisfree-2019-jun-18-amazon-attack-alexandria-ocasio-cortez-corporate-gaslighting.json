I don\u2019t mean a tax break; it has had enough of those already. I mean can we please stop bullying the trillion-dollar multinational and its billionaire owner? After all, it is not Jeff Bezos\u2019s fault that he has more money than he knows what to do with. It is not his fault he makes more money in 12 seconds than his lowest-paid employees make in a year. He can\u2019t do anything about that! Nevertheless, people keep criticising the poor guy and suggesting his billions are ill-begotten. In the past, Amazon has weathered criticism quietly. In the past few weeks, though, the company seems to have taken a leaf out of Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter book and has been belligerently calling out its critics. Last week, Joe Biden tweeted that the company ought to pay more tax. Amazon responded by tweeting that it pays \u201cevery penny\u201d it owes and suggesting snarkily that Biden\u2019s complaint was with the US\u2019s tax laws, not the company. On Monday, it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s turn to be lectured. The congresswoman recently told ABC News that she believes Bezos\u2019s billionaire status is partly due to Amazon paying \u201cstarvation wages\u201d and taking \u201cbillions of dollars of government subsidies\u201d. This is nonsense, according to Amazon. It tweeted: \u201cAOC is just wrong. Amazon is a leader on pay at $15 min wage + full benefits from day one. We also lobby to raise federal min wage.\u201d Amazon didn\u2019t stop there. Jay Carney, its head of communication, was so incensed by his paymaster\u2019s reputation being besmirched that he tweeted: \u201cI\u2019d urge @AOC to focus on raising the federal minimum wage instead of making stuff up about Amazon.\u201d I know it is fashionable to call anything you don\u2019t agree with FAKE NEWS, but it is bizarre for Carney to claim Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cmaking stuff up\u201d when there is plenty of evidence Bezos\u2019s billions are derived in part from exploiting workers, avoiding tax and raking in government subsidies. According to data collected by the advocacy group Good Jobs First, Amazon has received nearly $2.5bn in US government subsidies. It is also well documented that thousands of Amazon employees have had to rely on food stamps and are frequently worked so hard that they don\u2019t have time to take toilet breaks. Then there is the fact that Amazon has fought taxes that would raise money for homelessness services. And the fact that it issues credit cards with a 28% interest rate to people with poor credit. To be fair, Amazon is correct that it pays its staff at least $15 an hour, but that is a new development \u2013 the company only raised its minimum wage last autumn, because of enormous political pressure. Bernie Sanders, for example, introduced a bill called the Stop Bezos Act that would tax employers if their staff require federal benefits. The audacity of Amazon positioning itself as a benevolent activist is jawdropping. It is even more jawdropping that Carney has the temerity to tell Ocasio-Cortez that she is \u201cmaking stuff up\u201d. And it is downright insulting to tell her she ought to spend her time focusing on trying to raise the federal minimum wage when she has been doing just that. Amazon\u2019s attacks on the congresswoman aren\u2019t just unfounded; they are a prime example of corporate gaslighting. Whatever you do, don\u2019t buy it.
