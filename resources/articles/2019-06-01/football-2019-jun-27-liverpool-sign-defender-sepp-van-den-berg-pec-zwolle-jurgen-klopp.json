The 17-year-old centre-back, who was coveted by Ajax and Bayern Munich this summer, will cost the Champions League winners an initial \u00a31.3m. The fee could rise to \u00a34.4m should he make a substantial number of Premier League and European appearances. Van den Berg is not being signed as an academy player by Liverpool but as a young talent who can be developed at first-team level under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. His is the first deal struck by Liverpool this transfer window and he will complete his move on 1 July. Speaking to Liverpool\u2019s website, Van den Berg said: \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. It is, for me, the biggest club in the world and it\u2019s a dream come true. I am really excited. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, I thought it was a joke. To be honest, I was a little bit scared at first because such a big club had interest in me. I think this is the best place for me to grow and hopefully play a lot of games here. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what kind of players from the academy have grown into the first team. [Klopp] is a great guy and one of the reasons they are successful \u2013 and also one of the reasons I came here. I was thinking about [the idea of] training with Virgil [van Dijk]. For me he is the best defender in the world, so I can learn a lot from him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
