The long-running issue resurfaced in federal parliament this week after new evidence from the Australian National Audit Office implicated the prime minister\u2019s office in authorising the grants.

Australia Fossil fuel concerns have prompted Norway\u2019s gigantic sovereign wealth fund to dump its stake in the Australian energy company AGL, with BHP put on an \u201cobservation list\u201d suggesting major divestment could occur in the future. The Norwegian central bank, which manages the US$1.1tn Government Pension Fund Global, dumped its $65m stake in AGL, following stricter rules about its investment in fossil fuels. Eleven Australian banks and lenders have paid out $160m in compensation over \u201cjunk\u201d insurance sold to more than 434,000 credit card customers and other borrowers.

After a lost decade embroiled in climate wars, writes Adam Morton, it\u2019s not just climate activists, but industry, banks, energy companies, unions and major investors agitating for a fresh approach. Pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania\u2019s high country but, with climate change rendering the trees too stressed to seed, a two-man mission is harvesting by hand to give the 150m-years-old Gondwana-era plants a chance to thrive, writes Calla Wahlquist. Even before the pandemic struck, wages in Australia were struggling, and that\u2019s before we see what effect a sudden surge in unemployment will have, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cAt this point we should perhaps pause and say a small eulogy for the wage-growth predictions in December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook.

WA\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan, has offered to use his contacts inside the Chinese government to help Scott Morrison avoid a trade war, writes the West Australian, amid fears the state\u2019s mining sector could lose out. And house prices could collapse by a third over three years depending on the severity of unemployment caused by Covid-19, says the Sydney Morning Herald. Coming up A report from the Lowy Institute to be released today suggests 59% of Australians trust the prime minister as a preferred source of Covid-19 information.

And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 St\u00e9phane Bourgoin has written more than 40 books and is regarded as a leading authority on serial killers \u2013 except that he made it all up. No, he hasn\u2019t interviewed more than 70 murderers, he never trained with the FBI, and no \u2013 a serial killer didn\u2019t murder his wife in 1976, for the simple fact: she never existed. \u201cI am profoundly and sincerely sorry.
