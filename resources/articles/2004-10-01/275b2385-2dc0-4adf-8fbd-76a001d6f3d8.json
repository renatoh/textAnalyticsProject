The word begins with an S. It contains five easily pronounced letters. Even David Beckham is smart enough to grasp when it is needed. You do not require a Catholic priest to hear this confession. In fact, the more publicly you are penitent, the better it would be. Sorry surely doesn't have to be the hardest word. Conquer your pride, apologise for Iraq, get it over with and let everyone finally move on. Such is the deceptive advice offered to Tony Blair by foe and friend alike. An act of contrition is urged on the Prime Minister by opponents hoping to salami-slice his authority. It has also been recommended by some of his allies in the belief that only a display of prime ministerial self-flagellation can purge the damage done to the government. The reasoning of those who want to hear that sorry sounds superficially plausible. The war may not be the most decisive factor in the minds of a majority of the electorate, but it matters a lot to an important and angry minority of natural Labour supporters. They may vent that fury by sitting on their hands at the next election or by registering an anti-war protest with the Liberal Democrats, especially when the risk of inadvertently electing a Tory government seems so remote. One of the Prime Minister's most senior officials estimates that Iraq could depress Labour's share of the vote at the next election by 5 per cent. That could make a massive difference to the outcome. Number 10 is preoccupied with finding a way of giving these lost supporters 'a way home', as one of Mr Blair's strategists puts it. So what's needed, it's argued, is an act of atonement. Those pressing the apologetic approach on the Prime Minister have occasionally thought they had overcome his resistance. On the eve of the Labour Party conference, The Observer went to interview the Prime Minister at Chequers. I've subsequently learnt that there was a lively debate between Mr Blair and his advisers about a form of words he could deploy in the interview to indicate contrition for making the case for war on the basis of a threat from weapons of mass destruction that, we now know, did not exist. When it came to it, he could not bring himself to stick to the formula. Mr Blair told us: 'I have been very happy to take full responsibility for information that has turned out to be wrong. It's absolutely right that, as we've already done, we've apologised to people for the information that was given being wrong.' When we came away, we scratched our heads about his use of the past tense. The Prime Minister had not previously apologised for the intelligence being wrong. He had expressed to us a (sort of) contrition, only to diminish it by claiming not to be saying anything he hadn't said before. I assume he could not bear the thought of the headline: Blair: I Was Wrong. Something similar happened at the conference itself. The word 'sorry' was originally in the text of his conference speech, only to be excised by the Prime Minister at the very last moment. 'I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong,' he ended up saying to his audience in Brighton, which is not quite the same as saying that he is sorry. By the time of Prime Minister's Question Time last Wednesday, the ground appeared to have been laid for Tony Blair finally to give that unequivocal sorry. Jack Straw made an unanticipated statement to the Commons in which he announced that the most notoriously wrong assertion about Saddam's capabilities, the claim that he could launch biological and chemical weapons in 45 minutes, had been formally 'withdrawn' by the director-general of SIS. Charlie Falconer, Peter Hain and Patricia Hewitt had broadcast apologies about the faulty intelligence. The Prime Minister, though, still choked on the s-word. 'Will he now say sorry?' demanded Michael Howard. Mr Blair responded: 'I take full responsibility and, indeed, apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong. That is entirely proper; I have already done that.' He was again using the past tense he deployed with us in The Observer interview. He rendered his apology a non-apology by insisting it was an apology he had already made. He was regretting that the intelligence was wrong, but still not apologising for the way it was used to build his case for the removal of Saddam. Why could he not take up Michael Howard's suggestion that 'he can move on' if only he would use that simple word sorry? Because, for Mr Blair, sorry is not a simple word. It is a very dangerous one. There is more than vanity, stubborness or megalomania in the explanation for why he won't express regret. An apology would not assuage the opponents of the war. They would not reward self-abasement by the Prime Minister with praise for his honesty. They would seize on it as the final admission from the man himself that he took Britain into a terribly misjudged conflict on a false prospectus. They would be refuelled in their demands for his head. Second, there is no good reason to suppose that apologising would rebuild trust in Mr Blair and plenty of reason to reckon that it would badly weaken him. Enemy would be delighted, and friend would despair. It would be especially devastating to the morale of those Labour MPs who voted for the war and have stuck with him, as most have, through it all. Next, it would be to concede that his opponents have now completely won the argument against the war when they have not. Mr Blair has been compelled to shift his justifications for removing Saddam. The best the Prime Minister can now argue is that the Iraqi dictator had an 'intent' to reacquire weapons of mass destruction. But the final report of the Iraq Survey Group also does damage to the anti-war case. The ISG confirmed Saddam's obsession with possessing WMD as well as his use of bribery directed at the United Nations, France, Russia and China to wreck the sanctions regime. At the very least, this raises doubts whether a containment policy was as sustainable as opponents of the war have maintained. What Michael Howard wanted from Tony Blair was an apology because he had 'misrepresented the intelligence'. The Tory leader asked for this concession because he knew the Prime Minister would be self-destructive to grant it. Agreeing to the proposition that he had knowingly misrepresented the intelligence to the House of Commons would be fatal. That is a resignation offence. If he made that concession, the Prime Minister would indeed 'move on': he would have to move on out of Downing Street. Tony Blair's motives for going to war are now pretty much transparent. Merely 'the possibility' of Saddam possessing WMD was sufficient grounds for action in his most recent account to MPs. America was determined on war and, in his calculation, it would be more perilous for the world if the US acted alone. The dictator's regime was vile, the latest example of its detestability being provided by the first forensic excavation of a mass grave in northern Iraq, from which the bodies of blindfolded women, some with babies in their arms, have been exhumed. It was Charles Kennedy who provoked from Tony Blair the starkest confirmation yet that the war ultimately came down to regime change. 'I took the choice. I stand by it,' said the Prime Minister. Had the Liberal Democrats had their way, 'Saddam Hussein and his sons would still be running Iraq. That is the case and that is why I took the stand that I did. I take it now and I at least will stick by it'. The most basic reason why Tony Blair won't say sorry is that he isn't."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
