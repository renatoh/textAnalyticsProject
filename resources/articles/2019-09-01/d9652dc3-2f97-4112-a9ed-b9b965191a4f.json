He is scheduled to holds talks with Donald Tusk, the European council president at the UN general assembly (UNGA), as well as having joint discussions with Emmanuel Macron of France and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, and a meeting with Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar. Other bilateral meetings for Johnson include with Donald Trump, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern, Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the comedian-turned-politician who became Ukraine\u2019s president in April, and King Abdullah II of Jordan. With the trip already expected to be potentially interrupted by the supreme court ruling on whether Johnson was lawful in suspending parliament, his meetings with EU leaders will face intense scrutiny over signs of any emerging Brexit compromise. It will be a first chance for Tusk and others to interrogate Johnson personally on the draft ideas for a possible solution to resolving a hard Irish border outlined by the UK government earlier this week, amid signs of continued EU scepticism on the issue. Among a series of speeches and remarks due to be made by the PM, he will use a breakfast meeting of US and UK businesses to, as a senior government official put it, \u201cmake the pitch for why investing in Britain post-Brexit is a great thing to do\u201d. Amid efforts to play down the significance of the UNGA meetings on the departure process, the official called the talks \u201cpart of the ongoing Brexit talks\u201d, to be viewed in conjunction with continuing discussions between officials. \u201cWhat this gives the PM an opportunity to do is talk to them at leader level about what some of our proposals are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time we\u2019re under no illusions that there is an awful lot of work still to do, and you should view the discussions at UNGA as part of an ongoing process.\u201d The official added: \u201cObviously the PM will be able to talk through the ideas which we have for replacing the backstop, and if the leaders are asking the PM questions I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be very happy to talk about what our thinking is.\u201d In brief comments by Johnson released in advance of the trip, for which he will arrive on Sunday and leave on Wednesday, the PM said he would discuss \u201cthree crucial issues\u201d at the gathering. \u201cFirst, how Britain can work with our European and American allies on peace and stability in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, how science and new technologies can help the world deal with climate change and the threats to biodiversity. Third, how post-Brexit Britain will be a better place to invest in and live in.\u201d Among ministers also attending will be Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, and the international development secretary, Alok Sharma. Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, will also be at the conference, but not in any official No 10 capacity \u2013 she is attending as part of her work with an environmental charity. The discussions on the Middle East will focus heavily on a potential international response to drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities, which the US has blamed on Iran. In return, Iran\u2019s foreign minister has said any attack on his country would result in \u201call-out war\u201d. Johnson will also make his set-piece speech to the general assembly on Tuesday evening local time, billed as taking in the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence, as well as \u201cBritish values\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
