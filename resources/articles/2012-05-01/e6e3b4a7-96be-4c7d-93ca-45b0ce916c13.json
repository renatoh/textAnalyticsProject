The track's new in-house betting operation, meanwhile, came through its first significant test as smoothly as anyone at the course could have wished, no doubt adding to the gloom at BetFred, the new owners of the Tote, as they prepared to pay out on the Premier League title for the second time in two months. In some quarters, it was seen \u2013 somewhat euphemistically \u2013 as a \"brave\" decision when Chester and Bangor opted to evict the newly privatised Tote from their property and go it alone. There was criticism, too, when it transpired that the payouts \u2013 since BetFred also acquired a seven\u2011year monopoly on pool betting, and would sue in an instant if it thought that Chester were running a pool \u2013 would be at starting price, less 10%. The belief seemed to be that punters using Chester's new betting windows were being ripped off, and that the track should be ashamed for exploiting them so cynically. While I have no truck with backers being scammed, however, on the basis that fair, consistent treatment and low margins are the best way to keep them coming back, in this instance, I struggle to see the problem. Quite the opposite, in fact. Chester should be applauded for acknowledging that racing and betting are inextricably linked, and then taking charge of a vital revenue stream rather than leave it for someone else to exploit. It is not as if the on-course punters do not have a choice. The betting ring may be in thrall to Betfair these days, but it still offers the chance not simply to bet at SP, but to beat it too. Even in the crowds at the May meeting, it's no more than a five-minute walk to a good old-fashioned bookmaker from pretty much anywhere on the track. In these days of smartphones, meanwhile, the high street names, and Betfair too, are just a few taps away. You could even use a phone to bet into the Tote pools should you be that way inclined. Not, of course, that many British punters are. Pools work well when they have a monopoly but do not like competition, and the UK market is the most competitive on the planet. If more than one on-course Tote customer in 20 at last year's May meeting used the windows because they wanted a pool bet, rather than because it was the easiest option, it would be a considerable surprise. It's about convenience, and convenience costs. Perhaps 5% would be a fairer rate than 10%, but it's hardly the rip off that some would suggest. When comparing returns against SP, in fact, it's more likely that backers would feel cheated by an odds-on Tote return about a 6-4 favourite. Chester's move is a small step, but a significant one all the same because the punters are now betting directly with the racecourse rather than via an intermediary. There are many in racing who like to claim that bookmakers are the sport's customers, rather than the people who place the bets, but few, if any, of them have any understanding of betting beyond a belief that it somehow owes racing a living with no strings attached. Chester's example shows that, with a little imagination, it is possible to shake off the us-and-them mentality that is so deeply ingrained in racing and betting. If the same type of forward-thinking could be applied to off-course punters too, then sport really would be in business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
