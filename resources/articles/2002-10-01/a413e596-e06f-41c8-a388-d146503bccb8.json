LR: There's lots. It's a really tough process. People want you and your work but they'll say, \"Oh, can you change that? Can you get some movie stars in?\" But what they don't realise is that that changes the work a lot, so that can be tough. I hate it when it takes three years to make a film and the distribution... You're not making a film to project in your backroom. You have to think... It's like chess. It can be stressful, but it's also quite exciting. The shoot's quite tough, that's 24/7. The only chance you get to be alone is when you eat, so I put on a stone in the last shoot because I wanted to get away from everybody asking me questions every two minutes. But it's also an adrenaline high, so it's a love-hate thing. Q: Do you read your criticism? Does it scare you? LR: The shoots are the best thing in some ways because you have to make a decision on the spot, there's no way out - it's like someone's got a gun to your head. I tend not to read anything because you get scared by the identity that gets written about you that isn't actually you. The next film I'm doing is called Lovely Bones, which is a book we optioned before it came out and it became a bestseller in America recently. Suddenly you get a barrage of phone calls saying, \"Gee, we really loved Ratcatcher!\" I'm cynical enough to know that the American agents are calling because we've got a bestseller on our hands. You've got to keep your feet on the ground or you go crazy. I don't want to become a director for hire. Q: How much did it cost? LR: It was just under \u00a33m, which is considered low budget here. Low budget is probably considered to be about \u00a34m. Most of the money went on location, because we wanted continuity with the crew. Q: Did it help that you'd done Ratcatcher? LR: I think Ratcatcher broke even as a film, but it got a good critical response. I think that people knew that it wasn't going to be a conventional piece of work, but they were still willing to invest in it. With this material you have to be quite courageous. GA: None of your films are exactly plot heavy. In Morvern there's chopping up the body and that's about it... LR: I resent that remark. Actually there's quite a big plot. Her boyfriend commits suicide, leaves her a book, she sends it to publishers and takes the money. I'd say that was a plot. GA: But he's killed himself before... LR: I know, but there's different kinds of plots and narratives. GA: Quite often people want to know the story, the pitch. LR: Quite often you get a lot of films with lots of story but no characterisation. I don't like watching things like that, I think, \"What the fuck... \", sorry, \"What the hell's going on?\" You get a lot of information, but you don't care about the characters. This is more a psychological journey. I think it's got a plot, it's just more like a trip. Oh God, I sound really wanky now. GA: But do you get people saying, \"Where's the story?\" LR: You do, but it's a different type of storytelling, and some people go with it and some don't. What I like about the film is that it allows the audience to breathe. I don't make films for everybody; if I did that it would be blandness beyond belief. GA: Did you worry about Samantha Morton not being Scottish? LR: Well, if you talk it abroad, they don't really care one way or another. For me she could have done a Scottish accent, but I liked her accent and the fact that she had a similar background to the character was good - she's a foster kid who grew up in Scotland as well, yet she's got this strong Nottingham accent. I didn't want to inflict the character with an accent that wasn't hers. And English people live in Scotland as well... Q: Did you get involved in the marketing? I saw a poster at an Odeon cinema that said something about Carl Dryer... LR: I do like to be involved with what the poster is, because I think they can often be quite misleading. I would like the posters to have images that are bold and represent the film. It takes two or three years to make a film, so how it's going to be marketed is quite important. But you do have to take it on board that you're not a marketing person, so there has to be some sort of compromise. But you still want something you're happy with that's bold and exciting and represents the film properly. Q: I like the film, because you don't show the big, grand actions like the suicide or obvious drug taking. Is that very conscious? LR: Yeah, I think it would have been ridiculous to have her dragging the body around. I saw her as a \"what if\" character. My identification with her was more, \"Wow, that's pretty out there. Changing the name on the novel is pretty punk rock.\" She's an antihero in a way, she does the things you'd like to do but never would in a way. I saw her as quite iconic. I wanted to use a real economy and leave it up to the imagination about the body. It's quite a leap of faith to get there. I think if I'd shown it really graphically then I think people would have been more cut off. Might have been quite funny though. GA: I think it's the one part of the story that tests credibility... LR: Go on, be nasty! \"What do the bugs mean?\" I knew that it would be risky, but I saw it as a bit of a black fairytale anyway; I didn't see her as a completely realistic character. But Sam Morton adds a reality to her, so it's quite complex. I had to be careful. Q: What did you use to shoot in Spain? LR: We changed the film stock for when Morvern decides to leave the hotel. That was really difficult because we had to shoot everything about seven times in reversal [film]. The guy that played the gypsy got paid the most out of anyone because we had to shoot it seven times. I think he put a curse on the film stock! No one really processes the film anymore, so it went to the lab several times and when it came back there was something wrong with it. It used to be used a lot and it's really beautiful. It's just very expensive and quite difficult to use. Q: What was the white horse in the scene on the road? LR: Oh! That was a donkey. Really well-spotted. It was actually something we cut out of the scene because we didn't get it right, so you just get half a donkey at the end. Q: I really liked the shot in the airport where they look like shadows. How did you choose that? LR: It was just economy. I wanted them to arrive as a mirage, without the usual thing of getting off the plane. Q: I couldn't stitch together the sense of place on the west coast of Scotland... LR: In the film, it doesn't say where it's set, so the location is very generic for me. I think it's a mistake to refer it to the book. Where in the film does it say it's in Oban? Q: Is the bit where she lifts her dress for the boatman in the book? LR: Yes, it was in the book. It was quite a surrealist, intriguing image. There was something really potent about it and I wanted to keep it. The connection of sexuality and grief worked, I think. Q: Was this the first time you worked with a co-writer and what was it like? LR: I'd never worked with a co-writer before. I was asked to write the script while I was in postproduction for Ratcatcher, so I couldn't do it. I thought that because it was an adaptation anyway and a different process, maybe this time I can try a co-writer. Writing Ratcatcher was a really arduous process for me, so the co-writing thing allows you to play with ideas. Liana Dognini started it, just putting the book into script form, which was quite odd. Her work is really similar, her writing is quite like mine, but she's a bit more analytical than me. She's also a director, so she realises that the work will change and she's not too precious about it. I'm working with her on the next film as well. Q: Will you carry on working with professionals and non-actors? LR: I'd like to. The main character in the next film is a 14-year-old girl and it's set in America, so I'd like to find someone that's completely unknown. It's a real ensemble cast, so I might use some British actors too. Q: I found a lot of the film quite difficult to watch. Ratcatcher also dealt with a slightly dysfunctional situation, but its cast of children made it easier to watch. Did you think about the consequences of filming something without children in that way? LR: I just don't see myself as someone who makes films about children all the time. It's a different character; it's a different film. You enter a world that's quite traumatic at first, so maybe that's why you found it hard to watch. Other people thought less so. It's just a personal thing. Q: What's your rehearsal process like and how much is improvised? LR: I can't put a percentage on it. I just use bits that work. In the casting process you can sort of workshop the script. When I was casting Lanna it was the final scene where she says, \"It's the same crap everywhere\" that I was using, and Kathleen did that really well. We spent a lot of time beforehand just getting to know each other. I'd shoot the first rehearsal and then go from there. Kathleen became used to working in that way because every time she met me, I had a camera with me. Q: Was the cockroach rehearsed? LR: That was a nightmare! It took about two days. I realised then that it takes a minute to write a line, but ages to shoot it. Q: Are you still involved in photography? LR: I just take them more as a hobby now, and it's nice not to think about film-making all the time. Q: Is this your dream job? LR: It's a fantastic job, but it's really stressful. You've got to have a life as well, so it's getting the right balance. It's good to be around people that do different stuff and to get a reality check every now and again. But it's fantastic. I can't complain! GA: Thank you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
