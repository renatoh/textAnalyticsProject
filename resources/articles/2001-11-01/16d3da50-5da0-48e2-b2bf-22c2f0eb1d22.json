Ian had an opening 64 to lead the Volvo Masters Andalucia here near Jerez, which gave him a chance to win the first prize of \u00a3333,330. Meanwhile, in the north-east corner of Spain, at Pals near Barcelona, Danny was labouring away at the pre-qualifying school, desperate to win a card that would give him access to the full European Tour and allow him a chance at the riches already being accumulated by baby bro. After two rounds Danny was one over par and down among the dead men, jointly 61st in a field of 76. He was in dire danger of missing the cut and, with only 31 players going forward to next week's final qualifying tournament, Danny needed something good - and both brothers knew it. No sooner was Ian off the course and done with explaining his 64 here than he was on the phone to Pals. \"I just hope,\" he said as he punched the buttons, \"that he's had a 64 like me.\" The news, as it turned out, was good if not quite that good. Danny had returned a five-under-par 68, which had hurtled him up the field to 38th, comfortably avoiding the cut and giving himself a chance of qualifying for the qualifying. The golfing story of the brothers Poulter began when Ian was seven and Danny nine. Their father bought a set of Sam Snead clubs, divided them between the two boys, and they were off. It was Ian who showed the more immediate talent, though, and last season was the European Tour's rookie of the year, winning more than \u00a3266,000 and finishing 30th in the order of merit. This year he won the Moroccan Open, came exceedingly close to making the Ryder Cup team and before this event had earned almost \u00a3450,000. Little wonder that Danny is dying to join in. He will need to raise his game permanently, though. Standards are high on the full Tour and yesterday, on a course measuring 7,069 yards, 51 of the 66 players were par or better. Ian's eight-under score gave him a one-stroke lead over the Australian Peter Lonard; the Dubliner Paul McGinley had a six-under 66, finishing eagle, par, birdie, while Adam Scott and Padraig Harrington were a further stroke away with 67s. Lonard feels he is good enough to win in Europe and says that it is \"killing\" him that he has so far failed. But with more than \u00a3200,000 in his bank account this season he can afford to laugh at the advice he was once offered by his countryman Lyndsey Stephens. \"I'd just won my card,\" Lonard recalled with a smile, \"and Lyndsey came up to me and said: 'Nah, don't go. Too hard. Don't bother going.' How's that for pumping your ego up?\" Two troubled players this season, Lee Westwood and Jose Maria Olazabal, made encouraging starts at three under. Westwood has been working with a new driver, Olazabal with a new coach on his driving, and for both there was some satisfaction. Westwood had four birdies and an eagle, while the Spaniard, who has taken up with Westwood's former coach Pete Cowen, had what earlier in the season he would have regarded as a real day out. \"I missed only two fairways,\" said Olazabal, \"but I was not very good with the putting. I need to make everything work at the same time.\" In golf, it was ever thus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
