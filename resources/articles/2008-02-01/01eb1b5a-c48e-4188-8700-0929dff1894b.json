You swab your cheek, send it to a lab and - poof! - you learn your identity. It sounds ridiculous to put it that way - and that's why I haven't taken the test yet. For sure, I'd love answers to some questions that have nagged me my whole life, like: why do I get so tan? It makes no sense, since that's a trait I get from my mother's side of the family, and they're as Waspy as it gets. Will the lab results confirm the family legend that Seneca blood may have found its way into the Holcombe lineage at some point during the last couple of centuries? Maybe. And then what? I suppose I can apply to get some casino money. But of course I won't. That would be ridiculous, because I'm not going to suddenly start identifying as an American Indian. And yet, isn't that sort of the implication - that genetic information might somehow trump the identity we acquired from the culture we grew up in? Public television has started airing another beautifully produced series from African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr that proceeds from that fundamental assumption. It's a genealogical Antiques Roadshow: Gates sits with Americans of African decent and confronts them with surprises about their own ancestors. In one episode, the comedian Chris Rock discovers things about his family that make him cry. Wise guy Chris Rock, who grew up in the tough Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bed-Stuy, crying! All because he learned for the first time that his great-great-grandfather had not only fought in the Union army but also went on to serve in the South Carolina legislature. Rock said that if he had known this information as a kid, there's a good chance he wouldn't have become a comedian. He went on: \"Until I lucked into a comedy club at age 20, just on a whim, I assumed I would pick up things for white people for the rest of my life. If I'd have known this, it would have taken away the inevitability I was gonna be nothing.\" Forget the fact that, just minutes before, he contradicted himself by saying he grew up wanting to be the president of the United States. The real problem is that he learned the wrong lesson. Rock's argument is that it was important to know he had a noteworthy ancestor, to give him a greater sense of promise for himself as a young person. To become somebody. But his thinking is backwards. The fact is, he did become somebody in defiance of a world that told him he was a nobody. The story of Rock's greatness is that, even without knowledge of his eminent ancestor, he still became a comic genius superstar. One day, DNA will allow us to construct the human family tree in such detail that we will find the most recent ancestor I share with Rock. And if it explains my surprisingly dark skin, then great. But if it makes me change my sense of identity, then please grab me by both shoulders and shake me free from this dangerous fantasy. Henry Louis Gates says this: \"Knowledge of who we are as a people forms the foundation that each of us can build upon to succeed even against almost impossible odds.\" I admire Gates, a lot, but he got this one wrong. We are who we are in spite of where we came from, and Chris Rock's story proves it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
