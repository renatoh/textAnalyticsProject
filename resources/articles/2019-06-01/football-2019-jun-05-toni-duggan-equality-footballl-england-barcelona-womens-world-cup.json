Equality for me is having a pitch to play on and hot showers in the changing rooms, before we talk about the money we get.\u201d With the USA women\u2019s national team\u2019s lawsuit, filed in March, against US Soccer alleging \u201cinstitutionalised gender discrimination\u201d ongoing and calls from Professional Footballers Australia to close the $370m (\u00a3292m) gap in the World Cup prize fund, equality is a hot topic. \u201cI have a strong opinion on it,\u201d Duggan says of the battle in the US, \u201cand I believe they should be doing it because they\u2019re more successful than their men\u2019s team.\u201d But her views on the disparity in England are very different. \u201cShould we be doing it? No. Because we don\u2019t bring in the money that the men do \u2013 we\u2019re not as successful as them yet. They bring in a lot more money than us commercially and are more successful. When people ask me: \u2018Should I earn the same money as the men?\u2019 No, I don\u2019t believe I should because they\u2019re on a bigger scale than me, they have more fans, are more popular. I believe the girls should be better paid but not the same as the men.\u201d The 27-year-old has just finished her second season with Barcelona which culminated in a 4-1 defeat by Lyon in the Spanish side\u2019s first Champions League final. The game at the Wanda Metropolitano she refers to, a 2-0 win against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in March, attracted a league\u2011record crowd of 60,739. For Duggan, who scored in that victory, it was the quality of the attendance, not the quantity, that was key. \u201cThere\u2019s a picture of me celebrating and behind me there\u2019s actually a man putting one finger up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m not promoting that or saying it\u2019s a good thing but it kind of showed what it meant. You could feel the passion in the stadium that day. It was a real atmosphere, it was a massive game and it was only a league game. \u201cIn England, I think we get about 30,000 for maybe an FA Cup final and there are lots of kids on the seats, which is nice don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s a calm atmosphere.\u201d In contrast the game at the Metropolitano felt like a \u201cproper game\u201d. \u201cThe fans really wanted to be there for their team \u2013 the Atl\u00e9tico supporters were giving us stick, they were booing us, there were flares. I\u2019m not encouraging all of it \u2013 there are some things in the men\u2019s game we don\u2019t want \u2013 but I\u2019m just saying it felt like a proper atmosphere. \u201cSometimes we can give away free tickets and get 20,000 but 10,000 are free. But at the Wanda those people had bought those tickets, they were diehard Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans and were there to see their team win and that\u2019s the difference between England and Spain for me. Sometimes [in Spain] you can go to stadiums and there are 2,000 people there but it feels like it\u2019s 10,000.\u201d Duggan adds by way of explanation: \u201cIn Spain there\u2019s a lot more publicity \u2026 when we\u2019re successful we\u2019re front page of the newspaper \u2013 every newspaper and the big ones, Marca and others \u2013 but then also when we lose we\u2019re slated. That\u2019s the level the game is at. It\u2019s the same as the men\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re treated there.\u201d She says she is not calling for constant criticism from the media but that there is an appeal to being held to the same standards as the men. \u201cIn the past we might have lost a game and you get fans messaging you saying: \u2018Ah, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve done so well,\u2019 and it can be a bit patronising, do you know what I mean? We\u2019ve actually played badly and people are saying: \u2018Ah, we\u2019re so proud.\u2019 Is it just because we\u2019re the women\u2019s team? Is it just because we\u2019re girls? If that was the men you wouldn\u2019t be saying that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
