One hundred and 20 years later, Irish and English homosexuals can flourish in a society that would be unrecognisable to the author of The Importance of Being Earnest. Fifty years on from the passing of the Sexual Offences Act, which decriminalised homosexual acts between adults, we celebrate this anniversary as a landmark in the progressive humanisation of British society. Ever since Shakespeare wrote in Sonnet 20 of \u201cthe master-mistress of my passion\u201d, our culture has grappled with unresolved, and sometimes troubling, issues of gender and sexuality. There is a side of English life that\u2019s raucous, philistine and homophobic. But there\u2019s respect and affection, too. Before his disgrace, Wilde was spoofed by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan in Patience. It is also intrinsic to the national tradition that \u201cthe poorest he\u201d should have a fair hearing. For the gay community, these twin strands of humanity and egalitarian instinct have become braided with the legal and cultural expression of our right to sexual self-determination. When David Cameron declared at the 2006 Conservative party conference that marriage \u201cmeans something whether you are a man and a woman, a woman and a woman or a man and another man\u201d, he was adopting the language of the Wolfenden report, the sensibilities of novels by Hanif Kureishi or Alan Hollinghurst, plus decades of gay rights activism. While we recognise the continuing discrimination, sometimes violence, that can disfigure our culture, here at the Observer, we prefer to find the sky not falling. Gay men are no longer on prison treadmills or picking oakum in solitary confinement. More than 100 years of painfully slow social reform have given hope and dignity to the gay community and we salute that achievement. It\u2019s another reason to be proud of civilised life in the British Isles. \u2022 Comments will be opened later"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
