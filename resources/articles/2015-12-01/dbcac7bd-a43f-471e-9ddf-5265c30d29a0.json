April Clarke said she was \u201cdumbstruck and fearing for my life\u201d when confronted by a Special Emergency Response Team (Sert) officer pointing an assault rifle at her from less than two metres away. The raid took place in March when Clarke, then 13, was sleeping over at the northside Brisbane home of her mother Gerry Lister and stepfather Greg Blackwell, a Rebels bikie. Police executed a warrant naming three alleged clubmates of Blackwell who were wanted on charges of gathering in public \u2013 namely at a Redcliffe hotel \u2013 an offence in Queensland which can see bikies jailed for up to two years. However, none of the trio was living at the house when Sert crashed through the door and held her and Blackwell on the floor at gunpoint, Lister said. One of the alleged bikies had previously stayed at the house for two months after a marriage break-up, while another had stayed \u201cthree or four nights\u201d on separate occasions, she said. Clarke, who was woken by noise downstairs, said she was sitting up in bed when her door \u201cslammed open and a bright light was shone into my eyes followed by a mysterious black hole at the end\u201d. \u201cThe mysterious object was a large gun. The gun was a really long object. I could tell by the way his arm was out, the gun pointing directly at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was police or what. It was just really scary, heaps of really loud yelling. I tried to hide myself. They said show me your face, put your hands behind your head.\u201d Clarke said the Sert officers \u201cwatched me like I was going to pull out a weapon\u201d as they let her put a top over her bra then ushered her downstairs. By then in tears, she saw \u201cmy stepdad struggling on the ground and heaps of men pointing guns at him\u201d while her mother was also held to the floor at gunpoint with an officer\u2019s boot on her neck. \u201cThat was unrealistic, I\u2019d never seen that besides in scary, intense movies. That was horrific for me,\u201d she said. Clarke said she began sobbing when Blackwell called out to her: \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong, Boo.\u201d \u201cThat made me cry, to see him care, a \u2018big bad bikie\u2019 showing emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a bad person. It\u2019s just scary now we know that it doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re innocent or not, we don\u2019t get a say in what [police] will do.\u201d Sert officers are enlisted to deal with the arrests of \u201carmed and dangerous offenders\u201d. Blackwell, who has no criminal history, previously kept guns under licence at his home, which the warrant noted had a \u201clarge confederate flag\u201d (an emblem used by the Rebels) flying at the front. But Lister said Blackwell had told gang squad police months before the raid that he had moved the weapons to his workplace, then sold them when he understood his licence would not be renewed because of his membership of the Rebels. No charges resulted from the raid. The warrant stated police were looking for clothing, jewellery and phones belonging to the three alleged bikies, as well as documents showing their membership of the club. One of the bikies was arrested in a simultaneous raid on his then residence. He and another of the trio were charged with recruiting for the gang, also a criminal offence in Queensland. Later that morning Lister, who runs an employment agency for troubled youth, was able to attend an address by Jordan Belfort, the \u201cwolf of Wall Street\u201d, at a friend\u2019s training organisation. Police have offered $3,245 compensation for damage to the house \u2013 an offer that Lister and Blackwell have rejected while considering legal action. The United Motorcycle Council of Queensland, in a submission to the Wilson taskforce charged with making recommendations on repealing and replacing the anti-bikie legislation, cites Clarke\u2019s experience as an example of the \u201csignificant increase in violence and intimidation\u201d by police towards bikies and their families under the state\u2019s crackdown. The UMCQ said it was \u201cseriously concerned about the way in which members of the QPS [Queensland police service] have gone about enforcing and subsequently prosecuting\u201d the anti-bikie provisions. It claimed \u201cabuses\u201d included police threatening bikies with the arrest of family members. Queensland police in their submission to the Wilson taskforce referred to the risks officers faced dealing with bikies. One national club president arrested on the Gold Coast allegedly threatened to \u201chunt down the arresting police officer [and] rape his family before killing the police officer\u201d. A senior police officer familiar with the raid involving Clarke has told Guardian Australia he could not comment on her version of events. But he said Sert officers operated with their rifles clearly visible. This could give rise to the perception that a gun was trained on somebody, regardless of whether it was or not, he said. Clarke said the raid had been a traumatic experience that was \u201cnot going to fade away any time soon\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s still frightening. It could be hearing a loud noise or a possum on the roof at home and it\u2019s the first thing that comes into my head. I can\u2019t have any lights on in the dark any more because it reminds me of the torch right in my face. I can\u2019t sleep with any noises any more because it\u2019s just an uneasy feeling,\u201d she said. Lister said she and Blackwell continue to have positive contact with local police through her agency\u2019s involvement in Project Booyah, a police-run youth program. But Clarke said she continued to have \u201cmajor trust issues with police\u201d. \u201cThings have chilled out a little now the police and Mum are talking, that helps a lot. But I still won\u2019t forgive them for what they did.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
