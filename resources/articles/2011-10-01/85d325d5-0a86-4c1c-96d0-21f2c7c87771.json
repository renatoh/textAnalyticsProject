If you missed it, Bafana Bafana went into their final group game against Sierra Leone level on eight points with their opponents and one point behind Niger, who were taking on Egypt. Just over an hour into the game in Nelspruit it was 0-0, but Niger were 3-0 down in Cairo. So as it stood, three teams were level on nine points. South Africa had comfortably the best goal difference, but, unfortunately for them, the head-to-head record was the one that mattered and on that criterion Niger led by a point (Niger had picked up six points against South Africa and Sierra Leone, South Africa only five against Sierra Leone and Niger). South Africa, then, needed a goal. Unfortunately their coach, Pitso Mosimane, wasn't up to speed on the regulations and decided to play for the draw. Which they got. Cue celebrations on the pitch, and then recriminations. Mosimane admitted he had been at fault. \"Do you think I would have left [striker Lehlohonolo] Majoro on the bench and put on a midfielder if I knew that we needed a goal? It doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"I feel like I have failed,\" he added, somehow substituting the words \"feel like I have\" for \"have definitely and unforgivably\". \"The European and South American formats are so much better,\" he whined, seemingly unaware that qualification for Euro 2012 works on exactly the same basis. The South African Football Association has even had the gall to write to the Confederation of African Football challenging the rules. \"We are not satisfied about the decision, our CEO has written to CAF and we want to engage further,\" said the Safa vice-president, Mandla \"Shoes\" Mazibuko. \"As far as we are concerned, a goal-difference rule should be the first criteria.\" So an embarrassing episode for all concerned, and one only compounded by their refusal to accept it. Still, they're not alone. Back in 1995-96 the battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League had gone right down to the wire. Coming into the final day, Manchester City, Southampton and Coventry City were all level on 33 points. Alan Ball's Manchester City, whose goal difference was seven goals worse than their rivals, occupied 18th spot, the final relegation place (the fates of QPR and Bolton having already been sealed). They welcomed third-placed Liverpool to Maine Road on the final day, Coventry hosted mid-table Leeds and Southampton took on Wimbledon, themselves not mathematically certain of survival, at the Dell. Things didn't start well in Manchester \u2013 a Steve Lomas own goal after six minutes gave Liverpool the lead and four minutes before half-time Ian Rush made it 2-0 to the visitors. At the break the games at Highfield Road and the Dell were both goalless. Hope for City came in the shape of an Uwe R\u00f6sler penalty after 71 minutes and seven minutes later Kit Symons equalised. Maine Road went bananas, but the home side still needed to score again if Coventry and Southampton held on for draws. Ball and his players were perfectly aware of this, but what they hadn't counted on was duff information. Somehow Ball got the impression that Southampton had gone behind. \"He called me over and said: 'We're up, kill this game off, just do whatever you can,\" recalled Lomas years later. It was the unfortunate Northern Irishman who took the ball to the corner flag and began playing for time. It was the substituted Niall Quinn who alerted Lomas to the mistake. \"I had gone off 15 minutes from time and was watching it on TV,\" said Quinn. \"So I had to run up the tunnel and get the message on that we needed another.\" It was all in vain. It ended 2-2 and City were relegated on goal difference. Somehow Ball survived the debacle, but after three games of the following season he was out. But there's more. Jonathan Wilson points us towards to what he describes as \"the famous case of Olt Scornicesti\" but what everyone else would call \"the little-known case of Olt Scornicesti\". Scornicesti was the home village of Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's brutal and despotic communist leader between 1965 and 1989. Jonathan picks up the story in his excellent Behind The Curtain (available in all good bookshops, etc and so forth): \"Under Florin Halagian \u2013 a coach who has been accused of beating his charges, and would commonly kick under-performing players off the team bus on the way back from away games \u2013 the side from Ceausescu's home village miraculously earned three successive promotions in the late 70s. On one occasion they put 17 past Electrodul Slatina in the second half to win 18-0, having erroneously been informed that their rivals Flacara Moreni, who were 2-0 up at half-time, were winning 9-0.\" The problem was one of communication. With no phone line connecting the two villages, men were stationed between the two grounds with radios and instructed to relay the score to Scornicesti. Unfortunately, but rather predictably, this game of Chinese whispers went awry. On hearing the wrong score, the referee, having already blown for full-time, apparently dragged the sides out of the changing rooms and played enough injury time for the home side to rack up the goals they needed, thus securing Scornicesti's promotion. Other examples of fans, rather than the players or manager, getting it wrong are listed in this old Knowledge, but here's an addendum: on the final day of the season at Gigg Lane in May 2009, a late goal sparked a pitch invasion, with several hundred fans seeming to believe the strike had secured promotion. It hadn't. The Shakers were still in the play-offs and the delay did no one any favours. TEAMS WEARING THEIR OPPONENTS' KIT (2) Last week we looked at the sides forced, through incompetence or misfortune, to wear their opponents threads. And, as ever, the Knowledge inbox has been bulging with fresh examples. We begin with a tale from the horse's mouth, as it were. \"As a non-league journeyman in the 80s I was a fringe player at Altrincham when, I think, Maidstone came to Moss Lane having forgotten their kit,\" writes Mark Davies. \"Their request to borrow the Alty away kit was granted but the kit bag wasn't delivered to the away dressing room until about 10 minutes before kick-off, thus depriving Maidstone of a warm-up. Manager John King would go to any length to give his team an advantage.\" As Kieran Holden points out, Crewe Alexandra were, due to a colour clash, forced to wear Stevenage's away kit at the Lamex Stadium on the opening day of last season. \"I don't think you should have to play against your own badge,\" said an angry Stevenage manager, Graham Westley, after a 1-1 draw. \"How a professional club can't organise its kit in the week before a game I don't know.\" Portsmouth were beset by very different problems on their 2010 tour of the United States. A nightmare couple of weeks concluded with a game against DC United in Washington, but having endured a weather-affected flight from Edmonton, they arrived in the US capital without their luggage. After a dash to the stadium (they arrived just a couple of hours before kick-off) they had to borrow United's away kit. And then play in 38C heat. They lost 4-0. Others who have suffered the ignominy of the kit swap include Grimsby at Crystal Palace in 1975, Birmingham at Crystal Palace in 1997 and later the same year at Oldham, Falkirk at Raith Rovers in 1988-89, and Notts County at Huddersfield in 1989-90. \"This was the infamous yellow and black chequerboard that Town had worn when losing 10-1 to Man City,\" writes David Stephenson of that final incident. \"Notts County beat Town 2-1, the only time a side won wearing that strip.\" TWO LEGS GOOD, INELIGIBLE PLAYER BAD \"This week in the AFC Asian Champions League, Iranian side Sepahan were eliminated from the tournament despite winning both legs of their quarter-final,\" wrote Topolab last week. \"Sepahan won their first match against Al-Sadd 1-0, but the AFC ruled that because they fielded an ineligible player they actually lost 3-0. Sepahan then won the away leg 2-1, and lost 4-2 on aggregate. Has any other team been eliminated from a tournament after winning both legs of a two-legged tie?\" \"You don't have to go far back for that,\" writes Jostein Nygard. \"In the second round of the AFC World Cup qualification back in July, Syria beat Tajikistan 2-1 at home, followed by a 5-0 away win five days later. This didn't help Syria as Fifa found that they had used an ineligible player in both matches, and awarded Tajikistan two 3-0 wins.\" An even more spectacular turnaround than that 7-1 reversal came in the Uefa Cup in 2007-08. FK Partizan played NK Zrinjski of Bosnia in the first qualifying round,\" writes Dusan Manojlovic. \"Partizan won 11-1 on aggregate but were eliminated from the competition after crowd trouble in Mostar in the first leg. The decision to throw them out for certain only came after the second leg.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Here's a little something from those sepia-tinged days when London was nothing but fields and a Mars bar cost 25p \u2013 2007. Following on from our recent international football power couples article, several of you reminded us of a recent tale from the German tabloids \u2026 According to Bild, the former German international and M\u00f6nchengladbach coach Holger Fach found himself in the middle of a bisexual love triangle with two members of the women's national team. Fach began dating Inga Grings soon after she had broken up with her Duisburg and Germany team-mate Linda Bresonik. \"He has made Inga like men,\" reported Bild, before Fach added: \"She is a great girl. Apart from that I'm saying nothing.\" Within a matter of weeks, however, Bild was back on the case, claiming Grings and Bresonik had got back together. \"This is the greatest love story in German football,\" deadpanned the paper, before Bresonik declared: \"Inka was my first love and I will fight for her. The pain in my soul overwhelms. Fach came between us: now Inka must decide.\" A final twist in the tale appears to have taken place since. \"It gets better,\" writes one reader, ein-Toaster. \"Grings and Fach split up and Fach ended up with, you've guessed it, Bresonik.\" For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive CAN YOU HELP? \"I was thinking about the Baltimore Ravens, for no particular reason,\" begins William Forbes, \"and the fact that they get their name from the Edgar Allan Poe poem. Have any football clubs gotten their name or nickname from a piece of literature?\" \"Sheffield Wednesday have had 12 different goalscorers in their 12 league games so far this season,\" notes Chris Hogg. \"Is this the furthest into a season that the number of goalscorers has equalled (or bettered) the number of games played?\" \"Noticing Stephen Shepherd's story last week about half of Gillingham's side not making the Orient game due to traffic, are there any other infamous cases of a side not arriving on time for the game?\" asks Kevin Meadowcroft. \"Have any footballers displayed interest in, or demonstrated their credentials in, the environmental movement?\" wonders James Harris.
