At a launch for the party\u2019s election manifesto in Shoreditch, east London, its leader insisted they were \u201cthe biggest and best organised of the remain parties\u201d in their preparations for the 23 May vote. While climate change and cutting crime rates were high on the agenda, the event laid down the Lib Dems\u2019 main aim to \u201cstop Brexit\u201d and hold a second referendum. Earlier on Thursday Cable unveiled the slogan for the party\u2019s campaign to remain in the EU \u2013 \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d \u2013 a phrase so frank, he claimed, that a supporter had fainted upon hearing it. In last week\u2019s local elections the Lib Dems made big gains, leaving them in control of 18 councils and with 676 councillors. Appearing on his 76th birthday, Cable, said: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic, buoyed up by last week. Everybody underestimated us, and I think they\u2019re underestimating us again.\u201d He has confirmed that he plans to step aside after fighting the European election campaign in time for a new leader to be in place by the summer. While he championed EU freedom of movement as \u201ca precious thing\u201d, the MP for Twickenham also said being a part of the union meant the country was better at tackling threats like data cooperation and protecting itself from being bullied by the US president, Donald Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t deal with the Trump problem by grovelling and inviting him here for state business,\u201d he added. Also speaking at the launch, the former secretary of state for climate change and Lib Dem MP for Kingston and Surbiton Sir Ed Davey said: \u201cSometimes people say they don\u2019t know what we stand for \u2013 I think they get the message now.\u201d Emphasising the importance of European arrest warrants, the EU\u2019s law enforcement body Europol and other intelligence-sharing services in fighting \u201corganised crime gangs, terrorists, murderers and rapists\u201d, he said that \u201cwe also need to stop Brexit to stop the criminals.\u201d \u201cThe world\u2019s most dangerous criminals want Brexit to go ahead,\u201d he added. \u201cThe criminals know that the security deal that has not yet even been agreed is weak, pathetic and will make every British citizen less safe than now. Brexit is a thousand crimes or more waiting to happen.\u201d Investment in the NHS, building affordable homes to help young people on to the housing ladder and more funding for schools were also listed as key issues for the party. Jo Swinson, Lib Dem MP for East Dunbartonshire, invoked the \u201ctide of populism, with nationalism rolling in, Trump in the east and Putin in the west\u201d. She added: \u201cSurely this is not the time to turn our backs on our closest allies, our closest neighbours who share our liberal values.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
