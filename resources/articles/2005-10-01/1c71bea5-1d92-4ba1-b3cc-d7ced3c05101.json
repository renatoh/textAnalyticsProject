This was potentially a very highly-charged match. Quite apart from the positions of the two teams, their last meeting - at Wycombe in March - was nothing if not ill-tempered. Wycombe won 4-2 that day, with Nathan Tyson scoring twice. Although Tyson has been one of the hottest strikers in the country this season, some Chester players clearly have mixed feelings about him. Last week, Chester winger Ben Davies said: 'He's a very quick lad. He's a decent player but he likes to tell everyone he is a decent player as well.' Chester prevented him scoring yesterday, but they did not have much luck with others. Still, it was not difficult to appreciate Chester manager Keith Curle's point about the improvement in his team's 'mental strength' since his arrival. They allowed Wycombe to fight back from 2-0 down to lead 3-2, but still had enough determination and power to make it 3-3. The leaders, Grimsby, also had to settle for a draw, at Shrewsbury. But one leading team who collected maximum points were Leyton Orient, who beat bottom club Mansfield 3-1 to move into second place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
