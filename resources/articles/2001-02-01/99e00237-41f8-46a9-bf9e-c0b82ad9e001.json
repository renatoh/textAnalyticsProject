Speaking in north London at one of Britain's first state schools to have been built with private sector money, the prime minister outlined radical new ideas on education, crime, and his beloved \"knowledge-based economy\". Downing Street, which billed the speech as Mr Blair's \"route map\" for a historic full second term in office, said that the prime minister wanted to flesh out one broad theme - how to marry what were once seen as the mutually exclusive aims of achieving social justice while promoting an enterprise economy. The prime minister told his audience at Highlands School, in the marginal Labour seat of Enfield Southgate, that his reforms were designed to break down barriers which still hold back people across society, \"an indispensable part of building a decent and prosperous country. It cannot be achieved by the government standing back and allowing a Darwinian survival of the fittest and pretending that it is meritocracy. It requires an active government ensuring a fair playing field and investing in our people and in our public services to release the potential of all.\" Education Mr Blair devoted a large part of his speech to education because Downing Street believes that years of neglect have denied millions of talented children a chance to flourish. The prime minister said he wanted to nearly double the number of schoolchildren who go to university by targeting the less well off. As a first step, Labour will ensure that more than 50% of people under the age of 30 go to university by 2010. At the moment 30% go to university. Mr Blair said: \"At present, whereas nearly threequarters of the children of professional parents go to university, barely one in six of children of parents in manual occupations do so.\" The government will increase the number of graduates from deprived backgrounds through a range of measures. These include: \u0095 Ensuring that by next year, 50% of students' parents pay no tuition fees; \u0095 Offering bursaries of \u00a32,000 to 25,000 students from poorer backgrounds and an extra 5% funding for students from less privileged backgrounds; \u0095 Ensuring that the top universities recruit more students from state schools. Mr Blair announced that the government has agreed to give an extra \u00a318m to 27 univerisites, including Oxford and Cambridge, where state school students account for less than 80% of undergraduates. By spelling out new ideas to open up universities to the less well off, Mr Blair hopes that the better off will understand that tuition fees are a price worth paying to expand higher education. He also made clear that improvements to secondary schools would be a major priority, saying that the education secretary, David Blunkett, would unveil a 10-year education plan on Monday which would lead to \"an ovrehaul of the comprehensive system\". The prime minister announced that the number of specialist secondary schools would be doubled in the next five years to 1,500. At the moment, specialist schools cover languages, mathematics, art and sport. But Mr Blair said: \"We will offer schools three new specialisms: engineering, science, business and enterprise. The business and enterprise schools will develop strong business and entrepreneurial links and encourage many more pupils into business and industry.\" Downing Street believes that specialist schools have played a major role in improving education standards. The son of the prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, attends a specialist language school in north London. Crime Mindful of the crucial role crime played at the last election, when Labour overtook the Tories on the issue for the first time, the prime minister said the government would step up its reforms of the criminal justice system later this month. Mr Blair said that the home secretary, Jack Straw, would publish a crime plan which will \"set out root-and-branch reform of every aspect of the criminal justice system\". Mr Blair boasted that crime has fallen by 10%, with domestic burglary down by 21%. But he admitted that violent crime was still increasing, an uncomfortable fact, and confessed: \"I do not believe we can carry on with a criminal justice system that is often, despite the hard work of those that operate it, unco-ordinated, ineffective, hopelessly out of date, and that fails to distinguish how we tackle criminality, including random and highly organised crime that threatens our social order.\" Baby bonds Beyond the \"big picture\" areas of education and crime, Mr Blair outlined a series of initiatives which are designed to ensure that Labour's manifesto has a radical edge that it lacked in 1997. One of these is the so called \"baby bond\". Mr Blair said: \"As well as the big policy announcements there will be a range of other programmes [including] help [for] young people to accumulate assets early in life that give them a financial base for the future.\" Under the plan, the government would set up a \u00a31,000 savings account for every newborn child, known as a \"baby bond\". For every pound which parents from poorer families placed in the account, the government would offer a further \u00a32. The prime minister is attracted by the idea of \"baby bonds\" because he believes they embody his \"third way\" philosophy which combines elements from the right and the left of the political spectrum. The bonds appeal to the left because they are a classic form of welfare provision. But they should also appeal to the right because they encourage saving - a key Tory election pledge. Mr Blair said his plans were designed to offer a supporting hand to people who should then accept their responsibilities to society. \"Two themes run through all of this agenda: opportunity and responsibility,\" Mr Blair said. \"[These] are about people, their individual development and potential; giving them the chance to develop their potential; insisting on their duty to make the most of their chance they get.\" Enterprise Labour's education and social reforms, the prime minister said, were not simply inspired by fairness, but by a hard-headed assessment of what needs to be done to ensure Britain can compete in the global economy. \"Today the economic and the social in politics go together,\" Mr Blair said. \"Human capital is the key to economic advancement in a knowledge economy ... Opening up economy and society to merit and talent is the true radical second term agenda.\" Bankrupty The prime minister paid tribute to Peter Mandelson - though he stopped short of naming his former confidante - when he dusted off one of Mr Mandelson's ideas and pledged to reform Britain's bankruptcy laws. Mr Blair said that he would \"change insolvency law to reduce the stigma of bankruptcy and stimulate entrepreneurship\". His pledged mirrored the thinking of Mr Mandelson, who during his brief stint as trade and industry secretary, proposed reforms to the bankruptcy laws in 1998 after a trip to the US, where he was impressed by the number of businessmen who picked themselves up after going bust. On breaking down barriers 'It cannot be achieved by the government standing back and allowing a Darwinian survival of the fittest. It requires an active government ensuring a level playing field' On schools 'We will offer three new specialisms: engineering, science, business and enterprise. They will encourage many more pupils into business and industry' On justice 'I do not believe we can carry on with a criminal justice system that is often unco-ordinated, ineffective and hopelessly out of date'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
