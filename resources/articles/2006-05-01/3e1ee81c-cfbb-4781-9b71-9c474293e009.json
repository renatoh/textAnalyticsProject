Leon Knight dropped a division by swapping the Seagulls for the Swans after one too many disagreements with Mark McGhee and the \u00a3125,000 Kenny Jackett spent to bring him to south Wales in January has proved a wise investment. Knight's latest repayment was to propel them into the League One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium - against the winner of tonight's second semi-final between Huddersfield and Barnsley - with a blistering brace. The 23-year-old was touted as a future England international during his days at Chelsea's academy. The striker failed to live up to the hype but he has never been short on goals and a hat-trick in the opening 27 minutes of his Swansea debut immediately won over the doubters. Knight, a master at courting controversy, also admitted he was \"absolutely delighted\" to see his previous employers relegated from the Championship last month and will revel in waving at his former manager should he pass them on the way up. \"Mark McGhee didn't seem to think I could have kept them up but it looks like it is backfiring in this case,\" said Knight. \"Kenny Jackett is the opposite type of manager to Mark McGhee. He has spoken to me and that's all a player can ask.\" Jackett said: \"I've known him since he was a very young man at Chelsea. You could see his quality all the way through. Picking him up for the price we did was a bargain. He's moved down to Wales and has bought a house there. He wants to give it a go for me and the club.\" Knight's first finish on eight minutes was an act of pure audacity. Willy Gueret's long punt went all the way through to the diminutive striker, who barely had time to contemplate his actions before leaping to loop a cushioned volley over Stuart Nelson with the outside of his right foot. The Brentford goalkeeper was left stranded on the penalty spot, the victim of Knight's devastating finishing instinct. The second goal, seven minutes later, again illustrated his fearlessness. Andy Frampton had the misfortune to kick the ball against his standing foot in his own half and Leon Britton instinctively took advantage by threading the ball into Knight's path. The touch to nudge the ball in front of him was sublime but the thumping shot past Nelson was of even higher quality. Two moments of genius and Swansea were two ahead. \"They were excellent - fantastic finishes, both of them. They were two goals out of nothing,\" added Jackett. Knight's brace prompted Martin Allen, the Brentford manager, to send on a third forward but the switch simply increased the pressure on his side to contain Swansea's counter-attacking instincts. Brentford's efforts were never in doubt but they desperately required a striker of Knight's quality. Allen, with his side's creative spark crucially absent, must have flashed an envious glance at the opposition bench, on which sat Swansea's top goalscorer Lee Trundle. \"I'm bitterly disappointed,\" said Allen, his voice cracking with emotion. \"I've got no complaints. They were the stronger team on the day. I thought we were going to win - I expected to win.\" Man of the match Leon Knight (Swansea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
