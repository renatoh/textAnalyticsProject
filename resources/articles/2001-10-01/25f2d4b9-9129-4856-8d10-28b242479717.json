Usually, I'm with Alvy on such matters. But miss the start of The Pledge and you're actually better off because Sean Penn begins his third film as a director with a mistake. He opens on Jack Nicholson looking like a tramp, babbling incoherently, jabbing a finger at the harsh sun. It's a brief prologue, but its memory annoys throughout not only because we'll have to return to it but also because it suggests, misleadingly, that this is one of those big, show-offy performances from Nicholson. But in an instant change of colour and tone, Penn starts a slow zoom through a snowy mist to a hut on a frozen lake. Had Penn started with this shot, it would have better established the creeping atmosphere of foreboding that is The Pledge's main attribute. But hey, I'm being anal. The Pledge is a gripping film and, as one would expect from Sean Penn, it's very moody, with dark birds (ravens, crows, buzzards, that sort of portentous thing) beating across icy skies while Native Americans wail over bluesy guitars on the soundtrack. Starting from Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt's novel The Pledge, Penn has attempted an existential detective thriller, a pitch not many directors could get away with in Hollywood. But Penn is nothing if not committed, proving to be as gutsy, wild and restless a director as he is a performer. The intensity of Penn's vision is anchored by a downbeat treat of a performance from Nicholson, who only strays in those unfortunate book-end scenes. Throughout the rest of the film, he's on best behaviour playing Jerry Black, a veteran police detective who walks out of his own retirement party to take one last case, a grisly child murder. He makes a pledge to the dead girl's mother that he will find the killer. 'There can't be such a devil,' she despairs. Jack stares hard for the reply: 'There are such devils, m'am.' Convinced the killer is still loose, he retires to the Nevada mountains, ostensibly to run a gas station and to fish. But his life becomes an obsessive quest for the one that got away, using live bait in the shape of Robin Wright Penn and her daughter to reel him in. The film's central debate is thus one of ends justifying means, like Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter, in which Ian Holm's lawyer questioned his own profession amid similar snowscapes. The Pledge does not deal in easy answers and is all the more effective for it. As an actor, Penn the director knows how best to highlight his leading man's work, focusing on his stubby fingers and dirty nails, good for unscrewing whisky bottles and tugging at cigarettes but clumsy for swiping credit cards or making human contact. Penn lets the camera roam over that craggy, baggy face, with its bristly whiskers and eyebrows hooding dark eyes against the cold light, the sort of eyes Michael Caine's Jack Carter might call 'pissholes in the snow'. As an actor-turned-director Penn also minds the golden rule: get a good Director of Photography. Britain's finest, Chris Menges, is on terrific form here, shooting one of the year's most memorable and moving scenes in the incubator tent of a turkey farm. But Penn's star allure (he also co-produced) can be distracting and indulgent - the special guests whose presence doubtless helped financing (Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Sam Shepard) all overcook their cameos. More successful are the various rednecks: a piggy boy, a wiry old receptionist, a pixie-ish shop woman in a Santa hat. Despite the occasional histrionics, Penn is becoming a good and thoughtful director. His previous films, The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard, boasted good performances but lacked cohesion. The Pledge achieves the stamp of a certain style and is clearly the work of a man probing life's beauty and misery in a determinedly artistic bid to fathom its absurdity. You could now say of Penn what they used to say of Albert Camus: he's on the side of the angels but he gives the devil a damn good run for his money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
