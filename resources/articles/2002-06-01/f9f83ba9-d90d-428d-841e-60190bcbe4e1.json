The Times, the Guardian and the BBC for news, and the Onion for satirical news. I look at them every day. Last online purchase? Probably a flight to Berlin, for business, with BA. I always fly either with them or with United Airlines to the States. I probably buy something online - flights, books, CDs - every two to three weeks. Ever been in a chatroom? No. I've been working in computers for so long that I don't like to spend my leisure time using them. Most recent technological faux pas? Nothing really springs to mind...but I should hope not, considering the job I do! Main news source on the web? I go to different ones for different things. For news updates, it's the BBC site, but if I want in-depth analysis it's the Times or the Economist. I like the BBC site because of its independent reporting - it's slightly less political than the Times or the Guardian. Most useful website? Given how often I travel - once or twice a month - it's probably the United Airlines site. It's very easy to use. I also love looking at the number of air miles I've got. Least useful website? The Home Office. Do you use a screensaver? Yes, well, a blank one, more for energy preservation than anything. I used to enjoy After Dark when it came out a few years ago, with the flying toasters. But then I didn't want that on my laptop. Most irritating thing about the internet? The spam. I get a constant stream of it to all my public email addresses - Nigerian credit card scams, mortgage offers, porn... What type of online business do you think is least likely to succeed? I'm not sure about online newspapers. Everyone expects everything on the net to be free, so I don't think people will pay for online newspapers. I know I won't. Do you still bother with old media? Oh yes. I'll look at newspaper sites online, but if I'm looking to read a newspaper, I'll buy one. I read the Times every day, occasionally the Guardian, and the Sunday Times and the Observer on Sundays. And the FT. \u00b7 Ian Brown is the director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, an internet thinktank"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
