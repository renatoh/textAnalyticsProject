I'm 40 years old, have only secured a small pension and need to invest for retirement. I'm unsure of where to go for the best advice. Where should I look? TE A On July 1 a new regime governing investment advice came into force. It is supposed to provide investors with more choice and stimulate competition. Unfortunately as with so many well-meaning schemes, it has resulted in more confusion. Until July there were basically two kinds of financial advisers - tied agents who were only able to offer products from one source and independent advisers who were supposed to comb the entire market to recommend the most suitable product. Now a third category has been introduced called multi-tied agents. They can offer the products of a range of providers but do not have to scour the whole market. Most banks, for example, are now multi-tied agents. Quite frankly l would avoid the new multi-tied agents and the tied agents. They do not offer really independent advice since they are committed to promoting only certain products. Under the new regime, proper independent financial advisers have to offer the choice of paying a fee and also have to reveal the levels of commission they might make. It isn't perfect and can be costly, but it is the only way to get really independent advice. Certainly don't trust your \"friendly\" bank manager, who is pressured to earn as much commission as possible.
