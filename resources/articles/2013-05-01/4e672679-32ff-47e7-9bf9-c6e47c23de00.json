Conrad Murray was \"in desperate financial straits,\" and under legal pressure with liens against his property in Nevada, detective Orlando Martinez told a jury in the civil trial. Martinez, who investigated Jackson's 2009 death, said Murray had unpaid student loans, was behind on credit card bills and child support, and owed rent for his business. \"He may break the rules, bend the rules, do whatever he needed to do to get paid,\" Martinez said. \"It might solve his money problems.\" Martinez testified that he found most of the debts against Murray in public records. Murray, who had asked for $5m to care for the singer, was convicted in 2011 for the involuntary manslaughter of Jackson through an overdose of powerful anaesthetic propofol weeks before a planned series of 50 concerts. Jackson's immediate family accuses AEG Live, who were promoting the London concerts, of negligence in hiring Murray, failing to conduct proper background checks and going to extreme lengths to get the singer ready for the shows. Murray is not being sued. AEG Live maintains that Jackson kept his dependency on propofol secret from outsiders, that a proposed contract with Murray was never fully executed and they could not have foreseen that Murray posed a danger to Jackson. Martinez was the second witness called by attorneys for Jackson's family. A paramedic who tended to Jackson after the overdose testified on Tuesday that Murray had appeared frantic, pale and sweating but never mentioned that Jackson had taken propofol, which is typically used in surgical settings. Jackson, 50, was pronounced dead in a Los Angeles hospital on 25 June 2009, a day after a rehearsal and three weeks before the first concert on his This Is It tour. Jackson's 82-year-old mother Katherine and two oldest children, Prince and Paris, are also on the witness list later in the civil trial along with Diana Ross, Prince, Quincy Jones, Spike Lee and Lou Ferrigno. AEG attorneys said they intend to call Murray as a witness. He remains in a Los Angeles jail and is appealing against his conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
