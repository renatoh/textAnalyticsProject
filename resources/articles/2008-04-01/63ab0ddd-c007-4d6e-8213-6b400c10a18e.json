Michael Mannion, 35, a carpenter from London, came out of hiding to tell police he saw an Indian bartender, Samson D'Souza, on top of the teenager outside a beach bar hours before she died. The semi-naked body of Scarlett, 15, from Devon, was found on Anjuna beach in February. D'Souza, 28, has been remanded in custody on suspicion of rape, and Placido Carvalho, an alleged drug dealer, appeared in court on suspicion of drugging Scarlett and assisting in the murder. Yesterday Mannion said he had been assured he was not a suspect and would be allowed to leave India. \"I am a pawn in a power game and this is harassment. I turned up and showed that the investigation was fudged. So they want to get back at me by keeping me here.\" Before he testified, police had stuck to their version that the teenager had accidentally drowned. A campaign by her mother, Fiona MacKeown, now back in Devon, led to Mannion breaking cover. \"They have me on a 'look out circular', which means I cannot leave the country. My visa runs out in August and I am running out of money. Plus I have a 75-year-old father who is ill so I really need to get out and back to my life,\" said Mannion. His lawyer, Vikram Varma, said there could be a delay because the case had been handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, but also warned the \"state bureaucracy\" could slap a \"false case\" on his client. He said the British consulate could not intervene in a judicial matter. \"He could be charged with a frivolous charge and that may mean custody before we can get him out,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
