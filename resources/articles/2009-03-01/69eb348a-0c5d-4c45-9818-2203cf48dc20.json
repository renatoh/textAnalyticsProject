The heart of homeland security intelligence is this: getting good intelligence into the hands of local and state police officers so they can prevent a terrorist attack before it occurs. This means the perfectly reasonable goal of building information-sharing systems that enable a mutual flow of intelligence between all levels of government to increase the likelihood that enough dots get connected to breakup a terrorist plot. But what is good intelligence? This is where things get scary. Pioneered by the Los Angeles police department, law enforcement agencies nationwide are adopting suspicious activity reports (SARs) that task police officers with collecting and reporting information that indicates pre-operation terrorist planning. But much of what indicates terrorist planning also doubles as completely innocent behaviour such as taking pictures of buildings, bridges and monuments. The LAPD's Joan McNamara, who founded the SARs programme for the department, told lawmakers at a congressional hearing last week that there's privacy protections built in, while a DHS privacy assessment (pdf) reports \"personally identifiable information\" is marked as such so those viewing know it cannot be disclosed. In an age of rampant cyber attacks and insider misuse of information, these protections seem flimsy and warrant concern. There's also another problem: the information may or may not be accurate. According to the same DHS privacy assessment on the SARs programme: Generally, participants will not check the information for accuracy. Information may be cross referenced with other component SARs data, or verified through systems of records within an individual component. SARs data is taken \"as is\" for analysis purposes only. Any action taken on based on any SARS data in this project would be properly vetted and researched through a component's appropriate channels. And where will all this possibly accurate information go? One place is fusion centres. Created en masse since 9/11, fusion centres are run by states and localities, although heavily financed by the federal government, to collect, analyse, vet and disseminate intelligence regarding terrorism and crime to law enforcement on the ground. Fusion centres are staffed by local and state law enforcement officers as well as federal employees, such as the FBI and the department of homeland security (DHS). Nevertheless, fusion centres are under the control of the states and localities they exist in. Because of this, the federal government has no control over how fusion centres operate. Naturally, there's been a mission drift from its original counterterrorism focus. Evidence is mounting fusion centres have been abusing their authority and violating law-abiding citizens' civil rights. From 2005 to 2006, the Maryland state police, with help from DHS, surveilled non-violent anti-war and anti-death penalty groups and labelled 53 individuals and groups as diverse as the DC Anti-War Network and Amnesty International as terrorists. In February, the ACLU criticised a leaked bulletin from the North Central Texas Fusion System that concocted a crazy conspiracy theory that Muslim civil rights and anti-war activists were working together to spread sharia law inside the United States, which even if true, would not be illegal. Among the possible unwitting co-conspirators was the US Treasury department for hosting a conference on Islamic finance. According to the bulletin: Given the stated objectives of these lobbying groups and the secretive activities of radical Islamic organizations, it is imperative for law enforcement officers to report these types of activities to identify potential underlying trends emerging in the North Central Texas region. The bulletin was created using a mish-mash of rightwing and Christian websites from Human Events to Family Security Matters to the Christian Broadcast Network. What better outlets to source your official document than fundamentalist Christians and neoconservatives criticising fundamentalist Muslims. And it's not only Muslim and leftwing groups that have come under scrutiny. This month a leaked February bulletin from the Missouri Information Analysis Centre said support for independent presidential candidates like Ron Paul or an affinity for Revolutionary war-era \"Don't Tread on Me\" flags could mean you're a militia member a la Timothy McVeigh. These three examples show one thing: If you hold a political opinion outside the conventional two-party system, you're suspect. How paranoid and self-defeating it is when analysts have to wade through mountains of information that smears unorthodox political opinions when real threats to security exist. So what can be done to punish state and local fusion centre overreach? The Obama administration must be a guillotine, cutting all federal funding to centres that violate its citizens' civil rights and waste resources by targeting law-abiding citizens. Federal support should not be reallocated until state and local fusion centres follow federal fusion centre guidelines, which do not exist yet in any coherent fashion, but which the Obama administration should fashion. As Gregory Nojeim of the Centre for Democracy and Technology put it: \"There are a lot of cooks in the homeland security intelligence kitchen, and they are each using different recipes.\" It's also important for Americans to ask two broader questions. First, when does vigilance among the law enforcement establishment turn darker and create a society where its guardians see everyone as a potential terrorist? Second, how much privacy should Americans give up in return for limited security? It's easy to forget: rights forfeited are rarely returned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
