It proved, he said, that many involved in the church remained medieval in their attitudes towards women. \"It is plain to any progressive thinker that a woman is just as capable of carrying out the duties of a vicar as a man,\" the writer concluded, before adding, triumphantly: \"And the ladies would look a good deal prettier in those vestments too, methinks.\" There has been a certain amount of what I have ever since thought of as the Methinks Factor in the press coverage of the women's World Cup. Whether women feel it is a sign of the advances made by feminism that men have stopped patting them on the bottom and started patting them on the head instead I will leave for Gavin Peacock and other front-line activists to discuss, but one thing is clear: out in China the differences in social attitudes to women's football between east and west have been emphasised as boldly and unexpectedly as Sid Waddell's syllables. After North Korea's 2-2 draw with the United States, for example, the Korean coach, Kim Kwang Min, described the women in his squad as \"short and stocky, with powerful muscular legs\". It is a clear indication of how far they have gone towards abolishing bourgeois concepts of beauty in the Land of the Morning Calm that he could say this without first locking himself in a shark-proof cage. With their nifty short-passing game and thunderous shooting the North Koreans have proved themselves worthy successors to Pak Do Ik and the heroes of 1966. No one can predict how far they will go in the tournament, but I wouldn't rule out coach Kim becoming the first man publicly to say \"to be honest, skinny-leg jeans probably aren't a great look for a lady of your build\", and not conclude the observation by picking his teeth up with a broken arm. The tournament has also had its own illuminating spy scandal. Espionage is pretty much de rigueur for sports this season. We had no sooner concluded the formula one version - I will not bore you with the details of this totalitarianly tedious affair, suffice to say here that the FIA's ruling made it plain that though having a faster car is an advantage when it comes to winning the constructors' championship it is of no benefit whatsoever in the drivers' championship - than the NFL was forced to take action against the New England Patriots for secretly videoing the defensive calls of the New York Giants' coaches in an attempt to decode their playbook. This is clearly a serious business, though I cannot help wondering why US coaches are still shouting messages instead of texting them like everyone else on the planet. Why there is so much spying in sport at the moment is equally hard to fathom. In all probability it is due to the ready availability of spies now that the Cold War is over and even maverick espionage professionals like Jason Bourne prefer to enlist the help of a Guardian journalist rather than some ruthless, finely honed professional warrior. (Not, I should add, that there aren't a number of finely honed professional warriors on the staff of the Guardian, as anyone who witnessed last month's What The Papers Say British Media Ultimate Fighting Challenge at the Manchester GMEX Arena will testify. I for one firmly believe that had he not dislocated his thumb while executing a stranglehold on Brian Sewell in an early round, my colleague George \"The Monster\" Monbiot would have given Melanie \"Mad\" Phillips much more of a scrap in the final than he eventually did.) Whatever the reason for it, though, it seems no sport can get by without a spying scandal of its own. The women's World Cup is no exception. At the weekend the Danish Football Association continued to protest about an incident in which, it alleges, a pair of Chinese policemen were caught filming the Denmark squad through a two-way mirror. Here, you might have thought, was proof that Deng Xiaoping's \"open door to the west\" policy had finally borne fruit and allowed the people of China to embrace the core values of globalisation - freedom, fizzy drinks and lap-dancing - by encouraging the cops to borrow a plotline from several hundred teen gross-out movies. Amazingly though, it quickly became apparent that the Chinese policemen had not set up the two-way mirror in the changing room shower block, but in a conference room. Faced with the chance to video secretly a team of fit young female athletes from Scandinavia the Chinese had opted to home in on the squad's tactical meeting, despite the fact it offered very little possibility of nudity and none whatsoever of steamy soap-related antics. This surely represents one truly great leap forward for female sports stars, though the president of Fifa, Sepp \"Smaller Shorts, Tighter Costumes\" Blatter, will doubtless be extremely disappointed by the entire episode.
