Citizens stood with heads bowed, while cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Among the 14 health workers and police declared to be remembered was Li Wenliang, the doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d before being exonerated. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 patients who are asymptomatic are under medical observation. Fresh warnings on global economy World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. He echoed comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impacts. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008. Trump ignores latest US health advice Health officials in the US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside. But President Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying he can\u2019t see himself wearing one when he greets \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d. Melania Trump later urged everyone to take the official advice seriously. UK endures deadliest day so far It was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. US prisoners freed US attorney general William Barr has issued an emergency order for the release of more federal inmates into home confinement, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr has given priority to vulnerable inmates housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by Covid-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut, where inmates have died. The BOP said on Friday 91 inmates and 50 staff in its 122 institutions had fallen ill, though reports suggest the number of those affected is much higher. Falklands confirm first case The Falkland Islands government confirmed the territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and was now in a stable condition in isolation. Crackdown in Central America Police have detained thousands across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb coronavirus transmission. Honduran authorities said about 2,250 people had been arrested for violating the curfew imposed since mid-March while Guatemalan authorities said 5,705 people had been detained for leaving their homes without justification. In Panama, more than 5,000 people have been detained in recent weeks for violating curfew rules; another 424 people have been held for not complying with recent rules that limit men and women leaving the house on alternate days. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, 712 people have been detained for failing to comply with the mandatory home quarantine decreed by President Nayib Bukele, and have been taken to containment centres."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
