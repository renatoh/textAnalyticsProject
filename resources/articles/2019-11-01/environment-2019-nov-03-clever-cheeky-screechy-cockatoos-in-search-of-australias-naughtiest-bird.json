They are also some of the nation\u2019s smartest and most destructive. They are known to open the lids of wheelie bins, flicking rubbish everywhere while rummaging for food. They are notorious for destroying wooden window frames, decking or house fittings. They lop the tops off flowers, uproot seedlings, hollow out trees and generally make a big old mess. And they are loud. Since moving to Sydney a few years ago I have come to love this cheeky species, even befriending a local pair who have become regular, albeit occasionally raucous, visitors to my balcony birdbath. It was thanks to my familiarity with these wily locals that I was charged with the job of finding Australia\u2019s naughtiest bird as part of the Guardian/BirdLife Australia\u2019s bird of the year 2019 poll. The investigation began with a tip from a member of the public that the bird most deserving of the title was a particular sulphur-crested cockatoo, to be found somewhere in the town of Katoomba in the heart of New South Wales\u2019 Blue Mountains. Isaac Sherring-Tito, a longtime Katoomba resident, had captured footage in July of the avian fiend methodically pulling all the bird spikes off a council building and throwing them into the town\u2019s main street, leaving a long line of bird spikes littering the road. Like many witnesses to the cockatoo\u2019s antics, Sherring-Tito was on his way to partake of local culinary delicacies when he captured the incident on his smartphone. \u201cI was just on my lunch break, walking down the street to get something to eat,\u201d Sherring-Tito told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd I came back and they were ripping [the bird spikes] off.\u201d Katoomba\u2019s bustling high street contains an array of bakeries, eateries, antique shops and variety stores. When Guardian Australia arrived to investigate, it did not contain any cockatoos. But a likely suspect was certainly very well known among the locals. Seated in the morning sun outside one of Katoomba Street\u2019s many cafes, the sculptor and Katoomba resident Melanie Weine told Guardian Australia there was one cockatoo that had a habit of sitting on the bin next to a bench outside the French bread shop, waiting for unsuspecting tourists to come along with their lunch. Was this our bird? \u201cThe tourist will sit on that bench and start to feed the cockatoo a bit of his sandwich,\u201d Weine said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen the cockatoo eat that, and when the guy\u2019s not looking, take the whole sandwich and take off.\u201d She said the sulphur-crested cockatoos had become increasingly numerous over the past five years. \u201cThey\u2019re very friendly with tourists,\u201d she said. \u201cThey perform all sorts of stunts around this place.\u201d At the newsagency not far away, the proprietor, Ray Cameron, immediately recognised the bird in question. \u201cThere\u2019s one in particular that hangs around the coffee shop down here, the waffle shop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sits and people feed it.\u201d At the waffle shop, True to the Bean, the staff were frustrated. \u201cThey destroy everything. They eat chips from next door,\u201d the barista and self-described domestic goddess, Cheyenne Foong, said of the cockatoos. \u201cI get the broom out,\u201d said her colleague, the cafe owner Mel Jones. \u201cThey\u2019re very naughty.\u201d Jones agreed that the cockatoos appeared to have increased in number. \u201cWe are a really big tourist area so the tourists pay a lot of attention to them, and will feed them bread and chips to take photos with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like me particularly because I do chase them with the broom.\u201d Guardian Australia stood in front of Katoomba\u2019s various shopfronts holding some delicious baked goods, hoping to lure out this most-maligned bird, to no avail. It wasn\u2019t until we made our way up to the gardens of the posh hilltop hotel, the Carrington, with its beautifully managed botanical gardens, that we discovered there was more to the story than one bird\u2019s desire for salty carbs. The Carrington\u2019s gardener, Vicki Skeen, said the local cockatoo population were bullies. \u201cI had freesias planted around all the edges [of the garden beds], I\u2019ve been building them up for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year, they methodically went through everything bar one box [and] they threw the tops all over the ground and ate the bulbs. You can\u2019t replant them. And then when the magnolias started coming on they chewed out the tops of those and bit off all the buds before they could open. Then the echium came \u2013 they love that.\u201d Skeen was surprised by the apparent elusiveness of the usually very conspicuous cockatoos. \u201cI think probably the calendulas are coming on somewhere now, and I haven\u2019t seen them around today.\u201d \u201cTesting has shown that cockatoos are about as smart as a two-year-old human,\u201d said Dr John Martin, a terrestrial ecologist from Taronga Conservation Society. \u201cIn the animal world, it\u2019s actually one of the more intelligent.\u201d Martin said cockatoo behaviour wasn\u2019t innately naughty, because that would be to suggest the parrot had a kind of human moral compass. \u201cThese are wild birds behaving naturally, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not in the bush,\u201d he said. \u201cDid it really appreciate that what it was doing was being perceived as a bad action? Was there malice underlying this behaviour? We don\u2019t really know. \u201cThe behaviour that we\u2019ve seen is an indication of them being exploratory and inquisitive, which is fundamental to adapt to urban landscapes. If they weren\u2019t tolerant of road and noise and buildings then they wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d He said anthropomorphising the birds \u2013 seeing their behaviour through a human lens \u2013 wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as it meant people were paying attention to them and trying to understand what they were doing. Indeed, everyone seemed to have a naughty cockatoo story. \u201cThere was a cockatoo, had a reputation in Mount Isa for unscrewing valve caps on cars and pushing his beak into the valve to get the air out to cool himself off,\u201d said a retired telephone technician, Perry Langdon, in Katoomba on holiday. A local artist, Sophie Miller, said: \u201cOutside the bakery I saw two cockatoos on two separate cars pulling the rubber lining out from in between the door and the roof of the car. Both of them, on separate cars.\u201d Guardian Australia was unable to conclusively confirm that Katoomba was home to Australia\u2019s naughtiest bird but strong feelings nevertheless prevailed. \u201cThey\u2019re the clowns of the bird world, really,\u201d Weine said. \u201cWe love them. They can do anything. Nothing will stop them.\u201d Said Jones: \u201cThey\u2019re like Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s birds. They are not after human flesh but they are after the human chip.\u201d \u2022 Vote now in Guardian Australia\u2019s bird of the year poll \u2022 Do you have a naughty cockatoo story?
