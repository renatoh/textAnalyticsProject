The Pascal Bary-trained filly, a winner at Maisons-Laffitte on her reappearance, subsequently finished second in both the English and Irish 1000 Guineas, encountering trouble in running on each occasion. Six Perfections was particularly unlucky in Ireland where she finished fast but failed by a short head to catch Yesterday. Thierry Thulliez, slated for his riding of Six Perfections at Newmarket and replaced by Johnny Murtagh at the Curragh, is back in the plate on a filly refreshed after a break. Peter Harris has booked Thierry Gillet for the ride on Spinola, winner of last season's Cherry Hinton Stakes. The filly has been unplaced in her three starts this term, and clearly needs to step up a gear to be competitive here. Jamie Spencer has been booked for the mount on Tessa Reef, a Sheikh Mohammed-owned filly trained by Alex Pantall. Bright Sky, who won the French Oaks, the Prix de Diane, and the Prix de l'Opera, looks the main threat to Six Perfections. The four-year-old began her campaign on a positive note when beating all bar Falbrav in the Prix d'Ispahan. That form stands the closest scrutiny, although the drop back to a mile for a filly that has been campaigning over longer remains a slight worry. Almond Mousse, Musical Chimes, Acago, Campsie Fells and Fidelio's Miracle, complete what is a very strong domestic line up. Of these, the French Oaks third Musical Chimes and Acago, an easy winner in group three company, make most appeal. The Italian pair, Marbye and Frottola, both past visitors to Deauville, are closely matched on domestic form, but both face stiff tasks. The Godolphin team have not had their usual quota of winners in big races this season but send Highdown, who was trained by Marcus Tregoning before being switched to Saeed bin Suroor, to Munich for tomorrow's Group 1 Grosser Dallmayr-Preis, over ten furlongs. He will be ridden by Frankie Dettori. Highdown, will be opposed by Aidan O'Brien's Black Sam Bellamy, who will be ridden by Mick Kinane. The going is expected to be good and the home team looks very strong with Ransom O'War and Next Gina both in the field. Both colts have performed with distinction in German classic races this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
