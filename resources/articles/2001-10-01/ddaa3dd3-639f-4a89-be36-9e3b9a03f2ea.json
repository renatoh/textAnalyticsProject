After those 5-0 and 7-1 defeats to Everton and Blackburn I can guess what the players at Upton Park are thinking. They'll be looking at Glenn to see how he reacts and if he has the ability to deal with the pressure and turn the situation round. Some will be saying to themselves: \"Right, show us what you can do. Let's see if you're up to it.\" They ought to be asking \"Are we up to it?\" after those dreadful results, but if any blame can be deflected, players will usually go that way. Glenn's leadership is crucial now and this is where the art of strong management comes in. There's no set formula for him to follow before tomorrow's massive game at home to Southampton. He can only assess from being in the camp what is required. But if he shows any signs of cracking, the players will cotton on. One of the best times I had as a manager was at West Brom when, on the back of a successful season, we were really struggling at Christmas. Laurie Cunningham and Len Cantello had left and three key players were injured, but I sensed we weren't a bad side and I never flapped, and that confidence rubbed off on the team. I kept encouraging them and telling them not to panic and everything turned at Crystal Palace, where we were 2-0 down with eight minutes to go and came back to draw. If we'd lost we might have gone down but we went on to lose about one of the last 19 and finished in the top half. What Glenn has in his favour is a squad with far more quality than many of the other strugglers. He has Paolo di Canio, Freddie Kanout\u00e9, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Trevor Sinclair at his disposal. Of course it doesn't help his cause that Sinclair has asked for a transfer. Glenn was always going to have to prove himself to the players very quickly, particularly as he wasn't the club's first choice and I think several experienced guys didn't take too kindly to the appointment of a fledgling manager. Sometimes that type of player responds more to an experienced manager than to someone who is cutting his teeth, and also I felt it would be difficult for Glenn because a lot of the squad had an affinity with his predecessor Harry Redknapp. Harry had nurtured a few and taken a chance on others when no one seemed interested. He bought Di Canio when the Italian's career could have gone completely off the rails after the incident with Paul Alcock; he went in for Kanout\u00e9 when a lot of English clubs had looked and not gone with it. Harry was bright and bubbly and on certain occasions I felt West Ham really went out and played for him. I think his departure will have been a shock to the system for a lot of the players. Glenn had to overcome that and it was significant that his first signing was David James, whom he worked with at Watford. I thought Shaka Hislop wasn't a bad goalkeeper but it may have been a move by Glenn to get in players who knew him well. I think he felt he had to make a statement and that was it. James got injured with England before he could play for West Ham, so fate conspired against Glenn there. But my first reaction was that I wasn't sure his was a good appointment. If I was running a multimillion-pound enterprise I don't think I'd want inexperienced people at the helm. Glenn finished as Watford manager in 1996 and, although he was coaching at West Ham, there's a big difference between that job and managing at the top level. As a coach you'll often be friendly with the players, as manager you have to keep a distance, with you taking the rap. It's about selection and holding your nerve. Sometimes you have to be ruthless and make decisions which will be very unpopular. You have to be brave enough to make those decisions and stand by them. Glenn has to hope West Ham stand by him. They will see other clubs making changes and might wonder whether they should do the same. Though they'll want to give Glenn time, they know they have to safeguard their Premiership future. I'm not saying Glenn's time is definitely up. I saw West Ham in the first game at Liverpool, where they played very well and might have got something had it not been for Michael Owen's brilliance. But Glenn's got to rally the players and do superbly in the next couple of matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
