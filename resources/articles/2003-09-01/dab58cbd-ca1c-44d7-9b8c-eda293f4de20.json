The Irishman announced before York's Ebor meeting last month that he was taking an indefinite break from the saddle to combat weight problems. But Alamshar's trainer, John Oxx, said yesterday: \"Johnny Murtagh is fit and well and intending to be back in action at Limerick. As regards the weekend and the Champion Stakes, we'll just have to wait and see.\" Aidan O'Brien landed the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh for the third time in the last four years yesterday with Necklace. Old Deuteronomy did best of O'Brien's trio in fourth in the Prix Morny, the Group One race in Deauville, which was won by the outsider Whipper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
