The dominance of eternity over the temporal is an increasingly unappealing prospect in a world which offers such palpable and material joys. The afterlife appears even more pallid, even repugnant, to those who might once have aspired to its deferred blessings. Whatever the disadvantages of the here-and-now of consumerism, there is scant yearning for their replacement by a revival of the everlasting feast. The subjective experience of human beings in the struggle over sexuality, slowly and over centuries, disconfirmed joyless teachings that consigned so many people to damnation in the next world after imposing acute misery, persecution and criminalisation in this one. The pope's concession to the environment is perfunctory and superficial \u2013 \"Yes, the tropical forests merit our protection\" \u2013 and subordinated to \"the human being as a creature (which) merits no less protection \u2013 a creature in which a message is written which does not imply a contradiction of our liberty, but rather the condition for it.\" In other words, the salvation of humanity is dependent not upon the preservation of the wasted and used-up resource base of the earth, but upon recognising the stark distinction between male and female, lest a blurring of these categories engulfs the whole world in a chaos of promiscuous androgyny and sex separated from procreation. It is perhaps too much to expect a church obsessed with sex to place the threat to human survival with the waste and depletion of the earth, living as though there were no tomorrow (either terrestrial or celestial), but to seek to equate environmental degradation with the spoiling of the formulaic \"lifetime bond between a man and a woman, as a sacrament of creation which the Creator instituted and Christ then welcomed into the story of his covenant with humanity\". It is also unlikely that a religion that gave human beings dominion over nature, the conquest of which has been one of its proudest achievements, is going to contribute anything very helpful to the discussion of the relationship either between humanity and the earth, or the social and economic (as opposed to sexual) relationships between people on it. What vision of shadowy contagion lurks in the gloomy monumentalism of the Vatican - is it some imagined proselytism of homosexuality or the erosion of the antique impermeability between male and female? What disordered fears rise up out of the dark corners of its baroque splendour, and what antique superstitions still hover around the musty documents in the museums of pontifical infallibility, that these can be disturbed from the ageless torpor in which they have dwelt, and sent out to cow and frighten a bewildered world once more? We are living in an age where other-worldly beliefs are on the march again, rushing to fill the spaces evacuated by secular ideologies. The pope is in the forefront of a malign promise that eternal truths can relieve the intractable and highly material sorrows of the world; a project calculated to lead to fresh wars of religion, only this time, fought with weapons of a destructiveness which even the gods have hitherto forborne to us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
