The movie moguls are planning to bring Finding Neverland - the 2004 movie they produced about Peter Pan author JM Barrie - to the New York stage in 2010. This will be followed by a theatrical adaptation of Pink Floyd's The Wall, in collaboration with the band's co-founder Roger Waters and Billy Elliot screenwriter Lee Hall. Also in the pipeline are musical versions of Shakespeare in Love, for which the Weinsteins are hoping that Tom Stoppard will again come on board, as well as Cinema Paradiso and Chocolat. Juliette Binoche, who played the lead role in the latter movie, is in talks to star in the stage version."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
