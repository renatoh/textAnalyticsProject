This horrifying statistic is behind the Love Food Hate Waste campaign launched this month, aimed at getting us to rethink our wasteful ways. The rotten truth is that we have developed a lifestyle of buying, cooking and binning too much. School subjects such as maths, geography, food technology, English and citizenship can help to lift the lid on this economic and environmental outrage. A press release by Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) outlines the extent of a problem that sees a staggering \u00a38bn worth of food being thrown away annually (www.wrap.org.uk/wrap_corporate/news/food_waste_is.html). Most of it ends up in landfill, producing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The benefits of halting such waste could be the equivalent of taking one car in every five off UK roads, according to Dr Liz Goodwin of Wrap. Ask students to study the press release, extracting their own list of shocking facts. Start a school campaign to heighten awareness, eg bold posters for the canteen, a quiz to introduce an assembly or designing informative computer screensavers. Waste audit Most people have no idea how much food they throw away. Encourage students to measure the size of their own problem by organising an audit of waste in school, including food thrown out by the kitchens and by the students themselves. Some general tips on conducting a waste audit can be found at www.derbyshiredales.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C52A4475-C2B0-4084-84A1-8F2E3EA24CC1/0/Wasteauditlessonplanandworksheets.pdf. Follow this up by considering what their measurements reveal, and how they multiply out to give monthly and annual figures. Students can translate these figures into non-standard measurements to help people envisage the amounts involved, eg so many elephants or baths full of waste. Now students can begin to discuss ways to move towards reducing the waste. The Lunchbox Challenge is one idea from www.recyclenow.com/news/your_news/three_valleys.html. Students can find other ideas at www.recyclezone.org.uk/tz_whatucando.aspx. Challenge them to create some targets and actions for their own school. If your school is working on a whole-school food policy (web.data.org.uk/data/secondary/pdfs/whole_school_food_policy.pdf), consciously build in measures to cut down on waste . Encourage students to research how much food is wasted at home. Devising a simple questionnaire will help them identify the reasons behind the waste. Students may find Wrap's presentation helpful in composing their questions (www.wrap.org.uk/applications/publications/publication_details.rm?id=698&amp;publication=4658&amp;programme=wrap). Ask students to write a simple report on their observations and the results of the questionnaire, as well as forming conclusions on the nature of the problem and suggestions for how to minimise it. A starting point for ideas is given at the end of this report http://politics.theguardian.com/green/story/0,,2204010,00.html. One significant step, both at school and at home, is composting food waste. Give students research material on composting (eg investigating www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2005/11/02/why_compost_fea ture.shtml), then ask them to write advice leaflets on how to compost successfully. Provide a real audience by sending the leaflets home or displaying them in the local library. Making better use of leftover food is another constructive step. Some firm family favourites, like bread and butter pudding and bubble and squeak, derive from using up leftovers. Read the article on using up food and watch the video found at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7071501.stm. As part of a food technology lesson, ask students to create a recipe using leftovers. Invite local Women's Institute members, who are also supporting the campaign, to be involved (www.womens-institute.co.uk/standard.aspx?id=9173). Having planned their recipe, they can present their ideas in different ways, either like an illustrated cookery book, or perhaps as a celebrity chef, with a partner filming the making of the dish. Again, provide a real audience, eg by including recipes with the school newsletter or showing student videos during parents' evenings. Supermarkets have a particular problem in disposing of food they do not sell. One group of people has drawn attention to this by raiding supermarket bins and living off the food they find. Show students a BBC video of \"Freegans\" at work (http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=av&amp;q=freegan&amp;edition=i&amp;scope=all). FareShare works to redistribute surplus food to those who need it (www.fareshare.org.uk/about/facts.html). Ask students to contact local supermarkets to find out what they are doing to reduce waste. \u00b7 Teachers and students will find a complete KS3 lesson plan on food waste on the Guardian's daily newsdesk for schools, www.learnnewsdesk.co.uk Curriculum links Citizenship 1a, c, 2a, d, f, h, j, k; geography 6, f-g, j-k; D&amp;T 1a-d, 2a, f; English (En1) 1a-e, 2a-e, 3a-f, 4a, c; (En2) 2a-d, 3a-g; (En3) 1a-e; maths (Ma3) 4a-b (Ma4) 1a-g, 2a-b Key stage 3 Citizenship 1h-i, 2a-c, 3a-c; D&amp;T 1a-e, 2a-c; English (En1) 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-c, 4a; (En2) 1a-d, 4a-c, 5a-d; (En3) 1b-k; geography 5a-b, 6f, j-k; maths (Ma3) 1a-c, 4a; (Ma4) 1a-d, 3a, 5a-c Key stage 4 Citizenship 1a, f, j, 2a-c, 3a-c; English (En1) 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-c, 4a; (En2) 1a-d, 4a-c, 5a-d; (En3) 1b-k; geography 5a-b, 6f, j-k; maths foundation (Ma3) 1a-c, 4a; (Ma4) 1a-d, 3a, 5a-c; higher (Ma3) 1a-c, 4a; (Ma4) 1a-b, 3a, 5a-b Scottish links English language (levels C-F); environmental studies (levels C-F); maths (levels C-F)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
