Steve Holliday, chief executive, said the programme of heavy investment would sustain the company's strong performance which saw interim profits rise by more than a fifth to \u00a3757m. National Grid recently completed the acquisition of the Keyspan energy business in the north-east of the US, putting the group in second place in the US energy delivery market in terms of customer numbers. National Grid, which runs electricity and gas transmission networks in the UK, is responsible for balancing the country's electricity supply and demand. Earlier this week it asked power generators to step up output through a mechanism known as notification of insufficient system margin (nism). Holliday said National Grid had issued five nisms to date in 2007 against a recent annual average of around eight or nine and more than 40 six years ago. The nism mechanism was a tool designed to ensure that National Grid could be confident that a comfortable margin of supply over peak demand was available and which had been used very successfully, he said. \"You can expect us to be very diligent around this area,\" Holliday added. He noted that at the beginning of the winter the margin had been around 23% and, despite problems at two nuclear power stations, it was still about 19%. As well as completing the acquisition of Keyspan in the first half of the year, National Grid sold its UK wireless business and its Australian interconnector, Basslink for a combined total of \u00a33.1bn. The group is looking at the possible disposal of its property arm which owns more than 500 sites and has one of the largest portfolios of \"brownfield\" sites in the UK. The business makes more than \u00a360m a year for National Grid. The group has spent more than \u00a31bn on a share buy-back programme and said that it was on track to return a further \u00a3900m over the next 12 months. The interim dividend is being increased by 7% to 11.7p a share. \"These results are solid but in line at the operating level,\" analysts at Credit Suisse said. Last night National Grid shares closed up 1p at 781p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
