The most indecipherable dichotomy in my case during a lifetime of sporting observation is why I remain incorrigibly seduced by the greasepaint world of professional boxing while trying my hardest to hide my guilt. This is hardly just a reiteration of the worn clich\u00e9 that surfaces whenever a boxer is gravely injured, or worse, in the ring. We know it is hard to justify a sport in which the primeval intention is to batter an opponent's brain for the entertainment of an insensitive public. Boxing excites me, let's get that out of the way. I like boxers - their courage, innocent sense of ambition in many cases, vulnerability and the outpouring of sentimentality that causes them to hug their adversary who only minutes before they had tried to knock unconscious. I wrote a book about them, especially those who fought for a pittance in the years between the two world wars. Medical supervision was often negligible. The wan scrappers fought in smoky improvised rings for a fiver a time. I knew one who would get through three bouts a night. But it seems to me there has always been too much deceit and manipulation in boxing. The crowds were only searching for a semblance of working-class glamour and frisson in that drab aura of national depression. In those semi-regulated days results were on occasions rigged, sometimes without the knowledge of both boxers. Match-making and last-minute weight fiddles could be a mockery. Blatant bias by referees led to \"hometown\" wins, frequently in risible contravention of what was on the scorecard. Today the ritual of boxers' mutual antagonism has become repetitive and meaningless. The fighters glare at each other at the weigh-in, trading obscenities and even a suggestion of physical confrontation as if a blood-smeared dress rehearsal is on the way. All this, the build-up of orchestrated hyperbole and then the hovering spot-lights and brash music on the night is far more theatre, however noisy and seedy, than sport. The boxers make their slow, bellicose steps to the ringside, conscious of the TV cameras, the meretricious air of showbiz and their own need to be pensive warriors as they play their part in the compelling scenario. Bristol, where I live, has undeniable boxing roots. Here the great, brave bareknuckle fighters had their interminable bouts on the commons and open spaces, watched by royalty, by Byron the poet and Hazlitt the essayist. Some, not all, survived and were well remunerated. One famous champion, butcher's son John Gully, ended up an MP and owning a Derby winner. As a young wartime schoolboy I went to watch a three-round exhibition given by the middleweight champion Jock McAvoy for the local troops. He belted his opponent without mercy it seemed to me - and then the two, both in the RAF, wandered off together to share a fag. I was left, still wincing, for weeks. But I was also hooked, despite the sheer violence involved and uncertainty about how much the body and head could stand. My wife was shocked some years later when I queued for 30 minutes for Tommy Farr's autograph. The boxers were all so polite and gentle-voiced away from the ring. This contrast in their demeanour only added to the sport's permanent riddle. Paradox brings us to Joe Calzaghe, unbeaten for 45 fights and the sport's longest reigning world champion. In his own time and with his friends around him he is preparing for his final bout, probably now in November, against Roy Jones Jr. To the outsider he appears to have gone into the DIY business, with customary and timely close-at-hand help at least from his trainer, who also happens to be his dad, Enzo. Joe is already a wealthy man and knows how to hold on to it. That business brain suggests he cannot wait to become a promoter. Around the streets of Newbridge, as he does his road-work, his face bears few scars from those 45 fights. I shall no doubt be glued to the radio to listen to his fate against Jones - just as I was, to a cumbersome wireless on the kitchen table as my father brought me downstairs in the early hours to discover just how close Farr was to beating Joe Louis. It is a rough, gory addiction, not really to be recommended. My reservations continue to lurk. I remember, still too graphically, when as a young reporter I covered a boxing bill and took my place with a hint of self-importance at the ringside. It was only when I got home that I faced justifiable family wrath. My shirt was spattered in blood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
