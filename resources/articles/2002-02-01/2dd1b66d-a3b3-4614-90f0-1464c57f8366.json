A successor has yet to be named but for an interim period Nichols's duties will be assumed by the team's managing director G\u00fcnther Steiner, who arrived from Ford's world championship rally team only in November. A statement from Jaguar racing yesterday indicated that they and Nichols \"have jointly agreed that there is a need for the design and development activities of the company to receive fresh impetus and direction. Accordingly Steve has tendered his resignation with immediate effect.\" Nichols was hired in December 2000 by the then new chief executive officer Bobby Rahal, who was fired last summer after losing a political battle with the former world champion Niki Lauda, now the team principal. With only four weeks to go before the start of the season it looks as though Nichols is being blamed for the poor testing form being demonstrated by the new Jaguar R3. However, Lauda is known to be keen to recruit younger, more dynamic engineers to kick-start a more competitive programme. Thus the 54-year-old American had to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
