I hold the gift. My smiling but anxious friend looks on. I pull off the wrapping paper. It's a book: a new title, a new author. I'm thrilled. I love books. I turn this precious gift over in my hand, feel its promise, glance at its dust jacket. I don't read all the blurb, just enough to feed my anticipation before I can get the book home and the adventure can begin. But then it happens. The friend utters the killer words that will curse the gift for ever: \"I had to get you a copy. It's just so you.\" So me! Crunch! Flop! Aghh! Instantly, the book loses its power. Now it's destined to join a growing pile of unread books and unwatched DVDs, all handed over with that same horrible curse: \"This is so you.\" In younger, more naive days, I used to feel obliged to read books chosen by friends, these \"very me\" gifts. It was always painful. More often than not, I found I had no connection with the book at all. And suddenly a whole friendship was in question. How could this person, whom I'd shared the years with, think I would have any connection with these dull characters, this banal theme, this lame humour? Now I saw that they knew a completely different me, an imagined me - the me who would like this awful book. Occasionally, of course, I'd enjoy the book. But even then, I wasn't satisfied. Ungrateful bastard that I am, I'd be left with a nagging thought: \"Am I so predictable, so obvious in my taste, that my dear friend knew this book was going to be so very me?\" And so, over the years, I became resigned to the fact that these \"very me\" gifts brought nothing but unhappiness. Today, older, wiser and grumpier, I don't even risk taking a look at them. But I'm a working writer. Books come through the post, with covering notes from film and TV producers: \"I'd love you to adapt this book for the screen. It's very you.\" Then I read the dust jacket - which, inevitably, outlines a story of queers, transsexuals or heroin, or all three - and my heart sinks. In movieland, it seems, writers can be as typecast as any actor. No one's going to ask me to adapt Jane Austen. Regretfully, I turn down the movie adaptation and my dreams of a pool in LA fade to nothing. Everywhere you look, the culture industry is tapping into and accelerating this process of predefining our tastes. I order a book from Amazon and five other suggested titles flash up in accordance with my consumer profile. I listen to one track on a pop website and next I'm offered the chance to click some option that will ensure that, in the future, I only listen to music by similar artists. If I order a ticket for a piece of contemporary orchestral music, the ticket agency's database registers me as \"contemporary\". Such musical events are then marketed my way for ever more. To a certain extent, this suits the way most of us consume culture. Our choices are often tribal. When I was at school, I'd scour the NME for band names to write on my school bag - an indication that I understood the rules, that I belonged to a tribe. Travelling on the tube, I watch commuters holding their paperbacks in front of their faces, defining their membership of a tribe: I'm reading feminist fiction; I'm a Trekker; I'm really rather cultured; I'm reading George Eliot. But surely the greatest thrill of culture is when it presents us with the unexpected, when it challenges and expands our sense of ourselves? Struggling to pay the bills 20 years ago, I applied for a number of evening jobs. I found myself as an usher at the Coliseum, home of the English National Opera. Up until that point, I'd shared the inverted snobbery that most of the population feels towards opera. But now, obliged to sit at the back of the auditorium and watch opera night after night, I discovered a fantastic medium, a whole new area of human experience that I would otherwise have denied myself because I wouldn't have considered it \"very me\". I recently came across Alice Munro's book The View from Castle Rock. I was delighted to encounter such a major writer, a writer with a sure hand and a clear eye. I bought a pile of her previous work and tucked in. Buzzing with my new find, I mentioned Munro to a friend, who is a huge reader and with whom I often discuss books. \"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"She's great. I've read loads of her stuff.\" So why had he never recommended her? \"Well, I suppose because she's sensitive, detailed, understated. She's not, you know, very you.\" I've made a resolution. I'm re-gifting all the unread books and unwatched DVDs, wrapping them up and redistributing them. But as I hand them over, I'll be careful to say: \"Take a look at this. You might not like it. But you never know. Give it a go.\" It's the only way not to ruin a book and to maintain a friendship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
