But how to brave dropping temperatures and still enjoy activities like running, cycling, yoga or a HIIT session? Wearing the right gear, for a start. Here are six tips to help you get dress like a pro for an outside workout. Base layers are crucial Those long-sleeved tops are beloved by runners for a reason. They provide a thin layer of warmth but also, as you start to warm up, they \u201cwick\u201d away the sweat from your body, meaning you\u2019re both more comfortable during your workout and you don\u2019t get cold as you cool down. Cold sweat on the skin quickly reduces the body\u2019s temperature and, in extreme cases, can lead to hypothermia. If you are tempted to move a less sweaty mat-based exercise like yoga or pilates outside, in order to get some fresh air, a base layer would work worn with a hoodie and leggings. Don\u2019t wear too many layers If it\u2019s cold outside, you wrap up warm, right? Not if you\u2019re planning on exercising \u2013 the body will warm up even in colder temperatures. This is where light layers come in \u2013 gilets, fleeces and the like. A down gilet may be enough to wear with just a base layer for a run or a HIIT session, while a fleece or hooded jacket could work well for yoga or as an extra layer while cycling. Fleeces are also quite fashionable at the moment, so that\u2019s a bonus \u2013 there are plenty to choose from. Remember to take layers off as you get too hot \u2013 again to avoid the risk of hypothermia from wearing cold, wet clothes. Avoid cotton If cotton is a more pleasant fabric to wear on a day-to-day, it\u2019s not the right thing to wear when working out \u2013 particularly as the layer closest to your skin. It dries slowly, making it incompatible with you getting your sweat on. Instead, experts recommend polyester, nylon and polypropylene, which, apparently, dry 50% faster than cotton. More natural and sustainable alternatives are made from bamboo and merino wool, or \u2013 with a wash \u2013 secondhand items are an option, too. Dress for the wet as well as the cold A good waterproof jacket is an investment \u2013 or the one you used to use for cycling to work can be redeployed here. As for other layers, some recommend wearing a small plastic bag on your feet inside your socks to keep them dry if \u2013 for example \u2013 you\u2019re doing a pilates bridge on dewy grass. If you do get wet, change into dry clothes as soon as possible \u2013 some people suggest taking a set of dry clothes with you to the park \u2013 to avoid catching a chill. Accessories are essential For anyone too scared by the wrath of their yoga teacher to sport anything other than bare feet in a studio class, your time is now. Yoga socks \u2013 the ones with the grippy soles \u2013 are essential to avoid both cold tootsies and potentially slipping on a mat in an outside setting. Meanwhile, Runners World says that gloves should be the first thing you reach for as the temperatures drop \u2013 even while you\u2019re still combining them with shorts and a T-shirt. Some experts even suggest wearing latex gloves under your outer gloves to stay warm and dry. Light beanies or headbands are recommended for mat-based exercise and, for all-weather cyclists, overshoes \u2013 worn as an extra layer on top of cycling shoes \u2013 are a winter favourite. Stand out Winter means a drop in temperature but also fewer hours of light \u2013 the sun sets at about 4.30pm at the moment. That means you need to be visible, whatever the outside exercise you\u2019re partaking in (night-time pilates anyone?). Reflective jackets fulfil that function, while also looking like something from the future. Alternatively, some products double up in usefulness \u2013 a reflective beanie, for example, keeps you warm and visible, and some are quite subtle \u2013 lots of cycling gloves, for example, tend to have flashes of reflective fabric. You could also invest in a head torch if you\u2019re really committed to after-dark exercise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
