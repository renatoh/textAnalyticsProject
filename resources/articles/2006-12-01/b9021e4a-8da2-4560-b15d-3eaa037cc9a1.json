We have a rightful cause,\" he said. \"Threats will not deter us. Manoeuvres and ultimatums will not terrorise us.\" Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah's leader, called for a mass protest in Beirut today to force out Mr Siniora's western-backed government. Speaking on Hizbullah's television station, al-Manar, Mr Nasrallah called for the government to be replaced with a \"political partnership\" comprising both government and opposition figures. \"A national unity government should be formed. All the Lebanese, from the various regions and religions are invited to take part in the peaceful, civilised popular protest to express our beliefs ...\" he said. The government dismissed the protest as a Syrian-Iranian plot. \"It will not succeed; we are not going to resign under a fatwa from Iran or the Ba'ath regime in Syria,\" Marwan Hamade, the communications minister told the Guardian, Lebanon's Shia parties, Amal and Hizbullah, will be joined by supporters of Christian opposition leader Michel Aoun, who commands the country's biggest Christian following. The protest organisers said their supporters would remain on the streets until their demands were met. \"We are planning a permanent presence until the cabinet resigns, and there will be further actions that will be announced,\" said a senior member of Mr Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement. Six opposition ministers, including two from Hizbullah, resigned from the cabinet earlier this month after failing to secure a representation for their Christian allies. Some opposition members have threatened mass resignations from administrative posts as well as from parliament in tandem with the protest. The political crisis reached deadlock last Saturday when the cabinet met to approve an international tribunal to try Lebanese and Syrian security personnel accused of killing the former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri in February 2005. The decision to hold the session without Shia representatives was denounced by the opposition as \"unconstitutional\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
