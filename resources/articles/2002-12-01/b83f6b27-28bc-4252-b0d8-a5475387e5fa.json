David Higgins, who is currently the managing director of the Lend Lease Group the Australian company behind the giant Bluewater shopping scheme in Kent, is to be the new head of English Partnerships. The appointment of Mr Higgins, who has taken a pay cut of more than \u00a3800,000 to do the job, has prompted criticism from environmental campaigners, who point out that Bluewater-style developments are unsustainable and undermine established town centres. It comes after English Partnerships was given an expanded role after last summer's spending review to promote an urban renaissance and new sustainable communities. Friend of the Earth corporates campaigner Craig Bennett said: \"Bluewater is not something that is going to deliver a sustainable development in the UK or an urban renaissance. It is the exactly opposite of that.\" \"People will assume that he (Mr Higgins) thinks that all development is sustainable development which is clearly wrong. He has a challenge to show that he has moved on from that kind of thinking.\" Neil Sinden, policy director of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, said: \"We would be concerned if this signals that English Partnerships was going to be interested in promoting out-of-town developments of the kind that Lend Lease and David Higgins have been promoting.\" \"I would be pleased if Mr Higgins has undergone a Damascene conversion in relation to the issue of urban renaissance in preference to out-of-town development.\" Mr Higgins said he understood the opposition to out-of-town shopping centres. But he insisted that Bluewater had helped regenerate north Kent and had been planned to ensure that it did not undermine existing town centres. He said: \"You have to ensure that you don't damage surrounding communities or the high street.\" Mr Higgins, a 49-year-old Australian, who earned more than \u00a31m last year, said he took the job - advertised at \u00a3140,000 - because he felt he had something to contribute to regeneration in Britain. \"Regeneration has become a personal passion in recent years and I am extremely pleased to be given the opportunity to lead England's national regeneration agency. Although Lend Lease is associated with Bluewater in Britain, it has international reputation for delivering regeneration after developing a run down area of Sydney for the 2000 Olympics. Announcing the appointment, EP's chairwoman, Margaret Ford, said: \"We are particularly pleased that David will be joining us, as his breadth of expertise in property development and regeneration is unparalleled.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
