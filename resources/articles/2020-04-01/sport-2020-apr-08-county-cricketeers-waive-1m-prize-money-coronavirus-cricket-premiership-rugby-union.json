After a week of talks over the financial impact of Covid-19, the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association announced on Wednesday that an agreement to cover the months of April and May \u2013 the portion of the season already written off \u2013 has now been reached. More than half this year\u2019s prize money has been ceded by the players, with the understanding that all contracts will adopt the latest terms and anyone released by their club at the end of the season \u2013 around 130 deals are said to be up \u2013 will get support. The union has also established that any pay cuts during the next two months will be \u201cconsistent with reductions made to other non-playing staff at their county\u201d and said that any requests to furlough players in the short term will be accepted. The majority of counties are expected to make use of the government\u2019s job retention scheme for their playing squads, with Essex, Leicestershire and Kent having now joined Yorkshire and Worcestershire as clubs to have confirmed this. Daryl Mitchell, the Worcestershire batsman who serves as the PCA chairman, said: \u201cThe understanding from our players and the willingness to help has been particularly heartening. Like many industries, cricket recognises the challenges it currently faces; the players have been alert to the need for them to play their part. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic will continue to put financial pressure on the game and this initial two-month agreement will support the game for the period of April and May.\u201d Last week England\u2019s centrally contracted men announced a joint \u00a3500,000 wage donation back to the ECB and selected \u201cgood causes\u201d, while the women have taken pay cuts in line with those of their support staff. Meanwhile, Premiership Rugby has suspended this season indefinitely but still hopes to play it to a conclusion even though there are nine rounds of the regular campaign remaining and two play-off weekends. Last month the clubs paused the season for five weeks, hoping to resume at the end of next week, but there was no chance of that happening with the government expected to extend the lockdown beyond next Monday and players needing a couple of weeks in training to regain full fitness. Premiership Rugby\u2019s board announced on Wednesday that the suspension would go beyond 24 April but did not set a date for when it aimed to restart the tournament, saying that first it would seek approval from the government and Public Health England. \u201cThe intention is to play all the games and complete the season as soon as it can be done safely,\u201d Premiership Rugby said in a statement, although that would take three months and probably mean the start of next season being put back. \u201cWe are further postponing the current season and we are exploring with the Rugby Football Union opportunities to reschedule the Premiership final later in the year with a minimum of 2,500 tickets to be donated to NHS and essential workers.\u201d The desire to complete the season is driven by the need to fulfil the contracts with the broadcaster BT and the title sponsor, Gallagher. All the clubs have been forced to put some staff on furlough and players at 11 of the 12 in the top flight have taken 25% pay cuts with income all but drying up. Some club would be in danger of collapsing if BT, which is freezing sports subscriptions for its viewers for two months, asked for a rebate. But restarting the season in the summer could lead to a clash with the international game if the July tours are put back and postponed Six Nations matches rearranged. \u201cWe have agreed on our approach to restart rugby after a series of constructive meetings with our clubs, investors, players\u2019 representatives, commercial and broadcast partners and the Rugby Football Union,\u201d said Premiership Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Darren Childs. \u201cThis is not an easy conversation. We are dealing with a catastrophic pandemic that is unprecedented in our lifetimes, the effects of which are heartbreaking and devastating. We also must recognise that when the pandemic is finally at an end, there will still be an economic challenge for many years to come. \u201cI am proud of how our clubs, staff and players have pulled together to make swift and dignified decisions to preserve the sustainability of their independent businesses in order to meet the challenges ahead. We are creatively working with the government and medical professionals to come back promptly, as soon as we know that it is safe to do so.\u201d Premiership Rugby is looking at a number of potential restart dates. Government advisers have warned that the restriction on social gatherings is likely to continue for at least another three months, which would mean a resumption at the end of July at the earliest, even if matches were played behind closed doors. The new campaign starts in the middle of September and finishes with the Lions touring South Africa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
