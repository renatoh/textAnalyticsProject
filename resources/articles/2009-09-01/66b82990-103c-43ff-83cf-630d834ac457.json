I made the mistake of going to a new hairdresser's (or barber's, if you're a little more masculine and live in the past). It's not that the new hairdresser isn't good at her job \u2013 as haircuts for Andy McNab readers go, this is probably as good as it gets. It's just that she clearly wasn't fluent in the vague, non-committal gurgling noises I make when someone asks me how I want my hair. I begin with the obvious: \"A bit shorter,\" as if before this there was the option of her cutting it longer. She looks unenlightened, so I elaborate. \"I sort of want it a bit thinner and a bit smarter.\" Her expression becomes even blanker. \"I had it cut two months ago so maybe just take off two months of um, you know, hair?\" I hold out some of my hair as a helpful illustration. She looks at it, gives up and tells me to sit down. \"So you just want it short, basically?\" she says. I have run out of hair-related words, so I nod. At the back of my head the electric razor begins to buzz ominously. Twenty minutes later I have got what I asked for. I look like an IT consultant who owns his own paintball gun. People who see me on the street will think \"Now there's a man who's well respected on the internet.\" The usual post-haircut paranoia is amplified by the fact that this time I'm right \u2013 I do look like an idiot. When a group of girls start laughing on the train I assume one of them has done an impression of my head. I pop into a charity shop, looking for a hat. They only have one: purple, with a blue ribbon. In desperation, I try it on. I look like someone's eccentric grandmother. It's a close call, but I decide to go without. When I arrive back home my flatmate offers an obligatory \"Nice haircut\". I make a face. \"It's smart,\" he says, \"You look like you could wear a suit.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"But only to go to a war crimes tribunal.\" His girlfriend is more honest. She takes one look at me, wrinkles her nose and says \"No.\" She is, I realise, speaking for women everywhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
