Historic England announced the list as part of a campaigning project called Irreplaceable: a History of England in 100 Places. It is broken down into various categories, with the 10 places for art, architecture and sculpture. All 10 have been selected by the BBC\u2019s arts editor, Will Gompertz, from hundreds of nominations submitted by the public. There are two cathedrals on the list: St Paul\u2019s in London and the Basil Spence-designed Coventry Cathedral, which was consecrated in 1962. The latter was a replacement for its 14th-century predecessor, which was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs in 1940. Gompertz called Coventry Cathedral \u201ca magnificent, optimistic and bold response to the horrors of war\u201d. He said: \u201cTo create a modern and ambitious building dedicated to spiritual enrichment from the literal ashes of destruction was \u2013 and is \u2013 a sublime answer to brutality. It is a building born out of love and hope, made from the rubble of hate and despair.\u201d Sutton Hoo is the oldest place on the list. The burial mounds were first excavated in 1939. They revealed a 27 metre-long wooden ship buried with extraordinary treasures that helped rewrite understanding of the Anglo-Saxons. The excavated objects are on display at the British Museum and the Sutton Hoo site, looked after by the National Trust. \u201cTo look at them is to reach back and see our past made real and vital,\u201d said Gompertz. The newest place on the list is Tate Modern in London, which opened in 2000. Gompertz, who was director of Tate Media before joining the BBC, said he knew every inch of the building, the former Bankside power station. \u201cIt is a wonderful space to show art and to welcome audiences from across the globe to mingle and learn together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt breathed new life into a rundown part of London and introduced the world to a new way of showing and enjoying art.\u201d The other galleries on the list are the Barbara Hepworth museum and sculpture park in St Ives and Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, praised by Gompertz as \u201cwithout doubt, one of the finest examples of art in the landscape anywhere in the world\u201d. Antony Gormley\u2019s Angel of the North overlooking the A1 in Gateshead has become a popular national landmark since it was completed in 1998. Gompertz called it a powerful piece of contemporary sculpture that \u201cexcites, heralds and provokes\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is so far removed from the typical \u2018hero on a horse\u2019 statues that are dotted across the country, invisible to all. Gormley\u2019s artwork is as fresh as it is imposing.\u201d Completing the new top 10 are Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, once the country home of William Morris; Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, one of England\u2019s grandest stately homes; and the Minack theatre in Cornwall. All of the 10 places, chosen to stimulate debate, will be explored in depth in episodes of a podcast series created for the project, free on iTunes and Soundcloud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
