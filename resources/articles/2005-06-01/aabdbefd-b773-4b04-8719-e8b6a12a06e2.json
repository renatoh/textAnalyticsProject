Chasing down a target of 191, Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss, their Test match partnership reformed for the occasion, were merciless, Trescothick, in his hundredth one-day international, completing another century. The next delivery, from the former captain Khaled Mashud - a genuine allrounder in that he is mediocre at more than one discipline - was driven through the covers with power and precision by Strauss and, with the innings still one delivery from being halfway through, England had completed a 10-wicket win. Only a succession of rain interruptions earlier in the day prevented the crowd from avoid- ing the afternoon rush hour. Bangladesh must be sick of the sight of Trescothick. At Lord's in the first Test he made 194 in England's only innings, and followed with 152 at Chester-le-Street at more than a run a ball. Yesterday's 100, from 76 balls with 16 fours, means three on the bounce, leaving Sky viewers, who have acquired a certain eccentricity of late with their man-of-the-match voting, with little to ponder. This was Trescothick's third limited-overs hundred on this ground and the ninth of his career in such games and, having passed the eight scored by Graham Gooch, he now sits top of the England tree. Ten-wicket wins are a rarity in one-day internationals, not least by England, whose only other occasion came five years ago, at Chester-le-Street, when Trescothick, in his fourth match, and Alec Stewart added an unbroken 171 against West Indies. Trescothick's 192-run partnership with Strauss yesterday obliterated that and all England first-wicket partnerships with the exception of the 200 Trescothick and Vikram Solanki made here against South Africa two years ago, and the 193 put together a little more painstakingly by Gooch and Bill Athey against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1986. It appeared chanceless. For the first hundred or so Strauss matched Trescothick run for run before the senior partner sprinted away in the latter stages as if in possession of several more gears. Strauss's return to the top of the order, the first time he has batted there in the limited-overs form since his debut in Sri Lanka, came as a surprise as the experiment with Geraint Jones as an opener had seemed destined to be continued for the foreseeable future. Indeed, even as recently as two days ago, in the aftermath of the Twenty20 match against Australia, the wicket-keeper himself was under the impression he would be carrying on the role. Perhaps Duncan Fletcher, with his suggestion that they would know when the experiment had run its course, was just being inscrutable, though it could be resumed in the different conditions on the subcontinent this winter. Instead, given his chance, Strauss, who hitherto had been learning his trade as a down-the-order nudger and worker, was able to play with some freedom, abetted by generally shoddy bowling, and his 82 came from 77 balls, with 10 fours and a pulled six. All silver linings have a cloud, of course, and the overwhelming success of the England openers, and the upper order in general this summer, means that Andrew Flintoff, his brief appearance at the Rose Bowl apart, has not played an international innings this season. In pursuit of the confidence that comes from riding roughshod over weaker opponents a chance was spurned to spread the load in preparation for the first real contest of the summer - Sunday's encounter with Australia at Bristol - although that is an observation rather than a criticism. The England bowlers made good use of a damp grey day to run systematically through the Bangladesh batting, with a rout on the cards until some spirited resistance down the order. Jon Lewis, preferred in this match to Simon Jones (the niggle in whose right knee might have had more to do with diplomacy than a real problem) took the first three wickets on his debut and Steve Harmison took a further four, his pace and bounce on an excellent pitch too much for the visiting batsmen. Only Aftab Ahmed flourished, the teenager following his unbeaten 86 from the second Test with 51 here from 58 balls that included two sixes - one of which, off Flintoff, was as emphatic as anything seen this summer. With Mohammad Rafique he added 76 for the seventh wicket and the last wicket added a further 31. The rest, not being of the right calibre, would struggle to get a job even as human cannonballs with the Cottle and Austin circus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
