We enter the Young Vic through the back door and are led through a maze of grey corridors. We are clearly in a psychiatric institution complete with treatment rooms, library and glass-walled admin office. Finally we take our seats in a large gym where there is a coffin topped with a military greatcoat. And the play begins when Michael Sheen's Hamlet watches its interment to the sound of distant gunfire. Ian Rickson, making his debut as a Shakespeare director, has clearly come armed with a strong concept: this is Hamlet played as the Freudian dream of a disturbed in-patient. The idea of Hamlet's confinement within a hospital-cum-prison is ever present, not just through alarm bells and security guards, but through the transformation of Polonius into a note-taking clinician. And Sheen's Hamlet is a classic Freudian case experiencing what the latest Arden edition, discussing the psychological approach to the play, neatly summarises as \"fantasies concerning the need for masculine identity to free itself from the contaminated maternal body\". All this is followed through with rigorous logic. Sheen's Hamlet idealises the dead father by becoming the Ghost himself. In the play-scene, he savagely humiliates first Ophelia and then Gertrude by incorporating his blindfolded mother into the phallic action. And I attribute the fact there is a female Horatio (Hayley Carmichael) and Rosencrantz (Eileen Walsh) not to caprice but to Hamlet's desire to neutralise women's sexuality through non-threatening friendship. But the acid test of any concept is whether it liberates the play and, for me, this doesn't. It may be intellectually ingenious but its practical effect is to present the action through the prism of Hamlet's personal anxiety. If the play is the Freudian fantasy of a confined patient, it reduces the other characters to elements in his dream: Claudius, for instance, simply becomes the detested authority figure. It also makes the play as Hamletcentric as those late 19th century productions which focused exclusively on the melancholy Dane. What you lose, in short, are the play's politics and the idea that the hero's troubles are one aspect of a turbulent society initially on a war footing. We've all heard of Hamlet without the prince. Rickson virtually gives us the prince without Hamlet. All this puts the focus on Michael Sheen, who is fascinating to watch. He is intelligent, inventive and full of insights; the dismissive lines over Polonius's corpse are here imbued with the profound regret of a man who is aware he has severed ties with the analyst on whom he depended. Sheen also delivers the \"What a piece of work is man\" passage with a beautiful consciousness of human potential. But even Sheen becomes the victim of the concept by constantly isolating any word that contains a psychological clue. So we get \"O most wicked speed, To post with such dexterity to (significant pause) incestuous sheets.\" Or, to Ophelia, \"I did love you (significant pause) once.\" Or, of a skull he holds up to the gravedigger, \"As if 'twere Cain's jawbone that did the first (significant pause) murder.\" There are many more examples in a performance that glitters with restless, staccato energy and is compelling to watch but that undercuts the fluency of the Shakespearean line and thought. Given the Freudian-dream framework, the other characters are necessarily seen from Hamlet's viewpoint rather than their own, but Sally Dexter creates a fine guiltily sensual Gertrude and Vinette Robinson's Ophelia, confined in her madness to a wheelchair and singing songs composed by PJ Harvey, is truly touching. Michael Gould also lends Polonius the benign concern of the professional analyst. But, for all the palpable thought that has gone into this production, I missed much of the play's primal excitement and found myself echoing Gertrude's plea to Polonius for \"more matter, with less art\".
