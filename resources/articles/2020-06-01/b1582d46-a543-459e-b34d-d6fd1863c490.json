But until large gatherings and gigs happen again, there are small things you can do: it\u2019s an imperfect solution, but streaming Australian music can help. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. \u201cAustralian music needs all the help it can get right now,\u201d says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who\u2019ve played Sounds Australia events. \u201cStreaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
