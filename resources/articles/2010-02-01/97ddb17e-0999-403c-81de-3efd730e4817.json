Perfido", "bodyText": "Beethoven wrote his incidental music to Goethe's Egmont for a production in Vienna in 1810. Dealing with the transgressive love between the aristocratic Egmont and the bourgeois Kl\u00e4rchen \u2013 both involved in the resistance against the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands \u2013 the play has long been regarded as one of the great libertarian statements in German literature, and the score, almost inevitably, invites comparison with Fidelio, to which it forms a tragic counterpart. As a totality, it makes for occasionally awkward listening, given Beethoven's tendency to close numbers with anticipatory discords heralding speeches that are not recorded. But in addition to the famous overture, there are some remarkable numbers, including a strikingly feminist song for Kl\u00e4rchen and a passage of extraordinary nobility as Egmont faces execution. Conducted by James Judd, the performance is very grand, intense, at times genuinely ecstatic, and there are fine contributions from soprano Madeleine Pierard as a feisty Kl\u00e4rchen. The filler is the concert aria Ah! Perfido, which Pierard sings with extraordinary elegance and piercing clarity of tone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
