The chief executive, Hamish Paton, who has been in the role for less than five months, will continue in the job for another year to ensure an orderly handover to his successor. Also departing is the chairman, Stephan Wilcke, who will not stand for re-election at the company\u2019s next annual general meeting in July 2020, along with Clare Salmon, head of the remuneration committee, who said she would step down \u201cat the first suitable opportunity\u201d. The boardroom shake-up comes as the group\u2019s founder, James Benamor, used his controlling stake to push his way back on to the board, having stepped down in September 2018. Benamor\u2019s Richmond Group, which owns a 61% stake in Amigo, also secured a second board seat for fellow executive Kelly Black. Amigo is the largest provider of guarantor loans, which uses friends and family to guarantee repayments on loans to people who may otherwise struggle to borrow. It offers an interest rate of about 49.9% APR. \u201cOur read of the situation is that Benamor is clearly unhappy with the share price performance in recent months and feels he needs to take more control,\u201d John Cronin, an analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said. Benamor may have also disagreed with Paton\u2019s strategy, which included plans to introduce lower rates to lower-risk customers in order to broaden Amigo\u2019s customer base. \u201cPerhaps he sees the introduction of risk-based pricing as unnecessarily concessionary and will damage the economics of the business when Amigo already offers a mid-cost product,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cWe could continue to speculate but the bottom line is that the two men have clearly fallen out and the chairman is now a casualty for bringing Paton in/agreeing the strategy.\u201d At one stage the company was valued at more than \u00a31bn but the price has tumbled 75% since the company\u2019s shares started trading on the London Stock Exchange at 275p in June 2018. The company has a market capitalisation of only \u00a3312m. The company spooked investors earlier this year when it warned over loan growth, amid Brexit uncertainty and the threat of a fresh crackdown by the financial regulator. Its news sent its share price into a tailspin, dropping 50% in a single day in August. The Financial Conduct Authority recently completed a review of the guarantor loans sector, forcing Amigo to give more information to family and friends about the risks associated with backing loan agreements. The City regulator is looking into affordability measures across the whole subprime sector, which could spark further changes at Amigo. The outgoing chairman, Wilcke, who has been in the role since 2015, said: \u201cIt has been fascinating and gratifying to lead the board of Amigo. Clare and I will work with the board to ensure an orderly succession to take Amigo forward. I\u2019d like to thank Hamish for working with the board in implementing necessary changes during a challenging period and his continued commitment until his successor is found.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
