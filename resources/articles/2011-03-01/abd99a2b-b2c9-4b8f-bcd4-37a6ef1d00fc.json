To the left, balancing on the speaker stack, was the clearly unhinged Tyler the Creator, eyes rolling manically as he rapped. To the right another rapper, Hodgy Beats, was walking on the roof of the venue and preparing to swandive into the crowd. Right in middle were a couple of hundred hip-hop lovers getting soaked with beer, kicked in the face by crowdsurfers and subjected to a series of misanthropic lyrics by a pack of kids in ski masks. It would be nice to drop in a casual \"Welcome to Austin's South By Southwest festival\" phrase here but SXSW shows aren't normally anything quite like this. The band in question was Odd Future, an 11-piece rap collective from LA, and they were by far the biggest talking point at this year's event. In fact, you might say they were the only talking point in terms of can't-miss-it excitement and controversy \u2013 proof, some critics would argue, that SXSW is no longer the must-visit music industry bash it once was. That's not to say other musicians weren't out there creating a moderate buzz, though. The British acts who jetted to Texas on a wave of hype included Ellie Goulding, Brother, the Vaccines and James Blake \u2013 perhaps not the most ringing endorsement of UK music's health, it has to be said \u2013 while Kanye West's Saturday night show and a free-for-all Strokes gig at Lady Bird Lake felt like real events. The latter saw the New Yorkers play against a backdrop of Austin's fast-sprouting skyscrapers, with new songs from album Angles and encore fireworks thrown in. Some fans were so desperate to make it inside that they resorted to climbing over the arena fence then jumping off portable toilets. The sole security guard charged with catching them all looked exhausted. He wasn't the only one \u2013 as ever at SXSW, planning your day was a tiring event in itself, and one that required a degree of tactical thought. Do you head to a venue early to guarantee catching a band, or turn up near showtime and risk being turned away because the place has long since been filled? It's best to be decisive \u2013 while you're faffing around making personal schedules on the swanky SXSW iPhone app you might be missing an impromptu show by someone like Jack White, who popped up on Wednesday to play in the car park where his Third Man Records truck resided. They say when in Texas act like the Texans and so, strictly in the name of journalistic research, I spent a lot of time sampling BBQs and bourbon, and even more time in church. St David's Episcopal Church, which was built in the 1850s and boasted a soul food counter in the back room, hosted the naive, anti-folk love songs of Herman D\u00fcne and a spellbinding (and surprisingly heavy) performance by Minnesota Mormon trio Low. Singer Alan Sparhawk was the only artist I saw who acknowledged the Japanese earthquake, which says something about the insular nature of this festival. Less than a block from St David's is the Central Presbytarian Church, whose altar was graced by the country-ish Sea of Bees, Glasser's mesmerising polyrhythmic pop and a performance by tUnE-yArDs (one woman, Merrill Garbus) that left churchgoers scraping their jaw up off the floor. The sound in the majority of Austin's 200-odd live venues is loud yet crystal clear and this suited Garbus as she constructed her Afrobeat-influenced songs out of looped vocalisations, colliding rhythms and even the odd bit of ukulele strumming. With legs about to give way, things finally ground to a halt on the Friday when I couldn't get in to either Ariel Pink or The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, although I did end up catching the Cool Kids and Das Racist at Emo's venue afterwards. Most hip-hop acts here draw indie/hipster crowds, an exception this year being J Cole at Kiss and Fly, where skinny white kids in checked shirts were virtually absent. This might explain why the North Carolina-raised rapper got the entire venue bouncing \u2013 no offence intended to the general SXSW audience, but Radiohead fans don't have a strong reputation for bringing the party vibes. All of which brings us back to Odd Future at Scoot Inn. A liberal-baiting combination of Wu Tang Clan, the Sex Pistols, Eminem, Cannibal Ox and Slipknot, they're a group who don't fear the crowd. Whereas most artists make a polite request for \"three songs, no flash\", Tyler would leap over to the snappers gathered at the side of the stage and threaten to \"stab you blogging faggots with a pitchfork\". Angry, confused, offensive, unpredictable and bristling with an energy that can only come from teenage boredom, it was impossible to take your eyes off them. Theirs was the show of SXSW by a mile, and probably one of the best I've ever seen \u2013 proof that the Austin festival's still getting something right when it comes to mapping out the (odd) future of music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
