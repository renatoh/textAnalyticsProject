The station confessed it had to change the music strategy for its flagship London station and needed to reposition in the face of fierce competition from Heart, Radio 1 and Kiss FM. In a crisis of identity, the station said it wanted to reach out for the hearts and minds of the city's widely diverse communities using a playlist including dance, R&amp;B and rock, while maintaining its position as the number one station for the latest chart music. \"We had not taken in to account the urban differences particular to London. One size doesn't fit all and London is different to other cities. There was a feeling that the charts were dominated by pop music from TV shows last year. We were playing too much pop,\" said a spokeswoman for the station. \"But we have done a lot of work on the music since the last Rajars and have repositioned the music to be a lot broader\" she added. Capital is to appoint a dedicated music scheduler for the London station, with additional responsibility for the network's overall music policy, overseeing two current schedulers. In the meantime Keith Pringle, the group programme director of Capital, who will oversee Smith's brief until a successor is found. As part of its new policy, Capital has launched an album chart show and is to air a new rock music show. The last listener ratings figures revealed how Capital has been getting it wrong - the London station's share has fallen from 10.3% to 8.8% and its lead over its rivals, spearheaded by the Chrysalis-owned Heart 106.2FM, is at its narrowest ever. Mr Smith, the head of music and programming strategy at Capital FM, has left the statopm \"by mutual agreement\" without a job to go to. A restructure at Capital last summer created large roles for two other programming and music chiefs and is believed to have left Mr Smith without a viable remit. Mr Smith joined from BBC Radio 1 in June 2000 as programme controller of 95.8 Capital FM. He was promoted to the new role of head of music and programming strategy for Capital FM's network of seven stations as part of the restructure. The changes saw John O'Hara appointed to the top job as Capital FM network programme director and Ric Blaxill appointed as 95.8FM Capital FM programme controller, effectively squeezing out Mr Smith. Rumours abounded last year of a possible rift between himself and the station's big name presenter, Chris Tarrant. At the time Tarrant was telling anyone who cared to listen that he was quitting the station's breakfast show. He famously reversed his decision and decided to stay on for another year. But Mr Smith maintained he was \"looking forward to exploring new opportunities\" and both sides insisted his departure was amicable. \"I have always sought fresh challenges so I am looking forward to exploring new opportunities as I leave Capital during what is an exciting period for the broadcasting industry,\" he said. Capital announced its intention to rethink the role left vacant by Mr Smith."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
