It was Wales\u2019s fifth defeat in a row but the only change sees the return of Justin Tipuric, an original pick against Scotland who withdrew on the morning of the match through illness. With 23 of the squad sharing nearly 1,100 caps, only threehave been blooded by the head coach Wayne Pivac, who took over from Warren Gatland a year ago. None is a back, which is a surprise given that his mandate was to sharpen Wales\u2019s attacking game. Nick Tompkins has been dropped from the bench and like the Gloucester wing Louis Rees-Zammit will have to wait for Georgia next week. Although the uncapped Bristol fly-half Callum Sheedy is among the replacements, he comes in for the injured Rhys Patchell. \u201cWe are in this together,\u201d said Pivac on why he had not changed the side after a performance he admitted was well below what he expected. \u201cIt is a collective effort and not all about putting it on the players. We have not been flash in defence or attack and need to show an improvement. We believe we can turn this around.\u201d The Exeter prop Tomas Francis will be winning his 50th cap on the ground where he made his Test debut five years ago while the captain, Alun Wyn Jones, will be playing his 150th international. Wales lacked ball-carrying capacity against Scotland but the second-row Jake Ball is fit to take a seat on the bench. \u201cThe vibe in training has been very good this week,\u201d said Pivac. \u201cIf this is a sinking ship, the players have been very good at hiding it. We did not play a lot of rugby against Scotland and a bit of the selection is about giving players another chance because we believe we can negate Ireland\u2019s strengths. We can win against anyone.\u201d Scotland lost two fly-halves through injury against Wales, Finn Russell and Adam Hastings. Worcester\u2019s Duncan Weir will wear the 10 jersey against Italy in Florence on Saturday, his first Test start for more than four years. \u201cIt is a testament to his character,\u201d said the head coach, Gregor Townsend. \u201cHe always gives 100%.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
