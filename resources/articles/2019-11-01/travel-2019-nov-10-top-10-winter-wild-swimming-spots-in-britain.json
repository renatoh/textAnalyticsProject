This pool \u2013 part natural, part carved into the rock \u2013 offers a safer place to enjoy the chilly Cornish seas. Created in the 1930s to provide a safe pool for the people of Bude, it is supervised by lifeguards during working hours in the summer but not out of season. Friends of Bude Sea Pool, the charity that runs it, advises avoiding high tide and swimming at low tide. Head to Life\u2019s a Beach cafe for a warming cuppa afterwards. \u2022 budeseapool.org Llyn Padarn, Snowdonia national park At the foot of Mount Snowdon, near the village of Llanberis, the stunning, glacially formed Llyn Padarn is so popular it\u2019s sometimes described as the \u201clocal swimming pool\u201d. Take a dip here and you are swimming with the Torgoch, a rare type of Arctic char fish that has survived since the ice age. The lake also has a range of swim-scapes, from the shallow lagoons, where families often paddle during the summer, to deeper waters. Llyn Padarn\u2019s waters have been designated as bathing water by Gwynedd council and meet the highest EU guidelines. There is plenty of parking \u2013 paid in the village, or free at the Surflines shop \u2013 and a public toilet. \u2022 visitwales.com Lake 32, Gloucestershire For those more interested in endurance training than a quick dip, Waterland, at Lake 32 at the Cotswold country park, Lake and Beach, is a go-to swim spot for triathletes and aquathon competitors. A naturally fed lake approximately 6ft in depth, it has buoyed courses of 200, 400, 750 and 1,500 metres \u2013 though we would advise keeping your swim-time short during the lower-temperature months. Non-members can swim Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings from 5.30pm until dusk (from 2 April) as well as weekend mornings. In winter you need to be a member to swim. \u2022 ukwatersports.co.uk Loch Tay, Perthshire One of the most important things about location for a chilly winter swim is where you warm up afterwards, and Taymouth Marina with its Hot Box, an outdoor hot tub and wood-fired sauna-with-a-view, has the perfect answer to that. This facility, set in a magnificent Perthshire loch, even offers a slide that takes you right out into the lake. Last March, for the inaugural Scottish Winter Swimming championships, the sauna was adopted as a post-race gossip box for those who entered. Many of us were still wearing our race \u201csilly hats\u201d as we chatted, on an after-dip high. But it\u2019s open all year round and worth booking if you want to be sure of a spot on the warm-up bench. \u2022 taymouthmarina.com Loughrigg Tarn, Cumbria Said to be one of the warmest lakes in the Lake District, this gorgeous pool, nestled beneath the steep side of Loughrigg Fell, is often used as a drinking pond by cows, and is covered in lilies during the summer. Wordsworth described it as \u201cDiana\u2019s Looking-glass \u2026 round, clear and bright as heaven.\u201d Although it feels remote \u2013 Alfred Wainwright described it as \u201cone of the most secluded of tarns\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s actually one of the lowest and most accessible of ponds in the Lake District, reached by a short walk from a lay-by car park. For those who like to wake up under canvas and take a romantic dawn dip, there is even a nearby campsite, Tarn Foot, open from April to October. Warm up after your splash with cake or homemade lunch at Chesters by the River at Skelwith Bridge. \u2022 visitcumbria.com Portobello Beach, Edinburgh City swimming at its best, from Edinburgh\u2019s town beach. An enormous and enthusiastic community has developed round the local Facebook group here, and almost any time of the year the chances are high that if you head down to the beach and promenade and linger for a short while you\u2019ll see a few people charging down between the groynes, whooping and giggling. You can also go for a post-dip indoor shower or swim at the municipal pool on the front \u2013 though wetsuits are not allowed inside \u2013 and there is a string of good cafes for hot chocolate afterwards. We recommend Miro\u2019s. \u2022 visitscotland.com River Lugg, Herefordshire The river Lugg, which winds from Llangynllo in Powys into the Wye near Hereford, has many lovely swimming spots along its meandering course. One of the best is at Bodenham village, where its course offers both long, sandy beaches and river pools. You can reach the water\u2019s edge on a path that runs from behind St Michael\u2019s church. There are, though, plenty of other idyllic spots on the Lugg, including the two-mile stretch from Lugg Mill to Lugwardine Bridge, through Lugg meadow, one of the few surviving Lammas meadows in the UK \u2013 a relic of the open-field common grazing systems, on which livestock is not allowed to graze until after Lammas day (1 August). \u2022 visitherefordshire.co.uk Loch Insh, Cairngorms There\u2019s nothing quite like Loch Insh for a sunset swim, snatched in the pink-orange glow as the winter sun descends over the surrounding trees. The loch, at the base of the dramatic Cairngorms, has long been host to a watersports centre. It\u2019s also not far from here to one of the best Spey river-dipping spots. Warming and hearty food is available at the friendly restaurant on the shore, and there are several cabins you can rent if you want to stay the night. \u2022 lochinsh.com Frensham Great Pond, Surrey Though it may look like a natural lake, Frensham Great Pond, near Farnham in the Surrey hills, was actually dug out in the 13th century as a fishpond for the Bishop of Winchester. You don\u2019t have to be a fish, though, to want to swim in its lovely, shallow, spring-fed waters, which are inviting at most times of the year \u2013 and in winter you won\u2019t need to worry about the algal bloom that sometimes afflicts it during the hotter summer months. You might even find yourself dipping with the overwintering wildfowl, the moorhens, mallards and greylag geese that make it their home. There is a sandy beach and buoyed areas reserved for swimming. \u2022 waverley.gov.uk Janet\u2019s Foss, Malham, North Yorkshire It\u2019s said that Janet, Queen of the Faeries, resides here in a cave behind the falls. A short walk out of Malham, through a magical wooded gorge, its icy waters plunge into a natural bathing pool, cradled in a limestone valley. Winter is when you can get this place \u2013 busy the rest of the year \u2013 to yourself (there\u2019s also no danger of it drying up, as it did in a heatwave last year). Reheat at the Old Barn Caf\u00e9 in Malham, open only at weekends during the winter. \u2022 malhamdale.com * The Outdoor Swimming Society website features advice for those attempting swims like those featured here, including six tips for cold-water swimming \u2022 Taking the Plunge: the Healing Power of Wild Swimming by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan is out on 19 November (Black &amp; White, \u00a320) Looking for a holiday with a difference?
