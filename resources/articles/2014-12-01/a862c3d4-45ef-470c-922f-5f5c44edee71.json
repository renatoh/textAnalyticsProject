Next stop: the England squad. RUNNER-UP David Silva \u2013 at the centre of everything as Manchester City and a flag-shy linesman undid Palace at the Etihad. City scored with their three shots on target. STRIKE OF THE DAY Reborn Stewart Downing\u2019s fine curling distance shot. It was his fourth goal of the season \u2013 as many as he managed in his previous two seasons combined. MOST GENEROUS Three of the last four goals in Southampton v Everton games have been own goals. BEST ALL-ROUNDER Andy Carroll \u2013 scoring his first league goal for West Ham with his foot since April 2013. The previous four were headers. TIMING OF THE DAY Ipswich midfielder Jay Tabb likes symmetry. He scored his first goal in 47 games in the 47th minute against Middlesbrough. IMAGE OF THE DAY Sky\u2019s Paul Merson, getting his Southampton prediction wrong, but doing it in style: \u201cThey could probably walk under a snake with a top hat on, they\u2019re that low.\u201d REBRAND OF THE DAY Salisbury City fans voted for their reformed club\u2019s new name after administration from six fresh options. The winner: Salisbury FC. MOST FESTIVE Bradford fans tried breaking the world record for the most Christmas jumpers worn in one place. Their excuse: it was for charity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
