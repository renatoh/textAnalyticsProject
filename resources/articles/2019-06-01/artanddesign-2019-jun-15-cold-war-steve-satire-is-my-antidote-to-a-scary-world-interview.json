The artist known as Cold War Steve, whose image of Brexit Britain sinking beneath the Thames graced the cover of Time magazine this month, could have \u201cgone on Twitter and ranted\u201d. Instead he used the social media platform to share his versions of a Hieronymus Bosch-type hellscape. \u201cI know from my Twitter audience they are completely dismayed by what\u2019s happening \u2013 not just Brexit, but Trump, the rise of the far right, the increase in hate crimes. But there\u2019s something quite powerful about laughing at these people, flaying them alive with humour and sarcasm,\u201d he told the Observer. In a few days, Spencer will unveil a giant collaborative artwork at Glastonbury, where three years ago the music festival went into collective shock as the result of the Brexit referendum sank in. He has produced a book of his work, The Festival of Brexit, and has begun selling limited edition prints and giant postcards of his collages. But Twitter, where he interacts with 176,000 followers, remains his favourite showcase. His work features public figures in typically English settings \u2013 seaside towns, low-cost supermarkets, working men\u2019s clubs, car boot sales, a nostalgic place of \u201cFray Bentos pies and insipid high streets\u201d. Among the Brexit cast list are Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Theresa May, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn and the Queen. An international presence is supplied by Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. There are also a handful of figures who epitomise Britishness \u2013 Cilla Black, Noel Edmonds and, most notably, Phil Mitchell, the EastEnders character played by Steve McFadden. Mitchell appears in almost every collage created by Spencer. \u201cHe\u2019s an everyman, an observer, the hero of the pieces, the anchor to the real world. He\u2019s me looking on in disbelief, really,\u201d said Spencer. He has never had contact with the actor, \u201cbut surely someone must have pointed out that he\u2019s on the front of Time magazine? I\u2019d like to think he\u2019s got a copy in a drawer.\u201d The Time commission came out of the blue as Spencer was shopping for tartar sauce in Asda. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking I\u2019d like to do something in America, it\u2019s such a rich seam, but I didn\u2019t know how to get a foot in the door. Then this email came, asking me if I\u2019d be interested in doing an illustration for Time. The next day they said they wanted it to be the cover of the international edition. It was mind-blowing.\u201d Spencer, who usually creates his collages on his phone, often on the bus on his way to work as a probation officer, had never before worked to a detailed brief. \u201cIt was very specific. They wanted lots of cliched British references \u2013 Westminster, Big Ben, London taxis, red buses. But I thought, this is Time magazine, I\u2019m not going to be precious.\u201d He had concerns about whether his \u201cquintessentially British humour\u201d would work in the US, and whether his loyal Twitter following would regard the commission as \u201cselling out\u201d. And he was unprepared for the lengthy negotiations with Time\u2019s editors on the detail of the illustration. \u201cI\u2019d get the proofs back, with someone\u2019s face circled and the question \u2018who is this?\u2019 They didn\u2019t like the naked mole-rat coming out of a sewer. They said the image I\u2019d chosen for May was too cruel. They asked for Harry and Meghan to be included; I\u2019d never have put them in myself. And they wanted Sadiq Khan in, even though I kept telling them he\u2019s one of the good guys. So I put him in flying the Trump baby blimp, though his hand is obscured by Roger Daltrey.\u201d He worried that he was compromising too far in \u201cheated negotiations\u201d. But he insisted on keeping Phil Mitchell and Cilla, and had Prince Philip driving the bus (\u201cI\u2019m not sure they got the joke\u201d). \u201cIn the end I was happy with the result. I mean, it\u2019s the cover of Time!\u201d Spencer, 44, grew up in a socialist family in the West Midlands. His father worked at the British Leyland car plant in Longbridge; his mother later became an English teacher. He loved art as a child, but after his application to study fine art at Wolverhampton University was rejected, he had a series of jobs in factories and warehouses. Over the years, depression and alcoholism took a hold, and in 2016 he had a \u201ccomplete breakdown\u201d and attempted suicide. After a period in hospital, he began to make collages on his phone and sharing them on Twitter. \u201cIt was a coping mechanism. If I was creating things, I could focus my mind on that rather than crashing anxiety attacks.\u201d Cold War Steve \u2013 a series of images of Phil Mitchell/Steve McFadden superimposed into cold war scenes \u2013 \u201cdefinitely helped my recovery\u201d. He has not touched alcohol for more than three years. Then came the Brexit referendum. \u201cThe day after, I sat on the sofa like a husk. I could have had a relapse, back to drink and stuff, but this outlet was there for me. It certainly helped me get through it.\u201d Spencer has raised money for the mental health charity Mind from his work, contributing around \u00a310,000 so far from sales of postcards, Christmas cards and other items. \u201cI\u2019ve never before been able to have any influence. Mind helped me, so as things have started to pick up, I wanted to do something \u2013 both financially and promoting discussion around mental health issues.\u201d He is currently on unpaid leave from the probation services. \u201cIt was getting quite hard to juggle a stressful job with this.\u201d His wife Katy works long hours at a care home, and the couple and their three daughters live in a small rented house in Sutton Coldfield. Katy \u201ckeeps me grounded\u201d, he said, and his eldest daughter, who is 13, finds her father\u2019s new public exposure \u201ctotally embarrassing\u201d. Spencer still sketches out collages on his phone, but now uses a tablet and laptop to finish his pieces. He works at a small kitchen table, listening to the radio \u2013 BBC 6 Music and James O\u2019Brien on LBC \u2013 and occasionally drinking a can of Red Bull. He draws inspiration from the medieval Dutch artists Bosch and Pieter Brueghel. In the foreword to his book, the author Jon Savage also references two historical satirists. \u201cIn his sharp moral sense and his ability to create his own complex, detailed worlds, Spencer is the contemporary equivalent of [William] Hogarth or [James] Gillray, both unsparing satirists and social chroniclers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFuture social historians will find much beneath the Brexit headlines if they study these works: they will find an anatomy of contemporary England \u2013 or, to be specific, one particular part of its anatomy, the arse-end \u2013 that might help explain the delusion that has descended on the land.\u201d As Spencer spoke to the Observer, the results of the first ballot of the Tory leadership race came through on the radio. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if couldn\u2019t satirise these repellent, grotesque imbeciles. From the point of view of creating art, it\u2019s a fantastic time, there\u2019s so much material. \u201cBut thinking of my daughters growing up in this world is frightening \u2013 a small, shrinking island, bitter little England. I just hope good will prevail in the end.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
