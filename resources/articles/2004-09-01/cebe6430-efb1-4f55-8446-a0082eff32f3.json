Ever since the madrigals of the middle ages, folk wailed on about it. Not Elia Rulli though. By this Canadian singer/songwriter's reckoning, why whinge on about why so-and-so ain't lovin' you no more when you can get down to far more delicious subjects like sexual addiction (I'm Just a Boy Who Can't Say No), egomaniacs (It's All About You) and mental illness (Baby You're Weird)? Why indeed. Plenty of songsters revel in the twisted, fire-starting sides of life, baying at the dark side of the moon. But how many of those can express the random perversities of life with genuinely touching humour? Signor Rulli can. Whack on his first EP, Anarchy and Toast (even the name pops up at you) and all the spiky quips about life's hardships pour out like a warmed-up Joan Rivers. One verse he'll bemoan behaviour with no boundaries (\"Call me in the dead of night/Just to make sure your clock is right\"). Another delivers observations so simple and truthful as to make you think they've already been said before (\"It's the little things in life that kill you\"). As for his gigs, brace yourself, kids. By the end of the jazz/soul/funk set, you may find a maraca shoved in your face as the communal spirit of African music-making is recreated. A polyrhythmic orgy usually ensues. Which is good. What isn't so good is that he is yet to be signed by a major record label and, therefore, you won't know him from Adam. It won't be long though before his chocolatey voice of multiple personalities, mouth-/eye-watering chord progressions and ass-slapping bass lines adorn the iPods of all discerning disciples of decent music. In fact so disgustingly gifted is he that I'm beginning to change my mind. I think I might hate him after all. www.eliamusic.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
