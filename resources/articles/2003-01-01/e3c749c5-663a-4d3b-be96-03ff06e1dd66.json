This week, it was announced that they've called in the help of a psychology professor to help divest the party of its white male antediluvian image, and reinvent it as the friendly party with lipstick. Candidates will be vetted to ensure they display tolerance, approachability, and what Kipling once called \"the common touch\". This, it is hoped, will not only make the party more attractive to female, gay and ethnic minority candidates, but also render it more endearing to the electorate. Leaving aside the suspicion that Margaret Thatcher never got to be prime minister by being either tolerant or approachable, this all sounds like a dubious exercise in rebranding. At present, the Tories have only 14 female MPs, none from ethnic minorities, and just one who is openly gay. They are considering plans to introduce 50/50-male/female candidate-selection shortlists but won't go as far as Labour, who plan to introduce all-women selection shortlists in many areas. And even if the Tories did force constituencies to select only women, would it really help? No matter how able, intelligent or charismatic the candidate, the electorate will still be left with the indelible suspicion that those women needed the help, not because they were discriminated against, but because they were crap. And besides, Conservative selection committees are notorious for including plenty of old-style Tory women (all of them miniature Attila the Hens) who then try everything in their power to veto the selection of any new-style Tory women. In rebranding, and in appealing for more women to consider a political career, the Tories are missing the point. It may well be that they aren't getting enough female candidates because the culture of the House of Commons is still - despite reform - hostile, archaic and misogynistic, and because women will only become politicians when they can breast-feed during prime minister's questions. Or they could look for deeper answers. After all, there are plenty of other professions that are also regarded as hostile, archaic and misogynistic - law, medicine, the media - and women don't seem to lack enthusiasm for joining them. Perhaps, in that case, the problems are deeper. Perhaps it's not just the electorate who are disillusioned with politics, but prospective politicians as well. Perhaps those women who might once have thought of joining a party - any party - have caught the general ideological malaise. Perhaps they've figured out that, no matter how often the Tories or Labour announce a new cure, both parties are still suffering from the same sickness underneath. Perhaps they've worked out that politics is no longer the best place to change the world. Besides, who would join the Tories now? Roughly summarised, the advantages of being a female Tory MP are: You get to work in a place with nice wallpaper. And the disadvantages are: 1) You belong to a completely unelectable party. You have a leader with a face like a blighted potato, whose mother would have difficulty recognising him. You oppose a prime minister who could - who will - bomb Iraq, take us into a third world war, and introduce a series of social policies marginally less popular than Herod's massacre of the innocents, and still you would remain unelectable. 2) Everybody hates you. And this isn't just mild dislike, this is deep, visceral, wouldn't-piss-on-you loathing. Even now, nearly six years on, it is difficult to underestimate how many people in this country - all those north of Watford, say - comfort themselves in the low, dark hours of the night with the thought of Michael Portillo's ghastly defeated smile, and the sight of Mrs Thatcher crying. 3) Those female politicians (of either party) who do somehow retain some vestige of their own character - Clare Short, Mo Mowlam, Estelle Morris - either get sidelined or get out. 4) You have no hope of achieving anything, not even minor notoriety. 5) Tory Woman is still not a good look. Kitten heels may be a start, but most people's idea of Tory Woman's identifying characteristics are a) Mrs Thatcher's hair b) Mrs Thatcher's handbag c) Mrs Thatcher's claw finger and d) Ann Widdecombe's chest. Really, it would be much better for everyone if the Tories struck their blow for equality by banning all women from joining the party. Then, and only then, one suspects, something might actually change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
