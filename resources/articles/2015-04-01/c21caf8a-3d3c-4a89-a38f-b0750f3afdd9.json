The young Tasmanian made it ashore, but was hit in the left leg by Turkish machine gun fire and collapsed; a junior officer who ran over to him caught a neat row of bullets across the stomach and was among the first of about 620 Australian troops to die that day. Batchelor did what he could for the young officer, then dug himself in to the sand. Such was the savageness of the fighting that it was three days before a medic could get near him. \u201cThey took him to Lemnos to operate and, back in Hobart, he went on to father 10 children \u2013 the youngest of which was me,\u201d said Ben Batchelor. \u201cBut when they took those bullets out, you know, he kept them. Kept them all his life. Couldn\u2019t forget.\u201d Eceabat, a small, slightly scruffy port on the eastern side of the Gallipoli pensinula in modern day Turkey, is full of people like Ben, 79, and his wife June, 77: Australians and New Zealanders who have come to pay their respects to a brave young forebear, and to remember 11,000 fellow countrymen who came here, too, but never went back. \u201cAll those brave lads who sacrificed their lives at the behest of Britain \u2013 who honestly believed they were doing good, that they would help stop the fighting in Europe,\u201d said Ben, outside the Crowded House hotel (down the road, a bar was playing Men At Work). Cyril\u2019s brother was also in the 12th Battalion, as was Ben\u2019s mother\u2019s brother, Captain Percy Cherry; they, too, survived the eight months of ultimately pointless slaughter that was Gallipoli, but were not to be as fortunate as Cyril: both later died in France, where Percy\u2019s bravery earned him a Victoria Cross. Of the 64 VCs awarded to Australians in the first world war, nine were won at Gallipoli, five at Lone Pine on a single day: 9 August 1915. In ferocious, often hand-to-hand fighting, 2,277 of the 4,600 Australians who fought at the battle of Lone Pine were killed or wounded. Just one New Zealander was subsequently awarded the highest military honour for valour at Gallipoli: Corporal Cyril Bassett, fighting at Chunuk Bair. He was disappointed to be the only one of his countrymen to win the award when he felt \u201chundreds should have \u2026 But all my mates ever got were wooden crosses\u201d. Like the Batchelors, Queensland father and son Patrick L and Patrick J Wells, 66 and 41, are here principally for the dawn service, the emotional, almost talismanic annual ceremony at the Anzac Memorial site. The 10,500 places for the service, allocated by ballot, were oversubscribed many times over in this centennial year; at least two extra services have been organised for about 10,000Australian and New Zealand visitors who were unlucky in their applications but have made the journey anyway. Alfred James Wells, Patrick senior\u2019s great uncle, served \u2013 and survived \u2013 here in the 19th battalion. \u201cFor so many Australian families, this all means so much,\u201d said Patrick junior. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about commemorating those who lost their lives. It\u2019s that so many of the acts performed here by individuals helped forge our sense of national identity. A lot of the Australian spirit was developed here, the qualities that give you kind of a sense of what it is to be Australian.\u201d Amid the unfathomable misery of Gallipoli \u2013 the implacable, entrenched enemy; the scorching summer heat; the shortages of water and food; the thick clouds of flies feeding on tens of thousands of rotting, unburied corpses; the dysentery and the typhoid \u2013 it took a special kind of spirit merely to survive. \u201cThe men were cheerful and laughed at their plight,\u201d wrote Private Roy Denning, \u201csome jokingly saying, \u2018Oh, if only my girl could see me now\u2019. In the early hours, I heard the officers going along amongst the lads, saying, \u2018Stick to it, lads, don\u2019t go to sleep\u2019. And the cheerful reply would come, \u2018No, sir, we won\u2019t go to sleep\u2019 \u2026 and my heart swelled with admiration. I thought I was justified in being an Australian \u2026 Give me Australians as comrades and I will go anywhere duty calls.\u201d Ex-soldier Anthony Beck, 53, from Adelaide, agreed. \u201cFrom my perspective, this is where the Australian spirit started,\u201d he said. \u201cThe never-say-die, the camaraderie, the backing each other up. Mateship, compassion, loyalty, endurance. This is where we come from. It\u2019s the first place we fought as our own country.\u201d His friend Tim Dodds, 55, an Adelaide policeman, said that coming to Gallipoli was \u201chumbling, emotional, almost spiritual. To go down to that beach, to see how small it was, to look at the cliffs behind it \u2026 And yet those lads \u2013 they just got on with it\u201d. There is a \u201cstrong understanding\u201d, said Don Knight, over with his wife Cathy from Nelson, New Zealand, that \u201cthis was a badly planned, badly executed operation. But it forged the nation. We had such a large loss of life proportionately; there were only 1.2m New Zealanders in 1914, and nearly 3,000 died here\u201d. It was very important, said Alexander Best, a law student from Auckland, that his generation \u2013 he is 22 \u2013 remembered that \u201cthis is where New Zealand gained its nationhood. The first time we stood on our own as a country; first time we really showed that \u2018can-do\u2019 spirit, the \u2018She\u2019ll be right, mate\u2019 attitude \u2013 even in the face of awful tragedy\u201d. The men who fostered that spirit were men such as Stuart Avery\u2019s great great grandfather Henry Esau Avery, DSO and CMG: an All Black in 1910, he joined up in 1911 and served at Gallipoli \u2013 where he was mentioned four times in despatches \u2013 and in France and Belgium. \u201cIt\u2019s just a debt,\u201d said his great grandson, \u201cthat can never be repaid. So many young men going to serve their country and showing such courage and determination in the face of such terrible losses. It\u2019s an honour to be here, really. Humbling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
