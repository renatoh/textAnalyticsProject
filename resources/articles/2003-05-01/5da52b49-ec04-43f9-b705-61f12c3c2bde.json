Just chickens scared off by Sars, intimidated by threats of terrorism or, perhaps, stranded by transportation strikes?\" (International Herald Tribune). If anyone queries whether Sars would really affect such an event, quote the Los Angeles Times to them: \"Attendance by participants from China and Thailand has dropped 50%.\" They are staying away, you say, because they fear \"their US and European counterparts will be too scared to meet them\" (Yomiuri Shimbun). Geopolitical stresses aren't helping either, you proclaim, casting aside the Montreal Gazette: \"Talking politics at a film festival is a little like talking world peace at an arms convention... Yet beneath the high-gloss sheen... the subtext keeps bubbling up beneath the veneer.\" At the press conference for The Matrix Reloaded, for example, Keanu Reeves was \"asked if he was aware of the animosity felt between Cannes and Washington. Reeves said: 'I hope there's not'\" (Independent ). Talk of Reeves reminds you of what the Sydney Daily Telegraph said about something more important than politics: \"It is the parties for which Cannes has become famous.\" And none was more overblown than The Matrix Reloaded party, which cost an estimated \u00a32m and was the most expensive bash in the festival's history. \"It made the \u00a31m Lord of the Rings launch party two years ago seem positively penny-pinching,\" you observe, along with the Daily Mail. \"But the Matrix Reloaded notwithstanding, the American film industry, which exports a large annual quota of Hollywood glamour and aggressiveness to this quintessentially French event, is keeping a relatively low profile this year,\" you add (New York Times). There are only three US films in the main competition and if you want to win your film must have a Gallic flavour, you whisper from behind your copy of the Scotsman. \"The US showbiz bible Variety has stealthily compiled a dossier on the festival's past decade and come to the somewhat damaging conclusion that the vast majority of films selected for competition have some kind of French connection.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
