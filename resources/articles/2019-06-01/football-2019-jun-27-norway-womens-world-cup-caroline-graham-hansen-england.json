When she was younger she played in the same team as the boys and one of their parents complained that she \u201chad taken their son\u2019s place in the team\u201d. Graham Hansen was unflustered: \u201cWell, I was better than them so I deserved my place in the team.\u201d That kind of spirit \u2013 married with an outrageous set of skill, pace and stamina \u2013 has taken the 24-year-old Norwegian to the verge of worldwide fame. Graham Hansen has become Norway\u2019s focal point in the absence of Ada Hegerberg, the Lyon star who felt she did not fit in with the national team setup, and she is now looking forward to taking on England in the World Cup quarter-final on Thursday. The winger has always been a trailblazer, keen to push herself. When she was 19 she moved from Stab\u00e6k in Norway to one of the superpowers of the European game, Wolfsburg. When asked whether she wanted the family to come with her, she replied: \u201cNo, it is OK, I\u2019ll be fine on my own,\u201d but admitted sheepishly: \u201cI do hope they come and visit me and don\u2019t abandon me altogether.\u201d Before her move to Germany Graham Hansen had been part of a groundbreaking deal at Stab\u00e6k that meant that she played games for the women\u2019s team but sometimes trained with the men and the under-21 teams. She has always stood out, being a level above her teammates and that has continued on the international scene. Hard work, as with so many of the best players, is the absolute key to her success and after five years at Wolfsburg \u2013 where she won three Bundesliga titles and five cups \u2013 Graham Hansen joined Barcelona this summer. Graham Hansen estimates that she has played two or three hours of football most days since the age of five, but always for the love of the sport, not because any pressure was put on her to do so. Her parents have been a huge influence on her but in a positive, supportive way rather than in a pushy manner. She tried several sports as a youngster, including bandy, cross-country skiing and golf. \u201cMy dad likes golf a lot,\u201d she once said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have the patience for it. Every time I missed a shot I threw away the club in anger.\u201d Last season was arguably Graham Hansen\u2019s best and in this World Cup she bounced back from an injury in the final group game against South Korea to star in the last-16 game against Australia, which Norway won on penalties. Asked by Norwegian TV2 earlier in the tournament whether she was possibly in the form of her life, she said: \u201cPhysically, yes, and I think football-wise too that last season was my best considering what I did. The last three years have been an adventure and I have won whatever you can win in Germany, which is considered as one of the toughest leagues in the world. \u201cI have had a long period now, maybe a year and a half when everything has been going well and that has meant that I have been able to progress. You can train without any breaks and that is really helpful. I also hope that my form will have a knock-on effect on the rest of the squad.\u201d And that is the worrying thing for Phil Neville and his England team: Graham Hansen may be Norway\u2019s star but she is backed up by a host of players capable of causing England trouble in Le Havre. Isabell Herlovsen is a prolific forward and has 60 goals for Norway since making her debut for the national team as a 16-year-old in 2005. Two of those goals have come at the World Cup in France and she will be a threat throughout the quarter-final, especially if England are without Steph Houghton and/or Millie Bright in central defence. Then there is the tremendous Guro Reiten on the left side. The wide midfielder has the pace to worry anyone and Lucy Bronze may have to be circumspect in her forward runs. In defence Norway rely on the Chelsea pair Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdottir while the Swedish coach, Martin Sj\u00f6gren, is always keen to point out the tremendous work ethic of his side. The Norwegian media, in fact, are reporting that England have run 6km fewer per game as a team than Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s side in the tournament, something Thorisdottir was not overly surprised by. \u201cI know that the English players don\u2019t like to run that much but they are going to have to be prepared to do a few metres against us,\u201d she said with Reiten adding: \u201cWe run a lot and we fight a lot. I don\u2019t think the English players will look forward to play a game against a team running 6km more than them. We\u2019ve also had a day\u2019s extra rest.\u201d England have been warned and for Neville\u2019s team, Graham Hansen is undoubtedly the main threat. The winger, who wanted to become a fighter pilot as a youngster, is confident Norway have got what it takes to reach the semi-finals. If England can stop her from hitting the target on this occasion they will have taken a big step towards thwarting the Norwegians. One thing is for sure: it won\u2019t be easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
