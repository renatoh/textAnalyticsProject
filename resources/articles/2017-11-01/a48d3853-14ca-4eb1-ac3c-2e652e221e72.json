The England captain opened the scoring in this group one qualifier and, after Nikita Parris\u2019s header, blasted home a free-kick in the 54th minute to make the game safe. But, when Danielle Carter was fouled in the penalty area seven minutes from time, Houghton waved away team-mates\u2019 suggestions that she looked for personal gratification, insisting the regular taker, Fran Kirby, keep her job. The Chelsea forward duly converted to round off an impressive victory. Houghton said: \u201cJo Potter was saying, \u2018Go on, take it,\u2019 but I\u2019m a firm believer that the regular penalty-taker should keep it. It was important for Fran to take that one [after missing in the 6-0 v Russia]. It was nice to get my first brace. It\u2019s been a long time coming, with over 90 caps, but I\u2019m into double figures now.\u201d If Marley is not to be England\u2019s next permanent head coach she will be leaving them in fine fettle if this performance is anything to go by. The interim head coach repeated she wishes to take stock after Tuesday\u2019s third game in temporary charge, the qualifier against Kazakhstan at Colchester, but if she returns to her role with the development sides, hers will be a job well done at this rate. \u201cWe want the best person for the job,\u201d Houghton said. \u201cWhoever can help take us from third to first in the world. But the players would respect whoever gets the job.\u201d The players are clearly loving playing for Marley and this was a performance high on brio and low on inhibition; the former under-19s coach dismissed the notion this was because the players wanted her to be Mark Sampson\u2019s successor on a full-time basis. \u201cI think they\u2019re just happy to play with the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve known some of them since they were 14 and they know me more as a person, beyond this job, and that\u2019s why we agreed for me to take this role. I\u2019m not a surprise for them.\u201d England lost narrowly in a friendly to France in Marley\u2019s first game last month but after all the shenanigans over Sampson\u2019s exit and the Eni Aluko saga this was a refreshing reminder of what this squad are about. They remain second in Group One after Wales beat Kazakhstan but have a game in hand. Marley added: \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it. But it\u2019s not about me and the full-time job, it\u2019s about the team now. It\u2019s an intense turnaround with two games in such a short period. \u201cThen we always said we\u2019d take these three games and see what we think then: is it right for me but more importantly is it right for these players? What\u2019s best to take them on?\u201d The capacity 10,026 crowd at the Banks\u2019s Stadium witnessed England play as well as they have in a long time, building on their form in the 6-0 thrashing of Russia at Tranmere in September that proved to be Sampson\u2019s last game in charge. Having reached the last four of the 2015 World Cup and this summer\u2019s Euros, the challenge is for England to keep improving and Marley set her side up adventurously, with the attack-minded Jordan Nobbs anchoring a midfield awash with offensive intent. Bosnia\u2019s resistance was broken in the 19th minute when Houghton headed home a rebound after Antonela Radeljic had punched out a cross from Carter. It took only 45 seconds of the second half for Parris to nod in a great cross from Duggan and, when Carter was tripped on the edge of the box in the 54th minute, Houghton cracked in the free-kick under the wall. When Carter was fouled by Aida Hadzic, Kirby completed the rout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
