The OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment (Pisa), which quizzes 15-year-olds on reading, maths, science and a range of attitudes, found that those in the UK had the biggest declines in life satisfaction since its last survey in 2015, with barely half reporting that they were satisfied with their lives. The triennial Pisa findings come amid a largely positive set of test results for the UK, with improvements in Wales and England boosting their international rankings alongside more mixed results for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dr Angela Donkin, the chief social scientist for the National Foundation for Educational Research, which conducted the Pisa study in the UK, said: \u201cThe fact that we have seen the largest fall in life attitudes for all countries should be a wakeup call. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just down to the education sector alone to solve, but for the sector to be able to help we need to ensure that mental health provision is properly funded.\u201d The OECD tested children in 79 countries, and found that British 15-year-olds ranked 69th out of 72 countries in the world for life satisfaction, with boys in particular among the least satisfied with their lives. One cause may be that British children ranked next to last among those agreeing that \u201cmy life has a clear meaning or purpose\u201d, while the UK was alone in Europe in having more than half of its children reporting that they regularly felt sad. More than one in four British pupils reported being bullied \u201cat least a few times a month\u201d, higher than the OECD average. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the UK\u2019s performance was \u201ctarnished by the worryingly high percentages of miserable and worried pupils\u201d that Pisa has revealed. \u201cThese Pisa results will almost certainly be weaponised by the various political parties in order to defend or attack each other\u2019s policies. We\u2019d urge all parties to refrain from this and instead consider the children at the heart of these statistics and the dedicated professionals behind them,\u201d Whiteman said. On a more positive note, the OECD found the UK had a benign record in educating families of immigrants, with 20% of all students reported to have an immigrant background, compared with 9% in 2009. While one in three of immigrant children were classed as disadvantaged, the OECD found the attainment gap between immigrant and non-immigrant students was one of the smallest among industrialised countries. Overall, the academic results were dominated by the east Asian powerhouses, with mainland China\u2019s entry \u2013 comprising pupils from the regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang \u2013 outperforming by a large margin the other 78 countries in maths and science. China\u2019s rise relegated Singapore, which topped the rankings in 2015, to second place in all three subjects, although in reading alone Singapore\u2019s scores were indistinguishable from those of China. Macao followed close behind, while Estonia was Europe\u2019s standout performer, supplanting Finland as the highest-performing OECD member. In Pisa\u2019s core tests, Wales was the only UK nation to improve in each of its scores in reading, maths and science compared with the previous tests in 2015, while England had better results in reading and maths countered by a fall in science. Scotland\u2019s decline in science continued, although both it and Northern Ireland had improved scores in reading. Kirsty Williams, Wales\u2019s minister for education, said the results showing students in Wales achieving close to the OECD averages in all three subjects were \u201cpositive but not perfect\u201d. \u201cFor the first time ever, Wales is in the international mainstream, thanks to the efforts of our teachers and students. We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum,\u201d Williams said. But experts warned that the results for individual UK countries showed few differences from previous years, despite England\u2019s improvement in mathsthat helped its ranking improve from 20th to 13th, putting it alongside Germany, Finland and Ireland. John Jerrim, a UCL professor of education who studies the Pisa process, said: \u201cThe big story in England will be that scores have gone up about 10 points higher in maths and that is not seen across the rest of the UK. I would say it\u2019s far too early to call it a trend, and we can\u2019t read too much into it yet.\u201d The 2018 Pisa tests concentrated on reading, with the NFER\u2019s analysis noting that there were no significant differences between reading scores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales\u2019s reading score was \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than the rest of the UK but not significantly different from the OECD average. Pisa\u2019s survey of staff found headteachers in Scotland reporting more problems with pupil absence and teacher absenteeism than those in the rest of the UK. School leaders in Wales reported greater shortages of educational materials, and those in Northern Ireland were more likely to complain about inadequate buildings and infrastructure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
