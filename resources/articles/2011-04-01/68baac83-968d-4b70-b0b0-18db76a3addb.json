It isn't that Duckworth-Lewis are walled up behind a football-style publicity machine. In fact they're readily available and, in the flesh, almost alarmingly garrulous. It is just that they are unusually exacting. Arranging our rendezvous \u2013 to discuss their new book, Duckworth Lewis: The Method and the Men Behind It \u2013 involved a protracted, and indeed steely, wrangle over times and venues, shot through with an unyielding Duckworth-Lewis insistence on the provision of a pub lunch in semi-rural Oxfordshire. Initial resistance to this proved completely futile. Duckworth-Lewis had foreseen a pub lunch \u2013 and so it came to pass. Already, via email, I could feel the pull of their densely plotted certainties. Soon other difficulties presented themselves \u2013 physical difficulties. Duckworth-Lewis's designated pub turned out to be miles from the centre of town across open meadowland. Lewis insisted it couldn't be walked in the 30 minutes my train would allow; it would have to be the bus. I quibbled vaguely. It was only the next morning, stumbling in pig-headed D-L defiance along a never-ending Oxfordshire towpath, drenched in sweat, pursued by geese, already sliding haplessly into inexcusable lateness, that I began to sense a trap. This was, after all, Duckworth-Lewis: know-alls of the rain break, the eminent mathematicians who have been granted the last word in cricketing what-might-have-been since the institution of their system for deciding incomplete matches by the International Cricket Council in 1996. The urge to defy, just once, a pre-cast Duckworth-Lewis deduction had simply proved too much. At last, wreathed in midges and 20 minutes late, I find them installed at their weir-side table, graciously waving away my apologies. Do they get this often? Is it a hazard of being Duckworth-Lewis? Does everyone want to have a pop? \"They might do. I'm not really bothered in the slightest,\" Lewis replies, enjoying very discreetly my state of physical near-collapse. In person they are endearingly genial. Duckworth is the \"Dec\" of the partnership, shorter and more reserved; Lewis the rangy and jovial \"Ant\". They are a double act, too: solicitous of one another and given to the affectionate \"we\". As chronicled in their book, the events that set in chain D-L's rise to global renown began in 1992 with what Duckworth describes as \"the disaster\" of England's World Cup semi-final defeat of South Africa; who, having been well-placed, were left after a rain-break needing to score 22 runs off a single ball. The D-L system, honed in private by this pair of cricket-loving mathematicians, was one of several put to the ICC as a fairer solution to weather interruptions. \"Strangely, we do still get blamed for that [1992] game,\" Duckworth says wearily. \"People assume it was down to us. I even heard it on Sky Sports recently. It is irritating. But then people also blame us for the fact that it rains.\" This is the odd thing about Duckworth-Lewis. They attract irrational hostility. \"We've had a little bit of nastiness,\" Lewis says. \"There is the hate mail \u2013 'How does it feel to be the most hated person in the world, more so than Osama bin Laden?' That was after that match.\" That match is another D-L pressure point: the 2003 World Cup meeting between South Africa and Sri Lanka, which South Africa tied on Duckworth-Lewis after mistakenly believing they had reached a winning score. In the aftermath Duckworth and Lewis were portrayed being lynched in cartoon effigy in the South African press. \"It was the South Africans' misreading of their par-score sheet that ruined it,\" Duckworth says. \"The sheet had it written across the top: 'This is a par score.' I've no regrets. I've met [the then captain] Shaun Pollock since. He was fine about it.\" At this point it seems unwise to mention a pejoratively titled Facebook page about the formula that protests sport is a matter of romance and revolving opportunity rather than statistical probability. The Duckworth-Lewis method denies the comeback. It shunts the fat lady out centre stage halfway through the first intermission. Duckworth-Lewis dismiss this as \"naive comment\", pointing out that all they're doing is providing a snapshot of who is winning at any given moment to assist in incomplete matches. \"What we've done is provide a mathematical method in a non-mathematical world. One must expect that there will be cynicism.\" D-L defend their formula energetically, and with some exasperation. What about the idea it favours teams chasing? \"In matches decided by Duckworth-Lewis the team batting first won on 52% of these occasions. That reflects exactly what happens in uninterrupted matches.\" What about VJD, the alternative system now being used in the IPL, which has influential supporters in cricket's subcontinental power base? \"We have our views on other methods, but we don't like to comment,\" Duckworth says. The VJD has, he says, \"a different philosophy of maths\". Which, to have some chance of understanding, you perhaps need to have some notion of philosophies of maths existing in the first place. For now Duckworth-Lewis has the edge, both in terms of a new three-year contact with the ICC and its wider insertion in the game \u2013 and elsewhere, as witnessed by the emergence in 2009 of the Neil Hannon-fronted cricket-pop band the Duckworth-Lewis Method (\"Oh yes! Love it!\" trills Lewis). This seems like a happy note on which to leave; and to search, sheepishly, for the bus stop. You may quibble with their method, but Duckworth-Lewis are, it turns out, still invariably right.
