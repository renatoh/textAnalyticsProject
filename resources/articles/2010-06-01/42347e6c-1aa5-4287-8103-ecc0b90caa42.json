My saving of the break point in the fifth. My 50 aces. The match point. Holding up the trophy and being tired afterwards. Almost still, today. That's about it.\" There might be a more succinct description of genius, but it would have to be better than that one. That's about it: all wrapped up in one pithy recollection of an afternoon of drama that dragged the combatants into a five-set dogfight. The defending champion moves over the lawns of Wimbledon like a visiting prince come to collect his tithe. The first man to be asked to surrender to him when play begins on the Centre Court this afternoon will be the Colombian Alejandro Fella, who took only three games off the Swiss in Halle recently and lost 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 to him here six years and five titles ago. If the 65th\u2011best player in the world were to beat maybe the best player of all time, the shock might even knock the World Cup off the front of the sports pages for a day. Roddick lurks further down the line, a potential semi-final opponent, and how the American would relish a rematch. For now, Federer jostles for favouritism with Rafael Nadal of Spain, who is seeded second here and rated No1 overall in the men's game on the back of four clay-court titles on the spin, in which he has played some remarkable tennis. This is a part of the tennis cycle that brings together a roadshow that started this year so brilliantly for Federer on the hardcourts in Melbourne; delivered pain for him and joy for Nadal on the clay courts of Roland Garros in Paris; and now asks these two outstanding and contrasting talents to duke it out on the third surface, one that has been Roger's manor, more or less, since he beat Sampras in 2001. Was there room in the fight, we wondered, for Andy Murray, whom Federer devastated in the final in Melbourne? \"Yes. Regardless of what happened between here and the Australian Open, Andy is one of the big favourites for this tournament. For me, for [Novak] Djokovic and for Murray it's been, to some degree, a bit of a disappointing last few months. But I think Murray also played incredible tennis at the Australian Open. \"So, here were are again at a grand slam. You have to maybe ignore what happened in between and remember the last time you played a best-of-five-set match. This was when he was very tough. I think that's why maybe it favours the big guys. Andy's obviously one of them.\" Federer was also generous to Nadal \u2013 in his gnomic way. Had he contacted the Spaniard since Switzerland's win over Spain at the World Cup last week? \"No, I didn't get in touch with Rafa because I'm not the type of person who rubs it in,\" he said, refraining from adding \"much\". And, no, he could not be thinking about Switzerland's match against Chile, which kicks off in Port Elizabeth two hours after his own match starts today. \"You think I'll just, like, leave the court at 3pm? It's happened in the past that I've had to play matches during important things in my life. I went on court last year many times thinking Mirka was going to give birth to my children. That was a bit more crazy than Switzerland playing at 3pm.\" Neither did the proud father of twins mind losing his world No1 ranking to his chief antagonist, Nadal. \"It doesn't change a whole lot, because I don't think I can get my ranking back here anyway. It's about winning Wimbledon,\" he said. \"Mentally, I didn't go crazy after my loss at the French. It was all digested very quickly. I played well in Halle [where he lost to Lleyton Hewitt last weekend].\" For Federer, the field of dangerous enemies is restricted to a handful of players, mostly on the other side of the draw. Inclusion in this elite club does not flatter Murray; he deserves to be there \u2013 although some of the clumsy inquisition of him in the past couple of days, about whether or not the Scot would bow to the Queen in the Royal Box were he to make it to Centre Court on Thursday, reflects a mean\u2011spirited reluctance to embrace him in some quarters. It is an indictment of old-fashioned attitudes that it should even be an issue, and it is one that he has again handled with dignity and not a little irritation. Murray repeated his position on 5 Live yesterday, that he would be honoured to play in front of the Queen and would bow to her if his opponent did. Virginia Wade, who trilled and swooned before Her Majesty in her silver jubilee year triumph here, chipped in yesterday with the observation: \"I think Andy should be tickled by the Queen coming to Wimbledon.\" She went on: \"That year, I had my lucky dress with the pink details that I kept washing and wearing for every match and, when I looked up at the Royal Box, the Queen was wearing exactly the same pink, so I thought, 'That's a good sign.'\" We await news of the Queen's wardrobe for Thursday with interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
