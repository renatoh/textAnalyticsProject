The anti-malaria drug could be \u2018one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u2019, Trump claimed, but there is no magic cure. The president accuses states of asking for unneeded supplies and media of spreading fake news. Trump used his briefing to further his assertions that media outlets were spreading false information about shortages of ventilators and protective equipment. Cruise ship docks in Florida with two dead and 12 testing positive for coronavirus. The Coral Princess pulls into Miami with 1,000 passengers and 878 crew, after being refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale. Adam Schiff said Trump was \u2018decapitating\u2019 intelligence leadership amid coronavirus crisis. The chair of the House intelligence committee made the comments to MSNBC after the president fired the inspector general of the US intelligence community late on Friday night. Andrew Cuomo thanks China for ventilators as New York prepares for coronavirus peak. The New York governor announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. He also said Oregon would be lending 140 more. US has 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. President Trump has approved Arizona governor Doug Ducey\u2019s request for a major disaster declaration. \u201cThis continued collaboration will be crucial as we utilize all tools to combat this virus,\u201d Ducey said. A release from Ducey\u2019s office said the declaration will ensure federal resources will be supplied to Arizona to help provide access to mental health care, unemployment assistance, legal services, hazard mitigation, nutritional aid and crisis counseling. As of Saturday morning, Arizona had reported 2,019 coronavirus cases and 52 deaths. Here\u2019s our colleague Oliver Milman\u2019s story on Trump\u2019s bold hydroxychloroquine claim during today\u2019s briefing: Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak. The US president last week used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d He followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. Trump was immediately contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis and indeed his entire presidency, responded by telling reporters that \u201cI\u2019m a smart guy\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot.\u201d The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity seem to be satisfied by this assurance and have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows. But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic. With New Orleans having emerged as one of the national hotspots in the coronavirus outbreak, Louisiana state medical officials are preparing for Monday\u2019s re-opening of the Ernest N Morial Convention Center as a makeshift, 1,000-bed medical support facility to ease the strain on local hospitals. Dr Joseph Kanter, the assistant state health officer, said the field hospital could double its capacity to 2,000 beds by the end of the month if necessary, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t even halfway over \u2013 it is not time to let up. Standing in a convention hall housing a football field\u2019s worth of white tents, nurses\u2019 stations and portable handwashing basins, Kanter cast a quick glance around and said, \u201cHow great would it be if we didn\u2019t need half this?\u201d The number of state residents stricken with Covid-19 jumped Saturday to 12,946, an increase of about 2,200 from the previous day. The New Orleans area continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in Louisiana, with 3,966 known cases and 154 deaths reported out of Orleans Parish. Neighboring Jefferson Parish has another 3,008 known cases, 95 of them fatal. To what extent Saturday\u2019s hike resulted from an increased testing rate is unclear. A total of 4,853 new test results came in. That was higher than the average the state was registering earlier in the week, but exactly how many of those were older results wasn\u2019t clear. The number of new deaths reported Saturday was lower than on Friday \u2013 39 as opposed to 60 \u2013 but higher than Thursday\u2019s toll of 37. On the contrary, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and on life-saving ventilator machines was higher than Friday: 1,726 and 571, respectively. Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile. Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in. The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager. Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds. In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States. \u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war, a world war one or two or something. But this is a war, all into itself, and it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d Trump continues to lobby for hydroxychloroquine as a preventative for coronavirus. \u201cI just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins, coupled with perhaps the Z-Pak as we call it, depending totally on your doctors and the doctors there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a possibility \u2013 a possibility \u2013 and I say it: what do you have to lose? I\u2019ll say it again: what do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it\u2019s their choice and it\u2019s their doctor\u2019s choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you like.\u201d Birx says the counties in and around New York, Detroit and New Orleans are on the upsides of their curves and will all hit together in the next seven days. \u201cThey\u2019re all on the upside of their curve of mortality, so you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side,\u201d Birx says. \u201cBy the predictions that are in that healthdata.org, they\u2019re predicting those three hotspots all of them hitting together in the next six to seven days.\u201d Trump steps in as Fauci is underscoring the efficacy of social distancing, circling back on his central theme of the day: the need to reopen the country as soon as possible. \u201cMitigation does work but again, we\u2019re not going to destroy our country,\u201d the president says. \u201cAt a certain point you\u2019ll lose more people this way through all of the problems caused. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. OK?\u201d Trump says he considered moving to relax stay-at-home orders nationwide so parishioners could celebrate Easter Sunday next week. \u201cPalm Sunday, tomorrow,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThink of it. We\u2019re not going to churches on Palm Sunday. But think of next Sunday: Easter. And I brought it up before, I said, maybe we could allow a special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s something we should talk about. But somebody did say, \u2018Well, then you\u2019re sort of opening it up to ... do we want to take a chance on doing that when we\u2019ve been doing so well?\u2019 \u201cBut Easter Sunday! Palm Sunday, I\u2019m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California \u2013 great church \u2013 but I\u2019m going to be watching on a computer. On a laptop. I think on Easter maybe I\u2019ll be watching on a laptop. How sad is it that we have Easter, Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It\u2019s sad. But the job that this whole country has done is amazing.\u201d Trump, who says he\u2019s tested negative for Covid-19 on two occasions, says he may start to take hydroxychloroquine, adding that it may be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for treating the virus. \u201cIf it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway,\u201d Trump said about the drug, which has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cI may take it. OK? I may take it. And I\u2019ll have to ask my doctors about that but I may take it.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some very preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells, but experts have warned of its major potential side effects, especially for the heart. Trump points out yesterday\u2019s news that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s campaign supports the president\u2019s decision to ban foreign nationals who had been in China within the previous 14 days from entering the United States. \u201cBreaking news last night, you know that you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early from coming into our country,\u201d Trump says. Shortly after, a reporter asks the president to comment on Biden\u2019s tweet from roughly an hour ago, where the former vice-president said Trump \u201cis not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it\u201d. Says Trump: \u201cHe didn\u2019t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn\u2019t write. He\u2019s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s watching.\u201d He adds: \u201cThey released [the tweet] at a strange time. Sort of strange time to release something like that, but he admitted I was right.\u201d \u201cI thought he did a terrible job,\u201d Trump says of Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community who was fired on Friday night. He says Atkinson was a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and should have looked at the transcript of his \u201cperfect call\u201d with the Ukrainian president before taking any action. Trump says he called the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, today: \u201cI said I\u2019d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug the president believes could be helpful as a therapeutic. Dr Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, follows Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, saying \u201cwe are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials and use if doctors think it\u2019s appropriate\u201d. Trump says his administration is using the Defense Production Act \u201cvery powerfully\u201d, saying Fema and HHS have ordered 180m N95 masks. \u201cWe need the masks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other people getting them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re instuting a lot of Defense Production Act. You could call it retaliations because that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s a retaliation. If people don\u2019t give us what we need for our people, we\u2019re going to be very tough.\u201d The president says 1,000 military personnel will deploy to New York City, which has continued to surge as a \u201chotspot\u201d for Covid-19 cases. Trump adds: \u201cWe will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we\u2019ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure and get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don\u2019t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We have to open our country again. This country wasn\u2019t meant for this. Few were, few were. But we have to open our country again.\u201d Trump then lists the sports commissioners that he spoke with earlier today, adding Nascar president Steve Phelps, who was omitted from the handout provided by a White House spokesperson earlier in the day. \u201cThese are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe sports weren\u2019t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn\u2019t designed for it.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing, alongside vice president Mike Pence, virus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx and infection disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci, by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d He continues: \u201cThis will be probably the toughest week, between this week and next week, and there will be a lot of death, unfortunately. But a lot less death than if this wasn\u2019t done, but there will be death. We\u2019re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest-hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some are not so obvious. They spring up, they hit you like you got hit by a club. An area that wasn\u2019t at all bothered \u2013 you look at what\u2019s going on in New Jersey, the governor is doing an excellent job by the way \u2013 but how that sprang up. Every decision we\u2019re making is made to save lives. It\u2019s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. The president then immediately pivots toward the media: \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible. I could name them but it\u2019s the same ones. Always the same ones. I guess they looking for ratings. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for. So bad for our country. The people understand it. Look at the levels and approval ratings, they\u2019re the lowest they\u2019ve ever been for media. So bad for our country, so bad for the world. Put it together for a little while. Get this over with and then go back to your fake news.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d Although President Trump has resisted instituting a national shelter-in-place recommendation to combat coronavirus \u2013 in contrast with top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s advice \u2013 87% of US residents said they\u2019re trying to stay home when possible, according to a new survey. A mere 7% of US residents said they are not making such an effort, while 6% reported being \u201cunsure\u201d. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll also indicated overwhelming support of stay-at-home mandates, with 79% of US residents saying their states were right in issuing such orders. The survey also found that approximately 61% of US residents would keep staying home this month when possible even if their states started lifting restrictions. About 19% said they would return to living \u201cas normally as possible if restrictions were lifted\u201d, per the research. The New York Post appears to have first outlet other than Huffington Post reporting on this study, which was based on 1,000 completed interviews conducted from 27 to 31 March. \u201cThose findings shouldn\u2019t be taken as absolute or immovable. People aren\u2019t necessarily great at predicting their own actions in a future hypothetical situation. That\u2019s especially true now, with the outbreak continuing to rapidly unfold and statements from the White House varying greatly in tone and content,\u201d the study noted. \u201cThe results, however, do suggest the majority of the public is hunkering down not merely out of duress, but also out of their own genuine concerns \u2013 and that they\u2019re prepared to continue doing so for at least some time.\u201d Just about 25% of US residents said they thought things would soon return to normal, as 62% expected \u201clasting effects on the nation\u201d. \u201cThe rest are unsure what will happen.\u201d The survey, released Thursday, comes as several states have remained slow to enact efforts in the fight against Covid-19. Alabama\u2019s stay-at-home order is only just going into effect Saturday at 5pm,. Arkansas has not implemented this kind of mandate. Iowa, Nebraska, as well as North and South Dakota also have not, per reports. The White House announces the president has issued disaster declarations for the states of Wisconsin and Nebraska, bringing the overall count to 36 states, the District of Columbia and four US territories. The declarations are issued as Trump is set to speak at the White House coronavirus task force press briefing, which is due to begin shortly. ESPN reports that Donald Trump hopes to have fans back in stadiums and arenas by August and wants the NFL, America\u2019s most popular sports league, to start as scheduled in September. The president held a conference call with commissioners and leaders from a variety of US sports leagues on Saturday. Professional sports have shut down in the last few weeks as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken hold across America. The NBA was the first league to shut on 11 March, and it was soon followed by MLS and NHL. The start of the baseball season has also been postponed. Health officials have not made it clear whether they find Trump\u2019s timetable realistic, but this summer\u2019s Olympics, which had been due to take place in late July and end in early August have been postponed until 2021. The NFL has previously said it expects to start as scheduled in September in front of fans. California governor Gavin Newsom was asked about Trump\u2019s reported target for NFL season during his daily press briefing in Sacramento, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that happening in this state.\u201d \u201cOur decision on that basis at least here in the state of California will be determined by the facts, will be determined by the health experts, will be determined by our capacity to meet this moment, bend the curve and have the appropriate community surveillance and testing to competently determine whether or not that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focused on the immediate, but that\u2019s not something I anticipate happening in the next few months.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s coronavirus test backlog has been reduced to 13,000 tests pending, down from 60,000 on Friday, during his daily briefing from Sacramento. A total of 126,700 Californians have been tested for the virus, according to the governor. Newsom pointed to the recent peak of 59,500 individuals with results pending in California, admitting: \u201cThe testing space has been a challenging one for us and I own that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve substantially reduced that backlog,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the commercial labs stepping up.\u201d The governor also shared California\u2019s updated Covid-19 figures as of Saturday: 2,300 hospitalizations with 1,008 ICU patients (a 10.9% increase over Friday) and 12,026 known cases (a 12.4% increase). He also announced a newly launched website \u2013 covid19supplies.ca.gov \u2013 where citizens can donate or sell personal protective equipment like N95 masks to the state. He said the state has distributed more than 41m N95 masks in addition to other protective gear. \u201cWe are purchasing supplies at scale,\u201d he said. \u201cForty-one million N95 masks we\u2019ve already delivered. We are committed to hundreds of millions more. And that requires diligence, that requires a level of expertise and we can never let speed become the enemy of real results that ultimately deliver on our promise.\u201d Reuters has cited two sources that allege Donald Trump pressed federal officials to make anti-malarial drugs available to treat Covid-19, despite the fact that they were untested on the virus. Reuters reports that the government then took the unusual step of telling doctors they had the option of prescribing the drugs, despite the fact that dosages had not been peer reviewed. \u201cThe president is short-circuiting the process with his gut feelings,\u201d Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School, told Reuters. \u201cWe are in an emergency and we need to rely on our government to ensure that all these potential therapies are tested in the most effective and objective way.\u201d The White House told Reuters that Trump had not launched a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d over the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. \u201cThe President\u2019s top priority is the health and safety of the American people which is why he has brought together the federal government and private sector, including doctors, scientists, and medical researchers, for an unprecedented collaboration to expedite vaccine development,\u201d said the statement. Joe Rogan, host of the hugely popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, has said he would vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in the presidential election. Rogan gave his views during Friday\u2019s edition of his podcast, which regularly tops the iTunes chart for downloads. During a conversation with his guest Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, talk turned to the upcoming presidential elections. Weinstein said he would not vote for either Trump or Biden, the probable Democratic candidate in November\u2019s election. Rogan said that the Democrats had made \u201cmorons\u201d out of voters by appearing to favour Biden as their candidate. \u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Trump than [Biden],\u201d said Rogan. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can handle anything. You\u2019re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can\u2019t do that. And we don\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019ll be like after a year in office. \u201cThe pressure of being President of the United States is something that no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough. He doesn\u2019t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.\u201d Biden turns 78 in November and Rogan described him as \u201cvery old\u201d and said the senator\u2019s famous verbal slip-ups were \u201cnot a normal way to communicate unless he\u2019s high.\u201d Rogan has previously endorsed Biden\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, who is a year older than Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life,\u201d said Rogan. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d The president of the Human Rights Campaign said in January that Sanders should reconsider accepting Rogan\u2019s endorsement due to the fact that the podcaster has \u201cattacked transgender people, gay men, women, people of colour and countless marginalised groups at every opportunity\u201d. A few more details on our earlier post on jails in New York. The city\u2019s jails department said that as of Saturday morning, 305 staff members and 251 incarcerated persons have tested positive for the virus. With regard to the new parole lawsuit, which opposes the automatic jailing of people accused of violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed, the state prisons department, says it\u2019s reviewing the suit and can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. The department said that in response to the circumstances, it is changing longtime policies, and making new ones, to protect those in the prison system, while maintaining public safety. Donald Trump spoke with commissioners and leaders from major US sports leagues and tournaments today. Sports in the US \u2013 and around the world \u2013 have been halted during the pandemic with major consequences for the finances of teams and athletes. Among those present on the conference call with the president were commissioners from the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA and MLS. UFC president Dana White, a long-time ally of Trump was also on the call as was Vince McMahon of WWE. \u201cToday, President Donald J Trump spoke by telephone with commissioners of major league sports to discuss the all-of-America response to Covid-19. The President recognized the good work being done by many teams and players to care for their communities, workforces, and fan bases across the Nation,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \u201cThe commissioners thanked President Trump for his national leadership and for his interest in the sports industry. President Trump encouraged them to continue to support their fellow Americans during this challenging time.\u201d Trump has clashed with several figures from the world of sports during his presidency. He described NFL players who knelt in protest at police brutality as \u201csons of bitches\u201d, while the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors declined to attend the White House for the traditional visit after winning two championships. As coronavirus continues to tear through US jails and prisons, New York civil rights advocates filed a lawsuit Friday opposing the automatic jailing of people accused of parole violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed. Lawyers are demanding an opportunity for the release of more than 1,000 people held in New York City jails \u201cin light of the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus and the dangerous public health conditions in these facilities.\u201d This Manhattan federal court civil complaint names governor Andrew Cuomo and the state\u2019s top parole official as defendants. New York Civil Liberties Union and The Legal Aid Society explain that the state\u2019s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision must hold a hearing within 90 days to determine an alleged parole violation \u2013 and whether parole should subsequently be revoked. Some of these \u201ctechnical\u201d violations might be something as minor as neglecting to report a new address, change in employment, or missing a parole officer appointment. Several other lawsuits have been filed this week demanding the release of detained parolees from city jails due to Covid-19. For approximately 20% of parole \u201cre-arrests\u201d, these revocation hearings happen after the 90-day period, \u201cand during the coronavirus pandemic these hearings have been suspended almost completely\u201d. \u201cBefore that hearing, there is no opportunity to determine if the person even needs to be in jail simply to wait for that hearing,\u201d advocates say. Because of this dramatic slowdown, people are languishing in jail \u201cindefinitely\u201d \u2013 all the while facing heightened danger from Covid-19. The lawsuit claims that as of Friday, 239 inmates in New York City\u2019s infamous Rikers Island jail have coronavirus. In excess of 2,000 people are now in quarantine units for potential exposure \u2013 approximately 50% of Rikers\u2019 population, advocates say. \u201cAt current rates of infection, the virus\u2019s \u2018attack rate\u2019 in New York jails \u2013 that is, the rate at which the population is being infected \u2013 is 64 times higher than the average in the United States of America and seven times higher than New York City,\u201d the lawsuit maintains. While Cuomo did recently announce that he intends to release up to 600 persons held on technical parole violations due to coronavirus, slightly over 100 have been released as of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, lawyers note. Neither the governor nor state corrections department immediately responded to a request for comment on the federal action. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said the number of Covid-19 cases statewide rose to 34,124 on Saturday at his daily coronavirus briefing in the state capital of Trenton. A total of 846 have died, eclipsing the number of New Jersey lives lost in the 9/11 terror attacks. \u201cWe are today reporting that another 200 residents of passed due to Covid-19 related complications,\u201d he says. \u201cOur state total now sits at 846 precious lives lost. Let me put this in a proper, yet very sobering context. We have now lost nearly 100 more of our fellow New Jerseyans to Covid-19 that we did on the September 11th attacks. Please let that sink in for a moment. This pandemic is writing one of the greatest tragedies in our state\u2019s history and just as we have committed to never forget the lives lost on 9/11, we must commit to never forgetting those we are losing to this pandemic.\u201d He adds: \u201cLet\u2019s just all remember again: this is war. We are in a war. How do you win wars? You don\u2019t panic and you don\u2019t go business-as-usual. You win it by being smart, aggressive, proactive, shooting straight with each other, being honest about the toll that is both before us and will continue to grow. Let\u2019s not kid each other. You win wars by not turning on each other, but to the contrary, coming together. This extraordinary diverse state coming together as one family. \u201cYou win a war because your work harder than the next folks. You win it because you show courage as we\u2019re seeing every single day up and down this state, from our frontline healthcare workers, to every single one of the nine million of us, including folks right now at home by themselves doing exactly what we need. Every single one of us is a hero right now. Every single one of us must do our part if we are to flatten the curve of this virus, allow our healthcare system to be able to deal with it properly and then emerge on the other side. And unequivocally may I say, if we all do our part, there is no question in my mind we will win this war and we will emerge from it stronger as one New Jersey family, more together than ever before.\u201d Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, said Donald Trump is \u201cdecapitating the leadership of the intelligence community in the middle of a national crisis\u201d and \u201csettling scores\u201d after the president fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community, late on Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on MSNBC on Saturday. \u201cAnd of course it sends a message throughout the federal government and in particular to other inspectors general that if they do their job as this professional did and Michael Atkinson was a complete professional, they too may be fired by a vindictive president.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff\u2019s alarm, calling the firing of the Trump appointee \u201ca brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty\u201d. Here\u2019s a bit more on New York\u2019s ventilator hunt from our health reporter: Chinese billionaires and the state of Oregon facilitated ventilator donations to New York to treat patients with Covid-19, as the pandemic accelerates toward a peak. New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, while President Trump again promoted an unproven malaria drug as treatment for Covid-19 on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described that crescendo of cases as, \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy.\u201d In addition to the 1,000 ventilators obtained from China, Cuomo said Oregon loaned New York 140 ventilators. Current projections put the peak of the pandemic anywhere between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing imposed across the state will slow the spread of the disease, and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and beds, even as Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon so the experience would end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime,\u201d Cuomo said. The briefing was another contrast in leadership between Cuomo and Trump. Where Cuomo\u2019s briefings have alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised across the country. On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, which he was later told could not be filled because many had already been purchased by China. Justin Trudeau, speaking at his daily Covid-19 briefing, says Canada won\u2019t bring retaliatory measures against the United States after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks. The Associated Press reports: Trudeau says he will speak to President Trump in the coming days. He says his officials are having constructive conversations with American officials. Trudeau says he will tell Trump both countries are interlinked in ways that it would damage both if supply chains are cut. The prime minister says Canada ships gloves and testing kits to the U.S and notes materials from the N95 masks originate in Canada. Canadian nurses also cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system everyday. Manufacturing giant 3M says there are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing N95 masks to health care workers in Canada and Latin America, where 3M is a critical supplier of respirators. Cuomo has finished his daily briefing from Albany, where he warned the hardest days lie ahead for the state that\u2019s become the central hotbed of the pandemic in the United States. \u201cIf there was anything I could do to accelerate getting it over, I would,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways I want to get to that apex. I want to get on the other side of that apex and let\u2019s just slide down that mountain. On the other hand we have to be ready for the fight and we have to handle that fight. And that\u2019s where we are. \u201cSo what do we do? You have to get to through it. There is no simple answer here. You\u2019re not going to wish this away. You have to get through it and you have to get through it intelligently, saving as many lives as you can. And that\u2019s hard work and that\u2019s perseverance and that\u2019s mutuality and that\u2019s community and that\u2019s finding your better self and that\u2019s finding your inner strength and dealing with a situation that is almost unmanageable on every level, because you are out of control. \u201cAnd this is a painful, disorienting experience. \u201cBut we find our best self, our strongest self [and] this day will end and we will get through it and we will get to the other side of the mountain and we will be the better for it. But we have to do what we have to do between now and then and that\u2019s just what we doing here.\u201d Cuomo says the number of hospitalizations on Long Island has grown exponentially in the last few days, saying he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because city residents are fleeing or seeking treatment there. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for the past few days, watch Long Island, because it\u2019s like a fire, spreading,\u201d he says. Cases in Long Island\u2019s Nassau County are at 13,346 (up 1,322 from yesterday), the second-highest in the state. Suffolk County cases are at 11,370 (up 1,216 from yesterday). While Andrew Cuomo is speaking in New York, Trump has continued to be busy on Twitter, mostly retweeting but adding comments of his own. To wit: The president\u2019s belief in the possibility that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, might be an effective treatment for Covid-19 is not shared with his leading public health experts on the White House task force. On Fox News on Friday, infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said: \u201cWe still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective. But when you don\u2019t have that information, it\u2019s understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective.\u201d All this, of course, does not stop Trump returning to the well on Twitter and at White House briefings. Here\u2019s Oliver Milman\u2019s look at the issue: The president carries on: It often pays to check who Trump is retweeting. John Solomon, it should be noted, is a columnist whose work for The Hill was used in attempts to smear opponents of the president during the Ukraine affair which led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump has obviously been scrolling down Solomon\u2019s profile page this morning: Late on Friday night, Trump made his latest move against a leader of the intelligence community, in this case one who played a key role in the impeachment process: Cuomo says that the Chinese government will facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators to arrive into JFK airport today, saying: \u201cThis is a big deal and it\u2019s going to make a significant difference for us.\u201d He\u2019s pressed on the impending reality that New York will not have enough ventilators for admissions, which will require two patients on the same ventilator. \u201cSplitting is not ideal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to war with what you have, not with what you need.\u201d The state of Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to New York, Cuomo says, calling it \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d. \u201cI want this all to be over,\u201d the governor says. \u201cIt\u2019s only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime. I think we all feel the same. This stresses this country, this state in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime. It stresses us on every love. The economy is stressed, the social fabric is stressed, social systems are stressed, transportation is stressed. It\u2019s right across the board. But the most difficult level is the human level. It is for me, anyway. And it\u2019s every day and it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou can\u2019t even quantify the effect on society and the effect on individuals and the burden that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo opens Saturday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing with the latest numbers: Covid-19 cases in New York City: 63,606 (up 6,147 from Friday) Covid-19 cases in New York state: 113,704 (up 10,841 from Friday) Total people tested (283,621) Total people hospitalized: 15,905 (up 1,095 from yesterday) Total ICU admissions: 4,126 (up 395 from yesterday) A woman is Florida is seeking to gain sole custody of her two-year-old son during the Covid-19 pandemic because the boy\u2019s father works in the emergency services. According to court papers, Tabatha Sams currently shares custody with her son\u2019s father, Stephen Thilmony, who is a firefighter and emergency medicine technician. Thilmony\u2019s fiancee, meanwhile, is an emergency room nurse. \u201cAs Covid-19 has spread throughout the United States, medical professionals and first responders have been subjected to coronavirus at a higher rate, due to their increased exposure to individuals testing positive for the virus,\u201d Sams said in the court papers. In the papers, Thilmony is quoted as saying he is not endangering his son. \u201cWe are taking proper measures to protect ourselves and him,\u201d Thilmony said. The Daily Show has put together clips of politicians and media figures giving their views on Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. Let\u2019s just say some of the quotes have not aged well: There has been plenty of concern about the potential for mass casualties in US jails during the Covid-19 pandemic. A public health expert has also warned outbreaks that start in jails could pose risks for the wider community. \u201cThe prison population in and of itself has a fairly sizable, vulnerable population within that, have a lot of chronic conditions, other types of infections,\u201d Dr Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, told CNN. \u201cWe should also ensure that what happens in a prison, or a jail for that matter, does not pose an undue risk to the community. In this case, we know we have ample examples from many infectious diseases.\u201d As fatalities rise in the United States, the shortage of space to store bodies is becoming a concern. It\u2019s a problem that authorities had to confront in countries hit by the Covid-19 epidemic earlier than the US: for example, in Spain a Madrid ice rink was used to store bodies before burial. Med Alliance Group, a medical distributor in Illinois, has reported being inundated with requests for refrigerated trailers. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from all over: From hospitals, health systems, coroner\u2019s offices, VA facilities, county and state health departments, state emergency departments and funeral homes,\u201d Christie Penzol, a spokeswoman for Med Alliance, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Penzol added that the company has already rented out all its trailers and there is an 18-week wait for the materials needed to build new ones. Fox News host Sean Hannity hit back against intense criticism of the conservative network\u2019s coronavirus coverage, even claiming in a new interview that he was ahead of most media in taking Covid-19 seriously. Hannity\u2019s statements to Newsweek were in response to a 1 April open letter signed by 74 journalism professors that lambasted Fox News for allegedly spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the outbreak. The professors\u2019 missive directly cited Hannity\u2019s statement that the Democrats and media overplayed coronavirus to \u201cbludgeon Trump with this new hoax.\u201d Their letter came several days before a report in The Daily Beast that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan were bracing for lawsuits over Fox News\u2019s coronavirus coverage. Asked about his statement that Democrats and the media were using Covid-19 \u201cto bludgeon Trump,\u201d Hannity responded, \u201cMany of them did.\u201d \u201cWe are in the middle of the huge pandemic and where\u2019s the Democrat saying, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t agree with the travel ban at the time, but it was the right decision.\u2019 Politics trumps truth in their world.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same Democrats, media mob and liberal professors who are so lazy they won\u2019t even look at what I\u2019ve said about the virus. They just go with their narrative. I never called it a \u2018hoax,\u2019\u201d Hannity said when subsequently asked about his \u201choax\u201d comment. \u201cI said it was a hoax for them to be using it as a bludgeon on Trump. And they are. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are talking about an investigation. Now? In the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Hannity also said \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d The letter, addressed to both Murdoch and his son, claimed \u201cviewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network \u2013 false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms\u2026\u201d The professors further claimed that Fox News offered \u201cmisleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.\u201d Mediaite pointed out that while Fox News has taken some actions that seemingly view coronavirus more seriously \u2013 with Hannity and other talking heads such as Tucker Carlson appearing in a PSA, for example \u2013 there have still been questionable moments. On Friday night, Carlson criticized infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s call for a national stay-at-home mandate. \u201cMore than 10 million Americans have already lost their jobs. Imagine another year of this. That would be national suicide, and yet, that is what Anthony Fauci is suggesting, at least,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not suggesting that Fauci wants to hurt America. We don\u2019t think he does, he seems like a very decent man. But Fauci is not an economist or for that matter someone who fears being unemployed himself. Like most of the people around him.\u201d Probable Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has issued a statement calling for Donald Trump to appoint a \u201csupply commander\u201d to \u201cco-ordinate critical materials for all 50 states and US territories\u201d. Biden has been seeking a call with Trump to discuss the coronavirus response. No word that it\u2019s happened yet. Marc Caputo of Politico, meanwhile, makes a wry point: MSNBC host Rachel Maddow called for essentially the same thing last night. Here\u2019s some further reading: Washington bureau chief David Smith again \u2013 busy lad \u2013 with a look at where the 2020 election stands with the nation in the grip of Covid-19: Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with daily coronavirus taskforce briefings from the White House. Polls suggest he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d Still no sign of the president, whose thumbs would often have twitched towards his iPhone by this time of a Saturday. Over at the Washington Post, meanwhile, media columnist Margaret Sullivan has an interesting take this morning on Andrew and Chris Cuomo\u2019s developing coronavirus double act, in which the New York governor and his CNN anchor (and Covid-19 patient) brother regularly conduct interviews full of endearing brotherly bickering. \u201cNot everyone approves of the Cuomo Brothers show,\u201d Sullivan writes. This is something I cannot wrap my head around,\u201d Fabian Reinbold, Washington bureau chief for a large German news organization, told me in an email this week. \u201cIt would be considered highly inappropriate and corrupt back home.\u201d He was particularly taken aback by Chris Cuomo\u2019s choice to actually participate in Thursday\u2019s [New York governor\u2019s] news conference, piped in via videoconference to hold forth to the gathered press corps. He wore a baseball cap emblazoned with the name of his CNN show, \u201cCuomo Primetime,\u201d further blurring the roles of brother and anchor. That moment may have proved too much for competitors Fox News and MSNBC, who cut away from the New York governor\u2019s briefing soon after. Others have questioned the journalistic propriety of repeatedly interviewing one\u2019s brother on prime-time TV, as Chris Cuomo has been doing for weeks. Jon Allsop at Columbia Journalism Review, for one, disapproves. He reasonably suggests a less fraught approach: \u201cThere are plenty of ways Chris Cuomo could communicate about his health with CNN viewers while also taking time to recuperate. While he\u2019s out, a colleague could talk with his brother.\u201d All that said, Sullivan also points out that in a nation grown used to the open nepotism of the Trump administration, where the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law double as his chief advisers, perhaps the Cuomo Show is relatively small beer. It also seems necessary to say, again, that it really is quite endearing: Good morning and welcome to another day of US coronavirus coverage. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. We\u2019ll expect to hear from New York governor Andrew Cuomo, about conditions in the state worst hit by far. Those Johns Hopkins figures put confirmed cases in New York at around 103,000 and deaths at nearly 3,000. Here\u2019s Daniel Strauss\u2019s look at how Cuomo has navigated the crisis, relations with Donald Trump and a national spotlight which has also landed on his younger brother Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor who was this week found to have contracted Covid-19. There is also a White House briefing due at the earlier-than-usual time of 3.30pm ET, which is 8.30pm UK. On Friday, Donald Trump made his usual round of headlines at the briefing room podium, not least by announcing new federal guidelines that say people should wear face masks in public, which his wife Melania tweeted out as he spoke, but then saying he was not going to do so. The president also attacked reporters, criticised Cuomo over his appeals for ventilators to fight an expected surge in New York cases, and defended his son-in-law Jared Kushner for comments about the federal healthcare equipment stockpile at the briefing the day before. Ed Pilkington, our chief reporter, has another in-depth read about Trump\u2019s struggle to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s here: There\u2019s been no word from Trump on Twitter yet this morning but there\u2019s always time for that to change. For some further reading as this Saturday begins, here\u2019s a key quote from Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s fascinating interview with Jon Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent and a long-term Trump foil whose new book, obviously written before the pandemic, is called Front Row at the Trump Show: We\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d More, as they say, follows.
