Ipswich had just survived a close-range diving header from Dougie Freedman, well saved by the impressive Shane Supple, and the 18-year-old goalkeeper caught Palace's final cross into his box before Royle trooped off with his 10 remaining players, pleased at the respite and the point. Ten minutes later he reappeared and admitted that Ipswich had come for a win and bemoaned the fact that Ricardo Fuller's sending-off had hindered their attempts. \"This week I've written to the head of referees, the LMA and the PFA complaining about the standards of refereeing in this division,\" he said. \"We're not a dirty side and we've had six sendings-off this season for absolutely naff all. \"I feel for Ricardo Fuller. I don't condone it but he's been kicked and pulled and he wasn't given a foul all afternoon. In frustration he's put two fingers up to their crowd. If that's a sending-off offence, my God. It was never going to be easy this year but had we not had these sendings-off we could easily be 10 points better off.\" That they left south London with a deserved one, and still trail fifth-placed Palace by 12 points, was due to Fuller's second goal in three loan games, but soon after scoring the Jamaican - who played eight blank games for Palace in 2001 - was shown a yellow card for time-wasting. Eleven minutes after celebrating the equaliser he was issued with a straight red for making an offensive gesture to a linesman, who advised the referee of the misdemeanour while the striker guiltily tied his laces in the centre-circle and tried to look inconspicuous. Fuller will now miss the final game of his month's loan, at home to Hull on Saturday, though Royle is keen to extend the stay having already used 20 sets of strikers this term. But the manager pointed out that to sign the Southampton striker remains a question of finance, with the unloved relic of the disastrous Harry Redknapp year still being paid Premiership wages at St Mary's. Palace had looked the bolder team throughout and soon took the lead through Aki Riihilahti's header although Ipswich equalised when Darren Ward's desperate clearance hit Tom Soares and crept over the line. After the restart Clinton Morrison lost his marker and headed in a Ben Watson free-kick and that would normally have secured them the three points but their defence looked less than assured and Ipswich capitalised. \"If we get three points at Leeds on Tuesday that will make this a decent result,\" Riihilahti said. \"If we don't then this is very bad. \"There are eight games to go and if we make a really good run we still have a chance for automatic promotion. The minimum requirement is the play-offs but if we look at other clubs' results, that would be wrong. We'll play our own game. We're confident we're going to get promotion no matter how it comes.\" Man of the match Luis Castro Sito (Ipswich Town)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
