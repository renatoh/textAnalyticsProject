Crisply spoken (now there's a change) and tightly bound together by Tom Piper's dark wooden drum of a design, the action swoops clearly through multitudes of shadows. This is the fourth production I've seen in the past 12 months, and the only one that can't easily be characterised by an adjective. Calixto Bieto's version was cut-to-pieces; Jonathan Kent's was Japanese; Trevor Nunn's was youthful. Boyd's, his first production since he became the RSC's artistic director, is - well, it would once have been called traditional, but it's no longer customary to see an Elizabethan-dress Hamlet or one in which the revenge motive is so plain. The enemies here are outside the prince rather than within. Which makes it both bracing and partial. Meg Fraser is a skilful Ophelia. For most of the play, she's still, almost marmoreal; when she goes mad, she becomes what seems would be most shocking in this court - muscular, assertive, almost male. Richard Cordery makes a very funny Polonius: a big, vain, imperious baby. And Greg Hicks brilliantly reshapes the Ghost as a chalk-white, half-naked goblin, bent double, with orange sockets for eyes. He hauls himself on to the stage like a giant caterpillar half-emerging from its chrysalis; he spews up his words as if they were painful; he throws himself into Hell like an infernal surfer. A neat bit of casting has him emerging later from the underworld as the grave-digger. And so things speed along. But there's a difficulty at the centre. As Hamlet, Toby Stephens wages a constant battle between precision and floridity. He can pick a line apart with darting accuracy; he's bold, too, not trapped in reverence or in a determination to be irreverent. He's a scornful, soldierly prince, whose duelling must be among the most thrilling ever. And he's among the most actorish of Hamlets. It's uncanny to see, in this father-haunted, mother-obsessed play, how his own father, Robert Stephens, is recalled in his tousled, dominant presence. And how his mother, Maggie Smith, is present in the pervasive sardonic humour, and the camp spiralling of the neck as he looks down his princely nose at some idiot. Stephens extracts irony from lines in which actors usually find wistfulness. He laughs with a shiver of hysterical shock when he sees Yorick's skull. The astringency is a gain, but in moments of high emotion Stephens stands in need of Hamlet's own advice to the Players: to keep down the gestures and rhetorical quavers. He comes on like a Victorian tragedian, all shaken curls and curling lip. His voice wavers; he gazes broodingly into the middle distance; he runs his hands through his hair or uses them like little food mixers, to churn the air. Never has Hamlet's self-description 'I have that within which passes show' seemed so little true. Peter Hall's plan for his new Bath season is more than coherent, though the director's own description of it as featuring the inter-dependence of men and women doesn't get you very far: he might as well have said the plays were about human beings rather than anchovies. In fact, the interconnectedness of the dramas is a large part of the interest. Simon Nye's nimble version of Moli\u00e8re's Don Juan is partnered by Shaw's reworking of the Don Juan legend in Man and Superman. The Shaw play is clear-eyed about religious fanaticism; Galileo's Daughter - a version by Timberlake Wertenbaker of Dava Sobel's novel - sets its face against dogmatism of all kinds. Wertenbaker conjures up from sketchy historical data the biography of Galileo's gifted child, a nun who shared her father's passion for scientific investigation and rejected him when he recanted his blasphemous philosophical views. Weaving in echoes of other theatrical daughters - Cordelia and Lear and Chekhov's Three Sisters - her play becomes part of a larger feminist project: an argument with Brecht's Galileo , a recovery of lost female voices. Her voice is persuasive. Rebecca Hall - ardent and graceful - makes it easy to respond to this favoured daughter. Yet this is never more than a biopic. Michael Frayn's Copenhagen has changed the way scientific ideas can be put on stage. The principle of uncertainty that was that play's subject was enacted, both in its dissolving structure and in its human relationships. This makes any less interpenetrating play look dogged. The pun at the centre of Wertenbaker's drama - 'If I can understand the laws of motion, surely I can understand what moves you' - is too flimsy to weld together its ideas of emotional and intellectual upheaval. As Galileo, Julian Glover has little to do other than hobble and look baleful. Hammy modern scenes top and tail the action. And a creaky acting style often prevails: one bloke actually wrings his hands. Amazingly, Shaw's Man and Superman - though a muddle of the fatuous and the far-sighted - seems almost the more modern play. Its intellectual credentials are skimpy: the central 'argument' - that women are the real predators in love affairs, who let men think they're the pursuers - is just a bit of barstool nudge-and-wink philosophy. Shaw's justification for it - dashingly rendered - is a socialist one: everyone is governed by economic necessity. But when he wants to work in something that he can't be bothered to think out, he dumps all that and starts bawling fascist-style about the Life Force. Hopeless to stage, you might think. But the opening scenes fizz with energy and humour, particularly when they feature Will Keen and James Laurenson, and the epigram hit-rate is high throughout. The Don Juan in Hell dream sequence, which is usually cut, is staged, and well worth seeing as a prime piece of Shavian braggadocio - though once is enough. Shaw can't resist explaining what he's already shown. Which makes Superman hyper-long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
