Police said that 16 people had died in violence that erupted last night and continued for a second day today. The Argentinian government has declared a state of emergency to crack down on unrest after thousands of people took to the streets to protest at the apparent collapse of the economy. Police said that as many as 20,000 people took part in an orgy of looting in the capital Buenos Aires and other towns. Many of the dead were shot by shopkeepers trying to protect their stock. Riot police firing tear gas dispersed overnight protests outside the seat of government. Banks and restaurants were destroyed and the Israeli embassy in the capital city was attacked. Despite the state of emergency, demonstrators returned to the presidential palace today and were rounded up by police wielding batons. The crowds chanted for the resignation of the president Fernando de la Rua. Mr de la Rua accepted the resignation of his economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, who introduced a raft of austerity measures that sparked the worst violence seen in the country for many years. He is the third economy minister to resign in the past year. The entire cabinet tendered its resignation to the president. However, a government spokesman told Reuters news agency that Mr de la Rua had accepted only his economy minister's departure. The other ministers would stay, the spokesman said. This morning, more than 200 demonstrators, some beating drums and waving the Argentinian flag, chanted anti-government slogans outside the president's offices in downtown Plaza de Mayo in the capital, Buenos Aires. Riot police swept through the square, detaining at least seven of the protesters who were dragged to police vans, some kicking and resisting. Some banks and businesses reopened and people went to work, but many small shops remained shuttered for fear of further unrest. South America's second-largest economy, mired in its fourth straight year of recession, has been teetering on the brink of economic and political meltdown for several weeks. Yesterday's frenzied looting left at least 108 people injured. Police made 328 arrests. In a televised address to the nation last night, the president confirmed he was imposing a 30-day nationwide state of emergency, to \"guarantee law and order across the country\". This declaration of a \"state of siege\" merely provoked more anger from many Argentinians, whose patience with Mr de la Rua's administration appears to be exhausted. Argentina's jobless rate has soared to more than 18%. Austerity measures introduced by Mr Cavallo, including a partial bank freeze designed to prop up the financial system, triggered the discontent. Away from the president's residence, thousands of protesters also thronged outside government house in Buenos Aires, until riot police charged them, firing tear gas. Others rallied outside Mr Cavallo's home. \"It's great that Cavallo's gone,\" said actor Elena Sicilia, rushing toward government house after hearing about the minister's resignation on television. \"But they all have to go. We don't want De la Rua and we don't want [Carlos] Menem back,\" she said, referring to Mr de la Rua's predecessor. \"We want a fair government of the people.\" Invocation of a state of emergency marked the first time in 11 years that an Argentinian president had seized special powers that effectively grant security forces greater powers of arrest and allow them to ban public gatherings. Such measures were last used by President Menem in 1990 to quash an uprising by a rightwing anti-democratic militia group. The economy has worsened during Mr de la Rua's two years in office despite his government trying nine different economic plans. His administration has faced eight general strikes. Until yesterday, Mr Cavallo had been working on enacting another punishing austerity plan, pushing a belt-tightening 2002 budget through Congress and staving off a default on Argentina's \u00a390bn public debt. Agreement on the budget is seen as a pivotal factor in persuading the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to release almost a billion pounds of emergency funds that Argentina needs to keep up payments on its debt. Failure to secure IMF funding could lead to a default, which would probably herald yet more chaos and social unrest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
