My pre-match routine normally involves being one of the last players out and turning the lights off in the changing room. If I switch them off at Twickenham tomorrow the rest of the boys will be stumbling around in the dark. But if there was ever a moment to ditch an old ritual then this is a pretty good one. I could hardly turn down the job because of a superstition, could I? And, in every other respect, I'm determined to stay true to myself. Having taken a few seconds to savour the occasion in the tunnel, I'm planning to go out and play the same way I always do. I can't pretend not to be thrilled, though, at the prospect of becoming - so they tell me - England's 119th Test captain. As a kid the first skipper I can remember was Bill Beaumont. When he took over, the England team weren't particularly successful and I suppose you could draw certain parallels with the present day. But in terms of shaping my attitude my rugby heroes are the ones I've met as a player; people with something about them, such as Dean Richards and, of course, Martin Johnson. I've watched Johnno change over the years. When he started he wasn't an immense captain immediately but he found a way to become the great leader that he is. I've always felt one of his greatest strengths is that he's completely devoid of emotion; whether it's midweek training in a Leicester mudbath or extra-time in the World Cup final, he's exactly the same. That's the main thing I've been trying to focus on this week: I've got the captaincy, but I can't change who I am. I certainly wasn't expecting the call; personally I thought Ben Kay would get the nod. I called him last Thursday just before the news became public and, although we're great mates, he did admit he was disappointed. For everyone who gets something in rugby, somebody else usually misses out; for much of my career, that somebody has been me. Suddenly, though, it is like London buses: you wait for ages and then it all happens. Being in charge of the remote control is about as much power as I wield at home, but I think I play better rugby when I'm given some responsibility. I've always wanted to have a say in the running of a side, but at Leicester I've mostly had to smother that ambition with Johnno, Neil Back, Joel Stransky and Pat Howard running the show. It was fine by me because I could listen and learn, but now my turn has come. My immediate priority with England is simple. Let's be brutally honest: we need a win. If it means squeezing home 12-9 against Italy, then we'll take it. Of course we want to develop our style of play, but you can forget that tomorrow; we're all about winning, and the manner of it comes a distant second. It's a lot easier building for the future if you're winning games. We haven't been doing that and we've been underperforming. The hardest thing is knowing that other teams are playing for grand slams and championships and England are not part of it. That sinking feeling has only one positive side effect; we never want to be here again and experiences such as this toughen up teams and characters. That can be more valuable in the long term than having everything your own way. We have endured a massive slump but we feel we are moving in the right direction, if not as quickly as we'd like. At the minute, though, we've lost the aura which England have had. We've shattered it since the World Cup and it's now up to us to start rebuilding it. If we take it game by game and session by session, those little steps will eventually take us to where we want to be. Things, as I've discovered lately, can change very quickly. If I stuff up tomorrow there could easily be another captain next time. So amid all the pride and passion - all my family, including my two sisters, will be present - I've got to try and control my emotions. The psychological term for it is staying \"conscious\" and not allowing the moment to overtake you. I even write down a checklist of the reasons I'm here and what I need to do well to ensure I have a good game. Once you do that it's a very simple game. Could the last man out please switch off the lights for me?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
