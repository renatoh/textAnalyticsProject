Sadly, writer-producer Jez Butterworth and director Tate Taylor (The Help) stick to old cliches with this movie about James Brown, the legendary godfather of soul, and the music-biopic formula is tested to destruction and beyond. Chadwick Boseman\u2019s portrayal of Brown is strong and the movie certainly delivers some big songs. But its \u201cjukebox\u201d narrative style flashes back and forth between glibly mythologised scenes of Brown\u2019s childhood and adulthood, which could frankly have come from many other films. And the dark episodes \u2013 Brown terrifying people with guns, beating his wife \u2013 are treated by this film as instantly forgivable and forgettable aberrations from an adorable, quirky personality. The film never gets below the surface. In particular, the all-important adult reunion with his mother is muddled and fractured. The music gives you some big, sugar-rush moments, but it\u2019s a disappointing response to one of pop culture\u2019s most brilliant and complicated figures. \u2022 \u2018I got the feelin\u2019 \u2013 Chadwick Boseman on playing James Brown \u2022 The 10 worst music biopics ever made \u2022 From Hank to Hendrix and Joplin to Davis: the new wave of musical biopics"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
