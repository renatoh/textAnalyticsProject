The time for being polite is over", "bodyText": "Everyone was so polite. Not because they are naturally well-mannered, but because of a pragmatic judgment that to be \u201crespectful\u201d to Indonesia as a sovereign nation, respectful towards its judicial system, respectful to its political leaders, was the best way \u2013 the only way \u2013 to save two Australians from being taken out in the middle of the night and shot dead. Now that has happened and we can stop being polite. During the 72-hour \u201cnotice period\u201d given to the condemned men, Peter Morrissey, one of the lawyers for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, said the \u201cwhole approach has been to try to be polite, try to engage. If we try arm-twisting [the Indonesian government] we lose. Pressure will result in death.\u201d The Australian government performed the same dance. Apart from a cringeworthy moment from Tony Abbott when he asked Indonesia to \u201creciprocate\u201d for Australia\u2019s generosity after the 2004 tsunami by sparing the men, public pronouncements have been restrained. Not deferential, exactly, but careful to avoid criticism for fear it would be counterproductive. There was never a guarantee that pleas for mercy would work, of course, and they didn\u2019t. Just after midnight, Sukumaran, 34, and Chan, 31, were gunned down by firing squad on the prison island of Nusa Kambangan. Six other people were also shot in this \u201cbatch\u201d, as it\u2019s known, including five more foreign citizens. There was the 50-year-old Nigerian man convicted of possessing just 50g of heroin. And the 42-year-old Brazilian man diagnosed as suffering schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These were couriers, not kingpins. Dirt-poor Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Velosa, who has always insisted she was duped into carrying drugs, was spared at the last minute because the alleged recruiter gave herself up. If she hadn\u2019t, an innocent woman might have been put to death. The lives of \u201cour\u201d citizens are no more worthy than others, but when it\u2019s close to home you see the full horror of it. Watch the pro bono lawyers\u2019 frenzied attempts to pursue every legal option. Imagine the terror of human beings told the exact time of their death and asked if they wish to stand or sit, be blindfolded or look their executioners in the eye. Witness families go through such agony you know you should look away. How can anyone respond to this? About 250,000 people signed a petition to president Joko Widodo asking him to spare Chan and Sukumaran\u2019s lives. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was something. There were some who insisted that the pair had got what they deserved, but thousands attended rallies in support of the men, just 21 and 24 when they helped organise an attempt to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. On Tuesday night, candlelight vigils were held across the country. Some have lashed out, urging Australians to \u201cboycott Bali\u201d to protest the killing. It might be an emotional response, even a bit naff given our reputation of yobbo behaviour in Bali. But it\u2019s also a sign of impotence, of a sense that nothing could be done to stop the pointless death of two men who by every account \u2013 including that of the former head of the prison where they were held \u2013 were completely reformed. Sukumaran furiously painted his haunting self-portraits until the last. Chan married his girlfriend the day before he died, and asked to attend church. In jail, he had studied theology and become a pastor. Sukumaran had almost finished a fine arts degree. Now we can say what these deaths were \u2013 the torture and murder of human beings by a neighbouring state. We do not need to spare feelings for fear of being seen as arrogant westerners or hold back because Australia is so far from perfect \u2013 witness our treatment of asylum seekers, witness the outrage of phone tapping the former Indonesian president\u2019s wife. Nothing excuses what Indonesia has done. This was about domestic politics and president Widodo\u2019s determination to be tough in the face of foreign pressure. There was a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia for four years. In 2013 it was lifted because of a \u201cdrugs emergency\u201d. Widodo announced late last year he would reject the clemency bids of all 64 drug dealers on death row before he had even seen them. If we told the truth, we would say that Indonesian attorney general HM Prasetyo has seemed to relish his role. It was repulsive for him to announce that the date of the execution would be put back so it wouldn\u2019t clash with an Asian African conference because \u201cit doesn\u2019t look good when we have guests to shoot them [the prisoners]\u201d, as if would look just fine some other time. Prasetyo scoffed at legal appeals and predicted they would fail before they were heard. He saw nothing morally questionable in his argument that even if Chan and Sukumaran won their constitutional court case challenging the president\u2019s clemency deliberations \u2013 a case set down for 12 May \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have mattered because it wouldn\u2019t be retrospective. \u201cI hear they\u2019re going to challenge to the constitutional court. Go ahead!\u201d he mocked. Several of those executed had legal appeals still under way, which Prasetyo dismissed as \u201cbuying time\u201d. At the last minute, there were corruption allegations so serious that to execute someone without investigating them is a moral crime, if not a legal one. Indonesia is trying to clean up its judicial system, but corruption persists, and an attempted bribe in a death penalty case is not unthinkable. In February, Muhammad Rifan, the former lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, made a complaint to Indonesia\u2019s judicial commission which oversees investigations into judicial corruption. He told Fairfax Media that nothing happened after his complaint \u2013 the commission had not even interviewed him. This week, he revealed the details of his allegations. He said he had several meetings with the judges during the trial, and that they had asked for more than A$130,000 to bring down a sentence of less than 20 years. Such meetings are illegal but \u201cnormal\u201d in Indonesia, said Rifan. He says the deal collapsed after the judges told him that senior legal and government members \u2013 the attorney general\u2019s office and the supreme court \u2013 had ordered them to impose the death penalty. A lawyer for another condemned man, Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, has also claimed a judge offered a prison sentence rather than death if a bribe was paid. There is no more serious allegation than this, yet Indonesia\u2019s response was astonishingly complacent. Why has the investigation into these allegations been so slow? What happens if it is found that the claims are true and the men were already dead? It didn\u2019t worry Prasetyo. \u201cWhy in the last seconds has this just been conveyed?\u201d he asked. So now, what do we do? There will be angry words and unspeakable grief. Yet something about the aftermath of death penalty cases is as predictable as their lead-up. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop has said there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d for these deaths, and no one criticises her tireless attempts to save these men\u2019s lives. Australia\u2019s ambassador was recalled instantly on Wednesday morning, and there has been talk of cancelling meetings and postponing military cooperation. Brazil and the Netherlands also recalled their ambassadors after the first \u201cbatch\u201d of foreign drug offenders were executed in January, but they returned after a few weeks. The government is dismayed that its respectful pleas for clemency, or at least that legal appeals be exhausted before the executions were carried out, were rebuffed with such contempt. Indonesia may not have realised the executions would cause such international condemnation and scrutiny of their legal system. The mood in Australia is mostly horror and the government\u2019s response is likely to be strong. It is too late for those killed, but perhaps this will be a turning point in Indonesia, too. Yet pragmatists know how things work. Australia\u2019s relationship with Indonesia \u2013 its economic and strategic relationship \u2013 is too important to be damaged by this. \u201cLet\u2019s remember that a good relationship with Indonesia is very important to this country and whatever might happen in the next few days the relationship with Indonesia must endure,\u201d Abbott said recently. After a few days, we are likely to be urged to keep this into perspective. Philip Flood, former ambassador to Indonesia, said the suggestion that people boycott Bali was \u201ca silly idea, all that will do is penalise those Australians looking forward to an attractive holiday in Bali\u201d. The truth is, he said, we have \u201cvery, very few options, other than, you know the strongest possible protests\u201d. Yet the only power ordinary people have is consumer power, their choice about where to spend their money. Yes, the United States, China, Saudi Arabia and others have the death penalty too, despite no evidence that it deters crime. Yet this case, the details of it, the cruelty of it, has been crushing to watch. Lex Lasry, a Victorian supreme court judge, represented Australian Van Tuong Nguyen before he was executed for drug trafficking in Singapore in 2005. He has campaigned against the death penalty since and visited Chan and Sukumaran in jail. Lasry tweeted last month: \u201cI will never again go to Bali or anywhere in Indonesia. I am without adequate words for the hideous event that is about to occur.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, as pointless as it may be, I won\u2019t go back to Indonesia either until it abolishes the death penalty. Maybe it\u2019s a silly idea, and real politic will take over soon enough. But as Lasry says, this was \u201cstate-sanctioned murder\u201d. For this, Indonesia and its leaders deserve no respect and there\u2019s no polite way to say it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
