Why, if the two are so close, does the matter of whether and in what capacity David would serve under Ed \u2013 should the latter win the contest \u2013 have to be done through aides? Can't the brothers just pick up a phone or discuss it over dinner? Val Harrison Birmingham \u2022 This week I received a letter, posted in Nottingham in an envelope marked with the familiar Royal Mail postage-paid business frank, delivered to my door by a local taxi. On the back was a stamped message giving a freephone number to phone if it was delivered incorrectly and saying not to post it via Royal Mail. Can anyone tell me what is going on? Helen Bowyer Inverness \u2022 The correspondence about theme tunes (Letters, 24 September) is being needlessly prolonged by the failure to use the authorised (by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore) \"bum titty bum\" system of notation, which does provide for some notes half the duration of the others and for such critical analysis as: \"You've got a 'bum' where your 'titty' should be.\" DBC Reed Northampton \u2022 I was wearing a Trotsky badge in the 70s (Letters, 24 September) when a young guy asked why I had Colonel Sanders on my lapel. I think I knew then that the revolution was doomed. Roy George St Lawrence, Isle of Wight \u2022 I've got the best political badge, dating to late November 1990: \"What a year! Mandela \u2013 Out! Thatcher \u2013 Out!\" John Haycock London \u2022 How about \"Don't blame me, guv. I vote Green\"? Charles Harris London \u2022 That was a marrow escape (Woman sees off bear attack \u2013 with a courgette, 23 September).
