This is the question posed to Anna Madrigal \u2013 ANNA MADRIGAL! \u2013 in the opening frames of Netflix\u2019s Tales of the City reboot. \u201cHmmm,\u201d replies the original house mother, straight to camera, in that fabulously bone-dry, bone-loving slooooow tone that only Olympia Dukakis \u2013 OLYMPIA DUKAKIS! \u2013 can pull off. \u201cNot much actually. We\u2019re still people aren\u2019t we? Flawed, narcissistic and doing our best.\u201d As for Lauren Morelli\u2019s respectful reimagining of Tales of the City, executive produced by Armistead Maupin and the result of an all-queer writers\u2019 room, it\u2019s \u2026 flawed, narcissistic and doing its best. Sometimes it\u2019s doing its best a bit too hard, which I guess is to be expected when the stakes are this high and the original \u2013 both books and mini-series \u2013 this fiercely loved. After all, Tales of the City remains the first proper home of generations of LGBT+ people. Our very own 28 Barbary Lane located in the spacious, open-aspected, radical mind of Maupin. This matters. Happily, lots of it feels right. It\u2019s 20 years on and we\u2019re back at Barbary Lane, which according to the consumer law of sequels is considerably bigger (Escher levels of decking, stairs and, erm, fairy lights), more aspirational and less fabulous than the original. It\u2019s Anna\u2019s 90th birthday party and Mary Ann Singleton (Laura Linney), the prodigal straight, anally retentive daughter, returns to San Francisco older, sadder, no wiser and just as square as ever. \u201cI tried Googling what to wear to a 90-year-old\u2019s birthday party in San Francisco and pictures of Cher kept coming up,\u201d she wails, pitching up in a Next-level tea dress to the queer shindig of the century. Which is also too self-consciously hip and moneyed. She comes with a dodgy conventional husband in tow, a barely closeted homophobe who by the end of the first episode is daring her to go off \u201cfrolicking with the freaks\u201d. He declares he will never understand \u201cthose people\u201d. To which Mary Ann, one of literature\u2019s great innocents, softly replies: \u201cThose people are my family.\u201d Some of the things that simply should happen do happen, such as Mary Ann and Anna locking tearful gazes across the party and then disappearing upstairs to get high. \u201cReality is overrated,\u201d Anna declares, exhaling deeply. Or Mouse, keeping well on his antiretrovirals and newly in love, chiding Mary Ann for her earnestness because \u201cwho\u2019s earnest any more\u201d? Or Anna\u2019s laconic speech about what life at 90 looks like: \u201cYou don\u2019t wish for what\u2019s to come. You revel in what\u2019s already here.\u201d Which, by the way, is also sage advice on how to approach the new Tales of the City. The new generation of Mrs Madrigal\u2019s children \u2013 \u201cI call them my children \u2026 because they are,\u201d she says, appley cheeks ablaze with love \u2013 are harder work (with the caveat that I might just be a moany old bi). This is where TotC veers into try-hard territory. For instance, the young droll lesbian making a documentary about \u201cqueer community and its disillusion as a result of strangling grip that capitalism has on San Francisco\u201d. A line that lands with an I\u2019ve-just-swallowed-the-little-dictionary-of-Judith-Butler-sized clunk, and extraordinarily is also intended as a come-on. To be fair the response, by the equally droll queer cool cat Shawna (Ellen Page), who is the adopted daughter of Mary Ann and her ex-husband Brian and is basically Shane from The L Word dispatched from LA to San Fran, is: \u201cDo you always talk like that?\u201d Spoiler: she does. And it works. They end up shagging in an alleyway. Elsewhere, a previously lesbian and now queer couple are negotiating their way through one person\u2019s transition with too much telling, not showing: \u201cYou\u2019re excited Jake \u2013 you\u2019re passing [as straight] and you\u2019re excited!\u201d And some twins have turned their bodies into live art for an Instagram account called Twintertainment1. There\u2019s a sense that it\u2019s trying to be all things to all people and generations. An understandable attempt to please that unfortunately results in a dilution of the original\u2019s radicalism, mischief and warmth. Nevertheless, even in this world where the once solo-existing chronicle of queer life now jostles for space alongside everything from Pose to Queer Eye, we need Tales of the City as much, if not more, than ever. So as Mouse says, arms outstretched on the (much bigger) lawn at 28 Barbary Lane, \u201cwelcome home, babycakes\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
