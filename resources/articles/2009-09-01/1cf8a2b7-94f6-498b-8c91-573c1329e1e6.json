It is easy to romanticise New Guinea, the second largest island on the planet, as well as the least explored and the most diverse. It stands out; a different place in a homogenous age, home of perhaps 1,000 languages, 12,000 cultures, biological diversity and extraordinary geography. Its summits are snow-capped - when, in 1623, a Dutch sailor first reported seeing them he was mocked for suggesting glaciers could be found in the tropics. And New Guinea's rain forests remain less ravaged than most. The temptation is to dream of a lost world, an idea given impetus this week by a remarkable BBC film from inside the kilometre-deep crater of Mount Bosavi, in the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea. Seen by 4 million people on Tuesday, the film showed waterfalls pouring from caves into a perfect forest, and a giant tame rat, apparently new to science, nibbling a leaf, unafraid of humans. If the programme raises awareness of New Guinea's natural treasures, then it will have achieved something good. But the sad truth is that New Guinea faces difficulties familiar to the rest of the planet: climate change is melting the glaciers, loggers are cutting its forests and the relics of imperial power play haunt its politics. Papua New Guinea, the western half of the island, gained independence in 1975 (though the Queen remains head of state). Former Dutch territory in the east, is now run, despite protest, by Indonesia. The island may look like paradise, but it is at risk of becoming a paradise lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
