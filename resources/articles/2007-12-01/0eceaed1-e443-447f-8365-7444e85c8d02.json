One organiser predicted hundreds of people would be outside big storage installations but said there would be no blockades of deliveries of petrol and diesel. \"We don't want to spoil Christmas shopping for the general public,\" said David Handley, chairman of Farmers for Action and a member of Transaction 2007, a pressure group urging further action next year if the government does not respond to complaints. The government, oil industry and police have contingency plans to control any possible rerun of the 2000 protests, which included blockades, convoys and rolling roadblocks. Downing Street was shaken by the success of that campaign. Better preparation against threats of terrorism and the need to keep supplies of fuel and food in emergencies mean ministers and the oil industry will be ready this time. The government will also seek to win a PR battle as unease about Britain's high fuel taxes compared with the rest of Europe escalates. Ministers are likely to point to areas of life where taxes are higher in other countries. Handley, a dairy farmer from Monmouthshire, said: \"I would advise anyone who runs any vehicle of any description to fill up by Saturday. We will be totally legal. There will be no blockade with lorries, tractors or whatever.\" He said that unless the government set up a meeting to hear complaints, the protests would start again after Christmas, and \"I think everyone knows what that will involve\". Transaction 2007 says on its website that protests \"at a refinery or storage depot near you\" have been set for Saturday so protesters who would normally be working could attend. Concerns about fuel prices are shared by road hauliers and the oil industry. Fuel duty on diesel is more than 50p a litre and VAT is added at the pump, taking prices above \u00a31. The Road Haulage Association, while recognising that some of its 9,000 members support Transaction 2007, distanced itself from the organisation. It said that \"comments within Transaction 2007 suggesting that legal and peaceful protests would produce no results and that more direct action should be taken are unacceptable\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
