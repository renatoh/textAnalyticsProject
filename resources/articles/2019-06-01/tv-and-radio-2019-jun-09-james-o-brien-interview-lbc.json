Described as \u201cthe conscience of liberal Britain\u201d, O\u2019Brien is the author of the bestselling book How to Be Right...In a World Gone Wrong, a guide to challenging those who hold \u201cunchallenged opinions\u201d. How do you respond to critics of your show who say that it isn\u2019t a fair fight between you and your listeners, because you have the upper hand and can interrupt at will? It is a fair fight, because I\u2019ve been on the radio for 16 years. I have what I suppose you could call a reputation. The clips that go viral are watched by millions and millions of people, so anyone who rings me [must be] certain they\u2019re going to get the better of me. Occasionally, you get the sense that someone might be vulnerable and then you take your foot off the pedal, because there is no pleasure in beating up someone intellectually who sounds a bit unwell. I interrupt because you can\u2019t come on the radio and say things that are untrue. I\u2019m not interested in opinions unless they\u2019re based on fact and, tragically, too many places in the media, particularly with regards to politicians, will allow people to say things that are simply not true and leave them unchallenged. How often do you think you change people\u2019s minds? Not as often as I\u2019d like. I had a chap at a festival of debate a few weeks ago who was a fully paid up member of the EDL before he started listening to my show and he stood up in front of 600 people and said: \u201cI think you saved my life.\u201d Those moments are incredibly important to me, but that\u2019s extreme. I\u2019m not arrogant or naive enough to think I\u2019m moving the needle on national conversation anywhere near enough. If you call your book How to Be Right, is it fair for people to accuse you of being smug? I think people who peddle lies for a living call people who tell the truth smug. I\u2019m not smug \u2013 smug would mean I was enjoying this. Your book dismantles the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic views that you encounter on your show. But how much hostility or change in attitudes have you noticed in your day-to-day life? I\u2019m a white heterosexual male and despite what many people are currently arguing, I remain the most privileged constituency on the planet\u2026 I don\u2019t have [that] experience. The mystery is how much of [this] there has always been and how much of it you now have because of emboldening. I\u2019d argue it was already there, but the lid has simply been lifted. Sure. You\u2019ve got Farage on the radio just flirting, knowing exactly where the line is, and Donald Trump crossing the line on a daily basis. So we\u2019re seeing people, prominent people, incredibly powerful people saying these things and the \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster [Farage\u2019s 2016 anti-migrant poster] \u2013 there is no way you can unveil that poster in public and not think some people will think it\u2019s OK to spit at brown-skinned people in the street. It\u2019s the scale of how much the recent rhetoric of invasion, about cultural identity and about values being eroded \u2013 which is all bollocks \u2013 has impacted on beliefs. People who believe it find a logic to their anger. Do you feel people are fundamentally good? Of course I do; you have to. Look at the effort being put in to make people believe bad things: the effort is immense, it\u2019s the richest people on the planet, the most powerful media owners, it\u2019s the demagogues with the biggest platforms, the season ticket holders on Question Time. There is a commercial and audience imperative in this country where if it gets chatter going and it gets clicks, a big reaction, then it must be good. But of course, when ordinary punters watch this stuff, they don\u2019t see a circus or bonfire, they just get seduced by the narcissism and you don\u2019t have good tunes if you\u2019re on the side of kindness and decency \u2013 you have nothing to point at. You sound defeated even by the fightback! It\u2019s pathetic. It\u2019s astonishing; the factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories or in the last few years, the government. They\u2019re obsessed with centrists, they\u2019re obsessed with Blairites, they\u2019re obsessed with denying antisemitism when it\u2019s right there in front of them, so all that has incubated the problem. Does a career in traditional politics beckon for you? I have a silent rule that anyone who wants to go into politics should be banned \u2013 you should be forced to go into politics by plebiscite because people think you could bring something to the table. So it\u2019s highly unlikely. Given the success of the Brexit party, Farage might believe the same applies to himself? Farage is simply a very very good heckler. He couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering Brexit, he couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering policy, he couldn\u2019t be involved in putting together a proper manifesto or assembling a proper political party, all he can do is assemble a dizzying array of rotten tomatoes, stand at the side of the stage and lob them at the poor sods who are trying to make some sense of the current matter. You\u2019ve just been on holiday \u2013 what did you enjoy reading? I\u2019m halfway through The Ministry of Truth, Dorian Lynskey\u2019s biography of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it\u2019s absurdly good. What was the last thing that made you laugh? My 13-year-old daughter is addicted to Saturday Night Live sketches on YouTube and Pete Davidson\u2019s character Chad brings me pretty close to wetting myself every time I watch him. How do you relax and switch off? Crime fiction. We live near the Thames and I like to walk the dog there as often as I can. I love walking up to Brentford where there\u2019s still a boatyard and a real sense of when the river was an industrial hub. And I try to play Fifa on the PlayStation once a week with one of my oldest friends \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing so for nearly 30 years! I keep meaning to take up meditation properly but can\u2019t find the time. \u2022 How to Be Right\u2026 in a World Gone Wrong is out now in paperback (WH Allen, \u00a38.99).
