The Liverpool manager faces Manchester City for the second time in four days on Wednesday still bruised by Sunday\u2019s penalty shootout defeat in the Capital One Cup final but adamant his players will learn from the experience. The contest may have demonstrated the extent of the rebuilding work required at Anfield, at least in terms of challenging such leading clubs as City for honours, but that has only hardened Klopp\u2019s resolve to succeed. And he believes his patience, work ethic and ability to withstand pressure makes him the ideal man for the job. \u201cI am 100% excited about the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets better and better by the way. Why? Because I know more. I am not the cleverest but I love the challenge. When I was younger I thought I had no chance to be part of professional football so I wanted to study medicine. I wanted to help people. I like to change things and help if it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s a hard way to go. I don\u2019t know what other names FSG would have taken but I think I am a really perfect solution. I like this. I am patient enough to work for the moment and then we can change things. \u201cOn Sunday with a bit of luck we could have won the game. If Divock Origi makes that header it\u2019s 2-1 and then you are asking a different question but it\u2019s the same situation, just without a bit of silverware in our hands. To become successful in the future we need to learn a lot of things. The first thing is that you really need to work to get there. We can\u2019t be successful just because of the history of the club or the name of the manager or the names of the players. The way we play football is influenced by a few things \u2013 how we train and which players we have. We have to change a lot of things to be successful.\u201d Liverpool face new obstacles next season, not least the arrival of Pep Guardiola at City, but Klopp believes the days when Anfield or Old Trafford played regular host to the league title are over. By extension, City\u2019s wealth and the impact of his former rival at Bayern Munich hold no fear for the Liverpool manager. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible in this world of football to be successful in England five or six years in a row. Nobody can win the league five or six years in a row because the financial potential of all the teams is too big. But always to be a part of this and to be a challenger is possible. That\u2019s what we have to be in the future. To do that we have to make decisions. \u201cI feel absolutely perfect here, not after losing a final but the next day because I know everyone here is working so hard. They need a bit of a help. And they need a big hand from someone who is patient enough and can handle the pressure from the outside. I can handle this. \u201cI am only interested in Liverpool FC. If I had gone to another club would it have been easier? They would have had other problems. Next season Pep Guardiola will find that it\u2019s more rainy in Manchester than it is here or in Munich. Every day isn\u2019t easy. And they will be big favourites so that\u2019s another problem. We have problems but we are in a good way to solve them. How long we need for this? Time is very important. All we can change to become a good side we will do.\u201d Liverpool have announced that revenue for the year ending 31 May 2015 increased 16.5% to a record \u00a3297.9m. Profit before tax was \u00a360m compared with \u00a3900,000 in 2014 but the former figure was largely based on the sale of Luis Su\u00e1rez to Barcelona. The accounts also reveal Liverpool\u2019s owner, Fenway Sports Group, converted \u00a369m of debt into equity and invested \u00a349m into the initial redevelopment of the Main Stand at Anfield. The club\u2019s net external debt stands at \u00a347m compared with \u00a3237m when FSG acquired the club from Tom Hicks and George Gillett via the high court in 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
