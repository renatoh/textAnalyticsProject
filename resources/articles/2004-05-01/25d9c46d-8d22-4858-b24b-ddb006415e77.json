The Bantams are in the grips of a second administration with reported debts of \u00a336m and they face crunch talks at a creditors' meeting on Friday. But amid speculation that the club are on the brink of closure, the club secretary Jon Pollard remains upbeat. He said: \"The creditors' meeting will go ahead and further negotiations will take place in that. Players have been made aware of the dire financial situation and, as you might expect, they have been told that if they can find other clubs they should as it is in their best interests.\" Pollard has also played down suggestions that the Bantams, relegated to the Second Division next term, may be forced to ground-share at Odsal Stadium with the rugby league side Bradford Bulls. The high court yesterday ruled that Wimbledon must pay only a third of the \u00a31m they owe to the Inland Revenue. The Revenue, concerned about the consequences of a decision that sets a legal precedent over its status as a preferential creditor, will appeal. Under Football League rules, Wimbledon will be ejected from the competition if the Inter MK consortium that recently bought the club cannot bring it out of administration before July 31. Alan Pardew stands to receive a multimillion-pound transfer budget if he can secure promotion for West Ham via the play-offs, after the Upton Park board agreed to make available a significant proportion of next season's expected broadcasting revenue. \"It would be up to the manager how to spend it. I can't be precise but I can make an educated assumption and the vast majority of that [\u00a320m] will be made available\" said West Ham's finance director Nick Igoe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
