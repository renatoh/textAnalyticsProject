He said all of digital TV had proved an absolute licence to lose money. \"NTL is virtually broke. Sky has lost \u00a31bn, ITV Digital has lost \u00a31bn. If this is competition, then please bring back monopoly.\" Speaking on Murdoch-owned Sky News, Mr Elstein was dismissive of the entire digital terrestrial television project, describing it as a \"disaster\" and noting that the cost could largely be picked up by consumers. \"What digital terrestrial television offered was a low-grade version of multi-channel television which the government, for whatever reason, wanted. \"Primarily out of paranoia over Murdoch this adventure is going to cost the consumer a huge amount of money - \u00a310bn to the public purse; mostly through hidden costs, but nontheless pretty real. Today Mr Elstein also said he had \"no sympathy\" for the Football League, many of whose clubs claim to be facing meltdown after ITV Digital went into administration yesterday. \"They were warned before they went into this contract that ITV Digital was a dodgy proposition,\" said Mr Elstein, adding that the clubs \"can take the risk, frankly\". He said the clubs merely had to pass the risk on to the players. \"They can say: 'have a job with some money' or 'have no job'. \"All they have to do is pass the risk to the players,\" he added. Asked to speculate on the future of the ITV Digital football contracts, Mr Elstein suggested that Carlton or Granada could buy out the contracts. He also gave Sky or another consortium as possible buyers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
