Throughout my twenties the hotel experience had meant handing out excessive sums of money to stay in a room your grandmother might have decorated - but only when blind drunk. A painful assault of patterns and fabrics would hit you the moment you opened the door. If your own revelries hadn't left you with a hangover, you were guaranteed to get one from the d\u00e9cor. It wasn't just the bedrooms that were stuck in a timewarp. The bathrooms seemed trapped in the Fif-ties, with plastic shower attachments, towelling toilet seat covers and an array of napkin-sized towels with embroidered edges. Cuisine that was a curious hybrid of suburban and nouvelle often made breakfast the most palatable meal of the day. So the advent of the designer hotel, an oasis of modern comforts, with crisp white sheets, power showers and DVD machines, came as a welcome change. Hotels were transformed overnight from venues of shame to venues for shame. Where previously you'd have nervously donned a Christmas cracker wedding ring in preparation for disparaging glances from the morality police at reception, hotels were now proud to declare themselves the very dens of iniquity they'd been pretending not to be. Sexual abandon was actively en-couraged - there were suddenly baths in bedrooms, strategically placed mirrors, a plethora of lotions, condoms in bedside drawers, an emphasis on privacy and the possibility to eat every single meal of your stay without leaving your room. I hate to seem ungrateful, but the homogenisation that followed has begun to seem a high price to pay. I remember the writer Lynda La Plante regaling me at a dinner with her story about a stressful stay in one of Miami's South Beach state-of-the-art hotels. On arrival she spent 20 minutes looking for the light switches in an all-white room reminiscent of a cell for the fashionably insane. Admitting defeat, she called the concierge, who said she wasn't the first to be bemused, before pointing out that the switches were hidden behind white plastic covers on the white walls. Having managed to achieve illumination, she moved into the bathroom, where she spent a further 10 minutes searching for the taps to turn on the shower. Almost scared to death by the toilet when it began to self-flush, she'd reached a state of frustration and near hysteria when she hit a button above the bowl, which (hey presto!) turned on the shower. My own experiences have been equally traumatic. I remember an entire weekend at the Paramount in New York spent stumbling around, hands in front of me, warding off unseen hazards in the nightclub-style lighting that pervades the hotel's corridors. Fellow guests shuffled past in the gloaming like silhouettes, nodding at nowhere in particular in their blind attempts at greeting. Those old feelings of trepidation and unworthiness I thought I'd banished began welling up in advance of a weekend away. Would my clothes be as trendy as the bar staff's? Would I face on arrival - as I did at the Royalton (again in New York) - a line-up of female staff who all looked like Yasmin Le Bon? My love affair with the designer hotel finally ended when I found myself in another dimly-lit hotel room searching in vain for a bedside light. There were candles, bubble bath and six types of mineral water in the fridge, but not a bedside light in sight. Eventually I called for help and a handsome teenager turned up resplendent in a polo neck and corduroys, the hotel uniform that my husband had unfortunately echoed in his weekend packing. This whippersnapper politely informed me that guests didn't normally come there to read, but he'd try to sort me out with something! Talk about feeling your age. So when we decided to head to Paris for Valentine's weekend I had one stipulation. I wanted to stay in a good, old-fashioned establishment with proper light switches and toilets that flushed manually. The Hotel Lancaster on Rue de Berri fitted my requirements perfectly. The woman who checked us in definitely looked like staff, utterly charming but wearing an ugly beige suit that already had me feeling superior. Our room was an oasis of calm and elegance, yet there wasn't a white wall in sight! Instead we entered a vast elegant salon in shades of lilac and vanilla, with silk-upholstered Louis XVI chairs, a plumped-up day bed and working lamps made ingeniously from glass pharmaceutical jars filled with water and lilac ink to give them a translucent shimmer. The crisp cotton sheets were by Frette, a super-expensive Italian bedding company, and the light switches could be identified at a glance. And yes, it had mod cons too: a DVD and CD player, a video and a vast television dwarfed by the proportions of the room itself. The mini-bar was subtly curtained off by chinoiserie that matched the thick damask curtains. While huge oil paintings of flowers adorned the walls, the rooms were alive with the fresh variety: orchids in the living room and bedroom; gorgeous little orange roses and berries in the bathroom. I was most excited by the old-fashioned marble bathroom, boasting appliances that needed no explanation: real English taps marked 'hot' and 'cold' or 'on' and 'off'. No mistakes could be made. Breakfast arrived on a table, with not a tray or trendy mug in sight. The china matched the fabric in our room - little silver jugs containing hot and cold milk, an array of homemade preserves from blueberry to apricot and freshly made compotes. Live yoghurt on a bed of raspberry puree and stewed apple and cinnamon on rice pudding completed the feast. If I'd looked out of the window and seen Greta Garbo and Noel Coward holding hands, I wouldn't have been surprised. They are both former guests. I was so overcome by the pleasures of departing the modern world for a few days that I nipped off to a flea market in the Bastille and picked up a vintage Forties satin nightdress. For the rest of the weekend I flounced around pretending I was Marlene Dietrich, after whom our suite was named - she used it as her Paris abode for a number of years. When finally persuaded out of the room by my stir-crazy husband, I made my eighth attempt to ascend the Eiffel Tower but was again defeated by the size of the queue. I know it's against French principles to learn from the English, but they would do well to talk to the London Eye team about a pre-booking system. I may not have ascended their most famous landmark but at least in the Hotel Lancaster I felt as if I was in Paris, not in some homo-genised room that could have been anywhere from Miami to Mauritius. Modern has come to be shorthand for interchangeable. The omnipresent limestone bathrooms, chrome fittings and oriental prints trap travellers in a global design warp. It's a state of affairs brilliantly conveyed in Sofia Coppola's recent movie Lost in Translation. Tokyo and New York become interchangeable the moment Bill Murray slips the key into his hotel room door. Hip hotel aficionados will all have experienced rooms where the TV remote was a challenge too far, the plumbing 50 years ahead of them and the d\u00e9cor so stark that unpacking seemed like an act of sabotage. So let's embrace what the first wave of designer hotels got right - plumbing, service and decent-sized beds and bedding - and then start to take chances again. Call me old-fashioned, but I want my bedroom away from home to surprise and delight me and deliver a flavour of the place I'm visiting, whether it's a stately home in the Cots-wolds or a Maldivian desert island. Dispensing with the chintz doesn't have to mean entering a Huxley-style universe where rooms and people are all interchangeable. As the Hotel Lancaster proves, you can be modern without kissing personality goodbye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
