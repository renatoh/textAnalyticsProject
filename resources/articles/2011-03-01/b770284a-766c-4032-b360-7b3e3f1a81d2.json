Icelanders were proud to call it a Business Viking revolution. Among the deals financed and assets devoured were household names such as Hamleys, West Ham United, Somerfield, Iceland Foods, the fashion chains All Saints, Oasis and Karen Millen, and pub chains Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates. By October 2008, however, it all ended in tears. Iceland experienced one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns ever seen: one of the world's richest nations per capita, with a population of just 315,000, was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The crisis pushed several one-time billionaire tycoons into insolvency and destroyed the country's big three banks, the largest and most aggressive of which was Kaupthing. Previously Iceland was lauded by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, but last year a 2,300-page truth commission report for the Icelandic parliament painted a picture of a financial system out of control. A decade earlier Kaupthing had been a tiny brokerage. Its spectacular growth is credited largely to the ambitions of executive chairman Sigurdur Einarsson, who for years based himself in Mayfair offices shared with the bank's UK subsidiary Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander (KSF). His office was a short corridor away from that of KSF chief executive, Armann Thorvaldsson. In many respects the bank had outgrown Iceland and much of its activities were conducted from Britain. Most investment banking operations were conducted in London, many clients were British-based and, in 2008 at least, about \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a33bn) poured into KSF from UK savers in the shape of online deposits in its high-interest online account Kaupthing Edge. Kaupthing bankers became the talk of the town, financing deals other banks could not make work, and developing close relationships with billionaire tycoons previously used to dealing with more established banks. The bank's largest client was investor Robert Tchenguiz, whose offices in Curzon Street were a short walk away. Some Kaupthing bosses, like the Tchenguiz brothers, enjoyed Mayfair's top restaurants and nightclubs. One controversial deal was allegedly struck over a meal at Scott's restaurant, though, according to bank liquidators, little paperwork was left behind. Thorvaldsson's book, Frozen Assets: How I lived Iceland's boom and bust, recalls arm-wrestling contests and nightclub excursions during a lavish Icelandic fishing trip for the KSF client Gordon Ramsay; hiring Tom Jones to sing at a private party for 200 guests at the Natural History Museum; and an extravagant St Tropez lunch where a waiter dressed as Spider-Man sprayed the contents of a Melchizedek \u2013 a 30-litre champagne bottle \u2013 over guests including a Russian billionaire sat on a throne and the former chairman of one of the UK's largest banks. At the Monaco grand prix, Thorvaldsson recalls: \"We knew so many people that we hopped from one yacht to another,\" name-dropping the retail entrepreneurs Mike Ashley and Sir Tom Hunter , property developers the Candy Brothers and currency trader Joe Lewis \u2013 all of whom became clients. \"We socialised and networked at high-profile events at venues such as Elton John's home, the Winter Palace in St Petersburg and Hampton Court Palace \u2026 I sat at tables with Elle Macpherson and Sting, and stood at urinals with Rod Stewart and Hugh Grant on either side of me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
