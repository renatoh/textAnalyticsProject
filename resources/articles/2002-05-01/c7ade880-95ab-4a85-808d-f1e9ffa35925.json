O'Neill's fellow midfielder Marcelo Romero is also doubtful after damaging an ankle and he was forced to train on his own. Mexico cancelled their 10am training session yesterday morning in Mikuni so that the squad could concentrate on the climax of their domestic national championship which ended with America's title showdown with Necaxa. America's victory was good news for the striker Luis Hernandez, but not for the Necaxa midfielder Braulio Luna. \"I suffered a lot watching the game on television but I am really happy now,\" said America's Hernandez. \"I'm happy for the championship but sad because I wasn't there,\" added team-mate German Villa. When training resumed later in the day Alberto Rodriguez and Rafael Garcia returned to the fray following injury worries. \"I'm really optimistic. They worked fine and now I have almost all the players ready,\" said Mexico's coach Javier Aguirre. \"The doctors told me to play normally, and I felt no pains. I guess I will be right for the opener,\" added Garcia. \"I am perfectly fine. I was shooting with the ball and I had no fear. I can't wait to play,\" claimed Rodriguez. Internazionale are to announce the signing of Paraguay's defender Carlos Gamarra later this week. Gamarra, who is expected to be a key player for Paraguay at the World Cup, spent last season on loan at AEK Athens from the Brazilian side Flamengo. \"Internazionale have agreed a deal with Paraguay international Carlos Gamarra for two seasons,\" an Inter spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
