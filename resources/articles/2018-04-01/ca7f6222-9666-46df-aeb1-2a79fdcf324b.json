Liverpool have been charged by Uefa after the City team coach was damaged outside Anfield before kick\u2011off but it was the noise inside that Oxlade-Chamberlain has cited as having the greater influence on the first leg. City\u2019s manager and players were dismissive of the effect of the Anfield atmosphere on their performance but that was contradicted by the England international, who admitted he knew from experience with Arsenal how it can have a major influence. \u201cIt was an amazing atmosphere, the best I\u2019ve ever played in,\u201d said Oxlade-Chamberlain, who struck a superb second goal in Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 victory. \u201cYou have to give credit to the fans because it is never nice coming to Anfield and hearing that crowd \u2013 I\u2019ve been on the other end of it and it is not easy. \u201cThe fans play a massive part. I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like that. Coming into the stadium for a game which was not a final it almost set it up to be like a final. It definitely got us going and you could see that. If you are the away team and the crowd gets going like that it is horrible. \u201cCity are an amazing football team but they are only human and you put anyone in a pressure environment in an atmosphere like that maybe it can disturb them. I wouldn\u2019t say to the extent it did that because they still played some good stuff and dominated the ball but it definitely played a part in the first half. It got us going and it would probably shake anyone up so you have to give fans credit for that.\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain ranked his long-range strike past Ederson among the finest goals of his career but surprisingly, given his contribution in central midfield, admitted he was dissatisfied with his overall performance. The 24-year-old said: \u201cThe manager has been pushing me all season and shouting at me for not taking the game by the scruff of the neck and providing those kinds of moments, being the one shooting and making the difference. Slowly it is starting to pay off and it helps me to create moments like that. \u201cIt definitely shows why I wanted to come here and I want to keep improving. My game I wasn\u2019t too happy with. I could have been better on the ball so I was a bit disappointed with that and there are areas I need to improve on and can improve on. \u201cThere were a few runs I did in the first half where I broke the line and it was just the last man I didn\u2019t manage to get past or didn\u2019t get the shot off and it is those moments where I could have had a second goal or set someone up that I can work on. But I was really happy for the team and tried to work as hard as I can to help the boys to defend.\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain insisted there was no prospect of complacency creeping into Liverpool\u2019s performance in the second leg. He also claimed J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team were ideally suited to the Champions League and the latter stages in particular. \u201cWe definitely have qualities that are suited to this competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe further you go the better the teams you play against and you don\u2019t get many opportunities so you have to be clinical. The three boys up front this season have stood out in how clinical they have been. Going forward they are always a threat on the break and that is good for us because there will be times like against City when we don\u2019t see a lot of the ball and when we can break that is when we can hurt teams. You\u2019ve seen teams go far in this competition doing that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
