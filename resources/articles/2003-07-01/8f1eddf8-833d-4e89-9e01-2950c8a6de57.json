Mullins, 84, had been telling anyone who would listen that Vintage Tipple was the best he had trained on the Flat since Hurry Harriet, another filly who finished third in the 1973 Irish Oaks before going on to win the Champion Stakes. But it was Aidan O'Brien's Yesterday who was backed down to 11-8 favouritism. Settled towards the rear, she could only stay on at one pace to finish fourth, as Frankie Dettori came with a powerful late run on Vintage Tipple to cut down the long-time leader L'Ancresse and win by a length. Casual Look, winner of the Vodafone Oaks at Epsom, stayed on to finish third, a further half-length adrift. Dettori had his mount tucked away in fifth place as L'Ancresse, stable companion of Yesterday, cut out the running at a strong pace. Most of the 11-strong field looked to be toiling just over two out with L'Ancresse still ahead and Casual Look giving chase, but Dettori had Vintage Tipple perfectly balanced and the pair swept ahead at the furlong pole. The winner was having only her second outing of the season, having suffered a hairline fracture of a cannon bone in April, but connections were quietly confident. \"She's a very good filly,\" said Mullins. \"She just had the one hold up, but she came through it well. If she stays lucky, the sky's the limit for her.\" Dettori admitted he was surprised at the ease of the victory. \"The further she went, the stronger she got,\" he said. \"When I turned round a furlong out I couldn't believe we would win so easily. A Classic is a Classic, and you have got to take your hat off to connections.\" Team O'Brien salvaged something from the day when two-year-old One Cool Cat landed the Dubai Duty Free Anglesey Stakes. The son of Storm Cat, a winner at York on his previous start, was backed as if defeat was out of the question and was returned at 1-3, having opened at 6-4 on. His supporters had a brief scare over a furlong out when it seemed as if the colt, who was cruising effortlessly in rear, might not get a clear run. But Mick Kinane only had to shake the reins inside the final furlong to account for Leicester Square easily by one and a half lengths. O'Brien clearly holds One Cool Cat in substantial regard, describing his charge as \"a stunner\". \"From the first day he went racing he has been exciting, a beautiful horse,\" he said. \"We might look at coming back for the Heinz 57 Stakes next month, but there are plenty of options.\" Mick Channon's filly, Mail The Desert, third behind Russian Rhythm in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, finished second to Martillo after attempting to make all the running in the Group Two Grosser Porsche Preis over a mile at Hoppegarten, Berlin, yesterday. Martillo, who had been third behind the Channon-trained Zafeen in the St James's Palace Stakes, drew clear for an impressive two and a half length victory. In a race that developed into a sprint, Special Kaldoun sprang a 119-10 surprise in the Group Three Prix Messidor at Deauville. Dominique Boeuf's mount was in position to take advantage and beat Tashkandi by a short neck. Domedriver, the hot favourite, was last but one with two furlongs to run and could only stay on into fifth, beaten about a length."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
