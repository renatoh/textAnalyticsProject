Textiles account for 10% of global carbon emissions. The industry is the world\u2019s second-biggest industrial polluter, behind oil. In Australia, an estimated 3m tonnes of textiles goes into landfill each year. The ability to recycle fabric is, say industry veterans Adrian Jones and Graham Ross, a \u201choly grail ... for the industry and the planet\u201d that will help close the loop between resource-intensive fabric production and fast-growing piles of textile waste. Jones and Ross have pioneered and trademarked \u2013 with input from the CSIRO and the Queensland University of Technology \u2013 a small-scale and environmentally friendly process that takes blended fabrics and reduces them to their raw components. \u201cWe often seem to care more about old plastic bottles than we care about our favourite T-shirts,\u201d Jones told Guardian Australia. The immediate benefit of fabric recycling is to divert increasing amounts of waste from landfill. Trends such as fast fashion and minimalism have the unintended consequences of increasing fabric waste. In Australia, 75% of people throw textiles away each year, a 2017 YouGov survey found; 30% tossed out more than 10 garments. \u201cThe nature of the fashion industry is you start out with the best fibre or the best fabric you and and make it into a garment,\u201d says Jones, who has worked in fashion for big retailers in the UK and Australia for 30 years. \u201cThere is such intrinsic value in the fibres. But the way we value them doesn\u2019t reflect that. The retail prices don\u2019t reflect that. In the industry now we spend half the year marking [the prices] down as quickly as we can\u201d Long-term, recycling can reduce the industry\u2019s reliance on resource-intensive production methods used to make new fabrics. Cotton requires vast quantities of water. Polyester is made from petroleum and takes up to 1,000 years to biodegrade. Ross, a former endurance athlete who launched a sustainable athletic clothing line, says major apparel companies now have a stake in ending those wasteful production practices. Companies such as Nike now make products from large quantities of recycled waste, while H&amp;M is increasing embracing recycled polyester. But while textile recycling is not itself new, studies show many existing large-scale processes provide negligible benefits and can be as environmentally harmful as the production of raw fabrics. It also remains uncommon. \u201cThere\u2019s no textile recycling industry in this country,\u201d Ross says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of waste going into landfill and trying to fill that gap. The fashion industry is starting to use more sustainable materials and recycled polyester is on a fast uptake.\u201d The process pioneered by their company, BlockTexx, is \u201cabout the size of a craft brewery\u201d and testing has show it to be efficient and sustainable. The company is in the process of seeking to establish its first facility in south-east Queensland, recycling about 10,000 tonnes a year. The focus will be on recycling commercial fabrics \u2013 old towels and bedsheets from hotels and hospitals, work uniforms and unwanted clothing not given to charities. The \u201cseparation of fabric technology\u201d turns cotton to cellulose and polyester to flake. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to go back into textiles, either,\u201d Ross said. \u201cA company might end up using its old uniforms for new office furniture. You\u2019re not using virgin resources.\u201d BlockTexx also plans to build a marketplace for recycled textiles. \u201cThe whole process is novel and unique,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe certainly see the fact we can scale this. We see this as being an international solution ... as being a model that can be expanded internationally. This is a global problem, if our technology works and can keep large scales of textiles out of landfill, then we\u2019ll look to scale it up as quickly as we can. \u201cIf it\u2019s ripped or torn or stained then you have to put that into your landfill. We can take those torn, stained and ripped clothes and process them back into a reusable resource.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
