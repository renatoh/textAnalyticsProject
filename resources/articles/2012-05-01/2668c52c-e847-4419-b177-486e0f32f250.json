Consigned to looking from the outside at the top three, he is at surprisingly long odds to crash a party that, by consensus, belongs to Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic, with Roger Federer their tormentor-in-chief. It is not a role the Scot likes. He wants parity. In reality the difference between Murray and the great triumvirate of modern tennis is small yet significant and late this afternoon on Court Suzanne Lenglen he strives to join them in the second round when he takes on the little-known Tatsuma Ito of Japan. It is matches such as these that quality players dread, especially in big tournaments. Federer, who ultimately coasted clear of the German Tobias Kamke in three sets on Monday, touched on the dilemma. \"They're never easy, these first rounds,\" the world No3 said. Well, actually, they should be. But the pressure is generated internally as much as from the other side of the net, because it is all about expectations. Murray barely knows Ito, having played doubles against him in Japan last year, and that is a threat in itself because unfamiliarity breeds not contempt but doubt. How good, really, is Ito? What if he delivers the performance of his life in the most important match of his career on the biggest stage he has graced? Of course the same thoughts are running through Ito's mind. He has not experienced anything remotely like the sustained pressure that almost weekly is Murray's lot, be it against the best players in his sport or those who survive on the fringes of it. What Ito can draw on is the polar opposite of Murray's situation: nobody expects him to win a set, let alone the match, so what has he possibly got to lose? In a halting interview of few words on Sunday evening he was happy to admit that, of course, a victory over Murray would make him \"rich and famous\" back in Japan. He might not have entirely believed the words represented reality but he knew too that he can play with the freedom of the underdog and, committed to attack, he might at least frighten his vaunted opponent. What they share is a teenage admiration of Andre Agassi. Murray has built his intimidating defensive game around the style that the great American employed so successfully \u2013 and, it transpires, so has Ito. That could result in a stalemate of defensive tennis, although it would be a major surprise if the Japanese player can match the quality of Murray's returns. More likely \u2013 indeed, probable \u2013 is that Murray will take a few games to work out Ito's hunger for such an attritional contest and then work methodically on his weaknesses. Murray is a master of probing holes in the armoury of his opponents. When they see their killer shots mysteriously barrelling back at them from ridiculous positions they start to wonder if they are worth their place on the same court. That is almost certainly what Ito will be asking himself three or four games into this match. For Murray defeat is unthinkable. To lose to Ito would not only wreck his tournament; it would put a giant hole in his entire season. He is already slightly on the back foot over back problems that have nagged at him since December; losing to someone so far down the food chain of his sport would deal a piercing blow to his confidence. It will not happen. Murray will win. He might struggle a little at first but by early evening he should be retreating to his apartment on the Champs Elys\u00e9es relieved and satisfied that he has not slipped up against a stranger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
