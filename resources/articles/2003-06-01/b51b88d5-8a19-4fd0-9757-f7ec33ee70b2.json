It's not just America's capital but also the spy epicentre of the world. The love-struck couple mouthing sweet nothings to each other in a quiet restaurant in Washington's upmarket Georgetown area are actually passing on state secrets. The sharp-suited businessman opening an umbrella is in fact an agent signalling that he's ready to drop some files. And, as for the giant pandas at Washington's National Zoo, well, they're probably undercover agents, too. All this chicanery and double-dealing soon starts to take hold on visitors to DC. Quite unconsciously I began to hum the theme tune to Mission Impossible and to notice coded messages everywhere. At breakfast, I saw secret rendezvous instructions inscribed in my corn beef hash: \"K Street, 4pm, come alone.\" Worse, my personality started to change. I began to watch what I said and kept away from the windows. Instinctively I would introduce myself surname first, James Bond-style. But most alarming of all, I found myself responding to questions in my best Sean Connery voice. \"Coffee, sir?\" \"Yesh, pleashe.\" There was an easy explanation for my newly found paranoia. I had taken an overdose of espionage; an organised tour of Washington DC that visits the city's historical spy sites and a look at the new spy museum. SpyDrive is an enthralling three-hour bus tour that covers all the locales where Washington-based spies lived, worked and operated. We saw the safe houses, the secret signal locations and clandestine meeting places that made the nation's capital the centre of secrets and spying during the cold war. There were - and always will be - more foreign spies in Washington DC than anywhere else in the world simply because it's here where the secrets are hidden. In Washington DC, all is not what it seems; innocuous-looking mailboxes and innocent houses often reveal darker secrets. I began to wonder if passing joggers were secret agents keeping tabs on us - and, of course, those weren't Walkmans they were listening to. In America's capital this acute sense of being watched never quite leaves you. The SpyDrive tour is led by two former FBI and KGB intelligence officers - wholly inconceivable bedfellows just a few years ago. But they're now best buddies and allies - especially as there are some new enemies to consider since the attacks of September 11. The US had slain the dragon of communism but now it had a nest of vipers to contend with. Throughout the tour I kept wondering whether, if the US had focused on these vipers a bit more, they might have prevented September 11. Retired KGB general Oleg Kalugin was head of Soviet operations in Washington while former FBI agent David Major recruited foreign intelligence officers and \"managed defectors\" - whatever that means. For ex-intelligence agents were both remarkably forthcoming and seemed to compete for the best anecdote to tell the assembled tourists on the bus. Many old stories were aired and there was much excited talk of agents being \"compromised\". However, both refuted the romanticised view of espionage and spying as portrayed by Hollywood. The true world of double agents was far murkier, they said. \"Believe me, there's nothing glamorous about espionage,\" says David Major. \"All you see is the dark and seamy side of human nature. You see tragedies everywhere.\" We stopped at Chadwick's restaurant, a friendly bar and grill on K Street. It was here, on June 13 1985, that CIA double agent Aldrich Ames handed over reams of secret documents to his Russian minders in exchange for cash. It looks just like a normal diner but ex-agent David Major describes the restaurant as \"an espionage epicentre\". \"I know of no place where more damage was done to human lives and western intelligence than at Chadwick's on that afternoon.\" \"None of us here knew who Aldrich Ames was,\" recalls Chadwick's manager, Matt O'Hara. \"We didn't know he was even in here until it was exposed in the whole investigation.\" As a result of Ames' secret meetings here, David Major estimates that at least 10 agents were executed between 1985 and 1988. \"Many were tricked back to Moscow, investigated and put on trial.\" Some top restaurants in Georgetown also feature on the tour - firm proof that spies often put fine cuisine before loyalty to their country. A restaurant called Au Pied de Cochin was a popular meeting place for spies - it was here that double agent Vitaly Yurchenko had a final meal with his CIA contacts before he defected back to the USSR. In Washington DC, even the most ordinary-looking street corner is probably imbued with espionage. The faintest chalk mark on the pavement becomes a suspected information drop zone. However, this turns out to be true on the corner of 37th and R Street in Georgetown. Here, an ordinary blue mailbox was an operational signal site used by Aldrich Ames to tell his Soviet handlers that he was ready to pass on classified documents. \"A chalk mark looks innocuous unless you know exactly what it means,\" says Oleg Kalugin. Intelligence officers are always trying to find new ways to communicate between the officer and the agent. Spies have used the internet but that always leaves an electronic signature. Many favour tried-and-tested methods like chalk marks, not because they are more romantic, but because they actually work. A tour of Washington's foreign embassies included a real spying monolith, the former Soviet embassy on 16th Street, and now the Russian ambassador's house. According to Kalugin, at the height of the cold war, two-thirds of embassy staff were intelligence officers. The remaining third doubled as informers. My newly heightened sense of paranoia rocketed even higher with a visit to Washington's International Spy Museum, which explores the history of espionage and trickery - from the ancient Trojan Horse right up to American spy Robert Hanssen, exposed only a few years ago. It reveals the master deceptions and intelligence operations that changed the course of history. The museum, which opened last July, is located in the same downtown building that once housed the headquarters of the US communist party - and conveniently just down the road from the FBI offices. Who says Americans don't understand irony? During construction workmen uncovered a hammer and sickle carved into the wall. James Bond fans will love the espionage artefacts and groovy gadgets in the museum's 600-piece collection of spy memorabilia. Look out for the deadly KGB lipstick tube that, when twisted, fires a single bullet - a kiss of death indeed. There are secret cameras, a microphone wristwatch, a stun gun shaped like a fountain pen and a charming selection of fake warts and eyeballs that were used to conceal classified information. At the end of the tour I took David Major aside and secretively asked him what made a good spy. As a youngster I had once tried to bug my brother's bedroom and, as a freelance writer, I was used to trawling through rubbish bins. And hey, I'm sure I still had a trench coat someplace. What were my chances? For once he remained tight-lipped. Instead, he reeled off a cold list of \"qualities\" that included a short-term employment background, money problems and poor self-management. It also helped if you were disgruntled with your current employers. Crikey, it was like he had just read my CV. There might be an opening here. I thanked him, took his business card, and said farewell - for now. Way to go \u00b7 A Washington SpyDrive Tour costs \u00a338.
