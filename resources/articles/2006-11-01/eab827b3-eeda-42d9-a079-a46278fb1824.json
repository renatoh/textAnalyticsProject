Or might there be a magic bullet - or bullets - to get rid of it? Last week we explained here how increasingly sophisticated malware is being used to take over millions of PCs to create botnets, which turn infected PCs into self-contained email (SMTP) servers which can pump out a huge volume of spam; the amount has shot up in the past few months. Readers and web observers reacted with a range of responses from queries and suggestions about the best way to stop spam, to complaints about the damage already being done to innocent net users by antispam measures. To begin: Jonathan Duckworth from Stroud and Mark Tweedie in Coventry suggested that best way to be sure one is not part of a botnet is to use either Apple's OS X or the Linux operating system. While that might be true, it doesn't solve the problem of receiving huge amounts of spam; there are still millions of potentially exploitable Windows PCs worldwide. The proposals from readers on how to stop spam at its source boil down to six (largely independent) basic ideas, which I discussed with Lindsay Marshall, senior lecturer at the school of computing science at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, who is an expert on spam and computer risks. Use the X.400 message protocol The first two suggestions came from John Wallace, of Birmingham: \"Spam is technically sortable, and relatively easily (no need for everyone to ditch Windows just yet), but sorting it would put the anti-spam businesses out of business as well as the spammers and the realtime black-hole list maintainers would lose their ego trips, so where's the motivation for that to happen? \"My two quick suggestions. Option 1: X.400 - mail technology from the 1980s, ignored today because it pre-dates the internerd era, but designed from the ground up to have security built in (the military still use it where it matters). \"X.400 needs a bigger email client and mail server than POP/SMTP stuff, because X.400 is a mail system that inherently knows how to handle authentication, certification and lots of other good stuff that the POP/SMTP world doesn't. X.400 can of course interoperate with POP/SMTP but you lose many of the advantages if POP/SMTP is still in the picture.\" Lindsay Marshall's reponse: hollow laughter. \"X.400 is dead. The problem is that even if it can do that, you aren't going to change the world tomorrow. If we were all using it, that might be realistic. But you can't make everybody use it.\" Use 'authenticated SMTP' email Wallace continues: \"Option 2, the less emotionally uncomfortable one: widespread use of authenticated SMTP, which would for most users (and ISPs?) be a trivial change to their existing setup.\" This requires anyone connecting to an email server to send mail to give a username and password, which will be validated by the server before mail can be sent. Marshalll says: \"It would work, except how would any arbitrary person get in touch with you? Their mail server has to talk to your mail server. How do you know if their server uses authentication? You don't. It could work if every server has an ID, but that requires things like key distribution, which is very complex. \"It's a bit like challenge-response systems, where if you try to contact someone the first time you get a message back saying 'click this link to confirm you're real', and you often think 'Oh, I can't be bothered'. It's interesting nobody mentioned this as a solution. Perhaps they don't get any email?\" ISPs block other port 25 mail This is the suggestion being made inside the industry and adopted by Australia's largest ISP, Telstra, and by some ISPs in Britain. It blocks any outgoing emails that do not go via the ISP's email server - including, in theory, those emanating from bot-infected PCs acting as independent mail servers. However, two readers were suffering from the results of this \"solution\". First, Philip Parker of Carnoustie: \"I can't use my university's mail servers to send emails. My ISP, Orange, forces all outgoing mail on port 25 through its own mail server: you have to use your Orange login details to send emails through it. Due to this, I'm not able to connect to my university's SMTP [outgoing mail] server while at home. \"I can bypass it, being a somewhat tech-savvy student, by utilising a Virtual Private Network (VPN) - but that's complicating the issue.I need to send emails through my university's SMTP server because it rejects emails sent with my university address to others at the university that did not originate from its own server.\" Then, Andrew Williams in Frankfurt: \"Blocking port 25 traffic is a bad idea. Email services such as Hotmail or Yahoo have a webmail interface, but also allow customers to read and send their mail using a mail program rather than the html interface. \"If some ISP started blocking port 25 access and I were no longer able to send my mails via my email program, I would first put in a strongly worded protest and then start looking for a new ISP if they did not stop immediately.\" Marshall says: \"Actually, blocking port 25 inside ISPs is quite a good idea. It wouldn't solve everything, because there's a lot of spam that comes out of bad networks - I've never seen an email that wasn't spam come out of one Italian ISP, for instance. But you can use a VPN or web access to send emails otherwise.\" Other mail services, including Secure POP - used by Google's Gmail service - and the synchronising IMAP service, use other ports. Limit emails per day Williams continues: \"Several mail providers impose an upper limit as to how many mails you can send in a certain period of time. Think 100 mails a day or something like that. That should help a bit.\" Marshall asks: \"But what number? Should it be 10? I send more than 10 daily. 100? It's going to be different for every person. Getting the right number would be impossible. And whatever number you chose, the botnets could just throttle back the number of emails that they send so that they won't be detected. Botnets are the real issue here, and they won't be beaten if there are only a few messages being allowed.\" Write a worm that kills botnets Michael Russell suggested: \"Perhaps it's time for the IT security industry to bite the bullet and secretly design and deliver their own worm or Trojan that will hunt out &amp; clean up spambots? \"Yes, lots of hand-wringing over that idea - but this could be one of those occasions when the forced administration of medicine is just what the millions of patients really need.\" Marhsall notes: \"A company called Blue Security did try something like this: it would leave complaints on the spammers' websites. Blue Security got wiped off the net by an unknown attacker. \"The trouble is that it's impractical because it would involve the security industry talking to each other. And you'd also have the problem of the anti-anti-anti-anti-missile: you'd get worms that stopped the worm ...\" Adopt IPv6 The next-generation version of internet addressing would have an inbuilt system that could record where emails had come from, and from which machine. That should provide a measure of authentication. Marshall's reaction \"I don't know a lot about IPv6. I don't particularly care which technology underlies the net - it could be carrier pigeons as long as the data gets through. You can adopt IPv6 piecemeal, so that's something good to say. But it's the same problem as authenticated SMTP: you have to get everybody to take it up. Almost all problems are amenable to solution where everybody does the same thing. But the reality is that there are still people running Windows 95; the internet is not a closed, tidy community. It's diverse. \"So IPv6 is a good idea, apart from anything else, because we will run out of internet addresses otherwise. But we can't do that tomorrow, and I worry that we might be overrun by spam by then.\" Many companies have adopted various measures to combat spam. But that does lead to collateral damage. Thus: \"Increasingly organisations are installing powerful spam filters which are blocking my legitimate emails because the adult dictionary objects to my surname. \"In the past few months this has caused me a lot of problems and, as a result, I changed my email address to remove my surname from it but the spam filters still object to my surname in the body of the email. \"Usually when one of my emails is blocked it falls into a black hole and I am not aware that it has been blocked until I phone the recipient to ask if he/she has received my message.\" The writer, from Brighton: John Loveridge. Sometimes spam filtering is too sensitive for anybody's good. So what's the answer? \"I don't have any solution,\" says Marshall. \"Except for getting people not to reply to it. If nobody replied to spam, it wouldn't be worth their while. \"The trouble is, some people are stupid and they do reply. I wish they didn't!\" \u00b7 What's littering your inbox Spam has mutated in the past couple of years; in fact, by watching what is being offered, you can monitor what spammers believe - or have discovered - are the principal concerns of net users. Stocks \"Pump and dump\" scams, hyped by spam containing just a small image of the text (and so very hard to filter), remain effective and widespread. A study in August found that people who respond by buying hyped stocks lose, on average, 8% of their investment in just two days. Most hyped stock is also bound by US regulations forbidding its resale for a year - by which time its price will surely have cratered. Pharmaceuticals and lately diet pills remain hugely popular. But are you seriously going to trust your credit card details to a site that spams you? And are you really sure the contents of those pills are what they're claimed to be? A study last year found that two-thirds of \"diet pills\" sold online were counterfeit. Pornography Self-explanatory, and seasonal. But again, are you really going to trust your credit card or personal details to a site which has carefully selected you by spamming 100m people? Phishing Disguising the true sender of an email is simple: you just lie to the mail server about the \"From:\" address. Hiding a URL is easy too: you encode it in a hyperlink. Thus millions of emails pretending to be from eBay, PayPal and scores of banks worldwide are sent every day. And people still click on them and believe they are ensuring their security. Fake research Had an email saying you could win something if you just fill in a few questions? Of course you have. Just looking at the email validates your address. The solution? Delete them all.
