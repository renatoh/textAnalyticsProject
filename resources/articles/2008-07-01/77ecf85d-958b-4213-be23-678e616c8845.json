In contrast to the part-Mongolian singer Sa Dingding, Hanggai present a more traditional image of their homeland. They use a dash of electronica and electric guitar, but for the most part rely on the ancient horsehair fiddle, the two-stringed lute and growled \"overtone vocals\" (a traditional throat-singing technique in which a vocalist sings two notes an octave apart, at the same time). Led by Ilchi, a former punk, their melodic, often mournful songs at times echo the sturdy charm of Celtic balladry. RD"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
