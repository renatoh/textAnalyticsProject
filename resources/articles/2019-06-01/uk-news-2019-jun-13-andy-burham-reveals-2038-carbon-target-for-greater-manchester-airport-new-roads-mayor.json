But Burnham was quickly accused of peddling \u201cempty rhetoric\u201d because of the regional authorities\u2019 majority stake in Manchester airport, which aims to double passenger numbers over the next 20 years, and plans to spend \u00a36bn on new roads. While Burnham said he wanted Manchester to be the \u201cgreenest city region in the UK\u201d, Pete Abel of Manchester Friends of the Earth said the current plan would blow \u201cour carbon-budget twice over, putting us on a path to climate chaos\u201d. Abel welcomed Greater Manchester signing up to the 2038 carbon-neutral plan and for setting a science-based carbon budget, but said: \u201cWe need to urgently pull the plug on plans that will increase climate-wrecking emissions. Unless Greater Manchester stops planning to build more roads and double passengers flying from Manchester airport, then the climate plan will just look like empty rhetoric.\u201d Burnham said it was not hypocritical to make his pledge despite Greater Manchester councils owning 65% of the airport and air travel being a major producer of carbon emissions. \u201cAviation is a national and international issue, it\u2019s not something that a region can influence,\u201d he added. The mayor, who has frequently called for more powers at a local level, aid any attempts to cut air travel should be made byWestminster. \u201cI am all in favour of tough decisions at a national level. I don\u2019t believe there should be a third runway at Heathrow, for instance. But I think those are decisions for national government,\u201d he said. Manchester airport wants to increase passenger numbers from more than 25 million to 45 million by 2040, but Burnham insisted that growth could come from other UK airports. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily calling for more flights to the UK \u2013 it might mean taking passengers from other places,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a debate to be had about aviation isn\u2019t there? There are changing public attitudes about aviation. Rather than just saying no to people flying, don\u2019t we need to accelerate research into low and zero carbon forms of aviation?\u201d Greater Manchester\u2019s new industrial strategy also talks about reducing car use to no more than half of all daily trips by 2040 \u2013 \u201cthis will mean finding ways to create a radical change in behaviour, with a million more trips each day using public transport, cycling and walking\u201d. Though Burnham has committed \u00a3160m for the development of Greater Manchester\u2019s \u201cbee network\u201d of safe routes to walk or cycle, almost \u00a36bn of road schemes are being mooted in the region, including \u00a35.4bn for an extension to the M60 and M62 near Bolton and \u00a3477m for a motorway link through the Goyt valley in Stockport. On Wednesday Manchester city council announced plans for a \u00a39.1m revamp of Great Ancoats Street, a key commuter route just outside the city centre, which did not include any provision for cyclists. The council signed up last year to a manifesto proposed by Chris Boardman, the Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist who is Greater Manchester\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner. The manifesto promises to \u201censure all upcoming public realm and infrastructure investments, alongside all related policy programmes, have walking and cycling integrated at the development stage\u201d. Sir Richard Leese, the longstanding leader of the city council, said the Great Ancoats Street redesign aimed to \u201ctake traffic out of the city centre\u201d and included multiple pedestrian crossings. A new cycling route would run parallel to it on quieter roads, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
