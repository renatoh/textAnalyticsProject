Margaliyot sits directly below the flightpath of most Katuysha rockets that are fired into Israel. The war is happening over their heads. Most of the villagers have left for central Israel but those who remain have to endure the flypast several times a day. Each rocket sets off a sonic boom, followed by a rush of air as it travels through the air, then comes the impact. If it lands near enough, buildings shake. The rockets are fired from Lebanon at targets in the eastern section of northern Israel. The sonic booms are jarring, like field guns being fired from next door. On Wednesday afternoon, more than 100 passed over the village, most of them within an hour. They resumed yesterday at 2.30am and noon. The closest target is Kiryat Shmona, in the valley below. Simie Gavrieli, 48, has not left the shelter she shares with 11 others for 10 days. Inside the concrete room, children sit listlessly or squabble on mattresses that cover the floor. \"This is driving us all crazy,\" she said. On Wednesday the Thai embassy sent coaches to pick up about 100 workers who are vital to the village's fruit and poultry farming. Around the village, apples, pears and apricots have ripened and are too mature to sell. In the chicken sheds, there are thousands of undelivered trays of eggs and thousands more uncollected eggs. Margaliyot was founded in 1952 and almost all its residents come from the Kurdish areas of Iran. It has two Israeli military bunkers above it and has been targeted by Palestinian factions and Hizbullah since its foundation, although no one from the village has been killed. Yossi Sarid, a former education minister and part-time resident of Margaliyot, has grown used to living under the watchful eyes of the Hizbullah border guards just up the hill. \"I used to make coffee in the morning and they would look at me and I would look at them. Sometimes we would have a shouted conversation. \"I don't think they are any different from the people here. They want to work and they love their children. But the problem is their leaders.\" Mr Sarid is known in Israeli politics for rejecting violent solutions, but he admits: \"The bottom line for us is that Hizbullah should not remain on the border above us. It is the best recipe for the next round of bloodshed.\" As evening draws in, Israeli military activity picks up, with the boom and bang of helicopters and rockets. In Margaliyot, no one knows what is going on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
