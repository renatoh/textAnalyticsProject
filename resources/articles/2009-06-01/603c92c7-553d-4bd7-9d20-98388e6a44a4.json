It came in last year, when Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott (remember him?) played together at Torrey Pines; it has gone this year at Bethpage. No doubt the crowd-control stewards, contemplating what is bound to be a rowdy week on Long Island, are happy. Paul Casey, on the other hand, seemed slightly miffed, as if denied a prize that he had earned. \"I thought they would go with the same pairings as last year, with the three top guys together. It would have been quite exciting,'' conceded the new world No3. There are consolations aplenty, however, not least that he will avoid the pandemonium that would have accompanied Woods and Mickelson. There is no obvious benefit that comes with being the gooseberry in that particular three-ball beyond the momentary sense of achievement at having scaled the heights. Casey hardly needs that, at least not this week. It has been 39 long years since Tony Jacklin won the US Open at Hazeltine. There have been close calls over the years \u2013 Colin Montgomerie, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam all might have won at various times \u2013 and dashed hopes \u2013 none of them did \u2013 but in recent times no one has come into this event carrying such a burden of expectation. Casey, who has won three times this year and finished second in the World Match Play, has arrived at Bethpage as the man in form. He is also a man whose long-hitting, pure-striking brand of golf might have been tailored for the course. He played a practice round here last week, accompanied by his coach and mentor, Peter Kostis. \"One of the finest golf courses I have ever played \u2013 very, very, very impressive,'' he announced yesterday, an assessment that might have been more indicative of the fact that Bethpage suits him perfectly than an accurate assessment of the true stature of the golf course. The consensus is that while Bethpage provides a strong test of golf it is not particularly memorable or especially scenic \u2013 a good course, but not a great one. Still, Casey is not the first golfer in the world to invoke the power of positive thinking, especially when the stakes are this high. \"I think it would be fairly significant,'' he said of the prospect of becoming the first British winner of this tournament since Jacklin in 1970. \"The Open Championship is obviously the one that's closest to my heart because it's my home major, my home championship, but the US Open is second on my list. \"I think the Masters has always been the one which I felt I had the best opportunity to win. This would be the one that maybe I've struggled at the most. So as a personal sort of victory, I think it would be, sort of almost seen as a greater achievement because I haven't played particularly well. And to do something that hasn't been achieved in 39 years would be massive. So I would love to try and achieve that.\" Yet if the mood is exultant in camp Casey, then it must surely be tinged with just a little trepidation. It has been a long time since any home player has approached a US Open with such high hopes, but it is the first time that Casey has come to a major championship as the focus of attention. Admittedly, he attracts a sliver of the attention heaped on Andy Murray, another British athlete who has climbed to world No3 in his sport, but there is still a difference between a successful, wealthy Ryder Cup player and the man who is ranked just below Tiger and Phil. Celebrity beckons? \"I don't like that word. I'm an athlete. I'm a golfer. I'm happy with that word. I'm a sportsman, not a celebrity,\" he insisted. \"I feel like I have a little more pressure because I feel I have more responsibility now, maybe being watched a bit more. \"There was a kid in the restaurant last night who spotted us at the table next door. He claims that I'm his favourite golfer in the Tiger Woods video game, which he may have said just because I was sitting there. But it's a situation where people have been sort of spotting me a bit more. So it's my responsibility to make sure I'm doing the right thing, especially for kids and people who are looking at me as a role model.\" There is a flip-side to such adulation, however, and it has come in the scepticism that has greeted the Englishman's elevation up the world rankings. \"He is a good player but I can't believe he is No3 in the world,'' one unnamed American player carped the other day. Casey shrugged. \"I'm surprised I'm No3 in the world, but that's the way the system works. I don't make the system, so I'm not one who comes up with how the world rankings are devised. I've got three wins this year and a second-place finish, and I've accumulated a lot of points,'' he said. \"Who else has won three times around the world this year?\" The answer is no one, not even the great Tiger Woods; not that such details are likely to silence the naysayers. Perhaps a victory for the Englishman on Sunday afternoon will do the trick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
