The reason was the decision by the mayor, Oleg Zontov, to move for a vote over the application of a law that had only just been passed by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. This \u201claw on the condemnation of communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes\u201d, voted through by parliament on 9 April, prohibits all defence of Nazism and communism. The sale of communist souvenirs, and even the singing of the Internationale, is now banned in Ukraine. Individual offenders risk up to five years in prison. Members of organisations risk up to 10. The legislators were seemingly not worried about the risk of deepening the cultural abyss between western Ukraine and the Russophone east of the country, a centre of Soviet industrialisation between 1930 and 1950, and a place where nostalgia is ever present. In Sloviansk, the mayor belongs to the Poroshenko bloc and he decided to apply the new law in his own way, targeting the statue of Lenin that enjoys pride of place opposite city hall. The national law has not yet taken effect, but debates are already under way over changing communist-era names of Ukrainian cities. Dnipropetrovsk, for instance, (named after the celebrated revolutionary Grigory Petrovsky) could be quickly retitled. At the Sloviansk council meeting of 29 April, a vote on the \u201cdismantling of the monument to Lenin, situated in October Revolution Square\u201d was added to the order of business. But \u201cthe meeting was suspended and the vote postponed,\u201d explained Edouard Torskiy, a journalist with Delovoy Slavyansk, when \u201cmilitant communists barged in on the meeting, threatening a return of separatist forces if the councillors targeted Soviet symbols\u201d. Last year this city was seized by pro-Russian separatists led by Igor Girkin, a former Russian army officer who also goes by the name of Strelkov (Shooter). For a time it became the epicentre of the fighting between pro-Russia rebels and pro-Kiev forces. Strelkov briefly became minister of defence for the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk, taking numerous hostages, including journalists and observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The city changed hands again in June 2014 after fierce bombardment. But tensions are still high, in both the city and among its politicians, because the pro-Kiev mayor is in a minority on the council. The elected officials are more or less the same as before. The majority belong to the Party of the Regions, the organisation headed by former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country after the Maidan revolution, and the Communist party. The next local elections will take place in October. Towards the end of last April, the giant Lenin statue had already been vandalised, covered in pink paint and adorned with a Ukrainian flag as a scarf. Around its base, placards explained \u201chow to spot a separatist\u201d, offering tips on recognising signs of separatism in one\u2019s neighbours. To begin with, local nationalists appeared to leave it to the councillors to decide the fate of the statue \u2013 though since the beginning of the war, and well before the \u201cde-communisation\u201d law was passed, more than 100 statues of Lenin have been demolished, many in the middle of the night. On 27 May a new council meeting was scheduled and Zontov placed the statue on the order of business again. All of Sloviansk\u2019s nationalist groups attended to express support for its removal, with nationalist parties Svoboda and Right Sector turning out en masse. The number of nationalist militants has boomed since the war began, even though the number of MPs from these two groups only went up to seven out of 450 at the general election last October. In Sloviansk the nationalists have long been frustrated at their lack of representation on the council. At the meeting the nationalists\u2019 constant interruptions led to a scuffle before the issue of the statue had even been broached. However, after temporarily halting proceedings, the mayor was able to start the debate. \u201cI am responsible for the political life of our city,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many different points of view in our council. To find compromises, we have to talk with each other and take a decision today.\u201d Zontov proposed that, rather than being destroyed, the statue should be sold at auction or placed in a museum. As he spoke, nationalists in combat dress took position close to the council members. Then a man shouted from the public area: \u201cI have in my hand a letter signed by 4,000 residents. People are against the destruction of the statue because it\u2019s part of their history, part of their youth. You should listen to the opinions of your fellow citizens.\u201d The ensuing row deepened the divide between the younger generation, which looks towards Europe, and their often nostalgic elders, who lived under the USSR. The self-declared \u201cpatriots\u201d shouted: \u201cShame on you! Glory to Ukraine. Glory to our heroes!\u201d Then a young nationalist militant told the assembly: \u201cIt was Lenin who began the process of destruction of Ukraine. He brought the famine to Ukraine from 1922, then he launched a violent collectivisation. He created an ideology that killed millions of people.\u201d Another young man berated the councillors: \u201cYou are \u2018provocateurs\u2019. We are the descendants of people assassinated by that man. We are going to make that statue disappear. Now you are going to decide whether it\u2019s destroyed or whether it\u2019s removed. That is the choice we give you.\u201d The uproar resumed with loud shouts of \u201cseparatists\u201d filling the hall, followed by cries of \u201cShame on you\u201d. Zontov brought the meeting to an early close, but shouted above the clamour: \u201cWe have six months to resolve this question. Come to the next meeting.\u201d In the hall afterwards, militants flourished a placard calling for \u201cSloviansk without Lenin.\u201d Tamara, an opposition member, left the assembly assailed by insults from the young nationalist militants, but didn\u2019t seem too bothered. \u201cOur mayor doesn\u2019t do anything for this city. He only offers suggestions for destruction,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has found 50 people to support his plan. We have collected 4,500 signatures against the destruction of the statue. Even if Lenin wasn\u2019t a good human being, he was part of our history and you don\u2019t wipe out history like that.\u201d But in the end the debate was settled by the minority. In the early hours of 3 June, militants from Right Sector tore the statue down.
