The bank's total compensation bill reached $16.5bn, up 40% on the previous year. The increase was largely due to a higher bonus pool. Goldman's bankers will learn the size of their bonuses later this week - as will rivals at Morgan Stanley - and kick-start a spending spree likely to reverberate in the property and luxury goods markets. The results will further burnish Goldman Sachs' reputation. The bank was again ranked number one this year in advising on mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings. The investment banking division posted revenues of $5.6bn, more than the previous record set at the peak of the market in 2000 when companies were rushing to buy internet and technology assets. Fixed income, commodities and currency trading reported revenues 60% higher at $14.3bn. Group revenues were $37.7bn. Chief financial officer, David Viniar, said it had been \"a remarkable year for Goldman Sachs by any standard\". During the year, chairman and chief executive Henry Paulson left the bank to become the US treasury secretary; the latest in a long line of Goldman alumni taking illustrious roles in public life, including former BBC boss Gavyn Davis and the New York Stock Exchange chief executive John Thain. Mr Paulson was replaced by Lloyd Blankfein. This was the third year in succession that Goldman, known on Wall Street simply as \"the firm\" has produced record earnings. Despite the growth in compensation, the bank said the figure as a percentage of total revenues, had actually fallen. The ratio of compensation and benefits to revenue was 43.7%, down from 46.6%. Goldman wants to show Wall Street it can keep a lid on costs. During the year, the bank expanded headcount by 12%, taking its workforce to 26,500, some 5,000 of whom are based in London. The bank does not reveal how much it pays in bonuses. Shares in the bank slipped amid concerns Goldman will not maintain momentum. \"Everybody is jittery about the future growth of this company,\" said David Stepherson, a portfolio manager at Baltimore-based Hardesty Capital Management. But Mr Viniar said the bank's backlog of deals on which it is advising, was higher than it had been at the end of 2005. \"We are seeing steady growth in economies and if they continue to grow, our business should do pretty well,\" he said. Mr Viniar also shrugged off the suggestion that Goldman risks alienating clients by its increasing proprietary investments and trading. During the summer, Mr Paulson told executives in its private equity business to back off after they became involved in a series of failed hostile bids, including ITV and Britain's second largest pub company, Mitchells &amp; Butlers. \"That question has been asked for years,\" Mr Viniar said. \"Our business is a very client focused business. We do take proprietary risk as well, but most of our trading revenues come from client focused trading.\" One area that did not fare as well was the Goldman Alpha hedge fund, which is down 10% on the year. Mr Viniar said the volatile performance of the fund would not put the bank off expanding its alternative investments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
