Outside the rain pours down, and there is the sound of cars whooshing past in the puddles. Inside, the 33-year-old is bracing himself for a backlash over a controversial chapter in his autobiography, published this week, and has already received several phone calls from upset players and their agents. \"You Don't Know Me, But... A Footballer's Life\" written by Carlisle himself during his final season as a professional footballer with Aidy Boothroyd's Northampton Town is a beautifully crafted, honest and insightful autobiography. Its 280 pages, however, may end up being reduced to a single word: shithouses. There is a lengthy silence as Carlisle absorbs this thought. Incredibly, despite his role as PFA chairman, Carlisle used the term to label a group of high profile black players \u2013 including Rio and Anton Ferdinand \u2013 who decided not to wear Kick It Out T-shirts last year in protest at a perceived lack of action from the organisation following incidents of racist abuse from John Terry and Luis Su\u00e1rez. So what exactly does the former Countdown contestant, who has twice appeared on Question Time, mean by that word? \"Erm. I suppose it basically means 'cowardly',\" Carlisle says quietly, reflecting how he came under pressure from all sides to speak out as chairman, while many of the protesting players remained silent. \"The Premier League 'big' players will happily throw in a grenade by not wearing a T-shirt,\" he wrote in the book, \"but when it explodes they won't do anything, appearing to hide behind their advisers.\" \"And that was how I felt at the time,\" he says now. \"I felt that players, I felt that the guys did something that was very public but then weren't willing to actually step forward and be accountable for what they did and state the reasons why.\" So does Carlisle still think those players are \"shithouses\"? Carlisle sniffs and a long silence ensues. Fifty five seconds later he finally answers the question. \"I still feel that there's a real reluctance from players to step out on issues, yes,\" he says. \"I don't think that they're all shithouses.\" He pauses. \"It's a very, very strong word isn't it. But I was very, very angry at the time. I think players should have more courage to stand up for what they believe and if they feel strongly about something they should speak out and have the courage to do that.\" Did he express these views to the Ferdinands at the time? \"I didn't say it to them personally, to their faces, but I made it clear in the interviews and in the meetings and in passing on information that [their actions] needed to be explained. I made that clear, and I stated it publicly. There's nothing for me to, I don't think, I don't feel guilty about writing that part. Not at all.\" Carlisle is at great pains to point out that the book takes a diary-like form and in a later chapter he subsequently \"pays credit\" to those same players having better understood their views. Nevertheless, emotions are running high. While the Kick It Out chairman, Herman Ouseley, says he \"broadly welcomes\" Carlisle's sentiments, Reading's Jason Roberts has accused the former Burnley player of misrepresenting the truth in an attempt to sell books. \"It's inflammatory writing, it's emotional writing,\" concedes Carlisle. \"I think anybody would be offended if they were called cowardly.\" Still, he will not change the wording for the paperback edition. \"No adjustment. It is what it is.\" However you look at it, labelling a group of players \"cowardly\" for not speaking on the issue of racism after at least one of them has already been racially abused \u2013 and in the case of Anton Ferdinand also received a bullet and death threat in the post \u2013 seems a bizarre attack. Carlisle sighs. \"I didn't call them shithouses for being victims of racial abuse, and I didn't call Rio and Anton individually two shithouses. I said I was angry and frustrated at the players who didn't wear the T-shirts, of which there were many, not just Rio and Anton.\" In a year that included the Reginald D Hunter episode, the black comedian hired to perform at the PFA's awards night who delivered a routine based around the word \"nigger\" damned by Carlisle as a \"disaster\", and most recently tabloid revelations over the PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor's alleged gambling habits, Carlisle admits that he worried most about the passages relating to his role as PFA chairman \u2013 despite the book being vetted by the union's lawyers. He reiterates his support for Taylor, but said: \"It's a difficult one as Gordon's not actually come out and made a personal statement as yet.\" You cannot help but wonder what the 68-year-old makes of this latest brouhaha. Carlisle's father's verdict on the book probably sums it up best. \"Son it's brutally honest\", he said. \"I said, 'It is, Dad, because that's the way that I want to be.'\" Having kept secret his own suicide attempt and problems with alcohol and depression for many years, Carlisle describes the book \u2013 and the excellent BBC documentary on football and suicide which preceded it \u2013 as intensely \"cathartic\". His stark and moving confession in recalling the day he swallowed 56 co-proxamol tablets washed down with a Carling in a London park as a 21-year-old battling a career threatening injury opened the floodgates to \"thousands of emails\", many from footballers young and old who had faced similar problems in the game. The problem, Carlisle says, is that football is so sanitised. When Carlisle suffered his most recent bout of depression, Boothroyd told the press that he had been sent home with flu. The former defender understands. \"Can you imagine if he'd said I'd been sent home with depression? It would have been a breaking news banner on Sky Sports News,\" he laughs. But the apparent need to protect a player, team and club from such media intrusion demonstrates the habitual concealing of the truth. \"The image of the modern player is manufactured,\" he nods. \"I'm a human being and that's all I wanted to show \u2026 an honest account of what football's like. Instead of all the rubbish that people see. People see filtered characters. They see masked characters and attitudes and opinions. I wanted to be genuine.\" Carlisle admits he's \"nervous as hell\" about the reaction to his book. \"Opinion divides,\" he says, noting how football clubs and celebrity advisors attempt to stifle players into being bland. \"As a player you conform because you don't want to rock the boat, you don't want to get on the manager's bad side because it could be seen to be undermining or betraying his confidence or his trust. It shouldn't affect your career to have an opinion on most issues, but there is a perception that it might. So why take that risk?\" He laughs. \"Good job I've retired. \"Some will take umbrage with my opinions [in the book]. I'll get some stick for it no doubt. It's started already. But it's all right. It's my book. And I'm really proud that I've written it.\" He drops his voice suddenly. \"Football's just a game,\" he says. \"It's a very rich game. It's a very well-rewarded, well-supported, well-followed game. But it's just a game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
