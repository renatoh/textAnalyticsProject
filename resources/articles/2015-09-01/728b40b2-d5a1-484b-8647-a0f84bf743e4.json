Stones was the subject of three bids from Chelsea in the last window and submitted a transfer request in the hope of sealing a \u00a330m move to the Premier League champions, only for Everton to reject all approaches. Mart\u00ednez insists Chelsea\u2019s pursuit came at the wrong time for Everton and Stones, who will confront his suitors on Saturday when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side visit a hostile Goodison Park, and that the 21-year-old will remain an integral part of a young team aiming for Champions League qualification. However, the Everton manager said there are circumstances when he would consider selling a key player. The defender will have three years remaining on his current contract at the end of this season, although he is expected to be offered an improvement to his \u00a335,000-a-week deal following the Chelsea transfer saga. Mart\u00ednez, who insisted from the start of Chelsea\u2019s pursuit that Stones would not be sold, said: \u201cAll that matters from my point of view, since the day I arrived, is that we have a long-term ambition and we are trying to assemble a squad. There are right times and wrong times to lose players and at this moment John Stones is paramount in everything we do. \u201cSince the first day he was on the bench, in the squad ahead of senior centre-halves and then playing ahead of senior figures, it has been very important for us to have John. I truly feel for his development and for his career Everton is the perfect place for him to be. All I am interested in is what Everton needs in this campaign. From that point on we will need to make another decision on what we need to be better going into next season. It goes project to project.\u201d Asked if that meant he accepted Stones could be sold next summer, the Everton manager replied: \u201cAt the moment you are not making a decision only to delay it for another window. You don\u2019t do that. You make a decision based on what do we need now, can you replace a player now, can we get a stronger squad by losing a player now? \u201cThe decision, clearly, is that John is in a perfect position to be important for how we want to play now. We have very young players ready to kick on like Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku and John Stones. It was about keeping that core. You go from window to window and you say: \u2018Will we finish as a stronger squad?\u2019 You assess. Players have moments of form, you look at their ages.\u201d Mart\u00ednez issued a blunt response to allegations that Everton were guilty of double-standards in refusing to sell Stones to Chelsea having bought the player for \u00a33m from Barnsley. \u201cWe bought John Stones because he was for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn Stones is not for sale at Everton. End of story.\u201d He claimed the young defender has the potential to become the best centre-half to emerge from England. \u201cI\u2019m going to be biased but I see John Stones as potentially the best centre-back that England has ever produced. I\u2019m saying potentially because he\u2019s still a young man and until he\u2019s played 400, 500 games you can\u2019t make an assessment of what he\u2019s done. \u201cBut he\u2019s incredible on the ball \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen another English player who\u2019s got the ability to start play in that manner \u2013 he can be left one v one, he\u2019s very good in the air, he reads the game fantastically well and he\u2019s got a terrific ability to adapt to different partners. As a player, the character reflects what he is: very calm, very composed and his potential is unique.\u201d That prompted a question as to whether Stones\u2019 next step should be Barcelona or Real Madrid rather than Stamford Bridge, to which Mart\u00ednez responded: \u201cIt\u2019s Everton in the Champions League. That\u2019s his next step.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
