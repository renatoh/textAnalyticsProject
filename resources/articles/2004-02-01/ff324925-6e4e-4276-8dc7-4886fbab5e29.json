The CLA claims the current planning laws are hindering housing development in the countryside because they are based on policies best suited to towns and cities. The CLA is an organisation that seeks to protect and develop its 40,000 members' interest - who collectively own more than half of the agricultural land in England and Wales - as well as providing 38% of all private rented housing in rural areas. The authors wrote that the national housing debate is obscuring the needs of smaller housing settlements in the countryside, because it views rural housing development as a solution to the urban housing market, rather than recognising that the country has intrinsic housing needs of its own. Rural communities do not want \"disproportionately-sized estates grafted onto the edges of villages\", and prefer \"smaller, well designed housing developments\", according to the report. This means that rather than the existing planning policy framework identifying one site in an area for development, smaller projects across several areas would be preferable, to make use of redundant farm buildings and unused agricultural land. The government must recognise rural landowners' role in delivering affordable housing in the countryside, the report states. \"As land uses in the countryside change and as the number of agricultural buildings needed to support farming declines, CLA members find themselves with building that are costly to maintain but which could serve a new use for business or residential purposes to meet those changing needs,\" the report states. This would involve extending the powers surrounding exception sites, which currently allow social housing developers to build affordable housing where it is most needed, even if the land is not earmarked for development. The government has threatened to axe the exception site ruling under the existing housing bill, but the CLA wants the powers transferred to private landowners for small-scale developments. The CLA president, Mark Hudson, said private landowners should be given rights to build a small amount of private properties on exception sites, in exchange for building a similar number of affordable homes for part-purchase or rent. This would stop villages being overwhelmed with large amounts of new dwellings and provide \"organic, incremental\" growth for communities, he said. \"Housing associations are not interested in building very small numbers of properties in small villages,\" Mr Hudson said. \"That is why are calling for a change to planning guidance which would allow a lot more flexibility for relatively small developments in villages. \"It is a social conscience thing. We are all responsible for ensuring that the areas we live in have a cross-section of people.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
