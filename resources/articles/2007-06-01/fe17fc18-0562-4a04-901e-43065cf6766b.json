The former England captain's name was given the most rousing cheer of all when it was read out before this 1-1 draw against Brazil. The 32-year-old then repaid the committed public support with what was a man-of-the-match performance in the nation's first return to Wembley since 2000. \"It was a historic night,\" he said. \"I don't know whether the reception before the kick off was louder than when I came off. But it's always nice to have the support of the fans like that.\" Beckham played like a man reborn, though his career appeared to be heading in an unstoppable downward spiral fewer than six months ago when his Real Madrid coach, Fabio Capello, vowed never to pick him again. Yet despite the freshness to his game it was his familiar dead-ball deliveries that devastated Brazil. Only when Beckham's 68th-minute free-kick fell on John Terry's head did the captain score his first goal since August. \"It was a great ball from Becks and it was about time I scored again,\" said Terry. \"We had quite a lot of possession; we couldn't get through the middle of them and we tried to move it wide. We did that a bit better in the second half.\" That meant Beckham saw the lion's share of the Three Lions' possession and seldom did he squander it. He played with the determination of a player who had been so publicly sacrificed, having been dropped entirely from Steve McClaren's first selection when he might have been retained as a useful squad member. Beckham admitted the experience had caused him to doubt whether his international career had halted forever on 94 caps. \"I'm not sure I knew if I would ever get this moment again but I'm just happy to have been a part of a historic night,\" Beckham reiterated. \"I felt relaxed all week and it's just nice to be back with the team.\" The former Manchester United midfielder was the totem of Sven-Goran Eriksson's England but despite his position of fresh perspective on McClaren's side, he feels that there is no discernible difference between the two eras. That is perhaps to be expected, since McClaren went back on his big break from the past in bringing back Beckham. Significantly, he was received well by his team-mates both on and off the pitch, though in the past the England squad's only genuine celebrity - one whose international-duty hotel suite would once be furnished with a mobile tanning salon - has been accused of being a distraction. \"The feeling among the squad is no different and I'm not looking at what's happened in the past,\" he said, insisting that the media attention has been no burden. \"I've had that for the last 10 years and it's been good this week. I've enjoyed it.\" Nevertheless the pressure is on. England have stumbled through their European Championship qualification campaign without him and a material benefit must be drawn from last night's creditable result during the trip to Estonia next week. Beckham, however, will not insist on playing. \"The most important thing in Estonia is that we need three points,\" said Beckham. \"We've got a great bunch of lads; they're free-spirited and I'm sure we'll be all right.\" Beckham's response to the experience of being a discarded Gal\u00e1ctico has been typical of his desire to prove critics wrong. \"I always felt I had to play for my place, not just this week,\" he said, before expanding enough to suggest that he has little time for those at Real who have rested on reputations alone. \"I've always believed in any team whoever you are and whatever your name is, you've still got to fight for your place. I've always done that with every team I've played for.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
