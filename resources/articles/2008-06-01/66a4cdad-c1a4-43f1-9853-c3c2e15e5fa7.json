But if last weekend's big events are anything to go by, this year's online festival coverage isn't going to be nearly as much fun. In 2007, Virgin Radio's website, virginradio.co.uk, carried extensive highlights of all the main acts at the Isle of Wight festival. This year, their coverage was limited to pictures, blogs and a series of less-than-thrilling interviews with the acts. Sure, you can watch three hour-long Isle of Wight highlights shows at ITV's website (itv.com/Entertainment/Music/isleofwight/), but you can't pick and choose who you'd like to see, which means, for instance, you'll have to sit through the Kooks and Scouting for Girls before you can check out the Police. And you don't want that. Meanwhile, last year's Download festival encouraged its hard-rockin' punters to upload their own videos of the event to downloadfestival.tv. This year, they didn't plug that site and no new videos were posted to it. There are various video blogs from the festival at downloadfestival.co.uk, bbc.co.uk/radio1 and youtube.com/nmetv, but it's all festival fluff and no live action. It's the same with Xfm's coverage of Beach Break Live (xfm.co.uk/festivals) - you can hear chat from acts including the Wombats, but no music. Perhaps promoters are concerned that people won't go if they can experience festivals online. The only festival that did come up trumps with performances last weekend was Bonnaroo - America's answer to Glastonbury - which offered high-quality live webcasts of acts including Sigur Ros and the Raconteurs on AT&amp;T's Blue Room site (attblueroom.com). They're promising to add highlights of the action soon; until then, their coverage of both Coachella and the New Orleans Jazz festival is well worth a look. When Mariachi-tinged alt country heroes Calexico play Germany's Southside and Hurricane festivals this weekend, they'll be forgiven for crowing to the other bands that their track Crystal Frontier was used by Nasa to wake the astronauts throughout this month's successful space shuttle mission. To celebrate, Calexico are offering the song as a free download from touchand gorecords.com/media/185.mp3. Apparently the track was chosen by the shuttle commander's wife, who presumably judged that its perky trumpets would provide a suitably energetic alarm call. Either that, or she was trying to spook her space travelling spouse with the song's rather unsettling couplet: \"Blood spills out on the streets/ and bodies are missing for weeks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
