Although they were part of the group that had discussions about the prospect, the Premier League remains the priority. \u201cArsenal aren\u2019t or never have been interested in playing in any competition that weakens the Premier League,\u201d the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, said. \u201cThe Premier League is the world\u2019s leading league in the leading sport; we don\u2019t want to do anything to damage it. I see these articles that Arsenal want to break away \u2013 we never want to do any of that. But we also have to recognise we have to be in these conversations or we wouldn\u2019t be responsible. We have to be in the conversations \u2013 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we support them.\u201d Venkatesham\u2019s colleague Ra\u00fal Sanlleh\u00ed, the director of football who joined from Barcelona, emphasised that Arsenal wanted to position themselves in the highest echelons of the game and therefore feel compelled to be part of any debate, but he suggested that the manoeuvring between the top clubs that make up the European Club Association (ECA) is as much to do with posturing to push for the best possible deals with Uefa as any clear push to form a Super League. \u201cAs [it is] responsible for top European clubs the ECA had to look to all the options for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them, of course, could have been the possibility of a European Super League. We had a working team that participated \u2013 I was at Barcelona at that time, Ivan Gazidis [then of Arsenal] was there too. It was a conversation we didn\u2019t hide from anybody, not even from the ECA smaller clubs. \u201cWe knew that could be an option and we explored that option. We looked into that in two ways: a way of exploring the real possibility and also how it would help us to negotiate with Uefa under the new terms because every cycle we will negotiate. At the end of the day the outcome was the best possible because we got into a new deal with Uefa within the system that protected the domestic leagues.\u201d Sanlleh\u00ed rejected reports that there was a genuine proposal recently that Arsenal signed up for. \u201cThe way it was explained may seem we were doing secret things but there is nothing secret,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is one document that has been presented in an article that has Arsenal\u2019s name; it also has Barcelona\u2019s name. But there\u2019s no signature and I can assure you in Arsenal and Barcelona we have not seen the document. It\u2019s a draft, probably drafted by some proposal discussed with one of those clubs in that list that I don\u2019t know about. It\u2019s a real document \u2013 I cannot deny that \u2013 but I can assure I\u2019ve not seen that document.\u201d He is doubtful a European Super League is around the corner: \u201cNot in the short term because we have an agreement with Uefa right now \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what the future will bring because the future writes itself. I don\u2019t envision, not in the short term or medium term, radical change.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
