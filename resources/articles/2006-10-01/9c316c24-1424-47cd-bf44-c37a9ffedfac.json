Small things are significant. \"Somebody told me (who?) that both Waugh and TS Eliot lost the will to live when they had their teeth extracted and were presented with a set of snappers.\" The sentence is characteristic both of the protagonist of William Boyd's Any Human Heart, and of the novel's form, even down to that musing incompleteness - \"(who?)\". Fictional and historical, private and public, mortality and absurdity jar against each other. These are the incongruities in which this novel delights. Did the two great writers really have false teeth, you wonder? But then the narrator has told you that he cannot even remember his source. Any Human Heart is Mountstuart's private journal from the 1920s to the 90s. The novel's subtitle, \"The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart\", recalls the French notion of the journal intime (appropriately, as Mountstuart is a francophile, who spends part of his life in Paris and his last years in rural France). The genre is most associated with Andr\u00e9 Gide, whose shockingly candid journal covered most of his adult life. Yet he was not the first: the Journal Intime of philosopher Henri Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Amiel, covering more than 30 years of his life, became famous in the 19th century. Like all good examples of the genre, it was published posthumously. Any Human Heart likewise gives us its protagonist's intimate life, from the conclusion of the very first entry in his \"School Journal\". \"In the dormitory that night I pleasured myself with delectable visions of Lucy. No 127 of the term.\" (The affected diction - \"pleasured\" - and proud counting are deliciously typical of the self-important teenage narrator.) Years later, the middle- aged Mountstuart, recently a widower, returns to the habit. \"What sick Victorian cleric dubbed the practice self-abuse? Self-help, more like, self-support, self-solace.\" \"I should record this for curiosity's sake,\" he adds, noting that \"the image in his mind\" is a receptionist briefly encountered in a Reykjavik hotel. \"Funny, these sensual fingerprints left on your imagination\". \"I should record this ... I must write this down ...\": thus are observations frequently introduced. The novel mimics the self-inspection of the true \"intimate\" journal. \"What an unaccountable thing is the mind of man!\" exclaims James Boswell in his journal when he recalls the sexual fantasies he enjoyed in the midst of a church service. As with Boswell, there is plenty of sex, but the conventions of the fictional journal require it to be sex recalled in bemused or reflective tranquillity. \"Now that I have had a true and mature sexual encounter ...\" ruminates the 21-year-old Mountstuart, absurdly. Lust or its absence are recorded with frequent puzzlement. \"Was it because half my mind was elsewhere?\" he asks, as he notes his surprising sexual stamina in bed with his third wife, just before the marriage collapses. The journal allows the narrator to grow older. Conventional first-person confessional narrative, patented by Daniel Defoe and used in Boyd's own earlier novel The New Confessions (1987), looks back from some wiser vantage point. Here, however, the novel presents us with its leading character at different stages of his life. Boyd makes this feasible by splitting the novel into nine imaginary volumes - the School Journal, the Oxford Journal, and so on - with gaps in between. Each has its different voice: the affected languor of the undergraduate, the quotation-filled sententiousness of the young author, the seen-it-all name-dropping of the middle-aged art dealer. Getting a slightly different texture for each of these is the novel's stylistic achievement. The journal writer is always catching himself writing. (\"Rather a good sentence,\" says the young Mountstuart to himself.) The self-consciousness that is inherent in the form provides for much of the novel's comedy, and its eventually surprising poignancy. Disbelief at each age is vividly marked. \"Le trenti\u00e8me de mon \u00e2ge,\" the narrator notes in 1936, as if only French could catch the melancholy of it. \"Fifty-eight. Good God,\" he mutters in 1964. \"Health fair. No more teeth out. Haven't had a Dexedrine for months\". The last third of the novel gathers a certain pace from its memento mori. \"I fear it will become a documentation of one writer's decline,\" comments the narrator as he recommences his journal in old age. The disadvantage of the journal form is its plotlessness. The narrator cannot see the overall shape of his own story. At one point the novel tantalises us with a far-fetched plot. Mysteriously betrayed on a wartime mission, he wonders whether it has something to do with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (the former Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson), with whom Mountstuart has fallen out earlier in the novel. \"I'll never forget the Duchess's words: we still have powerful friends.\" Is this entertaining paranoia, or a key to the narrative? There is no way of knowing. \u00b7 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London. His How Novels Work is published by OUP.
