It positively sloshes through this endearing seventh LP from Tennessee\u2019s Miranda Lambert. She whiles nights away in Dark Bars, finds nothing works like Tequila Does, and on the extremely droll Way Too Pretty for Prison, a duet with Maren Morris, the pair ponder murderin\u2019 a cheatin\u2019 man but decide against it because \u201cthey don\u2019t have rhinestone ball and chains / lunch trays don\u2019t come with chardonnay\u201d. You can\u2019t blame her for hitting the wine: since her last solo LP she\u2019s been through two high-profile relationships and then married for a second time. For better and worse, these joys and trials aren\u2019t always met head on. Some more specificity to her lyrics might have been affecting, but the broad metaphors she couches her life lessons in are entertaining, such as the laundry/love stains of It All Comes Out in the Wash. And if her melodies are occasionally leaden, as on Fire Escape and the decidedly earthbound gospel of Holy Water, for the most part the backings are robust and varied. There\u2019s high-speed rockabilly on Locomotive, Shania-style pop-rock on Mess With My Head \u2013 \u201cYou treat my mind like a hotel room / And I know why I gave the keys to you\u201d is a typically pithy line \u2013 and Bluebird, Track Record and How Dare You Love are all touched with the cosmic airiness that made Kacey Musgraves\u2019 Golden Hour such a pleasure last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
