One of the first fruits of that sabbatical arrived at the Proms on Wednesday, courtesy of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and its music director, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, to whom the score of Foreign Bodies is dedicated. It's an ambitious piece (20 minutes long, employing a massive orchestra) and a surprising one. Over the past 10 years Salonen has been purging his music of its elements of radical complexity. Like his outstanding Finnish contemporaries Lindberg and Saariaho, he has opted for linear, melodic ideas and much clearer harmonic movement. He spent much of that decade in Los Angeles, where he is in charge of the LA Philharmonic, and that translocation was the starting point for Foreign Bodies. It also encouraged this new style, which places more emphasis on the physicality of the sound than on elaborate thematic processes. The gestures are bold and direct, the scoring hugely imaginative and virtuosic. The result sometimes sounds like a curious hybrid of Sibelius in the terracing of the textures and their remorseless accumulations, and John Adams in the dauntless rhythmic energy - Finland and the West Coast synthesised. Saraste and his orchestra delivered it confidently. The programme continued with seven songs from Mahler's Das Knaben Wunderhorn collection, shared between the mezzo Katarina Karneus (intense and rapt) and the baritone Dietrich Henschel (not so finely focused dramatically). Then it moved, almost inevitably, to Sibelius. The sixth and seventh symphonies were carved from the same creative block in the 1920s. Yet though they are compellingly complementary (the sixth is expansive yet mysterious, the seventh compressed yet affirmative) they are rarely heard together. The Finnish RSO has this music in every fibre of its collective body, and Saraste moulded the spare textures of the sixth and built the seventh to a noble climax, even if his readings did not always have as much inner toughness as they could have done. \u0095 The concert will be broadcast again on Radio 3 on Monday.
