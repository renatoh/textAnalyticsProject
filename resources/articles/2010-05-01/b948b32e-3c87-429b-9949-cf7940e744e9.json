Police said \"several youths\" were arrested after the victim, who has not been named, was fatally stabbed at around 6.15pm. The boy was found injured when police were called in after reports of a disturbance. He was taken to hospital by paramedics, but pronounced dead shortly after arrival. Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"A murder inquiry is under way after a death in Sydenham. Police were called at 6.15pm regarding a disturbance \u2013 believed to be in Home Park recreation ground, bounded by Winchfield Road and Sydenham Road. \"Officers attended and found a 16-year-old boy who had been stabbed \u2026 We must retain an open mind at this early stage regarding the circumstances of the incident and any motive. A number of male youths were arrested in the vicinity and are now in custody.\" The boy is the 10th teenager to be murdered in London this year \u2013 and the seventh in less than six weeks. Seven of the teenage murder victims have been fatally stabbed. Last month, two teenagers died from knifings. Aspiring journalist Aliza Mirza, 18, from Ilford, who was taking A-level media studies at school, was stabbed in the neck outside Manor Park railway station in east London on her way to a party. Wesley Sterling, 16, was fatally stabbed at a birthday party at Croydon Sports Arena in south London. A record number of 29 teenagers were murdered in London in 2008, topping the previous worst toll of 27 in 2007. However, there was a steep decline in the number of teenage murders in the capital in 2009. The Home Office has pledged \u00a35m on high-profile schemes to cut knife crime. But charities have warned that this year government funds for their workshops with young people are drying up and that they are having to abandon the projects because they cannot obtain cash from elsewhere. They have criticised the government for what they say is its belief that short-term funding will provide a \"quick fix\" for major social problems, such as knife crime. One project, to which the Home Office awarded \u00a3100,000 last year for a 12-month period, has had to end despite much praise from Oxford University. The scheme, run by the Rathbone charity, has tried to deter 196 teenagers, aged 13 to 19, from carrying and using knives. Many of the young people are addicted to drugs or alcohol, have been excluded from school, or are offenders or former offenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
