The next is closer. Small-arms fire crackles through the air. On a nearby ridge American Special Forces run in a crouch from their fox hole, their desert camouflage oddly out of place against the lush, green grass of the fields. Two distant percussive thuds, like a car door being slammed, sound from across the river and two more shells barrel overhead with a low growl. Then the growl cuts out abruptly, there is a short silence and then impact, closer now, the other side of the earthen bunker that was once the front line. When we, and the peshmerga, raise our heads, oily smoke is dark against the clear blue Iraqi sky. The sky is criss-crossed with vapour trails from the American jets that circle above us, waiting to be called in. They are the 'airborne artillery', as the Special Forces on the ground call them: F-14 jets, a B-1 bomber, huge, lumbering B-52s, millions of pounds of cutting-edge military avionics delivering state-of-the-art munitions. But on the ground it is men such as Zahel Kader Kataw who are doing the fighting. Wearing black trainers and surplus fatigues bought in the local bazaar, carrying a 20-year-old AK-47 with a single magazine, Kataw has advanced about eight miles in the last three days and has had to battle for every yard. This is the northern front. Here there are no armoured columns racing across the desert, no convoys of supply stretching from horizon to horizon and no huge camps of hardware ringed with barbed wire. There are few grand strategic objectives like Baghdad airport. Here men are fighting to look once more on their birthplaces or reclaim ancestral family land. It is a scrappy, vicious, chaotic war, fought by men with hatred or contempt for their enemies and a willingness to use any weapon at hand. 'It is a real fight,' Zahel Kader Kataw, 37, said as he relaxed in the sun after an attack. 'Now Saddam has a big problem. We are coming to get him.' There have been clashes all week along the 140-mile confrontation line between Kurdish and Iraqi forces. In Khifri in the east, close to the Iranian border and only 90 miles from Baghdad, Kurdish peshmerga fighters swept forward after US air strikes had dislodged Iraqi regular army units from a series of forts. The peshmerga were fighting for the villages where they had grown up and which had been left under Baghdad's control after the 1991 Gulf war. Many of the villages had been left in ruins by Saddam's campaigns against the Kurds in the late 1980s. 'I want to force these animals off my land and rebuild my home,' said Salam Rasul Qadir, 49. Reports from behind Iraqi lines indicated Qadir's few hectares might already be vacant. Entire villages, cleared of Kurds and populated by ethnic Arabs on the orders of Saddam Hussein, are emptying. Arab refugees are streaming away from the front line. The Iraqi troops had shelled the outskirts of Khifri before having to pull back. Saman Hassan, a 23-year-old taxi driver, was one of three civilians killed by the bombardment. He had been sent by his parents to look for two younger brothers. They turned up safe. Saman did not. A young girl was also killed. South of the eastern city of Sulay maniyah, clashes continued last night between peshmerga forces and Iraqi troops consolidating a new line of defences around the strategic oil-rich city of Kirkuk. British and US teams of special forces have been establishing themselves around the perimeter of the city and operating far behind Iraqi lines, searching out targets for air strikes and securing bridges and oil installations. The area is mined and booby-trapped. Retreating Iraqis have placed anti-tank mines under the asphalt of roads and clusters of anti-personnel devices in the verges. None is marked and the Kurdish mine-clearance teams comprise part-time soldiers equipped with sticks. In the middle of one mined section of road between Kirkuk and Sulaymaniyah a boot, with a human foot still inside, was visible. It was a mine that claimed the life of a BBC cameraman last week. The fighting has been heaviest in the no-man's-land between the central northern city of Arbil, the de facto capital of the autonomous zone run by the Kurds for the last 12 years, and the city of Mosul. The combat has been rushed, scattered and confused, with attacks, counter-attacks, frantic fire-fights, ambushes and hasty retreats both night and day. The road between Arbil and Mosul crosses 50 miles of rolling pastures, split by two rivers. The bridge over the first fell to the Kurds without a fight after the B-52s had pounded the Iraqi positions defending it a week ago. But the battle for the second, at the village of Khazer, has been continuing for the last three days. Yesterday, despite being forced into retreat, peshmerga were confident about its eventual outcome. 'First we take Khazer, then the next village, then the next, and then the British and Amer icans can go to Mosul and Baghdad,' said Kataw. The Iraqi resistance has been unexpected. Kurds had begun pushing on Thursday morning. Initially only 40 Kurdish fighters, with just two American Special Forces soldiers, moved forward. At first there was no opposition but then the Iraqis counter-attacked. Mortar fire raked the ridges above Khazer, forcing the peshmerga back and pinning down the Americans. Shells and missiles even fell on the road back to Arbil. A fierce firefight continued for over an hour as the pershmerga and US soldiers gave ground. Then air support ordered up from the stack of planes that circle northern Iraq waiting for targets was called in, and a series of air strikes blasted the Iraqi positions. Peshmerga, riding in old three-tonne trucks and battered pick-ups, rushed forward. The Iraqis, a mixed force of soldiers, Baath Party loyalists and fedayeen militia fell back into Khazer village, where they were bombarded through the night. 'We were in a bad place for a bit,' admitted one of the American soldiers after the battle. But he was scathing about the Iraqi tactics. 'It's amateur hour at the Apollo. They don't coordinate, they haven't blown the bridges, they just blaze away. I can't figure quite why but they do,' he told The Observer . Then he turned back to his radio. 'Fort Apache this is Egypt Tango, I have the coordinates for the new mortar position,' he said. At 8.30 on Friday morning the attack resumed. Again the Iraqis gave ground and then again they counter-attacked, using their 82mm mortars to disrupt the peshmerga advance as reinforcements, including tanks, rolled up from Mosul to give support. For a few hours, at dusk, the Iraqis were forced out of Khazer, leaving a Jeep and three blackened bodies smouldering beside the bridge. Dead dogs, their bodies broken by the blasts, lay in the road. Peshmerga, with tired eyes staring from soot-stained faces, sat against a wall. With the fighters came the looters. A car bounced past with an electric oven and hob protruding from the boot. Others carried away plastic barrels, blankets, car batteries. The same scene has been repeated all across the front. South of Sulaymaniyah, the first people into many of the abandoned Iraqi positions were local villagers in search of booty. Some fell victim to the ubiquitous mines. At Khifri, as the Iraqi troops fell back, looters on bicycles braved the continuing shellfire. Even the soldiers indulged themselves, though not for personal gain. At Khazer they captured an Iraqi Jeep, complete with a mounted heavy machine gun. They drove it away from the front, paused near the mortar positions, scratched their heads, then took the battered, back-firing vehicle back to the firing line to use against its former Iraqi owners. But such impromptu reinforcements count for little against Iraqi armour. By noon yesterday, yet another Iraqi counter-attack, this time with tanks, had forced the peshmerga to withdraw from Khazer, ceding control of the crucial bridge. Massive air strikes continued throughout the afternoon, both on Khazer and the defences further back towards Mosul. The strikes were powerful enough to shake windows in Arbil, 20 miles away. No one is under any illusions about the strategic significance of Khazer. It is a tiny village, barely featuring on most maps. Its only utility is its bridge. But the battle there has broader political implications, none the less. The Kurds have repeatedly stressed that they are not planning to take Mosul or Kirkuk themselves. To do so would enrage the Turks, who are concerned that the Kurds might try to declare independence if they controlled the cities. Ankara might then have an excuse to send troops into Kurdistan. Political leaders of both the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the two groups which govern the enclave in the north of Iraq, said last week that they had placed themselves under coalition command and they would not act unilaterally. 'This is not an easy choice for us to make. It runs counter to every impulse,' Barham Salah, the PUK's Prime Minister, told The Observer . Massoud Barzani, the KDP leader, expressed the same sentiment, although he criticised the Americans for not making greater use of local forces. Doing so, he said, would have saved them casualties. Special Forces officers in Iraq have praised the peshmerga. 'They are good fighting soldiers. They move faster than most regular armies,' said Major Tim Nye. But the Americans have only 2,000 lightly armed regular troops and around 1,000 Special Forces in northern Iraq. Though they can call in air strikes, thus providing the heavy firepower that can make good their lack of artillery or armour on the front, it is up to the peshmerga to do the bulk of the fighting and, everyone knows, most of the dying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
