The breakfast program has agreed to a court-enforcable undertaking to conduct an independent review of the program\u2019s production processes and retrain staff in dealing with sensitive and complex issues. Last year the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that Sunrise breached broadcasting standards for accuracy and provoked serious contempt on the basis of race when co-host Samantha Armytage and guests discussed the adoption of Indigenous children. Commentators Prue MacSween and Ben Davis made strong negative generalisations about Indigenous people as a group. The panel did not include any Indigenous person, made several factually wrong statements, and aired comments by MacSween that the stolen generations policy removed children for their own wellbeing and \u201cperhaps\u201d should happen again. \u201cThese included sweeping references to a \u2018generation\u2019 of young Indigenous children being abused,\u201d Acma said last year. \u201cWhile it may not have been Seven\u2019s intention, by implication the segment conveyed that children left in Indigenous families would be abused and neglected, in contrast to non-Indigenous families where they would be protected.\u201d Seven challenged the finding but in April it withdrew the application for judicial review. Acma said on Friday Sunrise has to order an external independent review of how the program is produced and a report of the review must be provided to Seven\u2019s board within six months. The media watchdog will verify the independence of, and terms of reference for, the review. The network has also agreed to train Sunrise editorial staff to identify and deal with sensitive matters, also within six months. Sunrise breached the Commercial TV Code of Practice in its Hot Topics segment broadcast in March 2018. \u201cIf Channel Seven breaches the court-enforceable undertaking, the Acma can apply to the federal court for a number of orders, including directing Channel Seven to comply with the undertaking, and any other order the court considers appropriate,\u201d Acma said. Seven\u2019s director of news and public affairs, Craig McPherson, blamed political correctness and censorship for the Acma decision last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
