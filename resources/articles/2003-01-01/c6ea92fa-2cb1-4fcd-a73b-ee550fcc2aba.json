BBC political correspondent John Pienaar and former Spandau Ballet front man Tony Hadley, who were due to be paired in BBC2's next celebrity boxing bout, have been asked to stop training. The BBC's move to halt its celebrity boxing specials comes after the British Boxing Board of Control denounced the charity events as dangerous and irresponsible. British Boxing Board officials also threatened to revoke the licences of four high-profile managers and trainers in a heated row over the latest round of celebrity boxing. Frank Maloney and his brother Eugene, top trainer Jim McDonell and Audley Harrison's promoter Jess Harding have been summoned to appear before the board on February 5. The row blew up after the fight between Grant Bovey and Ricky Gervais - which pulled in 5.5 million viewers - was screened just after Christmas. The boxing board denounced these charity events as dangerous unlicensed boxing and wrote to the BBC pleading with it to halt the match. Frank Bruno's former promoter Frank Warren also condemned the BBC, complaining they were making \"a farce of the noble art of boxing\". Chief among his concerns was the danger to the participants, who were given just six weeks training before they entered the ring. At times the Gervais v Bovey match descended into what looked more like a pub brawl than a boxing bout. \"It's a very dangerous sport and it needs to be regulated properly. You can't just go to the gym for six weeks and think you are a boxer. It takes a long time and a lot of dedication,\" said Warren at the time. \"The brain doesn't distinguish whether it's being hit by a professional or an amateur. If, heaven forbid, something should go wrong, people won't be saying 'let's ban The Office or whatever Grant Bovey does', they'll be calling for a ban on boxing,\" he added. \"It is with regret that without the backing of the boxing authorities we have asked our celebrities to stop training, and put plans for the remaining bouts on hold,\" a BBC spokeswoman said. \"Our record for safety and working with the best in business has been paramount throughout production of BBC2's The Fight. We are extremely proud of the programmes and our celebrity boxers' contributions to charity,\" she added. The decision to axe The Fight is understood to have been taken following a meeting between BBC2 controller Jane Root and the corporation's entertainment commissioning team. Bob Mortimer and Les Dennis were the first celebrity duo to enter the ring for the BBC, in August, for Sports Relief. A second edition of The Fight followed over Christmas, with Ricky Gervais coming out as an unlikely winner over Grant Bovey, Anthea Turner's husband. Up to seven celebrity bouts were being planned by the BBC, with Donal MacIntyre and Darren Day being tipped as potential future pugilists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
