Ronald Jordan, 62, known to publishers as the infamous White Van Man, ran a network of thieves throughout London and the south-east, stealing travel books to order. Jordan then sold the books from stalls in the City and at Waterloo. City of London Police described the case as \"a flashback to Victorian London\". Detectives began investigating this modern-day Fagin after suspicions were raised about his bookstall in Dominion Street. A lengthy operation resulted in the arrest of Jordan and others in July 2002. Officers uncovered 17,500 books worth an estimated \u00a3180,000 during searches of Jordan's premises. Maya Catansis of Lonely Planet said: \"This is an enormous relief for booksellers and publishers. It got to the point where some shops wanted to stock Lonely Planet behind the counters, like cigarettes. There was a lot of pressure put on us.\" Richard Trillo, marketing and publicity director of Rough Guides, said: \"We're delighted. He undermined our relationship with the booksellers. Worse, the public were buying old and stolen goods.\" Some bookstores, particularly at airports, were refusing to display the travel guides in a prominent position due to the constant thefts. Jordan's shoplifters routinely stole 40 to 50 books at a time. Jordan sold them from his Dominion Street stall in the afternoons, before setting up at Waterloo, where he would typically sell until midnight. He would sell on average 100 books a day, amounting to an estimated 35,000 books in one year. City Police officers arrested Jordan again in July last year, this time seizing 8,500 books. He was charged with handling stolen goods. At the end of a trial which ran for several weeks at Southwark Crown Court, the jury last week found Jordan guilty of conspiracy relating to the 2002 charge and of handling stolen goods in 2003. He will be sentenced in February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
