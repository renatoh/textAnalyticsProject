The i says simply: \u201cNo sign of life\u201d over the top of an image of the White Island volcano\u2019s eruption, as seen from the water. It says safety warnings were ignored for years at the country\u2019s most active volcano. The Guardian uses a similar image for its picture story, but the splash is Johnson\u2019s lack of sensitivity when shown the image of a boy lying on the floor of an A&amp;E department, and the subsequent claims of Conservative distraction tactics. The headline is \u201cTories accused of lying to distract from image of boy on hospital floor.\u201d The Mirror, which led on the A&amp;E story yesterday, continues the theme today, with a front-page picture of a baby lying in a hospital chair while awaiting treatment. \u201cHere\u2019s another picture you won\u2019t want to look at, Mr Johnson,\u201d is the headline. The Times says British tourists were injured in the New Zealand volcano eruption and squeezes in a single-column story on the PM saying replacing the BBC TV licence with a pay-to-watch subscription is a possibility. The Mail carries the same two stories for its front page, but swaps their positions around. The Express also focuses on the TV licence story, with a picture of the PM in a high-vis jacket and the headline: \u201cBoris threat to axe TV licence.\u201d The volcano image sits across the top. The Telegraph reports on a Tory party memo that says the chance of Jeremy Corbyn leading a coalition government have been \u201cseriously underestimated\u201d and that Labour could come to power without winning any extra seats. The picture slot is given to the eruption on the New Zealand island, whose M\u0101ori name is Whakaari. The Sun splashes on Alan Sugar\u2019s call for Labour voters to oust Corbyn, claiming it is the best way to save the party in the long term. \u201cYou\u2019re fired Corbyn,\u201d is the headline. The FT carries a picture of former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, who has died, and splashes on shares in Tullow slumping 70% after its forecast oil output was cut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
