Capital (BBC1), adapted from John Lanchester\u2019s novel, manages a lot. Petunia is at 84 (Pepys Road and about that in years, too), an old-school native who has been here for ever. The modern metropolitan world might confuse her a bit (Gemma Jones is so good at being old and confused) \u2013 Indians, Pakistanis, Hindus, Muslims, what is the difference? \u2013 but she\u2019s more accepting of it than her recently deceased husband. Ahmed, who\u2019s very good to Petunia, and his family, second generation Pakistani immigrants, run the corner shop. Roger, a banker, and his family, who don\u2019t know Petunia or Ahmed, are in the big double-fronted number 92, with the Range Rover outside. But then there\u2019s everything and everyone else that comes with them. So Petunia\u2019s grandson is a hoodied Banksy-style street artist, who may or may not have something to do with the postcards with \u201cWE WANT WHAT YOU HAVE\u201d written on them that keep coming through everyone\u2019s door. At the shop, Ahmed and his brothers, Shahid and Usman, have varying relationships with Islam, ranging from very casual to susceptible to fundamentalism. Mum appears at the dinner table, courtesy of Skype, from Pakistan. And at 92, it\u2019s not just Roger and his big-spending wife, Arabella, and their expensively schooled boys, Conrad and Joshua, but also the army of subsidiary personnel required to keep a family like that ticking over and help them spend their money \u2013 Spanish nannies, flirty eastern European builders to build wet rooms and then unbuild them when they go out of fashion, gardeners, etc. Then, in the street, visible to most only as an irritation, is the most recent arrival, Zimbabwean asylum seeker/illegal worker Quentina, slapping parking tickets on the cars. Go on, put another on the Range Rover, it\u2019s so big (especially next to the man who drives it; Roger is played \u2013 capitally \u2013 by Toby Jones). Meanwhile, the house prices flick up at a terrifying rate, like the numbers on a petrol pump in full flow. And, if we just rise up from the street and look in a north-easterly direction, there in the distance are the towers, the gherkins and cheese graters, of the City \u2013 mainly to thank/blame for the madness, as well as being where Roger scuttles off to each morning. So, obviously, that\u2019s not every single aspect of London, but Lanchester \u2013 and in turn Peter Bowker and Euros Lyn, who have adapted and directed so excellently \u2013 have managed to squeeze an incredible amount into one street, one book, and then further squeeze into three hours of television. A lot of the important stuff, as well as what is most wonderful and most terrible about the place. It\u2019s more complicated \u2013 and more interesting \u2013 than just wonderful and terrible. So Roger might be a banker (boo) and an idiot, but he\u2019s not an entirely unsympathetic character. I even felt a bit sorry for him when his bonus was only \u00a330,000. (\u201cWhat use is \u00a330,000 to anybody?\u201d) Arabella is the real monster, almost too much of one (\u201cNow where do you stand vis-a-vis cedar wood cladding?\u201d to Bogdan the builder). But even she has an ember of humanity and is touched by the generosity of Ahmed with coriander on her first-ever visit to her local shop. Most of the viewer\u2019s sympathy is directed towards Quentina, though. Who\u2019d have thought it \u2013 traffic warden love? It\u2019s all so instantly recognisable. I live in the capital, in a street from a similar era, though in a far less salubrious area (house prices, obviously still insane, but about a third of Pepys Road). We have pretty much that exact shop. And a few \u2013 fewer and fewer \u2013 Petunias. There aren\u2019t any bankers, or Range Rovers, or basement excavations, the City\u2019s actual physical shadow hasn\u2019t reached Dollis Hill yet, but the shadows of the shadows have, a couple of doctors moved in to where Jimmy (male Petunia, basically) lived, there\u2019s a lawyer or two, plus the odd nanny. Not to mention the bloody Guardian. The issues, the conversations, the obsessions and the fears are the same. It\u2019s not just a brilliant allegorical portrait of London. There are stories to tell, the postcards keep coming, then DVDs, someone really WANTS WHAT THEY HAVE. Probably everyone does (I\u2019m quite jealous of Arabella and Roger\u2019s kitchen, to be honest). There\u2019s some dodgy stuff going on in the bank, Petunia has a brain tumour and is dying, Arabella\u2019s off, a new nanny arrives (well, hello), Quentina\u2019s banged up and may be deported. We\u2019re heading for a crash, big bang, meltdown. Is it that kind of Capital, too: not just principal city and wealth, but also punishable by death? Because Pepys Road, its residents, London itself, has cancer \u2013 a tumour of greed, and mistrust, hatred and pointlessness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
