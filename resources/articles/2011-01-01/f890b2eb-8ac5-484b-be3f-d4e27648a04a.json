One might wonder why, if he were that hot, he hadn't thought to remove a layer earlier, but that would reckon without the aesthetic he and his wife, Alaina Moore, have constructed. The jumper stays on because without it Riley wouldn't look as if he'd walked straight out of an 80s preppy college movie, or as if he and Moore had spent eight months yachting up and down the Atlantic coastline of the States, during which, Tennis say, they wrote the songs played tonight. Musically, too, everything Tennis do is precisely calibrated. The instrumentation is sparse \u2013 Riley plays spindly guitar lines, Moore plays organ and sings; the drummer is never introduced \u2013 and the songs might have been written in the Brill Building 50 years ago. (Jackie DeShannon's When You Walk in the Room fits smoothly into the set.) It's so seamless and directed, in fact, that there's a real risk this meeting of lo-fi and girl group could founder on its own narrowness. That it doesn't is down to Moore's rich, warm voice, and the quality of the songs: the likes of Marathon, South Carolina and Baltimore have a direct and timeless appeal that is enhanced rather than diminished by the simplicity of the presentation. This cross of country-club style and indie-club music might not prove to be an enduring proposition, but there's enough substance behind the novelty to suggest Tennis might be one of this year's more charming success stories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
