When the 2001 Ryder Cup was postponed because of September 11 it was quickly decided the teams would stay the same for the matches in 2002. The vast majority are still happy with that decision, not least those members of both teams who gained their places in 2001 but who would have hardly a sniff of a chance of playing if a fresh team had been put together for 2002. There are arguably six in the European team who owe their place at the Belfry this week solely to their form of a year ago, and a similar number of Americans. That much is well known, not least to the players. The question now is, which team can find the permanent class to rise above the transience of form? To take the Europeans first, Pierre Fulke, Bernhard Langer, Paul McGinley, Jesper Parnevik, Phillip Price and Lee Westwood have all lost form and confidence since being named in the 2001 team. Not one has had a season in 2002 with which he can be pleased and all are reduced to relying on the old adage that anything can happen in an 18-hole match. Only Parnevik was a captain's pick by Sam Torrance, all the others being inside the top 10 of the Volvo order of merit at the cut-off date of September 2 2001 when they qualified. At the corresponding point of this season Fulke was 30th, Langer 39th, McGinley 47th, Price 40th and Westwood 75th. Langer was brilliant in 2001, with a host of fine finishes in top tournaments, but for others their slump has been more prolonged. Fulke, Price and Westwood would have been a worry even in September 2001. Fulke got in by winning the 2000 Volvo Masters and coming second in the 2001 Accenture Match Play in Melbourne. After that, in 2001, he played 13 events in Europe and missed the cut in six. Price is an accumulator, having won only twice in his 13 years on tour, both of them less hotly contested Portuguese Open titles. He had his best year by far in 2000 with four seconds, including to Tiger Woods in the NEC Invitational, but there were only four top-10 finishes in 2001. Westwood took four months off at the start of 2001 to be with his wife and their first child, Samuel Bevan. He has not been remotely the same golfer since, with only three top-10s in 2001. In 2000 he won six times in Europe alone. Who would be called up now, if it were either desirable or possible? The first surely would be Jose Maria Olazabal, a winner on the American tour this year, 11th in the order of merit on September 2 this year, currently the fifth highest-ranked European, and one of the greatest Ryder Cup players ever. Justin Rose has won four times this year, realising the talent that has been within him, to stand fifth in the order. He is brim-full of confidence, as is Paul Lawrie, the 1999 Open and 2002 Welsh Open champion, 16th in the order. Two others who would be likely types are both Swedes by the name of Hansen, Anders and Soren, no relation. Both are winners this summer, ranked 12th and 14th in the order. But if changes in the European standings have made something of a mockery of the original selections, the Americans are in just as poor a state. Some of their players have been close to invisible this season. Curtis Strange, the US captain, must know his team is a long way from being the best it could be. He would surely, secretly, like to see the back of Paul Azinger, Mark Calcavecchia, Stewart Cink, David Duval, Hal Sutton and Scott Verplank. Azinger and Verplank were his picks but both have slid so far down the money list as to be real worries. Azinger is 73rd, Verplank 44th. And Calcavecchia, Cink and Sutton have gone from top-10 to, respectively, 43rd, 76th and 142nd. Even so, they will all be playing this week, not Justin Leonard (currently fourth in the US qualifying points list), or Fred Funk (fifth) or Jerry Kelly (seventh). So both teams are left with half their personnel playing poorly. Does this affect the chances of one side more than the other? The suspicion is that Europe may well suffer from the inability of players to raise their games. Among the Americans out of form are four - Azinger, Calcavecchia, Duval and Sutton - who have won majors and know how to respond when the pressure is on. That could prove priceless this week - and potentially decisive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
