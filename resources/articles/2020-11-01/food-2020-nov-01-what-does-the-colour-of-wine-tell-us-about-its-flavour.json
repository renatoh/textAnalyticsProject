Generally speaking, there are enough clues in its appearance to give you a pretty good idea. In red wine, for example, an opaque, deep, dark purple will lead you to expect what you will, nine times of ten, get when you take a sip: a richly flavoured, thickly textured, highly alcoholic wine. The opposite \u2013 pale red, translucent \u2013 suggests elegance, freshness, lightness of flavour and alcohol. But it doesn\u2019t always work out that way. I\u2019ve been caught out a few times by wines made from the currently fashionable (after years in the wilderness) cinsault grape variety in South Africa, such as Morrisons\u2019 very attractive example: these are often attractively glassy and ruby-red in appearance; they may well have a red fruited cast to their flavours too, and a supple weightless drinkability. But they\u2019re not light as such, and at 14.5%, they have a hidden alcoholic power. La Gitana Manzanilla, Spain NV (\u00a311.99, Waitrose) A lot of the old preconceived notions about appearance in wine are changing, with the once rigidly policed divisions between red, ros\u00e9 and white seemingly dissolving. Many modern ros\u00e9s are so pale (and their flavours so light) they may as well be white. A number of the more interesting reds being made in the natural wine scene look more ros\u00e9 than red. And then there are orange wines \u2013 such as Rigal Vin Orange 2019 (\u00a310) a fun new addition at Morrisons from 25 November \u2013 which are really dry white wines, in that they\u2019re made from white grapes that have been left in contact with their skins for an extended period during the winemaking process, giving them the tannic bite of a red and their own cast of herby, spicy flavours. Finally, there\u2019s the lighter end of fortified wines: a glass of fino or manzanilla sherry, looks just like a straight dry white wine \u2013 and, frankly, with its salty-refreshing style, it works just as well washing down a plate of garlicky prawns. Tesco Finest Sauternes, Bordeaux, France 2015 (\u00a312, 37.5cl, Tesco) Although I should know by now that looks can be deceiving, the old expectations when it comes to wine are hard to break. Certainly the first time I tried an orange wine, I was pleasantly confounded by the flavours and textures in much the same way diners in restaurants of a molecular gastronomic bent are bewildered by that olive repurposed as a strawberry or hot ice cream or what have you. I was expecting sweetness, certainly, but also stone fruits, maybe some tropical flavours, and a viscous mouthfeel. Which was fair enough really given that up to that point all the wines I\u2019d tried with anything approaching the same tint would have been sweet wines. Even now, some hardwired part of me expects the range of flavours \u2013 marmalade, crystalised fruit, toffee, apricot \u2013 you can find in the gorgeously sticky but balanced style dessert wine made from late-harvested, nobly rotten grapes such as Tesco\u2019s completely delightful Sauternes.
