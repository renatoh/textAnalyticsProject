Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and presidential candidate, said the new online platform to be called Sutton Trust is intended to help the sixth-formers who would have been eligible for a place on the trust\u2019s face-to-face programmes cancelled because of coronavirus. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis has presented a whole new set of challenges for students from low-income families, interrupting the school year and cutting off access to resources that help students stay on track \u2013 like university application guidance,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cBloomberg Philanthropies has helped more than 70,000 talented low and middle-income students apply to and enrol in top colleges in the US through our virtual advising programme, and we\u2019re glad to support the work that Sutton Trust online is leading in the UK. \u201cA parent\u2019s income should never determine a child\u2019s likelihood of going to university \u2013 and with the coronavirus taking a devastating financial toll on families, and casting so much uncertainty into young people\u2019s lives, this work is more important and more urgent than ever before.\u201d The trust said the funding would create online content for students, and a platform for the sixth-formers to receive advice and teaching from the programme\u2019s higher education partners, including Imperial College London and the University of St Andrews. The trust said its residential and face-to-face summer programmes can only reach about 2,000 students each year, while around 6,000 eligible sixth-formers apply. \u201cThe new platform and the Bloomberg funding over three years means the 4,000 who currently don\u2019t get any provision will now get support,\u201d a spokesperson for the trust said. The students come from across the UK and have met social mobility criteria, such as eligibility for free school meals or were attending a school with a low progression rate to higher education. Sir Peter Lampl, the trust\u2019s chair and founder, said he was confident that the new platform will be a good substitute for its traditional summer schools. \u201cOur research has shown that the coronavirus has had a major impact on young people and will have a profound effect on their futures. High quality support is needed more than ever. But with face-to-face programmes unable to go ahead, there is a serious gap,\u201d Lampl said. The new platform will include features of the trust\u2019s summer schools, including academic content, guidance on applications and student finance, as well as an insight into university life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
