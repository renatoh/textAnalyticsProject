If you've seen it a few times and read about it, you will probably think there's nothing left to find out but I bet you won't know as much as Ken Barnes, an unassuming English film historian who gives us one of the best commentaries I've heard, weaving background, history and biography around key scenes which are left intact. He doesn't bother going round the block one more time on the stuff you will know about - Hearst, The War of the Worlds and San Simeon (except to tell us that both cinematographer Gregg Toland and co-writer Herman Mankiewicz had attended Hearst's parties there and both been kicked out for boozing). But did you know that that's Toland playing the reporter addressed as \"young man\" by Welles in the March of Time sequence? That that's Nat Cole tinkling the ivories in the background as Dorothy Comingore is interviewed? That there's back projection from King Kong behind Kane's picnic? That Joseph Cotten's \"crimitism\" in his drunk scene was an inspired mistake left in; or that Comingore's future would be blacklist and suicide. There are loads of documentaries too. This is all manna for old Kane bores. You may be coming to it for the first time, in which case I don't see how you could fail to be impressed by the wit, economy and imagination on display and some of the most outrageous dissolves, montages and compositions ever pulled off. Toland and Mankiewicz were the old hands. Almost everyone else was working on their first film, and while Welles didn't have the great career we all wanted to see, fellow debutant Bernard Herrmann had the best soundtrack credits ever, taking in Hitchcock's creative peak and finishing, in his final year, with Taxi Driver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
