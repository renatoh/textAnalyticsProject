His chocolate model of Barcelona's Columbus column for Picasso was so appreciated that he received a painting in payment. Escrib\u00e0 - who once said, \"I am the Ch\u00e9 Guevara of chocolate\" - was an all-round pastry cook, but was most famous for his work in chocolate. Customers paid large sums for the 1,500 chocolate Easter cakes, monas, that he hand-painted every year. In Catalonia, chocolate or pastry monas are given by godparents to their godchildren every Easter Monday. His cakes, bread and monas were often avant garde: some of his best-known ones were three-dimensional recreations of Dal\u00ed or Picasso paintings. He also made an extravagant chocolate Diego Maradona, when the footballer played for Barcelona, and a model of the Vatican, which he sent to the Pope. They were instant works of art, to be admired all the more intensely because their life was so short. The idea was they should taste even better than they looked. Escrib\u00e0 was born into a pastry-making family in Barcelona, whose first shop had opened in 1906. He himself had wanted to be a sculptor but he felt obliged to enter the family business in 1946, aged 16, later inheriting and developing two cake shops in Barcelona, on the Gran Via and the Ramblas, and opening a restaurant. There is a tradition of pastries and chocolate confectionery in Catalonia, and Escrib\u00e0 learned the craft in the family shops, before going to Paris to round off his training. There he met his wife, the daughter of a French confectioner. Escrib\u00e0 combined his artistic exuberance with a solid business sense. The key to his success was revolutionary shapes combined with traditional quality. He was outspoken and fiery in temperament. He polemicised against younger confectioners who used additives or margarine. He maintained that chocolate had to be pure, containing only cocoa, cocoa butter and sugar, and make a cracking sound when you bit into it. He gave classes all over the world and his fame was consecrated by the European master pastry cooks' prize in 1974. In May 2004, he was awarded Barcelona's Gold Medal for Artistic Merit. He is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their three sons, who will carry on the family business. \u00b7 Antoni Escrib\u00e0 i Serra, pastry cook and chocolate sculptor, born September 10 1930; died September 6 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
