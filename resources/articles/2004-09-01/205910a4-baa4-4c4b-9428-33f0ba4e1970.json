Kenwright was addressing an EGM at Goodison Park, called by 259 of the club's disgruntled shareholders who were concerned over Everton's financial future. The chairman departed having pledged to produce a credible strategic plan to address those concerns which will be presented at the club's AGM in December. For the time being, confirmation that the Fortress Sports Fund is eager to invest in the club and potentially take up a stake of 40% in Everton will reassure those present. \"They are an absolute possibility and, hopefully, it will be finalised in the next few weeks,\" said Kenwright. \"I think it will be for more than 40% in the long term. \"The original investment will be in the region of \u00a315m with an option on a further \u00a315m. They are very ambitious people and they could invest more in the future. I will be staying on as chairman and I think I am the right and best man to run this football club.\" The public face of the fund will be the Geneva-based businessman Christopher Samuelson, backed by the Zingarevich money, with Kenwright quick to dispel fears over Samuelson's credentials as a future board member. \"Christopher has a great track record and reputation in Geneva,\" said the chairman. \"We've undertaken searches on his credentials and they've come out good. We all hope the Fortress Sports Fund will invest heavily in our club in the future.\" Kenwright, who unveiled Keith Wyness as his chief executive, confirmed that another \u00a315m funding, put forward by the retail millionaire Philip Green, is effectively being used as a bridging loan until the influx of the Fortress money. Though the public show of unity between the chairman and his director Paul Gregg was welcomed, the meeting ended with one shareholder subjecting the club's head of PR and communications to a barrage of abuse. \u00b7 Blackburn Rovers' directors drew up a shortlist of five last night for the manager's role, with the Wales coach Mark Hughes their first choice to succeed Graeme Souness. The Rovers chief executive John Williams is expected to make a formal approach for Hughes over the next few days, though the board will interview all five candidates. G\u00e9rard Houllier, Glenn Hoddle and Dick Advocaat were among the 30 applicants. Hughes, a former Blackburn player who is still based in the area, is understood to be interested, though reluctant to give up his duties with Wales, and it may be that the Football Association of Wales and Rovers would be willing for him to continue with the national team on a part-time basis, with the arrangement to be reviewed after next month's World Cup qualifiers against England and Poland. \u00b7 The Bolton manager Sam Allardyce revealed yesterday that Newcastle approached him before appointing Souness as manager. \"I was hugely flattered,\" said Allardyce. \"It's great to be associated with such a massive club but the chairman didn't want me to go and I didn't want to walk out, so I made the decision to stay.\" Souness got a taste of dressing-room things to come when his request that Patrick Kluivert play for the reserves at Wolves on Tuesday was reportedly refused by the Dutchman, who started in Sir Bobby Robson's final first team a fortnight ago. Souness does not officially take the reins until Monday but will pick tomorrow's team to face Blackburn. It is thought unlikely to include Kluivert"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
