Tel: 01492 622878. Web address: www.gaypennanthall.co.uk First impressions A converted Edwardian villa, this is a gay-run establishment, exclusively for \"gays, lesbians and their friends\". It's been recently refurbished but, aside from homoerotic prints on the walls, the decor is as chintzy as any straight country-house hotel. Our welcome was warm, friendly and efficient. There is a cosy bar which opens into a conservatory, and \"Jack's Hydro\" - a spa, sauna, steam bath complex with a secluded sun terrace. The facilities are open to non-residents and appeared to be quite popular. What are the rooms like? Hardly spacious but comfortable with (terrestrial) TV, clock radio and complimentary condoms. Though the A55 and the railway run nearby, the hotel is surrounded by trees so the traffic noise is well muffled. The bed test Not too hard, not too soft, but a bit squeaky. The bathroom test Very compact, with shower but no full-length mirror. The restaurant Quite an ambitious menu, and the food is freshly prepared. The service, and the atmosphere, is relaxed and friendly. The lounge Deserted but with a nice view. What is there to see within walking distance? Penmaenmawr promenade and beach and the village itself, which is quite picturesque if you ignore the A55 dual carriageway that separates it from the sea. What is there to see within a 20-minute drive? Plenty. Castles galore, Snowdonia and the bizarre Italianate village of Portmeirion. How much a night? Singles \u00a325, doubles from \u00a345 per room. Watch out for special offers and theme weekends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
