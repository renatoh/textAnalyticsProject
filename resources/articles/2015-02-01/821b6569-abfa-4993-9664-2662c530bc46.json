Omar Ahmad, who owns Sage Care Home Group, comprising some 10 homes in Kent, Lancashire and Yorkshire, said the sector was at breaking point thanks to increasing red tape, a sharp decline in money available for the care of the elderly and the shortage of nursing staff. Ahmad said homes were closing all the time, just when the population is ageing and in more need of them. He attacked the Care Quality Commission \u2013 the independent regulator of health and social care services in England \u2013 for \u201ccontinually narrowing the goalposts\u201d for care home providers, yet offering no support or help to those who wanted to do the best for their residents. Ahmad is calling for better support for the sector, especially in attracting and retaining staff. \u201cMy care homes need a nurse on duty 24 hours a day. The local hospital will pay more than I can afford, and so I\u2019m stuck with those who have perhaps just come in from abroad and whose English isn\u2019t good enough or who are lazy. I\u2019d say about two or three out of five nurses are not up to the standard people expect of a British nurse.\u201d Ahmad said he was fed up with seeing the sick and old being let down: \u201cThese are people\u2019s lives at stake; we\u2019re not playing with objects.\u201d The critical shortage of nurses in the UK has been partially blamed by the Royal College of Nursing on a reduction in the numbers of training places available in 2010-13. It has led to an estimated three-quarters of England\u2019s hospital trusts recruiting from abroad. In 2014, one in five new nurses came from abroad. With the NHS paying nurses more, and offering more public service benefits, than the private sector can afford, says Ahmad, it makes the shortage even more acute, while the NHS is moving to try to get more older people out of hospitals and into long-term care. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to call other countries backward \u2013 I would call us backward in the way we treat our elderly. It\u2019s an absolute insult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat and nobody speaks up for us. While all the rows are going on about who pays for whose bill, it is left to us to pick up the pieces. I\u2019m footing the bill at the moment for a lady client whose bill stands at \u00a342,000 as the local authority hasn\u2019t paid up. That is happening all the time, it\u2019s very common. \u201cWe\u2019re not Scrooges; if we can help, we will. But it is not cheap to run a care home; it\u2019s not a hotel. Nor can you turn off the lights, or the heating, or the TVs to save on the bills. We want to extend the lives of our residents and give them the best care; we want them to be happy, but all the while the government is tightening up the welfare bill and local authorities arguing with families over who pays what. \u201cTo have a successful care home, you need quality staff, and if you can\u2019t get the staff it falls apart very quickly. Bad practice is allowed to flourish, and then you\u2019re into the realms of neglect. In the past few weeks, two nursing homes I know of have closed down because of a lack of nurses. I keep hearing about homes being closed down \u2013 people are getting out.\u201d Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association which represents private providers, said she sympathised with Ahmad. The association is seeing at least three care-home providers a month selling up. \u201cWe\u2019re all fighting for staff from the same shrinking pool and hospitals win hands down. They want older people our of hospitals, but the funding doesn\u2019t go with them. The provider sector isn\u2019t listened to. Ten years ago, we were not seeing people with such complex needs in care homes, because they were looked after by the NHS. Now, as the needs have increased, the money has all been cut. We went from rarely looking after people who were incontinent to looking after people who were doubly incontinent and have dementia. So immediately we\u2019re in crisis. The pressures are phenomenal. \u201cThere have been some terrible cases that have also done an image-demolition job on care homes, which the regulator has not handled well. We\u2019ve got men in suits telling us what to do, when at the core of our service it is women who care. This is a really difficult moment and no one is looking at the pressure under which a provider is trying to produce a viable service.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
