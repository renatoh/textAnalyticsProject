Thanks to John McDonnell, who stood aside, and MPs who twigged, belatedly perhaps, that they would look ridiculous with an all-white, all-male slate. Given that everyone knows she will widen the debate but can't win, is everyone happy? Not quite. We shan't forget that she, a Campaign group member, effectively scuppered the candidature of Campaign chairman McDonnell, seethes an activist on the left. Tokenism, favouritism, whinge comrades on the right. But this is Labour where the flak flies in all directions and, as we know, the misery keeps them cheerful. Three more months of this. Enjoy. \u2022 David Miliband's initial pitch to the party membership: \"I'm writing to ask you to join me on a journey to examine, redefine and rebuild our party. Because to be frank \u2013 I need you,\" he says. Resist the urge to feel queasy. \u2022 And some week this has been for the coalition, with George Osborne quite the tough guy during Treasury questions, and Danny Alexander all over the telly, the face of the cuts programme. How did they do? Some advice from Alastair Campbell. \"George, I think you need to watch that thing you do with your right hand at the dispatch box,\" blogs the great communicator. \"Well, two things actually. First, you tend to bang it on the dispatch box when you are not actually making strong points. This is an unwelcome and rather confusing distraction. Second, when you raise your hand from the dispatch box, you have a tendency to shape your fingers into an odd kind of claw shape. This is not attractive.\" As for Danny: back to basics. \"I caught a couple of your interviews yesterday and they were a bit 'um ... er ... kind of ... um ... er'-ish,\" counsels Alastair. If anyone can be cruel and yet kind, it's him. \u2022 They thought it was all over, but it isn't. Because Andy Coulson still finds himself breathlessly pursued over the News of the World phone hacking scandal. Here come a series of freedom of information requests from his would-be slayer, the Labour MP Tom Watson. What records exist relating to Coulson's appointment, he asks. How much is he paid? What security clearance does he have? What was the legal advice given to David Cameron about his status? Answers by 1 July. All over? Give over. \u2022 And as England plot their World Cup challenge from a lavish base in Rustenburg, our correspondent Reg Copley reveals a link between the fight against apartheid that occurred there in the early 60s and the Guardian. He worked then as a metallurgical chemist for the Hatton Garden bullion refiners, Johnson Matthey, when the company started a new venture: the Rustenburg Laboratory. Reg would analyse the products of the Rustenburg mines to find their content of precious and rare metals, and minerals. Once this was done, the unused material would be returned. \"We would always carefully wrap the glass containers in copies of the Guardian, as a way of feeding left-ish political thought to the mining workforce, and of letting them know that action was under way to bring an end to apartheid,\" reveals Reg, still triumphant. So in our own small way, we helped. \u2022 Happy days for the international criminal court, whose leaders are thinking great thoughts at a summit in Uganda. One result is the Kampala declaration on ending impunity. And they are holding those talks in just the right place, but perhaps a month too soon. For coming to town next month will be the heavy hitters in the African Union, among them \u2013 thanks to a U-turn by the Ugandan government \u2013 the Sudanese leader, Omar al-Bashir. He is still the only national leader currently subject to an outstanding ICC warrant for war crimes and genocide. But he'll be able to have a high old time in Kampala once the coast is clear. \u2022 Finally, the day may have passed, but in this the week of Joan Rivers's 77th birthday, readers continue to reflect on the comedian's many words of wisdom. \"Joan was asked what she thought about clubs for men,\" recalls John Richards of Cornwall. \"She said: 'I think we should reason with them first'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
