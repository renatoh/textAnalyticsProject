The top events of this afternoon: Biden can\u2019t decide if he supports the Hyde Amendment and said in 2006 he does not think abortion is a right, a newly surfaced video shows. A lot of Democratic candidates will be joining the first primary debate, the DNC announced today. The Federal Election Commission chair Ellen Weintraub would like to remind our President and other 2020 candidates that they cannot accept help from foreign governments to beat their opponents. That\u2019s all! See you next time. Federal Election Commission chair Ellen Weintraub clarified on Thursday candidates for American office are not allowed to solicit or accept help from foreign governments in connection to US campaigns after president Donald Trump stated he would welcome it. \u201cI would not have thought that I needed to say this,\u201d she said in a tweet accompanying the statement. On Wednesday, Trump told ABC News he would be open to accepting damaging information on his opponents in the 2020 election if it was offered by another country and would feel no obligation to tell the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This comes after a report from special counsel Robert Mueller found Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election with the aim of helping Trump win. Weintraub said any political campaign that receives an offer from a foreign government should report that offer to the FBI. Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, renewed her calls to impeach Trump in light of these statements. \u201cA foreign government attacked our 2016 elections to support Trump, Trump welcomed that help, and Trump obstructed the investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, he said he\u2019d do it all over again. It\u2019s time to impeach Donald Trump.\u201d A teen mom and her premature baby were neglected in a border patrol facility for a week, lawyers who visited an immigration processing station in McAllen, Texas said on Wednesday. The baby was \u201clistless\u201d and the mother was in a wheelchair after complications from an emergency C-section, the immigration and human rights lawyers said. \u201cI looked at that baby and said \u2018Who does this to babies?\u2019\u201d lawyer Hope Frye said, according to the Huffington Post. \u201cThey were being sadistically ignored.\u201d The incident underscored ongoing human rights concerns with immigration processing centers on the border, where minors are often separated from family members and kept in cages. Five children have died in Border Patrol custody since December. The legal team is working to get the mother and her child released from the facility. A federal court declared Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid tactics unconstitutional on Thursday. A Los Angeles court ruled that an raid at a Van Nuys factory violated Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Enforcement officials had warrants for fewer than 10 people working there but detained more than 130 people, forcing them to undergo interrogations without attorneys. Dozens of those illegally interrogated were held without food or water for more than 18 hours, according to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, which brought represented one of the workers interrogated in the case. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling sends a powerful message: everyone has the right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures,\u201d Ahilan Arulanantham, senior counsel at the ACLU SoCal said. The Democratic National Convention announced on Thursday nearly 20 Democratic candidates have been invited to participate in the June 26 and 27 initial primary debates. Here are the candidates who have been invited. Those marked by asterisks qualified through both polling and grassroots fundraising thresholds and others qualified through polling only. Sen. Michael Bennet Vice President Joe Biden* Sen. Cory Booker* Mayor Pete Buttigieg* Sec. Julian Castro* Mayor Bill de Blasio Rep. John Delaney Rep. Tulsi Gabbard* Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand* Sen. Kamala Harris* Gov. John Hickenlooper Gov. Jay Inslee* Sen. Amy Klobuchar* Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke* Rep. Tim Ryan Sen. Bernie Sanders* Rep. Eric Swalwell Sen. Elizabeth Warren* Ms. Marianne Williamson* Mr. Andrew Yang* The debates will take place at 9 pm ET on June 26 and 27 in Miami, Florida and will be broadcast on NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo. Betsy Sweet, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Maine, said Thursday she will challenge Republican Susan Collins for her seat in the Senate, according to the Hill. Sweet, who has been endorsed by progressive political group Democracy for America, will join other Democrats likely to challenge Collins including State House Speaker Sarah Gideon. Collins is on her fourth term as a Senator in the state and is seen as a moderate, but came under fire for voting to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh despite concerns about past sexual misconduct. \u201cOur division isn\u2019t between our neighbors on the left and right,\u201d Sweet said in her announcement. \u201cThe division is between us and them \u2013 between working people and the rich and powerful elite who are lining the pockets of politicians and putting the needs of Maine families at the bottom of the list.\u201d A 2006 video of Joe Biden unearthed by CNN on Thursday shows the Democratic presidential candidate saying he does not view abortion as \u201ca choice and a right.\u201d \u201cI do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it\u2019s always a tragedy,\u201d Biden said in a videotaped interview with Texas Monthly. \u201cI think it should be rare and safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions.\u201d The clip is the latest bit of evidence of Biden\u2019s inconsistent record on the issue of abortion. Last week, he flip flopped on his position on the Hyde amendment, a measure that prohibits the use of federal funding for abortions. One day after saying he supported the Hyde amendment, following backlash from Democrats, he said he can no longer support the ban. \u201cIf I believe healthcare is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s zip code,\u201d he told an audience at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta on Thursday, June 6. Kim Kardashian spoke at the White House on Thursday afternoon about criminal justice reform and announced a ride-share partnership so formerly incarcerated people can get rides to and from job interviews. \u201cI want to thank the president for standing behind this issue,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing the compassion he has for this issue has just been really remarkable.\u201d In June 2018, President Trump commuted the life sentence of 63-year-old Alice Marie Johnson who was convicted of cocaine trafficking in 1996. \u201cMy whole journey with criminal justice reform started about a year ago when I came to see the President after speaking to Ivanka and Jared, who really fought for me to get here,\u201d she said. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog this afternoon. More news soon. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will leave the administration at the end of June. Trump tweeted he hoped she would run for governor of Arkansas, and also wrongly tweeted her tenure. She served for less than two years as press secretary, and two and a half in the administration. The US Office of Special Counsel (*a watchdog agency not to be confused with special counsel Robert Mueller) said the Trump administration should remove Kellyanne Conway from office because of her repeated violations of the Hatch Act. The act works to keep certain functions of the government nonpartisan. The office called her a \u201crepeat offender\u201d. Trump said he would accept opposition research from foreign governments. Democrats in the Senate tried to expedite a bill to require campaigns to disclose foreign contacts to law enforcement \u2013 namely the FBI \u2013 which was thwarted by Republicans. Democratic 2020 candidates are hitting out against former Vice President Joe Biden, who can\u2019t seem to stop making jokes about young women. Maine expanded access to abortion rights, in the face of new restrictions from states like Alabama, Ohio and Missouri. Michigan starts Flint investigations anew. The state attorney general said they would dismiss charges in the investigation of Flint\u2019s lead-tainted water, and would re-investigate the contamination crisis which roiled the city for years. Here are some highlights from our past reporting on Sarah Sanders. Sarah Sanders tweeted a doctored video of CNN reporter Sanders eagerly placed herself at the centre of a media storm last week when she defended the White House\u2019s decision to revoke CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass by claiming that in a press briefing Acosta placed \u201chis hands on a young woman\u201d. Of course, as everyone who watched the briefing on TV could see, what actually happened was that the female intern, encouraged by Trump, tried to grab the microphone away from Acosta when he started to ask a second question. To back up her blatant lie, Sanders retweeted a clearly doctored video, originally tweeted by conspiracist blog InfoWars, in which two seconds of tape were sped up to make it look like Acosta somehow karate chopped the female intern. \u201cThis conduct is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d tweeted Sanders, apparently unaware that she works for a man who bragged about grabbing women by the vulva during his campaign. Sarah Sanders admitted to lying to reporters about FBI director firing After Trump fired James Comey, the White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders repeatedly claimed in live press briefings that the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in the FBI director, and that \u201cwe\u2019ve heard from countless members of the FBI\u201d who did not support him. Those statements had no basis in fact, Sanders later admitted in interviews with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office. Sarah Sanders reiterates Comey claims despite admitting to lying Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has defended claims she repeatedly made to reporters in 2017 regarding Donald Trump\u2019s firing of then FBI director James Comey \u2013 despite admitting to investigators for the special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no basis in fact. Sanders admitted in statements to the special counsel that her repeated claims that the president fired Comey because the rank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in him as FBI director were \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and \u201cnot founded on anything\u201d. Rumors have swirled for months that Sanders would leave the White House. Trump did not name a replacement. Trump\u2019s tweet wrongly asserts Sanders\u2019 time in the White House. She has been in the administration for two and a half \u2013 not three and a half \u2013 years. Sanders has not held a White House press briefing in 94 days, according to Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Epstein. The Michigan attorney general has dropped all charges in the Flint water case, opting to start a new investigation. The office said it would not respond to any media inquiries until after a \u201ccommunity conversation\u201d in Flint \u2013 two weeks from now. US Senator Chuck Schumer is now speaking on the FIRE bill, which would require political candidates to report contacts from foreign governments to law enforcement, and the FBI in particular. Republicans have already blocked Democrats\u2019 request for expediting the bill. How minimal,\u201d Schumer said about the request. \u201cHow minimal.\u201d \u201cThe things he does severely damage our democracy,\u201d said Schumer.\u201cIt\u2019s ok for foreign powers to interfere?\u201d ... \u201cToday is a new low for this Senate, for this Republican party here in the Senate, and for this democracy.\u201d He pledged to request the bill be expedited again, called \u201cunanimous consent\u201d. Without passing the bill, he said, would \u201cencourage Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, to interfere in our elections with no recourse \u2013 shame, shame.\u201d Democratic Senator Mark Warner is expected to ask for expedited hearings on a bill to require reporting of foreign contacts with campaigns. The request follows President Trump\u2019s comments to ABC that he would accept offers of opposition research from foreign governments. You can watch live with us here. Warner first introduced the bill in the Senate a month ago, called the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections or FIRE Act. This is what Warner said about the bill a month ago: Most Americans already know that if a foreign adversary reaches out about interfering in our elections, you should report that contact. But after Special Counsel Robert Mueller identified at least 140 contacts between Trump associates and Russian nationals or WikiLeaks, it\u2019s clear that some Americans haven\u2019t taken that responsibility seriously \u2013 in fact, the Trump campaign welcomed the help, and sought to hide that from the American people. This bill would protect the integrity of our democracy by requiring future campaigns to report attempts by foreign nationals to coordinate or collaborate during a political campaign, and by putting campaigns on notice about their obligations,\u201d said Warner. The House Oversight Committee has invited White House aide Kellyanne Conway to a hearing next week on her repeated violations of the Hatch Act. The Office of Special Counsel (a government watchdog agency, not Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry!) said today Conway has been a \u201crepeat offender\u201d violating the Hatch Act, which is meant to keep certain government functions nonpartisan. The agency, headed by a Trump nominee, said it has \u201cnever\u201d before had to issue multiple warnings about Hatch Act violations to an administration. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed Iran is responsible for the an attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. More from our story: Iran is lashing out because the regime wants our successful maximum pressure campaign lifted. No economic sanctions entitle the Islamic Republic to attack innocent civilians disrupt global oil markets and engage in nuclear blackmail.\u201d Pompeo did not present evidence for his claim. Tehran denied all responsibility and its foreign minister suggested that others could be trying to provoke a conflict between Iran and the US. The incident took place on a day Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, bluntly rejected the proposal of a resumption of US-Iranian talks, suggested by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on a visit to Tehran. The US Department of Education is taking steps to investigate foreign donations to US colleges. More from the Associated Press: Letters sent to the schools Thursday and obtained by The Associated Press accuse the schools of failing to report gifts and contracts tied to their branch campuses in Qatar. Investigators also are demanding years of records related to funding from sources in China, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Officials at Georgetown and Texas A&amp;M haven\u2019t immediately responded to requests for comment. Federal law requires colleges to report gifts or contracts with any foreign source amounting to $250,000 or more in a year, but some lawmakers say the Education Department has done too little to enforce the rule. Former Vice President Joe Biden is being criticized for frequently using a lock-up-your-daughters style joke at multiple public events, including most recently in Iowa. Biden has used the joke as a standard line since at least 2011, according to Slate, including twice to former Republican US Senator Orrin Hatch\u2019s granddaughter at swearing-ins. Warren has called herself a \u201ccapitalist\u201d, in contrast to Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. Sanders will be one of her toughest opponents to beat. However, a surprising new poll from Axios found socialism may not be as toxic as some might expect. Forty percent of Americans would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one, with a majority of younger women having this preference, according to a new poll. ... Although 55% of women in the 18-54 age group said they would prefer living in a socialist country, \u201ca majority of men prefer to live in a capitalist country\u201d, Axios noted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a truth of American politics for decades that women are to the left of men, and I think that\u2019s playing out in this poll,\u201d said Felix Salmon of Axios. Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is gaining momentum \u201cplan by plan\u201d, our Washington DC reporter Lauren Gambino writes. Her intense campaigning on a vast swathe of specific issues has achieved viral moments on the internet \u2013 even including one woman whom Warren advised on her love life \u2013 as well as playing well during recent television events. At a televised town hall in Indiana this week, Warren listened intently as a woman who voted for Trump in 2016 described her disillusionment \u2013 not only with a president who failed to bring back manufacturing jobs as he said he promised but with an entire political system stymied by dysfunction. \u201cI feel duped,\u201d said the voter, Renee Elliott, who was laid off from her job at the Indianapolis Carrier plant. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith in political candidates much anymore. They make promises. They make them and break them.\u201d Warren rose to her feet. \u201cThe thing is, you can\u2019t just wave your arms,\u201d the she said, gesturing energetically. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to have a plan \u2013 and I do have a plan.\u201d That mantra \u2013 a nod to the steady churn of policy blueprints Warren\u2019s campaign has released \u2013 has become a rallying cry for Warren as she edges her way to the top of the crowded Democratic presidential primary field. Worth looking at the excellent pictures from this Time magazine story: The journey to the Fijian village of Vunidogoloa is arduous. It requires a flight across the Pacific to the nation\u2019s remote international transit hub, a 140-mile connection on a rickety 19-seat plane to a smaller island, an hourlong drive past other rural villages and finally a short walk guided by a man with a machete to reach a ghost town forced into retreat by climate change and the rising seas that come with it. As the climate crisis emerges as a top issue for Democratic 2020 presidential nominees... You can read the entirety of the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s letter about White House aide Kellyanne Conway here. Here\u2019s a bit more about the investigation: OSC\u2019s career Hatch staff have long conducted thorough and impartial investigations of alleged Hatch Act violations, including by senior officials in administrations of both parties. Never has the OSC had to issue multiple reports to the president concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual. Ms. Conway\u2019s actions and statements stand in stark contrast to the culture of compliance promised by your White House counsel and undermine your efforts to create and enforce such as culture. Therefore OSC respectfully requests that Ms. Conway be held to the same standards as all other federal employees, and, as such you find removal from federal service to be the appropriate disciplinary action. Kellyanne Conway has apparently refused to comment on the report, according to Eamon Javers of CNBC. The White House has called the report from Office of Special Counsel \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201cunevenly applied\u201d. It also blamed \u201cliberal organizations\u201d. Here is more via Washington Post: Others, of all political views, have objected to the OSC\u2019s unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Steven Groves said in a statement. \u201cIts decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations, and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, nonpolitical manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.\u201d Kellyanne Conway has been reprimanded for violating the Hatch Act before. In early 2018, the Office of Special Counsel released a report finding Conway violated the Hatch Act when she advocated on behalf of disgraced former US Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama. The US Office of Special Counsel has recommended White House aide Kellyanne Conway be removed from office because of repeated Hatch Act violations. The Hatch Act requires certain government activities be nonpartisan. The 1939 law is enforced by the US Office of Special Counsel. The agency is separate and apart from the investigative work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller who investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democratic Governor Janet Mills just signed a bill requiring public and private health insurance companies to cover abortion as part of pre-natal services for women. The news follows passage of a law allowing nurse practitioners to perform abortions. Abortions are one of the safest medical procedures in the US. In the last few years, banning insurance companies from paying for abortion has emerged as a tactic to restrict access to the procedure. Abortion costs about $600 out-of-pocket, not including other costs such as travel. Here is more from the ACLU, which was challenging bans against insurance payments in court in Maine: With the passage of these laws, Maine has taken huge strides to protect the safety and autonomy of all people,\u201d said Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director for the ACLU of Maine. \u201cThese laws affirm that abortion is health care, and that everyone should have access to the health care they need \u2013 regardless of where they live or how much money they make.\u201d The ACLU has been litigating both of these issues in Maine, and applauded the actions of the legislature and the governor. \u201cThere is no justification for discriminating against people based on their personal medical decisions,\u201d said Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine. \u201cWe are pleased that the legislative branch and executive branch agree, and we are hopeful that the judicial branch will agree as well.\u201d More fallout from Trump\u2019s ABC interview, in which he said he would accept information on opponents from foreign governments \u2013 Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would submit a bill to mandate campaign reports on foreign information. On those tariffs \u2013 US Senators today urged the Trump administration not to use Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, as a bargaining chip in any negotiations in the trade war citing national security concerns. Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner urged the Trump administration, \u201cIn no way should Huawei be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations,\u201d in a letter reported by Reuters. In manufacturing news, the US Trade Representative\u2019s office has denied a request from Tesla for relief from 25% tariffs with China, imposed by the Trump administration. Here is more from Reuters: The Trump administration has denied requests to exempt Tesla Inc\u2019s Model 3 from 25% tariffs on its Chinese-made car computer and center screen, according to letters seen by Reuters. The US Trade Representative\u2019s Office denied both requests in May 29 letters, saying they both concern \u201ca product strategically important or related to \u2018Made in China 2025* or other Chinese industrial programs.\u201d The California-based electric vehicle manufacturer had warned that increased tariffs on the car computer it dubbed the \u201cbrains\u201d of the Model 3 causes *economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.* Tesla had also urged the office to approve a request by its supplier SAS Automotive USA Inc, builder of the center display screen for the Model 3. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has criticized President Trump for saying he would accept dirt on opponents from foreign governments. However, he also went on to criticize Democrats for hiring the British former intelligence agent Christopher Steele to perform opposition research. Although Biden is still the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, his opponents on hot on his heels. Helpfully, we have a graphic out today on where all the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls stand on the most important issues. Biden also drew criticism for his support of the Hyde amendment, a provision of federal law which bars the government from paying for abortion services. The provision primarily impacts Medicaid, a public health insurance program for the poor and disabled which covers about 17 million women of reproductive age. Biden walked back his support of the Hyde amendment after intense criticism. Without referring to Biden\u2019s position, California Senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Kamala Harris spoke about how opposition to the amendment to NPR Politics. Listen, I\u2019ll speak for myself,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe bottom line on the Hyde Amendment is that it is directly, in effect, targeting poor women and women who don\u2019t have money.\u201d Democrats are expected to vote for a spending bill including the provision in the coming days. Removing the provision could spark a fight between the Democrat-led House and Republican-led Senate. In some of the most pointed criticism to date, Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke criticized Joe Biden, the former vice-president and frontrunner in the campaign. \u201cYou cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that\u2019s good enough,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told NBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cAs much of a horror show as Trump has been, his racism, the disaster of his foreign policy, his punishment of farmers and workers here in tis country \u2013 we had problems before Trump became president.\u201d \u201cWe cannot return to the past, we cannot simply be about beating Donald Trump.\u201d Other candidates have also criticized Biden as a figure of the past, including South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said nominating Biden would be like turning the clock \u201cback to the 1990s\u201d, according to NBC. It\u2019s been two months since Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the military took full effect, and the results have been devastating, a Guardian investigation shows. The ban touches 15,000 personnel who could must remain completely closeted, or face disqualification if they are outed. For Emily Finnerty, a trans woman and F-18 Super Hornet fighter pilot, the damage is tangible. Here\u2019s more from our report today: My children didn\u2019t know me, I was away so much. My back\u2019s destroyed from the G-force. I\u2019ve had near-death experiences from aircraft failure and I\u2019ve seen friends die. But I\u2019ve never betrayed the trust of my country and I\u2019ve always answered the call.\u201d ... She is puzzled by the vast contrast between the faith that the military has put in her over so many years, and the utter lack of faith it is showing her now. \u201cThey have invested millions in me, and I have performed my duties to an exceptional level,\u201d she said. \u201cYet because I see myself as a woman, I\u2019m somehow less worthy to serve.\u201d The ironies of Finnerty\u2019s position are not lost on her. Her mission within the military, she believes, is to serve the US constitution and uphold the freedom and human rights of her fellow Americans and people around the world. Yet to do so, she must forego her own freedom and human rights. \u201cMy fellow service members and I have tried to build a better, safer world for people, but it\u2019s a world I can\u2019t live in,\u201d she said. If you watch the House Intelligence Committee hearing along with us, check out the livestream here. The House Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates and former White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to testify. Here is Congressman Adam Schiff\u2019s statement, via The Hill: \u201cAs part of our oversight work, the House Intelligence Committee is continuing to examine the deep counterintelligence concerns raised in Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report, and that requires speaking directly with the fact witnesses,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California. \u201cBoth Michael Flynn and Rick Gates were critical witnesses for Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation, but so far have refused to cooperate fully with Congress.\u201d Donald Trump appears to have inadvertently misspelled the Prince of Wales in a rebuttal to his statement to ABC that he would accept information on opponents from foreign governments. \u2022The House intelligence committee is holding a hearing on \u2018National Security Challenges of Artificial Intelligence, Manipulated Media and Deepfakes\u2019 at 9am. It comes after a tampered video of Nancy Pelosi \u2013 a deepfake \u2013 was widely shared in May. Facebook refused to delete the video, which was manipulated to question Pelosi\u2019s competence. They may also address anticipated Russian interference in the 2020 election. \u2022In other political skullduggery news, Donald Trump has said he would accept incriminating information from Russia or other adversaries on his 2020 election opponent. \u201cIt\u2019s not an interference,\u201d Trump told ABC. \u201cThey have information \u2014 I think I\u2019d take it.\u201d The president said he would call the FBI if approached only \u201cif I thought there was something wrong.\u201d \u2022With the first televised debates less than two weeks away, the Democratic 2020 race continues in earnest.
