With some reports putting the US death toll above 2,000, here\u2019s our nightlead, by Richard Luscombe and Victoria Bekiempis: Here, meanwhile, is Tom McCarthy and Ed Pilkington\u2019s coruscating look at how Donald Trump failed his greatest test \u2013 preparing for Covid-19: And Sam Levin, from Los Angeles: And Oliver Milman itemising some of Trump\u2019s most misleading claims about the coronavirus outbreak: And finally, our updating map of coronavirus cases in the US: Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Trump and Cuomo clash as president weighs New York quarantine. The US president floated the idea of an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d of parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, an idea which New York\u2019s governor would later in the afternoon brand \u201cpreposterous\u201d and a recipe for \u201cchaos and mayhem\u201d. Rhode Island governor issues \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 order amid pandemic. One day after announcing her state\u2019s first two deaths from the coronavirus, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo has issued an order mandating that residents stay at home. ER doctor who criticized lack of protective gear says he was fired. An emergency room doctor who spoke out about the lack of coronavirus safety protections in place at his workplace in Bellingham, Washington, about 90 miles north of Seattle, said he was fired on Friday. Former Republican senator Tom Coburn dies. The Republican senator from Oklahoma has died at 72. A doctor who resigned his Senate seat following his cancer diagnosis, Coburn pushed for a constitutional convention and advocated for a range of conservative fiscal causes. \u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about my health, my prognosis or even my hopes and desires,\u201d he said then. President attacks \u2018lamestream media\u2019 as coronavirus cases rise. Trump started his Saturday tweeting complaints about \u201cthe Lamestream media\u201d. Various stories have got the president\u2019s goat, including one which said he has consulted New York Yankees star, drugs cheat and partner of Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez about how to tackle the crisis. Cuomo also says he would sue the state of Rhode Island if they don\u2019t roll back their \u201creactionary and illegal policy\u201d to stop cars with New York license places to ensure passengers are self-quartantining, though he remains confident they can work it out \u201camicably\u201d. \u201cNo state should be using police to limit interstate travel,\u201d Cuomo said. Earlier today, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo issued an executive order mandating that residents stay at home, banning gatherings of more than five people, shuttering all non-essential businesses for two weeks and requiring that all people entering into the state for a nonwork-related purpose self-quarantine for 14 days. New York governor Andrew Cuomo says Trump\u2019s proposal of an enforceable quarantine for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is a \u201cpreposterous\u201d idea and counter-productive toward the president\u2019s goals of restarting the economy. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem,\u201d Cuomo said on CNN. \u201cIf you start walling off areas all across the country, it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, antisocial.\u201d He added: That\u2019s not a quarantine. That would be a lockdown. If you said that we are geographically confining people, that would be a lockdown. Then we would be Wuhan, China. And that wouldn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cThis is a time when the president says he\u2019s trying to restart the economy. New York is the financial sector. You geographically restrict a state, you would paralyze the financial sector. You think the Dow Jones has gone down [now], it would drop like a stone. I don\u2019t even believe it\u2019s legal [due to the] interstate commerce clause. \u201cI think it would be exactly the opposite of everything the president is talking about. How would you ever operationally stop goods from coming to New York and New Jersey and Connecticut?\u201d Cuomo says he doubts Trump was even serious about the idea, saying the president didn\u2019t mention it even in passing when they spoke on the phone this morning. If the president was considering this, I guarantee you he would have called me. We talk about relatively trivial matters when it comes to dealing with this situation. This, this is a civil war kind of discussion.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on Trump\u2019s remark which is now of course subject to being rewritten\u2026 The Illinois department of health has announced the first known infant death from Covid-19 in the state. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said an investigation is under way to determine the cause of death and whether the child, who was younger than one year, had other health issues. \u201cThere has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant,\u201d said Dr Ngozi Ezike, the director of the Illinois department of public health. \u201cA full investigation is under way to determine the cause of death. We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us.\u201d According to the AP, the infection rate among children of Covid-19 is extremely rare: The risk of death and severe illness from Covid-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with Covid-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized. Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill. The Associated Press reports that leaders of a number of South Carolina cities are defying the opposition of the state\u2019s governor to stay-at-home orders: Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures. In Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city\u2019s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson\u2019s Friday opinion is incorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis. McMaster issued a new executive order on Friday mandating that anyone entering South Carolina from New York and other known coronavirus hotspots \u2013 New Jersey, Connecticut and New Orleans \u2013 must quarantine themselves for 14 days, but the Republican governor reiterated his stance that he sees no reason for residents to remain at home or shelter-in-place. \u201cWe hope that our visitors will be as responsible as the people of South Carolina have been in following the recommendations and requirements,\u201d McMaster said at a Friday afternoon news conference. \u201dThis is a requirement that has the force of law.\u201d There were 539 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths on Friday at the time of McMaster\u2019s order. One day after announcing her state\u2019s first two deaths from the coronavirus, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo has issued an order mandating that residents stay at home. Raimondo said the directive will extend through 13 April and will ban gatherings of more than five people, shutter all non-essential businesses for two weeks and mandate that all people entering into the state for a nonwork-related purpose self-quarantine for 14 days. \u201cToday, I\u2019m issuing a stay at home order that will be in place until April 13. This means unless you\u2019re getting food, medicine, gas or going to work, you need to stay home,\u201d Raimondo said. She continued: \u201cYou can go outside to get some fresh air, but if you leave your home, keep the time out to a minimum and always keep 6 feet away from others. Starting immediately, all gatherings of more than 5 people are banned. This means everywhere. If you have to go to work, you should be limiting your time there and interacting with as few people as possible. \u201cIn addition, starting immediately, any person coming to RI by any mode of transportation after visiting any other state for a non-work-related purpose must self-quarantine for 14 days. This restriction will not apply to public health, public safety or healthcare workers. \u201cI want to make a note to commuters. As I\u2019ve already said, if you\u2019re able to work from home, you\u2019re required to do so. If you live in RI and work in another state at a job where you can\u2019t work from home, you can go to work. But when you come home to RI, you must self-quarantine. Starting Monday, all non-essential retail businesses must shut down their stores. I don\u2019t make this decision lightly, but I\u2019m hearing too many reports of crowded stores. So for now, we need you to shop online to support your local retailers.\u201d The death of one person in their 80s on Friday night and another in their 70s on Saturday in Rhode Island leaves only three US states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming. More than 200 people have been confirmed to have the virus in the Ocean State, according to the Rhode Island department of health. A supplemental pool nugget \u2013 the best kind of nugget \u2013 lands in the Guardian\u2019s nugget-riddled inbox: New acting chief of staff Mark Meadows, who also deplaned Marine 1, responded to questions about POTUS\u2019 authority to quarantine states: We\u2019re evaluating those options right now. \u201cDeplaned\u201d \u2013 the most irritating bit of official-ese in current use? Probably not. But it would still be nice to be able to tell anyone who uses it\u2026 where to get off. Trump is back at the White House after his visit to Norfolk, Virginia for the departure of the USNS Comfort, the navy hospital ship which is heading for New York. On arrival the president did not answer questions, the pool reports, about his remarks about possible quarantine for the Empire state, New Jersey and Connecticut. Here\u2019s what was said at Joint Base Andrews earlier, as rendered by the pool reporter: THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be making a decision. A lot of the states that aren\u2019t infected, that don\u2019t have a big problem, they\u2019ve asked me if I\u2019d look at it. So we\u2019re going to look at it. And it will be for a short period of time, if we do it at all. Q Would it be -- THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019ll be New York. Q Would you call up the national guard? THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019ll be New York, parts of Connecticut, and parts of New Jersey. Q And then, do you close down the subway? Do you close down the bridges, the tunnels? THE PRESIDENT: No, we won\u2019t do that. We\u2019re talking about leaving New York. Leaving New York. They go to Florida, and a lot of people don\u2019t want that. So we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019re going to make a decision. Q Would you use the military for that, sir? Would you call up the guard? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re not going to need much. The people of New York, they understand it better than anybody, and they\u2019ll be great. Trump\u2019s remarks have certainly sowed confusion, seeming to blindside New York governor Andrew Cuomo as he gave a press conference in Albany, the state capital. At Joint Base Andrews, the president said: \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the governor about it later.\u201d Here\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis with the report on the day so far: Florida governor Ron DeSantis says his administration is looking into ways to secure the state border amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying \u201cit\u2019s not fair to the people of Florida\u201d that outsiders have continued to flock to the state. \u201cI don\u2019t as governor have the ability to shut down flights,\u201d he says during his daily briefing. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s an issue when people who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone, to come to different parts of the country.\u201d DeSantis says they have instituted a 14-day self-quarantine for all visitors from New York airports. All arrivals are met by National Guard and Department of Health personnel to be screened, provided information and given the instruction about self-isolation. The governor says he\u2019s signed an executive order to establish a checkpoint at the Louisiana state border on Interstate 10 to inspect people entering the state and his administration is looking to the same at the border on I-95, the point of entry for most New Yorkers. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida has soared to 3,763, more than five times the total of 706 from a week ago. Eight more deaths were reported overnight on Saturday, bringing the overall total to 54. The Associated Press reports that New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment: The donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields. \u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said. The Bayou State has emerged as one of the biggest hotspots of the pandemic with deaths from Covid-19 surging by more than 40% in a single day earlier this week. There were more than 3,300 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning\u2019s latest update with 549 new cases since Friday. The number of reported deaths is up to 137, up from 119 yesterday. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19 will not be allowed to board domestic flights or intercity trains. The directive will go into effect on Monday at noon. \u201cIt will be important for operators of airlines and trains to ensure that people who are exhibiting symptoms do not board those trains,\u201d Trudeau said during his daily address. \u201cIt will be a Transport Canada rule that will be enforced, but at the same time, we\u2019re telling people stay home if it\u2019s not absolutely essential for you to travel.\u201d The Public Health Agency of Canada will provide guidance to air operators and rail companies on conducting health checks on passengers boarding flights and trains within Canada or departing the country. Ohio governor Mike DeWine says Battelle labs has developed technology that would sterilize PPE masks and makes a public appeal for the FDA to give approval for its implementation, adding that it would help in current hotspots like Seattle and New York. The governor says the process could sterilize 80,000 masks per machine daily. \u201cPlease, please approve these. This would boost our capacity to be able to re-use these,\u201d DeWine says at his ongoing news conference at the state house in Columbus. \u201cPlease do this. It really is truly a matter of life and death.\u201d He follows with a second plea to Quest and LabCorps to ramp up their testing capacity, saying the state\u2019s confirmed total coronavirus cases climbed to 1,406, including 344 hospitalizations and 25 deaths, with the apex expected in mid-May. Trump is now speaking in front of the USNS Comfort hospital ship, which sets sail Saturday for coronavirus-stricken New York City. The USNS Comfort is due to arrive in Manhattan on Monday. Trump\u2019s travel to Norfolk, Virginia to bid the USNS Comfort bon voyage stands at odds with public health officials\u2019s advisories against non-essential travel due to coronavirus. \u201cThis great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York, a place I know very well, a place I love,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe are with you all the way, and always will be.\u201d \u201cYou have the unwavering support of the entire nation, the entire government, and the entire American people,\u201d Trump says. Trump\u2019s message of unity toward New York came in the wake of comments that he was weighing the imposition of a quarantine on this state, as well as New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference that Trump hadn\u2019t mentioned a possible quarantine during a call with him earlier. \u201cWe will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers, and the health of people in our country,\u201d Trump also says in front of the USNS Comfort, insisting that people from the New York metro area self-quarantine if they travel elsewhere. \u201cI am now considering, and will make a decision very quickly, very shortly, a quarantine because it\u2019s such a hot area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, we\u2019ll be announcing that one way or another fairly soon,\u201d he also said. \u201cThis does not apply to people such as truckers from outside the New York area \u2026 it won\u2019t affect trade in any way.\u201d Houston mayor Sylvester Turner says there are 232 positive Covid-19 cases (up from 69 yesterday) in Texas\u2019s biggest metropolis during a briefing at ISD\u2019s Butler Stadium, the city\u2019s first non-private testing site. \u201cThe numbers will rise as we continue testing,\u201d he says. The mayor says the second coronavirus death has been recorded today and three more Houston police officers have tested positive, bringing the total count to seven. \u201cIt is our intent collectively to blunt the progression of this virus,\u201d Turner says. \u201cTo slow down the growth, the spread, so that our healthcare delivery system is not overwhelmed. We see what\u2019s happening in New York and in Louisiana and in other places. We\u2019re trying to get ahead of that, to slow the progression, and so we need everyone to really take this situation seriously.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople may just look at the numbers and say the numbers in New York are 25,000 and the state of New York are 45,000, but in the city of Houston the numbers are just 232. And there are 2.3 million people just in the city alone and over five million people in our surrounding region, so that\u2019s not a big deal. Well let me just say, the testing has been limited. We know that there are more cases. And the way I look at it is, I take 232 and I multiply it times 10. Because we just dont know. Don\u2019t get bogged down on the numbers. The more testing we do, the numbers are going to rise.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposal of an \u201cenforcable quarantine\u201d for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut was the big news from his press gaggle before departing on Marine One for Norfolk, where he is scheduled to make remarks and bid bon voyage to the USNS Comfort, which is bound for New York to provide relief to hospitals overwhelmed with responding to the coronavirus. Moments ago, he made it Twitter official. Some of the toplines from New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing, which ended moments ago: Cuomo said the price of a ventilator has increased from $25,000 when the state began purchasing to about $45,000 today due to the spike in demand New York pharmacies have been asked to deliver medications free of charge President Trump has approved four additional temporary hospital sites with a total capacity of 4,000 additional beds Cuomo says 600 beds will be reserved for coronavirus patients only at three of the purpose-built sites The number of New York coronavirus cases increased to 52,318 and deaths to 728 \u2013 but hospitalizations dropped from 847 on Friday from 1,154 on Thursday Cuomo says he did not discuss a potential \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in reference to Trump\u2019s comments on the North Lawn only moments earlier The New York police department saw its third coronavirus death on Saturday, with the passing of a detective, the New York Post reported. The detective, who worked at a precinct station house in Manhattan\u2019s Harlem neighborhood, was 48. An NYPD administrative aide, and a department janitor, died Thursday due to Covid-19. On Friday, the police department said Friday that 442 uniformed, and 70 civilian, members tested positive for coronavirus. There were 4,111 uniformed employees who called out sick, comprising 11.4% of NYPD\u2019s uniformed workforce. Cuomo says he believes the broad distribution of a home test for people, to ensure the state is on the downside of the apex, is the most direct route toward re-opening the economy. \u201cGet those home tests that other countries are starting to use and let people test themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could get to a point where you say ... do the test, you\u2019re negative, go to work, period.\u201d The governor adds that he is against raising taxes to generate more revenue in the state budget: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you raise taxes on people who are out of work and their business has closed because the government needs more funding. I don\u2019t know how you do that now.\u201d Cuomo says he did not discuss a potential \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut when he spoke with President Trump earlier today. \u201cI haven\u2019t had those conversations,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d His response to a follow-up question about Trump\u2019s proposed quarantine on the North Lawn: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means. I don\u2019t know how that could be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view I don\u2019t know what you would be accomplishing. But I can tell you I don\u2019t even like the sound of it. Not even understanding what it is, I don\u2019t even like the sound of it.\u201d He adds: \u201cMandatory quarantine is a scary concept because it sounds like you\u2019re saying to people: \u2018You can\u2019t leave this district.\u2019\u201d In New York, Cuomo is now being asked about Trump\u2019s remarks. He spoke to the president \u201cabout the ship coming up and the four sites\u201d, he says, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him about any quarantine.\u201d More from the White House pool about Trump\u2019s remarks during his trip to Norfolk, Virginia about a potential quarantine for New York and neighbouring states: President Trump touched down at Joint Base Andrews at 12.33pm. He answered questions on the possible quarantine. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it,\u201d he said on quarantine of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. \u201cNo we wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d when asked about closing the New York City subway. He said he would talk to Governor Andrew Cuomo later today. Pool reporter Emily Goodin of the Daily Mail adds: \u201cPlease note there is a limited pool of seven traveling with [Trump] so we can employ safe social distancing practices with an empty seat in between each of us on the plane. Additionally, the pool underwent a temperature check \u2026 before boarding.\u201d Cuomo says they can\u2019t have a scenario where states are competing against each other for equipment like ventilators. He suggests the federal government could act as a single purchasing agent and distribute the equipment to the states \u2013 or the states could set up a consortium on their own. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a situation where 50 states are competing for the same essential equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not the way to do business. We need a nationwide buying consortium. ... This is something that needs to be worked out, not just for this but for the future.\u201d Here\u2019s the White House pool report on what Trump said just now: We\u2019d like to see NY quarantined because it\u2019s a hotspot \u2013 New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I\u2019m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there\u2019s a possibility that sometime today we\u2019ll do a quarantine \u2013 short-term two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.\u201d The report adds that Trump\u2019s helicopter departed for his trip to Norfolk, Virginia with new chief of staff Mark Meadows also on board. Cuomo says there are 7,328 people who have been hospitalized with 1,755 people in ICUs, but notes that daily hospitalizations and ICU admissions went down yesterday. The bad news: total deaths in New York are up to 728 from 519 yesterday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in any one number. The overall trend is still up,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cThe numbers drive the policy.\u201d He also says New York\u2019s department of health will begin a new test to see if individuals who were infected with coronavirus developed antibodies to the disease, saying: \u201cIt could be a big breakthrough\u201d While Andrew Cuomo speaks in New York, Donald Trump has been speaking about New York, in Washington: According to Idrees Ali of Reuters, the president also said \u201cquarantine would also be considered on New Jersey and Connecticut, would rather not do it but may need it\u201d. Cuomo hasn\u2019t mentioned possible quarantine of New York yet. The president is due in Norfolk, Virginia later, for the departure of the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship destined for New York harbour. Cuomo told his press conference he had spoken to the president today, and Trump had approved four more emergency hospital facilities like the one built at the Javits Center in Manhattan by the Army Corps of Engineers and the national guard, which Cuomo said will open on Monday. The new facilities will be built in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Cuomo says the federal government has authorized four more field hospitals with a total capacity of 4,000 additional beds. They will be located in the four outer boroughs of Brooklyn (the Cruise Ship Terminal), Queens (the Aqueduct Racetrack), Staten Island (CUNY Staten Island) and the Bronx (the NY Expo Center). He adds there will be a shift to coronavirus-only hospitals to further limit the risk of spread. \u201cThis is smart and we\u2019re going to isolate 600 beds for just this treatment,\u201d he says. Also, the New York state presidential primary scheduled for April 28 has been re-scheduled for 23 June. Cuomo says that local hospitals statewide must stop operating as individual institutions and start cooperating to help deal with the anticipated rush. \u201cWe need the local health systems to think more holistically,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can have a single hospital get overwhelmed within that system. ... The local health systems have to change their orientation where it\u2019s not hospital by hospital, which is the normal culture.\u201d If downstate hospitals become overwhelmed, those patients may be moved upstate. He adds: \u201cPatients can and should be moved among those local hospitals as the need requires. staff can and should be moved among those local hospitals as the circumstances require.\u201d Cuomo is showing off a bag-valve mask, a manual ventilator that helps people breathe. The National Guard is being trained to manually operate them, but it\u2019s anything but optimal. \u201cIf we have to turn to this device on any large-scale basis, that is not an acceptable situation,\u201d he says. \u201cShort answer: No, thank you.\u201d He says there are 4,000 ventilators from the federal government are in the stockpile, meaning a big shortfall must be made up in the 14 to 21 days before the apex. He says the ventilators were $25,000 apiece when the state began buying, but they\u2019re up to $45,000 today due to the demand. And because the state is approximately $15bn in debt, there is \u201cno interest in inflating the number of ventilators than we actually need\u201d. New York governor Andrew Cuomo starts off his daily briefing saying he only knew it was Saturday because it said so on his alarm clock: \u201cIt\u2019s literally like one day blending into the other.\u201d He points out that China\u2019s first Covid-19 case was 12 weeks ago, New York\u2019s first case was on 1 March, and that city schools closed only 10 days ago. \u201cKeep it all in perspective in this disorienting time,\u201d he says. From police roadblocks in the Florida Keys, national guard troops knocking on doors in Rhode Island in attempt to \u201chunt down\u201d New Yorkers, and city leaders nationwide threatening fines for residents found out in the open, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on personal freedoms was becoming clearer on Saturday, as the death toll continued to rise. Measures in Rhode Island attracted harsh words from the American Civil Liberties Union, which criticized what it saw as the \u201cblunderbuss approach\u201d of state troopers stopping vehicles from New York and ordering occupants into quarantine. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, New York state led the nation with more than 46,000 confirmed cases by Saturday morning, compared to Rhode Island\u2019s 203. \u201cUnder the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate simply does not, and cannot, constitute probable cause to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be,\u201d Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island\u2019s ACLU chapter, said in a statement. \u201cThe ACLU recognizes that strong measures are needed to address the public health crisis but giving the state police the power to stop \u2026 cars that are merely traveling through the state is a blunderbuss approach that cannot be justified in light of its substantial impact on civil liberties.\u201d Gina Raimondo, the Rhode Island governor, implemented the policy in a two-pronged attempt to keep out or contain visitors from New York. Another controversial measure saw the national guard, in the words of the New York Post, \u201chunting down\u201d New Yorkers by going door to door, beginning on Saturday. Any found would be ordered into a 14-day quarantine and face fines or jail time for refusing to comply. \u201cRight now we have a pinpointed risk. That risk is New York City,\u201d Raidondo said in a press conference on Friday. New Yorkers are personae non gratae in other areas of the country, too, with governors in Florida, Maryland, South Carolina and Texas imposing quarantine restrictions. They are also not wanted out of doors in their own city, Mayor Bill De Blasio threatening fines of $500 for groups congregating in parks or places of worship. Meanwhile in the Florida Keys, state law enforcement officials set up roadblocks this weekend at the top of the 125-mile island chain, to stop non-residents getting in. \u201cAs much as we love our visitors, we\u2019d like them to stay away until we can get this thing under control. These are extraordinary times, not just here but globally,\u201d Heather Carruthers, the Monroe county mayor, told reporters. Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan following his public back-and-forth with state governor Gretchen Whitmer over the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic. More than 3,600 people in Michigan have been confirmed to have Covid-19 with at least 92 dead, mostly from the three counties in the Detroit metro area. A Huffington Post feature published Friday took a hard look at how America\u2019s poorest big city is uniquely unprepared for what\u2019s ahead. Detroit\u2019s deep poverty makes it especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak and the economic damage it has already inflicted, presenting the city\u2019s public health system with a daunting challenge in slowing the pandemic. \u201cWhere you have generations of concentrated poverty and social determinants of health, when you have pandemics like this, it is going to hit those places harder,\u201d Michigan\u2019s Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said at a Thursday press conference. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has increased faster here than they did earlier in epicenters like New York City and Seattle. And Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and nearby suburbs, has the seventh-highest total of confirmed cases in the country, just behind Seattle\u2019s King County. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) last week issued a shelter-in-place order through April 13 as the disease rapidly spread. In Detroit, a history of poor public policy decisions is behind the systemic poverty that has made folks in the city \u201cso much more susceptible,\u201d said former Detroit Health Department Director Abdul El-Sayed. \u201cWhen you talk about any epidemic, it\u2019s not enough to look at the virus or pathogen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to look at the host and environment, and in Detroit you have hosts who are, for many reasons outside of their control, systematically less healthy, in general.\u201d We\u2019re awaiting New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing from Albany. As the US has surpassed Italy and China to become the country with the world\u2019s most known cases of coronavirus \u2013 104,713 as of this morning \u2013 nearly half of those (46,094) have been recorded in New York. And while the rate of new cases may be slowing, Cuomo said yesterday that he expects the demand for hospitalization to peak in 21 days and the state is creating a stockpile of medical equipment in preparation for that \u201capex\u201d accordingly. Former New York mayor and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani fired off a tweet on Friday that included misinformation about potential Covid-19 treatment and Michigan governor Gretcher Whitmer \u2013 and was subsequently deleted by the social media platform for violating its rules, Mediaite reports. Giuliani, a key player in an impeachment drama that ended in Trump\u2019s acquittal only last month but can now seem an event from the distant past, tweeted that \u201chydroxychloroquine has been shown to have a %100 effective rate treating Covid-19 Yet Democrat Gretchen Whitmer is threatening doctors who prescribe it.\u201d The tweet was comprised of \u201cdirect quotes\u201d from Charlie Kirk, an avowed Trump booster, Mediate noted, adding that the page which once held Giuliani\u2019s tweet now states: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d Kirk\u2019s tweet was similarly axed. Giuliani and Kirk\u2019s promotion of hydroxychloroquine is not out of the blue: it\u2019s one of several drugs Trump has touted as possible coronavirus treatments, without support from public health officials. \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try,\u201d Trump has said of the common anti-malaria medication. He has also maintained that the drug, taken in combination with popular antibiotic azithromycin, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. Dr Anthony Fauci, Trump\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser, was one of the public health experts who contradicted such claims, warning there was mere \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d of efficacy. In Arizona, a man died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, a chemical used in the cleaning of fish tanks that is also in hydroxychloroquine. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the man\u2019s widow told NBC, advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d Donald Trump has not attacked New York governor Andrew Cuomo much recently, certainly in comparison to Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Jay Inslee of Washington, Democrats leading other states with severe coronavirus problems. But the New York governor\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, has attacked Trump. On Friday night the CNN host slammed the president\u2019s response to the coronavirus, saying Trump\u2019s personality traits \u201care literally making us sick\u201d: If the federal government and the states don\u2019t get it together better, you will see sickness and death in this country like you never have before. And while there are a growing number of mayors and governors in need, there is one persistent problem at the top: Trump. His two defining flaws are on flagrant display. They are literally making us sick.\u201d Cuomo said Trump\u2019s \u201cignorance\u201d and \u201carrogance\u201d \u2013 including his statement that \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators\u201d \u2013 stood at odds with communities needs in fighting this outbreak. He doesn\u2019t \u2018believe.\u2019 What about this. When you go to war, do you give troops what they need before they come under fire? Yes, right? Same with healthcare workers. They need the PPE [personal protective equipment] now. They need the ventilators in their localities now so when they run out of either, there are more at the ready. Either he doesn\u2019t get that, which speaks to a degree of ignorance that is more threatening anything Covid-19 can do, or it is just his second defining flaw on display, his arrogance.\u201d Cuomo also criticized Trump\u2019s comments about governors during his White House coronavirus briefing Friday, when Trump said: \u201cI want them to be appreciative \u2026 if they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u201d The younger Cuomo said: No, you treat them right. Our money, our government, our power. We gave it to you. We don\u2019t serve you. You serve us.\u201d One would expect Trump to hit back \u2013 he regularly criticises the CNN host and has employed \u201cFredo\u201d, after the ineffective and doomed younger Corleone brother played by John Cazale in the Godfather movies, as an abusive nickname. The former Republican senator Tom Coburn has died at 72, according to a newspaper in his native Oklahoma. The Oklahoman published a statement from the senator\u2019s family and said he died after \u201ca long fight with prostate cancer\u201d. Coburn, the paper said: Served in the Senate from 2005 to 2015 and in the US House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. After leaving the Senate, he pushed for a constitutional convention and advocated for a range of conservative fiscal causes. Coburn was a doctor who resigned his Senate seat following his cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about my health, my prognosis or even my hopes and desires,\u201d he said then. \u201cAs a citizen, I am now convinced that I can best serve my own children and grandchildren by shifting my focus elsewhere.\u201d One such effort was in support of rightwing efforts to call a Constitutional Convention, in an attempt to dramatically restrict the powers of the US federal government. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for the future of our country,\u201d Coburn told the annual convention of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) in New Orleans in August 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re either going to become a socialist, Marxist country like western Europe, or we\u2019re going to be free. As far as me and my family and my guns, I\u2019m going to be free.\u201d Coburn died as Congress passed and Donald Trump signed the $2.2tn CARES Act, a huge stimulus bill aimed at bailing out US businesses and tax payers during the economic crash caused by the coronavirus outbreak. According to a friend quoted by the Oklahoman on Saturday, the former senator was \u201cfighting up to the very end. He was fighting for all of the things he still believed in.\u201d Among Trump\u2019s tweets on Friday night were retweets in support of Trish Regan, a TV host who left Fox Business after saying Democrats were using the coronavirus outbreak in their attempts to bring the president down. \u201cCan\u2019t say enough wonderful things about [Trish Regan],\u201d read one missive retweeted by Trump, calling her \u201cone of the few conservatives in cable television \u2026 a great patriot and great friend\u201d. Another, tweeting a story from the far-right site Gateway Pundit, was headlined: \u201cFOX Business Network Fires [Regan] for Telling the Truth About How Liberal Media Was Using Coronavirus to Take Down Trump.\u201d Here\u2019s how we reported Regan\u2019s original comments: According to CNN media reporter and host Brian Stelter, meanwhile, \u201cit should be noted that Regan\u2019s commentary, while reprehensible, wasn\u2019t much different than what Fox\u2019s main stars were saying. Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, as I previously reported, both downplayed the virus and suggested it was being used by the media to \u2018bludgeon\u2019 Trump.\u201d Trump himself regularly complains about Democrats allegedly politicising the coronavirus outbreak. Perhaps, then, Regan was more vulnerable simply because she was not so big a name in the Fox News and Business firmament. After all, Hannity has a direct line to the president: Good morning, and welcome to another day of Guardian coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Donald Trump was up early on Saturday, tweeting complaints about \u201cthe Lamestream media\u201d. Various stories have got the president\u2019s goat, including one which said he has consulted New York Yankees star, drugs cheat and partner of Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez about how to tackle the crisis. ABC News put that one down to \u201cmultiple sources\u201d. The president said: \u201cWhen you see, \u2018five sources say\u2019, don\u2019t believe the story\u2026\u201d So that was fun. Trump has also been pursuing attacks on governors he doesn\u2019t like, particularly Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat he claimed with no discernible irony was \u201cway in over her head\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue\u201d and \u201clikes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude!\u201d Trump does have official business to attend to on Saturday, traveling to Norfolk, Virginia to deliver remarks as the USNS Comfort hospital ship sets sail for New York harbour. At the White House briefing on Friday, the 73-year-old president was asked: \u201cGiven that older Americans are advised to stay at home and avoid travel, is it absolutely necessary for you to go to Norfolk, Virginia tomorrow to wave goodbye to the ship?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Trump answered, \u201cbut I have spirit for the country.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s great if I go to Virginia,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a tiny trip. And I think it\u2019s a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be hugging people and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to be shaking people\u2019s hands and everything, but I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, we\u2019ll be careful.\u201d Trump is due to leave the White House at midday, perhaps a first chance to pass comment on new developments in the crisis. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, as of Saturday morning more than 100,000 US cases had been confirmed and 1,541 people had died. Nearly 45,000 of those cases and more than 500 of those deaths happened in New York state. Expect to hear more from Governor Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat widely said to be having a \u201cgood crisis\u201d as a leader, later. Bryan Armen Graham will be here soon to take you through the day.
