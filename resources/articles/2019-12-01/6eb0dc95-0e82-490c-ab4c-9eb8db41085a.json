Arsenal remain unflustered about the idea of Ljungberg continuing in his interim role indefinitely, a state of affairs that was helped by their 3-1 win at West Ham in his third game in charge on Monday night. While names such as Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 mentioned in connection with the job after his sacking by Napoli on Tuesday night \u2013 hold popular allure, the club\u2019s priority is to make the right appointment and they retain confidence in the Swede\u2019s ability to stabilise a tumultuous season while they take their time compiling a shortlist. Although it is understood Ljungberg would like to take over on a permanent basis he has been inscrutable on the subject in public since being asked to step in last month. Asked whether he saw himself as a contender he reiterated that he is only looking as far as the next match, which takes place tonight against Standard Li\u00e8ge in the final round of Europa League group stage fixtures. \u201cThat\u2019s not a conversation I\u2019ve had with the bosses,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to go from day to day, game to game, to try to help this fantastic club. That\u2019s what I try to do. All of those decisions are up to the top dogs.\u201d Ljungberg struck a similarly diplomatic tone, albeit with a hint of frustration, when he was asked specifically about the availability of Ancelotti and the former Chelsea manager\u2019s potential suitability for the role. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked this question a lot since I took over and I just try to concentrate on my job \u2013 that is to win football games and get us to play better football. What the club decides to do or who they choose it is totally up to them but I stay totally out of it.\u201d That victory at the London Stadium, earned with three goals in nine second-half minutes, was a release after nine games without a win, Arsenal\u2019s worst run in 42 years. Ljungberg admitted his players had looked tense before that and, adapting a phrase beloved of his old manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, hailed their bold approach in brushing West Ham aside. \u201cYou have to relax, dare to be football players, be brave,\u201d he said. \u201cThey let that handbrake go and all of a sudden they played really good football.\u201d A performance of basic competence in Belgium would be enough to put them in the last 32 of the Europa League, given that only a five-goal margin of defeat could jeopardise their continued interest. In contrast with Emery, Ljungberg chose not to sanction the release of Arsenal\u2019s squad list in advance of the game. But he has a number of selection headaches and was dealt a significant blow earlier in the day when the club confirmed Kieran Tierney, who dislocated his shoulder at West Ham, will miss the next three months. Granit Xhaka will also miss the match after a concussion on Monday, and will not return until after Sunday\u2019s league meeting with Manchester City. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 is absent with a knee issue and Hector Beller\u00edn\u2019s hamstring problem keeps him on the sidelines. \u201cOne of those freak things,\u201d Ljungberg said of the injury list. \u201cI try to see what players can do and not focus on what they cannot do,\u201d Ljungberg said in what appears a fundamental tenet of his managerial approach. He may choose to assess the teenage defender Zach Medley, who is yet to play this season, while Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith-Rowe are among other fringe players likely to receive extended playing time. Arsenal (4-2-3-1): (Probable): Mart\u00ednez; Maitland-Niles, Chambers, David Luiz, Medley; Guendouzi, Willock; Nelson, Smith Rowe, Saka; Lacazette. Standard (4-2-3-1): (Probable): Bodart; Fai, Vanheusden, Laifis, Gavory; Cimirot, Bastien; Amallah, Mpoku, Carcela; Avenatti."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
