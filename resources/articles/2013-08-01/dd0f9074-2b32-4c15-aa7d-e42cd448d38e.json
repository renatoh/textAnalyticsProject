Thirty more cronies and party donors, leavened by a handful of the genuinely worthy and the downright eccentric (what's an active journalist like Danny Finkelstein doing on the list?), appointed to the democratic world's largest legislative chamber. It's hard to imagine where they'll find room to sit, never mind a job to do, in a chamber where in some debates there's a 90-second limit on speeches. Yet proposals for reform are discarded. Even a modest suggestion of voluntary retirement founders. And prime ministerial patronage continues more or less unchecked. The whole exercise is, in the widest sense of the word, corrupt: a system where individuals who make huge party political donations and \u2013 however sound their judgment and broad their experience \u2013 are awarded a place in the legislature as a gift from the leader of the party is just as much a scandal waiting to happen now as it was when Maundy Gregory was operating the system in the interests of Lloyd George. It's potentially venal, and it's constitutionally enfeebling. There are now 785 members of the House of Lords and another 53 either on leave of absence or suspended, a new 21st-century record. That's 172 more peers than in the year 2000. If all the new appointees attend for 300 days a year they'll be able to claim more than \u00a340,000 each in attendance allowance (that's before they start claiming expenses) which adds up to \u00a31.2m a year. However, as some of them are very rich indeed \u2013 according to the Forbes rich list, the new Lord Bamford, JCB digger tycoon and Tory donor, is worth more than \u00a32.5bn \u2013 perhaps some of them will let the expenses go. If the appointments system continues like this, the Lords will soon rival the Chinese People's Assembly. No one thinks this is a sensible way to proceed. Yet despite its Ruritanian appointments process, the Lords is generally acknowledged to be working unexpectedly effectively. Peers do take seriously their duty to scrutinise legislation, they have a good record for improving it, and some have been doughty defenders of individual freedoms. And look closely at who actually sits in the Lords: since the hereditaries were largely ejected in 1999, it's become a more representative cross-section of the electorate \u2013 and the share of the votes cast \u2013 than the Commons, and more ethnically diverse. Even the gender balance is at least no worse. The danger is that the more useful it is, the harder it will become to reform. If the negotiations on party funding had not been cynically halted by the Tories just when circumstances seemed, at last, auspicious, the patronage-based system of appointment might at least have felt a little less tawdry. Now nothing is likely to happen this side of the election. Under the radar, however, sensible conversations are taking place in front of the Commons constitution committee. In June the constitution unit, main supplier of rational contributions to the debate, set out some thoughts about incremental rather than big-bang reforms. Small is beautiful, they argue, or at least more acceptable. The biggest hurdle is probably the first: agreement in principle on the size of the Lords (they suggest 650) and on the precise relationship between the politics of the peers, the results of the most recent general election, and the shape of the Commons. Once that's agreed, the next step would be to cut the overall size of the Lords by insisting that for every new peer in, two old ones should leave. They want a strengthened appointments commission with the power to police the composition of the Lords, and an end to the prime ministerial power to appoint just as many peers as they want. No one supposed, in 1999, that removing the hereditary peers was where reform would end. But since then, the next step has invariably been too much for some and not enough for others. So without abandoning the ambition for an elected upper chamber, perhaps it is time to make progress in smaller steps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
