It should be a corker too. The gamboling dewy-eyed colts of the Arsenal fame academy versus the ageing, world-weary, shirt-tugging, cheating etc etc old lags of the Milan Saga Holidays club. Or so my NUJ handbook of lazy Big European Night football clich\u00e9s would have you believe. It does at least like they both might have a bit of a go tonight. \"For me, the most important thing is to play without the handbrake,\" Arsene mused on this morning's back pages, before adding \"we must really go for it and play with freedom,\" clenching his fist and punching the air just to make sure we got his point. Milan have also been making noises about attacking and scoring away goals and always having the second leg in the bag. So you never know. Either way, this is a clash of current European heavyweights. Arsenal are unbeaten in 19 European home games. And they've never been knocked out of any European competition by an Italian club. Milan, meanwhile, have scored in their last 12 Euro matches. Clarence Seedorf is making his 130th European appearance. Really. On the other hand, they are 21 points off (cue collective Milan yawn) Serie A top spot. Plenty in the tank then. The sly old dogs. Here they are, then. Our teams tonight: Arsenal: Lehmann, Sagna, Toure, Gallas, Clichy, Eboue, Flamini, Fabregas, Hleb, Adebayor, Eduardo. Subs: Fabianski, Senderos, Denilson, Silva, Bendtner, Justin Hoyte, Walcott. AC Milan: Kalac, Oddo, Nesta, Maldini, Kaladze, Pirlo, Gattuso, Kaka, Seedorf, Ambrosini, Alexandre Pato. Subs: Fiori, Emerson, Inzaghi, Gilardino, Jankulovski, Bonera, Brocchi. Referee: Claus Bo Larsen (Denmark) Looks like pretty much the Arsenal team you would have expected. Bendtner and Walcott on the bench if they need to change the game or perhaps even (ahem) score a goal. Maldini wasn't sure to start for Milan, but there he is, five Big Cups to his name and all. Even more exciting, Pato - latest 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid - also starts. A bit tasty in front of goal apparently. It does look a very strong team, you have to say. Maldini, incidentally, is 40 in the summer. Also, Jeff Stelling seems to think Pato is pronounced \"Pay-toe\". He keeps saying it, like he knows something we don't. So maybe he's right. On the email Chris Oquendo says \"Milan = Liverpool?? I mean they both $uck in their domestic league, they both do well in Champions League and they both had great midfielders in Kaka and Ger...oh eh nevermind!\" An interesting observation on domestic alienation in an increasingly global game, Chris. But as you say, never mind. Anthony Paige asks \"how long before we see some classic Italian prima donna pirouetting, fantastic flops, and excruciating facial grimaces?\" Oh dear. Let's hope not. This is The Guardian, Anthony. We rise above such national stereotypes. Even when it comes to cheating, diving wo....oooah. They're out on the pitch listening to the \"THE CHUMP-YAWNS!!!\" music. Maldini doesn't look a day over 35. What's he using? 1min: And they're off! Milan kick off and immediately launch an attack down the left. Ball out for a goqal kick. 2 min: Milan looking smooth early on. Maldini is at left back today and not in the centre. Wonder why. Eboue up against him. 4 min: Arsenal's first proper attack. Long ball to Adebayor followed by some nice zippy passes, but eventually put behind by Hleb. Milan look pretty well organised at the back. 5 min: Pato! Finds a bit of space and fires in a shot from 20 yards that deflects behind for a corner. Much worse, Toure is limping off. 6 min: Lehmann! Catches the corner and hurls the ball 60 yards to Adebayor, pursued by five defenders. Arsenal corner, but Adebayor kicks Kaladze in the head and it's a free kick. 7 min: Senderos on for Toure. Bit of a blow this. 9 min: Long ball to Adebayor. Brilliant control and plays in Eboue on the right. Decent cross but Adebayor's header is easily saved. Some sneaky leaning-in-style defending from Nesta there. 11 min: Eduardo is playing on the left by the way. Adebayor up on his own. 12min: Nice spell of possession from Arsenal. Adebayor looks well up for this. Maldini dives in on Eboue. Corner. 13 min: Corner just evades Senderos and is hacked clear. Arsenal are getting very close to Pirlo tonight. Hleb disposesses him and sets up Sagna, but his cross evades Eduardo. 14 min: Pato takes a pass from Kaka and glides past two defenders. He's a lovely mover. Actually quite similar to Kaka at first glance. 16 min: Some cagey stuff out there. Arsenal working very hard when Milan have the ball. Still no real chances yet. 18 min: Pato/Pay-toe update: Steve Wingrove in Brazil says that Pato is pronounced \"just as is old-school reggae artist Pato Banton's name\". Well that clears it up. Have some of that Stelling. 19 min: Adebayor takes a long pass and lines up a shot, but the ball is deflected behind for another corner. Eduardo's kick is easily taken by the keeper. Waste that. 21 min: Adebayor again one on one with Nesta. This is a great battle. Adebayor shoves him about a bit and wins a corner again. This time it lands on itsy-bitsy Cesc Fabregas' head but he manages to glance it towards the corner flag. Not a bad opening. 23 min: Arsenal bossing the possession here but trying to pass your way through Milan is a bit like running through glue. Still,a good spell for the Gunners. 25 min: Ancelloti's up on the touchline doing some pointing. 26 min: Long-ball merchants Arsenal again hoof it up to Adebayor. He sprints on to the ball and blasts a shot over the bar. Well, it's working quite well so far. 28 min: Oddo barges past Clichy by the byeline and cuts it back ot the egde of the box. Brave block on the shot by Senderos. Ominous moment for Milan. 30 min: Ah ha. Gattuso rolls around on the floor for a bit after being mildly scuffed by Hleb's toe. Good news: he's all right. But he looks cross. 31 min: The Emirates seems very loud tonight. Odd because it's a very cagey kind of affair on the pitch. 33 min: Decent ball in from the right wing by Sagna. Misses everyone though. Then Milan rush down the other end and Lehmann has to rush out to gather. Weirdly, Pato gets booked for pushing over Sagna. Lehmann, suprise,surprise, has a few words on that one. 35 min: Arsenal free kick in a dangerous area on the right. Fabregas swings it in, but ends up being hoofed over from a tight angle by Senderos. You have to say, Adebayor is winning everything his way in the air. 37 min: Best chance of the night and Arsenal's first shot on target. Eboue does Maldini brilliantly by the touchline. Cuts it back to Hleb who shoots but straight at the keeper. 39 min: In early from Clichy, Adebayor wins it again but heads wide. All very well but Eduardo is out on the left and no one else is close enough to latch on to it. 41 min: All a bit cagey and tight. It's a game of chess out there. On grass. With men. And a ball. 42 min: Another good cross in from Sagna, but Arsenal don't have the numbers there again. Milan on the other hand have done nothing going forward....Ooooh. Eduardo almost played in by Fabregas. Good spell for Arsenal this. 44 min: Brilliant play by Arsenal down the left through Eduardo and Flamini. Cross blocked but Pirlo dived in on Flamini and there were shouts for a penalty. That was slinky stuff out by the touchline. Arsenal are keeping the pressure up. 45+1 min: Half time. And it ends with Arsenal on the attack. They have at least tried to make somehting happen. Milan have done little more than defend well, chug about in midfield and look like the whole thing's all just a bit of a stroll. Oddly, Maldini has looked the weak link, lots of attacks down his side. Both sides will be happy enough for now. Pato update: Conor Brennan asks \"Not being a reggae aficionado, how does one pronounce the Pato in Pato Banton's name?\". It's \"Patto\", I believe. Like Statto. And don't ask about that one. On a similar theme somebody called ClassicNo4 asks \"Does Jeff Stelling wear a Toe-pay?\" Yes. Very good. And Amir Adhamy writes to say he's off to the Brits after party. Well la-di-da. Well, a cagey, tight, no-quarter-asked-none-given affair for most of the half. Just the odd moment of excitement when Adebayor has managed to get Nesta isolated. Milan certainly don't muck about. 46 min: No changes on either side and they're off. 46 min: Official word is Kolo toure is suffering from calf knack 47 min: Lots of possession for Milan early doors. But nothing too forward looking yet. 48 min: Great battling from Adebayor. Wins a corner off Oddo. 49 min: Nesta's limping off. Looks a bit iffy. He's holding his groin. 50 min: Kaka almost scores an own goal from the corner. Very close. Headed just wide. Keeper catches the second kick. Jankulovski comes on for Nesta. Maldini goes into the middle. 52 min: Clever ball down the channel for Kaka. He stretches past Senderos and hooks a cross over Lehmann's head. Ball bounces along the goal line for a second. Cleared and Arsenal hook it down the other end where Hleb feeds Eboue but he pulls his shot just wide. Fantastic break. 53 min: Adebayor puts it in the net but he's offside. Nice little move. Well off in the end. Better stuff this half though. 55 min: Kalac makes a really brave save at Adebayor's feet. Lovely dinked ball in from Fabregas. He's starting to get on the ball a lot more. 56 min: Milan give the ball away. Fabregas feeds Eduardo and he shoots powerfully just over from outside the box. More pressure. Decent hit too. 57 min: Lovely bit of skill from Clichy, dancing round Oddo. Arsenal passing it about lovely but not really getting a shot in when they could have. 59 min: Another terrible pass from Maldini. Arsenal attack down the right. They' re dominating here. They'll be hoping to make it count. 60 min: Pato just made up about ten yards sprinting against Gallas. Ends with an easy catch for Lehmann. But The Duck is quick. 63 min: Clear chance for Oddo. Played in by Kaka's pass, acres of space on the right, but balloons his shot wide. That was a really decent opening. 64 min: Another early punt towards Adebayor almost slips him in front of goal. Still odd seeing Arsenal play like that. But they do look dangerous with it. 66 min: Kaka much more in this now. Runs 30 yards with the ball and almost gets Pato in on goal. He's a slippery customer all right. 68 min: Pirlo in a lot of space near the corner flag, swings in a cross that Senderos heads clear. Milan are creeping back into it. 70 min: Senderos booked for a foul on Kaka in the centre circle. Bit harsh that. 70 min: Told you. Kaka has a shot that skews wide after Pato's lay-off. Arsenal decide to keep the ball for a bit. Good idea. 71 min: Worrying times for Arsenal here. A horrible scrum in their box ends up with Pato hacking it wide. Lots of white shirts forward there. Arsenal need to get themselves going again. 73 min: All Milan now. Lots of good if slow possession. Wonder if Wenger might change it. Theo Walcott anyone? 74 min: No, it's Bendtner, on for Eduardo, whose last act is to slice a shot horribly wide. Two big lads up front now for the long ball boys. 75 min: Fabregas gallops through the middle and shoots low. Kalac saves. Fabregas has had a really good game here against a quality midfield. 76 min: Bendtner romps away like a young colt and is eventually run off the ball by Maldini. Didn't pass to Adebayor when he might have. Boys, boys. Play nicely. 78 min: Pato takes his laid back reggae grooves off to the dressing room. Looks like he's got cramp. Gilardino on. 79 min:Ball in from Eboue. Caught by the giant Kalac again. Arsenal need a break here. This is a very solid defence. 81 min: Oh dear. Eboue booked for diving in the area after skipping round Jankulovski. There was a bit of contact but he went down very dramatically. Meanwhile brilliant recovery tackle from Senderos on Kaka in the Arsenal box. Needed that. 83 min:Fabregas works some space and shoots from the edge of the box. Caught it well but easily saved. Plenty of shots from Arsenal this half. Nothing really threatening though. 84min: Couple of dangerous crosses pinged across the Milan area. Bendtner and Adebayor get in each others' way. Ends in a corner which is hacked clear. Pressure but not much there in the end. 86 min: Seedorf off, Emerson on. One old midfield bloke for another. 87 min: Milan corner taken by Pirlo and Gilardino finds space at the near post. Lehmann saves. Dicey moment that right near the end. 88 min: Milan plenty of possession here. Arsenal need to keep their minds on the job. 88 min: Perhaps Arsenal's best chance after a lightening break. Hleb played in by Eboue. Lays it back to Bendtner, who thrashes it miles over the bar from a tough angle. Walcott on right at the death. 90 min: Pirlo has his second attacking free kick in a couple of minutes: both punted hopelessly into the crowd. Not what you expect. 90+2 min: Arsenal corner. Can they snatch it? 90+2 min: No. Ball falls to Walcott who gets a decent strike in but right at the keeper. 90+3 min: Ancellotti grinning on the touchline. You have to say, it's been a bit of a classic away performance. Very tight. 90+4 min: But wait! Brilliant jinking wing play from Walcott, great cross and Adebayor HEADS AGAINST THE CROSS BAR from six yards. He was already celebrating. 90+4 min: Full time almost immediately. What a close run thing for Arsenal at the end. Would have been a very different night for them. As it is, predictably well organised and mature performance from Milan. Arsenal had a lot of the ball and attacked at pace, but on the whole a bit like banging your head against the wall. That's all from me for now. Hope you enjoyed the commentary and thanks for all your emails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
