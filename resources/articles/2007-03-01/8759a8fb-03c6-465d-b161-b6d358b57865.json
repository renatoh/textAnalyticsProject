Already contending with poverty, rats, vicious gangs, crack dealers, overburdened social workers, emotionally blunted cops and inept parents who are only slightly older than themselves, inner city kids in contemporary films are increasingly confronted by messianic white teachers with fabulous cheekbones who have selflessly volunteered to sacrifice everything in order to improve the lives of their charges. The most recent example of this trend is Freedom Writers; where the pre-emptively beatified Hilary Swank not only gives up her time to teach her students; not only sacrifices her marriage; but even dips into her savings to buy supplies for the foul-mouthed ingrates. Greater love than this no woman hath. Faced with such bellicose altruism, slum-dwelling kids find themselves at a bit of a disadvantage. As if the one-two punch of poverty and ignorance had not made things bad enough, schoolchildren now must deal with celestial interlopers who will briefly alight in the miasmic urban squalor and bring peace, love and understanding into their pathetic little lives. They will do this not by teaching youngsters a skill that might be useful somewhere down the road - like, say, how to count - but by instructing them in the fine art of ballroom dancing (Take The Lead), or the influence of Hegelian dialectics on the evolution of modern thought (Half Nelson), or by apprising them of the difference between the poetry of Dylan Thomas and the poetry of Bob Dylan (Dangerous Minds). To which the ghetto kids cry out gratefully: \"And not a moment too soon!\" In each of these movies, students are seduced into improving their otherwise meaningless lives by some pedagogical flight of fancy that comes straight out of left field. The underlying premise is that if dysfunctional inner city children can only master ballroom dancing, they can master anything. So now the children, already crushed by life itself, find their emotional burden doubled. They must not only labour mightily to inject meaning into the own sad lives, but must also serve as moral hood ornaments for their benefactors, and never breathe a word that ballroom dancing and Depression-era Welsh poetry are not exactly what the doctor ordered. What's more, they must smile politely while Antonio Banderas teaches them the complicated dance steps in Take The Lead, pretending they can understand a single word he is saying as he blithely massacres the English language. In the past few months, Take The Lead, Half Nelson and Freedom Writers have all appeared in US movie theatres, and no one is quite sure why. While there been have a handful of successful - and even beloved - films centring around charismatic teachers, they are rarely set in the inner city, and are usually not set in America. Classic old British standbys include Goodbye Mr Chips and The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie. Their US counterparts are Dead Poets Society and The Emperor's Club. But these movies bear little relation to Freedom Writers, Half Nelson, Take The Lead and Dangerous Minds because none of the students are on crack or come to school with AK-47s. In private schools, whether in Britain or America, such behaviour is grounds for immediate dismissal. And while charismatic-teacher films like Educating Rita and To Sir, With Love are set in grittier surroundings, they too bear little resemblance to these more recent offerings. They lack the ambience of desperation, the students are not incipient psychopaths, the schools are crack-free. In fact, the film that comes closest to the mood of Freedom Writers and Take The Lead is the surprise 2004 French hit Les Choristes. This heartwarming affair tells the story of a hapless schoolteacher reduced to teaching antisocial orphans and uncooperative reform school students who finally wins them over by persuading them to join a choir. Indeed, the movie is told in flashback from the perspective of one of the teacher's grateful students, who has grown up to be a famous conductor. Because heartwarming French movies are regularly remade by Hollywood, it seems likely that we will eventually see a film in which a down-and-out music teacher rescues black inner city children from the abyss by inducing them to sing Monteverdi madrigals. Everyone knows that there is a template for genre films. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy seems to get girl back, then loses her again, boy defeats rival, boy and girl live happily ever after. Or: Villain starts on top, villain ends on bottom. Are there similar rules governing charismatic teacher films? Yes. These are the rules teachers must abide by in order to function effectively in such films. Deep-six the official curriculum because it is stupid and ignores the children's real needs. High school students don't need to know what Napoleon Bonaparte is famous for, or on which side of Iran they should look for Iraq on a map. What high school students need is to express themselves (Freedom Writers, Dangerous Minds, Les Choristes) or to learn dance steps in a non hip-hop idiom (Take The Lead). The hell with all that reading, writing, arithmetic stuff. Teach them morris dancing. Try to impress the kids with some skill you possess that they do not. Michelle Pfeiffer (Dangerous Minds) used the karate techniques she learned in the marine corps to win the kids over. At a pinch, you can always try ballroom dancing, but only if you promise to bring around a leggy blonde who does the tango in her underwear. Don't bother talking to the principal, because school administrators are insensitive idiots. The male lead in Dangerous Minds got shot to death after the principal threw him out of school for failing to knock at his office door. The headmaster in Les Choristes is a sadistic crook. The principal in Half Nelson insists that Ryan Gosling stick to the official curriculum, and is furious when he does not, though the fact that he keeps snorting cocaine on school grounds probably doesn't help their relationship. Appearance counts. Hilary Swank looks like a million bucks when she shows up in the hood in her resplendent red suit, black heels and snazzy pearls at the beginning of Freedom Writers. Pfeiffer wears cute skirts and divine little boots throughout Dangerous Minds. Antonio Banderas looks like he just stepped off the pages of GQ in Take The Lead; the first time we see him, he's in a tux. Only unkempt, unshaven, crackhead slacker Gosling refuses to spruce up in Half Nelson - and is it any wonder that neither the students nor the administration respect him? The foregoing explains how to succeed as a teacher in charismatic educator films. For a crash course in how not to succeed, take a peek at 187, a disturbing 1997 film starring Samuel L Jackson. At the beginning of the film, Jackson seems like just another altruistic inner city school teacher, working for peanuts in one of New York's most dangerous neighbourhoods. But after he is repeatedly stabbed by a disgruntled student, he rehabs, moves to California, and lands a job as a substitute science teacher in an even worse neighbourhood than back home. For a short while, 187 adheres to the classic template, and he seems to be making headway with his students. But then Jackson, who is anything but a charismatic white person, ruins everything by surreptitiously murdering one of his students, and chopping off the finger of another. C'mon, Samuel L. This may be a way to get the kids' attention, but it is not the way to win their affection and respect. Just ask Hilary Swank or Michelle Pfeiffer. \u00b7 Freedom Writers is out now, Half Nelson is out on April 20"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
