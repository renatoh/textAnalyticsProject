The further deterioration of negotiations over the funding lapse affecting nearly 800,000 federal employees came a day after the president used his first address from the Oval Office to reinforce his demands for a wall along the southern border with Mexico. \u201cJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time,\u201d Trump said on Twitter, referring to the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cI asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\u201d Schumer, offering his version of events, told reporters outside of the White House that \u201cthe president just got up and walked out\u201d. \u201cHe asked Speaker Pelosi: \u2018Will you agree to my wall?\u2019 She said no, and he just got up and said we have nothing to discuss and walked out,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAgain, we saw a temper-tantrum because he couldn\u2019t get his way.\u201d The meeting followed a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, during which Trump urged Republicans to \u201cstick together\u201d. A handful of Republicans have expressed concerns over the longevity of the shutdown. At least three Republican senators \u2013 Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 have said they would support reopening the government without funding for the wall. But emerging from the private meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump showed no sign of backing down while threatening to declare a national emergency if a breakthrough is not found. \u201cThe Republicans are totally unified,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe talked about strategy, but they\u2019re with us all the way.\u201d \u201cHe gave no indication of any willingness to budge an inch,\u201d said John Kennedy, a Republican of Louisiana. \u201cThe president \u2013 and I happen to agree with him \u2013 believes that his only sin is that for the first time in 15 or 20 years he is actually enforcing America\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d The shutdown, the third on Trump\u2019s watch, is the longest since 1995 and has forced the closure of national parks, placed certain food and drug inspections on hold, and sparked concerns over air travel. Before their meeting with Trump, Schumer and Pelosi held an event with furloughed federal workers in a bid to highlight the impact of the shutdown. \u201cTo use them as hostages through a temper tantrum by the president is just so wrong, so unfair, so mean-spirited,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt ought to end and it ought to end now.\u201d Trump offered no new solutions at a nationwide televised address on Tuesday evening, but instead insisted that a wall was necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigration. In a speech full of false claims and misleading statistics, Trump painted a portrait of a crisis at the US-Mexico border even as the rate of illegal immigration has steadily fallen over the years and in 2018 reached its lowest point in more than a decade. Talks have remained at a stalemate over the president\u2019s insistence that any government funding bill include $5.7bn toward the construction of a border wall. Democrats, newly in control of the House of Representatives, have said they will not allocate any money toward the wall, which remains a popular concept within Trump\u2019s base but has little support from the broader American public. Although he stopped short of declaring a \u201cnational emergency\u201d in his televised address, Trump insisted on Wednesday he had the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do so. \u201cI think we might work a deal, and if we don\u2019t, I may go that route,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cMy threshold will be if I can\u2019t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\u201d Asked about the federal workers who were going without pay, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re all going to get the money and I think they\u2019re going to be happy. \u201cMany of those people that you\u2019re talking about are on my side.\u201d There is no evidence to support the notion that federal workers support a border wall or Trump\u2019s position amid the shutdown. It is also not clear if those who were either working or furloughed without pay would eventually be compensated. Democrats, in a bid to amplify pressure on the White House and Senate Republicans, began a series of House votes on Wednesday to reopen the government one department at a time, beginning with passing a bill to reopen the Treasury, the Internal Revenue service and some other federal agencies. However, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has signaled the bills would hit a dead end in the upper chamber. \u201cWe are all behind the president,\u201d McConnell told reporters with Trump by his side. Without a resolution, the closure of several government operations could soon pose a threat to the delivery of food stamps and tax refunds for millions of Americans. Clifton Buchanan, a cook supervisor with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Houston, is among the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who have been furloughed since 21 December 2018, when parts of the government shut down. Buchanan, who participated in the press conference with Democrats, turned 50 on Friday. But instead of celebrating the milestone, he sat around the kitchen table with his wife discussing which bills they could afford to pay without his income. He said: \u201cRight now I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to pay my bills and feed my family. I\u2019m not working. I\u2019m not getting paid. I can\u2019t pick and choose who to blame. I just know I have no income.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
