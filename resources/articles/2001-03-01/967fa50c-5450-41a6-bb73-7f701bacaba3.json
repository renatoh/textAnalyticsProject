Launched in the run-up to Christmas, the campaign triggered a furious reaction from Shelter which warned that it risked labelling all homeless people as cheats and drug addicts. Critics of the Change A Life campaign will seize on the small amount raised as evidence that the attempt to dissuade the public from giving on the streets has backfired. The government's rough sleepers unit revealed yesterday that it had raised a fraction of what was spent in advertising. But a spokeswoman insisted that the main aim of the campaign had been to encourage volunteering and gifts in kind. \"It has raised \u00a310,000 in the first four months of a 12-month campaign, which is a lot of money considering it was not meant to be a fundraiser.\" The rough sleepers unit did not disclose yesterday how many people had volunteered - that figure will be revealed later this year - but the spokeswoman said the campaign had been \"inundated\" with offers of help. The posters feature beggars holding signs urging members of the public who \"really want to help\" to call Change A Life. Academics have expressed the fear that stopping giving money to beggars would lead to a rise in crime. In an open letter to Tony Blair, almost 60 social policy experts described the strategy as \"misguided\". Hartley Dean, professor of social policy at Luton University, said: \"I think in the week following Comic Relief there are some comparisons to be drawn. I would want to know what success they have had in terms of attracting volunteers, but in terms of cash donations it doesn't seem to be a proportionate investment. \"It is consistent with the evidence of local 'diverted giving' schemes. There was a scheme in Winchester, where the town council and main shopkeepers decided they didn't want beggars seen around the city centre, which raised quite a lot of money initially and then tapered off quite rapidly.\" The donations will be divided between Crisis, Centrepoint, the Salvation Army and the National Homeless Alliance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
