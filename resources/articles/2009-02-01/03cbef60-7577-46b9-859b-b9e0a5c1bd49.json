Historians chose Abraham Lincoln, who led America through the civil war, as the best president. Guardian readers may be dismayed to learn George Bush was not in last place (he was listed as seventh-worst). The dishonourable distinction went to James Buchanan, who failed to avert the civil war.

But he certainly ranks in the bottom 5."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
