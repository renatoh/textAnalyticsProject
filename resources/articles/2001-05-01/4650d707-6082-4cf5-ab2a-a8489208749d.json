The implication seemed to be that it was an unrealistic hope for a country whose aspirations have often outrun its competence. In France, of course, intermittent moods of self-aggrandisement contest with a more characteristic cynicism or materialism: it was Charles Lamb who, somewhat sourly, wrote: 'English physicians kill you; the French let you die.' But the question is worth asking after a week of manifestos: what are our ambitions? Politicians make their judgments as if we were largely selfish and material. Behind Sharron Stoner's dramatic confrontation with Tony Blair lay the question which he could hardly have asked in the circumstances: would you, and millions of others, pay more income tax to finance the improved facilities you demand? The answer people give to opinion polls is usually yes; the answer in the ballot box is somewhat different. Towards the end of the Seventies, it began to be obvious that income tax had a practical ceiling in the world of realpolitik. Not only would excessive rates be punished by the electorate, they would encourage evasion and avoidance. The move to regressive indirect taxation was, pace Mr Hague, begun under Mrs Thatcher. Denis Healey's ambition of squeezing the rich until the pips squeaked faded into the past along with Keynes, Hopalong Cassidy and his horse, Topper, and those beguilers of my youth, Hibs' Famous Five - Smith, Johnstone, Reilly, Turnbull and Ormond. Last week, when the funeral of Bobby Murdoch brought back memories of Celtic's victory in the European Cup in 1967, I thought of the boundless ambition of Jock Stein, who transformed a team of footballers, most born within 30 miles of Glasgow, into champions. He made the best of what he had; rather sadly, he later bowed to realism when, as Scottish manager, he warned us to lower our expectations. Yet expectations which run in conflict with reality are at the heart of our disenchantment with politics. And behind disillusion with New Labour is the perception that where it has failed it has done so out of timidity. As attacks on asylum-seekers multiply on the streets of the so-called Merchant City, it strives to be to the right of Hague. As our hospitals decay, it babbles about private finance and has allowed the rate of public investment to go on sinking as a proportion of GDP, though Gordon Brown now promises to reverse that trend. It has been wretchedly timid and often I wonder what the difference is between it and the Tories. Many friends have decided to vote elsewhere or not vote at all. Tommy Sheridan's party is picking up a following among the chattering classes and he is to be congratulated on his party's stance against working-class racism. Yet I shall vote Labour for two reasons, even though I'm not enamoured of the incumbent in my constituency. The first is Europe. The prospect of Hague and his Little Englanders unleashed is indeed depressing. The only consolation, perhaps, is that the sight of Hague strutting his stuff in Brussels, to the applause of the Mail and the Telegraph, might finally sicken Tories like Ken Clarke and Chris Patten, driving them at last into the arms of Labour or the Liberal Democrats. Of course, no party is sounder on Europe than the Lib Dems, though even Charles Kennedy, faced on TV by a pack of rent-a-crowd Tories in the audience, last week sounded a little equivocal on the euro. The second reason is the major achievement of this administration - its constitutional reforms. These need a second term to bed down and develop. The question of Scotland's share of public spending has become increasingly volatile, even if much of the commentary in the south, in newspapers which should know better, has been ill-informed. When I met Martin O'Neill last week, he conceded that some of his Westminster colleagues had struggled to find a meaningful role. Their numbers are going to be reduced but their strategic importance remains as long as parliamentary sovereignty is entirely invested in Westminster. Which brings me back to the question of ambition. Does Scotland want to make the best of things or would it prefer to languish in a perpetual resentment? The politics of grievance were the companions of my youth, just as much as Hopalong or the Famous Five. Colin Bell, Tommy's new acolyte, sneers that his old party, the SNP, is now just a collection of suits. That is no bad thing. John Swinney's rational approach is just what is required as our new parliament beds in. Come the Scottish elections in 2003, he may do very well. In the meantime, our task is, like the late Jock Stein's, to make the best of what we have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
