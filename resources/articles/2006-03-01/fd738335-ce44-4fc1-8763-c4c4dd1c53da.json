But surely tonight is the night for City fans to throw off the constraints and get behind their team. For all the many positive vibes coming out of the club this year, Stuart Pearce's team have seen Wigan, Blackburn and Bolton head them in the Premiership and, should they lose to West Ham this evening, they might face an acutely dispiriting end-of-season run which could have a significant knock-on effect. Not that Pearce would ever allow his players to feel sorry for themselves for long. In this respect he and Paul Jewell are temperamentally similar. Wigan have rightly won praise, none greater than for picking themselves up after the drubbing they took against Manchester United in the Carling Cup final. \"We were a wounded animal after that match and we have bounced back,\" said Jewell. It has not been pretty. Wigan are not playing anything like they were before Christmas, and on Saturday were only marginally better than a mend-and-make-do City team, most of whom were only too aware that their chances of playing tonight were remote, and became ever more so as the match progressed. For Wigan the pace of Jason Roberts and Henri Camara remains a constant danger and it was doubtless this implicit threat that resulted in a comical double kicking error by David James that led directly to the second-half corner from which Lee McCulloch headed the winning goal. Though Wigan struggled to find cohesion there was never a hint of anything less than total commitment. \"My players know I won't accept anything less,\" said Jewell. This season's astounding success - \"Our name has spread as far as Wigan Borough now,\" joked Jewell - may make it a little easier to attract better players, although he is aware that next season, with any element of surprise having gone, will be tougher. \"It is a tremendous achievement for us to be safe at this stage and our job now is to make sure the players stay on their toes.\" For that reason Jewell refused to talk about the possibility of European qualification. Europe has impinged on the thoughts of City throughout the campaign, having come within a kick of it last season. This defeat all but closed off one route, so the FA Cup is virtually everything now. Pearce remained insistent he had selected a team he thought could win against Wigan; the players, apparently, did not share this belief, while a further injury to Georgios Samaras, who came on to replace Antoine Sibierski, may prove critical. Whatever the attacking spearhead against West Ham, Pearce will expect a return to the collective form that saw off Aston Villa. \"We're at our best when we set the tempo from the start and win the second balls,\" said Pearce - in other words, Wigan Athletic encapsulated.
