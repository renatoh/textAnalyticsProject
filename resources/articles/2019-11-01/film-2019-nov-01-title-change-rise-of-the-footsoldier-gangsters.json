There\u2019s the series\u2019 Rotten Tomatoes score, which has oscillated from a high of 88% to a horrible low of 23%. There\u2019s the sad realisation that Shaun Ryder won\u2019t be in any of the new films, after he was so memorably stabbed to death with a lightbulb in the last one. And now they have a name change to contend with. Next week\u2019s fourth instalment had originally been titled Rise of the Footsoldier: Marbella. But now, in a last-minute reverse ferret, it is to be called Rise of the Footsoldier: The Spanish Heist. Why? Perhaps producers were worried the original title was too geographically specific, or that it didn\u2019t explicitly promise dumb violence. Maybe this new one is just easier to pronounce. But one thing is for certain. A name change of any kind is more often than not a bad thing. Look at what happened to Ford v Ferrari. That was a great title for a film. Two great car brands \u2013 one a workaday populist, the other an expensive status symbol \u2013 facing off against each other. You saw the title Ford v Ferrari and you knew exactly what the film was about. Except it isn\u2019t called Ford vs Ferrari in the UK. Here it\u2019s been changed to Le Mans 66, which is just about the worst title ever given to a film. It\u2019s simultaneously more specific and more obscure, plus it ends with a number. You\u2019ll remember that the play The Madness of George III was retitled as The Madness of King George when it was adapted for the screen, so as not to alienate people who might think it was the completion of a trilogy. The same could be said here. Why am I going to watch Le Mans 66 if I haven\u2019t seen all first 65? Worse, will I have to do a French accent when I ask for a ticket? Because I don\u2019t shop at Hotel Chocolat for exactly that reason. This sort of thing infuriates me. When a film\u2019s title is changed for the UK market, it dilutes its creative impact. The screenwriter wrote the film with a title in mind. It was produced and marketed everywhere else in the world with that title, but then it hits these shores with a new name and a slightly shoddier title sequence. Back in 1987, Harry and the Hendersons was Harry and the Hendersons until it came here, at which point it became Bigfoot and the Hendersons because apparently we\u2019d have struggled to tell that it was a film about a Bigfoot, despite the poster having a giant bloody Bigfoot on it. Yes, I\u2019m still sore. There are other examples. When it was theatrically released here, Bonnie and Clyde was given the unnecessarily explanatory title Bonnie and Clyde \u2026 Were Killers! Battle: Los Angeles became World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles, because presumably British viewers wouldn\u2019t care all that much if only Los Angeles was wiped off the map by an army of bloodthirsty aliens. I\u2019m still furious about having to ask for a ticket to see Avengers Assemble, in case someone at the cinema got confused and accidentally ushered me into a screening of The Avengers, the 1998 Ralph Fiennes adaptation of a TV show about a man with a deadly umbrella. In fairness, it does work the other way. Ice Cold in Alex was marketed in the US as Desert Attack, which robs the film of all its charm. And Jason Statham\u2019s 2013 film Hummingbird was retitled Redemption in the US, after a marketing executive realised that Americans only like films that sound like they\u2019ve been coped from aspirational vinyl wall decals. But not every film that\u2019s had its name messed about with is bad. Take Tom Cruise\u2019s Edge of Tomorrow. It originally had the much better title All You Need Is Kill, after the book it was adapted from, before wimping out with an incredibly vague new name. It was so bad, in fact, that the name was changed again \u2013 to Live Die Repeat \u2013 for the DVD release. And it\u2019s a great film, even though nobody really knows what it\u2019s actually called any more. So Rise of the Footsoldier: The Spanish Heist needn\u2019t worry. Just because it has a new name, it doesn\u2019t mean that this new instalment won\u2019t contain the same highly nuanced character work of the previous three Rise of the Footsoldier films."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
