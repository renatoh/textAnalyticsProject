The Rhinos proved that the bruising disappointment of losing the World Club Challenge title to Manly is out of their system by producing easily their slickest performance since last year's grand final victory over the Saints, with the tiny scrum-half Rob Burrow making a welcome return to his scampering best. Leeds had won their first four games of the season through defensive resilience rather than attacking brilliance, but stunned Wigan last night with a four-try blitz to take a 22-0 lead after half an hour. Burrow, the England scrum-half whose effectiveness has been limited by a back injury and concussion, set them on their way with a 40-20 kick to lay on the opening try for Kylie Leuluai. Burrow's half-back partner Danny McGuire was in equally effervescent mood and it was his kick that set up the second Rhinos try for Scott Donald, after a mistake by the young Wigan wing Shaun Ainscough. Leeds's third try was questionable as the second-row Ian Kirke seemed to have thrown the ball forward after surging through some weak Wigan defence, but the referee Ian Smith waved play on for Burrow to score under the posts. Then the substitute Ali Lauitiiti produced one of his trademark one-handed passes to send Ryan Hall over in the left corner. Wigan were blown away, although they did pull a try back in the first half through Ainscough. They could have been right back in the contest had the video referee Phil Bentham been in a charitable mood. Instead he denied tries to Thomas Leuluai, and then Gareth Hock, for whom an unhappy night continued as his explosive charge through the Leeds defence was negated by Bentham's decision that a team-mate had obstructed the Rhinos second-row Carl Ablett. The mood of Wigan's fans was not improved when Leeds appeared to get away with an obstruction in the build-up to a second try for Hall, although he did well to collect Burrow's perfect kick. Then Bentham awarded Leeds's sixth try to Jamie Peacock on the benefit of the doubt. Hock claimed a late consolation but this was not Wigan's night, and a reality check after the euphoria of their thrashing of Bradford last Saturday. Leeds will expect a far stiffer challenge from St Helens, who warmed up for the season's first real heavyweight showdown with a crushing 38-12 win over visitors Salford.
