They said they were investigating what happened during one of the stops made by the vehicle. Asked whether Gray was fatally hurt by a so-called \u201crough ride\u201d without a seatbelt in the back of the vehicle, or could have been injured outside the van, police commissioner Anthony Batts said at a press conference there were \u201cpotentials for both of those\u201d. \u201cIf someone harmed Freddie Gray, we will have to prosecute him,\u201d said Batts. Deputy commissioner Kevin Davis said officials were looking into the second of three stops the van\u2019s driver made after Gray was arrested on the morning of 12 April. \u201cThe facts of that interaction are under investigation,\u201d said Davis. Gray, 25, died last Sunday after suffering a broken neck and injured voice box. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said earlier this week \u201cwhat happened happened inside the van,\u201d echoing a police report that said Gray \u201csuffered a medical emergency\u201d in the vehicle. City authorities are running a criminal inquiry into his death and the US Department of Justice is investigating for potential civil rights charges. The six officers involved in Gray\u2019s arrest have been suspended. Batts confirmed to the Guardian on Friday that one of the officers was declining to speak with investigators, citing their constitutional rights. Video of Gray\u2019s arrest, which showed him being dragged into the police van by officers, has been cited by protesters as reason to doubt police claims that Gray was healthy when first placed in the van. While he was shouting in apparent pain and moving his head, one of his legs appeared limp. The video did not show his initial treatment by police. In a cryptic section of his remarks on Friday, Batts suggested investigators were concentrating on a specific event that occurred between Gray\u2019s arrest and his collection by an ambulance at the western district police headquarters about 40 minutes later. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is, and I\u2019m not going to give you all the information, there\u2019s an incident, or not \u2018incident\u2019, because I\u2019ll get you off on the right path. There\u2019s something that we have to look at, that we have to have further investigation on.\u201d Batts confirmed that Gray, who was in leg irons, was not wearing a seatbelt in the vehicle as required by the department\u2019s policy. \u201cThere are no excuses for that. Period,\u201d he said. Past prisoners in Baltimore have died from injuries sustained when they were thrown around the back of police vehicles due to fast or erratic driving and abrupt stops. The police commissioner reiterated that his officers \u201cfailed to get medical attention\u201d for Gray despite his requests for an asthma inhaler and other complaints. Batts said medics should have been called to the scene of Gray\u2019s arrest. Davis said Gray said he needed a medic during a third stop by the van, made to pick up a second prisoner, but an ambulance was not called until 25 minutes later, after the vehicle arrived at police headquarters. Batts told reporters that during the third stop, officers \u201cpicked him up off the floor and placed him on a seat\u201d. Batts said on Thursday that the second prisoner, who was separated from Gray by a metal wall, told investigators that Gray was \u201cwas still moving around, that he was kicking and making noises\u201d until the van arrived at the station. Police are declining to identify the man due to his status as a witness in the criminal inquiry. Protesters gathered in west Baltimore for a sixth evening of demonstrations on Friday and hundreds of people and protest organisations are expected to descend on the city on Saturday. Police urged demonstrators to remain calm and non-violent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
