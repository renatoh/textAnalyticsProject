Raphael Sanchez, formerly the lead attorney for the Seattle Ice office, also used the photograph of a murdered woman on some of the fake identities he created and claimed several deported immigrants as dependents to dodge tax collectors. Sanchez, who for six years directed Ice legal actions for Alaska and the Pacific north-west, said self-hatred, loneliness and depression drove him to commit fraud. \u201cI pretended I needed no one and thought material things would bring me happiness, even if temporarily,\u201d Sanchez, 44, said in a letter to the court. \u201cI created an intricate, beautiful, yet soulless house of cards that suddenly came crashing down.\u201d Sanchez pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in February as part of the plea deal that saw him sentenced on Thursday by the US district judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle. \u201cSanchez carried the heavy responsibility of speaking for the American government itself, giving voice to the principles of our immigration system and advocating for its fair administration,\u201d said the prosecutor Jessica Harvey in court papers. \u201cSanchez abandoned the principles he swore to uphold and used his authority merely as a vehicle for personal profit.\u201d For at least four years, Sanchez culled information from case files on immigrants facing deportation proceedings. He created counterfeit social security cards and driver\u2019s licenses using his victims\u2019 names and birthdates. To dupe the credit bureaus, he concocted bogus utility accounts and income statements. He then used those stolen identities to open credit cards and bank accounts \u2013 and run up debts. Sanchez, who used his personal address on many of the applications, then argued with the credit bureaus when the accounts were flagged as fraudulent. Many of Sanchez\u2019s victims are likely to have no idea their identities were abused, and prosecutors said that their immigration statuses made it less likely that they would discover and report the fraud. \u201cSanchez targeted individuals who had been deported or were otherwise excludable from the United States, leaving them unlikely to discover that he had stolen their identities and unequipped to report it,\u201d Harvey noted in court papers. Harvey and Luke Cass, trial attorneys with the justice department\u2019s public integrity section, prosecuted Sanchez. Sanchez also lied to the Internal Revenue Service, claiming three immigrants he was impersonating as dependents on his federal tax return. Facing judgment, Sanchez presented himself as a man undone by psychological scars from wounds he received as a child. Born in Puerto Rico and raised in New Jersey, Sanchez purports to have survived an abusive upbringing. Writing the court, the defense attorney Cassandra Stamm said Sanchez was left with a tendency toward self-sabotage. Sanchez joined Ice in 2001 and was promoted to chief counsel at the Seattle office in 2011. He managed Ice attorneys in immigration courts in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington state. In a letter to the court, Sanchez described himself as increasingly isolated and depressed before he began stealing identities. \u201cIt became a perfect storm that did not allow me to see the hurtfulness and wrongfulness of my actions,\u201d Sanchez said. Sanchez was earning $162,000 a year at the time of his arrest. \u201cSanchez sold his principles for profit,\u201d Harvey said. Sanchez, who has been detained since February, was also sentenced to four years of court supervision after his release. He has surrendered his law license."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
