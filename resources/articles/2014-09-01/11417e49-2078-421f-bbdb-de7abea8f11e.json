The Czech striker made no mistake from the spot to score the game\u2019s only goal and give the Hornets their first win at Bloomfield Road since 2009, after Tony McMahon had brought down Lloyd Dyer. Watford dominated the first half and apart from McMahon\u2019s third-minute effort from 25 yards, which Heurelho Gomes had to tip round the post, Blackpool rarely threatened in the first half-hour. The best chance of the half came in the 42nd minute as Watford countered a Blackpool corner but Joe Lewis denied Ikechi Anya with a fantastic save. Troy Deeney should have put Watford ahead in the 57th minute after bursting through a packed Blackpool box but he shot straight at Lewis. The breakthrough finally came in the 66th minute as Dyer, who had replaced Lewis McGugan eight minutes earlier, turned McMahon in the box, with the Blackpool captain bringing him down to allow Vydra to convert low to Lewis\u2019s right. The home side were galvanised and Watford were lucky to hold on to their lead when Daniel Pudil was adjudged to have brought down the substitute Nile Ranger but the former Newcastle United man\u2019s penalty struck the inside of the post before rebounding clear. Ishmael Miller had a chance to equalise late on from John Lundstram\u2019s free-kick but his header was saved well by Gomes, who saw Watford to a deserved win. Danny Batth\u2019s 65th-minute equaliser secured Wolves a 1-1 draw at promotion rivals Charlton. The hosts had led through Andre Bikey-Amougou\u2019s volley but Kenny Jackett\u2019s side were well worth their point after a spirited second-half display was rewarded by Batth\u2019s headed leveller. Lee Evans was not far away for Wolves with a low 25-yard drive midway through the first half but it was Charlton who broke the deadlock after 25 minutes when Bikey-Amougou volleyed past Carl Ikeme from Jordan Cousins\u2019 corner. It was almost 2-0 straight away as George Tucudean dragged his shot agonisingly wide after being put through by Igor Vetokele. Charlton had the woodwork to thank after George Saville was denied by the post and Evans again went close with an effort from outside the area but it was the London side who went in at the break with their noses in front. In the second half Stephen Henderson came to Charlton\u2019s rescue by tipping behind Bakary Sako\u2019s angled drive but it was to be only a temporary reprieve as Batth rose high to head home from the resulting James Henry corner. Wolves had their tails up and Kevin McDonald\u2019s volley from the edge of the penalty area sailed just over the bar. Rhoys Wiggins made a vital challenge to deny Leon Clarke a shot at goal but the ball was then given away by Bikey-Amougou and Henry smashed an effort against the post. Johnnie Jackson failed to hit the target after being put clear in the box by Vetokele\u2019s flick on and Ikeme came out to gather at the feet of Franck Moussa as the clock ticked down. Vetokele latched on to Jackson\u2019s stoppage-time pass but again Ikeme held his nerve to deny the Addicks and ensure his side went home with a share of the spoils. Reading secured their third successive league victory with a hard-earned 3-2 win over a dogged Millwall side at the Madejski Stadium. Reading took the lead in the sixth minute. Adam Federici launched a huge clearance downfield and Simon Cox unleashed a 20-yard drive past the Millwall goalkeeper, David Forde, for his third goal of the season since rejoining the Berkshire club from Nottingham Forest. Millwall were 2-0 down in the 15th minute. Nick Blackman drove in from the left and was brought down by Byron Webster. Blackman took the penalty himself and comfortably dispatched it past Forde for his second goal in successive games. Millwall reduced the deficit in the 39th minute. Ricardo Fuller shimmied into the Reading penalty area and fired a low shot past Federici\u2019s despairing dive. Millwall\u2019s manager, Ian Holloway, had to be spoken to by the referee Keith Hill as his frustrations boiled over on the touchline \u2013 but he was let off with a warning. Millwall were level in the 54th minute after a period of sustained pressure had tested the home defence. The substitute Martyn Woolford slung over a corner from the right, Federici missed it and the defender Mark Beevers headed home easily at the far post. There was nothing to choose between the sides thereafter until Reading made the decisive breakthrough when Jordan Obita\u2019s corner was nodded in from close range by Cox. Leeds United\u2019s caretaker manager, Neil Redfearn, boosted his hopes of getting the job on a permanent basis with a 3-1 win at Bournemouth, where Andrew Surman put the Cherries in front early on but United hit back through Souleymane Doukara, Giuseppe Bellusci and Mirco Antenucci. Stevie May and Jeremy Helan hit the target as Sheffield Wednesday won 2-0 at Birmingham. Ipswich beat Brighton by the same scoreline at Portman Road thanks to goals from Jonathan Parr and Daryl Murphy. Enrique Garcia Martinez put Middlesbrough ahead at Cardiff after two minutes and that was how it stayed, while Huddersfield and Wigan drew 0-0. Struggling Bolton enjoyed a welcome boost when edging out Rotherham 3-2 thanks to a Joe Mason hat-trick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
