The swing in votes reflected a shift away from Trump in suburbs across America that would appear to complicate his re-election in 2020 if he\u2019s unable to bolster support elsewhere, particularly in rural areas of swing states. The impeachment hearings unfolding in Washington, which will enter their public phase on Wednesday, look unlikely to help. The Republican leadership\u2019s efforts to whip up outrage against the process as illegitimate, including a stunt where members of Congress stormed a room where witness depositions were being taken to claim Democrats were trying the president in secret, has again riled a hard core of Trump supporters to rally angrily in his defense. But there is also a part of the electorate that voted for him \u2013 less ideological Republican supporters and independents \u2013 who are prepared to see where the evidence leads. They have a more open mind than Trump campaign strategists would like. A Fox News poll showed nearly half of Americans favor impeaching the president and one-third of those opposed could change their minds if presented with new evidence. \u201cI vote Republican or I don\u2019t vote,\u201d said Bill Harris, a business manager who supports Trump. \u201cThis is all political. Nancy Pelosi is out to get Trump. Anyone can see that. That\u2019s Washington. But I do think he has questions to answer. We need to hear the evidence, hear the people who were there. I\u2019m not against that.\u201d Harris said he knows of others who voted for Trump whose doubts about the president have been stacking up and that if there is evidence of wrongdoing it would turn them away from him. \u201cThere are those who defend him no matter what and then there are those people who think he\u2019s too unpredictable, too unstable. He\u2019s done some good things on trade but I think there are a lot of Republicans like myself who have doubts and concerns. I wish he would keep his mouth shut,\u201d he said. Then he added an afterthought. \u201cIt would be a mistake for the Democrats to remove him. They should let the election do that. If the Democrats have the evidence, the voters will make the decision,\u201d he said. That is precisely what some Johnson county Democrats are counting on. The county won\u2019t make much difference to the overall outcome of the presidential election as Kansas is a solidly Republican state. But it will be crucial in Davids\u2019 fight for re-election and maintaining Democratic control of Congress, and it is reflective of the shift in other big city suburbs across the midwest, which will have an important say in who wins in 2020. Nancy Leiker, the chair of the Johnson county Democratic party, said impeachment is not the most important issue for most voters. That remains healthcare. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help but think that as the investigation goes on and becomes more public, those numbers will change,\u201d she said. Leiker said opposition to Trump has drawn more people into campaigning and Democrats think the impeachment hearings can only help. Cassie Woolworth, a contract IT analyst and single mother of three boys, was among those who largely ignored politics until Trump was elected. \u201cMy generation of women took their eye off the ball. We thought the battles were won,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he got elected, I was so angry. I felt so defeated.\u201d So Woolworth joined a local women\u2019s branch of the Democratic Party and banged on doors to get Davids elected in 2018. She was also out campaigning in local elections last week. \u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the independents here stepping back from the Republican party. I think it\u2019s because Trump keeps speaking,\u201d she said. Woolworth thinks the impeachment process will evolve into a political test for Republican members of Congress from midwestern states. \u201cOnce people have heard the evidence, they will be judged by voters over how they voted on impeachment,\u201d she said. Some people will not take very much convincing. Kent Tyler, an artist who voted for George W Bush and then Barack Obama, regards Trump with disdain but is waiting to see what the impeachment hearings reveal. \u201cBefore I make up my mind, I want to see what will come to light. I think it\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cI call myself a conservative Democrat. I used to be in the middle. Undeclared. Once Trump got into office, and he started doing his stuff, I switched to Democrat. Things need to be brought to light. I think the evidence is going to be very damaging.\u201d Still Tyler worries about what the impact of the hearings on an already divided country. \u201cSo much hate has been made in America, I think it\u2019s going to get very nasty,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
