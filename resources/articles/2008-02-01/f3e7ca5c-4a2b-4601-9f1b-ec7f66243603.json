As John Vidal reports, the carbon dioxide emissions from shipping are calculated to make up almost 4.5% of today's global total, a share likely to rise to nearly 6% by 2020. These are already noteworthy figures, but the sector's contribution to global warming appears even greater if you take into account that it has been around since the 19th century: given the long lifetime of CO2, we are still \"feeling\" the effect of those emissions today. It is important to be aware, however, that the science surrounding shipping emissions is complicated, and is quite a \"young\" area in terms of research - which may be one of the reasons it has managed for so long to avoid the spotlight. A key complexity is that the global warming effect (or \"radiative forcing\") of shipping emissions is currently tempered by the so-called ship tracks they produce: persistent low-level clouds initiated by the exhaust emissions of ships. These are clearly visible from satellites, and have a cooling effect (unlike aircraft contrails) which may, at present, mask the warming impact of the CO2 emissions. But this does not mean ships are benign - far from it. First, it is simplistic to suppose that the warming and cooling impacts of the two different effects nicely cancel each other out. And second, as pressure mounts to control the sulphur content of shipping fuel, because of its effects on local air quality around ports, as well as longer-range problems like acid rain, the cooling effect will be lost - leaving us with a particularly long-lasting warming effect from CO2. Measures to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels are something I called for in a report for the European Parliament back in 2003, and from 2010 it will be obligatory for ships in EU waters to use low-sulphur fuel. Furthermore, the International Maritime Organisation last week finalised proposals for reducing air pollution from ships (tighter NOx standards for new ship engines, plus measures to reduce emissions of sulphur oxide and particulate matter), which will go to the Organisation's Marine Environment Protection Committee for approval this October. So, what can we do to address shipping emissions? In many ways, the sector occupies a similarly cushy legislative niche to aviation, in the sense of being excluded from the Kyoto commitments, outside the UK Climate Change bill, exempt from much of the taxation that applies to other transport sectors - including of its bunker fuel - and not currently covered by the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Like aviation, responsibility for the emissions of which had been entrusted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation - with absolutely no action resulting - shipping's contribution to global warming had been deemed to be best dealt with by the International Maritime Organisation. In the 10 years since this decision was made, however, no concrete measures have been forthcoming, and it is therefore now high time for the EU to take urgent steps of its own - again, something I called for in my 2003 report. In light of this long wait, it is hardly encouraging that in the area of climate legislation where activity is most lively, namely emissions trading - even if other measures would in fact be more suitable - the proposals from the European Commission for the period from 2013 still fail to bring in shipping. Fortunately, environmental legislation is an area where the European Parliament has co-legislative powers, and I intend to do all I can to ensure we use them effectively. Clearly, discussions on the ETS will provide the first potential opportunity for action, but we must be aware that bringing shipping into the scheme is far from being the only way to ensure tighter regulation of its emissions, and - as with aviation - we must ensure it is done very carefully. Apart from anything else, seeing the nominally impressive figures cited by Intertanko on the increased efficiency of today's tankers - but then noting the nevertheless alarming projected increase in overall emissions from shipping over the coming years - shows that technological improvements alone will be no help at all unless we also look at the volume of ship movements, and increasing demand for freight transport. From a technical point of view, this means it is crucial that there be limits on the number of emission rights the shipping sector is permitted to buy from other industries - to prevent it simply carrying on with business as usual, on the back of progress made in other sectors. And, more generally, it does also ultimately mean looking at the amount and the manner in which we consume. Is it really the best use of fuel and emissions to ferry 13,000 containers of toys, food, clothes and televisions from China to Europe each month on the Emma Maersk and others like her, for example? These are issues to be explored in a hearing I will host for MEPs next month, and I look forward to seeing the same level of debate develop over shipping as we have at long last reached on aviation - hopefully, to be followed up rapidly with rather more effective action than has been generated there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
