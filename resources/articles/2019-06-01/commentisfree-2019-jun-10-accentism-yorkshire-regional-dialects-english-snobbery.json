If you have endured a whole episode then you\u2019ll know that the Yorkshire dialect is a key element of the show\u2019s humour. I watch David Jason\u2019s Doncaster-based japes with a stony face. Perhaps the charm of the series is lost on me because I\u2019m bored out of my chuffing mind by seeing Yorkshire\u2019s working-class communities parodied for comic effect. We\u2019re used to these trite \u201cwi\u2019 nowt teken owt\u201d portrayals of regional dialect. Still Open All Hours, like Last of the Summer Wine, stands in a long tradition of hackneyed portrayals of bolshy but benign Yorkshire-sounding characters offering gentle, down-to-earth \u201cby \u2018eck, lad\u2019 humour\u201d with their hilarious flat vowels. This week, I\u2019ll present an episode of Radio 4\u2019s Tongue and Talk series, focusing on Yorkshire dialect. During the interviews for the programme, I heard many people lament the death of the sounds and words that comprise it. I was told time and again that it is disappearing: \u201ctrue\u201d Yorkshire English is scarce, fragile and imperilled. For many it seems to symbolise a time when communities were close-knit and common identity was bolstered by a shared use of language. I was told that these days barely anyone uses authentic Yorkshire dialect, save for a few enthusiasts and older people. And yet I hear it, and use it, all the time. Yorkshire English isn\u2019t an archaic form of speech, lost along with the region\u2019s heavy industry and economic prosperity. It\u2019s vibrant and evolving \u2013 but it\u2019s also disparaged and denigrated by those who find it uncouth, a signifier of backwardness or poor education. I was born in Mexborough, Doncaster \u2013 just a stone\u2019s throw from where Still Open All Hours is set, in fact \u2013 and I went to a comprehensive school in Rotherham. I\u2019m now an academic at the University of Sheffield, although I regularly receive horrified emails from those who\u2019ve heard me speak wondering why on earth I was given a job in a university when I sound, and I quote, \u201clike you\u2019ve never even attended school\u201d. These attitudes used to upset me, but nowadays I couldn\u2019t give a toss; my accent and use of dialect words gives me a strong sense of connection to the people and places I love. My Nannan and Auntie Annie spoke like me and they were bloody brill; if it was good enough for them then it\u2019s good enough for me \u2013 and it should certainly be good enough for anyone else. I might not care much about the opinions of those who insult me and the way I speak, but I do care about how these prejudices affect others, especially children. Like the people I interviewed, I often had my dialect \u201ccorrected\u201d at school by teachers. \u201cGee o\u2019er nah\u201d we\u2019d say to the lads who\u2019d twang our bra straps in class. Rather than telling those lads off, our teacher would be more concerned about our use of dialect. \u201cGee o\u2019er nah,\u201d sir would say, in a parody of our speech, \u201cis not proper English.\u201d You might like to think that the days of belittling regional dialect are long gone, but those of us who use it know that\u2019s far from the truth. My 12-year-old niece, Ella, attends a local high school much like mine and she\u2019s regularly told off for using dialect. Recently, after she was overhead telling her sister \u201cYer reyt annoying, you\u201d, she was warned by a teacher that she wouldn\u2019t get a good job if she didn\u2019t \u201cspeak correctly\u201d. Of course, to \u201cspeak correctly\u201d here means to use standard English. Is the teacher wrong? Unfortunately there\u2019s evidence to suggest not. Alex Baratta, a linguist at the University of Manchester, researches accentism and has found that some employers in sectors such as law and the media do discriminate against speakers of regional dialects. Viewing these as \u201cslang\u201d compared to standard English is plain wrong. All dialects and accents are linguistically valid. Standard English, which is basically the dialect of middle- and upper-class southerners, is only considered to be the \u201ccorrect\u201d form because it carries the highest social prestige. Should we tolerate what amounts to linguistic profiling in recruitment? Nay, gerraway wi\u2019 thi. There\u2019s no way to justify this biased behaviour. My interviewees are all very proud of their Yorkshire roots and quite rightly so. Each of them felt that it was essential that children carry on the linguistic legacy and be taught to recognise and celebrate their heritage. Which is not to say that dialect is merely an emblem of history and fixed identity. It\u2019s also something that\u2019s diverse and dynamic. I did speak to a few older blokes in flat caps who wouldn\u2019t look out of place on the set of Last of the Summer Wine, but I also met Sharena Lee Satti, a poet of Indian and Pakistani heritage who reads her work in Bradford dialect. And there\u2019s Toria Garbutt, a punk poet from Knottingley, who uses dialect in her work not only to celebrate her regional identity but also to rail against classism and sexism. In her poem Dares Not to Dream, Garbutt tells us that \u201cshit sticks in corners of forgotten towns\u201d where \u201cold women, weathered as wellies, sit by thi sens, sup pints at eleven. No coffee mornings for these old lasses, no OAP yoga classes \u2013 they\u2019ve come \u2018ere to forget, they\u2019ve come to put their minds at rest \u2026 And they\u2019re strong as Yorkshire tea.\u201d Garbutt knows in her bones what I\u2019ve learned by talking to people across Yorkshire: our dialect is alive, kicking and bloody gorgeous. \u2022 Katie Edwards is a lecturer in the School of English at Sheffield University"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
