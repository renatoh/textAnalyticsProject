But we do know that it was alone. Mr Obama conducted the most closely watched meeting of his four-month-old administration without senior officials present. And when that includes people like his defence secretary, Robert Gates, and the national security adviser, James Jones, one can conclude that Mr Obama was determined to come to his own view about what could, and could not, be achieved with the new Israeli prime minister. To judge from his performance in the press conference afterwards, Mr Obama was not to be deflected from his purpose. If he could not get Mr Netanyahu to say out loud that the peace process would result in a Palestinian state, the US leader stated unambiguously that Israel had to stop settlement construction. He also said that while Gazans had no hope, no access to clean water, and could not rebuild their homes because the border closures are so tight, no progress would be made on the bigger issues. This needed saying by a US president. There is, however, a world of difference between putting these issues back on the table and getting Mr Netanyahu to deliver on them. The two-state issue may not be as immediately contentious as getting Israel to start honouring existing commitments on dismantling outposts, freezing settlement construction, removing roadblocks, stopping house demolitions. These could form the central battleground between Israel and the US administration over the next months. Nor are there any signs yet that Mr Netanyahu has succeeded in diverting attention from the Israel-Palestine conflict by saying that his country faces an existential threat from Iran's alleged bomb-making plans. Quite the opposite. If the Israeli leader now argues that the Palestinian leadership is too weak to give Israel the security commitments it needs to disengage from the West Bank, that leaves the Arab states as Israel's only partner. But if they are going to make the Arab Peace Initiative an operational plan, the Saudis, Egypt and Jordan will need movement on the ground, on the very issues Israel has been so reluctant to change. The same applies to Mr Netanyahu's attempt to assemble a Sunni Arab coalition against Shia Iran. It boomerangs back on the Israeli leader. In reality the so-called \"bottom up\" issues like dismantling outposts will have to be addressed simultaneously with the final status issues like Palestinian statehood. Mr Obama has started well by showing a personal commitment early in his presidency. He now has to stay engaged. Mr Netanyahu may well come to regret such close personal attention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
