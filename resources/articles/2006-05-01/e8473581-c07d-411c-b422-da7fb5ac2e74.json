Paul Robinson has read their report for the MediaGuardian podcast and tells Emily Bell and me what he thinks of it. We also discuss podcast advertising, the gathering coalition against the BBC - and Emily finds time to rail against the new-look Newsnight. Sir Christopher Meyer, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, defends his tenure in charge of the press watchdog, and Gareth McLean brings us the benefit of his wisdom on everything from Big Brother to the Guardian's D&amp;AD award. This week, we launch our podpost hotline: if you've got Skype, you can call us with your questions or comments at GU_studio and leave us a recorded message. We'll play the best ones. You can also record comments on an audio file and email them to us - the address is media@theguardian.com. And before you ask, yes, the podcast was recorded before Stephen Carter announced he was stepping down as chief executive of Ofcom - we might discuss that next week. Happy listening. www.theguardian.com/podcasts Matt Wells, media editor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
