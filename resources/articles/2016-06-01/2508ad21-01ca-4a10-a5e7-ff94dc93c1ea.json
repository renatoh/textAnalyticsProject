Aaron Ramsey, Neil Taylor and Gareth Bale scored the goals on a memorable night for Welsh football as Russia were beaten 3-0, sparking huge celebrations among Coleman, his players and their supporters. The Wales manager praised his team for the character they showed in responding to the defeat by England in Lens and hailed the fans for their contribution on an evening when their singing could be heard long after the final whistle. \u201cWhen you see a sea of red supporters and hear that kind of support \u2013 as a nation geographically we\u2019re small but I think if you\u2019re judging us on passion then we could be described as a continent tonight because that was amazing,\u201d Coleman said. Asked what the win and progress to the knockout stage meant to him personally, Coleman replied: \u201cThis is the best because whether you\u2019re a player or a manager or a coach, it\u2019s all about the points. I think the performance tonight was really pleasing. I\u2019ve been a player myself and just missed out on a major tournament and been part of a few really good teams, so I\u2019m so lucky now to be experiencing this as a manager. And to see your team perform like that, execute everything that you\u2019ve worked on, that\u2019s really pleasing. So I\u2019m immensely proud.\u201d Bale is the tournament\u2019s leading scorer with three goals, although this was not an occasion for the \u201cone-man team\u201d tag. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a player like Gareth Bale who plays for Real Madrid and scores the goal he does, I don\u2019t mind people saying that \u2013 I can understand that,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAt times he has won games doing something extraordinary but anyone who\u2019s played football knows you need team spirit.\u201d One of the biggest challenges for Coleman could be to control expectations before their last-16 match at Parc des Princes against one of the third-placed teams, yet he insisted that would not be a problem. \u201cThree games ago we lost 3-0 against Sweden. Football can change really quickly \u2013 you really are king for a day. Once you get caught up with things and think you\u2019ve arrived \u2026 you\u2019ve never arrived in football. \u201cWhoever\u2019s next is going to be a massive challenge for us. Not to say we can\u2019t enjoy tonight. But we\u2019re not a country that\u2019s been at tournament after tournament, semi-finals, finals. This is new to us. It\u2019s exciting, nerve-racking at times, a lot of pressure and tension. And our boys know that unless we\u2019re maxing out we don\u2019t get results. If we\u2019re maxing out and at our best, then we\u2019ve always got a chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
