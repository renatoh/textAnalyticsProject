The cocoa used to make the chocolate was most likely grown in West Africa \u2013 around 70% of the world\u2019s supply is. Once grown, the beans might be sold to a large processor, to be made into butter, powder or liqueur. Though they\u2019re not household names, 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa products are processed by three companies: Barry Callebaut, Cargill and Olam. From there, the processed cocoa will be sold again \u2013 probably to one of five major conglomerates: Mondelez, Mars, Ferrero, Hershey\u2019s or Nestle, who alongside bean-to-bar manufacturer Lindt, produce 80% of the world\u2019s chocolate. At the very start of this chain, the potential for damaging practices is huge. Since 2001, the use of harmful child labour \u2013 a form of modern slavery \u2013 on cocoa farms has been an issue known to manufacturers, politicians and the general public. Since 1960, 90% of Ivory Coast\u2019s rainforests, including National Parks, have been lost to deforestation. The CSIRO estimate the average Australian consumes 32kg of chocolate a year, and in the absence of tight legislation, it\u2019s up to consumers to make informed choices. But the complex supply chains that hide these dirty secrets make it difficult. This year, three NGOs \u2013 Mighty Earth, Be Slavery Free and Green America \u2013 have banded together to produce an Easter chocolate guide that helps consumers sort good and bad eggs. The desk review looks at the policies and promises of major chocolate manufacturers and processors, and assigns them scores based on six factors relating to their environmental and labour practices. In Australia and New Zealand, iconic New Zealand chocolate brand Whittaker\u2019s came out on top, winning a Good Egg Award for their \u201cleadership in policies and practices to end child labour, moving towards a living income for farmers and caring for the environment\u201d. \u201cAnd their chocolate tastes fabulous,\u201d says Carolyn Kitto of Be Slavery Free. \u201cThey really have earned this score.\u201d Swiss brand Lindt \u2013 who oversee all parts of the chocolate manufacturing process \u2013 also scored very highly. \u201cThey have the most thorough on-the-ground farmer relationship of the big chocolate companies,\u201d says Be Slavery Free\u2019s Fuzz Kitto. Be Slavery Free have been investigating labour practices in the chocolate industry for more than two decades; and they have noticed a significant positive change in the last three years. When they ran a similar assessment in 2012, Carolyn Kitto says you could fit Australian supermarkets\u2019 ethical chocolate offerings \u201con an A5 page\u201d. \u201cNow there are so many, we have to put it up online to show them all,\u201d adds Fuzz. The guide only looks at manufacturers large enough to have their own programs, so major Australian chocolate brands like Haigh\u2019s and Darryl Lee were not included in the guide \u2013 though both are good options for Australian chocolate buyers. Fuzz notes that after a significant lobbying efforts, in the past year Darryl Lee \u201chave just done a massive turn around in Australia, it\u2019s been a phenomenal thing to watch\u201d. If you want to buy chocolate not covered in the guide, Carolyn recommends looking for certification from either the Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade or Barry Callebaut\u2019s Cocoa Horizons for an indication of better labour and environmental policies. On the other end of the spectrum, luxury American chocolate brand Godiva was slapped with a Rotten Egg Award. Because \u201cthey used other people\u2019s programs without being proactively involved in them,\u201d says Fuzz. Carolyn adds: \u201c They\u2019re basically saying they expect someone else to do the work rather than taking the responsibility themselves.\u201d Though the recent changes have been promising \u2013 particularly major manufacturers\u2019 willingness to show transparency, and engage in a dialogue with consumers \u2013 Be Slavery Free says there is still a long way to go in ridding chocolate of its bitter elements. \u201cWe are continually saying \u2018you\u2019ve got these programs, show us the results\u2019\u201d says Fuzz. \u201cThere\u2019s not been an on-the-ground assessment or baseline for us to know what the improvements are. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve been pushing for.\u201d The organisation is particularly focused on fighting poverty, by ensuring cocoa farmers are paid a living wage. Fuzz explains: \u201cHow do we get them a decent price for their cocoa so they don\u2019t have to use their children for labour?\u201d Further regulation, with real consequences for non-compliance, is also a major area for improvement. In Australia, the Modern Slavery Act requires entities with an annual consolidated revenue of more than $100m to \u201creport annually on the risks of modern slavery in their operations and supply chains, and actions to address those risks.\u201d However, Fuzz notes \u201cthe difficulty is that ... although it\u2019s mandatory to report, there\u2019s no consequences if you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t regard that we actually have a mandatory regulation scheme, because if there are no consequences, it\u2019s sort of like saying \u2018Well you have to pay tax, but if you don\u2019t, we\u2019re not going to worry about it,\u2019 \u201d Carolyn says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
