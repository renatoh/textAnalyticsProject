The court of appeal in London today ordered that the newspaper must cover McPhilemy's legal expenses under the draconian \"indemnity\" principle, which means that virtually all the fees and charges will be allowed. Normally, the losing party in such a case is only liable to pay some of the prosecution's legal costs. Mr McPhilemy won the damages over allegations that he produced a \"hoax\" programme about high-level involvement in the murder of Catholics by Northern Ireland loyalist death squads. A high court jury decided that the newspaper had failed to prove, \"on the balance of probabilities\", that the clandestine committee of murder conspirators featured in his 1991 Channel 4 programme did not exist. In its appeal, the Sunday Times claimed the jury's finding on that issue was \"perverse and unreasonable\". But Lords Justices Simon Brown, Chadwick and Longmore said the appeal, which effectively challenged the jurors' decision on the ground that they gave \"the wrong answer\", was an \"abuse\" of the court process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
