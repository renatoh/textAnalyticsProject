Almost inevitably, the moment was marked with a storm of applause around the cinema. But was the audience gathered at the film's London press show applauding out of admiration or relief? Chances are that it was a little of both. Certainly this was my own response. Because on the one hand, The Lord of the Rings is undeniably a landmark in cinema history, a creation of demented, kamikaze passion that all logic suggested should never work and yet somehow did. And on the other, I can't say I'm sad to see the back of it. There are only so many elves a man can ogle in his lifetime, only so many bravura battle scenes one can sit through, and a finite amount of cod-portentous dialogue one can endure without wanting to plug your ears with cement. \"The stars are veiled,\" intones Legolas. \"Something stirs in the east\". It's over and I'm glad. The last part of Jackson's trilogy is both the best and the worst of The Lord of the Rings. It begins in gripping fashion, with a crash-course biography of Gollum (Andy Serkis), perhaps the most purely engrossing of all Tolkien's characters. From here we hop into the main action of a movie which is effectively a three-and-a-bit-hour climax, as the armies of men ride into battle against the orcs and Frodo (Elijah Wood) presses towards Mount Doom with the One Ring To Rule Them All hanging heavy round his neck. The Return of the King is ablaze with brilliant set-pieces. True to the form of its predecessors, it's a picture painted across a mammoth canvas, whether pivoting around the white-tiered city of Minas Tirith or rustling up what could well be the most mesmerising, perfectly staged battle scenes that I've ever seen at the cinema (or anywhere else for that matter). Even so, the film boasts its share of intense, intimate moments too, with a pungent father-son drama between Denethor (John Noble) and his martyred son Faramir (David Wenham), and the ongoing fascination of the love-triangle that is Gollum, Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). In fact, for about four fifths of its run, I had The Return of the King confidently filed as a masterpiece - a big, stirring orchestral epic of a movie, full of blood and heroism and sacrifice and soul. The trouble is that it is also hellishly long, frequently preposterous and as humourless as a cat. By the end I couldn't help feeling that it had overstayed its welcome by a whisker. Loitering for a half-baked epilogue, it bows out with a whimper, not a bang. Perhaps it simply comes down to a case of tone and taste. For me, The Lord of the Rings is at its best when it's heaping all manner of Job-like torments upon the heads of its inhabitants. I have more of a problem with the sentimental swill that comes along with it: the chivalric embraces, hearty laughter, dancing hobbits and oh-so-many tearful declarations of love and loyalty. And yet this (obviously) is where the tale ends up. So the round door shuts and the applause begins, and outside in Leicester Square, the fans are pressed behind the barricades and pleading for the souvenir programmes. In the meantime Jackson, his cast and crew can settle back and reflect on the magnitude of their achievements. Despite its flaws, The Return of the King is a rich and rousing finale to one of the great sagas of our age. Because in the end I do think there is a greatness to this trilogy. It has captivated us in a way that most other movies can only dream of, conjured up a world and made it real. But now it is over, finished, kaput. Now, at long last, we can move on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
