The Brownlees were competing in the final race of triathlon\u2019s World Series in Mexico, where victory in a stiflingly humid Cozumel with their main rival \u2013 Spain\u2019s Mario Mola \u2013 finishing no higher than fourth, would have made Jonny world champion. That looked on the cards after the brothers had again pushed the pace hard on the swimming and cycling segments until the final stages of the 10km run, which ended the day\u2019s event, when the clear leader started to wobble. Third-placed Alistair, who was out of contention for overall victory himself, spotted his brother weaving across the course before stopping at the side of the road. He put his arm around Jonny and all but carried him for the final few hundred metres, before pushing him across the line for second place. Mola took the title, but the younger Brownlee then had to survive an appeal to disqualify him lodged by the Spanish triathlon federation, which also had an athlete in third spot, for accepting assistance to get over the line. The appeal was dismissed by the International Triathlon Union, citing a rule that states athletes may accept help from fellow competitors, but Jonny still got a ticking off for his pains. \u201cI wish the flipping idiot had just paced it right and won the race,\u201d said Alastair, the two-times Olympic champion. \u201cHe could have jogged the last 2km.\u201d Jonny Brownlee required treatment but later, accompanied by a photo of himself lying in a hospital bed on a drip, tweeted that he was OK: \u201cNot the way I wanted to end the season. Thanks @Alibrownleetri, your loyalty is incredible.\u201d Alistair, who also collapsed with exhaustion in Hyde Park in 2010 at the end of a triathlon, said: \u201cIf it happened to anyone I would have helped them across the line because it\u2019s an awful position to be in. If he\u2019d conked out before the finish line and there wasn\u2019t medical support it could have been really dangerous. \u201cIt was a natural human reaction to my brother but for anyone I would have done the same thing. I think it\u2019s as close to death as you can be in sport.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
