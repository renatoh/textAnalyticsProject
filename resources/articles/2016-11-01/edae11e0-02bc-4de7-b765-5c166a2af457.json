Chris Coleman\u2019s players are ready to assemble in a new formation in front of the cameras as part of a joke and the belief that it brings them good fortune. The bizarre team pictures started more by accident than design and go back several years, but of late the Wales players have made a conscious effort to break with the traditional six-plus-five setup for the shot that is taken just before kick-off. Before the 2-2 draw with Austria in Vienna last month, Wales lined up for their team photo with four players at the front and seven at the back. They then took it a step further before the Georgia game three days later, when the back row consisted of only Ashley Williams and Sam Vokes standing either side of Wayne Hennessey. Wales, however, are not finished there. \u201cYou can go further than that, so let\u2019s wait and see,\u201d Joe Ledley said, smiling. The Crystal Palace midfielder admitted that the idea came about by accident. \u201cAt first we didn\u2019t look into it but then gradually a few photos got together and it was awful. So we just thought we may as well keep it the same. We don\u2019t practise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just talk within the group and we decide what we\u2019re going to do. We will probably continue it \u2013 it\u2019s been lucky for us, so I don\u2019t think we will have a proper photo.\u201d It was pointed out to Ledley that James Chester also had his hand on Dave Edwards\u2019 knee in the last team photo. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Ledley said, looking a little surprised. \u201cI think he\u2019s taken it a bit too far. That wasn\u2019t in the meeting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
