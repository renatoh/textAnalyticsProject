In November, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and in December my surgeon said I should cancel the holiday as I could be having treatment during that period. Virgin said I could change the flights and that the fee for making a change could be waived if I was having treatment on the day of the flight. The next time I phoned, a different person told me that, unless I was actually going to be in hospital overnight on the day of travel, the fee could not be waived. Later I was told that I could not change the flights as the new dates are more than a year from the booking date. At no time previously had I been told this. If I cancel they will not refund the cost of the flight. AN, London Virgin says its terms and conditions differentiate between in-patients and out-patients but this is particularly restrictive now that hospitals avoid keeping patients in overnight as much as possible, and obviously you still can't fly while you are having out-patient treatment. However, it has given greater sympathy to your circumstances and agreed to refund the \u00a3100 it charged to amend your ticket and \u00a3300 for the difference in cost of the air fares which is high because you will be travelling at Easter, a more expensive time of year.
