The survey for Mitel Networks discovered that of office workers who cannot currently work from home, 40% would seriously consider moving jobs, and more than 25% would even take a cut in salary, to be able to work from home. The survey found that 41% of workers rate travel as the most annoying aspect of their job followed by office politics at 37%, with 33% finding constant interruptions maddening. A quarter of office workers surveyed spend between one and two hours travelling each day and 15% are late to work between one and three times a week owing to travel delays. Mitel Networks has produced a guide to Survival in the Workplace that deals with stressful aspects of working life, from coping with commuting and heavy workloads, to dealing with the constant barrage of messages, and offers advice on how to tackle each area.
