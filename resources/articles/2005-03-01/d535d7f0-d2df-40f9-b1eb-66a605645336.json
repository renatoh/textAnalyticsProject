Moutaz Almallah Dabas, 39, was arrested on an extradition warrant issued by the Spanish authorities. He was held in Slough and will appear at Bow Street magistrates court in central London on Monday. Moutaz Almallah Dabas, who has Spanish nationality, was held 24 hours after his brother Mohannad Almallah Dabas, a Syrian national, was arrested in Madrid. The Spanish Interior Ministry accuses them of being linked to the recruitment of young Islamic radicals in Spain. It claims they used an apartment in Madrid to house recruits, or people passing through. They are alleged to have been helped by Basel Ghalyoun, a Syrian already jailed for a suspected role in the Madrid bombings. The ministry also claims the apartment was used for meetings, some of which were attended by a Tunisian called Serhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet. Fakhet was one of seven prime suspects for the bombings who killed themselves in a suicide blast on April 3 last year as police closed in. Mohannad Almallah Dabas was first arrested a fortnight after the March 11 attack but was released. The Dabas brothers are also said to be linked to Rabei Osman Ahmed, an Egyptian who was extradited from Italy to Spain last December and is alleged to be a key figure in the Madrid attacks. The Spanish Interior Ministry also claims that Mohannad Almallah Dabas was linked to Imad Yarkas, a Syrian-born Spaniard currently in custody charged with providing financial and logistical support for the September 11 attacks. A total of 191 people were killed in the Madrid bombings and more than 1,500 injured. So far in the huge investigation a total of 22 people, many of them Moroccan, have been jailed. More than 50 others have been held and released and are still considered suspects by investigators. Al Qaida-inspired militants have claimed responsibility for the attack. A Scotland Yard source said: \"Moutaz Almallah Dabas was arrested under a European arrest warrant issued by the Spanish authorities for alleged terrorist offences, in particular involvement in the Madrid bombings.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
