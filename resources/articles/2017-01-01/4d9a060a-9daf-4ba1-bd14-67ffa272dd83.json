On Friday he described himself as \u201cmaybe not good enough\u201d for Manchester City, a clear indication of the pressure he is feeling, and on Saturday he faces the Premier League\u2019s most in-form team in a game he can ill afford to lose. This was not how he nor City had envisaged the season unfolding when he finally took charge in the summer following the club\u2019s four-year pursuit of him. Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 with seven consecutive wins, achieved with a goal difference of +18 \u2013 are Saturday\u2019s opponents at the Etihad and should City lose to Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team then a top-four finish becomes even harder, never mind winning the league. City are fifth after last Sunday\u2019s 4-0 defeat at Everton, two points off a Champions League berth. The league position is not Guardiola\u2019s sole concern, though. Claudio Bravo continues to be a liability. The goalkeeper was culpable again at Everton and his confidence appears shot. Yet Guardiola does not blame Bravo. Instead, he says the Chilean is suffering because of poor defending, part of the Guardiola mantra that City\u2019s underlying ill is due to not being strong either at the back or up front. As for the attacking concern, Guardiola\u2019s appraisal is that City\u2019s finishing is not the \u201cmachine\u201d of the other challengers, which can be read as a dig at the lone striker, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, despite 18 goals in 23 outings across all competitions. Guardiola\u2019s statement on Friday that he is possibly not of the requisite standard came when he was asked if City\u2019s players are as good as those he coached at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. \u201cMaybe I am not good enough for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are Manchester City players, they have a lot of quality. They showed that many times in the past and this season. I have respect for the guys, so why would I say the guys are not good? I don\u2019t understand the lack of respect for the professionals when they are amazing players and [the question suggests] they are not good enough for me.\u201d His focus on Saturday\u2019s game may have caused a misunderstanding, as the question was not whether his players are good enough per se but if they are on the same level as Lionel Messi, Xavi, Arjen Robben and others at his previous clubs. This is the manager who has a league title for six of his seven full seasons as a head coach. His Bar\u00e7a side are considered among the finest in the game\u2019s history. At Bayern, refinement of his carousel passing game to utilise the full-back Philipp Lahm as a midfielder pointed to a far-sighted football intelligence. Yet in Friday\u2019s briefing Guardiola claimed his arrival was over-hyped, saying: \u201cMaybe the expectations about my coming here were so excessive, now you realise your [media] commentary was so exaggerated, maybe our 10 games in a row, winning games and maybe the people expected that that was how good we were. \u201cSo the reality is that we were going to build up and I am working on that and then I will be the first to recognise if I am not able or we are not able to do that and speak with the club to make a solution.\u201d Guardiola has been consistent in saying that he moved to English football to challenge himself. City\u2019s current predicament is doing precisely that. \u201cI would prefer to be at the top but it\u2019s not the situation. I want to handle that \u2013 it\u2019s the first time,\u201d he said. One of the statistics Guardiola and Bravo have to contemplate is that the No1 has saved only eight of the last 22 shots. For the moment, however, the Chilean will not be dropped. \u201cWhen I think there is a problem I will consider, but at the moment he is still in goal,\u201d said Guardiola. Regarding how to handle Bravo\u2019s bad form Guardiola added: \u201cIt is to be as close as possible to [the player]. I am still convinced he\u2019s a good goalkeeper. I never say the reason why we lost is because of Claudio Bravo. It\u2019s one of the reasons why, but there are many reasons why. So when Lukaku for Everton scored the first goal, for example, we had already had three or four clear chances one-against-one with their goalkeeper.\u201d Guardiola continues to offer mixed messages about Ag\u00fcero. On Thursday night he was photographed having dinner with the Argentinian and his agent. The manager denied this was to discuss the player\u2019s contract and City confirmed on Friday that his current deal ends in 2020. The striker, though, is still to score against a top-seven side, and Guardiola said: \u201cHe knows that, I know that, but we don\u2019t discuss it. We have to try to help him to score against the top teams. Of course he wants to score and sometimes he had the chances.\u201d The manager criticised Ag\u00fcero for misses in December\u2019s 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea. \u201cWe can review Chelsea \u2013 he had the chances,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cLast game [Everton], the cross for Sergio but nothing, he did not arrive there. I don\u2019t know other managers, but to give some advice in the box to score a goal, it\u2019s so difficult to do this because it depends on the quality of the players. For example, Ag\u00fcero\u2019s goal against Burnley [in January], it\u2019s almost impossible to do it \u2013 that shows his talent.\u201d For now, Guardiola has to continue the search for a solution to City\u2019s costly achilles heel. \u201cIt is because we have chances but we don\u2019t score,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big teams score, they have the quality and they are machines \u2013 but that is the most difficult thing to achieve. When they get into our box we concede. The first few times: \u2018Oh, it was unlucky.\u2019 Then: \u2018No, it was not unlucky.\u2019 Something happened and we are thinking about how to correct that.\u201d In October\u2019s reverse fixture Spurs gave City a 2-0 schooling at White Hart Lane. City dare not lose again on Saturday, particularly in similar fashion. Yet whether a win will correct the deep fault-lines in Guardiola\u2019s side remains debatable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
