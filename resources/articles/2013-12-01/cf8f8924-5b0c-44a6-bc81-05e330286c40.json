Unnamed senior government ministers told ABC\u2019s Lateline on Thursday that Holden will cease operating in Australia after 65 years of production. A Productivity Commission report into the future of the automotive industry is underway, with preliminary findings expected on 20 December and the final report on 31 March, and a decision on government funding was expected to influence Holden\u2019s decision to stay. Citing \u201cseveral senior government figures\u201d, ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann said Holden intends to quit Australia \u201cas early as 2016\u201d, regardless of the report, if the government does not make a decision before Christmas. The closure would take with it about 1,700 jobs in South Australia and up to 50,000 in knock-on effects around the country. Industry minister Ian Macfarlane denied any such decision had been made, a statement backed up by the opposition\u2019s industry spokesman, Kim Carr. ACTU national secretary Dave Oliver told Guardian Australia the council is \u201cextremely disappointed that we\u2019ve now got government ministers backgrounding journalists on the demise of Holden when no such decision has been made\u201d. \u201cThis is now creating a lot of uncertainty across the industry and more importantly a lot of uncertainty for the Holden workers who are waking up to the news this morning that they may have lost their jobs, when that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Oliver. He said the prime minister now had an opportunity to \u201cput money where his mouth is\u201d and announce co-investment to secure Holden and the auto industry. \u201cThe prime minister has a choice. He can simply stand by on the sidelines and wait for a Productivity Commission inquiry that could turn into a Productivity Commission inquest, or come out now before Christmas [and] make the announcement that he\u2019s prepared to make the funding that will secure the tens of thousands of jobs in Holden and the associated supply industry,\u201d said Oliver. Carr told reporters in Canberra on Friday morning that the prime minister has \u201creal responsibilities\u201d to intervene personally. He said that the government has done \u201call they can to avoid making a decision\u201d on funding Holden, and called for it to deliver certainty to the industry. \u201cThere\u2019s been no formal decision made at this point, but the whole issue is on a knife edge,\u201d said Carr. Carr said he was in no doubt that if Labor had won the election, contracts would have been signed by now. He said a deal had been done under Labor with the company but it wasn\u2019t signed off because Holden wanted to hold off until after the election. \u201cThe government has known for a long time what the timetable is,\u201d he said. In June, Fairfax reported General Motors Holden director of government affairs Matt Hobbs saying that without further financial assistance beyond 2020 from the government, GMH would pull out. In a submission to the Productivity Commission, Holden said a globally competitive, long-term policy was needed to keep Australian automotive manufacturing alive. \"Without public assistance, Holden's local manufacturing cannot compete globally,\" the submission said. South Australian senator Nick Xenophon told ABC on Friday morning that if Holden quit \u201cthe supply chain would collapse\u201d. \u201cOther countries give a lot more assistance per capita to the automotive industry because they see the advantage in having a viable automotive industry,\u201d he said. \u201c$2bn is a lot of money over 10 years but what is the cost of welfare payments that the government would have to dish out?\u201d he said, referencing the potential 50,000 job losses. The prime minister\u2019s office and General Motors were contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
