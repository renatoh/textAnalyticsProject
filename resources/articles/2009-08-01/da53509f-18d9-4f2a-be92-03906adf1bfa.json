But he probably wasn't expecting it to be quite this quiet: he and his family now find themselves the sole residents of a 32-storey, 200-unit building. Life in Oasis Tower I, as it's known, is more than quiet; it's a little bit post-Apocalyptic. The Florida building boom was already going bust when Vangelakos closed the deal on his condo last November. By then, most other prospective tenants had either got cold feet, or found themselves unable to secure a mortgage. Those few that did close a deal were moved next door, to the less rarefied environs of Oasis Tower II, but Vangelakos's lender (he has a $336,000 mortgage on the property) wouldn't allow him to switch. There is, of course, an upside to living alone in a giant luxury tower block. The Vangelakos family have the pool and the gym to themselves. They have exclusive use of the well-appointed clubhouse, although they can't watch the huge plasma TV because they can't find the remote. The downside is that it's really, really, creepy. The only friendly voice they ever hear is the lift, which greets their arrival home with a cheery, if robotic, \"going up\". But they do sometimes hear strange noises in the night; security is non-existent. Someone pounded on their door at 11pm once, and one morning they awoke to find all the sun loungers in the pool. The marina, restaurants and cinema that were meant to be part of the development have not been built. Vangelakos wants the developer to buy back the condo, but it isn't interested. Nothing, it seems, can save the Vangelakos family from their lonely plight, not even publicity. Soon after their story hit the headlines, it emerged that Vangelakos's wife, Cathy, was facing embezzlement charges back in New Jersey. If convicted she could face up to 10 years in prison; by then, though, she may be glad of the company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
