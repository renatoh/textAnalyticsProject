Convoys of British and US tanks and fighting vehicles snaked through sandstorms in the Kuwaiti desert today, taking up positions on the Iraqi border. One major deployment involved the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division of 20,000 soldiers and thousands of vehicles. The Pentagon said British and American warplanes bombed 10 Iraqi artillery positions in the southern no-fly zone tonight, all near the border with Kuwait and in range of the invasion force. Allied planes have carried out regular strikes in response to Iraqi anti-aircraft fire since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, however the attacks have been stepped in recent days to prepare the way for a large scale invasion. It also seemed tonight that the millions of leaflets dropped on Iraq by US and British forces, warning Iraqi soldiers to surrender, may be having an effect. The US claimed that 17 Iraqi soldiers surrendered to allied forces in northern Kuwait tonight. David Sharrock, of The Times, reported that, in northern Iraq, on the border with the Kurdish autonomous region, up to three-quarters of some Iraqi regiments had already fled. In the mainly Shia Muslim south, Kuwaiti border guards are having to turn Iraqi soldiers back, telling them that they must wait until the attack begins before they can surrender, he said. On board the British warship Ark Royal, the bar closed its doors and beer rations were cancelled in preparation for the attack, Reuters reported. The Associated Press said that troops on board the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt were told to sleep during today to be alert for night flights. Meanwhile, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, appeared at a press conference in Baghdad to quash rumours that he had defected to northern Iraq, or been shot while trying to flee. What is certain is that there are only a few hours remaining before the US ultimatum to the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, to flee the country reaches its deadline at 0115 GMT tomorrow. Baghdad has unequivocally rejected it. Some US officials have been reminding reporters that the US president, George Bush, said the US would invade at a \"time of our choosing\", and that there was a longer than expected delay before the attack on Afghanistan. The demilitarised zone where allied troops massed today extends three miles into Kuwait, and six miles into Iraq. UN observers pulled out of the area on Monday, and small groups of military engineers last week cut gates in the zone's fence. Mr Bush has said that President Saddam and his two sons must leave Iraq by early tomorrow (Baghdad time), or the country will face invasion by some 280,000 US and British forces in the Gulf. The troops are backed by around 1,000 warplanes. The top US naval commander in the Gulf today told sailors that war on Iraq was \"very likely\" within a couple of days, Reuters has reported. Vice-Admiral Timothy Keating said that there might be only a limited element of surprise in the timing, but US forces would make up for that with unprecedented speed. Fierce sandstorms in parts of the Kuwaiti desert, with winds of up to 20mph, have cut visibility to just a few feet, raising concerns that they may delay or hamper the impending military action. The skies are expected to clear overnight, but a CNN meteorologist said that even stronger winds are forecast for tomorrow. Iraq's parliament convened today to proclaim support for President Saddam, and the Iraqi information minister, Muhammed Saeed Sahaf, said that the US was deceiving its soldiers by saying \"invading Iraq will be like a picnic\". He said: \"This is a very stupid lie ... what they are facing is a definite death.\" Sandstorms threaten to delay allied invasion France, Russia and Germany condemn military action Germany, France and Russia today condemned military action from the floor of the UN security council. The foreign ministers of all three countries expressed outrage that the work of the UN weapons inspectors had been cut short by the impending war. The French foreign minister, Dominic de Villepin said that the war would precipitate more international terrorism. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said it was still possible to peacefully disarm Iraq, and that Berlin therefore \"emphatically rejected\" war. However, the harshest criticism came from Russia, whose foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said: \"Not one of these decisions authorises the right to use force against Iraq. Not one of them authorises violent overthrow of a sovereign state.\" Blair warns Iraqi leadership will be 'held to account' The prime minister, Tony Blair, today warned the Iraqi leadership that they would be \"held accountable\" by Britain and the US once war was over. After last night's Commons vote, which gave overwhelming support for military action despite a rebellion by 139 Labour MPs, Mr Blair told MPs the time had come for the house to rally behind British troops. With military action potentially just hours away, he urged MPs to unite in \"wishing them well and wishing them safety\". Blair promises 'brighter and better' Iraq Blair battles on after record rebellion Germany expels Iraqi diplomats and grants flyover rights Germany's foreign ministry said that four Iraqi diplomats had been ordered to leave the country for activities \"incompatible with their diplomatic status\". The move follows similar expulsions in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Australia, Romania, the Philippines and the US. Germany today also guaranteed US and British forces flyover rights, despite its opposition to an attack and warnings that military action may breach international law. Turkey's government said that it would ask parliament to grant the US air force the right to use Turkish airspace tomorrow. However, it would not immediately ask for a vote on allowing in US troops, a move which would open up a northern front against Iraq. This may be possible later. Saudi's Saddam exile proposal rejected Saudi Arabia has urged the Iraqi leader and his family to go into exile to avert a war, though Riyadh itself did not offer to take him. The Iraqi parliament said it was \"unthinkable\" for President Saddam to leave the country. Later, Bahrain offered him sanctuary. Weapons inspector: 'US gave us wrong data' A UN weapons inspector who returned from Iraq yesterday said today that the US had given them wrong and misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Jorn Siljeholm, 48, a Norwegian scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spent 100 days in Iraq as part of the UN inspections team. He told the Associated Press that assertions by US officials, including the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, about Iraq's arsenal and its attempts to hide it, did not tally with his own findings. \"None of their hot tips were ever confirmed,\" he said, adding: \"I don't know about a single decontamination truck that didn't turn out to be a fire engine or a water truck.\" Blix doubts Iraq will use chemical weapons The chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, said he does not believe that Iraq will use chemical or biological weapons during a war, although it has the ability to produce warheads and the deadly agents to fill them. Mr Blix said that the scepticism about the war \"would turn immediately around if they used chemical weapons or biological weapons\". Pentagon officials in Washington have warned that the Iraqi leader has given field-level commanders the authority to use chemical weapons on their own initiative without further orders from Baghdad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
