The festival, which began so promisingly with Music Theatre Wales's scalp-tingling production of Peter Maxwell Davies's The Lighthouse, and numbered among its highlights Colin Davis's sublime St Matthew Passion, was entitled to a firework or two at its close. Mark-Anthony Turnage's A Quick Blast, for woodwind, brass and percussion - the first part of a planned orchestral trilogy for the BBC Symphony Orchestra - could have provided exactly the right kind of brilliant showpiece. The writing is full of typical Turnage virtuosity: superbly judged, sharply coloured orchestration, visceral rhythmic excitement and plenty of short, punchy motifs that stick in the memory. But the title is deceptive. A lot happens in A Quick Blast's compressed 10-minute span. From the performance I would guess that it needed at least one more rehearsal. The young Scottish pianist Steven Osborne's playing in Ravel's G major Piano Concerto was more disappointing. This was a performance that skimmed the surface and left few ripples. In the opening movement's bluesy second theme, and in the gorgeous quiet solo that starts the slow movement, Osborne's fat, strongly projected tone felt out of place - Brahms in Paris. There was controlled energy, but little panache, delicacy or magic. Surprisingly it was Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony that saved the evening - surprisingly because inspired performances of this old warhorse are rare in this country. Conductor Martyn Brabbins had evidently thought and worked hard over the symphony. Nothing was taken for granted. Every phrase was shaped carefully, tempos were well-judged, each important solo came across clearly, and the string sound was rounded and rich. Most impressive of all was Brabbins's grasp of the work as a whole - the way the slow movement develops and intensifies the drama of the first movement, and the finale's determination to exult in the face of darkness.
