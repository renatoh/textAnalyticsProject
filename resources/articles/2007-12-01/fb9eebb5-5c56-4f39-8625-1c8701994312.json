Fireworks lit up the night sky over his hometown of Butte, Montana, with bursts of his trademark red, white and blue when the hearse carrying his body arrived in the town on Sunday. Pictures of Knievel were shown on a big screen and a sound system blared country music and Frank Sinatra's My Way. Knievel, who suffered from pulmonary fibrosis and diabetes, died on November 30 in Florida, aged 69.

The crocodiles attacked as people fetched water, washed clothes or fished in the Chinde river. \"Something must be done to prevent the deaths in the river,\" Antonio Portugal, who said his uncle was killed by crocodiles, told state television. The authorities in the northwestern province of Tete, where crocodiles are also blamed for many deaths, have launched a campaign to collect crocodile eggs along the Zambezi river to control the reptiles' population.

Vick, 27, told the court: \"I would like to apologise to the court, to my family, to my kids, for what I have done.\" Associated Press in Richmond"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
