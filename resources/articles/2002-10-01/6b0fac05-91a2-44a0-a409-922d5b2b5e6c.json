Some need it, some don't. I never had to smack Heidi. I've had five children, two of whom I had to smack. The other three didn't need it. Children come up against dangerous things all the time and sometimes a tap on the hand can serve as a warning. Heidi, mother: I don't think a ban would be constructive. It could be abused by absolute terrors, while not protecting those children who need it. Anyway, how could they monitor it? Would they take the child's word? An accusation of smacking might be blown out of all proportion and affect people it's not really aimed at. I don't like to see anyone getting hit but when they're young and not able to understand more subtle punishments, then a slap on the legs can teach right from wrong. As they get older there are other ways. Once children are six or seven, talking to them has more impact. I don't smack the girls, but if I had a horror on my hands then I might. Mike, father: One reason to ban smacking would be the amount of child abuse you hear about. A ban might stop that, especially if the punishments were strong enough, like a big fine going to a good cause such as a children's charity. On the other hand, if a child has done something wrong, then they deserve a smack to let them know they're out of line. You often see parents losing their tempers in shops, then the child gets a smack and all eyes are on you. All children test their parents and parents should control their tempers. Zoe, 13: The government should ban smacking because it can become routine and hurt the child. Smacking could turn to beating, which can cause injuries or death. I would never like to be smacked. Parents can come up with better solutions. Kirsty, 10: Smacking should be banned because it can hurt. I think the punishment should be something like being made to stay in your room or not being allowed to go to your friend's house or play outside for a week. \u00b7 If your family would like to be asked a question, contact ask.the.family@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
