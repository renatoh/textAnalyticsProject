That did not require much imagination. Rival Eon jumped last week and politicians of all stripes have been calling for reductions to reflect falling wholesale prices, which are down 30% on a year ago. The 5% cut (delayed for five weeks, note) was accompanied by a lecture on how utilities\u2019 forward-purchasing agreements mean retail prices lag behind the lower wholesale gas price. It\u2019s a fair point, of course, and there is no reason to doubt the company\u2019s contention that most of the gas being used in homes today was bought at higher 2013/14 prices. But if Conn thinks he\u2019s bought himself some political breathing space, he should think again. The debate about the cost of energy will not disappear as the general election approaches. Tories are having fun portraying Ed Miliband\u2019s price-freeze pledge as a cock-up that has prevented prices from falling sooner. Labour is recasting the \u201cfreeze\u201d as a \u201ccap\u201d and wants the regulator to be able to command prices. The rhetoric will continue to roll. For Centrica investors, it plays to a related debate: will Conn\u2019s second major act be to cut the dividend? Full-year results come next month, and the numbers will be tight after last year\u2019s profit warnings. Earnings per share will be about 19p versus a dividend of 17.5p if Conn continues down his predecessor\u2019s path. Such skimpy cover doesn\u2019t leave much room for investment. Or does it? In the bulls\u2019 corner, Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyst argued last week that the dividend ought to be safe because Conn has self-help measures at his disposal, such as cost-cutting: \u201cWe question why Centrica seems less efficient than peers,\u201d he said. In any case, it says, the dividend is covered by free cashflow. Bank of America Merrill Lynch disagrees. It doubts that a new strategy can emerge until the election is over and after the Competition and Markets Authority has spoken in the summer. Meanwhile, Centrica\u2019s other cogs, such as upstream gas and power generation, are spinning more slowly. The bank expects a 15% dividend in a year\u2019s time, but thinks next month\u2019s results \u201cwill disappoint those anticipating a message of hope, and could highlight the harsh reality of asset writedowns\u201d. Conn is in a tight spot. The dividend yield has soared to 6.6% with the tumble in the share price from 400p, when Miliband made his \u201cfreeze\u201d speech in 2013, to 265p. The new boss is an outsider from BP and his chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, is also fresh(ish) to the job. If you want to reset expectations, do it early, runs the old wisdom. A slightly lower, but safer, dividend would not be the end of the world. And it might be pragmatic to send a message to Westminster that Centrica shareholders aren\u2019t swimming in cash. Conn must be tempted. Meet John Laing III The stock market will soon be awash with John Laings. There is already a John Laing Infrastructure Fund, which likes owning schools and hospitals and is the one that made a cheeky bid for Balfour Beatty\u2019s portfolio of such assets. Then there is John Laing Environment, whose gig is renewable energy projects. Now comes John Laing Group, from which the others sprang under the ownership of fund manager Henderson. What\u2019s the difference? The first two try to be steady dividend machines, currently sporting 5%-plus yields, who own completed projects where the risk (they hope) has been removed. John Laing Group offers a racier life. It originates, develops and manages infrastructure projects, as well as owning a few. That carries more potential reward, but also more risk, even if it shoves cost overruns on to subcontractors. On the plus side, the group says it has generated annual returns of 23%-25% from the public-private projects it has exited since 2007. Very nice. The promise is more of the same and capital growth as taxpayers around the globe are treated to the dubious delights of public-private partnerships. The drawback is a dividend that looks downright mean for an infrastructure business. The group says it will distribute a \u201cbase\u201d dividend of \u00a320m, to be juiced up with special dividends after disposals. But at \u00a31bn, the rumoured top-of-the-range valuation, the \u201cbase\u201d yield would be only 2%. Either the specials will have to be very special, or the \u00a31bn price tag is too pushy. Net assets are \u00a3630m, plus \u00a3130m of new money to be raised. A price closer to \u00a3800m looks more doable. Hollande\u2019s debt slip \u201cOn Thursday, the European Central Bank will take the decision to buy sovereign debt,\u201d French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said in the morning. By the afternoon, his office had downgraded this remark to \u201ctheoretical\u201d. Hollande was naughty to jump the gun, but what part of his statement could possibly be described as theoretical? If it\u2019s the word \u201cThursday\u201d, there\u2019ll be trouble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
