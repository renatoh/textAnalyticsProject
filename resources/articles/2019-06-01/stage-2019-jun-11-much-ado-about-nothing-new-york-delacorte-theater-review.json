Or maybe several wars. In Much Ado About Nothing, at Shakespeare in the Park, Don Pedro and his corps have just returned from battle. That so many of the maroon-outfitted soldiers are carrying signs like \u201cI Am a Person\u201d and \u201cRestore Democracy Now\u201d suggests that they are campaigning for an acknowledgment of a shared humanity. And over at Leonato\u2019s McMansion, where these soldiers have arrived for some needed R&amp;R, men and women are fighting, dirty and clean, for the same thing, though with a lot more dance breaks. Much Ado is a comedy entangled in a tragedy, Kenny Leon\u2019s uneven, exuberant production, at war with itself, rarely knows where to aim. Danielle Brooks, a star of Orange Is the New Black, leads the all-black cast as Beatrice. (Why an all-black cast? Why not?) Messina, a Sicilian port, has been recast as an Atlanta suburb. On the balcony of Leonato\u2019s house, its grounds studded with peach trees, Brooks stands on a balcony, wailing Marvin Gaye\u2019s What\u2019s Going On (Juilliard-trained, Brooks has a gorgeous, growly alto). The song then joins, uneasily, with America the Beautiful. A Shakespeare comedy has to find a way to bring some lovin\u2019 here today, so Don Pedro\u2019s co-ed company enters, a unit that includes Benedick (Grantham Coleman with a Kanye-esque bleach job), Beatrice\u2019s ex, and Claudio (Jeremie Harris), the beloved of Beatrice\u2019s cousin, Hero (Margaret Odette). Predictably, the course of true love needs some serious repaving. Hero and Claudio are thwarted by a dastardly, bastardly plot, courtesy of Hubert Point-Du Jour\u2019s trim, fiendish Don John. Beatrice and Benedick have no one to blame but their lippy, stubborn selves. So it\u2019s up to the other characters to dupe them into ardor. If neither couple has particular chemistry, the leads are individually attractive and mostly charismatic, though this is very much Brooks\u2019s show. When the play\u2019s energy flags \u2013 as it often does between dance numbers, because Leon doesn\u2019t wholly trust the verse \u2013 she boosts it pretty much on her own, with big energy and big gestures and big facial expressions. She is grandstanding, sure, but she is also listening and responding to her castmates. She has at least three distinct varieties of side eye. The busy production rarely relaxes into itself, at least when people are talking. The best moments are when the whole cast assembles and Camille A Brown, the splendid choreographer who also created the step dances for Choir Boy, playfully sets them shaking. Leon has made some of the comedy too broad (the night watch, which wallows in stereotype) and some of it not broad enough. Coleman, commanding and sensitive in Choir Boy, does not initially seem down to clown, but he gets there. Any genuine production of Much Ado About Nothing has to deal with the darkness at its core, the idea that one wrong word, one wrong action, could render a woman worthless, better dead than alive \u2013 at least that\u2019s what her own father (Chuck Cooper, occasionally struggling with the lines) insists. The \u201cNothing\u201d in the title is Elizabethan street speak for vagina and whether or not one particular vagina still has its hymen intact is a major plot point. Leon seems to acknowledge it only fitfully, until a final, capricious gesture sweeps it away entirely. The ending moments undermine the production, asking how much any particular bond or relationship can matter in the context of a larger conflict. Plenty, if you\u2019re asking me. Leon seems to see it differently. \u201cOnly love can conquer hate,\u201d Brooks sings in a reprise. But the other characters have left the stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
