World Rugby has set up a working group to look into the global calendar and explore ways to make it more synchronised. The timing of every tournament will be looked at although Ritchie said he would have to be convinced that moving the Six Nations back even a few weeks so matches started in March would be beneficial. \u201cYou\u2019d be a very courageous person to move the Six Nations to a significant degree, because it\u2019s a winning formula,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is successful because of where it fits in the sporting calendar, how it works and people\u2019s understanding of where it works. \u201cWe sold out every game, we have just had a record television audience for a Six Nations match and it works well for the fans. Last weekend was mind-blowing and you would need a lot of persuading to change what works. It is not something that will be looked at in isolation because we are talking about the global calendar and there will be no change to it until after the 2019 World Cup in Japan.\u201d Player welfare is at the heart of the RFU\u2019s input into talks on a global season and a reason why Twickenham will take some convincing that the Premiership should increase from 12 to 14 clubs. Ritchie said: \u201cWe need to make sure we are doing everything we can in terms of giving players appropriate recovery and recuperation time.\u201d Ritchie has been meeting with Premiership Rugby about a new elite player agreement with the current deal ending next year. He hopes it will be signed before the World Cup, but one debating point will be the size of the Premiership and whether relegation should be suspended with the clubs arguing for both from the 2016-17 season. \u201cWe have to find the right balance between the RFU and the clubs,\u201d he said when asked if Premiership Rugby was becoming too powerful. \u201cI understand elements of the clubs saying this is our business and we want to control it. On the other hand, we are looking at what is best for the game and how it works with the England team. \u201cWe are in the middle of discussions with Premiership Rugby and I do not want to say too much. Player welfare will be one of the factors we look at when talking about the size of the Premiership, although we have not had a formal proposal from the clubs. It goes back to how many games can you expect somebody to play in a season, particularly at the top end, not just how many international but how many club matches. \u201cThere is a call in France to reduce the Top 14 to 12 and it is a complex issue. These things are usually a balance between economics and player welfare. The perfect solution would be to play fewer matches and make more money: trying to find that is as true of the domestic as the global season. \u201cAs for ring-fencing, and I am not sure we are talking about it per se, who would have thought Exeter would now be in the position they are in? You like the idea that somebody can aspire and grow while also wanting a highly competitive Premiership. Things are never absolute: there is always compromise along the way.\u201d Ritchie said this week that England\u2019s failure to win the Six Nations since the last World Cup was unacceptable, but he was able to take consolation from putting 55 points against France last Saturday. \u201cI do not think I have ever been through such a rollercoaster day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went backwards and forwards from the first game in Rome and you could not turn your back. I was a nervous wreck by the end. It was desperately disappointing for us, but for the sports fan it was incredible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
