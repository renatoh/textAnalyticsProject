Bolt\u2019s comments mark his most scathing public criticism of former rival Gay, who tested positive for a banned steroid in 2013 and was subsequently given a one-year ban by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which was reduced from two years after Gay offered substantial assistance to investigating authorities. \u201cThe message should be: \u2018If you cheat, you\u2019re going to be kicked out of the sport,\u2019\u201d said Bolt in an interview with Runner\u2019s World. \u201cYou have to drive fear into athletes, to make them think about the consequences of their actions. If they\u2019re getting an easy penalty why would they care?\u201d Speaking to the Guardian at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia \u2013 where he will compete in the USA vs. the World 4x100m relay on Saturday \u2013 Gatlin said that while he respects the opinion of Bolt, he is looking forward to seeing American teammate Gay getting back to the sport\u2019s top tier. \u201cThat\u2019s a fight between Tyson and Usain,\u201d Gatlin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had many battles in the past, so hopefully Tyson will come back on his A-game and it\u2019ll make a good competition. Everyone should give a second chance, but everyone is also entitled to their opinion. I can\u2019t say that what Usain has said is bad or good. It\u2019s an opinion, and everybody is entitled to their opinion, so I respect what he says.\u201d Gatlin was Olympic 100m champion in 2004 but was given a four-year ban after testing positive for testosterone in 2006. Since his comeback, he has returned to the top of the track world and finished 2014 as the top-ranked sprinter, running personal bests over 100m (9.77 seconds) and 200m (19.68) last summer. The dissenting voices he\u2019s heard since returning don\u2019t faze him in the slightest. \u201cCritics are just what they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pick at the positivity of things. I come out to do what everyone else is trying to do, which is run, run fast and win. I\u2019m not really concerned with what naysayers or critics say. I come out here to do my job and I have to prepare myself for a race and run fast.\u201d As he prepares to get his 2015 season underway, Gatlin says he feels as fast as ever. \u201cI had a great year [in 2014], an undefeated season, and I feel in the same shape,\u201d he said. \u201cI used last year as a blueprint, and I want it to be a stepping stone to do even better this year. At 33, I\u2019m still discovering my own talents. I find little flaws I have in practice, I work on those and go to the gym or I eat better.\u201d After this weekend, Gatlin\u2019s next race will be at the IAAF World Relays in the Bahamas next weekend, and his first individual 100m race of the season will likely be over 100m at the Doha Diamond League meeting in Qatar on 15 May. \u201cI\u2019ll run a couple of 200m races here and there too,\u201d he added. Gatlin says he is looking forward to renewing rivalry with Bolt \u2013 who missed most of 2014 with injury \u2013 though a clash between the two is unlikely to happen before August\u2019s IAAF World Championships in Beijing. The Jamaican won his first 100m race of the season last week in Rio de Janeiro, running 10.12 seconds. \u201cMe and him are going to clash, and when it happens, it\u2019ll be big,\u201d said Gatlin. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cat-and-mouse game where I\u2019m chasing him to the end of his career. It\u2019s more about taking it step by step so if [Bolt] goes until 2017, I know he\u2019s going to come out and have a great couple of years before then. I\u2019ve prepared myself for a clash with Usain. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to be rivals for the next two to three years and we\u2019ll have a good time.\u201d Asked much longer he sees himself competing, Gatlin \u2013 who turned 33 in February \u2013 explained he\u2019s keeping his options open. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. When I hang those spikes up, I don\u2019t want to look back and think: \u2018I wish I did a couple more sit-ups or I wish I did more runs\u2019, and that really motivates me. That helps me rebuild myself every year. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the sport when the young dogs push the old dog out. Until then, I\u2019ll stick around for a little while and collect a couple more checks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
