The Taiwanese capital has 7,264 of them, and their distinctive orange frames, yellow fenders and smiley face logo are nearly as common in some parts of town as the city\u2019s ubiquitous motor scooters. Last year, the city\u2019s bike rental program logged more than 20m trips, a stunning figure that becomes slightly less surprising when one considers that the bikes rent for as little as $0.15 per half hour from 222 self-service, card-activated storage lots. It\u2019s hard to believe that, just four years ago, the program was on the edge of collapse, done in by a lack of rental docks and a scarcity of viable bike lanes in the city\u2019s choked streets. After a brief burst of enthusiasm, cycling became an unpopular method of transportation as citizens tried to save gas money during the global financial crisis. The city worked with Giant Manufacturing, the company that produces the bikes, to turn its bike rental program around. Giant upgraded its fleet to include mini locks, strong braking systems and bikes that change gears \u2013 a move that cut down on the number of repair jobs and broken bikes. For its part, the city added rental stations and bikes near metro stations and bus stops, areas where commuters who normally walk to work might be interested in a more convenient alternative. The city will continue this trend: by 2019, it plans to spend about $32m on more bikes and more places to rent them. It aims to open a total of 400 rental stations by 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient,\u201d says 35-year-old Taipei dance instructor Vivian Chen, a rental bike rider of three years. \u201cTake today,\u201d she continues, pulling out of a rental station in February. \u201cI\u2019d pay around 20 Taiwan dollars ($0.65) for the metro, but I think the bike rental costs less in the first half hour. And it would take me longer by metro because my destination isn\u2019t right on the train line. I would need to walk a ways to get there.\u201d Public relations and public transportation For Giant Manufacturing, which sells its bikes through 12,000 retailers in 50 countries, Taipei\u2019s rental program isn\u2019t a big money maker. It breaks even on the program, says Liu Li-chu, a spokesperson for Giant subsidiary YouBike. However, the program gives the company an opportunity to introduce potential customers to the benefits of cycling while building public good will toward its brand. Li-Chu, who is also the daughter of 82-year-old King Liu, Giant\u2019s founder and CEO, says that her father doesn\u2019t just make and sell bikes. \u201cHe rides and thinks other people should ride,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re putting good bikes in front of citizens and saying, \u2018Ride and see You\u2019ll fall in love. These bikes are addictive.\u2019\u201d For Taipei, building a loyal ridership was a challenge. One of the city\u2019s strategies was to offer the first half-hour free, a move that attracted masses of short-distance commuters in the cost-conscious city. Rentals doubled to 22m between 2013 and 2014, and city officials hope they would help to reduce air pollution and rush hour traffic congestion. \u201cThat initial thing about getting users in for free and getting them used to bikes \u2013 that was everything,\u201d said Anthony van Dyck, a Canadian expatriate in Taipei who follows YouBike as founder of an informational website for foreigners. \u201cThat and they never stopped adding bikes and adding stations.\u201d The next struggle is traffic management. Many drivers in Taipei do not observe the designated bike lanes. On some streets, bikes compete for right-lane space with scooters, bus stops and double-parked cars. Sidewalks can be packed with pedestrians and shopping arcades. \u201cWe\u2019re now making plans for education and promotion work,\u201d said Liu Chia-yu, a division chief under the city\u2019s transportation department. \u201cFor bike riders, we\u2019re saying not to compete with pedestrians, and for people on foot, if you run into a bike give it some space.\u201d A growing solution Public bike rental programs are a growing solution for cities. According to Jack Oortwijn, editor of Netherlands-based magazine Bike Europe, between 600 and 800 cities currently have them. They have already changed commuting and tourism for European cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where half the population gets to work by bike. Paris\u2019s bike program logged more than 200m rentals within seven years of its 2007 launch. Public bike programs are expanding across Asia, too. Japanese tourist mecca Kyoto has one, and Korean capital Seoul launched a system like Taipei\u2019s in late 2015. It plans to expand city-wide by 2020 with as many as 20,000 bikes. Meanwhile, numerous cities in China, including Beijing, also rent bikes to the public. Hangzhou, a city of 7 million people near Shanghai, leads Asia \u2013 if not the world \u2013 with more than 78,000 rental bikes. However, in many crowded cities \u2013 particularly in the developing world \u2013 bike programs are still an unaffordable luxury. Part of the problem also lies with the public image of bikes as a symbol of poverty, Oortwijn says. Research has shown that the image problem happens in industrialized or developing countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of priorities and awareness,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem with city councils is that they\u2019re not aware of the possibilities that bicycles can offer. In developing countries bicycles are regarded as the poor man\u2019s transport. That negative image is still there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
