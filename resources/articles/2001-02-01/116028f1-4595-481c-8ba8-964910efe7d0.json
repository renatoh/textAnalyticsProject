In its long-awaited interim response to Lord Phillip's critical BSE report published last year, it pledged ministers will be more open in handling health scares. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, outlined far-reaching measures to keep people better informed about future crises. \"There has been a significant loss of public confidence in the arrangements for handling food safety and standards, due in large part to the events surrounding BSE,\" said the response, which is due to be presented to parliament today. \"The government recognises that its efforts to build and sustain trust through openness cannot succeed unless it is fully prepared to acknowledge uncertainty in its assessments of risk.\" Lord Phillip's 16-volume report highlighted a desire to avoid an unjustified health scare, poor departmental communication and bureaucratic delays in responding to scientific warnings about BSE risks. Published last October, it criticised ministers and civil servants for failing to be open about the possibility of BSE spreading to humans. Today's 102-page response sets out plans to ensure lessons are learnt from the scandals and to rebuild faith in food safety. It said: \"The whole approach and behaviour of departments and individuals will need to change to ensure that the lessons identified by the inquiry are properly absorbed and implemented.\" It continued: \"A balance needs to be struck between intervening too much, forgoing benefits and stifling people's freedom of action, and failing to help protect them sufficiently from actual or potential hazards.\" But the government added that it had already taken steps to improve the situation, such as setting up the food standards agency in April 2000 and improving arrangements for other departments to communicate with the public. More than 80 people have died from vCJD, the human form of mad cow disease, and the government has agreed interim compensation for families. Today's response said BSE was \"a national tragedy\", adding that it has had \"damaging and far reaching effects.\" It focused on a number of key areas for improvement, including science and governments, and examines the way ministers obtain scientific advice and how it is used in taking policy decisions. The report also looks at openness and what the government is doing \"to generate greater public trust in its handling of food safety and related issues.\" The report added: \"The government does not believe there any serious gaps in its powers to take proportionate emergency action against hazards to human or animal health.\" But it added that, in general, the response recognises \"the need for government departments to change the way they operate, with the emphasis in securing positive changes in behaviour rather than policy, structure or machinery.\" The Consumers' Association said the EU must also learn the lessons from the Phillips inquiry. The consumer watchdog said there were still loopholes in current EU control measures that needed to be addressed. Related special report What's wrong with our food?
