Fear of debt was putting off potential applicants to university, the widely respected Whitehall troubleshooter told the Guardian. He said the maintenance grant was a \"flexible instrument\" which could be used to attract people from working-class backgrounds. His comments come amid mounting pressure on the government to review its financial arrangements for students. University vice-chancellors will this week call on the government to give more help to undergraduates. Lord Puttnam, the film producer turned educationalist who is close to Labour ministers, also fuelled calls for reform last night when he asked the government to consider introducing a graduate tax, scrapping fees and bringing back the grant. He said debt built up under the current system was deterring people from applying to Sunderland University, where he is chancellor. Tony Blair has ordered a Whitehall review after being harangued by students about debt during the election campaign and internal focus group work showed the issue to be Labour's single most unpopular policy. Mr Blair accepts that the policy may be hindering efforts to reach his 2010 target of 50% of under-30s experiencing higher education. One proposal being considered by ministers is expanding the \u00a340 a week educational maintenance allowances for poorer students, which are being piloted in sixth-forms and further education colleges, to the first year of higher education. Another option on the table is extending \"opportunity bursaries\" - \u00a32,000 available from this year to 25,000 inner-city students. An education department spokesman said: \"Like any sensible government, we con tinue to monitor our student support arrangements.\" But a senior Whitehall official said: \"There is a general willingness to look at reform throughout government.\" In 1997 the then education secretary, David Blunkett, rejected the key parts of Lord Dearing's report, which proposed bringing in tuition fees for all students and increasing student loans but retaining the grant. Mr Blunkett brought in tuition fees with exemptions for low-income students but ditched the grant, increasing the burdens on the poorest applicants. This year students whose parents earn more than \u00a329,784 have to pay \u00a31,075 in tuition fees; those whose par ents earn less than \u00a320,000 - about 50% of new entrants - pay nothing. New students are entitled to \u00a33,815 in virtually interest-free government loans. Lord Dearing said his committee rejected scrapping maintenance grants because \"the only people who would have lost out would be the students from the poorer homes\". \"If you have tuition fees across the board but reintroduce maintenance grants for the less well-off you have through the maintenance grants a sensitive instrument through which you could increase or taper the rate according to your experience of participation rates by the [working] classes,\" he says. \"Would it not be a good move to think again about maintenance grants as a flexible instrument you vary and think in terms of an [post-graduate] income contribution possibly starting at a higher level of income than at present?\" Sunderland has the best record of any university in England for attracting working-class students, according to analysis by the funding council. Lord Puttnam, chairman of the General Teaching Council for England, told the Guardian: \"The people who we want to attract and need to attract not only won't get into debt but the concept of debt is anathema to them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
