Here, penstemons that arrived in June show little sign of giving in to autumn fall. More predictably for the season, there are heleniums, canna and several varieties of crocosmia. Behind them, the creamy yellow stems of bamboo filter the afternoon sun. From June onwards, says Collier, she is constantly deadheading and cutting back, encouraging plants to revive themselves. Which partly explains why the garden continues to look so vital. But this late in the season, she's also relying on September staples - like her treasured daisy-flowered rudbeckia. Perennials like this, with their yearly ebb and flow, are a key feature of the garden. \"I love the fact that there is nothing here in winter,\" says Collier. \"That it goes bleak and then abundant.\" Anyway, who would want to be a shrub under Collier's withering eye? When she moved here six years ago, she spent 12 months pondering a view of bushes such as camellia, before deciding the lot would have to go. \"The shrubs were similar shapes with a similar colour,\" she remembers. \"They were all kinds of death. I didn't want a garden of bottle-green foliage; it comes over to the eye as a navy blue - very depressing.\" Colour is Collier's business. She is one half of the textile partnership Collier Campbell, which for more than 30 years has produced vivid prints for the likes of Yves Saint Laurent, Liberty and Habitat. She lives in Clapham, south London, with a narrow garden that is typical of urban Victorian semis. Step out of Collier's back door, on to a paved area dotted with pots, and two wide herbaceous borders lie before you, divided by a winding gravel path. Here are white echinacea, red sedums, yellow achillea and towering bronze and red eupatorium. It's a busy mix, like a festival crowd on a sunny day, but never gaudy. This, Collier reckons, is down to a calming blend of colour, the predominant yellow held in check by the occasional blue - agapanthus, Penstemon 'Sour Grapes', Salvia uliginosa ... There's no formula for putting it all together, though. Rather, it's intuitive: \"Don't forget the colours all belong to form and height. Whether the eye is going along, up or across. It's a huge harmony.\" At the back of this initial herbaceous area is a yellowish diagonal of plants across the width of the garden. There are three varieties of bamboo, variegated catalpa, and below this light green foliage plants such as Melianthus major and spurge. Gradually, though, your eye is drawn to the far end of the diagonal, where the giant Rudbeckia 'Herbstsonne' basks in the sun. \"I think what yellow does is to make it light, not heavy. To me it says sunlight: it's terribly inviting.\" However, adds Collier the textile designer, you wouldn't necessarily use it on a fabric. \"It makes such demands on the eye. Harmony is what you're after, not a headache,\" she says. \"But in the garden I think it's different - it's not repeating like a fabric. I wouldn't have it if I didn't have plants like the Salvia uliginosa to balance it.\" Past the bamboo is a gravel area where Lychnis chalcedonica and toad lilies appear from a dusty base. There's a border with more crocosmia peeking above foliage and, further on, a tiled table looks on to a water feature that Collier had built when she moved in. To one side is a Cornus capitata, a rare survivor of Collier's ruthless purge of shrubs. She enthuses about this specimen, with its white flowers in spring and its covering of strawberry-coloured autumn fruit that looks gorgeous enough to eat. She might have a designer's discipline, the rigour to chuck out shrubs that do not suit, but she's an awful sucker for colour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
