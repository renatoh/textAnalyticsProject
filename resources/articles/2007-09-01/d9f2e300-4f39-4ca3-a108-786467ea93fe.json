After a break I'll be raring to take on Murali and co", "bodyText": "It was nice to hear Peter Moores sing my praises after the win at Lord's, but the truth is I owe him a lot for the progress I've made recently. If there is one main difference between the dressing-room culture now and 12 months ago, it's that I've had some really honest chats with both Mooresy and Andy Flower about what I've needed to do to take my game to another level. Mooresy has consistently backed me and encouraged me to express myself, and the result is that I'm hitting the ball more fluently than I have ever done in my career. I'll be honest. I went into the NatWest Series against India realising that it was more than a big series for the team; I knew it was a huge series for me personally. I saw it as a potential turning-point in my career. Crunch time, if you like. I knew at the start of the series that people still had question marks over me at No3, and I owe a lot of thanks to Moores and Paul Collingwood for showing faith in me. I've taken my game to a new level. The thing I've been most pleased with from a technical point of view has been my batting against the spinners, and that's where Andy comes in. I've mentioned how practising in the nets with a thinner bat has helped me with my timing, but Andy and I have been working on manoeuvring the ball into gaps, working the singles and knowing my boundary options. He was a great player of spin himself, and I've become more aware as a batsman than ever before. It's not just a matter of sweeping, which is a shot we've sometimes played too early in the past. It will be an option in Sri Lanka, but in England there are so many other shots you can play: I've used my feet, played more shots wide of cover and hit a lot of twos. I've hardly swept at all. People have also mentioned my improved strike-rate, but the interesting thing is that it has not come about because of boundary-hitting. It comes from being able to rotate the strike better. Now I'm not facing two or three dot balls. I'm going four, then one, and getting off strike. I'm never going to be like Dimi Mascarenhas or KP, hitting the ball over the rope all the time, but I feel like I understand my brief better than ever before. I now feel I have got a role to play, and I've also done a lot of work on the maturity side of things and on my preparation. I've been trying to think, \"what would the world-class players like Ricky Ponting do in this situation?\" It's been a question of attitude, of mental toughness and assessing situations. But it's also been a question of taking pride in playing for your country, which is something Allan Donald is very big on. With the amount of cricket we play you can forget sometimes that you're playing for your country. It's important to avoid the treadmill mentality. Getting the hundred at the Rose Bowl was a big moment for me, but what's pleased me most has been the consistency. I also know I can get better. There were certain times, for example, in the game at Old Trafford when I got rattled. We weren't chasing many, and they came at us very aggressively. I went in a bit over-aggressive in my batting, so that told me I need to learn to stay cool in pressure situations. Did my omission from the Twenty20 World Cup motivate me more? I guess it did, although I haven't played any Twenty20 for Warwickshire in the past two seasons, so I think that was always going to count against me. But I'll be keeping an eye out on the boys from Spain, where I flew out on Monday for a week's break. England wanted me to take a breather rather than play for Warwickshire, so at least it's a chance to clear the mind. And it'll be my first week away for 16 months. After that, I'll be raring to go against Murali and co in Sri Lanka."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
