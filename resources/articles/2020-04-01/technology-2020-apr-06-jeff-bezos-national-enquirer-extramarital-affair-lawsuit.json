The claim raises new questions about how American Media Inc (AMI) discovered the Amazon CEO\u2019s relationship, and how it obtained knowledge of explicit sexual photographs that Bezos, one of the world\u2019s richest men, has alleged were used against him by the publisher for \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d. The claim by Bezos that he was being blackmailed by AMI is the subject of an FBI investigation. AMI has publicly insisted that it relied on only one source for its salacious scoop about the Bezos affair: Michael Sanchez, who is the brother of Lauren Sanchez, Bezos\u2019s girlfriend. Michael Sanchez was reportedly paid $200,000 by the tabloid for intimate texts and other information about the secret affair, which ultimately led to Bezos\u2019s multibillion-dollar divorce from his wife, MacKenzie Bezos. But in a new lawsuit filed in March against AMI, the Enquirer and top AMI executives, Michael Sanchez has accused the company of an elaborate plot to \u201cscapegoat\u201d him, and has cast doubt on the claim that he was the \u201csole source\u201d of all the information and materials the tabloid obtained before it published its stories about the extramarital relationship. Instead, Sanchez has claimed in court documents that the Enquirer publisher relied on multiple sources, including the use of \u201chigh-tech spyware\u201d to secretly hack Bezos\u2019s phone and extract \u201chis most private and confidential information\u201d. Sanchez\u2019s allegations echo claims that have been levelled against AMI by Bezos\u2019s own security team. In a Daily Beast op-ed last year, Gavin De Becker, Bezos\u2019s top security consultant, said he believed that Michael Sanchez had played a relatively minor role in the Enquirer\u2019s story, and compared him to a \u201clow-level Watergate burglar\u201d. \u201cReality is complicated, and can\u2019t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like \u2018the brother did it,\u2019 even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid,\u201d De Becker wrote. It is still far from clear how the supermarket tabloid landed its scoop, and how it obtained information about some \u201cbelow the belt\u201d photographs Bezos sent to Lauren Sanchez while their relationship was still secret. The Guardian reported in January that Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, had his mobile phone \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. The matter is under investigation by experts at the United Nations. Saudi Arabia has denied it hacked Bezos. In his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez admits having played a role in the Enquirer story, and claims to have done so \u201cstrategically\u201d to minimise fallout for his sister and control the \u201cnarrative\u201d of the story. While he has not denied supplying the tabloid with some of the couple\u2019s private texts , he has denied the allegation that he ever gave AMI sexually explicit photographs. Those photographs have never been published, but Bezos referred to them in an extraordinary blogpost statement on the matter in February 2019, a few weeks after the Enquirer story was published. Bezos claimed in the post that he was the victim of an extortion attempt by AMI. The billionaire executive also published emails from AMI executives which he claimed showed the company threatening to publish sexually explicit photographs \u2013 which it described in detail \u2013 if Bezos did not publicly state that he had \u201cno knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d. At the time Bezos said he had decided to publish the AMI emails \u201cdespite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten\u201d. In his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez described himself as his sister\u2019s \u201cprimary confidant and advisor\u201d when he learned about her relationships with Bezos in March 2018. He said he was introduced to Bezos a month later over dinner, and said he had immediately \u201chit it off\u201d with the billionaire. A preliminary investigation that was commissioned by the Amazon CEO found that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that an intrusion into Bezos\u2019s mobile phone was triggered after an infected video file was sent to him over WhatsApp from the account of the Saudi crown prince on 1 May 2018. In his lawsuit, Sanchez has alleged that he was first contacted by the Enquirer about his sister\u2019s affair with Bezos in July 2018, and has claimed \u201con information and belief\u201d that AMI was \u201calready in possession of raunchy text messages and nude selfies exchanged\u201d between Lauren Sanchez and Bezos. Sanchez also referred in his lawsuit to a cryptic email he said was sent by Dylan Howard, AMI\u2019s vice-president, dated 22 January 2019. A person close to the matter said it was a response to a previous email from Sanchez about the Bezos story, which had been published a few weeks earlier. \u201cThe untold story \u2013 if you will \u2013 has not been told as to how we uncovered the story. I\u2019m saving it for my tombstone,\u201d Howard wrote in the email, according to Sanchez\u2019s legal filing. In a statement, AMI denied Sanchez\u2019s allegations. \u201cThe fact, as we have maintained throughout, is that Mr Sanchez sold the National Enquirer the story about his sister\u2019s secret affair and was the sole source for its reporting. His frivolous lawsuit underscores what his true motivation is, his own greed,\u201d the company said. AMI did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Howard\u2019s email or what the executive was referring to. An attorney representing Bezos did not respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
