Moore won the prize for articles on attitudes to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the wake of the #MeToo movement; why she was wrong to refuse to wear a poppy for remembrance; and why she did not take part in the march for a People\u2019s Vote. The prize is awarded for commentary or reporting which comes closest to the writer George Orwell\u2019s ambition to \u201cmake political writing into an art\u201d. The judges were Tim Marshall, a former diplomatic editor at Sky, Sam Taylor, editor of the Lady magazine, and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club. Moore was awarded the journalism prize jointly with the deputy editor of Prospect magazine, Steve Bloomfield, at a ceremony at Jeffery Hall in central London on Tuesday. The judges said: \u201cThe journalism that has won these two prizes represents the best of the Orwell tradition, incisive, relevant and human. It also represents the two sides of his journalism: there is Suzanne Moore\u2019s stubborn and brave commentary, and Steve Bloomfield\u2019s forensic research and reporting.\u201d In their acceptance speeches both Moore and Bloomfield lamented the lack of diversity in the media. After the ceremony Moore said she planned to celebrate with the \u201cbiggest G and T you have ever seen\u201d. Last year\u2019s winner was the Observer\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr for her investigation of the collapsed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr gave a presentation at Tuesday night\u2019s ceremony on the legacy of Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published 70 years ago this month. The prize is awarded by the Orwell Foundation with the support of Orwell\u2019s family. Moore was presented with a folio edition of Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, signed by Richard Blair, George Orwell\u2019s son. She also picked up a cheque for \u00a33,000. Two books about the Troubles in Northern Ireland were announced as winners of the Orwell prize for political writing and political fiction. Anna Burns\u2019s experimental novel Milkman won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing was awarded to Patrick Radden Keefe for his book Say Nothing. The Orwell prize for exposing Britain\u2019s social evils went to Max Daly for his investigations for Vice linking missing children to county lines drug selling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
