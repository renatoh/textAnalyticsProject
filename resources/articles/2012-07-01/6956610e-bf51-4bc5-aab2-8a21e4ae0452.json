Goals from Everton's John Lundstram and Tottenham's Harry Kane before half-time were enough to take England into the top spot of Group B and earn a tie with Greece in Tallinn on Thursday. France, who finished second, will face the holders Spain in the other semi-final on the same day. The England Under-19 head coach, Noel Blake, praised his players for following his tactical plan against France, especially in the first half. \"We had a game plan on what to do without the ball and the players executed that to the letter,\" he said. \"With the ball, I was quite pleased at times and we created some good chances on the counterattack.\" Blake said his players would not be treating Greece lightly. \"They did very well in last year's finals in Romania and I think they have five or six boys from that squad here this time, so they are a strong side,\" he said. \"We know we are in for a tough game, probably harder than this match. We can't turn up and think that because it's Greece and not Spain or France, that it will be easier.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
