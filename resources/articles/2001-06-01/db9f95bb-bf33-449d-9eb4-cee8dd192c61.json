In a less overt way, the ethical fund industry has spent years trying to persuade savers that investing in a socially responsible way won't lose them money. But - unlike Millbank's success at the last election - converting this interest into business has been problematic. So do you have to sacrifice profits for principles? The nub of the \"ethics cost money\" argument is that ethical funds screen out companies considered to engage in harmful or environmentally damaging activities. Critics say this means reducing the number of stocks available for investment, and concentrating on smaller companies' stocks as larger conglomerates are more likely to have interest in \"unethical\" operations, simply because of size. Proving that ethical funds fare better or worse overall than comparable non-ethical funds is difficult. The real test of whether a green portfolio poisons profits is to compare ethical and non-ethical funds from the same management group. However, for the record, the average UK ethical fund fell by 7.4% over the year to 30 April 2001, compared with a fall of 5.7% for the average UK All Companies fund, according to the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds. But ethicals outperformed the mainstream sector in the three years to the same date, growing by 12% compared with 8.2%. Global growth funds show the opposite: the 12-month figures were down by 10.5%, compared with minus 1.2% for the all funds index. But over three years, the gain was only 10.5%, compared with 16.7% for mainstream global growth trusts. Some funds have achieved outstanding comparative performances. Jupiter Ecology, an ethical global growth fund, fell by only 2.3% in the year to 30 April, while the non-ethical Jupiter Global Opportunities fell by 26%. Most global ethical funds outperformed their mainstream counterparts from the same manager over that time period. But for the three years to 30 April the performances of the two Jupiter funds were almost identical. UK ethical funds did less well over the 12-month period, especially in relation to trackers. Norwich UK Ethical lost 6.5%, less than the company's UK Equity and UK Growth funds, but more than its UK Index Tracking fund, which lost only 2.3%. On recent figures, the performances of similar funds from the same manager cluster around the same level. This suggests that factors such as the manager's expertise and the house investment policy are as important as the ethical aspect. Jupiter says that it would generally expect a similar performance from its Ecology and Global Opportunities Funds because the managers work alongside each other so there is cross-fertilisation of ideas -stocks selected by one manager might be used by the other. \"Fund performance depends on how a manager controls its risk profile and asset allocation,\" says Lee Coates, director of IFA Ethical Investors Group. \"We aim to outperform the UK All Share or the World Index, and other than for short periods, virtually all the funds we've picked have done so.\" Mr Coates says that ethical funds tend to be less volatile because they're not following the herd, but not all advisers are convinced. \"We have used ethical funds as good quality funds,\" says Tim Johnson, managing director of London-based IFA BMS Financial Services. \"But many don't have a long-term performance history. And they're not getting the pay-off yet from the expense of the extra research. We have to warn our clients that a limited investment pool could produce more volatile returns, and 99% are not accepting ethical restrictions.\" Triple bottom line Ethical investors will be in a majority by 2006, according to a new report from ethical independent financial advisers Holden Meehan. The IFA puts this down to a combination of higher awareness, the growth in ethical funds to around 50, from just one in the mid-80s, and to more companies supporting the \"triple bottom line\" of environmental sustainability, sound financial performance and social responsibility as the route to long-term profitability. \"These policies are crucial in terms of reputation, risk avoidance and long term profits,\" Patrick Meehan says. \"Look what happened to companies such as Nike, Nestle and Shell which ran into negative ethical publicity. Compare that with companies active in 'ecotech' such as fuel cell and wind farm technology, where shares have been rising sharply.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
