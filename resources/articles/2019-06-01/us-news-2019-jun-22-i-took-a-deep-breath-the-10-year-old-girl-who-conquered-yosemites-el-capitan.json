Selah Schneiter, 10, scaled it before she entered fifth grade. Selah became the youngest person known to have achieved the feat on 12 June. Selah was no stranger to El Capitan: the site, her father said, was \u201cin her blood\u201d. Mike, a climbing guide, brought his daughter there when she was two months old \u2013 though she wasn\u2019t quite ready to make the ascent. El Capitan was the first place Mike and Selah\u2019s mother, Joy, climbed together. In the process, they fell in love \u2013 and years later, it was there that they decided to have kids, fantasizing about climbing the formation with their own children someday. \u201cI had no idea it would happen so fast,\u201d Mike said. Selah\u2019s achievement led to a flurry of media attention and TV appearances in New York. \u201cI live in a town with a population of about 9,000\u201d in Colorado, she told the Guardian. \u201cIt can be difficult to switch to the big city.\u201d The climb itself, however, was less intimidating. \u201cThe only thing I ever got scared of was what would happen if I didn\u2019t do this,\u201d Selah said. Her determination outweighed any fear. \u201cI took a deep breath and I thought: what does this mean to me? Am I gonna bail or am I not gonna bail? I\u2019m gonna make that decision.\u201d Selah, Mike, and his friend Mark Regier didn\u2019t rush their way to the top, Mike said. They spent five days on the ascent, taking long lunch breaks and starting late, by Mike\u2019s standards \u2013 a relaxed 6.30 or 7am. Selah made her way up the route \u2013 a particularly challenging pathway known as the Nose \u2013 primarily by jumaring, or climbing with assistance from a rope and other gear. (Only a handful of people have ever made the ascent via free climbing, in which the climber uses hands and feet while attached to a rope purely for protection.) At night, father and daughter slept on a portaledge, a tent-like device for multi-day climbs. Images from the ascent are head-spinning, but as a climbing guide, \u201cyou definitely have a mindset of being really in tune with the dangers and the risks that you\u2019re faced with,\u201d Mike said. \u201cOddly, we never felt really in danger at any point. We felt really comfortable up there.\u201d When they finally reached the top, they received a surprising text from Joy, Mike said. A friend at Outside Magazine, which reported the climb, had investigated the matter and identified Selah as the youngest to have scaled El Capitan. The family had been vaguely aware that she was among the youngest climbers, but beforehand, Mike had cautioned against focusing on setting any records. \u201cDon\u2019t even look it up,\u201d he told his companions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to be our motivation.\u201d With her success behind her, Selah has wise words for anyone facing a difficult climb of their own \u2013 real or metaphorical. \u201cIf you have a big goal, it\u2019s really hard to attack it all at once. You have to do it piece by piece. Take that big goal and make it into a bunch of small goals.\u201d And though the heights may be dizzying, remember: \u201cYou look up a lot more than you look down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
