Needing a win to tie the two-match series, the Sri Lankans began the final day on 180 for three in their second innings, 55 runs ahead. They made the worst possible start when Mahela Jayawardene was dismissed by the first ball of the day from Makhaya Ntini, although replays showed the lbw decision to be incorrect. That set the tone for what followed; Sri Lanka collapsed to 245 all out after being 179 for two on the fourth evening. However, the South Africans, chasing a nominal target of 121, were assailed by nerves and slumped to 73 for six. Dilhara Fernando did the damage with a spell of four for 33. Shaun Pollock's side were indebted to the contribution of Neil McKenzie, who came in at 44 for five and made 39. When he was bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan, South Africa had all but sealed the match and with it the series 2-0. Pakistan duly completed another 2-0 series whitewash after a comfortable 10-wicket defeat of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. The hosts resumed on 171 for five but could make only a further 110 runs against an attack that was missing Shoaib Akhtar, who was forced to rest a slight knee injury. Pakistan reached their target of 57 without loss. The ICC says it is ready to take matches away from problem venues in the wake of crowd violence which marred the first three one-day matches between India and West Indies. \"As a starting measure fines could be imposed and in the ultimate case the respective board could be told that a particular venue was not permitted to hold international matches,\" said the ICC's chief executive Malcolm Speed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
