Max Jones, the UK Athletics' performance director, has written to each of the 58 members of the team of 58 in a bid to boost their self-belief. \"We shall have, in Athens, the best prepared British Olympic team in history,\" Jones wrote. \"Lottery funding over the past seven years has enabled UK Athletics to put in place a world-class support structure of which, for example, our medical team is now on par with any in the world. \"We are now in a position to have a successful games if you have confidence in your own ability and are positive about achieving in Athens. Believe in your own talent, in your coach, in your support team and, finally, in yourself as an elite athlete.\" Colin Jackson and Steve Cram are among the former athletes who have criticised the team and Peter Matthews, the respected editor of the ATFS Annual, the sport's Wisden, has predicted Britain's lowest medal haul since 1976 in Montreal when the only medal was Brendan Foster's bronze in the 10,000 metres. Indeed Jones had also helped fuel the pessimistic mood by saying, three months ago, Britain had less medal possibilities than they did in Sydney, where the team won six, including two gold. \"All I did early season was point out that we had less probable medallists this time around - there were plenty of possibles but not too many probables, which was true - and some people took that to mean we weren't going to win anything at whatever,\" he said. \"It seemed that expectations went through the floor and I sent the letter to tell them to prove people wrong and get out there and do it. \"I was portrayed as saying we didn't have a good team and we'd have a poor games, but that was incorrect. The only thing I was saying was that we didn't have as many probable medallists as in Sydney.\" Jones, who is due to retire after the Games, is overseeing the last-minute preparations of the squad at the pre-Olympic training camp in Cyprus, where only three of the team due to compete in Athens are not scheduled to visit. They include Paula Radcliffe, the world-record holder for the marathon who has relocated from her normal training base in Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees to a secret location in southern Spain. \"I have spoken to Paula on the telephone and everything is fine,\" said Jones. \"She said everything is going very well and she has no injuries, so she is very happy at the moment. \"Paula has always done her own thing and we don't have a problem with that. In any case, Cyprus is probably not the best environment for 25-mile runs. \"She wanted to go where she has been before and which is proven, not take any risks. We have confidence in Paula and she has her own support team where she is, and she'll go to Athens on the 18th.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
