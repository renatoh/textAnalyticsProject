The pair have described the potential movie as a comedic take on Witness, the 1985 movie which saw Harrison Ford's cop as a fish-out-of-water in Amish country. The Rock is already lined up to play the Hawaiin King Kamehameha in another project in development. Thomas Vinterberg, one of the original Dogme directors, has obtained the rights to Maldonne, a 1962 novel by French authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Vinterberg's Nimbus Films optioned the story about a poor musician who is paid to pose as his wealthy double, but is really being set up as a decoy for a killer. Boileau and Narcejac may not be household names, but the pair's mystery books have been made into such films as Hitchcock's Vertigo, Franju's Eyes Without a Face and Clouzot's Les Diaboliques. The Contender director Rod Lurie is turning his hand to romantic comedy with Beat the Eagle. The story concerns a retired US president whose campaign to become mayor of the small town to which he has moved becomes a fierce battle against a local businessman. Lurie told Variety, \"It's so funny, commercial and high-quality that I was surprised they offered it to me\". The script was written by Tom Schulman, the author of Dead Poet's Sociey and What About Bob?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
