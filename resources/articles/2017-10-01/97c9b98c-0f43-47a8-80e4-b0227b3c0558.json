His statement the previous month showed that he was \u00a3306 in credit. British Gas explained that the sum related to an earlier bill which, because of an error, had never been sent. Hernon asked to see the bill and when British Gas failed to oblige, he turned to the Energy Ombudsman. It ruled that the bill should be sent. That was in April 2016. Hernon has still not received proof of what he owes and is unable to transfer his account until the sum is paid. Yet the ombudsman has closed the case and refused to communicate further. \u201cThe information provided by the ombudsman states that, once a review is accepted by the customer, its terms become binding on the company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has failed to implement its own policy and British Gas continues to hold my account hostage on the highest possible tariff.\u201d Hernon\u2019s frustration is echoed by Sarah Fowler of York, who complained to the Energy Ombudsman when she found that Extra Energy had confused her metric meter with an imperial one and tripled her bills. The ombudsman ruled Extra Energy should refund the \u00a32,300 she had overpaid and, when the money hadn\u2019t arrived three months later, it closed her case. \u201cThey explained that they must remain independent and unbiased and have no authority over Extra Energy,\u201d she says. The refund was only paid when the Observer contacted Extra Energy which explained that the delay was due to human error. Ombudsman schemes investigate and resolve complaints against a company or a public body when deadlock is reached, and their decisions are supposed to be binding. However, over the years, numerous readers have contacted the Observer claiming it has allowed firms to ignore its own rulings. \u201cConsumer feedback has been very poor,\u201d says Martin Lewis, founder of the campaign website Moneysavingexpert which is presenting a review on ombudsman schemes in parliament this week. \u201cOne of the biggest problems is that remedies are not being implemented, mainly because most ombudsman services lack the powers to enforce them.\u201d The \u201combudsman\u201d title is a loose term covering three tiers of dispute resolution. Statutory schemes \u2013such as the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Legal Ombudsman \u2013 have compulsory jurisdiction over certain regulated sectors, and decisions can be enforced by a court. Those, like the Energy Ombudsman, are underpinned by statute. Its compulsory for companies within that sector to be members of a scheme but it doesn\u2019t actually give them any more legal powers. If a company ignores their remedies, all they can do is suggest the customer takes court action or, in serious breaches, report it to the relevant regulator. Then there are voluntary schemes, established by a trade association, which are essentially unregulated arbitration with no legal powers, and companies can choose whether or not to cooperate. Lewis, whose review was commissioned by an all-party parliamentary group, says the system is a shambles. \u201cOmbudsman schemes should be the premier league of alternative dispute resolution, and it\u2019s time to crack down on the use of the term. Consumers need to have confidence that any body bearing the \u2018ombudsman\u2019 brand will investigate impartially, and companies will have to abide by their decision.\u201d He wants all ombudsman to be created or underpinned by statute and given greater powers to enforce their rulings. In Hernon and Fowler\u2019s cases the Energy Ombudsman \u2013 part of the private, not-for-profit company Ombudsman Services Ltd \u2013 ignored the powers that it already has. It tells he Observer that remedies must be implemented within 28 days unless the company requests extra time with good reason and, failing that, that it would support the customer in civil action. It fails to comment on why Fowler was let down. Hernon, meanwhile, was told in a letter from the deputy chief executive, Simon Morris, that it \u201ccan only take at face value\u201d a company\u2019s assurance that it has complied and that it did not discuss the non-compliance with British Gas. In a single day Hernon received two letters from the ombudsman, one declaring that British Gas had still not completed its remedies and that it would report it to the regulator Ofgem and open a new case into its failings. The other stated that British Gas had fully complied with its obligations and the case was now closed. Nearly a year on, it admitted it had never contacted the regulator and told Hernon that he had to open a new case. Ombudsman Services says only 509 of its 38,000 decisions in the 12 months to July 2017 remained unfulfilled after 28 days, but it admits that, in Hernon\u2019s case \u201cit is clear there have been some shortfalls and we have committed to undertake a review of the handling of the case\u201d. British Gas says the disputed bill had been cancelled and could not be regenerated, but that it supplied figures showing gas usage to the ombudsman, and considers it has fulfilled its requirements. At least the energy sector has an ombudsman which last year secured customer payouts totalling \u00a33.3m. In 2015 the government missed an opportunity when it enacted the EU Directive on Consumer ADR. It stipulated that all EU consumers should have access to an ADR scheme if they have an unresolved complaint about goods or services. In fact, UK legislation only requires companies to flag up a relevant scheme, not to cooperate with one. There was no move to expand and consolidate the powers of official ombudsman services, or even to ensure that they exist for different sectors. The Ombudsman Association, which represents ombudsman and complaint-handling bodies, says that the new legislation has encouraged competition which confuses consumers, and allows member companies to withdraw funding from one scheme and sign up to a cheaper, potentially less impartial rival. There are now 147 such schemes in operation, many overlapping and with 63% without official approval. \u201cThe Association\u2019s long-standing position is that there should be a single ombudsman within each sector, and one competent authority to set standards,\u201d says its director, Donal Galligan. \u201cThe establishment of more than one within an industry, creates risks creating uneven standards of investigation and redress. There can also be a risk of a race to the bottom.\u201d Martin Lewis believes that, ultimately, there should be a single compulsory ombudsman overseeing multiple sectors so that consumers can call one number and be put through to the relevant branch. He is also calling for an end to the rule which forces consumers to wait eight weeks before they can refer an unresolved complaint to an ombudsman. \u201cIf you are in debt and have a dispute with a payday lender, that two-month wait could cripple you,\u201d he says. \u201cIt dates back to snail mail and now, with digital communications, it makes no sense.\u201d MAIN WAYS TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE Alternative dispute resolution refers to ways consumers can seek independent redress from a trader if they feel they are in breach of contract. Although they are funded by the industry they represent, they are expected to have an independent board of non-executive directors with only a minority from the member companies. Schemes use a range of processes to resolve disputes and distinctions between them are blurred. The main types of ADR process are: \u25a0 Mediation A confidential process where an independent third party helps disputing parties reach an agreement. \u25a0 Conciliation Similar to mediation, but the independent third party has a more active role in suggesting what agreement should be reached. \u25a0 Arbitration An independent third party evaluates a dispute and decides how it should be resolved. The decision is binding on both parties. \u25a0 Adjudication Similar to arbitration, but the decision is only binding on the business, not the consumer, who can still take their case to a civil court. \u25a0 Ombudsman schemes Independent third parties who consider complaints and usually combine investigation, mediation, and adjudication. \u25a0 Court Formal legal action is usually the last resort employed by consumers to obtain redress. Consumers can, however, take legal action without going through the above routes if they wish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
