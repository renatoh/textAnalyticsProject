The New York band are clearly very much out of sorts. Merritt's anti-applause dictum stems from a chronic inner-ear condition that renders him hypersensitive to loud noises, but tonight he is more concerned with castigating the airline company that lost his luggage on \"today's eight-hour flight from Dublin\". It's not hard to glean that he would rather be anywhere else than here. It is a pity, because the Magnetic Fields' music is as winning as their onstage manner is profoundly off-putting. Merritt is the author of a seemingly endless stream of perfectly formed, beautifully yearning songs of failing relationships, which he relates in a rich baritone equally evocative of Neil Hannon and Bing Crosby. The band's most recent album, Distortion, was deliberately (and pointlessly) swathed in Jesus and Mary Chain-style feedback, but Merritt's hyperacusis prevents that being reproduced tonight. Instead, he renders Old Fools' meditation on flawed humanity with fitting tenderness, while the bitterly mordant Too Drunk to Dream is a laugh-out-loud funny exercise in magniloquent chamber-pop. Sadly, these successes don't make Merritt any happier. \"This is another song about being abandoned,\" he drawls, and when the audience titter sycophantically, he mocks their reaction with a hollow laugh of his own. It has been a compelling show, and yet we are somehow relieved when it is over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
