Her 64th goal, a tap in from Rachel Hill\u2019s 70th-minute cross, took Kerr clear of Michelle Heyman\u2019s previous benchmark, before she added a second on the night \u2013 a well-taken header \u2013 and 65th of a stellar domestic career. Kerr, still just 25, also broke Heyman\u2019s record for most goals scored by any player for a single W-League club (51), having re-signed for her hometown club Perth in 2014 after a two-year spell with Sydney FC. Her latest double took her to 52 in a Glory shirt. She is leading this season\u2019s golden boot race with one game of the W-League\u2019s regular season to play, and is likely to have more than that one game to add to her tally \u2013 Perth\u2019s 5-1 win over Wanderers took them top of the table, ahead of Melbourne Victory on goal difference, but having played two more games. \u201cAny time you break a record it\u2019s a huge achievement and it\u2019s something I\u2019m proud of,\u201d Kerr told the W-League after the game at Marconi Stadium. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that coming into the game. It\u2019s obviously a proud moment and something I\u2019ll look back on for the rest of my career.\u201d Remarkably, she could have reached her milestone earlier in the game, after she missed a penalty and a one-on-one chance in the first half. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doubting myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a little frustrating. That\u2019s why I celebrated like I did because goals don\u2019t come round that often and when they do it\u2019s such a great thing. I\u2019m lucky I have teammates to pick me up because today was a tough one.\u201d Kerr also holds the all-time record for goals scored in the NWSL, the United States\u2019 premier women\u2019s competition, with 55."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
