Spieth struggled on the greens throughout a second round of 73 at the Shell Houston Open, and the 22-year-old did little to mask his frustration. At four under par in total Spieth requires something extraordinary over the closing 36 holes if he is to head for Augusta National with the boost of a Texan victory. \u201cI was really looking to gain some momentum today and kind of halted it instead,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI have got to putt better. I\u2019m losing a couple of strokes back to the field on putting and normally we\u2019re gaining strokes. Inside 10 feet I have got to be solid and confident. \u201cI can\u2019t get into a rhythm. I\u2019m stepping off putts. That\u2019s a tough feeling and it kind of bleeds into the rest of your game, too, because you feel like you\u2019ve got to be more aggressive. \u201cSo it really comes down to the putter for me. I have to get better before next week. I have got to get more comfortable, find a set-up position that I feel is going to produce the correct start lines.\u201d Spieth further bemoaned \u201cdumb stuff\u201d such as two balls hit into water on par-fives on Friday, which triggered bogeys. \u201cI\u2019m going to be squeaking by the cut line and really far back from the lead,\u201d he said. \u201cSo unfortunately it\u2019s going to take something really special over the next 27 holes to even have a chance on the back nine on Sunday. I obviously would have liked to have more of a chance. \u201cBut it is what it is. I can only improve from here. There\u2019s really nowhere to go but up on this weekend. I just need to find a higher comfort level with my putter and hopefully that leads to some mid-range putts going in plus some under-par rounds.\u201d The Masters champion was at least spared the ignominy of a post-round penalty, after video analysis of an incident on the 5th green. Spieth clearly did not make a stroke at the ball when six inches from the hole but the matter was reassessed by rules officials. Spieth\u2019s compatriot Rickie Fowler was in considerably more upbeat mood after a second round of 70 left him one better than Spieth with 36 holes to play. Fowler has endured a curiously low-key 2016 so far. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d said Fowler. \u201cI haven\u2019t had my best the last few days but I felt good out there. I have a couple of things to make some tweaks to and work on this weekend but definitely I like where my game is at going into next week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
