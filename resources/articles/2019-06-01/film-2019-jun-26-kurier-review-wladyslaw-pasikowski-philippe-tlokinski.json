Philippe T\u0142oki\u0144ski stars as Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski, emissary of the Polish government in exile in London struggling to make his way back across Europe to a Warsaw resistance caught between a Nazi rock and a Soviet hard place. The film has a taste for defiant proclamations \u2013 \u201cGiving up for the first time in our history will surely break the spirit of this nation!\u201d \u2013 that you imagine will put a spring in the step of the new breed of Polish EU-shin-kickers. Having said that, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Pasikowski \u2013 a crowdpleasing film-maker with a string of domestic hits \u2013 relays Poland\u2019s darkest hour with enough nuance and peril to stop Kurier from being outright jingoism. His fluid direction ensures Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski\u2019s infiltration \u2013 via a parachute drop from Brindisi, with a couple of SS-dodging set pieces en route \u2013 never shirks taut genre requirements. But the realpolitik hoops he must jump through en route are equally arresting. Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski\u2019s journey, in order not to jeopardise British-Soviet relations, has to remain so clandestine that the resistance leader, B\u00f3r-Komorowski, initially refuses to see him. Once he is through the door, he has to persuade the rebels to disobey their historical instincts and buddy up with a Soviet war machine already sizing the country up. Perhaps Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski is such a prominent war hero in Poland that Pasikowski didn\u2019t think it was necessary to spend much time on his inner character. Beyond a certain klutziness \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know how to ride a bicycle when told to escape on one \u2013 there isn\u2019t much to break T\u0142oki\u0144ski\u2019s indomitable facade, or any clue as to which powers his dogged drive. Kurier, though, has a confident, committed sweep; enough to suggest that Pasikowski could capably expand his canvas to war stories outside the Polish purview."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
