This documentary sees the historian unpick conflicting accounts of the scandalous sex trial in 1877 that followed the publication of Fruits of Philosophy, a practical guide to sex by Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh, social reformers who wanted to transform a world full of straitjacketed thinking. Half an hour is barely adequate to deal with this subject, but it\u2019s a start. Mike Bradley Summer of Rockets 9pm, BBC Two \u201cI\u2019m not a spy, I don\u2019t know how to do this,\u201d pleads Samuel Petrukhin, as MI5 demands he provides a list of attendees of the Shaws\u2019 latest drinks party. Stephen Poliakoff\u2019s glossy drama steams into rough waters this week as Kathleen continues her secret search and Petrukhin promotes his \u201cportable bellboy\u201d. MB The Virtues 9pm, Channel 4 Stephen Graham and Niamh Algar are astonishing right to the wrenching end of Shane Meadows\u2019s drama, which in its closing episode breaks down to the question of whether its characters will make an awful decision under the severest strain. You\u2019ll be thinking about the final scenes for weeks to come. Jack Seale The Blacklist 9pm, Sky One The enjoyably daft procedural \u2013 about slippery master thief \u201cRed\u201d Reddington (James Spader) and his FBI agent daughter Liz (Megan Boone) crossing off a blacklist of bad guys \u2013 reaches season six. Spicing things up is Highlander\u2019s Christopher Lambert as an assassin: there can be only fun. Graeme Virtue Private Eyes 9pm, 5USA Jason Priestley, of Beverly Hills 90210 fame, stars as Matt Shade, ice-hockey player turned private investigator, paired with Cindy Sampson\u2019s feisty boss. This opening episode sees them look into the case of a promising protege of Shade nobbled by persons unknown. Slick fun with the C5 guarantee of \u201cquality\u201d. David Stubbs Mum 10pm, BBC Two Stefan Golaszewski\u2019s subtle sitcom brims with home truths in an episode characterised by unspoken flirtation and tender yearning. Tired after a \u201cfun-packed\u201d day in Canterbury, Cathy steals away for a secret cigarette, tempting a forlorn Michael: \u201cWe should run off into the woods together, just the two of us.\u201d Well written. MB Film choice Clockwise (Christopher Morahan, 1986) 6.30pm, Talking Pictures John Cleese\u2019s irascible headteacher is flattened by time\u2019s winged chariot in Christopher Morahan\u2019s slight, but achingly funny, comedy, scripted by Michael Frayn. Heading for a conference in Norwich, Brian boards the wrong train and is soon deep in a travel nightmare horribly familiar to rail users everywhere.
