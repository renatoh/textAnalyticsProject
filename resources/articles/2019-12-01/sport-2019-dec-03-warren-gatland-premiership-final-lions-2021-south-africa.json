The Lions head coach, Warren Gatland, would like his squad to enjoy time together before flying out but is still waiting for the Premiership clubs to agree to moving their final forward by a week. The South African itinerary is set to involve three Tests in Soweto, Cape Town and Johannesburg and five provincial matches \u2013 four against Super Rugby sides plus a midweek game versus an emerging Springboks selection. As things stand it will be the briefest of tours \u2013 the past three tours all involved 10 fixtures \u2013 making life extra difficult for Gatland as he seeks to mould a Test team capable of beating the world champions. To allow more preparation time the Pro14 has agreed to shift the date of its final but the Premiership has yet to follow suit. Its final is still due to be played on 26 June, just seven days before the Lions\u2019 first tour fixture. \u201cThey have said they are not moving their final which I find very disappointing,\u201d Gatland said last month. \u201cIf PRL did that it would be fantastic ... it would help us so much in the planning and preparation. I cannot understand why PRL would not want to be more positive about doing more to help the Lions and embrace it. Whether they are playing hard-ball or not it would be nice to give the Lions the best possible chance to go there and win the series. Hopefully common sense will prevail.\u201d Northampton, meanwhile, have told England to keep their hands off the Saints\u2019 highly rated attack coach Sam Vesty following the decision of Eddie Jones\u2019s assistant Scott Wisemantel to return to Australia. Vesty is among the brighter up-and-coming English coaches but the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, says the club are not keen to see him poached by the Rugby Football Union. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be releasing him, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Boyd, who was instrumental in hiring Vesty from Worcester. \u201cI suppose everybody\u2019s got their price if it\u2019s about money [but] Sam Vesty\u2019s more about job than money I think. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s happy with what he\u2019s doing at the moment.\u201d Northampton are in flying form and sit top of the Premiership but will be without their international second\u2011row Courtney Lawes for the European pool game against Leinster at Franklin\u2019s Gardens on Saturday. Lawes aggravated a hamstring problem in training before the big home win against Leicester and is rated only 50-50 for the second leg of the Leinster double header in Dublin next week. The former All Black prop Owen Franks also has a broken thumb that will keep him out of action until after Christmas but the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar is hopeful of being fit for this weekend having been forced to pull out on the eve of the Tigers game with a toe problem. \u201cI\u2019m not going to use the word grumbly again because that\u2019s how we described [the now-retired] Dylan Hartley\u2019s knee but he\u2019d got a niggly foot,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cHe probably could have played last Saturday but he couldn\u2019t kick. He didn\u2019t train today but there\u2019s no reason why he won\u2019t play on Saturday.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
