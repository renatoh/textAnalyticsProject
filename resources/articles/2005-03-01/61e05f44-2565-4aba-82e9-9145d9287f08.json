In Athens, the squad won four medals, including two golds, but its core was provided by many of the same cyclists who had made their breakthroughs with the lottery-funded programme in Sydney four years earlier. Most were in their late 20s or early 30s. In LA, the balance was redressed when the British team blooded four debutants aged between 18 and 20. \"They are here on merit, to win medals,\" said the performance director, Dave Brailsford, and the point was underlined yesterday when the 19-year-old Mark Cavendish won gold in the madison relay together with the 32-year-old Rob Hayles. \"For a kid to get a madison gold at that age is unheard of,\" said Brailsford's predecessor as performance director, Peter Keen, who founded the lottery-funded programme. Indeed, senior golds at that age are few and far between. The team's plan was to blend Hayles's experience with Cavendish's raw speed, and it paid off as the pair gained a vital lap on the field 30 laps from the finish of the 200-lap event, which ensured their gold medal. Another world championship novice to break through was 18-year-old Nikki Harris, who finished seventh in the women's scratch, and that came the day after another debutant, Ed Clancy, helped the team pursuiters to a rapid qualifying time on Saturday morning. While Harris has emerged through mountain biking, both Clancy and Cavendish were discovered by the talent identification system which Keen put in place after Sydney. \"No one had heard of Ed. He has a thumping big engine and he put himself forward,\" said Keen. \"They are the first breakthroughs from talent ID, and I don't think anyone was expecting it just yet.\" Once spotted, Cavendish and Clancy were both honed by a newly formed elite academy - founded 12 months ago - which is intended to bridge the gap between junior racing and the Olympic Podium programme for seniors. \"The idea was to get youngsters into what was a kind of boot camp, to be honest,\"said Brailsford. \"We've been very tough on them, we lost two of the original six, but the others suddenly flourished midway through the year.\" The academy riders were based in two houses in Manchester, given equipment which was a level below that of the senior cyclists, and had to make their own way to certain races. They went through intensive track training sessions - \"it took them from average riders to advanced in terms of skill,\" said Brailsford. In addition, they received an education programme that included learning French - cycling's lingua franca - cooking and workshops on nutrition. \"They had to learn to look after themselves and their health and how to cohabit,\" said Brailsford. \"The first six months were all about lifestyle, living the life of a professional athlete. They had to be very dis ciplined. They were given training programmes. Someone turned up at five past nine for a session at nine am, they would not train. If their bikes weren't clean, they would have to clean them.\" Cavendish gave one example of the approach earlier this season: \"We had a team plan at one of the races last year (under-23 series) and we rode like wallies.\" The following morning their coach Rod Ellingworth had the academicians training hard in the rain for between four and five hours. \"It wasn't enjoyable but it did make you think you don't want to do it again.\" \"For the first time we've got some youngsters making some of the older riders look over their shoulders,\" said Brailsford. \"We came here with unfinished business from the Olympics and put the record straight, now the Commonwealth Games is the next objective. We want to go to the Australians' back yard and win medals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
