I was living in a private rented property when the owner sold it. I had a new baby and a toddler. On benefit, it is hard to find landlords to take you on. I went to so many estate agents and they all said they didn't take DSS clients. I had to go to the council housing office for help and they put me in bed and breakfast accommodation. We were all in one room - to sleep, cook and eat - and with no cot for the baby. I didn't feel safe there - I could smell the man in the next room burning his drugs most of the night. In June 2003 we moved to a temporary flat. They tell you that you could be there for a couple of weeks or a couple of years. I could get a letter saying I had to be gone within a week or so. It stopped us settling in. We ended up staying for three years, but I was always waiting for that letter. It was nice to have our own bathroom again and some space, but the cooker never worked properly and the door was hanging off the fridge. My son is asthmatic and because of the damp he got pneumonia twice. In January 2006 I finally got the eviction letter. I saw an advert for Shelter and I phoned. They told me I was entitled to the deposit for a two-bedroom property through my council's rent deposit scheme, to help me back into private renting. When I found this out I was pretty annoyed. I'd been on the homeless list for three years but the council hadn't informed me of this. I could have avoided the B&amp;B; my daughter wouldn't have had to go through changes of school. I had also felt tremendously guilty. It made me feel worthless. I'd wanted to give my kids a stable upbringing, be a role model for them as my parents had been for me. When I viewed this property through the scheme, I started feeling better. Dagenham's nice. The kids think this is home now we've got all our stuff here. My son's health has improved. My daughter will be able to bring friends back. We've got the essentials, now it's the little bits that make a home that I'm picking up when I can. Silly little things like mirrors and a laundry basket. If I'm honest, it's still in the back of my mind that my landlady might want to sell this place. Becoming homeless was a frighteningly easy situation to fall into. You lose all control of your surroundings. But I feel much more positive. This is the kids' home, and my home. A year from now we should be 120% sorted and settled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
