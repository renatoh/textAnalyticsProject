Gilligan, the BBC Radio 4 defence correspondent whose Today programme report on the September dossier caused the stand-off between the corporation and the government, has always maintained he ran his story by the MoD the day before it was broadcast on May 29. But Kate Wilson today told the Hutton inquiry Gilligan merely mentioned in passing he was running a story on weapons of mass destruction during a call to discuss an entirely separate story about cluster bombs. According to the MoD press officer, Gilligan did not even tell her he was putting together the report until she asked whether he had any other stories on the following day's programme. \"I am very clear that when I spoke to Andrew Gilligan the conversation was about clusterbombs,\" said Ms Wilson, who was being cross examined by Gilligan's counsel, Heather Rogers. \"I do not see how that can be classified as checking the story with the Ministry of Defence. He used the words 'weapons of mass destruction' and 'dodgy dossier', he mentioned it in passing, but that was not what the conversation was all about,\" she added. Ms Wilson said she had not quizzed Gilligan further on the story because he \"specifically said it was not a matter for the MoD\". She also said Chris Howard, producer of the Today programme, had called the press office the night before to discuss a planned interview with the armed forced minister, Adam Ingram. Howard had, she said, warned the press office the programme would \"add two minutes on WMD at the end of the interview\" - but had not made any further reference to Gilligan's planned report. Gilligan has maintained all along he checked his story - which claimed a senior intelligence source had accused the government of \"sexing up\" its dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction - with Ms Wilson before running it on the Today programme. Ms Rogers told the inquiry today: \"Mr Gilligan's recollection is that he rings you...about his own story and that he outlines that he has a source who says the dossier is exaggerated.\" It also emerged today Gilligan had called the MoD press office over a month later, on June 28, to discuss the conversation he claims he had with Ms Wilson. According to the MoD's records he told the press officer on duty at the time he wanted to \"record the fact that I spoke to Kate\". Ms Wilson, who was at home at the time, said the press officer on duty had not known what Gilligan was referring to. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
