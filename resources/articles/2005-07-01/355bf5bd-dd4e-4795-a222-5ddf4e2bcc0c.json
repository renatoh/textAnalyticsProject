We think it's scandalous that we've had our budgets capped for an increase that is in effect just 14p per week or \u00a37.20 a year out of a total average band D council tax bill of \u00a31,177 per year. Rebilling our residents for this small change at a cost in excess of \u00a3100,000 is in my view a total waste of their money. For several years we've been setting our budgets strictly in line with government rules, have claimed funding due to us and managed to absorb the cost of implementing new statutory duties without additional funding streams. Yet now we find that central government is effectively dictating future local service cuts and removing our local right to set our own council tax; we believe this is an affront to local democracy. Central government ignored our arguments as to the method we used to set our budget and council tax increase for 2005-06. Our method accounts for, in particular, government rules for the phased withdrawal of housing subsidy grant funding (which supported social housing), a long-standing government arrangement that allows local authorities to raise additional funds via planned (and allowed) council tax increases of \u00a310 a year. In Daventry's case these arrangements allowed us to phase in such increases over an eight-year period between 2001 to 2009 to compensate for the phased withdrawal of the negative housing subsidy worth \u00a32.1m to district council tax payers in 2000-01. For 2005-06, our total local band D council tax increase was \u00a313.12 per annum (13.6%) of which \u00a310 (10.4%) was in accordance with the government's own arrangements regarding the negative housing subsidy, leaving a balance of the increase of \u00a33.12 (3.2%) set in line with the retail price index (RPI) to cover inflation. The council took a unanimous decision for this increase following a risk assessment process, which clearly indicated that substantial service cuts would be inevitable over the next few years if increases were lower than that set. By cutting our budgets the government, in what is clearly a cynical political manoeuvre, is changing the rules mid game. The previous year they did not \"cap\" councils whose bills were below the national average - however this year without notice they changed the criteria. So by \"chance\" those small Conservative led councils with small council tax levels, well below the national average, found themselves in the firing line! The government relies upon the fact that the public at large do not understand the vagaries of local government funding and how central government itself is the main factor behind large or small increases of individual councils' tax levels. In effect, our income stream will reduce by \u00a3889,000 between April 2005 and March 2009 due to the withdrawal of the residual negative housing subsidy. Our efficiency targets set under the Gershon review of public efficiency will now have to plug the funding gap rather than be used to improve services. Daventry district council is recognised nationally for its consistently outstanding waste recycling performance, our fast and positive reaction to delivering the county and office of the deputy prime minister growth agendas, our top quartile council tax collection performance and our implementation of an effective financial strategy that has addressed previous district auditor concerns. We agree with Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, the Local Government Association (LGA) chairman, who was quoted as saying following the government's decision to cap eight small councils: \"This is centralised stupidity. The government has ignored common sense and ridden roughshod over the wishes of local people, literally for a few paltry pence a week.\" Tony Blair's government is now forcing us to potentially make substantial service cuts, which I believe is totally unacceptable to the residents of Daventry. The time has come to say enough is enough. If the government is serious about devolving powers and responsibilities to local communities as part of its localism agenda, then they need to stop playing \"silly politics\" such has happened in this instance which in turn does the image of either themselves or local government no good at all. \u00b7 Chris Millar is the leader of Daventry district council"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
