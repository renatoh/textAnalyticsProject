The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, reveals that the proportion of people who have prediabetes \u2013 higher than normal blood glucose levels but not yet high enough to cause diabetes \u2013 has tripled in eight years. The levels have risen from 11.6% in 2003 to 35.3% in 2011, the latest figures available. These people are at high risk of developing the disease, which can cause serious disability and early death. The study was carried out by the University of Florida, in collaboration with the University of Leicester. Lead author Arch Mainous, professor of community health and family medicine in Florida, said: \"The rise is substantial. There is no other way to describe it. Something must be done to address this or there will be a substantial rise in the prevalence of diabetes in the UK.\" Up to one in 10 people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within a year. Over five years, 15%-30% will become diabetic unless their behaviour changes. This is the first study to look at the prediabetes rate in England, even though type 2 diabetes rates have been going up steadily. Studies in the US have shown prediabetes running at 36.2% in 2010, while in China, with a prediabetes prevalence of 50.1%, half the adult population is now at risk. The data comes from four years of the Health Survey for England \u2013 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2011 \u2013 and included more than 20,000 people, who had given blood samples. In 2011, 5.59% of the population had actual type 2 diabetes. But the numbers with prediabetes were more than six times as high. All groups in the population were affected but, say the authors, \"minority ethnic groups are particularly affected, as are the socioeconomically deprived\". People with prediabetes were likely to be older and overweight or obese, with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Half the respondents in the Health Survey for England 2011 who were overweight \u2013 with a BMI more than 25 \u2013 and aged at least 40 had prediabetes. The numbers were as high among women as men. The authors say their study shows there has been \"an extremely rapid rise\" in the numbers of people at risk of diabetes. \"This rapid rise in such a short period of time is particularly disturbing because it suggests that large changes on a population level can occur in a relatively short period of time,\" they write. \"These findings are particularly problematic given the strong association of prediabetes with overweight and obesity, given recent remarks by CMO (chief medical officer) Sally Davies that overweight and obese has become the new normal for England.\" Mainous said that better detection was one possible strategy. \"People are not likely to change their behaviour when they are at risk of disease unless they know that they are at risk. We know that diet and lifestyle changes are effective interventions for prediabetes and can even get folks back to normal glycemic levels,\" he said. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said those at high risk must be made aware of it, so they could get help to change their lifestyle. Not all those eligible were getting an NHS health check, and advice on their weight, diet and exercise . \"Unless we make people aware of their risk of type 2 diabetes and support them in changing their lifestyles, we could see an even greater increase in the number of people with the condition than we are already expecting. A tenth of the NHS budget is already being spent on diabetes and unless we get much better at preventing type 2 diabetes this spending will soon rise to unsustainable levels,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
