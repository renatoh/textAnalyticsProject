He spoke animatedly in Arabic and looked across at me in the driver's seat several times. I was pretty sure I knew who was on the other end of the phone. Jalal tried to hand it to me. \"He wants to speak to you.\" I shook my head. My mind was racing. After 43 years of silence, I couldn't indulge in two minutes of small talk on someone else's mobile. Jalal tried again. \"He really does want to speak to you.\" This time something willed me to pull over. I might never have the chance to speak to him again. He could return to Baghdad and get blown to pieces in a market suicide bombing. And with that graphic image embedded in my mind, I had my first conversation with my father. Up to that point, all I knew of him was that he had been a carefree, hard-drinking student in late-1950s Britain, with a penchant for sharp suits and a generous monthly allowance from his middle-class merchant family back in Basra. To my mother, he had seemed exotic and glamorous compared with the office workers and greasy teddy boys of post-war Birmingham. They quickly became an item and a year later, despite my grandparents' displeasure, got married in a church in Erdington, Birmingham. Twelve months later they had my sister and, on a family visit to Basra in 1963, I was born. By now, their marriage had hit some predictable challenges. Life in Basra was not easy for western women: it wasn't just the searing summer heat and basic facilities, but also the lack of personal freedom that my mother took for granted in England, not to mention an unfolding military coup. My mother had to be chaperoned everywhere while my father resumed his busy bachelor lifestyle. After a year-long stay, my mother, my sister and I returned to England with assurances that my father would follow. Back in Birmingham, with no home and no income, we had no option but to live with my grandparents in their council house in Kingstanding, a socially and economically deprived area of the city. A series of letters were exchanged across the continents over the next five years between my mother and father, who churned out excuse after excuse for not coming to the UK. As the letters petered out so my mother discovered, perhaps not surprisingly, that he had remarried in Iraq. We, meanwhile, lived in a tightly knit white working-class community. Although waves of immigrants from Asia and the Caribbean were arriving in Birmingham, none of them were settling in Kingstanding. From time to time my origins were the focus of attention, but my peers always had problems working them out. At secondary school I was inexplicably nicknamed Paki for a while, before that was superseded by Spick, Dago and Eyetie. Despite this, I never felt I was anything other than British. My nan would cook us stodgy roast dinners most days, with fish and chips on Fridays and salad on Sunday evenings. My sister and I grew up on a diet of BBC and ITV sitcoms and spent summer holidays at Pontin's holiday camps. By the end of the 70s I was pogoing to the Sex Pistols and the Clash; I'd dyed my hair auburn and joined a punk band called the Androids. Throughout my 20s, most people assumed I was Italian, and I willingly played along with it. With its warlords and religious zealots, Iraq was an embarrassment to me. Although I felt a degree of anger and resentment towards my father, I never consciously missed having a dad. For many years I had little contact with my other Iraqi relatives, aside from my uncle Kim and cousin Jalal, who were living in the Netherlands. It was when Jalal came to visit me in Torquay, where I had lived with my wife and two young sons for four years, that my father finally made contact. Sitting in the car, on Jalal's phone, I was waiting for my father to break down and sob uncontrollably, or at least say sorry. But he was very calm and composed, and instead of promising to visit, simply asked me to write to him. It was the first of many disappointments. After that conversation, I sent him an email. It didn't pull any punches. I wrote that I had virtually given him up for dead, and I was still mystified as to why he had failed to keep in contact with his children - no birthday cards, phone calls, messages, nothing. But I added that I was willing to offer him an olive branch. On Christmas Day 2006 I received his reply. Sadly his predilection for excuses was very much intact. He blamed everyone from the Israelis for declaring war on the Arab nations in 1967 and so curtailing any foreign travel, to Saddam Hussein for confiscating his house in Basra in 1992 after the first Gulf war. Still no mention of the \"s\" word, and to rub salt in the wounds, he signed off \"your dad\". \"He may be my father but he will never be my dad!\" I raged. The emails continued, however, and with my mother's reluctant blessing, I decided it was time I met my father in the flesh. By this time my father and his family, all Shia muslims, had fled to Damascus in Syria as refugees, having been forced out of their home in a mainly Sunni area of Baghdad during the height of the sectarian tensions after the American invasion. Boarding the plane, I felt torn. I was intent on asking my father some difficult questions, but my conscience was nagging me that this was a man who had paid a heavy price for turning his back on us and remaining in Iraq to endure three terrible wars and now an appalling civil war. Again, my expectations of a tearful reunion followed by an outpouring of remorse from my father were shattered when he greeted me with a beaming smile and a fag in his hand. Perhaps the horror of living through three wars had anaesthetised his emotions. He gave me a hug and mumbled something bland such as \"we meet at last\". The first thing that struck me was how short he was - a good three or four inches shorter than me - and that half of his teeth were missing. At 69 he cut a rather frail figure. \"Whatever did my mother see in him?\" I thought, perhaps a little harshly. My father and I walked to his flat to meet the rest of the clan, including his second wife. Once the niceties were over I approached him for a meeting, but my attempts were frequently stifled by his family entourage, who refused to leave his side. When I finally got the audience with my father I so craved, true to form the excuses rained down again. \"The situation I was in and the pressure I was under was enormous,\" he explained. \"I couldn't do anything.\" \"But children don't understand all that,\" I countered. \"They just want to see their father.\" \"But you are more free,\" he continued, looking agitated. \"If you have a family like mine, a large tribe, they all want to impose their opinion on you. I am the eldest son so it was very difficult for me to do what I wanted to do. Father, mother and brothers come first for us. And we experienced a lot of difficulties in Iraq over the years. Wars, we had to move house and I was without work for a while.\" \"But these are excuses and children do not do excuses!\" I roared. The conversation continued along these lines, and it was clear we were not going to make much progress. But we eventually found common ground in the realms of politics and literature, food and sport. We even shared a few laughs - especially when he downed and then spat out vodka he mistakenly took for water in my hotel room (he now embraces Islam). I came away from Damascus without any real answers, but we parted on good terms and continue to correspond by email. In the year since we met, he and his family have returned to Iraq. It is clear he loves his country, and that might be one key to explaining why he was unable to come back to England. For my part, I feel I have finally laid an old ghost to rest. And I have gained insight into some of his choices. I'd have loved a father to kick a football around with me or take me to see Aston Villa, but on reflection, I doubt if I would have swapped the Birmingham Bull Ring, Spaghetti Junction and Cadbury World for a life of war, national service and military dictatorship in Iraq. My father made some mistakes in his life, but paradoxically they ensured that I could live in a country that, far from being perfect, was essentially peaceful, stable and democratic. Something he will probably never see in his lifetime. \u00b7 Do you have a story to tell about your life? Email it (no attachments, please) to my.story@theguardian.com.
