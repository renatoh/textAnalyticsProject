While gays can more easily come out at work, for example, very few women will talk about the problems they encounter in their late forties as the menopause approaches. Most women experience some degree of physical, mental or emotional disturbance in the 'perimenopause' - the time leading up to the real menopause , in which their periods stop completely and their bodies go through consequent adjustments. Jenni Murray, presenter of Radio 4's Woman's Hour, describes her own experience in her book, Is It Me, Or Is It Hot In Here? 'This was the hardest part of my own menopausal symptoms,' she says. 'At the age of 46, with no prior warning and no history of depressive illness, I woke up one morning looking into a black tunnel with no light at the end. 'For several months, every awakening was a sock in the stomach and every programme a huge effort of will. The garden ceased to give me pleasure. I couldn't concentrate to read a book. The family avoided me and the poisonous black cloud that hung around me.' In researching her book (\u00a312.99 Vermilion), which is subtitled A Modern Woman's Guide to the Menopause, Murray contacted just about every well known post-menopausal woman she could think of in the UK. But most were so anxious about the reactions they could face that they would not talk on the record. 'There's a genuine fear that people would think they could not cope with their jobs if they had those symptoms,' she says. But some did speak out. Teresa Gorman, the newly retired Conservative MP and champion of the cause of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), recalled the memory losses she suffered, her tiredness, problems with her joints and her hot flushes. Others discussed their lack of interest in sex and such incidents as going to the lavatory before an important meeting to avoid the possibility of 'flooding', the sudden heavy loss of blood which can force a woman to rush to the toilets to contain the flow if she is caught unawares. Not every woman going through the perimenopause will be affected by all or any of these symptoms, but the majority are thought to have some form of difficulty. Up to 35 per cent, according to Murray, are thought to find the symptoms so bad that they seek medical help. Very little research has been done on how women cope with these problems at work. The Equal Opportunities Commission, for instance, has never taken a case which hinged on these issues. The Industrial Society, a great promoter of healthy and happy workplaces, has done no research in this area, has not mentioned the issue in its good practice publications and knows of no other specific research in this field. 'This is a problem that many women will suffer from,' says Samantha Hardy, the society's spokeswoman. 'I can't imagine that organisations are dealing well with it. Derogatory remarks would probably be made about a woman who openly talked about these problems.' But the silence in the workplace turns into a clamour in the doctor's surgery or the menopause clinic. Dr Margaret Upsdell, deputy director of the British Menopause Society, says: 'Having been a perimenopausal woman and a GP, I talk to many women about this. It is becoming more important as women get into positions of responsibility. There is nothing worse than having a hot flush when you are trying to argue your corner in a meeting. You end up looking as though you are flustered when you are not. It is a great demoraliser.' Other common symptoms include poor sleep and tiredness, loss of concentration, 'forgetting your words' and mood swings that can be difficult to control. The response to perimenopausal women can be very negative in terms of assessing their overall performance, says Upsdell. 'The attitude can be that they are just not coping, poor dears, and perhaps it's their age. And women don't always appreciate what is happening, either. On a business level, they can find it very difficult to appear to be in control.' Murray is infuriated at suggestions that some perimenopausal women might not be be able to work as well as usual. 'I will not have you say that,' she responds. 'Women work extra hard to be their best at work. It tends to be their home life that is affected.' But 57-year-old journalist Elizabeth disagrees: 'Of course it intervenes. Some people get away without it having any effect, but for me, there were the hot flushes, the insomnia, the depression and feelings of worthlessness. And it's another thing to worry about.' For most women, the menopause will last between one and four years, typically between the ages of 47 and 51. The taboos surrounding our lack of discussion about it go back to those days when giving birth to children was seen as the main purpose of every woman. But there are positive ways of dealing with it (see below). Maybe, just maybe, when more people have the courage to discuss it, the menopause will become just another part of working life. Don't pause for your menopause \u0095 Read up about the perimenopause before the symptoms descend on you. 'Women should make sure they are informed early,' says Dr Margaret Upsdell of the British Menopause Society. \u0095 Consider a variety of remedies. Many women - including the BBC's Jenni Murray - have opted for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and found it made considerable improvements in their symptoms in a matter of days. \u0095 Try acupuncture. It worked for journalist Elizabeth, who is now 57. A session with her acupuncturist routinely and almost instantaneously lifted the black depressions she sometimes suffered. Other alternative therapies, including herbal remedies, will work for some women. And there are numerous examples of people, notably Baroness Thatcher, who reached the heights of their careers at just the time when they were presumably menopausal. \u0095 Take extra care with other aspects of your health, and you will be able to cope much better. It's vital to get plenty of sleep, to eat well, to take plenty of exercise and to stop smoking, advises Upsdell. \u0095 Think about discussing your problems with a female colleague. There may be a woman in the personnel department you could speak to if your line manager is a man and you cannot face a conversation with him. You should put your side of what is happening to you on the record, especially if you are taking days off and could be facing disciplinary proceedings for poor attendance, lateness or poor performance. \u0095 Try to maintain a positive attitude. Many women have probably missed out on promotion because of their perimenopausal symptoms. If you know that your problems are temporary, you may be more motivated to believe in yourself and fight for that better post and pay rise. \u0095 Recognise that there could be legal remedies if you think you are losing out at work because of your condition. Solicitor Alison Clarke, author of Women's Rights at Work ( published by Stylus), says she has never heard of any legal cases in this area, but believes that claims could be made on the basis of sex discrimination, or under the Disability Discrimination Act. Clarke believes that the hand of women in this position will be strengthened 'when people are prepared to come out of the woodwork'. \u0095 Encourage your employer to think laterally, suggests Clarke. 'They need to recognise that women suffer from certain conditions which men don't suffer. Rather than thinking the worse of their women employees, employers should approach the subject sympathetically.' \u0095 Try to get yourself a good employer. 'There's a growing interest in the whole area of wellbeing at work,' says Sam Hardy of the Industrial Society. Flexible working arrangements will be particularly useful, she suggests, during the perimenopause."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
