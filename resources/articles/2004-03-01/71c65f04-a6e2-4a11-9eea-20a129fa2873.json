It must have been absolutely horrific, and he's had a tough enough time as it is with his injuries - he hasn't really played a stretch of tournament play for a couple of years - so for him to be able to put this behind him, it must be just such a relief for him and his family. \"One can only imagine what it's been like when this is your livelihood - and it's been his life for such a long time - to have this cloud hanging over his head.\" Although that cloud may have been lifted from Rusedski, a potentially blacker, more noxious pall still shrouds tennis. The ATP's admission that 16 more players have shown elevated levels of nandrolone from tests taken during this year alone suggests that the men's tour faces a crisis. Even the usually circumspect Henman, who will serve on an ATP committee to investigate the source of nandrolone - assuming it comes from a contaminated substance - admitted that these are worrying times for tennis. \"I think we have a great testing programme in position, but it's just worrying that there are these other issues and no one can really understand why,\" he said. \"I'm sure it's a very difficult position for the tour. We've got to try and get to the bottom of it somehow to find out what is going on because it's too important an issue and too big an issue not to get it sorted out. \"Correct me if I'm wrong, but these people who have had raised levels were all contacted and they really tried to investigate because you'd have thought there would be one common thing that everyone is taking which could be tested. But by all accounts no one knows what the story is, and that's really disconcerting. \"You'd have thought with the profile of this case that everyone would be so petrified of this situation, and they are. I mean as an athlete you just don't know what to think. I'm just so glad that I've given up trying to take any kind of bars or sports drinks, because the risks are far greater than the reward.\" The good news for Henman is that Rusedski is now free to play again, and should be available for Davis Cup duty in Luxembourg in April. \"Things are looking up,\" said Henman. \"We still would have fancied our chances, but throw Greg back into the equation and it puts a whole different outlook on it. It will be definitely a different feeling for Greg after last time.\" Henman was referring to Rusedski's collapse in the fifth rubber against Morocco's Hicham Arazi in Casablanca having learned of his positive test two days earlier. \"To be playing with that type of load on your mind must have been unbearable,\" said Henman. \"Hopefully he'll be a lot more relaxed for the next one.\" Rusedski innocent but the ATP guilty of incompetence Davis Cup will be comeback target Stephen Bierley: Probably the most inept governing body in the world"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
