His debut album is a set of 11 originals for acoustic piano trio, a form in which it is hard to do anything radically new. McCormack stays mostly within the conventions of mainstream contemporary jazz, while rethinking some of its rhythmic tropes. Jade Fox rhythm team Tom Skinner (drums) and Tom Herbert (double bass) show their mastery of grooves that also swing on tunes such as the Monk-ish Skin-Wah, the intense hustling title track, Herbert's cheerful Better Than People and the speedy Code Food. McCormack has a light dancing touch to his right-hand improvisations, exemplified by his solo over Skinner's rocking mallets on Juliette. He shows great potential for harmonic and compositional innovation on Happy Hour and the solo Open Letter, dedicated to his late father."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
