'We are just trying to find beautiful people!' she shouted. The scout from the New Faces division of Storm model agency was on the prowl at the V Festival yesterday. The agency had 12 people searching the Chelmsford site for who could become The Face of 2006. 'What about that one?' said the security guard, his eyes following a woman with long blond hair. 'She looks good to me.' But the agency that signed Kate Moss and Lily Cole was after a look different to that of the conventionally pretty 'girl next door'. 'We want people who stand out in the crowd,' said Saacha Scott, Storm's head of New Faces. There were certain must-haves: height, youth, slender build, strong features, symmetrical face, nice eyes, good teeth and smooth skin. Quirkiness also helped; the girls and boys who caught Scott and Bestford's eye nearly all had unusual faces. The pair spotted Caroline Brupbacher, a lofty brunette with bright blue eyes whose faded jeans hung loosely on her narrow hips, 6ft tall and 16 years old. They asked to take a photograph and Brupbacher happily obliged. The teenager, from Hornchurch in Essex, who has just finished her GCSEs said: 'I like fashion and people tell me I could do it because I am tall and thin.' If it doesn't work out she will carry on with her plan to study psychology. The scouts were pleased with Brupbacher's photographs and Scott said she was one of the girls they would call in for a test shoot. Scott noticed a woman with bright red hair. When asked how popular this feature was following the success of Lily Cole, a striking redhead, she replied: 'You can't keep pulling out the same thing.' Scott eliminated most people who fell below her own high eyeline. Only the most striking would be taken at 5ft 7in, none below that. Age is also a big consideration. At one point Scott spotted a woman in a green top and moved towards her for a better look. 'A bit too old,' she said, turning back. It was the same for two more women who appeared to be in their twenties. Scott said 16 was a good age, as the girls had finished their GCSEs and could take time out without hindering their education. The team targeted the crowds watching certain bands. Oasis, Jet and Maroon 5 were all picked out as fertile ground for potential recruits. Brupbacher and 14-year-old Samantha Allen had come to see Oasis, Lauren Kirby, 18 had come to see the Kaiser Chiefs, the Doves and the Bravery. Richard Bazley, 14, was stopped on his way to see Goldie Lookin' Chain. The attractive teenager, with olive skin and green eyes, didn't mind missing his favourite band if it meant he could become a model. 'Just think of the girls,' he said with a sheepish smile. Pictures of the 'scouted' teenagers will be posted on http://bites.virginmobile.com/ where the public will be asked to vote for their favourite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
