As a long-term strategist, Brown has had little practice at reacting quickly. Well, the terrorist attempts in London and Glasgow gave him an instant test. With his beefed-up security team, now including a retired admiral and the former head of the Met, Brown easily passed - no amateur dramatics, no histrionics, nothing silly. He may be a days-old prime minister, but he didn't sound like one. With his sober assessment of the danger and warnings of the inconvenience we will have to face, he made it clear that knee-jerk responses to atrocities will be a thing of the past. That's about as much as the current terrorist crises tell us about the new government. The really interesting signs have so far come from behind the scenes, and in particular the way the first two cabinet meetings have played out. Those attending who had experience of the Blair cabinet style are still recovering from the shock. In the Blair years, what happened was that everyone would trip in, listen to the report on forthcoming business, and then sit back while a pre-selected minister explained his or her latest moves on health, or transport, or what have you. There would then be a round of congratulatory harrumphing and everyone would trip out again. At Friday's cabinet meeting, by contrast, there was already a real debate. Jack Straw brought his plans for constitutional reform to the table. Two ministers, who had chatted before the meeting, were dubious about parts of this and, after checking with Brown, raised their concerns. A vigorous debate followed, with everyone contributing. Straw argued back, accepted some points, repelled others, and went off to modify his plans. There were no tantrums, no leaking and, it seems, no hard feelings. But despite the fact that the plans are scheduled for announcement today (the terrorist incidents may cause delay), they are being refined because of a collective discussion. You may think this boring, humble common sense. The truth is that, after the past decade, it's a small earthquake. Other early signs suggest the same seriousness about running things better. As leader of the Commons, Harriet Harman wants to brief MPs about the government's business rather than the lobby journalists. Brown was punctilious in his BBC interview yesterday not to give details of the constitutional changes ahead, because he wants parliament to find out first. Jacqui Smith has been put in at the Home Office precisely because she has a more consensual approach to dealing with problems than her tub-thumping, aggressive predecessor, John Reid. It may be bad news for journalists and broadcasters looking for a scoop or a fight, but it's good news for parliament and politics. And though all these good intentions may fray and decay as the pressure builds up on the new lot, so far Brown and his team are delivering what they promised. This may simply be high-minded piety, but it is also ruthless, bruising party politics. Not only did Brown insist that all the former Tory advisers, Liberal Democrats and others invited into his big croft must take the Labour whip, his plans for destabilising the other parties are moving ahead. The offers to Paddy Ashdown and Shirley Williams, and the roles for Julia Neuberger and Anthony Lester, may not have been the final deadly daggers in Menzies Campbell's back (there were too many worried Lib Dems already), but it looks as if a plot to oust him is gathering force. If it produces a new leader, such as Nick Clegg, who will give the Conservatives a tougher time in their marginals, Brown will be delighted. The Tories themselves are reeling. Yes, they may well get their balance back, and David Cameron is tougher than he looks. But there are several reasons to suggest Labour's poll bounce may be more than a blip. First, Brown's determination to rebuild trust and restore faith in the Commons robs the Tories of one of their easiest lines of attack - it's all spin. Just now, it doesn't feel like spin. Second, by bringing in former Conservative supporters, such as Digby Jones from business or Lord Stevens, who had advised Cameron on security matters, Brown shows how deeply he can reach into Tory England. Friends of Iain Duncan Smith, working on social justice for Cameron, say he too makes warm private noises about Brown's seriousness. And after the Quentin Davies coup, I'm told there are more Tory defections expected. In other words, as Cameron struggles to drag his party towards the centre, \"Tories for Brown\" are peeling off round the back. And third, the rather grimmer times play to Brown's strengths, not Cameron's. Brown may be accused of being too serious, but his calmness, his traditional view of the importance of parliament and his brooding authority, fit nervous times better than the blithe optimism and labrador-puppy skittishness of the Tory leader. Asked yesterday about whether he was thinking of calling an early general election, our new prime minister reacted with the prim disapproval of a Victorian dowager presented with a sex toy. That was inevitable, given the backdrop - of course he had to say he was thinking only about the security threat - but the truth is that Brown's decision to lay the ground for an early election, likelier next year than this, seems sensible. The Tories have delayed their policy commissions so long that the new Labour agenda will be well understood by people before they get their messages across. On the form of his first five days, Brown is going to be far from an easy target. Plenty, always, can go wrong. The housing market is surely on the edge of a fall, the government is heavily borrowed, the demands on spending are rising again, and genuinely tough choices (for instance about the green belt and housing) will create clusters of new hostility to a party that has already been in power a long time. Brown himself will say something, or do something, that causes howls of outrage. Prime ministers always do. He is cautious, and may lose his nerve about election timing. But so far, he has moved fast, agilely and ruthlessly. He doesn't look like a tail-end charlie - and if I was in Conservative central office, sitting on my sacks of cash from City supporters, I'd be very worried indeed. jackie.ashley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
