Platini, currently suspended from his role as the Uefa president after his 90-day ban by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee while they investigate the 2011 payment, told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cI am, in all humility, the most able to run world football \u2026 even if I cannot go out campaigning, I fully consider myself a candidate.\u201d Of his suspension and the payment for consultancy work the Frenchman had provided to Fifa in 2002, he added: \u201cWas there work provided? Yes. Is an oral contract legal in Switzerland? Yes. Did I have the right to reclaim my money even nine years later? Yes. Did I produce a proper invoice as Fifa required? Yes. Was the money declared to the taxman? Yes. \u201cFifa had the right, after five years, not to pay me. But they decided to respect what was a perfectly valid arrangement.\u201d Platini, 60, did not stand in the 2011 election against Sepp Blatter, but would have been the clear favourite of the seven candidates to replace the disgraced president in the forthcoming election. And then the scandal broke over the payment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d said Platini. \u201cYes, I have waited a long time to reclaim what I was owed. But the only mistake is that I let several years go by. I had faith in the word of the Fifa president and I knew he would pay me one day. I was lucky enough not to need the money, but just because I don\u2019t need the money doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t be paid for my work.\u201d The election to find a successor to Blatter as Fifa president will take place on 26 February 2016, with Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa of Bahrain, the South African Tokyo Sexwale and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan now among the leading candidates after Platini\u2019s fall from grace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
