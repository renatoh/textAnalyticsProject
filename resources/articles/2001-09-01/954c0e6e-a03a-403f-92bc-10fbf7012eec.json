The mass-circulation newspaper Blick reported that a financial services company based in the southern Swiss city of Lugano, Al Taqwa Management Organisation, had links with the number one suspect in the attack on the US, Bin Laden. It quoted Switzerland's top policeman, Urs von Daeniken, as saying that the bank had been under suspicion for several years but authorities had never managed to find proof against it. Hansjorg Mark Wiedmer, from the federal prosecutor's office, refused to confirm or deny the report. \"Swiss investigations are going in all directions,\" he said. Authorities said on Sunday there was evidence that one of the hijackers had spent time in Switzerland and used a credit card to buy two knives. Switzerland froze accounts containing a few hundred thousand Swiss francs linked to Afghanistan's ruling Taliban earlier this year, as part of UN sanctions to pressure it into handing over Bin Laden. But the Swiss defence minister, Samuel Schmid, said on Friday there was no evidence so far of terrorists trying to hide behind Swiss banking secrecy to deposit their funds. Blick said that French intelligence experts told the Swiss three years ago that Bin Laden's funds from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were being channelled by Al Taqwa. It said one of the members of the board was Ahmed Huber, a 74-year-old former Swiss journalist converted to Islam, who claimed to have met Bin Laden's associates at a conference in Beirut and described them as \"very discreet, well educated and highly intelligent people.\" Mr Huber denied the company had anything to do with terrorist activities and said it merely funded developing aid projects in agriculture and education. Blick said the company president was Mohammed Mansour, an Egyptian-born professor at Zurich's federal institute of technology."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
