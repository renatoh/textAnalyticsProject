Far from being a mad dash around the flat two-mile course, though, this year's race threatens to be an exhausting challenge, and one that the trainer may yet decide to duck. \"Marble Arch is an intended runner, and if ground gets so bad that I don't want to run, then they probably shouldn't be racing,\" Morrison said. \"But if you've got a nice horse, you want him to run on the right ground. He's won on heavy, and it will probably be his last chance for a while to have a go at a race of this value with this sort of chance. But I don't want to take the bottom out of him by running at Newbury. Any punter who's got their head screwed on will see the forecast.\" Marble Arch has been the favourite for Saturday's race for the better part of a month, though he has not seen a racecourse since winning the Ladbroke Hurdle at Ascot in December. Valuable successes for Adamant Approach and Got One Too, who finished fourth and fifth at Ascot, have reinforced the value of the form, while Marble Arch has also made progress in ante-post betting on the Champion Hurdle. He was a 33-1 chance for the race at the turn of the year, but this morning you will not beat 16-1. Martin Pipe's Valiramix, who is currently the second favourite for the Champion Hurdle behind Istabraq, heads the weights for Saturday's race with 12st, and is expected to take his chance, which would leave 13 of the yesterday's 20 five-day entries running from out of the handicap proper. Pipe, too, might consider scratching Valiramix if the ground is too testing, but he also has Copeland in the race with just 10st 1lb, and as Morrison points out, \"the handicapper says that Marble Arch is well in, but I would suspect that it will suit Copeland as much as anything if Valiramix runs.\" Nicky Henderson, who has won the race three times in the last four years, still has four possible runners on Saturday, with Got One Too (6-1) and Tysou (11-1) the most prominent in the sponsor's betting. Three of the entries - Adamant Approach, The Gatherer and Joe Cullen - are trained in Ireland, although Adamant Approach is more likely to run in Sunday's Deloitte &amp; Touche Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown. The feature race there is the Hennessy Gold Cup, for which there were eight entries yesterday, including Florida Pearl, the winner of the race for the last three years. The Irish bookie Cashmans rates him a 7-4 favourite to make it four, and then bet: 100-30 Behrajan, 4-1 Alexander Banquet and Rince Ri, 11-2 Sackville and 18-1 Lyreen Wonder. The two remaining entries, Looks Like Trouble, the Gold Cup favourite, and Commanche Court, are both doubtful. \"We didn't enter Looks Like Trouble in the Aon [Chase at Newbury] because the weather was so bad this morning,\" Noel Chance, his trainer, said yesterday, \"and Leopardstown are experiencing the same weather, so we're going to go straight to the Gold Cup. He worked very nicely on Saturday.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
