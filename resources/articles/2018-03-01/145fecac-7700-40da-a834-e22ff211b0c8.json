Twickenham is about to witness one, with Ireland chasing only the third grand slam in their history and a cornered England side desperately seeking redemption. The St Patrick\u2019s Day expectation levels are starting to make the Cheltenham Festival resemble a village fete. The outcome, in theory, rests on Ireland\u2019s capacity to get up the hill, driven on by their hard-nosed forwards and their classy pilots at No 9 and No 10. Everyone knows what a polished team they are becoming; Saturday is the day to show they can also handle the dual pressures of favouritism and intense national fervour. That ambition will inevitably be shaped by the strength of England\u2019s desire to avoid a possible fifth-place finish in this year\u2019s table. Either way, it is likely to be emotional. A defining, if chilly, afternoon certainly looms for the coaches, Joe Schmidt and Eddie Jones, neither of them strangers to the winner\u2019s enclosure. The former has guided Ireland to three championship titles in five years but it is the mythical slam, hitherto claimed only in 1948 and 2009, that will seal his legacy. Jones, having seen England\u2019s momentum stalled by two grisly away defeats, needs his players to start doing his talking for him again. If he had stuck an \u201cr\u201d in his supposedly light-hearted reference to the \u201cscummy\u201d Irish he would have been fine; Schmidt\u2019s side love a set piece and the element of control that comes with it. As it is, Jones has risked tweaking the tail of the sabre-toothed Celtic tiger. In 2009, when Warren Gatland suggested every team in the Six Nations was particularly keen to beat Ireland, his words unquestionably motivated the then-Irish coach Declan Kidney and some of his players. \u201cDeccie was always very reserved about showing his emotions but on this day he really let go,\u201d recalled Rory Best, the seasoned Ireland captain, in Tom English\u2019s splendid book No Borders. \u201cThe players fed off that. I was surprised at Gatland because when you start throwing stuff like that out there it generally comes back to bite you. It gives fuel to the other team. It\u2019s the type of game where bitterness is often a useful tool.\u201d On that basis Jones could have done worse than quote another former Ireland coach Eddie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s verdict on England this week \u2013 \u201ctheir back row is a mess, their midfield is worse, their defence is ropey and their confidence has been rattled\u201d \u2013 in his eve-of-battle address. Edinburgh and Paris have undoubtedly exposed some concerns in key areas but despite everything, there remains a very decent England side in there somewhere. A glance at this season\u2019s results also reveals a narrower gap between the sides than may be idly assumed. Ireland, like England, saw their game in Paris determined only in the final moments. England, like Ireland, thrashed Italy in Rome and established enough of a lead to see off the resourceful Welsh. Only when Scotland are involved do the stats diverge \u2013 although, even then, the Scots tossed away numerous chances to transform the contest. The challenge for the fit-again Dylan Hartley and his reshaped XV, then, is to jettison all the recent baggage and remember that, under Jones, no side have yet beaten them at Twickenham. Their half-backs have helped steer their club to consecutive European titles, the inclusion of Ben Te\u2019o at No 12 and Kyle Sinckler in the front row should bolster their ball-carrying and George Kruis\u2019s lineout expertise could be useful. That said, the most important Saracens player of all \u2013 Billy Vunipola \u2013 is still absent and it may have been better to utilise Exeter\u2019s influential Don Armand from the start. It would also help if England can summon up the unbridled ferocity they inevitably encounter from other sides more than happy to use historical injustice as an extra spur on these occasions. James Haskell, who has played all around the globe, has long since been accustomed to the phenomenon. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you used to run the world, isn\u2019t it?,\u201d he said \u201cIt\u2019s down to empire building. It\u2019s an easy motivation factor for other sides because of the long, entrenched history. It\u2019s very difficult for us to say that. If you know your history we are partly to blame.\u201d From Haskell\u2019s perspective \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t hate anyone\u201d \u2013 it is more about pressing the buttons that matter to him personally. He also argues home advantage, to some extent, is a figment of the imagination. \u201cI don\u2019t want to burst any bubbles but because we travel all the time it doesn\u2019t really matter where we are playing or what the records are. It comes down to trying to play your game and beating the opposition. What it means to them is kind of irrelevant.\u201d Not everyone will concur but Twickenham is not the diehard rugby citadel of folklore. The last time Haskell was there as a spectator the bloke in the next seat mistook him for Tom Croft, the price for having spent much of his career wearing a headguard. Interestingly, too, the Irish players are no longer the distant strangers they might have been before last summer\u2019s Lions tour when Haskell became good mates with, among others, Best and Sean O\u2019Brien. \u201cThe best thing about the Lions tour for me was meeting people and seeing them outside of the rugby arena,\u201d the Wasps flanker added. \u201cThere are a lot of people who cross that whitewash and turn into absolute nightmares. Then when you see them off the field they are like the loveliest bloke you have ever met. Johnny Sexton was a top guy, Conor Murray the same. Tadhg Furlong was a great hugger. I shared a room with him and was obviously looking a bit tired so he asked me if I wanted a hug. I looked at him and said: \u2018Come on then.\u2019 Then I put my clothes back on! That\u2019s bonding on tour.\u201d The hugging and kissing on this occasion will be reserved for the potentially epic post-match party should Ireland clinch their treasured slam. England will be bristlingly competitive but unless they drastically reduce their penalty count, a narrow Ireland success is the likelier outcome. Jones\u2019s platoon would love a final day win but Schmidt\u2019s glory hunters crave victory even more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
