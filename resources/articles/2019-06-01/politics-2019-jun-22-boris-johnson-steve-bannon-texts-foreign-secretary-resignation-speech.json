Johnson\u2019s column \u2013 for which he was paid \u00a3275,000 a year \u2013 regularly made headlines and it had been missed during the year he had reluctantly given it up to be foreign secretary. And now he was back. For the paper, it was already paying dividends. Beneath a photo of Johnson, the banner headline on the front page said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to believe in our Great Britain.\u201d And underneath, in smaller type: \u201cBoris Johnson in rallying call for the nation to look to a brighter, post-Brexit future.\u201d In a hotel room in central London, someone was giving careful consideration to the text: the man who had guided Donald Trump\u2019s path to power, Steve Bannon. He seemed to have no doubt: the headline, the framing of Johnson\u2019s forthcoming resignation speech, the \u201crallying call\u201d, these were the themes he said he and Johnson had \u201cgone back and forth on text\u201d about over the weekend. He was \u201cunequivocal\u201d about it, says Alison Klayman, the film-maker who captured it while shooting her forthcoming documentary, The Brink. There\u2019s no doubt the video is terrible timing for Johnson. It\u2019s not just that this link to Bannon, like so many things, is something he has denied. It was nothing more than \u201ca lefty delusion\u201d, he said last summer. And even up until last week, his team was keeping to the line that the contact was restricted to \u201cone text \u2013 an invitation to meet that Johnson declined\u201d. When told there was a video of Bannon talking about it, his advisers changed track. A spokesman told the Observer that the idea of him taking advice from Bannon was \u201cpreposterous to the point of conspiracy\u201d. He conspicuously failed to repeat the previous denials about the pair being in touch, however. But Johnson has been caught in lies before and shrugged them off. It\u2019s why Bannon compares him to Trump. He has described him as \u201cone of the most important persons on the world stage today\u201d and drawn the obvious comparison: \u201cLook at some of the scandals around Trump \u2013 the sexism and racism. Nothing sticks. You can\u2019t lay a glove on him.\u201d But what\u2019s new and potentially toxic for Johnson is what the apparent relationship with Bannon says about him. Johnson\u2019s love life is once again dominating the news, but it\u2019s his engagement with populist far-right politics and rhetoric that could and should worry other people more. Why? Because Bannon is the man who laid the groundwork for Donald Trump\u2019s victory. First as the executive chairman of Breitbart, the far-right website, and then as Trump\u2019s campaign manager and chief strategist. A man who is open in admiration of both Mussolini and Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson, the former EDL leader whom he described as \u201cthe backbone of Britain\u201d and who has been working with openly racist far-right leaders across Europe. Tamsin Shaw, a professor of philosophy at New York University who has been researching Bannon\u2019s world view, said: \u201cHe collaborated with publishers of neo-Nazi white nationalist websites to turn Breitbart into a platform for the alt-right. And his main initiative in the White House was the Muslim ban.\u201d Johnson did not welcome the reports last year that first suggested he and Bannon were close. When Matthew d\u2019Ancona, a Guardian columnist who had succeeded him as editor of the Spectator, wrote an article headlined \u201cIgnore Boris Johnson\u2019s sex life. His flirtation with Steve Bannon is the real worry,\u201d he was bombarded with calls from Johnson. \u201cI stopped counting at 15 \u2013 though the calls continued,\u201d he revealed in an article for news website Tortoise this year. Johnson then resorted to texts. The reason: \u201cBoris Johnson was furious with me for writing about his contact with Steve Bannon.\u201d Specifically, it was d\u2019Ancona\u2019s assertion that Bannon\u2019s advice had led Johnson \u201cto get off his knees and cause some mayhem; and to Johnson\u2019s extraordinary column in the Daily Telegraph shortly thereafter in which he wrote that a Muslim woman wearing the niqab resembled \u201ca bank robber\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d. The two were linked,\u201d wrote d\u2019Ancona. \u201cAnd this disclosure was not to Johnson\u2019s liking.\u201d For the \u2018One Nation\u2019 Tories who have backed Johnson, the video may make uncomfortable viewing. His appeal to the far right, by using dog-whistle, anti-Islam remarks, raises questions about how far down this road he is prepared to go. It was this key period last summer when Johnson moved from courting popularity, d\u2019Ancona believes, to being populist. And then there\u2019s Nigel Farage. Klayman says Bannon met Farage, as well as other European far-right leaders, during that crucial week. And they\u2019ve long been close. Is there a deal? Between Johnson and Farage? Farage\u2019s funder, Arron Banks, has been hinting at it for weeks: having Johnson as PM and Farage as deputy. They both fit what Shaw describes as \u201cBannon\u2019s MO \u2013 winning people over to racist views by making them laugh along\u201d. As long as it\u2019s just a joke and \u201cpeople laugh along with Johnson\u2019s one-liners, they\u2019re effectively disclaiming responsibility for racist views and policies and the people who aren\u2019t laughing are derided as humourless\u201d. And Johnson has shown no sign of letting up. He described May\u2019s deal as \u201cwrapping a suicide vest\u201d around Britain and, in a parliamentary debate in January, he deployed one of the American right\u2019s favourite themes warning of a \u201cplot by the deep state to frustrate Brexit\u201d. What\u2019s no longer in doubt is that Bannonism has entered mainstream British politics. Wherever that may lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
