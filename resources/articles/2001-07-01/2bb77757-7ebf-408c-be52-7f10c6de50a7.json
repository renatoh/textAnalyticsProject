Valery Gergiev's calling card as conductor has previously been the dramatic yet highly disciplined performances he has drawn from these forces. After the mixed reviews (to put it kindly) for the operas presented in the Royal Opera House over the past fortnight, it was to be hoped that this Requiem would restore some of the rigour that has reportedly been lacking. Gergiev conducted the Philharmonia in a searing concert of this same work only weeks ago in the Festival Hall. The Royal Opera House, however, is not a concert hall. Semi-hidden in the orchestra pit, Gergiev could not be a focus of the audience's attention for anyone other than those in the less expensive seats in the gods (there are no \"cheap seats\" for this Kirov season), and one realised what a magnetic visual presence he had been in the Festival Hall. Nobody dared blow his nose during the opening pianissimo then. The extra brass and drum in the Dies Irae, tucked away in one end of the Opera House pit, sounded ominously close to the audience, yet separate from the rest of the orchestra, when they should have formed part of a terrifying wall of sound. These hellfire choruses were arresting, but they inspired the fear of Gergiev rather than of God. The superficial discipline we saw at the start - 80 singers opening their music in perfect synchronicity - didn't always transfer to their performance, nor did Gergiev maintain constant control. There were several moments of shabby ensemble. However, when it really mattered, the precision was there - in the dancing imitative phrases of the Sanctus, and in the complex fugue of the Libera me. In this last movement especially, the luxury of a whole section of real contraltos gave the chorus a sonority that ensembles outside Russia just don't have. The young tenor soloist Daniil Shtoda has been making a name for himself recently; his ringing, sustained voice is certainly promising but shouldn't be pushed too hard just yet. Marina Shaguch's soprano pierced easily through the ensemble, but it was when she made the least effort to sing beautifully that she really succeeded. There was one real world-class Verdi singer in this line-up - the redoubtable mezzo Olga Borodina - and, with her ripe, poised performance, she didn't disappoint."}, "isHosted": false}}}
