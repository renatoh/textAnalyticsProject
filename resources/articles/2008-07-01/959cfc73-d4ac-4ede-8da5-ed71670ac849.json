The prolific Freud - who was born in Berlin but has lived and worked in London since 1947, and was the subject of a major exhibition at Tate Britain in 2002 - has often turned to his friends, family and fellow painters as subjects. His more famous sitters include the Queen, a pregnant Jerry Hall, Kate Moss and the benefits supervisor Sue Tilley. Freud's 1995 portrait of Tilley, called Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, sold for $33.6m (\u00a317.2m) at auction in New York in May, setting the world record for the highest price paid in an auction for a work of art by a living artist. The buyer was reported to be the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club. Benefits Supervisor Sleeping may be among the works included in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which will be on show from February to May 2012. According to the gallery's director, Sandy Nairne: \"Asking one of the greatest artists working anywhere in the world - and London-based - if he would make an exhibition with us seemed the right idea for 2012. I was thrilled when Lucian said yes. His portraits, spanning seven decades, will make an exceptional exhibition.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
