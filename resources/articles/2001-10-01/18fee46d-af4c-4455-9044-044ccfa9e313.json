Backed by co-religionists in Iran. Could force some representation in a government, though not as great a role as... ISMAIL KHAN A top former Mujahideen commander and 'emir' of the western city of Herat. Escaped from a Taliban prison to lead resistance among Persians in the west of the country from a base in Mashhad, Iran. At 54, still a popular and effective commander. A possible provincial governor in a new set-up. Another might be... ABDUL HAQ A portly former Mujahideen commander who through adept use of the media has kept his reputation intact. Still widely respected among Pashtuns. Flew in to Pakistan from Dubai two weeks ago. Likely member of any government. Wants senior Kabul Ministry or possibly mayoralty, but may not get it.

Would find it hard to sit at the same table as... GENERAL DOSTUM The 47-year-old Uzbek warlord trying to hack out a new power base in the north-east. Anything but a devout Muslim, he still retains strong ethnic loyalties and the support of Uzbekistan. Many changes of allegiance and numerous accusations of appalling human rights abuses. Rather like... MULLAH WAKIL MUTTAWAKIL The Taliban Foreign Minister. Less a moderate than a pragmatist. Intelligent and more wordly than most senior Taliban. A Pashtun from the Durrani branch - the traditional kingmakers - and from Kandahar. Seen as the acceptable face of the Taliban. Should the Taliban fall apart, he would be likely to feature in any kind of interim government, probably under... GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR 54, former commander of the most extreme of the Islamist Mujahideen groups and widely feared after his rocketing of much of Kabul. Hekmatyar, currently in Iran, has pledged his support for the Taliban, which probably rules him out of any future coalition. Sworn enemy of Dostum and... KING ZAHIR SHAH A Durrani Pashtun, in exile in Rome for 30 years. Retains much prestige and nostalgic support among ordinary Afghans, but is aged 86.
