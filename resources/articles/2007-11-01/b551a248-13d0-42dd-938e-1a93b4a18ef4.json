Being only human, managers prefer to laud their successes rather than lay bare their faults - including those which, like Stockwell, merit the label 'catastrophic'. Never forget Murphy's Law: 'If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of these ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it.' The path to failure starts with the perilous proposition that nothing will or can go wrong - coupled with oblivion for previous and current cock-ups. MbCU (Management by Cock-Up) is far more prevalent and influential than MbO (Management by Objectives) or any other such rational path to success. Yet Christian Sadler, an Innsbruck professor who has studied Enduring Success (the title of his new book) in true depth, includes this among its key principles: 'Remember your mistakes. Great companies tell and retell stories of past failures to make sure they don't repeat them.' That finding flies in the face of the undeniable tendency of managers to repeat errors - not excluding the very worst. Financial catastrophes such as today's come around with dreadful regularity. The dotcom collapse (only three years ago) differed from the current sub-prime disaster mainly in the genuine nature of the digital revolution and the enduring success of true leaders, like Amazon and eBay, even as 'smart' money poured into the leakiest corporations ever to strut their stuff. Brighter lights are no less susceptible to mismanagement. Thus eBay bought the promising Skype, whose internet phone service is chipping away at the telecom giants, for $2.6bn, overpaying by an admitted $1.4bn, or 54 per cent. The countless examples of this cardinal sin somewhat undermine another of Stadler's 'enduring' principles, printed in the Harvard Business Review: 'Diversify your business portfolio.' Diversifiers mostly feed not on painstaking analysis of profitable reality, but on two powerful forces: the lush availability of other people's money and the lust of ambition. Every manager must know that acquisitions are timebombs, half of which (at least) explode. Would any sane management, then, buy 34 companies in three years, or 60 in five? Yet those are the startling scores of Oracle (bill, $25bn) and IBM ($16bn). Does anyone count the true costs and analyse the failures behind these splurges? British officialdom has slavishly copied the private sector's spin approach to catastrophe. You dismiss disaster as best you can (eg, denying that \u00a3250m has purchased zero improvement in schoolchild literacy), and you furthermore claim, with scant evidence, that improvement is on the way, so that any valid criticism is out of date. This squirming attitude is what generates the mismanagement, not the other way around. Failure starts with a planning process dominated by wishful thinking and ends with blind and bland denial. Before and after, the wish is father to the thought and swamps thinking utterly. That's no doubt how the big-wishers at Northern Rock swapped the dead-safe economics of the building society for a high-flying, crash-prone model. Across the Atlantic, Bear Stearns, famed for the conservative safety-first strategy that kept it solid but stolid, observed the rapid pile-up of wealth in the new maximum-risk sectors. Tempted beyond endurance, but lacking the innate sense or understanding needed for these wilder shores, management over-egged two giant hedge funds, losing investors $1.6bn - along with its reputation. The catastrophes were not caused by the ambitions, but by the illness that attended them. Driving ambition lies behind every business success as well as every folly of unbridled greed. But that doesn't excuse the yawning difference between effective execution and humbling clumsiness. Doing things wrong is always a management sin - but less so if the errors are committed in a just cause. Steve Jobs can forget and forgive the four grisly flops that separated the breakthrough Apple II from the current iMacs. At long last the current range of computers is a hit, Apple's biggest earner, despite new wonders such as the iPod. Can Management by Cock-Up be prevented? Forget rules and regulations. The regulators are always too late and usually too feeble. As for fear of retribution and rolling heads, that's stifled by the same wishful thinking that drove the engine over the cliff. The only effective defence rests where the cock-ups originate - inside management. Firms need two Cassandras: the front-end seer who warns what can go wrong and at what cost; and rear-end analysis which mercilessly, if and when the venture fails, discovers why. The two abilities are not irreconcilable. Indeed, their combination helps to define the good manager and to stultify the bad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
