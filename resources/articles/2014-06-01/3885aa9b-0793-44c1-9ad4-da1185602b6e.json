Hutcherson returns to the label for its 75th anniversary, co-leading an unusual quartet featuring saxophonist David Sanborn, Hammond organist Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Billy Hart. The methods are outwardly familiar (mid-tempo swing, bebop twisters, organ blues-grooves and ballads), but it's all remarkably loose and selfless for such an all-star encounter. Hutcherson is subdued, but his clean tone and subtle voicings are unmistakable, and his three original songs \u2013 the funky Hey Harold, the dreamy Montara and the sleekly swinging Teddy \u2013 show why he made an impact in his prime as a composer as well as an improviser. Here the soulful Sanborn plays like a post-bopper more than a sax sermoniser, but his searing cries and speech-like exhortations keep bursting the confines of the chords. Meanwhile, DeFrancesco is punchily rhythmic but cliche-free (despite quoting from all over jazz, including Miles Davis's So What solo on Sanborn's Delia), and Hart is coolly supportive and judiciously provocative."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
