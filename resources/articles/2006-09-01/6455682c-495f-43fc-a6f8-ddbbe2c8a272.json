At their Brighton conference delegates voted down left-leaning Lib Dems in their attempt to retain a higher 50p rate of income tax for people lucky enough to be earning more than \u00a3100,000 and unlucky enough not to have an energetic accountant. Next comes the hard bit: can they sell their complicated new tax package to the voters or does yesterday's vote make it even more likely that Sir Ming will lead them into decline, weighed down by unpopular tax policies? Observers as different as the Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams and Robert Chote, of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, wonder if they risk confusing people who don't understand their proposals - and seriously annoying those who do, the ones who stand to pay an extra 4% to 5% of their substantial incomes in tax by means more subtle than that discarded 50p rate. Only time will tell. But Cable is adamant that he has not fallen into the same trap as John Smith's 1992 shadow budget: not enough tax winners compared with the tax losers - actual or potential - who were made even keener to keep Neil Kinnock out of No 10. Up to 90% of people will be better off on some estimates, even more than the erudite Cable's review team calculated as it struggled to balance \u00a320bn of tax cuts with \u00a320bn of extra taxes to pay for them, the largest part - \u00a38bn - being polluter taxes on cars, petrol and aircraft emissions. It may be high-minded and tax-neutral, but it offers rival parties a large barn door to hit. The political purpose of the review was to restore Lib Dem credibility on tax. Paddy Ashdown's pledge of an extra penny in the pound to fund education was dropped before the 2005 election. It still left \"high tax\" Lib Dems vulnerable to a Tory revival. Either way there can be little doubt that Cable and Chris Huhne, the party's equally cerebral green spokesman, are on to something. All sorts of voters are now concerned about the bullet points that summarise new Lib Dem thinking: taxes that are fairer, simpler and greener, as well as more local and more effective in doing the job. What job? Cutting taxes on the poorest - the bottom 20% pay 36.4% of their gross income in tax, 1% more than the richest 20%. Green taxes, like tobacco taxes, are meant to modify behaviour. Local income tax is meant to replace unfair council tax with greater local accountability, though Lib Dem thinkers still hanker after fair land and property taxes. It is risky stuff. Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Alan Milburn all grapple with thorny problems of fair and effective taxes. Cable knows the pitfalls and hesitates to curb even the generous residency rights of the super-rich. It is usually the fate of Lib Dem policy to be carved up by bigger rivals, the good stuff plagiarised without attribution, the unworkable ideas mocked to show how hopeless Lib Dems are. The party now has higher ambitions and this is a serious piece of work. The risks remain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
