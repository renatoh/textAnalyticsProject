After a two-year hiatus Apple has returned to win the 2004 Readers' Choice Awards for the brand with the most global impact\u2014a title held by Google since 2002. It's hard to imagine a brand having a shinier year than Apple. Notably punctuated with iMacs, iPods and iTunes, Apple's 2004 presence was felt in the press, in ads and on the streets, with iPod coming to define the word \"ubiquitous.\" Coupled with strong revenue, Apple reported a net profit of US$ 295 million in the last quarter of 2004 alone and a 2004 overall net income growth of 300 percent. Yes, 300 percent. Second in the list is the seemingly ubiquitous Google, followed by IKEA, Starbucks and, perhaps surprisingly, Arab satellite news channel al-Jazeera. Elsewhere, Nokia slipped three places on 2003 to 10th in the listing, and eBay comes in at number nine - a good show, all in all, from technology firms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
