Wonder no longer, Nick. Well, hopefully. Because compiling the stats of international football players can, at times, be a case of treading delicately through international politics too. The various incarnations of Yugoslavia (record appearances: Dragan Dzajic, 85 caps), Croatia (Darijo Srna, 107), Slovenia (Zlatko Zahovic, 80), Macedonia (Goce Sedloski, 100), Serbia (Dejan Stankovic, 102), Montenegro (Simon Vukcevic, 42), Serbia and Montenegro (Savo Milosevic, 101) Bosnia and Herzegovina (Zvjezdan Misimovic, 76) for example throw up all sorts of problems. So it's fortunate that none of them come even close to holding the record for the least capped footballer to hold his country's highest appearance record. Montenegro's Vukcevic, however, is the least capped, most capped footballer for a side in the top 30 of the Fifa rankings. Instead, we turn out attention to more exotic climes. The Northern Mariana Islands, located somewhere between Hawaii and the Philippines in the western Pacific Ocean, have only ever played 16 matches. Most of them have been against their near neighbours Guam who have something of a habit of thumping them. In fact everyone makes something of a habit of thumping them, with Nepal, Palestine and Bangladesh putting a combined 19 goals past them in their last three matches. Their most capped player is Joe Wang Miller, who also happens to be their top scorer with four goals in a total of 10 appearances. However, since the Northern Mariana Islands have only really properly been in existence as a national footballing side since 2006, when it was accepted into the East Asian Football Federation, they count as one of Nick's countries that are new to the international stage. So it is to another part of the Pacific Ocean we must go. Kiribati's first international match came against Papua New Guinea in 1979. They were hammered 13-0, which has rather set the tone. Two days after the PNG defeat, they were beaten 24-0 by Fiji and have yet to actually win a match in 10 attempts. Their last two have both, oddly, been 17-1 defeats (to Papua New Guinea again and Tahiti) and their most regular player has been Nabaruru Batiri who has turned out for them eight times, making him \u2013 as far as we can tell \u2013 the footballer with the least international caps to also hold a country's appearance record. There are others elsewhere, though none appear to hold as low a total as Batiri. Girdon Connor's record 17 appearances for Anguilla is good, while Kasim Abdullah's record 19 for the Comoros Islands is impressive too, though one quirky one is Waldemar Philippi's record 18 appearances for Saarland which we think takes the European record. The team only existed between 1950 and 1956 when the French occupied the German area in the wake of ther Second World War. The locals didn't want to play for France and considered themselves independent of Germany too, so set up shop alone. They played only 19 games, most of them against B teams, and entered the qualifying stages of the 1954 World Cup where they did manage to beat Norway 3-2 but failed to overcome their neighbours West Germany who went on to win the competition outright. By 1958, Saar had been reabsorbed back into West Germany and so Philippi's record is unlikely ever to be broken. Have we forgotten someone? Email us PERFECT PENALTIES \"Mario Balotelli's first penalty miss in professional football got me thinking,\" thinks Sandro Chung-Meiste. \"Has there been a player who never missed a penalty in professional football?\" In 1973-74, and not under David Moyes, Manchester United were relegated. In the first three months of that season, they were awarded two penalties, both taken by their goalkeeper Alex Stepney, and both scored. So miserable were they that at Christmas he was the club's joint-leading scorer along with Brian Kidd, Sammy McIlroy and George Best. Otherwise, it's hard to find anyone who never missed, at least in England. Rickie Lambert has 32 out of 32 for Southampton, but failed elsewhere, and Matthew Le Tissier managed a paltry 48 out of 49. As for those wondering about the vicious Ray Stewart, though he claims to have missed only five, his official record stands at 76 out of 86. But, as with most things, if you go abroad, you find them done properly. The record of GNK Dinamo Zagreb's Ivan Krstanovic is without blemish; he has scored \"at least 30\", also saying that \"Everyone keeps asking me to reveal my secret, but if I told everyone my technique, it wouldn't be a secret anymore, would it?\" Meanwhile, Ovidiu Herea, first of FC National Bucuresti and then FC Rapid Bucuresti, is also yet to miss, his record standing at 19 out of 19 \u2013 though it almost ended last season. In a game against CG Gaz Metan Mediase, he had a kick saved by Razvan Plesca, only for the referee to award a retake, which he subsequently scored. Other experts also round that Balkan way were Ledio Pano, who put away more than 50 consecutive penalties for a collection of Albanian and Greek teams, and Vladislav Stoyanov, who deposited 24 from 24 for PFC Chernomorets Burgas and PFC Lokomotiv Sofia, though he missed one for Chernomorets playing in the second division. In Germany, everyone has a 100% record. Not really, but Hans-Joachim Abel does, dispatching 16 of 16, for Fortuna Dusseldorf, VfL Bochum 1848 and FC Schalke 04, between 1972 and 1984. HENDON'S RUN \"Hendon FC have been playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division every season since 1963-64, having neither been promoted, relegated or switched league since,\" wrote Darren Beach last week. \"Has any other club at such a high level of the English pyramid been in the same division without break for longer?\" Let's turn this one over to reader Joe Murphy, who steers us away from England and up over the border to Scotland: \"While they might not be English, Stenhousemuir can beat Hendon's 50 seasons. From the 1921-22 season until the end of the 1997-98 (77 seasons) Stenhousemuir played in the variously named League One. For most of that time this was the lowest league in Scotland with two brief leagues being created in the '20s and '40s before League Two was permanently created in 1994. From that day on, it only took four years for Stenny to be relegated for the first time in their history.\" It's good but not the best. In England, Arsenal have famously only ever been relegated once in their history \u2013 at the end of the 1912-13 season \u2013 meaning they have been in the English top flight continuously since their return to it in 1919, giving them a run of 94 years. Everton, meanwhile, have not been relegated since their return to the top flight in 1954. While, in Belgium, Standard Liege can claim a similar record to Arsenal's, having also only been relegated once and remaining in the top flight since 1921. However, there are many that have done even better: Celtic have never been relegated from the Scottish Football League having been a founding club in 1890, giving them 123 years in the same division. In Spain, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have never played second tier football and were all founder members of the league in 1929 (an 84-year run). Inter have not been relegated in Italy since the creation of the Italian Football Federation in 1898 (115 years). In fact, there are many who can better Hendon FC's run (as long as their is only one exit route): Independiente have gone 65 years in Bogota; in Mexico America and Guadalajara have gone 71 years; Dinamo Zagreb have not been relegated in 67 years in the various Croatian top flights and Hajduk Split have not gone down since a league was created in the old Yugoslavia in 1918 (95 years). Hamburger SV have been in the German top flight since 1918 too, while Porto, Sporting and Benfica have been ever presents in the top division in Portugal since it was formed in 1934 (79 years). PROLIFIC DEBUTS (2) Last week we looked at the players who have made high-scoring first appearances for their clubs and one name (as plenty of you were keen to point out) was conspicuous by its absence. Len Shackleton scored six goals on his debut for Newcastle United in their 13-0 victory against Newport County in 1946-47. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Is Joey Barton the first player to be done by the FA for mooning?\" asked Eddie Rich back in 2006. Nope. In the 1970s, Terry Mancini (of QPR) and Sammy Nelson (of Arsenal) were both suspended for buttock-baring. Mancini, in the middle of a dispute over a possible transfer to Arsenal, gave the directors' box an eyeful of 'arris after one match at Loftus Road. The referee turned a blind eye to Mancini's, er, blind eye, but the incident was publicised on Match of the Day; as a result, Mancini was banned for two matches and fined \u00a3150. It sort of served its purpose, though: four days after bearing his arse, Mancini got his move to Highbury. Where he would meet Sammy Nelson, who himself mooned to the North Bank to celebrate scoring at both ends in a 1-1 draw with Coventry in 1979. He was banned for two weeks. That was that until 1988, when Wimbledon's Crazy Gang \u2013 led inevitably by that overzealous thespian Vincent Jones \u2013 celebrated Alan Cork's testimonial by standing on the halfway line and revealing their halfway lines to the whole of Plough Lane. Nine players had to pay \u00a3750 apiece to the FA for their art, with the club fined \u00a35,000 for failing to control their players' pants. \"It was Alan Cork's testimonial on the Monday night and we had won the FA Cup final on the previous Saturday,\" remembered John Scales, one of the Wimbledon Nine. \"We were sponsored by Carlsberg at the time so we got cans of Carlsberg coming out of everywhere. The partying had just gone on and it was in its third stage by that day; we were egged on by the supporters and we were easy bait.\" For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? \"In the 2013-14 Serie A there are four examples of clubs sharing grounds: Roma/Lazio, Genoa/Sampdoria, Inter/Milan and Chievo Verona/Hellas Verona.
