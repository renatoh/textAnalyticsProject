Although the same Victrix bolt-action rifle is marketed in the US as suitable for uses including \u201cmilitary\u201d and \u201claw enforcement\u201d, in Australia the Victrix (and similar weapons) are categorised with firearms licensed for hunting and sport. Gun control advocates have dubbed the Victrix guns \u201chigh-powered and military-style\u201d. They warn that an increasing range of these guns \u2013 which still have design specifications that allow them to be classified as sporting and hunting firearms \u2013 have hit the Australian market. Gun Control Australia has called for a rewrite of weapons classifications, which the group says are outdated and do not properly codify modern hi-tech guns. The group\u2019s chair, Sam Lee, has pointed to several examples of category A and B weapons (those licensed for hunting and sport) that come with a box magazine that can be easily modified to increase capacity. She said several weapons manufacturers were pushing models that had the base specifications of hunting or sports-shooting rifles, but with trimmings and capabilities that made them much more dangerous. \u201cThey\u2019re importing these firearms at very swift rates,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe category A and B were generally for single-shot and double-shot rifles and shotguns. The categorisation was set up in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre. That\u2019s 22 years ago and that hasn\u2019t kept up with advances in technology. \u201cGun manufacturers are obviously pushing the boundaries of those categories.\u201d Luca Scribani Rossi, a former Olympic shooting medalist and the managing director of Beretta Australia, which markets the Victrix range, said weapons companies did research and development to improve products, like other industries. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it complies with the law, then I cannot see the argument. \u201cThe way I see it is that in Australia we have gun laws and they\u2019re probably the strictest around the world. Any modification that takes [a gun\u2019s] magazine beyond [limits set out in firearms categories] is illegal. If people break the laws they become an offender and they need to be dealt with. That\u2019s not an industry or a manufacturer problem.\u201d Rossi said the Victrix bolt-action rifle was designed for long-range target shooting. When asked about advertisements that listed \u201cmilitary\u201d and \u201claw enforcement\u201d as suitable uses, he said long-range rifles were used for \u201cexactly the same sort of shooting\u201d as military snipers. \u201cI think the firearm industry is the only industry in Australia that is dealt with on emotion, rather than on facts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there are people speeding or drink driving, I\u2019ve never heard calls for a ban on cars that go more than 110km/h.\u201d The Shooting Industry Foundation Australia said the categorisation of weapons was by \u201cform and function\u201d. \u201cAll new firearm models are assessed before import and are approved and categorised by the federal government,\u201d Laura Patterson, from the foundation, said. \u201cThe reality is that GCA knows nothing about guns, and next to nothing about Australian firearms laws. [Their] frequent, incoherent and damaging comments only inhibit defence, law enforcement and civilian efforts to work together to protect this wonderful country.\u201d The foundation said actions such as a national digital register to track firearms transactions and replace the current paper-based system would improve community safety. Some jurisdictions, including New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territoy, ban weapons that are designed to look like military weapons. Last year NSW banned Desert Tech rifles on that basis. Shooters groups argue appearance bans are pointless, as guns cannot be publicly wielded or displayed. Lee said the ban on military-style weapons should be extended Australia-wide. A Brisbane resident, Michael Cahill, has complained about the billboard showing the Victrix bolt-action rifle, which he said was provocative and inappropriate. Gun Control Australia has called for it to be removed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
