The Stoke manager travelled back from Newport late in the afternoon and planned to watch the match from an executive box but said it was \"horrible\" looking on from the stand and that he felt compelled to move to the dugout for the second half. Stoke were trailing at the time but late goals from Kenwyne Jones and Robert Huth turned the game around. Pulis, however, admitted that as soon as the match was over he was consumed with grief again. \"Stoke City's my passion, my love, and I think Mum would've wanted me to be there,\" he said, reflecting on the events of 12 days ago. \"I had no intention of getting involved but I watched the first half from a box and, after starting very well, we dropped off a bit \u2013 it was horrible watching it. So I became fully engrossed and couldn't help myself. I'm passionate, that's the way I am. \"The disappointing thing was [his mum's death] happened on the day of the game because, as you know, you want to keep it in house, in the family, and for it to come out publicly was a bit of a bind for me to be honest.\" Pulis received a rousing reception from the Stoke supporters when he walked along the touchline at the start of the second half, although he claimed that he was too focused on the match to notice. \"I don't want to sound blas\u00e9 about this but [at the time] I'm just really more concerned about the team and trying to get the result we wanted. That was all that was on my mind,\" Pulis said ahead of tomorrow's match at Newcastle. \"Getting to the game, watching it, I switched off from the grief, but watching that first half was dreadful. I just got totally engrossed in the game. But as soon as it finished, I switched back again into that mode.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
