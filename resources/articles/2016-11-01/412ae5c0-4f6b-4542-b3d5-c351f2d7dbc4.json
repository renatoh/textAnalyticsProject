Tottenham positively bounced out of the stadium here; a derby of see-sawing fortunes across 96 minutes and at times thudding levels of intensity might not ordinarily be considered the best preparation for a decisive Champions League away tie three days later, but the thrill gained from such an unlikely escape act raised their manager\u2019s hopes that it might feed something similar in Monaco on Tuesday night. \u201cFor the players that victory was very important, and it was emotional,\u201d Pochettino said after a first success in seven games. \u201cYou know always the stress or adrenaline is high, and it\u2019s a relief. This can help us believe again that we can win. To keep this feeling will be very important in preparing for the Monaco game. It is a game we must win.\u201d If residual exuberance is a factor in his team selection at Stade Louis II, where Tottenham do indeed require three points to hold realistic hopes of reaching the knockout stage, then perhaps Harry Winks should brace himself to break more boundaries. It was the 20-year-old academy product, starting a Premier League game for the first time, who equalised Michail Antonio\u2019s header in the 51st minute to ignite a hitherto patchy game and if the euphoria of his celebrations are matched in Monaco then something will assuredly have gone right. Winks, all wide eyes and whirling arms at the fulfilment of a lifelong dream, leapt into Pochettino\u2019s embrace after his big moment. \u201cTo be honest I found him, he didn\u2019t find me,\u201d a beaming Pochettino explained of their coming-together. \u201cBut it\u2019s true that I put a lot of pressure on my players in the changing room \u2013 I like my hugs.\u201d There were plenty more of them after Harry Kane\u2019s two late goals and then, when things had calmed, there was a touch from Winks that suggested he has the attitude required to become a more regular presence. \u201cI like it a lot that he came into my office afterwards to say thank you to all of us \u2013 the coaches,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt was a fantastic show for everyone, for all the people who work in the academy. He said to us this is only the start. I said: \u2018Come on now, this is a big challenge.\u2019 He said: \u2018Yes, now I need to work hard and try to show that I deserve to play.\u2019 \u201cThat is the mentality we want. It\u2019s true he needs to be happy now and enjoy the moment, but he needs to know the future will be difficult. To keep that level is the most difficult thing.\u201d Winks performed diligently alongside Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in a midfield diamond and it will not have escaped Pochettino\u2019s attention that he began the move for his goal \u2013 a simple enough finish after Vincent Janssen\u2019s shot was saved \u2013 by dispossessing Angelo Ogbonna 40 yards up the pitch. His selection had seemed a gamble and it was not the only one. Janssen was selected to partner Kane and for long periods Tottenham lumbered, short of the craft that Son Heung-min would eventually bring from the bench. It seemed like a miscalculation from Pochettino and this certainly did not seem to be his day when, having delayed Dele Alli\u2019s introduction for Janssen while a Dimitri Payet corner was defended, he saw the striker needlessly haul Winston Reid over and concede the penalty from which Manuel Lanzini put West Ham 2-1 up. The away side were then rarely troubled until Kane sprang to life, tapping in a Son cross that Darren Randolph could only push into the forward\u2019s path and converting a penalty 162 seconds later after Havard Nordtveit had chopped down the South Korean. They deserved better but this has been an accursed season for Slaven Bilic and in hindsight the introduction of Nordtveit for Payet, in an attempt to shore things up with five minutes to play, looked misguided. \u201cWe were 2-1 up and from our point of view it was a logical move to put on a fresh body,\u201d a quietly-spoken Bilic said. \u201c[Payet] was excellent today but we thought: \u2018OK, it\u2019s the end of the game, we are winning, let\u2019s hold on.\u2019 I would rather play well, the way we did tonight, than come here after the game and say: \u2018No complaints, they were much better.\u2019 When you are playing like this, it is only a matter of time before more luck or more concentration makes the difference.\u201d This time the fortune was with Pochettino, and a match that could have changed the complexion of West Ham\u2019s season became one that may do the same for Tottenham. There will be hugs all round on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur if that impression persists a little longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
