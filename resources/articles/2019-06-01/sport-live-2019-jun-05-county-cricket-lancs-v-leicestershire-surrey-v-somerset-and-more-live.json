Let's see when he gets the ball. Eventually out for 60, Essex 81 behind on first-innings, a fine fightback. Finbar Anslow who you might remember wrote in with the lyrics to his song Taunton Town, has sent the YouTube Link. Somerset fans, I think you\u2019ll rather like it. https://youtu.be/QFpDVcBYzq8 I\u2019m at Aigburth, where the sun is out and the players are pottering onto the pitch. Two quick question apropos of nothing : 1 why are balloons banned at Liverpool Lime St? 2 Has any transport minister ever spent a few hours at Manchester Victoria ? The smell of diesel trains is eye -wateringly unpleasant. A fluctuating day at Guildford ended with Surrey on 99 for two, needing another 168 to beat Somerset. Surrey had lost the remainder of their first-innings wickets cheaply in the morning, the Overton twins finishing with eight between them. Somerset then subsided to 153 all out with only 64 from James Hildreth sparing their blushes. Matt Dunn pocketed five for 43. Nottinghamshire suffered a batting apocalypse at Edgbaston in the Division One wooden spoon game. After Warwickshire had eventually declared on 391 for nine with a century for Adam Hose, Notts were ravaged by Jeetan Patel\u2019s six for 16 and were all out for 97. They fared better following on, closing on 116 for one. Essex avoided the follow-on at Headingley thanks to some blistering boundaries from Peter Siddle in his 39 not out under glowering skies. They had been cruising mid-afternoon against Yorkshire after 77 from Tom Westley and smart runs by Ravi Bopara but lost three for one before tea. Nerves were jangling around Lord\u2019s as Middlesex came within an hour of saving the game. Sussex started the day needing six wickets but met unexpected resistance. Nick Gubbins fell in the morning session but James Harris (80) and John Simpson (76) batted through until tea, gritty runs in the face of Ollie Robinson with a bracelet of slips. But Sussex were not to be denied and with their coach, Jason Gillespie, on the field as substitute fielder, they took the last wicket with 12.4 overs to spare. Robinson finished with seven for 98. Glamorgan soared to the top of Division Two thanks to outstanding bowling from Michael Hogan and Marchant de Lange, beating Northamptonshire by an innings and 143 runs. It was their second win of the season and their first win by an innings since 2014. At Aigburth the chill wind did not detract from an intriguing day when Lancashire ascendancy switched to Leicestershire obstinacy and back again. Leicestershire were in deep trouble at 82 for five at lunch, but Mark Cosgrove and the debutant Harry Swindells inched them forward in a partnership of 50. Dieter Klein and Callum Parkinson were in touching distance of avoiding the follow-on when Richard Gleeson had one of his inspired spells, removing Klein 13 short of what would have been a debut first-class century and Leicester 12 short of the target. Leicestershire had to survive four overs of their second innings from Graham Onions and Gleeson but nightwatchman-opener Chris Wright confidently left a ball from Onions and was bowled for a duck. At Chester-le-Street, Derbyshire got to within shirt-tugging distance of Durham thanks to 79 not out from Matt Critchley. Ravi Rampaul then tore through Durham\u2019s batting with three for 39. Alex Lee flew the flag with 63 not out. Where's your killer instinct Sussex? See Glamorgan and weep. I better write up though this is going to be the most exciting session of all. Ps Notts still haven't lost a wicket. Well, well, Stoneman bowled Brooks for 12. Surrey need 259 to win at Guildford. If you're in the area, pop by, should be a cracker. What an innings this is by James Harris at Lord\u2019s_65 not out. And BTW Roland_Jones was Robinson s fifth wicket., It\u2019s all getting a bit twitchy all round. SEVEN Down at Lord\u2019s. Leicester defences starting to grate on Lanes fielders. Still, new ball soon. NOTTS ALL OUT 97. They didn\u2019t look this bad at Trent Bridge in April. They\u2019re not this bad. Also apologies if punctuation haywire, I've had to resort to emergency tablet. Notts creep, gasping, towards three figures. And a wicket at Lord's! Harris for 80. Somerset_when I wasn\u2019t looking have thrown their dice in the air and come up with 153 for nine. You\u2019re supposed to be winning the Championship, you can t do this. You probably know this, but Kohli is out. INDIA 94 for two off 22. Apologies technical problems have got in the way of these scores_but Notts are in trouble and Middlesex seem safe. At tea Middlesex are holding on. Remarkable. Partnership of 103 between James Harris and John Simpson. Can Sussex find five wickets amongst the jam tarts? Can Notts be out in a session and a sneeze? 87 for EIGHT It\u2019s all happening at Guildford and Edgbaston. A third for Morkel and Somerset are down to their tail - 119 for six. Notts 79 for seven, Moores goes cheaply again. After last year\u2019s run-glut, things have grown a little parched. Keaton Jennings, Mr Neat and Tidy, cajoles his body into a swallow dive to catch Swindells at short leg off Liam Livingstone. Leicestershire 150 for seven at just over the half-way point in the day. Michael Hogan 4-32 but, Billy Root - this one\u2019s for you. That Notts-up? It\u2019s on. 75-6 on the slowest, most benign pitch of the round. Patel 2-1, Norwell 2-6. Glamorgan can taste the sweet tang of victory, just one wickets needed now as Marnus Labuschagne gets in on the act. Rob Jones removes his trousers as the fielders all swap places. Harry Swindells, on debut, looking slimly unperturbed, 26 not out. Leicester 132-5. Make that 132-6, Cosgrove out for 70, which is Leicestershire\u2019s joint highest first-class score this season, Onions bringing the ball back into him. The umpire waited, five, six, seven seconds before sending him on his way. Against all predictions, James Harris and John Simpson look as if they could hang on at Lord\u2019s. Michael Jones has gone early in Durham\u2019s second innings - Ravi Rampaul of course. 20-1. Notts and Essex lose a post-prandial third - Nash for 25 and the aforementioned Westley for 77. While Northants are on the brink - 180-7, still 158 behind - Hogan and de Lange the incisors. Hildreth 33 not out at Guildford, as Somerset recover. Nash and Clark rebuild at Edgbaston after the wicket of Ben Duckett - 65 for two. Tom Westley 77 not out at Headingley - could he be the first player to reach three figures in this match? Balls flying about in a state of uncontrolled undress here at Aigburth. Gleeson causing trouble from the River End. India have been set 228 to win by South Africa. Trickier than it looked at one stage, but should be a breeze. Maybe there is time for a podcast in your life? Maybe it is this one? Hosted by Emma John, who has a fab new book out on Bluegrass music, it takes a merry look at the World Cup and all things cricket. It turns out that if you lie down flat on the grass at the Mersey end and tuck your socks into your trousers whilst using a natural windbreak of fallen chairs, the sun warms your legs. Don\u2019t mention this to anyone in real life. Meanwhile Cosgrove thunders through to his fifty and Bavuma falls at The County Ground. Six more Glamorgan, six more. Division One Somerset 344 and 50-3 (Morkel 2-12) v Surrey 231 (Patel 63; Coverton 5-38, Joverton 3-46) Somerset lead by 163 Warwickshire 391-9dec (Hose 111) v Nottinghamshire 18-1.

Leicestershire lose their fifth wicket for 86 and the groundsmen invade the pitch with wheelbarrow and rake. Lunchtime scores to follow. Well batted Northants and Middlesex - losing just three and one wickets in the morning session. If they keep going at that rate, they\u2019ll be safe - just... I wonder, is that the faint whiff of the start of a Notts-up blowing up the west coast? Another wicket at Guildford. South Africa are doing a Warwickshire - 123 for five off 30. The matches are coming thick and fast now - follow the dynamic double act of Nick Miller and Simon Burnton for Bangladesh v New Zealand here: A wicket at Guildford.... but it is Abell, Morkelled for 9. Somerset 21/1. David Wiese spoils the scorecard but breaks the impasse, Middlesex lose a fifth - Gubbins lbw for 33. 122 for five and still 200 behind, though they have now avoided falling to their worst defeat since the second world war. Essex quietly plugging away at Headingley - Fifty for Tom Westley and 34 for Nick Browne - 91 for one. Today\u2019s the day. At last. Warwickshire have put everyone out of their misery and declared - 391 for 9, Adam Hose a hidden century. Not even Notts version 2019 can be out twice in less than two days on this pitch. No they can\u2019t. Watching Mark Cosgrove bat, the years roll away and Greg Ritchie appears on the horizon with his gleaming white teeth. Short of leg, jolly of stomach, Cosgrove holds the bat as if it was a toy and is remarkably keen on getting down on one knee for an industrial unit. Oh, and as always, when I was looking the other way, Ackermann goes for the drive and is caught. He is reluctant to leave, but has little choice, he\u2019s been sent on his way. He\u2019d already had a life after being dropped by Liam Livingstone at slip. Leics 61 for four. Surreyt 231 all out. COverton 5-38, Joverton 3-46, a deficit of 113. It\u2019s suddenly easier to bat at Lord\u2019s - Nick Gubbins and James Harris in a partnership of fifty. Remember today is the last day of this match and Glamorgan v Northants. Loving the train in the background here. I think, adjusts anorak, it\u2019s the Guilford via Cobham line. Matthew Critchley leading Derby towards Durham\u2019s hinterland. 59 not out, 225 for 7, they trail by 68. A third catch for Tom Cullen at the County Ground, Northants 93/3 -245 behind. I\u2019ve just eaten my fourth Danish pasty in three days. In my defence it is freezing even in a mother-in-law knit, woolly hat and manager\u2019s coat. Oh no! Ben Curran felled - at least he made fifty, Northants 89 for two, 249 behind Glamorgan. Surrey collapsing! Joverton 5-38, Surrey 223-9, though Patel still there on 55. I hope no-one took annual leave for the snooze-fest at Edgbaston. It\u2019s the morning of day 3 and Warwicks are still batting....350 for 8. Oh my, Leicestershire. Paul Horton caught and bowled by a ridiculously athletic Bailey . Leicestershire 17 for three and this could be over today. A straight-forward catch to Keaton Jennings at first slip, after Neil Dexter pushes forward slightly overbalanced to another fine ball from Tom Bailey. Leicester 16 for 2. Also, a little mention for Ratcliffe CC. A few years ago I went along for a piece on West Indians in the Lancashire league. Off I trotted, bringing the kids as it was the holidays. Some lovely folk in the bar showed me around, sold us some cheap squash and then played with the kids on the pitch. It was a faded glory, targeted by vandals, but you could sense its once-majesty in the photos on the wall and the crumbling stands. It used to be standing room only for cup games. They deserve a new mower. And a third for Craig Overton at Guildford as Surrey\u2019s impenetrable skin wears fingernail thin. Jacks caught by old slow hands at slip for 13. Surrey 201 for six. A huge appeal by Lancashire against Paul Horton! Ten seconds worth of tongue-warbling. Nowt says the ump - Bailey walks back to his mark. A wicket! Onions through the gloom gets Azad onto the back foot. No stroke and that my son is out I\u2019m afraid. Leicestershire 13 for one. Graham Onions, green soles on his shoes, chugging in from the Pavilion End, a short one, which flies past the outside edge of Horton\u2019s bat. The next one is fiercer, passing the outside edge. I don\u2019t fancy Leicester\u2019s chances here. I see South Africa are having a shocker, 26 for two from six overs with Bumrah inspired. Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 188-5 Surrey trail by 156 with 5 wickets remaining Warwickshire 311-7 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 v Essex 18-1 Essex trail by 372 with 9 wickets standing Division Two Durham 293 v Derbyshire 181-6 Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day three) Middlesex need another 282 to avoid innings defeat Northamptonshire 209 &amp; 68-0 v Glamorgan 547 (after day three) Northants need another 270 to avoid innings defeat There\u2019s something very heartwarming about following a trail of old boys with anoraks and thermal picnic bags from Aigburth station and watching them embrace their buddies outside the cricket ground. What news will they tell? Good morning from a remarkably dry Aigburth. In front of me the Leicestershire players are doing \u2018pogos\u2019 at the request of their physio, while Glenn Chapple throws slip catches. Hats are firmly on. There will be 104 overs today to try and catch up. Looking round the grounds, it\u2019s woolly weather this morning but the forecast is better than yesterday. Lord\u2019s and Guildford look particularly intriguing. In other news, huge congratulations to Stephen Fay and David Kynaston who have won the Telegraph Sports Book of the year with Arlott, Swanton and the Soul of English Cricket, after being pipped to the post by Geoff Lemon in the Wisden and MCC Awards. It\u2019s a lovely read, I recommend it. And of course, India\u2019s World Cup gets under way today, at Hampshire against wobbly South Africa. South Africa really must win it to have a chance of a semi-final spot - an unenviable position.
