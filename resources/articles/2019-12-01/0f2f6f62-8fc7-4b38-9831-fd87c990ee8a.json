The discussions were said to have been positive and the two parties are planning further talks soon. Silva was sacked on 6 December after a 5-2 defeat against Liverpool and Everton have been working on finding a replacement ever since. The caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson, has overseen two games, beating Chelsea 3-1 at home before drawing away at Manchester United on Sunday. Ancelotti left Napoli on Tuesday 10 December after poor domestic form had led to their falling behind Internazionale and Juventus in Serie A and the fact that he had taken the team into the last 16 of the Champions League on the same night was not enough to save his job. Ancelotti would relish a return to the Premier League, having managed Chelsea between 2009 and 2011, winning the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. Everton confirmed on Monday that Ferguson will remain in charge of the team for the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Leicester on Wednesday. A club statement said: \u201cDuncan Ferguson is to remain in caretaker charge of Everton for Wednesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup quarter-final against Leicester, the club can confirm. \u201cA sell-out crowd will welcome Ferguson and his players out of the tunnel at Goodison Park for the visit of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side as the Blues look to book a place in the last four of the competition. John Ebbrell, Francis Jeffers and goalkeeper coach Alan Kelly will again be alongside Ferguson in the home dugout. \u201cIn the 11 days since Marco Silva left the club, the Everton board has been working to recruit a new permanent manager \u2013 and has held meetings with a number of candidates. We can confirm that thus far no contract offer has been made and no candidate has chosen to withdraw from the process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
