There is a kind of fin-de-si\u00e8cle decadence that pervades each work, even though in the case of Strauss's opera Capriccio, this is nostalgia written half a century after the fact. In creating a programme in which these two works were pillars, composer John Woolrich added his own contribution to the exploration of late German romanticism in the form of his orchestrations of a number of Hugo Wolf's Italian Songs. In arranging the songs for string ensemble rather than simply tweaking the vocal line for instrumental soloist, Woolrich has imbued them with an entirely different character, which betrays little trace of their origins, particularly as the vocal line shifts through different instrumental voices, sometimes highlighted by a solo instrument but at others absorbed into the texture. The result is a series of string-orchestra vignettes, a somehow more satisfying solution than the song-without-words arrangements of works for instrument and piano. Woolrich's other contribution to the programme was his own Capriccio, a miniature violin concerto written for the Scottish Ensemble and its artistic director, Jonathan Morton, as soloist and premiered at this year's Proms. As the title might suggest, there are moments of whimsy \u2013 echoes of Piazzolla tango and jazz rhythms. The overall tone of the work is surprisingly dark and mysterious, inhabiting something of the nocturnal world of the adagios of Bart\u00f3k and Shostakovich. The virtuosity of the solo line reaches a peak with a manic danse macabre, after which the lone voice of Morton's violin soars over the ensemble's darkly atmospheric soundscape in a clever parallel to the evocative textures of the Schoenberg that followed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
