The Tri-Nations organisers are concerned at the financial implications of the Springboks' actions, which upset sponsors and broadcasters and followed a dispute in the Super 14 earlier this year when New Zealand's leading players missed the first half of the competition to concentrate on preparing for the World Cup. \"The three countries have discussed the issue robustly and it will never happen again,\" said the Australian Rugby Union chief executive, John O'Neill. \"There was a distinct recognition that World Cup year was a problem but it is a case of ensuring the Tri-Nations is scheduled properly.\" The tournament may be expanded in future, with Samoa talking to South Africa and Australia about them fielding a side. Edinburgh yesterday rejoined the Scottish Rugby Union after resigning last week in a dispute over money. The side's owner, Bob Carruthers, said Australia's outside-half Stephen Larkham would be joining after the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
