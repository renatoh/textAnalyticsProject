The insurer first said the loss hadn't been reported to local police, then asked for receipts for goods and later offered her considerably less than she claimed. While almost every other travel insurer has been happy to waive the normal caveats concerning claims by tsunami victims, Columbus Direct has made the process so tortuous for Jessica Aldous that she considered giving up her claim. Ms Aldous, who says she was lucky to escape with her life, was first told by Columbus Direct that it would not be paying her claim because she hadn't reported the loss at the local police station. It then demanded she provide receipts for every item, and offered her just a quarter of the amount she had claimed. Ms Aldous, was travelling with two friends in Unawatuna near Galle in Sri Lanka when the wave struck. \"We were woken up by lots of shouting and came out the room in the beachside guest house to see a huge wall of water coming towards us. We, along with everyone else, just ran for our lives and survived by climbing on to the roof of a house. Eventually, we got to higher land where we spent the next few days waiting until we could physically get back to the resort.\" When she finally got back there she found a scene of devastation. After going to her room, which was on the first floor, she found her passport and a few other items. After walking 20km, and being helped by the Sri Lankans with a number of lifts, she managed to get back to Colombo where she made her way back to the UK via Germany. \"In many ways I feel very uncomfortable even bringing this up when so many people lost their lives. We only survived because we happened to be at one end of the bay, and nearer the high land. I find the idea that we should have reported our loss to the police as just incredible. All the buildings were destroyed and, even if they had been standing, it would have been incredibly insensitive to even attempt such a thing.\" She says she was still in shock for several weeks after arriving home, but filled in the claims form. \"I had an annual policy costing \u00a370, and sent the form in with as many receipts as I could find. I'd hoped that I would be able to make the claim and then try to move on.\" However, Columbus immediately wrote back asking for the police report and for more receipts. After several letters she was eventually offered just over \u00a3500 by the company - her original claim had been for \u00a32,000. \"They kept asking for more receipts. I sent in as many as I could and even sent copies of bank statements but they refused to accept this as proof of purchase. Columbus had already made it clear they would not pay the \u00a3300 it cost me to get back from Frankfurt - the only place we could get a flight to - and my claim hadn't included that. After the company refused to return her phone calls calls she almost gave up. \"A bit of me thinks that it is only money and it's not important when you consider that so many people lost relatives. \"However, people need to be aware of Columbus Direct's behaviour. Both my travelling companions had policies with other firms and their claims were dealt with without any fuss. My friend who bought a \u00a320 policy from Boots was paid more than she claimed. If Columbus's people can deal with someone who has been through a tragic event like this, how are they going to treat someone who just gets their rucksack stolen in the normal way,\" she asks? Paul Ditmer, Columbus Direct spokesman, first denied that the company had insisted on a police report - but after looking at the correspondence admitted the company had done so. Speaking in the week of the St Paul's cathedral service, attended by relatives of the 148 Britons who died, he admitted he was disappointed by the way the claim had been handled. \"We are sorry and I will be writing to Ms Aldous to apologise for any distress caused. I have been back to the underwriting department and they have agreed to immediately up the offer by \u00a3350. But at this stage they refuse to go further. \"The problem is that we have a maximum claim of \u00a350 where a receipt is not produced - we will be contacting her now with a view to finding a way to increase the final payment.\" Mr Dittmer says the company, which only received 45 claims as a result of the tsunami, insists on all receipts in the event of a claim, although he admitted those ringing up to buy policies are not warned about this this. \"Our terms &amp; conditions state that receipts and police reports are required, although I agree we should have acted more sensitively in this case,\" he said. \u00b7 Columbus Direct is in no way related to Columbus Travel Insurance which also offers travel policies. m.brignall@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
