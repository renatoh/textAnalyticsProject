My FAQs about Trump, Biden, the election and what happens next", "bodyText": "You\u2019ve been in or around politics for more than 50 years. How are you feeling about Tuesday\u2019s election? I\u2019m more frightened for my country than I\u2019ve ever been. Another four years of Donald Trump would be devastating. Still, I suspect Biden will win. But in 2016, the polls \u2026. Polling is better now, and Biden\u2019s lead is larger than Hillary Clinton\u2019s was. What about the electoral college? He is also leading in the so-called \u201cswing\u201d states that gave Trump an electoral college victory in 2016. Will Trump contest the election? Undoubtedly. He\u2019ll claim fraudulent mail-in ballots in any swing state Biden wins where the governor is a Republican \u2013 states such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Arizona. He\u2019ll ask those governors not to certify Biden electors until fraudulent ballots are weeded out. What\u2019s his goal? To deny Biden a majority of electors and throw the decision into the House of Representatives, where Republicans are likely to have a majority of state delegations. Will it work? No, because technically Biden only needs a majority of electors already appointed. Even if disputed ones are excluded, I expect he\u2019ll still get a majority. What about late ballots? Trump has demanded all ballots be counted by midnight election day. It\u2019s not up to him. It\u2019s up to individual state legislatures and state courts. Most will count ballots as long as they\u2019re postmarked no later than election day. Will these issues end up in the supreme court? Some may, but the justices know they have to appear impartial. Last week they turned down a request to extend the deadline for receiving mail-in ballots in Wisconsin but allowed extensions to remain in place in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. But the supreme court decided the 2000 election for George W Bush. The last thing John Roberts, the chief justice, wants is another Bush v Gore. With six Republican appointees now on the court, he knows its legitimacy hangs in the balance. Trump has called for 50,000 partisans to monitor polls while people vote, naming these recruits the \u201carmy for Trump\u201d. Do you expect violence or intimidation? Not enough to affect the outcome. Assume you\u2019re right and Biden wins. Will Trump concede? I doubt it. He can\u2019t stand to lose. He\u2019ll continue to claim the election was stolen from him. Will the Democrats retake the Senate? Too close to call. If not, can Biden get anything done? Biden was a senator for 36 years and has worked with many of the current Republicans. He believes he can coax them into working with him. Is he right? I fear he\u2019s overly optimistic. The GOP isn\u2019t what it used to be. It\u2019s now answerable to a much more conservative, Trumpian base. If Republicans keep the Senate, what can we expect from a Biden administration? Reversals of Trump executive orders and regulations \u2013 which will restore environmental and labor protections and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Biden will also fill the executive branch with competent people, who will make a big difference. And he\u2019ll end Trump\u2019s isolationist, go-it-alone foreign policy. And if Democrats retake the Senate? Helpful, but keep your expectations low. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had Democratic Congresses for their first two years yet spent all their political capital cleaning up economic messes their Republican predecessors left behind. Biden will inherit an even bigger economic mess plus a pandemic. With luck, he\u2019ll enact a big stimulus package, reverse the Trump Republican tax cuts for the wealthy, and distribute and administer a Covid vaccine. All important, but nothing earth-shattering. If Biden wins, he\u2019ll be the oldest man to ever be president. Will this be a problem for him in governing? I don\u2019t see why. He\u2019s healthy. But I doubt he\u2019ll seek a second term, which will affect how he governs. What do you mean? He\u2019s going to be a transitional rather than a transformational president. He won\u2019t change the underlying structure of power in society. He won\u2019t lead a movement. He says he\u2019ll be a \u201cbridge\u201d to the next generation of leaders, by which I think he means that he\u2019ll try to stabilize the country, maybe heal some of the nation\u2019s wounds, so that he can turn the keys over to the visionaries and movement builders of the future. Will Trump just fade into the sunset? Hardly. He and Fox News will continue to be the most powerful forces in the GOP, at least for the next four years. And what happens if your whole premise is wrong and Donald Trump wins a second term? America and the rest of the world are seriously imperiled. I prefer not to think about it.
