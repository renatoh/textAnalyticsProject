The public defenders, led by Sajid Khan, stepped up to support Persky with an open letter and petition calling for judicial discretion that has, as of Friday afternoon, received nearly 300 signatures, most of which are from public defenders and defense attorneys. The letter reads: \u201cIf judges had to fear direct, personal repercussions as a result of their decisions in individual cases, the rule of law would suffer.\u201d It also said: \u201cJudge Persky applied the applicable laws, reviewed the right circumstances and factors that he was required to review, did not abuse his legal authority and utilized the discretion afforded to him to render a reasonable, fair sentence within the confines of the law and in line with the probation recommendation.\u201d In a detailed blog post explaining his position, Khan, a deputy public defender for Santa Clara County, said that \u201cthe culture of mass incarceration has warped our psyches into thinking that lengthy jail or prison terms are always the answer to criminal behaviors like sexual assault. They\u2019re not.\u201d In an interview, Khan said that public pressure for judges to impose harsher sentencing \u2013 however understandable the wellspring of outrage \u2013 could have the unintended consequence of affecting the sentences given to poor and minority defendants the most. \u201cWe felt that there was an absence of understanding of the potential impact that a recall effort would have on our justice system,\u201d Khan said, \u201cand in particular public defender clients - minorities and the underprivileged \u2013 in the justice system.\u201d The convicted Stanford swimmer, Brock Turner, was arrested for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in an alleyway in January 2015, after two Swedish students saw the assault in progress and intervened. He was convicted in May 2016 and sentenced to six months in county jail and probation \u2013 a punishment far less severe than the minimum prison time of two years prescribed by state law for his felony offenses. In sentencing, judge Persky appeared to suggest that he felt the defendant had \u201cless moral culpability\u201d because he was drunk, and that a light sentence would be an \u201cantidote\u201d to the anxiety Turner had suffered from the media scrutiny of the case. Enraged by details such as coverage of Turner\u2019s swimming career and a statement from his father saying that he had already paid \u201ca steep price ... for 20 minutes of action\u201d, as well as a moving statement from Turner\u2019s victim that went viral, the public responded with outrage to the case, leading to the recall effort against Persky. Khan said the group of public defenders was \u201cconcerned \u2013 and I am concerned \u2013 that this recall effort ... will deter judges from expressing discretion and compassion in their sentences, and encourage them to issue harsher sentences for fear of being reprimanded or condemned\u201d. \u201cWe would hate to see the pendulum swing that way, where judges are issuing harsh sentences [for fear of public] backlash.\u201d Instead of encouraging all judges to give harsh, custodial sentences, Khan said, a better approach would be one that encourages judges to be compassionate to all defendants, not just those as privileged as Turner. \u201cFor those that are outraged that Mr Turner benefited from white privilege and saying he should have been punished more harshly, and because of that the judge should be recalled,\u201d he said, \u201cour concern is that it will have the reverse impact: it will trickle down [disproportionately] on to minority clients.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
