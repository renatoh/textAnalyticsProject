Jazz also has its fair share of complacent old timers, and sax and trumpet heroes Michael and Randy Brecker, who started their careers in the early 1970s, fall into that category. The Breckers are touring to promote not one collaborative new album but two solo ones - a fact that sets alarm bells ringing immediately. Despite its outward veneer of fossilised fusion, the duo's music is entrenched in the bop tradition of an opening chorus followed by a sequence of solos. It's a weary formula at best, and it left the Breckers scrapping tediously over the spotlight. The pair huffed and puffed, producing ever more strident, over-played solos, all notions of pacing, inter-solo continuity or interesting group composition forgotten. Trying to trace a path from Louis Armstrong to this is like seeking out the link between Elvis Presley and ELP, and just as much of a waste of time. The American saxophonist Joshua Redman has also mastered all the hallowed vocabulary of jazz, and while he has yet to inject it with anything searingly original, he at least makes an effort to be approachable. His populism manifests itself in silky- smooth, blues-drenched phrasing, and he has a penchant for memorable little hooks that keep resurfacing in different textural configurations. Apart from his effortless hipness, Redman's main strengths are a sense of vulnerability and a merciful shunning of the loud and obvious. The performance was res-trained until the final number, which swaggered into a dazzling outro of funk breaks and general rock'n'roll mayhem. Reassuringly for the future of jazz, the audience who had applauded the Brecker Brothers so warmly the night before were won over completely. Brecon jazz festival"}, "isHosted": false}}}
