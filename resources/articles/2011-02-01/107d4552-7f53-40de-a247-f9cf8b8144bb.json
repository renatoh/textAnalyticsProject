The on-loan Aston Villa midfielder could even be handed his Newcastle bow against Everton on Saturday with Joey Barton doubtful with a thigh injury. Barton first picked up the knock on Friday in training but felt the strain again during the warm-up ahead of the Bolton game and withdrew 20 minutes before the clash at St James' Park. Ryan Taylor \u2013 sent off against the Trotters for a stupid challenge on Johan Elmander \u2013 will be banned for the clash with Everton. But Ireland believes he has fully recovered from a knee problem and is ready to play for the first time since he appeared for Villa against Liverpool in December. The attacking midfielder would give Newcastle a lift after Barton's influence was missed against Bolton. Pardew told the Chronicle: \"Stephen actually wanted to play against Bolton and now he could make his debut against Everton. It depends on Joey. Ryan is suspended for sure and Stephen has a great opportunity. He sent me a text on Saturday saying: 'I'm ready to play.' He knew Joey got injured in training and, fair play to him, you want players who are desperate to play.\" Reflecting on Barton's injury, Pardew said: \"No, it's not precautionary. He is a doubt for next week against Everton. It's a huge blow.\" But Pardew feels that the return to full fitness of Ireland will benefit the Magpies while Shola Ameobi is also ready to play again after recovering from a broken cheekbone. \"We'll have Stephen and Shola back next week and be better for it,\" Pardew said. Hopefully we'll have Joey back, but we'll see. \"We've got everything to play for. It was good that Sunderland got beaten. We're a win away from jumping above them and we're already looking forward to next week.\" Newcastle remained in ninth spot but pegged another point back on Sunderland and again have the chance to climb into a possible Europa League spot against Everton. Meanwhile Nottingham Forest have been linked with a loan move for Danny Guthrie but Newcastle say there has been no official inquiry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
