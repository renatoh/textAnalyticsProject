The 32-year-old has scored 59 goals for Chelsea since his \u00a315m transfer from Bolton in January 2008 but his contribution has been eclipsed by the emergence of Daniel Sturridge. A move to Montreal in Major League Soccer, or China with Shanghai Shenhua, should be confirmed next month. Alex The Brazil centre-half was a rugged performer when Chelsea ground out clean sheets at Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers this season but he has failed to convince Villas-Boas that he deserves more opportunities in the first team. A lack of starts has prompted his request to leave, with the 29-year-old likely to turn to Serie A, and possibly Juventus, to revive his career. Josh McEachran The 18-year-old midfielder represents Chelsea's future but a lack of opportunities over the first half of the season is likely to herald a loan move away from Stamford Bridge next month to gain first-team experience elsewhere. Bolton had expressed an interest, though McEachran may prefer to link up with the former Chelsea reserve-team manager Brendan Rodgers at Swansea City, where he could thrive in his attacking midfield brief. Ryan Bertrand His non-inclusion in the Champions League squad cost him an appearance in Leverkusen, when Ashley Cole was injured, and he can be considered a high-quality, youthful back-up to the experienced England international. But with Patrick van Aanholt likely to return from an unsuccessful loan at Wigan Athletic, Bertrand may leap at the chance to play elsewhere on loan for the second half of the season. Off in the summer Didier Drogba A modern-day Chelsea icon, Drogba's contract expires at the end of the season, with his attempts to secure a new two\u2011year deal having been rebuffed by the club. Given the signing of Romelu Lukaku, his days appear increasingly numbered and there is an acceptance that a parting of the ways may be close, with a lucrative move to the Middle East or back to Marseille in the offing. Salomon Kalou The Ivorian boasts a prolific record as a substitute in recent times, having scored in each of his past three cameos for the club, but a lack of first-team opportunities will see him depart at the expiry of his contract in the summer. There will be interest in the versatile 26-year-old from rival English clubs, with Arsenal established as long-term admirers, as well as from clubs in France. Paulo Ferreira The defender signed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004 has become this club's forgotten man, his appearances limited these days to the Carling Cup at best. Ferreira was given a new five-year contract in 2008 despite being at best the second-choice right-back and was included in the Champions League squad at Ryan Bertrand's expense this season, presumably for his experience, but did not travel to Bayer Leverkusen for the previous group game. Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa The Portuguese right-back had his deal extended last summer and began this season in the starting XI, only to slip to the fringes in recent weeks following some shaky defensive performances. Cynics might argue that, by triggering the clause in his contract, Chelsea merely ensured they would secure some kind of fee for the defender who cost the club \u00a316.3m in 2008. Potential recruits Alvaro Pereira The left-sided Porto utility player was close to moving to London last summer, only for Chelsea to resist meeting the release clause in the Portuguese's contract at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. The 26-year-old has since signed an extension to his contract, taking it to 2016, with the \u00a325.7m clause retained. Yet Chelsea are expected to renew their attempts to secure him regardless. Luka Modric Chelsea have long craved a creative midfielder and targeted the Croatian last summer. Tottenham Hotspur's unwillingness to countenance his sale has reaped dividends, with the north Londoners above Villas-Boas's side in the table and appearing likely to return to the Champions League next season, though Modric's commitment to the cause will be tested should Chelsea come calling again. Gary Cahill The Bolton centre-half has attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and, most persistently, Tottenham in recent months. He is out of contract in the summer and is expected to leave the Reebok Stadium next month. A fee of about \u00a37m could take him to Stamford Bridge, where he would renew the centre-half partnership with John Terry that has been employed by Fabio Capello at international level. Eden Hazard The Lille playmaker has indicated that this is likely to be his last year with the current French champions, though he may consider a move to Spain, where Real Madrid head the queue as his most fervent admirers, preferable to London. A slippery creator, he boasts the quality to thrive. Kevin De Bruyne The Genk teenager was targeted over the summer, though no fee was agreed with the Belgian club. The winger's stock remains high after showing flashes of quality over the course of his team's disappointing Champions League campaign, and he has made public his desire to follow Lukaku and Thibault Courtois from Belgium to Stamford Bridge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
