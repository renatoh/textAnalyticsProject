On Tuesday, though, England face the \u201cbaddest\u201d women footballers around, a USA team dripping with talent, swagger and a confidence that verges on arrogance. With their operations team sniffing around the England team hotel, scouting out digs for the final, there is an expectation they will win. With the USA there always is. It is a winning mindset that Neville has tried to emulate and drill into his players. He says he can feel it, see it in their eyes, that the Lionesses are ready to win. \u201cWhat I understand [badass women] to mean is, you don\u2019t just want to come to a World Cup, make an impact but then be forgotten,\u201d says England\u2019s Nikita Parris. \u201cMia Hamm, and those girls, have made an imprint on football for the rest of history. \u201cThat\u2019s what Leah is talking about. She\u2019s talking about making history. Giving young girls the chance to not only reach the top but make sure they make their mark.\u201d The winger, who will be playing on her new home turf having just signed for Lyon, believes England can knock the USA off their perch. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we think we can\u2019t be \u2018badder\u2019 than them when we went to the SheBelieves and we won it? We went toe-to-toe with them, you know? We have beaten the Americans in the past. We beat them 1-0 under Mark Sampson. Why shouldn\u2019t we think we can beat them? Why do we have to come to this tournament semi-final and think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s America?\u2019 \u201cNobody fears America. Nobody fears Germany. Nobody fears England. They know that on the day, no matter who you are, if you perform and get the best out of each and every player on the field of play, you\u2019ll win the game. I don\u2019t fear America and I don\u2019t think my teammates do.\u201d A SheBelieves Cup is all well and good, an exhilarating 2-2 draw with USA in that friendly competition the highlight, but World Cup football is a different beast. USA\u2019s 13-0 defeat of Thailand in their opening game gave them momentum but hard-fought 2-1 wins over Spain and France in the knockout stages have cut through the air of infallibility. \u201cWe\u2019ll know tomorrow how we\u2019ve progressed as a team. USA are the No 1 team in the world so people will back them,\u201d Parris says. \u201cUltimately both teams want to win. It\u2019s a massive game, for us and them, and a really exciting time for women\u2019s football. Especially in England \u2013 we\u2019ve come a long way. We\u2019ll be going toe-to-toe with the Americans and we want to win that game. We\u2019ve come here to win this tournament.\u201d Parris will be crucial to that task. Alongside Lucy Bronze, the pair form the most potent threat on England\u2019s right, with Jill Scott orchestrating their movements and combining with the pair to telling effect. They will be up against the left-back Crystal Dunn and the USA\u2019s player of the tournament thus far, on and off the pitch, Megan Rapinoe. Rapinoe and her five-goal compatriot Alex Morgan will need to try to breach the strongest defence in the tournament, with Steph Houghton and Millie Bright at its heart. The England manager has a decision to make in midfield, the usually assured Kiera Walsh has looking shaky shielding the defence. In America, Neville tried Bronze alongside her for the strength she offers though it is unlikely he will pull her away from the battle with Rapinoe. There is, though, the option of the more steely Jade Moore. In the buildup to this World Cup much was made of the 20th anniversary of the \u201c99ers\u201d, the USA World Cup-winning team who took the success of their victorious 1991 side to the next level and catapulted women\u2019s football into the mainstream. The 2019 USA shirts are a nod to the historic victory. Should England win then they have a chance to similarly write their names in history. \u201cYou have to respect America for respecting the pioneers of the game,\u201d Parris says. \u201cThat\u2019s important. We do that a lot in our game in England. What they\u2019ve done for women\u2019s football across the world is massive. It\u2019s brought about a way in [which] people now respect the game. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect what people in the past have done to allow us to be in this moment. I\u2019m so grateful for people like Casey Stoney, Fara Williams, Alex Scott, Faye White \u2026 I could reel them all off because they\u2019ve brought the game into a position now where we\u2019ve really got something to fight for.\u201d Parris\u2019s fight, though, is seemingly in the genes. Her sister Natasha Jonas was the first British woman to box at the Olympics, in 2012. Jonas was also a promising footballer but when injury ended her dream she was forced to find another path to being an elite athlete. \u201cThe biggest thing I got from my sister\u2019s career was never to give up,\u201d she says. \u201cShe had so many ups and downs throughout her career. Injuries and big injuries \u2013 ACLs. And she never gave up, she always came back fighting. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that my sister was the first female boxer in the Olympics. That\u2019s history. She made her mark. And that\u2019s what you want to do in any sport. \u201cHer and Jill Scott always said the same: never get too high and never get too low. Jill said it and I remember my sister saying it. Always stay in a happy medium in sport because you never know what\u2019s around the corner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
