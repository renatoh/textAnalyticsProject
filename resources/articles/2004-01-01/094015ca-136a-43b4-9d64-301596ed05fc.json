Jair Du Cochet is one of 11 confirmed entries for the Grade Two contest, the notable absentee being Jonjo O'Neill's Keen Leader. Jair Du Cochet got the better of Best Mate at Huntingdon in November but was pulled up on his only start since, in the Pertemps King George VI Chase at Kempton. Ricou, considered by many to have given Jair Du Cochet too much to do when chasing home One Knight at last year's Cheltenham Festival, would appear to have the backing of the seven-year-old's connections. \"The owner is not too keen to use an English rider, and it is not a question of rider, it is a question of an old problem,\" explained Macaire. \"We have a lot of horses in training here and it is important to keep a good mood in the yard. When you have a good team it is difficult to change it, and if I do, it may leave me with many problems for the rest of the season.\" He added: \"Jair Du Cochet worked this morning and is fine. He ran well at Chel tenham last year. His performance was very good, but I think he is even better now.\" Another below-par run by Jair Du Cochet on Saturday could see the gelding switched from the Gold Cup to the Cathcart Chase. The presence of Therealbandit adds extra spice to the Pillar Chase. Currently favourite for the SunAlliance Novice Chase, Martin Pipe's prolific winner could well be upgraded to the Gold Cup if he can mix it with the likes of Jair Du Cochet, Sir Rembrandt, Truckers Tavern and Valley Henry on Saturday. The Cheltenham card, the last racing at Prestbury Park before the Festival in March, also features four competitive handicaps. The sponsors have opened betting on the Ladbroke Chase and make Hand Inn Hand 4-1 favourite, with Whereareyounow and Telemoss both 5-1 and Horus and Irish Hussar next on 7-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
