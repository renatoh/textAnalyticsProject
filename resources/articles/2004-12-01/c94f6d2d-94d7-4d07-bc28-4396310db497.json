According to Hoddle, the match against Crewe was a 'must-win' game for him. But Wolves were held to a 1-1 draw. Gillingham, though, beat their bottom-of-the-table partners Rotherham 3-1 to increase the gap between the two to nine points. In Wolves' case, Hoddle's disappointment was offset by the spirit his team showed in fighting back from a goal down. That goal was scored by Wolves defender Joleon Lescott, who deflected a Dean Ashton flick from a David Vaughan free-kick into his own net. It could have been even worse for Wolves, because Ashton then hit a shot against the bar. However, the pressure Wolves put on Crewe in a pulsating contest finally paid off with a last-minute equaliser from Carl Cort. The game at Molineux was one of the best matches of the day. It was rather different at Gillingham, especially in a dire first half. But the home side seemed much more likely to score than Rotherham, and it was no contest when they stepped up a gear or two after the interval. Cardiff missed a good opportunity to improve their position at the bottom when they allowed Sheffield United to come from behind and beat them 2-1. Cardiff gained the upper hand four minutes before half-time. Peter Thorne played Neil Harris in on the left and the centre-forward, on loan from Millwall, marked his first match in Cardiff's starting line-up by firing the ball into the bottom corner. But Cardiff's Graham Kavanagh was shown a red card for a wild lunge on Jon Harley and Cardiff were destroyed by goals from Andy Liddell and Andy Gray. One team who really should have done better were West Ham, whose poor performance in the first half at Preston - combined with an excellent defensive dis play from the home team in the second - led to a 2-1 defeat. Among the players who attracted particular attention was West Ham defender Tomas Repka. It was his glaring error just before half-time - when he passed straight to Brian O'Neil instead of clearing his lines - that enabled O'Neil to put Preston 2-0 ahead. Repka then redeemed himself with the cross from which West Ham substitute Nigel Reo-Coker reduced the arrears. Reo-Coker was the star as West Ham strove to get back on level terms. Their best chance to do so came when he laid on a great opportunity for Marlon Harewood, only for Harewood to hit a wild shot well wide. In addition to Reo-Coker, there were also excellent individual performances from Coventry's Gary McSheffrey and Derby's Paul Peschisolido. McSheffrey, the scorer in the 1-0 win over Watford, could easily have had a hat-trick - he twice hit the woodwork. Peschisolido was equally prominent in the 2-0 victory over Plymouth. He played a part in the first goal, with a cross which was diverted into the net by Plymouth defender Graham Coughlan. Then, having been denied a goal through an excellent blocking save by Romain Larrieu, Peschisolido made no mistake when a tremendous through ball by Grzegorz Rasiak put him in another one-against-one situation with the keeper. It was Derby's fifth away win and pushed them into eighth place in the table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
