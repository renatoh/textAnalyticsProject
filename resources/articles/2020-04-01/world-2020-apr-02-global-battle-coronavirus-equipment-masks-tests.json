The masks were on a plane at Shanghai airport that was ready to take off when the US buyers turned up and offered three times what their French counterparts were paying. Jean Rottner, a doctor and president of the GrandEst regional council, said part of the order of several million masks heading for the region, where intensive care units are inundated with Covid-19 patients, had been lost to the buyers. \u201cOn the tarmac, they arrive, get the cash out \u2026 so we really have to fight,\u201d he told RTL radio. Rottner would not identify the buyers, who they were working for or which US state the cargo was flown to, but another French official also involved in procuring masks from China said the group were acting for the US government. \u201cThe icing on the cake, there is a foreign country that paid three times the price of the cargo on the tarmac,\u201d R\u00e9naud Muselier, the head of the south-eastern Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region, told the French channel, BFMTV. The Guardian has contacted the US state department for comment. A senior administration official told AFP \u201cthe United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France. Reports to the contrary are completely false.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau described such reports as \u201cconcerning and asked officials to look into similar claims that masks were being diverted away from his country. \u201cWe need to make sure that equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada, and I\u2019ve asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports,\u201d he said on Thursday. At a press conference in Brazil on Wednesday, the health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said recent attempts by Bras\u00edlia to purchase protection gear such as gloves and masks from China had fallen through. \u201cToday the US sent 23 of their biggest cargo planes to China to pick up the material they had acquired. Many of our purchases, which we had hoped to confirm in order to supply [our health system], fell through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world wants [these things] too. There is a problem of hyper-demand.\u201d Mandetta asked ordinary Brazilians to make themselves homemade masks from pieces of cloth so that health professionals could have the remaining professional equipment. As the pandemic worsens, panicked governments have been accused of using questionable methods to acquire supplies in the battle against the coronavirus. Tactics have ranged from blocking exports of medical supplies to sending spies on clandestine missions to find tests. Fearing shortages and a strain on their health systems, a number of states, including France, Germany and Russia, have taken measures such as stockpiling masks and hazardous materials, or hazmat suits. This has meant limiting exports of protective medical equipment. Turkey allegedly went further, not only banning exports of protective gear but also appearing to renege on foreign sales of masks that had already been paid for. Reports by the Belgian newspaper Le Soir and the Italian daily Corriere della Sera said Turkish-made masks destined for those countries had never arrived. In Italy, it took more than two weeks following a phone call from the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for the masks to be released. In Belgium, supplies had still not been delivered despite a formal police complaint from the country\u2019s health ministry. Turkey has also threatened to commandeer domestic mask producers to make sure they are provided only to the state. The local news outlet Hurriyet quoted the interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, as saying that authorities would seize factories if companies did not agree to sell on an exclusive basis to the health ministry. China, the world\u2019s largest mask manufacturer, was the first country to be hit by the Covid-19 outbreak and was also accused of stashing its supplies. It has, however, since been one of the few countries to go the other way, selling or donating millions of masks to Europe. One such shipment bound for Italy went through the Czech Republic, where it was seized by authorities under disputed circumstances. Czech authorities denied allegations of state-backed stealing by Giornale Radio Rai, the radio news arm of Italy\u2019s public broadcasting company, RAI. They said the masks had made their way to a warehouse north of Prague, where they were confiscated in an anti-trafficking operation. The foreign minister, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, later said his government had sent 110,000 masks to Rome as compensation. A similar incident occurred in Kenya, where a shipment of up to 6m masks bound for Germany mysteriously disappeared while passing through the east African country, although there has been no suggestion that the government was responsible. Drugs and coronavirus tests are also being coveted around the globe. After the US president suggested, without fully backed scientific evidence, that a common anti-malaria drug could treat Covid-19, India immediately moved to ban exports of hydroxychloroquine. Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency has launched several clandestine international operations to fly in hundreds of thousands of coronavirus testing kits. Local media reports, citing unidentified medical and intelligence officials, suggested the kits had been bought from an enemy state that would not want such a deal to be made public. Many countries do not recognise Israel becauseof its treatment of the Palestinians. A few governments have even moved in recent weeks to stockpile domestic food supplies. Kazakhstan, a major flour producer, banned exports, and Vietnam, the world\u2019s third largest rice exporter, did the same. Serbia moved first to block medicine and then sunflower exports. Global food shortages are not anticipated and most countries have kept their markets open, but efforts by anxious governments to wrest control of resources have many spooked. Abraham L Newman, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s department of government, and Henry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University,said there was a risk of the world \u201csequestering into distrust and selfishness\u201d. \u201cThe high level of mutual suspicion currently brewing between states will make it harder to coordinate an international response,\u201d they wrote in the Havard Business Review. \u201cIt is hard for governments to be generous when their citizens are frightened and supplies are tight. Yet it may lead to a spiral of fear and retaliation.\u201d German media reported last month that the Trump administration had offered a German medical company large sums of money for exclusive access to a vaccine. Despite the fact that the company, CureVac, denied the reports, the incident clearly rattled other countries. China\u2019s state-run Global Times published an editorial describing the search for a vaccine as \u201ca battle that China cannot afford to lose\u201d. Citing the reports on CureVac, it said: \u201cGiven the two leading western countries\u2019 moves, we can see there is no way for China to rely on Europe or the US in vaccine development. China has to be by itself in this crucial field.\u201d Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin \u2022 This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to change the headline to better reflect the content."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
