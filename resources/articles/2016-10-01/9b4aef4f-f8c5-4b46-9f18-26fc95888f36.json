While adoption will only be appropriate for a minority of these children, it can be transformative, offering them the best chance of growing up in a stable, permanent, loving home. The 12% drop in the number of children being adopted in the year ending in March is therefore deeply concerning. Experts believe this will be followed by even steeper falls, as applications for placement orders, the first step in the adoption process, have fallen even more markedly. This is an area fraught with sensitivity: the decision to remove a child from their parents\u2019 care is one of the utmost gravity. Yet there is a great deal of evidence that in recent decades, courts have been too reluctant to make this call, at huge cost to children\u2019s lives. Martin Narey, the former chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, observed in his 2011 investigation into the adoption system: \u201cFrequently, a child is living in observed neglect for many months, years sometimes, before first being removed to care.\u201d Adoption faces similar issues in the courts. For too long, it has been seen as an option of draconian last resort, appropriate only in the most exceptional of circumstances. Adoption rates have only risen when senior politicians such as Tony Blair and Michael Gove have made the issue a political priority. The recent fall in adoption is associated with a 2013 court ruling made by Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, which implied adoption is only appropriate as a last resort when \u201cnothing else will do\u201d. This has paved the way for a renewed reluctance by the courts to approve adoption orders, despite guidance that has since been issued to make clear this ruling did not constitute a change in law. Instead of being considered for adoption, some children are being placed with kinship carers, even when that is clearly not in their best interest. In response, the government is revising adoption law to restate best practice. This is to be welcomed: for too long, some of our most disadvantaged children have been failed by a system that makes decisions based on misplaced ideology rather than evidence about what is best for the child. \u2022 Comments will be opened later today"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
