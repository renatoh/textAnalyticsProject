Francesca O\u2019Brien, who was selected last month to stand in the target constituency of Gower, in south Wales, wrote a series of inflammatory comments about the Channel 4 programme on her Facebook page. In posts that have since been deleted, she wrote in January 2014: \u201cBenefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!\u201d In response to a friend\u2019s comment, she wrote: \u201cMy blood is boiling, these people need putting down.\u201d In further comments under her post, O\u2019Brien apparently endorsed a friend\u2019s suggestion for \u201ctwat a tramp Tuesday\u201d to \u201ctake your batts [sic] to the streets\u201d. After being approached by the Guardian, O\u2019Brien apologised for the comments which she said were \u201coff the cuff\u201d. The comments, which have drawn condemnation from O\u2019Brien\u2019s rival for the seat, are likely to anger the thousands of people in Gower who rely on benefits. They will also strike a blow to the Conservatives\u2019 hopes of winning the seat, with the constituency being a key marginal. O\u2019Brien\u2019s rival for the seat, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, said she was dismayed at the comments. \u201cThese are disappointing comments from Francesca, and I\u2019m sure lots of people will find them really insensitive,\u201d she said. \u201cMuch of the work of an MP is helping people, who through no fault of their own, find themselves in difficult situations. \u201cThis lack of empathy should worry anyone who isn\u2019t born with a silver spoon in their mouth.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, called for the prime minister to remove O\u2019Brien as a candidate. \u201cThis is absolutely disgusting and reveals the cruelty at the heart of the Tories\u2019 benefits cuts. Universal credit was deliberately designed to punish people who are out of work,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of us have relied on social security support at some point in our lives and it is nothing to be ashamed of. This person is not fit to be an MP and Boris Johnson should remove her as a candidate.\u201d Benefits Street, which highlighted the lives of benefits claimants on a road in Birmingham and made a star of one of its participants, Deirdre Kelly or \u201cWhite Dee\u201d, prompted controversy when it aired in 2014. The programme attracted 4 million viewers but also more than 100 complaints to regulator Ofcom relating to unfair, misleading and offensive portrayals of benefits claimants, alleged criminal activity and excessive bad language. O\u2019Brien\u2019s comments came after the first episode aired in January 2014. When she wrote that people on Benefits Street need \u201cputting down\u201d, a friend replied: \u201cand im the man for the job and tomorrow is twat a tramp Tuesday take your batts to the streets lol\u201d. They added that they had \u201cjust swam 1000m and i cant move so i might have to just shout abuse.\u201d In response, O\u2019Brien wrote: \u201cI\u2019m liking that idea\u2026 haha, made me laugh!\u201d O\u2019Brien, 32, was selected by the Conservatives to run for the seat only last month after an open primary at a local golf club. She works as a manager at a car mechanic business ran by her family in Gower. After being selected, she said: \u201cI have lived and worked in Gower all of my life, so I know the challenges people face here. I have a real passion for this area. It is a fantastic place to live, but I want to make it even better.\u201d Gower was won by Labour by little more than 3,000 votes at the 2017 general election and is a key marginal that the Conservatives will be targeting in order to win a majority. It was won by the Tories in 2015 by just 27 votes. According to figures produced by Swansea council in January, more than 3,000 people in the Gower constituency area claim incapacity benefits and more than 2,500 receive disability living allowance. Meanwhile, 2,150 people are on pension credit and 1,110 are on universal credit. O\u2019Brien said: \u201cThese comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
