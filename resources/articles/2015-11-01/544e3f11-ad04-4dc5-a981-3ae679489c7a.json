The tang of salt and seaweed in the air seems almost palpable \u2013 but that\u2019s just an illusion, because this isn\u2019t a day out on the headland; it\u2019s the latest immersive digital experience. This one has been dreamed up by the National Trust. Part of the 50th anniversary celebrations for what is now the Neptune Coastline Campaign \u2013 the trust\u2019s ambitious mission to buy swaths of the British coastline to save it from development \u2013 One and All launches on 4 November at nationaltrust.org.uk/oneandall, alongside a physical installation at Somerset House in London. \u201cWe\u2019ve got over 775 miles of coastline under the care of the National Trust,\u201d says Tom Freshwater, the trust\u2019s contemporary arts programme manager. \u201cWhat we are looking to do now is very much about managed access to the coast, people\u2019s enjoyment of it and the wildlife potential that it has.\u201d With its name a nod to poet John Betjeman\u2019s paean to a Cornish bay ruined by human intervention, the exhibition draws together specially created work by Sheers, music producer Martyn Ware and the artist Tania Kovats, with footage from film-maker Ben Wigley helping to create an intense encounter with our ever-changing shores. The approach, says Freshwater, not only removes the conundrum of where best to locate such an exhibition, but also brings it to a wider audience. \u201cSo much of our life now, for many people, exists with a screen in your hand,\u201d says Freshwater. \u201cWe wanted to go where people were to get our message across.\u201d Inspired by locations along the Gower coast in south Wales, Sheers\u2019s evocative poetry captures his response to a collection of dramatic scenes, from the dark interior of Paviland cave to the rocky expanse of Worm\u2019s Head. Accompanying his readings are names and places recited by local people, with stunning footage shot by Wigley against a rich soundtrack that he captured when he went on location with microphones in his ears. \u201cI really wanted an immersive experience online that you lost yourself in,\u201d says Wigley. \u201cBinaural sound recording is a fantastic way of doing that.\u201d Taking a very different tack, Ware visited the post-industrial coastal locations of Seaham, Porthgain and Orford Ness with a bright blue beach hut in tow. Passersby could enter the empty hut and press a red button inside to record their recollections of the coast. \u201cI wanted it to be really about the human stories, rather than about the technology or about my take on it,\u201d says Ware. The resulting collection of memories, conversations and musings is combined with other sounds and layered film by Wigley, resulting in a touching, nostalgic depiction of our shores. \u201cOne of the main reasons why I use film is because it feels to me the closest representation to memory,\u201d Wigley says. The online experience will also feature a digital artwork by Kovats, who has created a tidal map of the UK that evolves in real time. \u201cWe\u2019ve stripped tidal information from all the measuring points around the UK and that\u2019s being uploaded into the drawing so that it is in sync,\u201d she explains. Although Kovats\u2019s map is only online, a large bell \u2013 cast by her on a Cornish beach \u2013 will mark the tidal motions of the river at Somerset House. \u201cThe bell is going to be rung at high tide on the Thames,\u201d says Kovats, revealing that it will be audible even outside. The exhibition will run at Somerset House until 13 December. Housed in four rooms and featuring a pier-like boardwalk, the installation will project specially adapted versions of the work in huge archways. \u201cI want visitors to have as complete an immersion as possible,\u201d says Sheers. \u201cI want them to step into that room and on to the cliffs of the Gower \u2013 but not just visually.\u201d Ware is hoping to create an immersive 3D soundscape. \u201cThe exhibition room has two rings of speakers, one at ceiling level and one at ground level, and within that cube of speakers we have the capability of moving all the different sounds around in three dimensions in any direction we wish,\u201d he explains. Ultimately, he hopes it will encourage visitors, both online and off, to delve into their own memories. \u201cIt will hopefully make them more aware of their sensory environment next time they go to the seaside \u2013 and help them appreciate it a little bit more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
