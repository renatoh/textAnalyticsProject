Jack Boultbee, who until three weeks ago was the executive vice-president of the company which owns the Daily Telegraph, was fired after failing to reach an agreement on \"certain issues\". Three other executives - Lord Black himself, the chief operating officer David Radler and Peter Atkinson - stepped down from their posts last month and agreed to reimburse the company with their share of the payments. Don Jack of Toronto-based law firm McDonald &amp; Hayden, says Mr Boultbee, who received \u00a3350,000, was told the payments had been authorised. Mr Boultbee believes he should not have to repay the money and that he was given no choice about leaving the company, according to Mr Jack. \"He was told either to resign or be dismissed,\" said Mr Jack. \"He refused to resign and they fired him. He was going to be fired whether he repaid [the payments] or not - they were taking the position he should resign and repay.\" Mr Boultbee is claiming wrongful dismissal and is seeking to lift a block imposed on stock options he has in Hollinger. He is also claiming damages for lost reputation, along with punitive and exemplary damages. Mr Jack said his client had \"suffered significantly\" and his claim would \"certainly exceed $1m\". Mr Boultbee has lodged a \"notice of claim\" in an Ontario court, which must be followed with a \"notice of action\" - but a new claim could be filed to include more defendants, Mr Jack said. Lord Black's Toronto-based holding company Hollinger Inc - which controls Hollinger International through 73% of its voting interests - warned in a regulatory filing last week there could be \"no assurance\" that Hollinger International would be able to recover the payments made to Mr Boultbee. When Mr Boultbee was fired on November 17, Hollinger International said it had terminated his employment \"after failing to reach agreement with him on certain matters\". On the same day, Hollinger announced it was embarking on a strategic review that could see the group or its assets sold. Lord Black is battling to retain control of his empire after he was forced to step down as chief executive of Hollinger International when the unauthorised payments were uncovered by a board special committee. The Canadian-born peer, who is famed for an opulent lifestyle including private jets and homes in New York, Florida and London, is under intense scrutiny with US and Canadian financial watchdogs investigating the irregularities. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
