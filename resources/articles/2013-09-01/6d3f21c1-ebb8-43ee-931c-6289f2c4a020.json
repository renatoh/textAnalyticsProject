The 52-year-old, who was heard being ordered to \"get back on board\" the stricken Costa Concordia by an incredulous coastguard on the night of the disaster, spent the day of the parbuckling with his lawyers in his home in Meta di Sorrento, near Naples, the Ansa news agency reported. Five employees of the company Costa Cruises have already been convicted of multiple manslaughter and negligence, and Schettino is in the middle of his own trial on charges including multiple manslaughter and causing a shipwreck. It began in July in a theatre in the town of Grosseto \u2013 the unusual space was needed to accommodate the hundreds of witnesses, lawyers and journalists expected to be present at the hearings. Schettino denies the charges, arguing that more than one person was to blame for what went wrong that night and that he has been made a convenient scapegoat for the tragedy given that within days of the disaster he had already been christened \"Captain Coward\" by the world's media. He says his manoeuvrings in response to the crash in fact saved lives. Schettino is expected back in court \u2013 and in the spotlight\u2013 next Monday on 23 September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
