The assessment and qualification alliance exam board said the cost of replacing the English and English literature papers was expected to be about \u00a3250,000, although a spokesman, George Turnball, said the true cost could not be estimated because of the logistical complications in reprinting and distributing new papers to 3,000 schools. West Midlands police are investigating the theft and Parcelforce is conducting an internal inquiry. Mr Turnball said the board first heard of the incident when papers were discovered by a member of the public behind a derelict pub near to where a theft from a Parcelforce van had been reported. It is not clear if the thieves had been specifically looking for the papers. The board assured students they would not be affected by the theft. Replacement papers would be in schools and colleges in time for the examinations on May 21 and June 5. Kathleen Tattersall, chief executive of the AQA, said: \"There is no room for compromise when the integrity of our examinations is threatened. We have taken decisive and prompt action to replace the suspect papers, and to inform schools and colleges of the action we are taking. We are grateful to them for the part they will play in ensuring that all suspect papers are replaced and that the integrity of these examinations is preserved.\" The exams watchdog, the qualification and curriculum authority, said: \"This was a serious theft involving this summer's AQA English language and literature GCSE examination papers. New papers have been printed and will be distributed to the schools in advance of the exams.\" \"AQA contacted us immediately following the theft. QCA are satisfied that the correct course of action was taken to safeguard the interests of students. This incident is the result of a crime, which is now being investigated by the West Midlands police.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
