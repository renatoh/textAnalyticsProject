Though that proved premature, there seems no doubt the Republic of Ireland manager will be heading for the Premiership. Admitting that he misses club management, McCarthy has revealed that Euro 2004 will be his final campaign with the Republic. Whether McCarthy reaches the end of that road remains to be seen. He never openly touted himself for the Sunderland job but his biographer and friend Cathal Dervan only just stopped short of suggesting McCarthy would have swum across the Irish Sea and run to the Stadium of Light. The feeling in Ireland is that their manager will depart given the right offer. It would be hard to blame McCarthy for going. Despite his success he has been harshly criticised by sections of the Irish media and the vitriol has intensified since he sent Roy Keane home from the World Cup and lost the opening Euro 2004 qualifier 4-2 in Russia. The Keane issue will not disappear - \"a negative influence around the squad,\" says the manager - and the perception that McCarthy wants out will further fuel his critics. As the former defender prepares for his latest must-win match, at home to Switzerland on Wednesday, the one certainty is that he will not extend his contract. \"I'd like to qualify for the European Championship and then I will have done eight years in the job and I think that's more than enough,\" he says. \"I will go away from it, whatever happens. Even if we qualify I will go and look for a job.\" And managing in the Premiership appeals? \"Yes, I'd like to.\" McCarthy has never coached in the top flight. His only managerial stint before Ireland was at Millwall, one tier below. After rejuvenating them but losing in the play-offs, he left in 1996 with the team heading for relegation. Though McCarthy insists he \"loves\" his current work, a return to the club scene appeals. McCarthy, speaking before he became a leading candidate for the Sunderland job, says: \"I miss that day-to-day stuff. I've got more used to doing this job and the time it affords you but I would still like to manage in the Premiership. I'll manage a football club but the kick is the team. That's what drives us all on, I imagine. It certainly drives me: the football matches. \"You can have more of an influence on the players, certainly [at a club]. On the pitch, I'm talking about. That is what we all like doing best. That is the best part of the job. Training with the players, doing coaching sessions, not all the other stuff that goes with it. Training day-to-day and the matches.\" McCarthy had plenty of \"other stuff\" to deal with during a traumatic but ultimately heroic World Cup in which Ireland lost on penalties to Spain in the second round. A read of his World Cup diary, being published next week, suggests he had no option other than to expel Keane. Yet McCarthy will never win an Irish popularity contest with his former captain and it surprised many that he did not quit after the World Cup. The 43-year-old knows the Keane incident will always dog him, and last summer seemed a natural end-point and a chance for him to pursue his Premiership ambitions. \"At the time, not while we were playing but afterwards, I considered it,\" he says. \"But then I considered qualifying for the European Championship and I thought, with the team we've got and the way we've played, why should I walk away? I think I might have been walking away to suit other people, not to suit me. I love doing this job and to qualify for Portugal in 2004 was my ambition. \"I could have walked away and everyone would have had just good memories about the team in World Cup 2002. But that's a bit easy isn't it, just walking away from it all? I wanted to carry on and do it. Then you come back and there are 100,000 people in Phoenix Park and I have a great young team who performed well in the World Cup. \"What do you do? Just say 'That's me finished, I'm walking away and I'll wait until somebody gets the sack and I get offered a job in the Premiership'? That's effectively what I would have been doing. But it's wrong to say that's why I stayed on. I wasn't going anywhere. It's my job and I want to continue.\" McCarthy believes that, with youngsters such as Damien Duff and Robbie Keane, his team are coming into their prime. A press campaign to oust him is gaining momentum, though. Despite suffering only three competitive defeats in three years, widespread scepticism remains. There have been calls for Roy Keane's return and the feeling in Ireland that he might come back if McCarthy goes is not helping the manager. A reconciliation between McCarthy and Keane is unthinkable - \"It's not going to happen,\" says McCarthy, \"he knows that and I know that\" - but the debate rumbles on. \"There's an underlying thing with Roy and whether he'll play that's still being churned up,\" says McCarthy. \"That's a bit of a negative influence around the squad. \"I think before the Russia game some of the lads said that, before every question, Roy was mentioned or something about what went on was mentioned [and it went] 'How do you think you're going to play without Roy?' While that remains it doesn't do us any favours but that's the way it is, I'm afraid. \"I'm not going to suggest that anything to do with the performance [in Moscow] was down to that. But I also know that when you are preparing yourself as a player, you don't want to be answering questions about that.\" It seems bizarre that McCarthy could be expected to offer an olive branch to Keane after the midfielder's foul-mouthed tirade in Saipan and his subsequent comment that McCarthy could \"rot in hell\". Certainly the manager has no regrets about the way he handled matters. \"If I could go back and change things and make it all right, I would,\" he says. \"But if I could go back in time and things were going to happen the same again, I wouldn't do it differently. Everything that was done, was done with the best intentions. It wasn't what I wanted to happen - the circumstances between Roy and myself - and it wasn't planned, for heaven's sake. To have one of the world's best players playing for us was what I wanted.\" The impact of the affair on McCarthy, his wife and children should not be overlooked. \"It has changed me, I'm sure,\" he says. \"What I went through in those two weeks has made me capable of dealing with anything, I would have thought.\" Of his book, agreed in advance, he says: \"If it hadn't have been planned and contracted to do, I wouldn't have done it.\" In two years, possibly sooner, there will surely be a Premiership chapter to write. \u00b7 Ireland's World Cup 2002, by Mick McCarthy and Cathal Dervan, published on October 21 by TownHouse (\u00a314.99)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
