The dominant sound is not the acoustic guitar, but the throb of synthesised kick drum that propels most of it gently towards the dancefloor. When he does turn to the acoustic, Yuill supplements it with percussion and synths (Sing Me a Song), or the unexpected organ that jolts the listener on Foreign Shore. And when he puts folk and dance together, as on close Taller Son, it's treat. Yuill's one weakness is his unexceptional voice, but he has an ability to create melting melodies \u2013 at times there's a purity that recalls Vince Clarke's songs for Depeche Mode and Yazoo \u2013 with enough melancholy to suggest hidden depths. A pleasure indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
