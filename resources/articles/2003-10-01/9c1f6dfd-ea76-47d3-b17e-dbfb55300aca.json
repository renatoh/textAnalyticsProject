But then that increasingly appears to be Portsmouth's purpose. Harry Redknapp, a manager unwanted in the Premiership, hired an assistant in Jim Smith, 63 last Friday, considered too old to be useful and assembled a team largely composed of other rejects. Now they tour the land, taking delight in thumbing their noses at those who lost belief in them. Houllier's humiliation came not only in the fact that Patrik Berger, a man he considered unworthy of a place in his squad, scored the only goal of the game, but in the manner in which his side were beaten. Not for a single minute did Liverpool appear superior to their opponents on any level, be it physically, mentally, tactically or technically. Afterwards he was the model of disingenuousness. \"What I liked about them was their hunger and desire,\" he said of Portsmouth. \"They have probably less talent than we have but they showed a great attitude.\" The assessment of Houllier's new captain Steven Gerrard was considerably more accurate. \"We weren't good enough, it's as simple as that,\" he said. Liverpool's mid-table position this morning reflects not misfortune but mediocrity. For much of the game it did not appear they had received any coaching at all. During the second half every player who likes attacking stood in attack, while all those who do not positioned themselves in defence. In between Portsmouth merrily intercepted their way to the points. Somehow Houllier, despite his failures, appears secure in his managerial position. Already Liverpool are working on a list of summer transfer targets supplied by their manager, implying that he will be at Anfield not only for the remainder of this season but for the start of next. But the main reason why he needs time to improve his team is that it has done nothing but deteriorate since the cup treble of 2001. The glow of superiority which Liverpool teams once possessed has been lost. Tellingly Redknapp rates a win over the Reds less highly than a draw against Arsenal. \"When you go to Highbury you don't expect anything,\" he explained. \"I felt if we set about it and played as we could play, I felt we could win, I really did. I came here confident that there was a big chance we could win.\" Admittedly Liverpool have a recent history of slipping up against even unimpressive Premiership sides - including the two worst, Sunderland last season and Watford in 1999-2000. But to characterise this match as a triumph of guts over guile, as those last two defeats were, would be to do Portsmouth a major disservice. For the visitors it was much worse than that. Always unhappy without Michael Owen, whose injury will keep him out for at least another week, Liverpool needed a positive start. They almost got it, Emile Heskey hitting the post in the first minute. Instead it was Berger who scored the early goal, from S\u00e9bastien Schemmel's low centre. Liverpool had already missed their best chance. As Houllier bemoaned the fact that his players \"lacked a bit of freshness\" after their midweek exertions in Europe, the player who did most to undo them had been out of training for most of the week with a back problem. After intensive work with a chiropractor he passed a lunchtime fitness test and proceeded to dominate the game with a combination of technique and tenacity. \"No one could have done more than Stoney today,\" said Redknapp. \"He's so fit it's frightening.\" Stone, a free-transfer signing from Aston Villa last Christmas, admits that the lingering pain of that rejection does much to inspire him. \"I suppose everybody here's got something to prove,\" he said. \"If you don't play for a team you're involved with for more than about six months, you're written off as being no good any more. That's it, you're finished. You're quickly forgotten about in football. But you've got to prove that you can still do it, not just over a couple of games but over a season. That's what I'm trying to do.\" It seems that the experience of rejection can do much to improve a player. Houllier should be given the chance to prove that the same applies to managers. Kevin McCarra's Player of the Weekend: Steve Stone (Portsmouth) The midfielder was the epitome of Portsmouth's over-achieving performance. Stone's days in the top-flight were supposed to be long behind him, but here he was not only confounding the injury problems that should have ruled him out but also surpassing everyone else with his energy and precision of passing as Liverpool were beaten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
