Speaking in a Channel 4 News interview, the prime minister also paid tribute to the generosity of the British public in the aftermath of what he had earlier described as the \"global catastrophe\" in south Asia. Asked whether he felt he should have cut short his holiday, Mr Blair said he had been in regular contact with officials in London since the tsunami struck on Sunday. \"I've been in touch at first daily, practically hourly actually, with what has happened ... I think the main thing ... is first of all to make sure we have the right response mechanism in place to deal both with the problem of British nationals that have been caught up in the tragedy, but also to deal with the humanitarian assistance,\" he said. \"I'm very satisfied with the work that's being done and ... have been actively involved in the meetings concerned with it.\" Congratulating his cabinet colleagues on \"a magnificent job\", the prime minister said Britain was \"at the forefront of the humanitarian assistance\" with its \u00a350m donation to the relief effort. \"I think it is really action in this respect, not words, that matter. There are things that call for immediate statements to be made. I think what is most important here is to make sure that we have the immediate action in place.\" However, he added that he would soon be concentrating on \"the medium and long-term consequences\" of the tsunami. 'UN should take the lead' Mr Blair dismissed the suggestion that the aid operation being coordinated by the US risked undermining the efforts of the UN. \"Well, I think there's some misunderstanding about this,\" he said. \"I don't think the Americans ever anticipated this as somehow displacing the UN. When I spoke to President Bush a short time ago, he made it very clear that he wanted the UN to be in the lead and that he sees the contact group and the work that the US is doing as very much supportive of that. \"There have been issues about whether the G8 should take the lead on it, should it be the contact group, you've got all sorts of different forums and international bodies. My view, very clearly from the very beginning, has been that the UN should take the lead on this - that is the proper clearing house.\" Mr Blair was asked whether he was confident that the UN had the capacity to take on the lead role, and whether the G8 group of major industrialised countries might not provide a more effective lead. \"The countries that are most affected by this aren't actually members of the G8 or members of the European Union, so I think there is a common sense in making sure that the UN is the body,\" he said. \"Now there are issues to do with capability - that's what I've been discussing with Kofi Annan [the UN secretary general]. We stand ready to help, so do the other countries in boosting that capability where it's needed.\" Britons' 'extraordinary generosity' Mr Blair paid tribute to the British public, saying: \"The British people have been extraordinary in their generosity. And I think those contributions alone from Britain look like they will total around \u00a350m,\" he said. \"Now, how do you spend that money? That is where you need a central clearing house, which I think should be the UN. That then is able to say we need this amount of money to go there, we've got this request from this government here, and this is the right way to deal with it.\" The prime minister said the response by western nations might have to be much bigger still. \"It will be - but I think here again what is important is that we listen to countries that are affected ... I mean, these are big independent sovereign nations like Indonesia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka. \"Now they are going to want to make their own assessment, and then come to us. That's why I don't think we should rush to a particular stipulated way of dealing with this now, but actually get the feedback from them of what they think they're actually going to need and how we can help in that. \"But the generosity of the British people has been absolutely extraordinary and remarkable, and a tribute to them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
