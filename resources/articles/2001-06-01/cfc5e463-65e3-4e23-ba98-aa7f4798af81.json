Where does the border between ethical and execrable lie? It is all a matter of individual perception. Some will be relaxed about alcohol but outraged over road building or the refusal to recognise unions. A number want companies to pull out of developing world manufacturing and bring the work home. Others say these jobs are essential to growing economies, providing minimum standards are followed. Some favour engagement to improve companies, others want to avoid all firms that transgress or sell existing shares in companies without principles.
