Despite concerns over the travel chaos caused by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud, articulated by both clubs to European football's governing body, Uefa refused to delay the ties. Liverpool face an arduous journey to the Spanish capital, although not as gruelling as initially feared. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's squad will travel by train from Merseyside to London this afternoon and then take the Eurostar to Paris, where they will stay overnight. Tomorrow morning Liverpool will take a train to Bordeaux, before a short flight to Madrid. A decision has not been made on the return trip and Liverpool hope the gradual reopening of UK airspace will allow for a flight home. \u2022 Fulham to take coach to tie in Hamburg \u2022 Ben\u00edtez impressed by Ngog in win over West Ham \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 3-0 West Ham Ben\u00edtez said: \"People are working hard to prepare a Plan A and Plan B. There are not too many options on the date. I don't like to play Mondays but hopefully everyone will be fresh and it won't be a problem. I don't think it will give Atl\u00e9tico an advantage for the game because we should be there in enough time to rest.\" There is a slight chance that the relaxation of the no-fly zones will enable Liverpool to fly to Madrid from Stansted airport as planned, although a decision will not be taken until this afternoon. Despite the uncertainty over their return from Spain, Liverpool accept they must fulfil their Premier League fixture at Burnley on Sunday. There is also no suggestion that Fulham's league game at Everton on the same day will be postponed and the club remains in the dark over whether supporters' flights to Hamburg will depart as scheduled. Fernando Torres, meanwhile, is optimistic he will be fit for the World Cup and has been reassured of his place in Spain's squad by the national team's sporting director, Fernando Hierro. The Liverpool striker will miss a reunion with former club Atl\u00e9tico and the rest of the domestic season with a knee injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
