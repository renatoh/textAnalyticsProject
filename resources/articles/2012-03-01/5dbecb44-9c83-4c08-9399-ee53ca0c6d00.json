In an appearance at the Guardian's Open Weekend, the former foreign secretary said the chancellor has joined forces with other centre-right European leaders to embrace a \"pre-Keynesian economic theory\". But Miliband said that it was wrong for the centre-left, which runs just three of the EU's 27 member states, to blame the bond markets for their failure to win elections. \"The temptation in politics is either to blame the voters or to blame bond markets,\" he said. \"Actually we politicians on the centre-left have got to look at why we are losing elections.\" Miliband launched his attack on Osborne when he was asked by the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland whether the chancellor was wrong in his deficit reduction plan \u2013 the elimination of the structural deficit by 2016-17. The former foreign secretary replied: \"Yes he is. If he said I don't care about the deficit and we are never going to repay our debts of course he'd have trouble in the bond markets. But that is not the issue. The issue is to move from a deficit reduction plan to a masochistic strangulation strategy which is what he has done. When you strangle the body economic then surprise surprise it loses blood and stops twitching. We are at 0.8% growth in this country as a result of a masochistic economic strategy. That is a political decision.\" Miliband attacked the coalition for arguing, in the wake of the 2010 election, in favour of an accelerated deficit reduction plan on the grounds that Britain was in danger of following the example of Greece. Osborne announced his plan in June 2010 to eliminate the structural deficit on a rolling five year judgment \u2013 he extended it by a year last November \u2013 on the grounds that credit rating agencies were in danger of downgrading Britain. Miliband endorsed Alistair Darling's plans to halve the deficit over four years. The former foreign secretary dismissed Osborne's comparison with Greece. \"Remember on the Greece point: Britain would become Greece if we don't have the Tory strategy,\" he said, mocking the chancellor. \"First of all, Greek debt is two to three times British levels. British debt is covered by our own deficit, it is covered by our own borrowing at current levels. The maturity of our bonds is 12 to 14 years, in Greece it is 12 to 14 weeks maximum and sometimes 12 to 14 days. So we are not in a Greek situation. It is a bit of politics that is being used.\" Miliband said that centre-right leaders had made a conscious political decision to impose austerity. \"The collective austerity that has been imposed across Europe is a political decision \u2026 this is a very dominant centre-right in Europe: 24 of 27 European countries from the centre-right embracing a pre-Keynesian economic theory and using the threat of debt default as the argument for every country to pursue austerity at the same time.\" But Miliband said the centre-left in Europe has to face up to its own failings. \"What has happened around Europe is the dominance of the centre-right and, let's be honest about it, the weakness of the centre-left. The weakness of the centre-left is part of this story, I would say a bigger part of the story than just the sort demonisation of the bond traders. The temptation in politics is either to blame the voters or to blame bond markets. Actually we politicians on the centre left have got to look at why we are losing elections.\" Miliband said that this week's budget, in which the chancellor announced the scrapping of the 50p top rate of income tax, had shown there were major differences between Labour and the Tories. \"Anyone who had any doubts about the difference between Labour and the Tories had their answer last Wednesday during the budget. The idea there is no difference between Labour and the Tories and that politics does not make a difference was comprehensively disproved by what the chancellor did on Wednesday.\" Miliband's strong attack on Osborne will be welcomed by Labour members who thought that he may have had some sympathy for the government's tough deficit reduction plan. In his draft acceptance speech, which he would have delivered if he had won the Labour leadership in 2010, he was planning to say that the party's greatest danger lay in underestimating the challenge of the deficit. The former foreign secretary planned to say that the deficit was \"the biggest argument in politics, and the biggest danger for us. George Osborne says we are in denial about the deficit. Because he wants us to be. So let's not be. It is a test\". The planned speech has been used by critics of David Miliband to say that he has either been overly sympathetic to the coalition or has aligned himself with those supporters of Tony Blair who have been critical of Ed Miliband for being too weak on the deficit. Some Blairites say Labour should acknowledge that it failed to rein in spending between 2005-08."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
