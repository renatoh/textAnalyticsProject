Graeme Smith, South Africa's record-breaking opening batsman and captain, revealed last night that Anderson's gesture in the opening passage of play inspired his monumental innings. And it will be in the back of his mind again today as South Africa, 412 for two, chase their record Test score of 622 for nine declared, made against Australia in Durban in 1970. And it might even inspire him to challenge Brian Lara's Test-record 375. Smith, unbeaten on 214 as South Africa look to build on their lead of 239, said: \"I can't remember what was said but it was a bit heated at the time. \"I didn't think it was right what Anderson did. He said he was throwing at the stumps. But at the time I didn't think he was near and I had a few words. \"A few of the England lads got on my back. It was heat-of-the-moment stuff. I was protecting Gary. I think it was wrong and I stuck up for him. \"I think each time something is said you really want to dig in and make him pay. At times it can work as an advantage to a batter. It made me more hungry. And I'm not finished yet.\" Smith, already with 576 runs in this series, added: \"A few of the England players said things to me. It was coming from left, right and centre. But we said a few apologies and were laughing and joking as we came off for lunch. I'm tired but chuffed. I'll take the tiredness any day for having achieved this. Centurian Gary Kirsten said: \"Graeme is doing some special stuff. But then we all knew he was destined for greatness when he first appeared on the scene. He has led superbly from the front. He's got three double centuries in a dozen Tests, including two in a row. \"He's really in the zone and he's not prepared to give it away. He's hungry for big runs, like a better example of Jacques Kallis. But partnerships mean even more to him than individual scores because this is a team game.\" Kirsten did offer England some comforting words. \"To be fair to them we have had the best of the wicket. The pitch settled down. There was some moisture early on, when they batted. But now there are some signs of uneven bounce.\" It is Duncan Fletcher, the England coach, who finds himself under the most pressure this morning. At no time in the past two days have England looked properly prepared to take on South Africa on level terms. And that's what Fletcher is for. If England lose heavily here, as they might, the entire strategy of protecting players from the county game may have to be reviewed. A number of players appear to be seriously undercooked. Fletcher looked a grim figure last night, when he said: \"The players aren't very happy after struggling over two days of cricket. But it's our job to make sure they're focused on playing some good cricket over the next three days. It's been tough for everyone out there. Some of the bowlers are inexperienced, and the batsmen too. \"We've been talking about where we want to bowl at Graeme Smith from before the first day of the first Test. But I thought we bowled better from about halfway through the second session today. \"But there are some youngsters who don't really appreciate bowling six balls in a row in the same area on a pitch like this. \"They have been brought up on wickets where they just bowl and something will happen to the ball. We've got to make sure that their mindset changes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
