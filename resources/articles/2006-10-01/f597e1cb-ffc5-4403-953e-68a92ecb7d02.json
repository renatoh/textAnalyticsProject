Governors do not have to win over an electorate, but their policies set a frame-work for many aspects of school life and can be ultimately judged by Ofsted. Annexe 3 of the Guide to Law for Governors lists 30 policies and other documents that governing bodies are required to have by law. For many schools, dealing with policy is a matter of annual or biennial review. The spadework can often be devolved to committee and then taken to a full governing body meeting for approval. This also gives a specific committee or group the responsibility for looking out for changes to that particular document. The workload can be spread further by ensuring that review is carried out on a one-, two- or three-year cycle so that all the work does not come at once. There is a wealth of local authority and education department guidance on policies. While many of these are excellent, I would strike one note of caution. Some of the material available on the internet is not up to date. The education department's own teachernet website, for example, provides a list of model policies that has not been upgraded since October 2005. Wokingham district council has one of the best lists of model policies online. These include designated roles of responsibility where appropriate. Schoolpolicy.co.uk encourages schools to submit their own model policies. The terms and conditions of the site say it aims to provide a platform for schools to share best practice. Governors have a legal obligation - and right - to set these rules and make sure the school abides by them. \u00b7 For more information see Annexe 3 of the 2006 Guide to Law, visit www.wokingham.gov.uk/children-youth-education/schoolszone/for-school-governors/model-school-policies and www.schoolpolicy.co.uk.
