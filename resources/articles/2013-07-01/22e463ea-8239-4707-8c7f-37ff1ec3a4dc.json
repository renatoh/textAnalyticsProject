What's Cooking is a social enterprise that works with young people in dynamic, creative spaces close to their homes and schools, using food and cooking as a means of engaging with them and developing new skills. We teach teenagers the skills they need to run a cafe \u2013 how to cook, prepare drinks, take orders and serve. There is also a real focus on meeting adults they wouldn't otherwise know or even meet. We've been working with this particular group of 15-16-year-olds from the City Academy in Hackney, London, for three weeks and, for the fourth session, they had a go at actually running the Russet cafe, in Hackney Downs. Six students took part: Kuran, Can, Nathan, Mariah, Eugenie and Thanbir. They invited friends and family, as well as teachers from their school. The Russet, a regular working cafe, was also open to the public \u2026 After three weeks of practice, the group were really ready to show their family, friends and teachers what they could do. There is real pressure to deliver everything on time. They had to get the cafe looking great, price everything up, organise the float, bake everything and make it look presentable \u2013 but they rose to the occasion brilliantly and ran a seriously professional cafe. It's hard to say how many people they served, but they made about \u00a380. What was on the menu? Apple cake, flapjacks, feta and roasted pepper savoury muffins as well as a few other cakes that Mariah had made at home: a chocolate cake with fudge ganache, rainbow cupcakes and a classic Victoria sponge. Mariah is a really excellent baker \u2013 she's been thinking about setting up her own cake-making business after school. Alongside the cakes, they served coffee and lots of green tea. How long did it take to prepare? The group arrived just after 1pm and we ate lunch together and chatted through plans for the afternoon: who was responsible for which recipes, who would prepare the food table, who was on drinks \u2026 We started cooking at around 1.40pm and the food was all ready for 3.15pm, before guests arrived from 3.30pm. The whole group had worked so hard that it was really important that people came. We all had pre-event jitters, so it was a real relief as people started to arrive and we all got stuck in to our different roles. During and after the event, every one of them looked so proud at what they'd achieved. We had half an hour once our customers had left to share thoughts about how everyone had played their part and each of them complimented another member of the team on their contribution. Savoury muffins The students tested all sorts of different ingredients \u2013 spinach, roasted peppers, sundried tomatoes, sunflower seeds, parmesan \u2013 before settling on this winning combination. Makes 16 350g flour 35g sugar 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp paprika \u00be tsp salt 90ml milk 125ml vegetable oil 2 large eggs 30g spinach, thinly sliced 180g feta, crumbled 60g roasted red peppers, chopped 200g parmesan, grated 1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, paprika and salt in a bowl. 2 Add the milk, oil and eggs to a separate bowl and mix well. Once combined, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and fold together. 3 Add the spinach, feta and peppers and fold to combine. 4 Divide the batter into muffin tins, sprinkle with parmesan and bake for around 25 minutes. Mariah's rainbow cupcakes Mariah made these cupcakes at home and brought them to the cafe to sell. Makes 12 125g unsalted butter 125g caster sugar 2 eggs 125g self-raising flour 1 tsp vanilla extract 3 tbsp milk Red, blue, yellow and green food colouring 1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cream together the sugar and butter until they have become pale and fluffy. 2 Beat the eggs in one at a time, adding a little flour after each egg. Continue adding until the ingredients are mixed. 3 Add the vanilla essence and mix. Then add the milk 1 tbsp at a time, mixing after each addition. 4 Divide the mixture into six bowls. In bowl one, add \u00bd cap of red food colouring; in bowl two, add \u00bd cap of red and \u00bd of yellow; in bowl three, add \u00bd cap of yellow; in bowl four, add \u00bd cap of green; in bowl five, add \u00bd cap of blue; in bowl six, add \u00bd cap of blue and \u00bd of red. Stir the colouring into each mixture after adding. 5 Divide the purple mixture between the 12 cases. Repeat with the other mixtures in this order: blue, green, yellow, orange, red. 6 Bake for around 10-15 minutes. Once they have cooled, decorate the cupcakes with your choice of sugar coating and sprinkles.
