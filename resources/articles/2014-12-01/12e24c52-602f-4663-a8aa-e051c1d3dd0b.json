The Times is instituting a round of 100 job cuts, led first by buyout offers. The deadline for the buyout offers was yesterday. Employees speculated about which of their colleagues would take early exit packages and which could be laid off. The job reductions, which will come first in the form of buyouts, appear likely to continue a generational shift at the paper as veteran reporters and columnists accept lucrative offers to leave. The newspaper announced its intention to reduce staff in October, when it said it would cut 100 jobs, or 7.5% of its 1,330 newsroom positions, in the coming months. The newspaper told its shareholders that the buyouts were the driving reason behind the company\u2019s $9m operating loss in the third quarter of this year, with an estimated cost of $21.4m in severance payments due to the staff reductions. Monday was the deadline for staffers to submit their applications for buyouts, which may be accepted or rejected by the paper\u2019s editorial management team. There is also a grace period of 10 days after Monday, during which staffers can reconsider their applications and pull them back. The buyout offers are only available to employees with more than five years of experience at the Times. The paper is also separately offering early exits for more than 20 of its commercial executives, including those in ad sales. Those who applied for the buyouts will know if their applications have been accepted by mid to late December. While the Times is unlikely ever to announce the names of those who have taken buyouts, according to a person familiar with the matter, speculation will be hard to tamp down in a place where journalistic curiosity is rampant. The goal is 100 job reductions. If the Times doesn\u2019t accept 100 buyout applications, it will make up the difference with layoffs. So far, the buyouts signal a continuing generational shift at the paper, with veteran reporters and columnists publicly announcing they have accepted the lucrative offers to leave. Of those who have publicly confirmed their departures, several have been at the paper for decades. Chief financial correspondent Floyd Norris, 67, already announced that he would take a buyout and plans to be \u201chappily retired\u201d from the paper as of 19 December. Television writer Bill Carter, who has been with the paper for 25 years, called the decision to take the buyout \u201cwrenching and agonizing,\u201d according to the Huffington Post. Ron Wertheimer, an editor on the Culture desk who has been at the Times since 1988, is also headed for the door. Brian Knowlton, the Washington-based editor for the International Herald Tribune and its successor, the International New York Times, since 1995, is also leaving. The seniority of the takers is no surprise, considering the lucrative packages, which step up in generosity according to years served. According to the Newspaper Guild, a union which represents most of the Times\u2019 editorial staff, \u201cemployees with 35 years of service would get twice their pay for 2013, an additional 35% of that figure, plus eight months of paid medical coverage.\u201d Similarly, employees with at least 20 years at the Times would get three weeks of pay for each year there, plus another 35%, along with the same medical coverage for eight months. As more senior editors and writers take the buyouts, however, it is sure to raise concerns within the paper about the newspaper\u2019s institutional memory and history, which is upheld by its senior staffers. In recent years the Times has lost several of its senior editors, particularly after a reconfiguring of the masthead under then-editor Jill Abramson in 2013. At the time, Abramson asked 30 of the paper\u2019s managers \u2013 who were not in the Newspaper Guild \u2013 to take buyout offers. The move resulted in the departures of several well-known editors, including Jon Landman, well known for his opposition to Jayson Blair, and now at Bloomberg, as well as metro editor Joe Sexton, who moved to ProPublica, and Jim Roberts, known for modernizing the Times\u2019 digital approach and now the executive editor of Mashable. Abramson herself was fired, controversially, this summer. Her departure spurred a wave of commentary including a Kindle Single by Barnard College president Deborah Spar, titled The Abramson Effect. At the same time, the Times has had to contend with the rise of the digital audience and its desires, which the paper has indicated requires new thinking. The Times announced a $9m loss in its most recent quarter, but added that digital advertising would rise 15% in October while print advertising would fall 10%. In October the paper announced it would shutter its NYT Opinion app, which failed to attract digital subscribers at the rate of $6 a month. Andy Rosenthal, editorial page editor of the New York Times, told reporters that the venture worked journalistically but not as a business. To oversee app launches, the Times last month hired Kinsey Wilson, from NPR, as its innovation and strategy officer to connect the newsroom and the commercial side of all digital products. The details on Brian Knowlton\u2019s title and years of service have been updated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
