In a move expected to raise tensions with Italy, the European commission paved the way for an initial fine of as much as \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a33.1bn) on Wednesday after advising the country had met the threshold for disciplinary action. The commission found the Italian government had failed to make sufficient progress in the past year to reduce its debt, the servicing of which amounted to more than the annual education budget. The commission\u2019s report said Italy was not expected to meet its debt reduction targets in 2019 or 2020, and an excessive deficit procedure \u2013 under which Italy could be forced to hand over 0.2% of its GDP as a deposit to guarantee remedial action \u2013 was warranted. \u201cItaly\u2019s large public debt is a major vulnerability for the Italian economy and decisively reducing it should remain a priority in the best interest of Italy,\u201d the commission said. \u201cItaly\u2019s public debt-to-GDP ratio, at 132.2% in 2018, is the second-largest in the union and one of the largest in the world.\u201d The report will now be put before member states and the EU\u2019s finance committee for input. It is unlikely a decision on sanctions will be made for many months. Beyond issuing a warning, the first financial sanction involves a \u201cnon-interest bearing deposit\u201d of up to 0.2% of gross domestic product, but the penalties could become steeper if the Italian coalition government fails to change its ways. Ahead of the publication of the commission\u2019s report, Italy\u2019s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League is in a coalition government with the Five Star Movement (M5S), said he would not let Brussels give instructions to Italy. \u201cWe are the second industrial power in Europe,\u201d Salvini tweeted. \u201cEach year, we give \u20ac6bn more than we receive. We don\u2019t need money from other countries, we\u2019re asking to use our money how we want to.\u201d Marco Zanni, the League\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, claimed the move was politically motivated. \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned about the procedure; we will work so that there is no longer a political use of EU economic rules,\u201d Zanni said. \u201cIf we look at the numbers and at who doesn\u2019t respect the rules, there are other states that preach to Italy and don\u2019t respect them.\u201d Despite Salvini\u2019s tough talk, the commission\u2019s review will be a destabilising factor for the Italian government. On Monday, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned his two deputies, Salvini and Luigi Di Maio from M5S, that he would resign if they continued to try to flout the EU\u2019s rules. Salvini, in response, signalled his determination to move forward with a plan to lower taxes. \u201cWe will do everything possible to stay within the established parameters, but if a child is hungry and in order to feed him parameters need to be rediscussed \u2026 my child comes first,\u201d he said. Under EU rules, no country should have a budget deficit larger than 3% of gross domestic product or debt above 60% of GDP. Italy\u2018s public debt was 132.2% of GDP in 2018 and is forecast to rise to 135%. The commission\u2019s vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said economic growth had additionally \u201ccome to almost a halt\u201d. He added: \u201cItaly pays as much in debt servicing as for the entire education system. In 2018, Italy\u2019s debt represented an average burden of \u20ac38,400 per inhabitant, and in addition, the average debt servicing cost was around \u20ac1,000.\u201d Dombrovskis said the commission was not opening the excessive debt procedure as EU member states had to express their views on the matter first."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
