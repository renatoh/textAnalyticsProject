Most will train you to do your job - you need that training before you can practise your career at any meaningful level. But with so much choice it's easy to close your eyes and veer towards a well-established, competitive programme and process in the hope that one size fits all. Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association for Graduate Recruiters, believes that finding what suits you is down to research. \"What distinguishes a good graduate programme is that it delivers what it promises,\" he says. \"The problem is that there's no way a final year undergraduate can really know which one will, except by reputation. During the selection process you need to ask the right questions. \"Is this an all-in training programme which will give you transferable skills for the future? Is it one which emphasises personal and career development as well as the skills you need for the job?\" The best programme for you, of course, depends on the kind of career you're interested in pursuing - and you need to be aware that your first career step is unlikely to be a job for life. \"AGR members are obsessed with retention but are more reluctant to reveal individual figures,\" says Carl. \"When we surveyed members anonymously two years ago, the best said they still had 80% of their graduate intake after five years; the worst said they had lost 80% within five years. There is obviously a link between how long people stay and how long the training is, but retention is certainly something you could raise at interview. Ask too what support is on offer beyond the initial training period.\" Trying to compare graduate training schemes is preposterous in an apples-and-pears kind of way. But in our very humble opinion, we think the following are eight of the best: Clifford Chance Why single out this law firm for plaudits when there are hundreds of firms offering training contracts to budding solicitors? Like the company, Clifford Chance's programme is big, well-established, international and offers opportunities in many areas of law. If you're looking for a more intimate and personal training contract or don't like the idea of business law, it won't be for you, but it's nevertheless a strong example of good practice. Clifford Chance will pay your fees through law school and give you a living allowance ahead of a two-year training contract which requires you to complete four six-month placements or 'seats' in different areas of the law, one of which can be abroad if you wish. Technical training will continue after qualification through its 'academy' programme and, after three or four years, you attend a lawyer's development centre (LDC), an off-site residential course aimed at assessing your strengths and weaknesses with a view to implementing a personal development plan over the next 18-24 months. Last year nearly 95% of trainees stayed with the firm on qualification. Deloitte &amp; Touche There was a time when wannabe trainee accountants would laud the opportunities offered by Arthur Andersen. Their pitch was simple: we'll pay you more, you'll get better training and you'll make partner younger (some at barely 30-years-old). Post-Enron, Andersen has been subsumed into Deloitte &amp; Touche, another vast international player, and so this year perhaps the title of hottest graduate accountancy programme should pass to them. In truth, any of the remaining three of the 'Big Four' (PwC, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG) will also pay you well to train and take exams at their expense. Three years down the road - and providing you pass them all - you are employable for life. These exams are tough and accountancy can be dull. But it's a fabulous foundation from which you can build your future career. MI5 Difficult to judge job satisfaction on this one: after all, applicants aren't supposed to mention what they are and Spooks gave the impression the security service was all about deep fat fryers and exploding girlfriends. Still, here's a two-year programme that offers intensive skills training, supported learning in the work place and progress reviews - as well as a unique chance to investigate and counter the various threats to national security. Teach First There's no way to know if this brand new scheme will deliver what it promises - the first intake of 200 starts next September. But this unique business-led programme for top graduates, which combines two years paid teaching in challenging London secondary schools with cutting-edge education and management training from highly-respected institutions in the UK, looks a winner. Participants receive structured networking and mentoring opportunities with executives from some of the world's most prestigious companies and organisations. And you get to keep your options open while making a difference. A McKinsey report shows that great teachers can improve pupils' results by 40%. Expect to be challenged and inspired. Mars.com | Unilever | Proctor and Gamble It was a source of great amusement to me as an undergraduate that so many of my peers arrived at college wanting to change the world and left feeling they'd failed if they hadn't landed a job selling soap powder or chocolate. A place on the programmes at Unilever, Mars or Procter &amp; Gamble remains highly coveted and they now embrace the human resources, IT, finance, engineering and R&amp;D functions. But it's those sales and marketing roles that people hanker after. These schemes give you a fabulous introduction to the Fast Moving Consumer Goods market. They're better paid, more commercial and offer more structured training than advertising and give you insight and experience which you can transfer to management consultancy or independent enterprise. WPP This world-leading communications group encompassing 90 companies offers three-year 'fellowships' which could see you working for brands including J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy and Mather or Hill &amp; Knowlton. This programme is like doing a practical PhD in marketing - advertising, media investment, information consultancy, branding, health care and specialist communications could all form part of your experience. There are graduate opportunities to be both creative and logical and WPP likens the disciplinary rotation to the experiences offered by many leading management consultancy firms. You could work abroad and you're also given a personal mentor in your first year. Bain &amp; Company If you're interested in top-flight strategic consultancy and have the academic record to make it worth applying, check out Bain. It offers fabulous practical business experience and the opportunity to learn how to make businesses more valuable. Clients could include private equity, venture capital, community projects and internal management - there's real diversity and an emphasis on learning. Join as an associate consultant and you'll get two weeks' induction in your local office, then 10 days in Cape Cod learning with colleagues around the world. This is followed up with annual training in, say, Mexico. A scheme with a great reputation which gives you access to an awesome network of alumni. National Graduate Development Programme for Local Government The public sector remains recession-free and has finally woken up to the need to attract graduate talent to its ranks through a structured two-year programme. Projects are based within three key areas - strategy, front-line service and support service. The mix of placement activities will vary with every authority depending on their needs and their interpretation of the programme. The strategy placement will be research-based or may involve policy formulation include activities that may have an effect on the organisation as a whole. The front-line service placement will consist of direct involvement with the public through a service such as housing, environmental health or social work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
