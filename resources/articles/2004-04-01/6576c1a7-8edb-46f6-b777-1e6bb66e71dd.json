Eat, drink, bank, insure, travel and die with it. The Co-op Group is a cloth-cap Tesco, retailer of many things to most people, albeit considerably smaller, with an annual income of \u00a38.1 billion compared with the \u00a326.9bn Tesco earns in Britain. Martin Beaumont, chief executive of the Co-op Group, was able, however, to unveil a respectable set of figures the day after his better-known counterpart, Sir Terry Leahy, wowed the nation with his \u00a355-a-second statistic. Beaumont, who arrived at the end of 2002, had his own headline-grabber. For the first time since the 1970s the Co-op, which is mutually owned, will pay customer members a dividend from its profits - a symbolic \u00a310 in year one with the promise of more thereafter. 'We are a consumer-facing organisation now, in complete contrast to our historic roots. If [one of our] businesses is not consumer-facing then it has to underpin our consumer-facing activities in a way that we think is positive.' There speaks a management accountant by training. Beaumont started out at what is now KPMG. Figures he presented a year ago showed a pre-tax loss of \u00a3112.5 million, due mostly to investments made by the Co-operative Insurance Society. Today pre-tax profit is \u00a3385.4m and the key food business is doing well, with profits up by 66 per cent since the acquisition of convenience store chains Alldays and Balfours. Beaumont has overseen a review of the group and has put the milk processing business up for sale, subject to the usual caveat about only selling if the price is right. Before he took the chief executive post he ran the Co-op's biggest member organisation, United Co-operative, and says he believes wholeheartedly in the values that distinguish the group from its rivals. But he also believes that a business that makes no money will also fail to promote its mission. He grimaces when asked about the political history of the Co-op. 'We do not want to be seen as overtly political because we are not political. We do, however, see a very strong, virtuous circle. Strong commercial success enables us to fulfil our social goals and that in turn provides us with a competitive distinction which then drives our commercial success.' In the past the social values did not always equate with success. Until recently a trip to the local Co-op could be a depressing experience, as Beaumont tacitly admits. 'We are the biggest farmer in the country and now the farming business is producing what the retail side wants, rather than growing produce and delivering it.' Now its stores lead the field in adopting fair-trade products, combating GM (including lobbying the Government) and promoting organic and locally sourced food. The Co-operative Group was first into the race to grab chunks of convenience stores when it bought Alldays in 2002. Convenience stores - the new name for corner shops - make up the only sector of the British food market that is growing. More shoppers look to local stores to top up on their big weekly supermarket trip and social changes, such as the growth of single households, have also had an impact. Food sales on a like-for-like basis within the Co-op's c-store brand, Welcome, were up by 3.4 per cent last year which, although respectable, shows just what an impact the acquisitions have had. 'Others have seen what the opportunities are because of what we have done and followed us. We have publicly expressed an interest in smaller supermarkets that might become available.' That is an oblique reference to the tail-end of the Safeway chain which Morrison's must sell to meet regulatory requirements. 'Obviously I cannot talk about anything that is subject to ongoing negotiations,' he adds when the Londis chain comes up. 'We are on the record as looking at other opportunities to buy convenience store chains.' Beaumont says at the other end of the store-size scale the Co-op is not doing so well. Rivals such as Tesco and Asda (turnover \u00a312bn) have pushed into non-food rapidly. The Co-op is limited by space but does have 40 department stores and 15 large supermarkets. Yet Beaumont is exiting the large format and is trying a new department store format in Perth which, reading between the lines, must perform superlatively to rescue that side of the business. The sense of excitement you might expect from a business that is lighter, brighter and in an aggressively acquisitive phase does not pour from Beaumont. He winces when asked about the most exciting part of the group. 'I could end up offending everybody.' Pushed, he says that the travel business is doing well. The Co-op bought two internet companies selling cheap flights and is the country's largest independent travel agency. And he highlights the return of the divi. At its peak the Co-op had 13 million members in the 1960s. Now it has about 13 million customers but only 1m of those are members. The promise of a twice-yearly divi may entice some to pay their \u00a31 and sign up to the principles of the Co-op. Beaumont thinks carefully before he speaks. Given the Co-op's structure - every decision must be approved by a non-executive board of 28 elected members - that is hardly surprising. 'It is an interesting cocktail. It makes my job [pause] interesting. If people think there is a lack of accountability because this is not a plc with shareholders then they are much mistaken.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
