So Frenchy So Chic (SFSC) is the annual celebration of all things French and this year\u2019s picnic in Bicentennial Park was as popular as ever. Held in both Sydney and Melbourne, this year marks the festival\u2019s first year in its new home on the foreshore of Rozelle Bay in Glebe. Until now, the Sydney SFSC has taken place on the lawns of St John\u2019s College, in the slim shadows of the University of Sydney\u2019s sandstone buildings. The park may be a little less romantic but it\u2019s spacious, there\u2019s much more shade and a cool breeze drifting off the water. And, as we arrive, the dreamy vocals of chanteuse Sophie Maurin drifting beyond the festival grounds sets the tone for the day. SFSC is arguably the best-dressed festival in town and the most Insta-ready. Floaty summer dresses and heels are de rigueur for the mostly female attendees, while the men wear loafers and tailored shorts. There aren\u2019t quite as many Breton T-shirts in evidence this year but still plenty of flower crowns, available for purchase from two stands. Not far from where we spread out our picnic blanket, a group of women in pale frocks are partaking in a very classy, very polite bachelorette party. The food on offer is, of course, excellent. There are crepes and moules, calamari and fries, croissants and macarons, and oodles of cheese, carefully selected from Sydney\u2019s top French restaurants. It\u2019s pricey but delicious, with plenty of Kronenbourg bierre blanc and Laurent-Perrier champagne being quaffed by the crowd. The festival excels at including the younger attendees. Those under 12 get in for free and there are numerous activities, including drumming, croquet and life-size chess, to keep them occupied. Small faces painted with sparkly butterflies weave through the crowd and toddlers and tweens chase bubbles across the lawn. Indeed it\u2019s a festival for all generations and there are plenty of grandparents keeping a watchful eye on those energetic kids, while parents sit back and sip champagne. Although SFSC is ostensibly a music festival, only a portion of the well-heeled crowd pays close attention to what\u2019s happening on stage. Those who do are rewarded by top-class French acts including the Breton singer-songwriter Bertrand Belin and garage pop band the Limi\u00f1anas. Nouvelle Vague is the pick of most of the French folk I know and the group, with its evolving line-up of singers, are SFSC alumni from its earliest days. They are best known for their covers of Joy Division\u2019s Love Will Tear Us Apart, Billy Idol\u2019s Dancing with Myself and Buzzcocks\u2019 Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn\u2019t Have), mostly with a signature bossa nova backbeat. Last year, they released a new album, I Could Be Happy, their first in six years, and for SFSC they mix in a smattering of their own songs and more obscure covers with the crowd favourites. The final act \u2013 and musical highlight \u2013 is Deluxe. The funky six piece started in 2007 busking on the streets of Aix-en-Provence and they take obvious delight in their Australian stage debut. Singer Elisa Poublan aka Liliboy, clad in a golden halter top, red tights and sequinned moustache skirt quickly has the crowd on its feet, shaking off the day\u2019s summery mellowness and jumping up and down on command. The other band members Kaya, Pietre, Kilo, Soubri and Pepe all join her at the front during the lengthy set, their energy contagious on the balmy night. Yet for all its dreaminess, by unfortunate coincidence, the Sydney SFSC is held on the same day as women\u2019s marches are held across the world to protest against the election of the US president, Donald Trump. It feels more than a little decadent to be enjoying our raclette and saucisson as the world beyond our fabulous fenced off picnic upholds that other great French tradition of taking to the streets in protest. Still, in a world confronted with a potentially terrifying future, this is a beguiling and very welcome fantasy world. \u2022 So Frenchy So Chic Sydney took place at Bicentennial Park, Glebe"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
