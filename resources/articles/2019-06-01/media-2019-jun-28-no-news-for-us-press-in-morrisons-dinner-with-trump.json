Reports said the US president had \u201clauded\u201d the closeness of the Australian-US alliance and \u201c\u2018lavished\u201d praise on the prime minister. It was true of course. Trump had said Morrison \u201chad a fantastic victory\u201d. But for the US press corps it was a non-event. In its official briefing note the journalists said: \u201cPool was briefly led into dining room where President Trump was meeting with Australian Prime Minister (Scott) Morrison. There was no news.\u201d \u2018Precious\u2019 ABC stories to disappear The ABC\u2019s biggest collection of digital stories from regional Australians, collated on ABC Open since 2010, will disappear from public view on Friday. The broadcaster sent emails to the 28,000 contributors to the site, saying they should download their content before the end of the month because ABC Open was closed. A decision by ABC management to remove the archive from public view has infuriated former ABC producers who worked on the regional project. They say the decision marks the destruction of a valuable social archive of 193,000 documentary and social history stories in text, photography, audio and video. Suzi Taylor, one of 50 Open producers who worked in regional centres on collaborations with the public, has written to the ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, and asked her to halt the move and find a way to preserve the legacy. \u201cWhile former ABC Open producers knew that ABC Open was set to close, we never expected this would mean that these precious stories would be essentially wiped from the public record,\u201d Taylor wrote to Buttrose. \u201cTo give you an idea of how important and groundbreaking ABC Open projects were, the national series Aftermath has come to be Australia\u2019s biggest collection of regional Australian stories documenting natural disasters and recovery (around 1,600 all up). This project is just one of the many vital national projects from ABC Open.\u201d But the ABC says the site is \u201caged\u201d and simply not functional any more and is largely being used for photography now. All user-generated photography has been moved to Instagram using #abcmyphoto and appears on ABC News online. \u201cThe ABC has identified a number of important and ground-breaking written and video projects that form part of ABC Open,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of these projects, such as Separated, a series on forced adoption, and Mother Tongue, have found new homes on ABC Life and ABC Australia and Indigenous YouTube channels.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Former ABC Radio National producer and documentary maker Gretchen Miller says the ABC owes a debt to the members of the public who told their stories for free. \u201cAnd you also need to honour the fact that these are snapshots in time of the way Australians live \u2013 it is a most remarkable archive and resource for our understanding of who we are and how we live, and what we think,\u201d Miller told Weekly Beast. \u201cSo-called \u2018ordinary Australians\u2019 are shown to be anything but in these projects. And now the ABC is going to make that inaccessible to the public, to historians, to social commentators \u2013 it\u2019s just going to wilfully throw it away? I think it\u2019s shameful, and I\u2019m sorry to have wasted the time of those who put such commitment into the projects I ran. It\u2019s a massive waste of social capital, goodwill and content.\u201d Bolt cutter There is at least one journalist at the Herald Sun who won\u2019t be receiving any extra cash no matter how many readers he converts into paying subscribers, and his name is Andrew Bolt. Bolt is one of the best-read columnists and bloggers in the country and his strong opinions generate a lot of traffic, as well as debate, to the News Corp tabloids. But the editors at the Herald Sun who crafted the bonus cash scheme wanted it to benefit everyday news and sport reporters, not highly paid columnists. There is a cut-off rate of pay beyond which you are ineligible for any of the bonuses. Weekly Beast has learned some of News Corp\u2019s local mastheads, which operate under the banner News Local, also offer staff rewards for encouraging readers to sign up with exclusive stories but the Herald Sun is the first major metropolitan masthead to launch a trial. Well-worn path In the fine tradition of ABC communications heads quitting to work for the government, the ABC\u2019s head of public affairs, Emma McDonald, has resigned to join new communications minister Paul Fletcher as an adviser. Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s former principal private secretary Sally Cray occupied the same job at Aunty between 2011 and 2013 before resigning to rejoin the former member for Wentworth in Canberra. McDonald has been at the broadcaster for just one year but has seen a lot of action in that time, including the sacking of one managing director and the resignation of a chairman shortly after that. McDonald, the daughter of former ABC chairman Donald McDonald, is a former lawyer with extensive experience in the media industry. Last shot Also signing off at Aunty, but after a considerably longer period of time, is legendary ABC Melbourne cameraman Vince Tucci, who retires this week. Tucci joined ABC News in 1978 at the age of 21 and has worked for 7.30 since 1992. 7.30 executive producer Justin Stevens said Tucci had been a great ambassador for the program \u201cin addition to his brilliant camera work and collegiality\u201d. Four Corners reporter Louise Milligan was among the staff to pay tribute to Tucci: \u201cVince Tucci is an utter gentleman and a consummate professional. Nothing is ever too much trouble. He never makes a fuss and just gets on with doing what he does best \u2013 beautiful pictures. Vince always makes the talent feel at ease \u2013 even in situations where we are filming very traumatic interviews.\u201d The business editor, Peter Ryan, said: \u201cOverwhelmingly Vince has nurtured and encouraged a generation of reporters to lift their game, and despite regular temptation he\u2019s made them look better than they are with skilled lighting, framing and the odd bit of hairspray for certain male reporters who used to have a lot of hair.\u201d A love letter to newspapers past The News Corp veteran Terry Sweetman has written his last column for the Courier Mail after an even longer innings of 55 years, 25 of which have seen him writing opinion for the Mail and the Sunday Mail. Sweetman, who has worked across nine mastheads and edited three of them, wrote movingly of the great change in the craft of journalism over the half a century he has had a byline. \u201cThey introduced me to a boozing, brawling, fecund, rambunctious, furiously competitive yet oddly fraternal and tribal world inhabited by saints and sinners and by men and women of enormous talent, courage and principle,\u201d Sweetman wrote in his farewell column. \u201cNow, I find it a more homogenous world, the proud nails hammered flat by the conformity of diplomas and degrees, the spontaneity ground down by modern management theories, and the craziness subdued by the demands of multitasking and the appetite for 24-hour news.\u201d Gleeson\u2019s gleeful Logies campaign It\u2019s not an uncommon view to regard the TV Week Logie awards as \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. But when a nominee for the Logies top gong \u2013 the coveted Gold Logie for most popular TV star \u2013 disparages TV\u2019s night of nights it gets a tad awkward. The comedian Tom Gleeson, himself a Gold Logie nominee this year, has been mercilessly mocking the Logies and his fellow nominees in a series of faux attack ads posted on social media posts and in interviews. Because of the popular vote for Gold, each nominee is expected to campaign for public votes ahead of the live event on Sunday. But now Gleeson\u2019s obviously tongue-in-cheek statements appear to have provoked the 2018 Gold Logie winner, Grant Denyer, and Gold Logie nominee and comedian Amanda Keller. Gleeson and Keller are competing with ABC gardener Costa Georgiadis, actress Eve Morey, Sunrise weather man Sam Mac, actor Rodger Corser and The Project\u2019s Waleed Aly to take out the top prize. \u201cIt\u2019s become a joke this year,\u201d Denyer said on radio. \u201cTwo of the loudest Gold nominees are just effectively taking the piss.\u201d As well as Gleeson, Denyer is referring to Sam Mac who is driving across the country in a Sunrise bus emblazoned with logos like a politician touting for votes. \u201cTom Gleeson is just taking all the headlines,\u201d Denyer said. \u201cI\u2019m worried if he wins, that\u2019s it for the Logies forever.\u201d Surprisingly, Keller has also weighed in. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because Tom is playing a different game, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m finding I\u2019m struggling with to be honest,\u201d Keller told news.com.au. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that the nominees are a happy soup, and I still want us to be a happy soup, there\u2019s no need to make it personal and pick us all off. I know Tom\u2019s playing a comedic game, but really, I\u2019m just happy to be in the soup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
