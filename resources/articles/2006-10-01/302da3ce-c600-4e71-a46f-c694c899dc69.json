Investor fears of a collapse in player numbers and liquidity on PartyPoker.com were exacerbated by the group's decision to remove from the site a ticker advertising the number of virtual tables in use and the number of players online. Comparing Saturday night's poker traffic with a week earlier, Ivor Jones, of Panmure Gordon, said: \"Our very tentative estimate would be that rake and tournament fees would have been down more than 80% ... real money play appears to have picked up sharply at the poker sites which continue to operate in the US.\" PokerStars, the Israeli-owned group that has signalled its intention to continue in the US, has begun an aggressive recruitment campaign to capitalise on the exodus of rivals. In an almost unprecedented promotion, it is offering to double cash in new players' accounts when they sign up. If it has not done so already, the Isle of Man-licensed PokerStars is shortly expected to overtake PartyGaming as the the world's largest poker operator. A spokesman for PartyGaming, which until Friday generated three-quarters of revenues in the US, said the player and table number tickers had been removed because it did not want rival operators to use this information against it. \"We have taken the counters down temporarily. We are not going to give it on a plate to our competitors.\" He warned against extrapolating a longer trend from week-on-week comparisons on player numbers. The management is expected to give its view when PartyGaming reports its third-quarter numbers later this week. Julian Easthope, a UBS analyst, said: \"Liquidity drives revenues and Party will likely lose its market lead position.\" Retaining small players is vital to attract big-pot regulars. Operators typically generate 70% of revenues from just 30% of players. George Bush signed the Port Security Act into law on Friday. It bans unlicensed gambling, and bars banks and other payment specialists from facilitating betting. PartyGaming shares fell 4.5p yesterday to 30p - a quarter of the flotation price. Directors and founders have raised personal fortunes collectively worth \u00a31.2bn since the float. Yesterday, PartyGaming had a market capitalisation of \u00a31.2bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
