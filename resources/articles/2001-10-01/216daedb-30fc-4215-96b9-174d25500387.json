Less than one hour after both towers in New York had been hit - and just five minutes after the first collapsed - the special adviser to the secretary of state for transport, local government and the regions was urging senior colleagues to release any bad news as it was bound to be \"buried\". Jo Moore's controversial message comprised just one line: \"It's now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury. Councillors' expenses?\" At one level, the memo is naive. The truly manipulative would have used the telephone - not a traceable email. Even on an ordinary news day, councillors' expenses would not have made even an inch in most of the national press. But at another level, it indicates a horrendous obsession with news management. We know New Labour likes a good news story every day - not least to stop the media digging up bad news stories. Journalists always expect bad news on big news days - a Budget or a Queen's Speech. But media manipulation is not a new phenomenon, as the letter from a former Whitehall press officer notes. The letter provides a useful reminder - with the Tories calling for Ms Moore's head - that they did the same during the Dunblane shooting tragedy. Humbugs should keep quiet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
