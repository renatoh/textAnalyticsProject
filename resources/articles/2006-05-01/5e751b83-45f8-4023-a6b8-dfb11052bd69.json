I have to carry lots of books for my newly found serious pursuit (medicine), but is there anywhere that does stylish rucksacks?\" Sorry to be contrary, but I find rucksacks rather hot at the moment. This fits with our fondness for suits worn with a certain zip. There's not much more pleasing in the morning than seeing a city worker storming down the street in a well-fitting grey suit worn with big, white trainers and a rucksack on his back. Maybe it's about seeing your rucksack as a positive rather than a burden: don't buy one too big and regularly empty it, so you're not carrying a coal-sack equivalence of receipts, CDs, iPod wires and the like. I can tell from James's email address that he's at my old college in London - that means Slam City Skates in Covent Garden is local to him. I've often bought bags from their always-changing selection which they hang off the top of the spiral staircase leading to Rough Trade Records in the basement. When I was studying, I got them here by Shorty's. This week, the best one was the Navigator by Silas, for \u00a379.95. Shock horror: it's not a rucksack. If cycle couriers can cope with messenger bags, so can aspiring medics. Just make the strap short, so it's slung tight across your back. Before we go, a quick wedding tip. Our friend Luke was stuck for what to wear for a spring do in Ireland. His smart wardrobe basic: a black suit. Too funereal? Simple answer is a snazzy tie from Prada. Dark charcoal, with a line of small, silvery stars down the middle: \u00a375. It's a winner.
