Tom Wood and Dylan Hartley are also in line to return to the pack. Ford will definitely keep his place at fly-half having performed well against Samoa and Twelvetrees appears poised for a significant role at inside-centre after making a positive contribution as a second-half replacement for Farrell last Saturday. \u201cBilly Twelvetrees impressed me from the bench, he did well and brought good energy to the team,\u201d Stuart Lancaster said. \u201cHe\u2019s worked hard on the feedback we gave him when he came back into camp and he\u2019s a genuine prospect for us at 12.\u201d With the 21-year-old Ford having \u201cearned the right\u201d to play in the No10 shirt for a second successive week, it seems Farrell will have to be content with a place on the bench. There will definitely be no place in the matchday 23 for the Bath pair of Semesa Rokoduguni and Kyle Eastmond or the Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care, all of whom have been released back to their clubs to prepare for Friday\u2019s Premiership game between the sides. England remain hopeful Courtney Lawes will be fit despite hyper-extending a knee against Samoa. The Northampton lock will be unable to train until Thursday but Lancaster is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d he will make it. Billy Vunipola will not be involved after being concussed on Saturday, prompting Exeter\u2019s Thomas Waldrom to be summoned to the squad\u2019s training base in Bagshot as a precaution. Australia will be without their injured centre Tevita Kuridrani for the game, the last match between the countries before they meet in Pool A at next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. \u201cI\u2019m sure both sides, in the back of their minds, will have one eye on it but this Saturday it is all about this game,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cWhat happened last week or what happens next week is irrelevant. When the World Cup comes around in 10 months\u2019 time, both teams will be different. \u201cWe need to build on our performance against Samoa and learn the lessons from the previous two games. Any team coming to Twickenham for the last game of their series, after a long hard season, will be highly motivated, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Lancaster also welcomed the response of the Northampton flanker Tom Wood, who was left out in favour of James Haskell against Samoa. \u201cIt often helps selection when you give someone an opportunity and then you have someone as competitive as Tom who never likes missing one minute of training, never mind one minute of international rugby,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was definitely a reaction from Tom in training and when he came on against Samoa. A fired-up and motivated Tom Wood is a pretty useful weapon to have in your armoury.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
