In an article for the Times announcing the decision, the health secretary said it was clear Johnson was likely to win, and it was time to \u201cunite behind him\u201d as soon as possible. However, Hancock said Johnson, the former foreign secretary, had given assurances he would govern as a consensual, one-nation Conservative, and would support the needs of business. On both issues, Hancock said, he would \u201chold him to that\u201d. In the first round of voting among Tory MPs on Thursday, Hancock finished sixth out of 10 candidates with 20 supporters, above the 13 needed to progress to the next round but with little seeming chance of progressing much further. Hancock announced he was pulling out of the race on Friday morning. His endorsement for Johnson does not mean his former supporters will follow suit. On Monday, one of these, the Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton, said he would instead back the other self-styled moderniser in the race, Rory Stewart. Stewart was among five of the six remaining candidates who took part in a Channel 4 televised debate on Sunday night, which Johnson chose to not attend. Michael Gove, who had been hoping to receive Hancock\u2019s endorsement, said it was \u201cdisappointing, naturally\u201d, for it to go to Johnson, but insisted he remained a serious contender. \u201cAt the moment, yes of course it is the case that Boris is the frontrunner,\u201d the environment secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBut we need to make sure that he is tested, and we have two candidates who go forward, if Boris is one of them, who we know are being capable of being prime minister from day one.\u201d Gove added: \u201cI would be ready to take control of the ship of state and steer it safely through the difficult waters ahead.\u201d Asked about criticisms of Johnson\u2019s character and honesty, Gove was circumspect: \u201cThere have been various attempts to mount personal attacks against him and against some of the other candidates. I think that is wrong. In the past I\u2019ve had my criticisms and differences with Boris, but I believe that he is someone who is capable of being prime minister.\u201d In his Times article, Hancock said he had spoken to all the candidates, and had \u201creflected on what is needed in the national interest and how the approaches of the candidates fit with my values\u201d. He wrote: \u201cHaving considered all the options, I\u2019m backing Boris Johnson as the best candidate to unite the Conservative party, so we can deliver Brexit and then unite the country behind an open, ambitious, forward-looking agenda, delivered with the energy that gets stuff done.\u201d Johnson had run \u201ca disciplined campaign and is almost certainly going to be our next prime minister\u201d, Hancock argued, saying: \u201cWe need to unite behind him with a strong team that can bring the party together and then bring the country together.\u201d This unity, he said, needed to start \u201csooner rather than later\u201d. Johnson had promised in both public and private, Hancock added, to be a one-nation prime minister \u201cand bring the country together around an optimistic vision for the future\u201d. He said: \u201cI will hold him to that.\u201d Referring to their expletive-based jostling on business, Hancock said: \u201cBoris and I have both used language our mothers might disapprove of in this debate. But I have been reassured, again emphatically, that a Boris administration will be pro-business, pro-enterprise, supportive of the aspirational and the international. That matters to me, and I\u2019ll hold him to that too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
