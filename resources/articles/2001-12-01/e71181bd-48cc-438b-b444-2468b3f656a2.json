Countries such as Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey will also discuss the issue tomorrow at the executive committee meeting of Uefa, the European governing body, and plan to form a united front to lobby Fifa for an increase in match fees. Worries are rising among European nations in particular that all those taking part in Japan and South Korea will make a loss because of the relatively low money they will receive from world football's governing body. Next year's finals are set to be the costliest ever, for teams and fans, but they will also be the most profitable, with Fifa receiving record money from television and sponsorship. According to football insiders, no precise figures are available as yet on how much will be generated but Fifa stands to make \"several billion pounds\". Leading nations are concerned that most of this will not be used to help the 32 countries taking part, prompting fears that not only will participants suffer a huge financial loss but that Fifa will use the money to improve its financial standing. As things stand, each team taking part next year will receive \u00a3550,000 a match, a slight increase from France 1998 (\u00a3420,000). Fifa will also pay \u00a3400,000 to each country, an insignificant amount given living and travelling costs, particularly in Japan. England say that because those costs are much higher than in France, countries should receive a mimimum \u00a31m a match. Football Association officials are still calculating how much England's trip will cost but, said one senior FA source, it will be \"several million pounds\". The source, who has been lobbying European nations over the issue, said: \"The majority of the 32 nations taking part will make a loss unless the match fees are increased considerably. If you look at the fees that they gave us for France 98 then there's not a great deal of improvement.\" He added: \"Fifa has suffered losses, they have got financial constraints, but those countries taking part should not be made to pay for Fifa's losses. We are already lobbying hard within Europe to try and form a united front.\" Last week a report by the accountants KPMG found that Fifa suffered losses of about \u00a327m up to last June. Fifa has been blighted by financial problems after the collapse of its television marketing partner ISL, the cancellation of this year's World Club Championship, and troubles involving Traffic, the company appointed to sell television and marketing rights for the doomed tournament. The World Cup is Fifa's only profit-generating tournament and could provide the organisation with a vital route out of the current financial mess. A Fifa spokesman said: \"All the money will be used to fund Fifa's activities for the coming years. We can't give all the money away to the countries that are taking part in South Korea and Japan. We run a number of programmes and our money goes very quickly. \"We set an initial figure of 1.3m Swiss francs (\u00a3550,000) per match and that was the most we could afford. Clearly, some countries would like to see an increase . . . and that is something we will have to review.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
