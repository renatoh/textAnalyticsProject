The letter called for a large-scale national petition to be presented to the then minister of education (David Eccles) demanding more nursery schools and play facilities for under-fives. Belle received over 150 letters in response and collected nearly 4,000 signatures on her petition. Thus the Pre-school Playgroups Association was born. Those of us who were involved during the first 20-odd years are hoping to organise a reunion during the golden jubilee year to celebrate the pioneering days of this socially very significant movement.
