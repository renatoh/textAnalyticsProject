Replacing him is gaming veteran and current Zynga board member Frank Gibeau, the company announced on its blog. Pincus, an affable Silicon Valley character whose wealth is estimated at about $1bn, founded the company seven years ago and first resigned in April 2014 after a dramatic fall in the company\u2019s stock market value. He returned as CEO in April 2015, but this second stint only lasted less than a year. Zynga stock has fallen 85% from its 2012 high. Zynga\u2019s fortunes soared with the massively popular game Farmville, one of the first big social media gaming phenomenons. It has since struggled to find similar hits, in part because people tire of games and quickly find new ones, which flooded the market, including King\u2019s Candy Crush and Rovio\u2019s Angry Birds. Also, users began shifting toward mobile games, while Zynga had made its splash with desktop. And probably more than anything: Facebook, its primary distribution platform, continued tweaks to Facebook\u2019s newsfeed have had the effect of demoting Zynga\u2019s content. Pincus stepping down isn\u2019t entirely unexpected. He has had to cut staff from 3,500 to about 2,300, and put the company\u2019s iconic headquarters up for sale on 23 February. A massive seven-story building in San Francisco\u2019s Design District bought for $228m in 2012, the site includes a basketball court, gym, candy shop, and old time Winnebago. Parties at the headquarters (and there were always parties) were spectacular, and its closure marks the end of a certain heady era for those who believed wacky viral games could become viable businesses. Gibeau\u2019s background is in mobile gaming, including two decades at games stalwart Electronic Arts. He\u2019ll be pushing on some of Zynga\u2019s more successful ventures like their slot-machine games, which have in the past year become a major focus for the company. News of the new CEO sent stock up after hours more than 7%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
