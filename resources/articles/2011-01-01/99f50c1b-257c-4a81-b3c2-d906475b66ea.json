The co-owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, have yet to hear from O'Neill. Although it is unclear if the Northern Irishman, who walked away from his position as Aston Villa manager in August, would be interested, Allardyce wants a quick return to management following his dismissal by Blackburn Rovers last month but may have to be content initially with a contract until May. West Ham have been bottom of the league for most of the season and Grant believes that some within the club have begun to undermine him by briefing to the media that his job is in the balance. After Jonathan Spector and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piquionne gave West Ham an easy 2-0 victory over Barnsley that took them into the fourth round of the FA Cup, Grant spoke out regarding the whispers emanating from those around him. The Israeli also claimed he knows who is briefing against him. \"I don't want to think about this. I want to do my job,\" he said. \"Of course I know where the rumours come from and I know there's people trying to hurt the club. But if I put my energy on this it's no good. I want to put my energy on the team and the players. I can solve it but not now.\" Last Wednesday West Ham were routed 5-0 at Newcastle United, a manner of defeat that erased much of the positivity Grant had accrued from the team's previous run of eight points from four unbeaten league games. How can he prevent players being influenced by the speculation deriving from the club? \"This is the main problem. We need to create stability. When the rumours are coming from inside the club it doesn't create much stability,\" Grant said. \"But everyone has shown a great commitment. I've got great staff here. From the medical staff to the players. \"Everyone tries to analyse where the rumours are coming from but when you do that you're not in the right focus. We are not Sherlock Holmes, we want put our energy on this [the team]. Sometimes there are situations you don't like \u2013 you just have to deal with it.\" Ahead of Barnsley's visit to east London, Grant had discovered that Karren Brady, the vice-chairman, had revealed in her newspaper column why the deal to bring Steve Sidwell from Aston Villa had fallen through. She wrote: \"I had to tell Steve that for various reasons \u2013 none his fault \u2013 we had changed our mind about signing him on loan. This was a filthy task but in the end it was decided that with 13 midfielders and most of the injured about to return we couldn't promise him regular first-team football and he'd hardly be in a better position than at Villa.\" Asked about this, an obviously unhappy Grant said: \"I didn't read the column so I don't know what she said. Maybe I will have a column in a newspaper and say what I think. All the things I have to say to the people at the club I say to them directly.\" Does he speak to Brady? \"We don't have a problem, but I speak with the owners [Gold and Sullivan]. I'm dealing with the owners and that is the most important.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
