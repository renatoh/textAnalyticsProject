The measure, which comes two weeks after the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, declared a state of emergency, was announced hours after Spanish health authorities said the outbreak appeared to be peaking in parts of the country. In a televised address on Saturday evening, S\u00e1nchez ordered all those in non-key jobs to stay at home from Monday, saying the \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic. \u201cThis measure will reduce people\u2019s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,\u201d the prime minister said. S\u00e1nchez also warned that the EU needed to react to the global health crisis in a united and decisive fashion to safeguard its own future. \u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d he said. Earlier on Saturday, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said that the situation in some regions appeared to be improving even as the country reported another record single-day death toll of 832. The number of Covid-19 cases in the country rose from 64,059 on Friday to 72,248 on Saturday, and the number of dead now stands at 5,690. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d Sim\u00f3n told a press conference on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get confirmation, but we\u2019re getting close to the peak of the curve that we\u2019re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it \u2013 but we need to be cautious with preliminary information.\u201d He added: \u201cThe increase in cases is coming down in comparison with previous weeks, but it could be that there are cases that aren\u2019t being detected in some regions.\u201d But Sim\u00f3n also warned that reaching a peak would not ease the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched intensive care units (ICUs), adding that they were predicted to pass beyond full capacity in less than a week\u2019s time. \u201cWe still have a big problem when it comes to the overloading of our ICUs,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients who pick up the disease today may need a bed in an ICU in seven to 10 days. That means that we\u2019re still seeing a lag between the control of transmission and the saturation of ICUs. It also means they\u2019re going to be overloaded by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week.\u201d Even if Spain were close to its peak, said Sim\u00f3n, extra efforts had to be made to try to reduce the pressure on ICUs. Meanwhile, the director of Spain\u2019s Carlos III Health Institute said researchers were studying how plasma from patients who have recovered from the virus could be used to treat those in hospital. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep financing projects over the coming weeks,\u201d said Raquel Yotti. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ll carrying on working to ensure that Spain has the best diagnostic tests.\u201d Earlier this week, the Spanish government announced it had withdrawn 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. Like other countries struggling to diagnose and treat the virus, Spain has looked to China for rapid testing kits equipment and much-needed supplies, and announced this week that it would spend \u20ac432m (\u00a3390m) on tests, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. However, a batch of Chinese-made kits bought by Spanish health authorities a few weeks ago has been pulled after they were discovered to be unreliable and the Chinese government said they had been made by a company that did not appear on its list of authorised manufacturers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
