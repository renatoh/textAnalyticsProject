The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases NHS trust in Bath had its star rating upgraded after it emerged a mistake was made during collection of data for the annual performance tables published in July. The Department of Health (DoH) admitted an error occurred while data was being processed for the trust's staff opinion survey, which is one part of the ratings system. In the light of the mistake, the trust has now been upgraded from two stars to the highest three star rating. This means it is eligible for the additional freedoms and benefits available to top performing trusts, including a \u00a3250,000 one-off payment. It can now also apply for foundation status. The NHS Confederation, which represent health service managers, said the mistake showed the star ratings system still required improvement. A spokeswoman said: \"It's relatively early days for the star ratings system. There have been problems and some improvements but we're going to need to more improvements.\" Doubts were cast over the accuracy of the NHS league tables in July when SocietyGuardian.co.uk revealed that the DoH knowingly published \"inaccurate and invalid\" data about primary care organisations. The department admitted that at least 17 primary care groups (PCGs) and trusts (PCTs) provided the wrong data on the number of children immunised against measles, mumps and rubella and diphtheria. For its staff opinion survey in July the Royal National hospital scored one, which is significantly below average, but now this had been changed to a mark of four, which is above average. The DoH said the mistake resulted from a simple coding error when the data was collected by an external contractor organising the survey on its behalf. It stressed the trust was in no way at fault or able to identify or prevent the error occurring prior to the publication of the performance tables. Health minister Lord Philip Hunt said today: \"I would like to congratulate staff at the trust for their hard work in achieving a performance rating of three stars.\" The trust's chief executive, Nicola Carmichael, said: \"Because we do our own internal staff survey we felt morale was very good and so were quite concerned at the initial report based on the national staff survey. \"We were very pleased with an overall two star rating but this was one area we were concerned about.\" The trust highlighted its concerns and the error was found, resulting in the hospital being given three stars. Welcoming the new rating, Ms Carmichael said: \"It gives us immediate extra capital allocation and that gives us flexibility to develop the things we want to do in the trust. \"Also our staff work very hard and it is good to have that recognised.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
