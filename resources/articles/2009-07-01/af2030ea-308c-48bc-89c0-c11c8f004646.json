There is a distinctly purist air about the festival, organised by the English Folk Dance and Song Society, coming as it does in the same week that a song (\"Mr Tambourine Man\") written by Bob Dylan, leader of the \"commercial folkniks,\" slips smugly into the top of the hit parade. For two days the singers will listen to established singers, exchange songs with each other, go to lectures and demonstrations on song-writing and instrument playing \u2013 in an attempt to create a focal point for the rapidly increasing number of people turning to folk music. The folk boom, which began in Britain after the war in the back rooms of pubs, has since gathered in its wake many of those seeking a spontaneous outlet for their singing. A great number of younger folk singers trace their development from the skiffle cellars and rock and roll, through a graduation to blues and American folk, and then to a discovery of the heritage in their own country \u2013 those, that is, who had not already been led astray along the primrose path of pop. Folkists tend to sing traditional regional songs, best suited to their accents, and gleaned from written collections, tape recordings, or discovered by going to public-houses and coaxing older people to sing songs recalled from their childhood. To these are added songs written by themselves, generally protest songs (about apartheid, or the H-bomb). Mr Michael Dewdney \u2013 treasurer of the West Country Folk Club \u2013 commented: \"We keep away from commercial songs. Folk should be of the people, by the people, and for the people; it fails when it is written for commercial gain. Bob Dylan will never be remembered for his protest songs 40 years from now. The flavour of his songs is communistic, but he lives like a capitalist, having been pushed into a mould by the people behind him.\" Meanwhile, the singers continued to arrive at the university to sing their own favourite songs to whoever wanted to listen, seemingly content with that. Some of them protested that not even the arrival of a talent scout from a commercial record company could spoil the purity of their intentions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
