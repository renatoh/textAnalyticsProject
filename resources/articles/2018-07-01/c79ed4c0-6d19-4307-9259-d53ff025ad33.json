Thomas seemed overwhelmed by his second ski station stage win in 48 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d the Welshman said. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t believe it. Hopefully I can enjoy being in yellow tomorrow because it was hard to enjoy it today \u2013 the race was too hard. \u201cI never thought in my wildest dreams I would win today. In my head, all I had to do was follow the main guys. I just assumed someone would be away [ahead of us]. Even as I crossed the line I said: \u2018Is someone still away?\u2019\u201d Thomas now looks every inch a potential Tour winner, yet he still maintains Froome is Team Sky\u2019s designated leader and that he has not targeted final victory. \u201cNo, I just want to enjoy this victory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I honestly mean it when I say Froome is still our leader. He knows how to race for three weeks. For me, who knows, anything could happen, I could have a bad day and lose 10 minutes.\u201d While Thomas celebrated his win Sky\u2019s team principal, Dave Brailsford, was quick to criticise the unruly behaviour of some in the huge crowd, lining the 21 hairpins. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened to Nibali but I think Thomas went over his back wheel and nearly came off himself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou expect professional athletes to play and entertain without being impacted on by the crowd. I know this is part of the joy of our sport, how close the crowd gets, but we know that if it impacts the race, as it did today with Nibali then that\u2019s too much.\u201d Nibali\u2019s crash was enough to end his Tour after he suffered a fractured vertebra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
