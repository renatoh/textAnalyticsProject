Say goodbye to traditional Chinese fare in Beijing this August. Scorpion brochettes and goat lung with red pepper will not be available to our orient-bound athletes. The Xinhua News Agency reported that all dog meat - known in Chinese as 'xiangrou', or 'fragrant meat', and eaten by some for its purported health benefits - had been taken off the menu. Despite ridding restaurants of these dishes, there have been serious concerns about the safety of food for the games. Not only did Beijing send one thousand of its top chefs to the UK to bone up on bangers and mash back in February, but the government has also placed high levels of security on its farms. On Monday McClatchy Newspapers reported that in Changping, guards carefully monitor the perimeter of Lin Yuan's farm, where carrots, peppers, and tomatoes will ripen in what Nibbles imagines to be a sort of vegetable POW camp. If you think that's ridiculous, spare a thought for the 10 secret pig farms set up in the countryside to provide meat for the Olympic Village. Destined for the dinner plate, the animals get a strict two hours of exercise a day, eat organic feed and are monitored around the clock. Guards go so far as to mentally train them too: regular cries of \"Trough it you filthy beasts!\" and, \"Eat for China!\" ring out over the farmyard. (We freely admit our imagination ran away with us at this point). Somewhat predictably, the US Olympic Committee has ignored the hard work of farmers like Lin Yuan and is shipping 27,440 pounds of food to Beijing. Much of it comes from sponsors like Tyson, Hershey's and Kellogg's, and includes foods that either aren't easily sourced in China (s'mores anyone?) or are especially low in saturated fats. Tyson Foods, the world's largest meat conglomerate, says it has provided a shipment of 4,400 pounds of chicken, beef and pork to the U.S. Olympians and delegates for use at the games. Pig trotter soup is just not good enough for the U.S. athletic team who 'want specific American cuts of meat'. Diverting attention away from China and closer to home, a report compiled by the Soil Association, Sustain and the new economics foundation called Feeding the Olympics, says the London 2012 Olympics must promote healthy, sustainable food if it wants to be a green event. The group believe that the Games would be the perfect opportunity to highlight the benefits of local, seasonal and organic food and help promote sustainable fish consumption. We heartily agree. IN SEASON Urgh, it's fennel Nibbles is not a huge fan of fennel and has in the past (for shame) spurned the plant. No more! It is low in cholesterol, a good source of minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and potassium and an excellent source of vitamin C. Fennel also contains the oddly and somewhat onomatopeically-named chemical anethole, which relaxes the intestine. This makes it an ideal tonic to relieve the symptoms of IBS, stomach cramps and flatulence. Fennel's history is long and convoluted. In Greek mythology, Prometheus used a dry fennel stalk to steal fire from the gods. Also, it was from the giant fennel, Ferula communis, that the Bacchanalian wands of the god Dionysus and his followers were said to have come. Travelling through the mists of time, you can find its distinctive flavour in the spices of the Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese indigenous cuisines, and it's one of the spices used in Chinese Five Spice. Fennel-haters also have something in common with the humble flea - no, not the ability to leap tall buildings - the little critters dislike it too. To get rid of unwanted pests, you can sprinkle ground fennel seeds liberally on pet's bedding. The leaves of the plant itself are delicate and spidery and can be eaten; the bulb is crunchy and very versatile - fennel can be grilled, sauteed, stewed and eaten raw. The BBC website has a rather yummy sounding recipe for trout and fennel parcels which make a lovely special dinner. CRITIC'S QUOTE Better still was a spiced berry souffl\u00e9, the colour of a bishop's tunic, though rather more arousing. The waitress placed it on the table alongside a small jug of berry sauce and said: 'Shall I kill it?' And, with approval, took its virtue with a spoon to open up a slit for the syrup. Did I make that sound like some erotic exchange? Well, rightly so. For when food is as good as this, when the sensual and the physical become one, it does indeed transport you to another place. What can I tell you? The for sale sign goes up outside my house tonight. The Observer's Jay Rayner gets emotional about L'Anima BEST BUY Good news for cheese lovers everywhere. Following on from the successful launch of their first shop, La Cave a Fromage are now expanding and selling their wonderful farmhouse cheeses on-line. The website has a magnificent range of cheeses selected with the benefit of years of experience working with artisanal cheese producers. They supply cheeses from their depots to Michelin starred restaurants around the UK including Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons and Tom Aikens. The selection of 30 cheeses available online have been chosen with the benefit of their interaction with customers over the past six months and the most popular cheeses available in the shop. The site also contains details of the regular tasting events held at the shop in South Kensington to give the public the opportunity to find out more about farmhouse cheeses: where they are from, how they are produced and, most importantly, to taste cheeses that they haven't tried before. You'd have to be crackers not to visit. TOP TIPPLE What with the weather not being that great lately, why not put the booze back in the cupboard and invest in a nice cuppa to chase away the grey. Tea and Philosophy make fragrant, healthy blended teas that we guarantee will have co-workers following you around the office trying to sniff your mug. Warning: This may start to get irritating after a while. The tea-making instructions tickled us too. As well as boiling a kettle, Happiness tea recommends lying on the sofa like a great big slug, singing like Pavarotti and helping yourself to a huge slice of chocolate cake. Go buy it and spread the joy. Available from several stockists and also online.

L'Anima offers the finest of contemporary Italian cuisine and really posh products in the loos. The Deptford Project Caf\u00e9 is essentially a rather nice bistro in rather odd surroundings. Inside a heavily graffitied 1960s tube train located just off Deptford High Street market in London, the original fittings have vanished to be replaced by a long, colourful table, hand-painted stools and quirky lampshades. The food is pretty good too. Pantechnicon Rooms is newly opened on Motcomb Street with a bar and restaurant by the team who started the Thomas Cubitt on Elizabeth Street. Posh, vintage interiors with classic dishes. ROOM FOR AFTERS?
