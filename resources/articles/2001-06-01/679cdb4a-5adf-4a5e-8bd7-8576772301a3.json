They are sounding very unfriendly. Could they make me bankrupt? The golden rule is to keep the Revenue informed, to answer their letters and to negotiate. You can then often agree a three- to six-month period to repay your debts. Any longer is more difficult. On occasion the Revenue might agree to a couple of years - but this would be more likely where there are extenuating circumstances such as poor health. They can take various routes to reclaim what you owe: seizing your assets, taking you to a Magistrate's Court or County Court, or making you bankrupt. If you have equity in your house, this is an incentive for them to go for bankruptcy. The Revenue can be fearsome - particularly if you have annoyed them for a long time - and can make you bankrupt quite easily and quickly. They do not think it unreasonable to assume that the self-employed should be putting money aside. However, people who have cashflow problems because of foot-and-mouth disease are generally being treated with more leniency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
