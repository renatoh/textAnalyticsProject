The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s deep-pocketed modern literature archive announced today that after almost a year of negotiation, it has acquired the papers of the prizewinning Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who died in April aged 87. Neither the author\u2019s family nor the Ransom Center will disclose the amount of money that changed hands in the deal, but the Center, and the dealer it worked with, New York\u2019s Glenn Horowitz, are well known for the substantial prices they pay for the work of 20th-century writers. In May this year, the center acquired the novelist Ian McEwan\u2019s archive for a reported $2m. In addition to personal correspondence and photo albums, the collection includes two typewriters, five computers and an estimated 2,000 letters from correspondents such as Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Milan Kundera and Graham Greene. Stephen Enniss, the director of the Ransom Center, sounded jubilant today as he described Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s literary significance, which he considers comparable to James Joyce\u2019s. Although Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez did not like to keep early drafts of his work, the collection includes later typescripts that he corrected by hand. The exception is his unfinished, unpublished final novel, We\u2019ll See Each Other in August, which exists in around 10 drafts. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the writer\u2019s creative process,\u201d says Enniss. \u201cWe want to better understand how he accomplished these great works.\u201d The Ransom Center\u2019s emphasis on the purely literary value of the archive plays down the writer\u2019s political activism and his vocal opposition to United States policies on Cuba \u2014 Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was barred from entering the US for some three decades before President Clinton lifted his travel ban in 1995. This makes it surprising that the archive ended up in this country, rather than at an institution in Colombia, where the writer is a national hero. Today, senior cultural figures in Colombia expressed regret that the archive had not come home. Colombia\u2019s minister of culture, Mariana Garc\u00e9s, told RCN radio that it would have been an honor to have housed the archives in the country\u2019s National Library, and added, \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity for Colombia to not have them.\u201d Colombian academic Eduardo M\u00e1rceles put it more bluntly, claiming that the sale was akin to stripping away part of the country\u2019s history and culture. \u201cThe archives should have been put to an international auction so that Colombians could have at least had the opportunity to try to keep the archives,\u201d he told RCN Radio. \u201cThis is an incredibly important part of our heritage. The university of Texas has managed to get its hands on a priceless treasure.\u201d However, Gonzalo Garc\u00eda Barcha, one of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s two sons, said that Colombia never made any attempt to obtain the archives. \u201cThe government of Colombia was never interested,\u201d he told Colombia\u2019s Blu Radio. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make any offer.\u201d But Consuelo Gait\u00e1n, the director of the National Library of Colombia, denied that claim. \u201cThe government did show interest,\u201d she insisted to Blu Radio. \u201c[The family] never spoke to us about any kind of economic offer.\u201d Her stance was echoed on Twitter by the country\u2019s ministry of culture. \u201cThey said it was too soon after his death to speak about this. Colombia didn\u2019t receive any proposal,\u201d the ministry tweeted. Enniss said that a representative of the writer\u2019s family first contacted the center at the end of 2013, before Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s death, and that his was the first institution to be approached. In July this year Enniss traveled to the writer\u2019s home in Mexico City with his colleague Jose Montelongo, a Latin American literature specialist, to, he says, \u201cassess the research value of the collection for the students and scholars that the institution serves.\u201d Enniss stresses, however, that the acquisition will benefit scholars beyond UT. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing local about the institution,\u201d he says, noting that scholars from 24 countries visited the Center last year. The process of selling a writer\u2019s archive is lengthy and delicate. According to Frances Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner, director of the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race at Columbia University in New York, \u201cfinancial, preservation, and access considerations often trump ideological ones.\u201d In her own experience negotiating acquisitions for Columbia\u2019s Latino Arts and Activism archive, relationships and trust matter just as much. \u201cFamilies will gravitate to places that care about the work,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is such an emotional decision. It\u2019s about trust \u2014 you\u2019re giving your family member\u2019s history and legacy to strangers.\u201d Money is just one among several important considerations. \u201cFamilies need a lot of reassurance about both preservation and access,\u201d she says. \u201cMany times, it is not the writer that makes the decision to sell or donate the papers to a particular library or site.\u201d Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner points out, too, that although Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote often about his native country, \u201chis creative life largely unfolded outside of Colombia. He was also influenced by American writers and had personal ties to the US\u201d (his son Rodrigo lives in California.) National concerns, therefore, may have been secondary to the question as to whether the archive will still be in good shape, and accessible, in a hundred years. \u201cYou can argue about where it should go, but there needs to be something to argue about,\u201d says Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner. \u201cOnce you lose these types of materials, certain types of inquiry become impossible. We need to preserve them so that we can ask more and more complex questions about our past\u2014that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
