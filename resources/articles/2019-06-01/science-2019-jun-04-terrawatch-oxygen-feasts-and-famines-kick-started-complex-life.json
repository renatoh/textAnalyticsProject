The turning point happened about 540m years ago and is known as the Cambrian explosion. A plethora of complex creatures burst on to the scene, many of which were the precursors of the animal groups we see today. Now a new study reveals that oxygen was a crucial ingredient for this sudden flowering of life. By measuring carbon and sulphur isotopes in Cambrian rocks Tianchen He, from the University of Leeds, and colleagues were able to estimate the levels of oxygen in the air during this period. Comparing the oxygen levels with Cambrian fossil records revealed \u201cboom and bust\u201d cycles, with oxygen boosting the booms. The scientists think that when oxygen plummeted life was forced through evolutionary bottlenecks, and when oxygen rose again animals spread out and diversified rapidly. The dramatic swings persisted for many millions of years but eventually the emergence of large forests on land may have helped stabilise oxygen to modern levels. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unusual interval of Earth history when the Earth system could more easily flip,\u201d says He, whose findings were published in Nature Geoscience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
