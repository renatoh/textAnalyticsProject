That is simply not true. We have always tried to maintain contact and communications with all investors. \u201cNorthern Powerhouse Developments has informed the Guardian and ITV of the correct position and they have ignored us. \u201cWe currently employ more than 600 members of staff and our transformational Afan Valley project will create a further 1,000 jobs. \u201cWe encourage investors with concerns to contact us directly. We have always been transparent and this will continue going forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
