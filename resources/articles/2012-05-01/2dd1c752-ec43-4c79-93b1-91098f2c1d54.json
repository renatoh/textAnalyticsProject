Jonathan Apps and Tina Hallett spoke out after moving into their \u00a3587,000 home opposite the 15th-century All Saints' church in Wrington, Somerset, last October. A noise abatement notice was issued by North Somerset council, putting an end to the chimes that had rung every 15 minutes since the early 20th century. Council officials ordered the vicar, Nicholas Maddock, to switch off the chimes between 11pm and 7am or face prosecution, but church leaders had to silence it completely because the clock's software could not be programmed to stop it chiming at night. The couple withdrew their complaint on Saturday, saying they found the reaction from villagers \"very distressing\" and no longer wanted to pursue the case. In a joint statement with the church, they said they had received \"threatening and offensive letters\" and \"been the focus of some malicious comments on social media\". It went on to say that the couple had not asked for a noise abatement notice and had \"never intended to cause any offence to the local community\". But as the notice has been issued, the only options for the church are to comply with the order or appeal against it through the courts. The statement added that All Saints' \"deeply deplores any threatening behaviour that has been directed towards Jonathan and Tina\" and \"will continue to work to remove the noise abatement notice served by North Somerset council\". Church leaders are now appealing to the local community to welcome the couple to the village."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
