In the last six major championships in which he has competed the Australian has duly won the event, and he extended the sequence to seven on the opening day of the pool events at the world championships yesterday to become the first swimmer to win the same event in three successive championships. Yet, for a man who trades in the exceptional, this was an unremarkable swim. For three-quarters of the distance Thorpe had his compatriot Grant Hackett almost alongside, and from the first split his time was significantly off the world record - his own, naturally - pace. When Thorpe reached the meaningful end of the race he did pull clear of Hackett with some ease, but the finishing time of 3 minutes 42.58 seconds was exactly two and a half seconds slower than the world record he set in Manchester at last year's Commonwealth Games. This is not what we've come to expect. Coming into these championships Thorpe's credentials in the 400m were impeccable. In five of his last major championships the 20-year-old had not only won this title but had broken the world record too. Nevertheless, for the first time since 1999, when Thorpe's world record spree at the Pan Pacifics announced his arrival on the world stage, there were questions to answer. In December last year Thorpe parted company with his long-standing coach Doug Frost and teamed up with Tracey Menzies. The 30-year-old Menzies is almost half Frost's age and the new arrangement signalled a philosophical change, with the dour mentor replaced by a woman seeking to bring enjoyment back to Thorpe's programme. However, by changing coach Thorpe could be seen as trying to mend something that was not broken. After all, in his last championship with Frost as coach - the Commonwealth Games - he had broken the 400m world record. Thorpe's second swim yesterday, in the 4x100m relay, did not resolve those issues either. By the time his team-mate Adam Pine had touched the wall underneath his feet, Alexander Popov and Jason Lezak were just dots on the horizon. Popov, the former world champion, held off the American Lezak to give the Russians the title, with the US - without the boy wonder Michael Phelps in the team - taking silver. The French will be heartened by their bronze medal, and even more so by the manner in which their last-leg swimmer Frederick Bousquet, with a split time of 47.03s (the second fastest ever), dragged them there. Popov, Thorpe and the Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband will be wary of the Frenchman in the 100m individual now. Having disappointed in the men's relay, the Australians also got less from the women's event than they had hoped. Thanks to a firey final leg from Jenny Thompson, the US team took the gold medal ahead of the Germans. It is early days yet, but the Australian total of 13 gold medals from the last world championships must seem like a hazy mirage. The medal chance that Britain had on the opening day also turned out to be a fleeting vision. In the women's 4x100m freestyle relay Alison Sheppard slumped from third at the 50m turn to a distant seventh at 100m, from where the remaining team members did well to claw back a few feet and finish fifth. In the 100m breaststroke semi-finals both James Gibson and Darren Mew qualified for today's final. Gibson recorded his second fastest time to win his semi-final, but the Japanese swimmer Kosuke Kitajima then went even quicker, missing Roman Sloudnov's world record by just four hundredth's of a second. In the semi-finals of the 50m butterfly it was business as usual for Mark Foster, who qualified for today's final as fourth fastest. The 33-year-old Foster will also compete in the 50m freestyle, but as often seems to be the case he looks far more likely to medal in what he considers his weaker event, the butterfly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
