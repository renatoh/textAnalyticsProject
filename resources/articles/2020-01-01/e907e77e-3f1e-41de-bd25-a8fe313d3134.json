Cheshire constabulary was notified on 15 December that suspected human remains had been found by the Manchester Ship Canal near Frodsham, and officers confirmed that they had initially been in the water. After carrying out extensive DNA tests, the force was able on Friday to identify them as belonging to Marie Scott, a 57-year-old who was reported missing from her home in Hale, Greater Manchester, in December 2017. In November 2018, a dog walker reported seeing an object in the River Irwell in Pendleton, two miles to the north-west of Manchester city centre, which was subsequently identified as a human leg. This was also confirmed to belong to Scott. The two sites are linked waterways, but are more than 25 miles apart. Police enquiries into Scott\u2019s disappearance continue, but there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances. DI Simon Akker of Greater Manchester police said: \u201cHaving been personally involved in Marie\u2019s case since she was reported missing in 2017, and having met with her family several times, my heart truly goes out to them. \u201cThis has been an agonising journey for those closest to Marie and we will support them as they continue to come to terms with the loss of Marie.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
