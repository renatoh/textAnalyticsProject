Ferdinand suffered terribly as the victim in the most controversial incident of alleged racial abuse in the history of English football. During a Premier League game between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea in October 2011, John Terry said the words \u201cfucking black cunt\u201d in a spat with Ferdinand that ended up in court and the subject of a Football Association disciplinary hearing \u2013 which cost Terry the England captaincy. Until now, however, the world has been oblivious to the pain Ferdinand endured. His decision to remain silent burned a hole inside him. \u201cI have kicked myself and beat myself up for years for not speaking out,\u201d he says quietly. This is Ferdinand\u2019s first interview since participating in a searing and deeply moving BBC documentary \u2013 Football, Racism and Me \u2013 which will be screened a week on Monday. His mood is composed but raw, for it is now time for him to talk about racism. The latest figures documenting racial hate in football have just been released by Kick It Out. In the 2019-20 season, there was a 53% increase in reported racial abuse in professional football. Until the pandemic brought an end to grassroots football in March there had been 11% more reported racial incidents among amateur players. It\u2019s a bleak Monday morning in Essex, and Ferdinand and I face each other at a safe social distance. Our masks have been removed and the hurt is etched into the face of the 35-year-old former footballer. Ferdinand also played in the Premier League for West Ham and Sunderland and 17 times for England Under-21s while his older brother, Rio, earned 81 senior caps and won the Premier League and Champions League with Manchester United. Yet Ferdinand points out that his seven-year-old son \u201casked: \u2018Dad, why is it that when I Google your name there are pictures of you and John Terry?\u2019\u201d That connection with Terry means Ferdinand has been associated with the case before everything else he has achieved. In a depressingly familiar way, the innocent victim of alleged racism had been made to feel guilty while receiving relentless abuse, death threats and bullets in the post. Ferdinand chose to say nothing because he just wanted to play football and he trusted the authorities. But his career declined and as he says now: \u201cI hated football for a long time. I loved playing it, but I hated what it stood for.\u201d His sense of shame and pain intensified because his white mum and black dad wanted him to talk publicly about the Terry incident. \u201cMe and Rio were brought up to speak out,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cThat\u2019s why my mum and dad were so adamant and said: \u2018Speak.\u2019 Personally, it kills me I went against what I was brought up to do. But I was advised I couldn\u2019t speak because we could harm the investigation. I wish I would have spoken but there was so much publicity and legalities. And, honestly, the pressure was too much.\u201d Rio and Anton grew up in Peckham and, in the mid-1980s, their mum endured horrendous racism. She and baby Anton were spat on when she pushed him in a pram. \u201cMy white mum told me I\u2019d be treated differently because of the colour of my skin,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cShe made me aware. She educated herself plus she went through so much \u2013 getting beat up, getting spat on because a black baby was in her pram and being with a black man. That was the era then. My mum was open about it. My dad was open too because when he first come to England from St Lucia people would drive past and shout stuff at him.\u201d In the documentary, Anton, Rio and their dad return to the Peckham estate. Anton remembers being harassed by the police as a kid and how his parents taught him to be wary. They said it was imperative, if asked by the police, to turn out his pockets rather than allow anyone to do it for him. Will he give the same advice to his children? \u201cThings are a bit different now but I will still educate them because you never know. But for my kids\u2019 generation there\u2019s much more acceptance. It\u2019s our job as parents to make sure it stays that way.\u201d As a young defender for West Ham, Ferdinand saw only a magnificent footballer when he looked up to John Terry. Even now, Ferdinand shows genuine affection when holding the signed shirt Terry gave to him after West Ham played Chelsea in 2005. Terry added a long and supportive message. \u201cI felt 10-foot tall,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cIt was amazing someone of his stature wrote a message like that, saying I was a good player. I was excited.\u201d Ferdinand joined QPR on 1 September 2011, seven weeks before his life changed for ever. \u201cI felt in a good place. I was back in London after four years at Sunderland, which I loved. But I loved big games and QPR hadn\u2019t played Chelsea for 15 years. They were a fantastic team but, at home in front of our fans on a tight pitch, we knew we had a chance. \u201cI stood in the tunnel next to Didier Drogba, John Terry, whose credentials as a footballer are second to none, Frank Lampard and Nicolas Anelka, thinking I\u2019m going to be the best player on the pitch. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up now because that\u2019s what this little boy in Peckham dreamed about many moons ago. Nothing was going to get in my way.\u201d It was a wild derby. \u201cThey had two players sent off,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cWe were winning and they were desperate to get back in the game. John came up for a long throw and I eased him out of the way. He fell theatrically to try and get a penalty and I turned round and said: \u2018Get up, you\u2019re bigger than me.\u2019 He ran and barged me, so I barged him back. The game got stopped, words were exchanged and it was our free-kick. Paddy Kenny [QPR\u2019s keeper] comes to take the free-kick. John jogs back into his position and then he said whatever he said while the camera panned on him. I didn\u2019t hear anything at the time. I was back in the game. We went on to win and I was buzzing.\u201d Soon after the final whistle Terry asked to see Ferdinand. \u201cWe had a chat in the dressing room. He asked if I\u2019m OK. I said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m fine\u2019, oblivious to what had gone on. I embraced him and then went upstairs. My family were in a box and I walked in with a spring in my step. I was so happy. It was very quiet and my mum said: \u2018Anton, are you all right?\u2019 My wife went: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yeah, we just beat Chelsea!\u2019 My mum said: \u2018Did John Terry racially abuse you, Anton?\u2019 I said: \u2018No.\u2019 My wife went: \u2018You\u2019d better look at this.\u2019 She handed me the phone. I see [Terry clearly saying the offensive words], give it back and go to walk downstairs. The only person who could have stopped me that day was my mum.\u201d Ferdinand says his \u201cblood was boiling\u201d but his mum \u201cshouted at me and I turned around and she said: \u2018I know what you want to do but now is not the time.\u2019\u201d The online footage of Terry had already gone viral. Ferdinand shakes his head. \u201cI was hurt and angry. People that haven\u2019t had racial language shouted at them online or by another person won\u2019t understand that and that\u2019s why I made the documentary \u2013 to show the ripple effects. People at board level ain\u2019t ever going to feel that. What they can do is open their minds and become understanding by listening to people who have felt it, and working closely with us.\u201d A member of the public, rather than Ferdinand, laid a charge against Terry, who faced a courtroom trial in July 2012. Terry\u2019s defence rested on his claim that he thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying the words \u201cfucking black cunt\u201d and that he had merely repeated them while denying he had said them first. After four days the magistrate found Ferdinand to be a \u201cbelievable witness\u201d and that \u201cMr Terry\u2019s explanation is, certainly under the cold light of forensic examination, unlikely\u201d. Yet the television cameras had not captured everything Terry had said and so the court decided there was sufficient doubt and ruled that he was not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence. In the documentary Ferdinand draws a stark contrast between the FA\u2019s seemingly friendly questioning of Terry and his own meeting with the governing body \u2013 which felt like an interrogation. But the FA still found Terry guilty of \u201cusing abusive and/or insulting words \u2026 which included a reference to colour and/or race\u201d. In September 2012, Terry was banned for four games and fined \u00a3220,000. He also lost the England captaincy which made the national coach, Fabio Capello, resign in fury. On social media Ferdinand was swamped yet again by waves of savage racism. He was also hurt that he received no support from anti-racism bodies such as Kick It Out, which criticised his silence. Troy Townsend, the admirable head of development at Kick It Out, tells Ferdinand how sorry he is while admitting his organisation is funded by the FA and every time he speaks out he believes he could lose his job. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was shocked,\u201d Ferdinand suggests when he considers Kick It Out\u2019s latest set of racism statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s always there, and it\u2019s probably a sign that people are braver now and speaking out because they feel more supported.\u201d How did Ferdinand feel when, last week, Greg Clarke resigned as chairman of the FA after using racially offensive language? \u201cI was disappointed because the good work that they\u2019re doing with the diversity code got spoilt. It was a kick in the teeth and shows how far we are from making things better. But the board and people right across the FA should mirror the England team \u2013 which is diverse. Throughout every age group England\u2019s teams are a mixture of different races and that should be mirrored.\u201d There are many powerful moments in Ferdinand\u2019s documentary \u2013 including his decision to meet Ren\u00e9e Hector, who played for Spurs and went public with her allegation that she was racially abused by an opponent during a match against Sheffield United in January 2019. Sophie Jones denied the allegations but was found guilty by the FA. \u201cIt was important to include her because football is not just a male sport,\u201d Ferdinand says of Hector, who has since moved to Watford. \u201cHer story mirrors mine. It was imperative we compared stories because the way we dealt with it was different. I was proud of her speaking out when I didn\u2019t.\u201d Ferdinand nods when I say it must have made him feel vulnerable to contrast his agonised silence with Hector\u2019s public reaction. \u201cIt was very tough. But this documentary was made for the next generation. It was about them seeing a contrast and the different ways it played out. It\u2019s part of educating the next generation and for them to know that, if they suffer from racial abuse, I want to be someone that they can speak to. The key thing for them is to keep control of your story rather than allowing others to narrate it for you.\u201d Hector shares a message sent to her of a mocked-up pregnancy scan which shows the foetus of a baby gorilla. Ferdinand tells the 25-year-old how proud he is of her defiance of such racism. After he confesses to feeling embarrassed that he had not also raised his voice, Hector reminds Ferdinand that his previous silence is immaterial. All that matters is that he is speaking up now. \u201cIt was a pivotal moment,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cWow! Somebody who actually knows how I felt is proud of me. I didn\u2019t accept them words straightaway because it had been on me for so long. Then I felt lighter because I realised life is about timing and I\u2019m speaking out at the right time for me.\u201d Terry did not respond to a message from Ferdinand in late summer. Towards the end of the documentary, as Ferdinand tries again to arrange a meeting between them, the television production team is told that Terry does not want to reopen a case already settled in court and that he has \u201cmoved on with his life\u201d. Ferdinand is neither angry nor bitter. \u201cI respect his decision. I just wanted him to understand that it\u2019s bigger than me and him. I don\u2019t know whether he thought I wanted him to apologise \u2013 but that\u2019s never been my aim. My aim is bigger than me and him. Let\u2019s use our stories to make a difference.\u201d It has been hard for Ferdinand to move on with his own life because he worried that his mum, whom he lost to cancer, had fallen ill as a direct result of his troubles. \u201cThere were ripple effects. Her house was targeted. Eggs and bricks were thrown. There were death threats. I know it wasn\u2019t my fault that she fell ill, but consciously [the worry] was always there. Watching the documentary through my family\u2019s eyes I understood that my mum couldn\u2019t help when normally she would have done. She was watching her son go through something she went through many years ago. I was able to understand why subconsciously I blamed myself, why at times I couldn\u2019t sleep and I was frightened of myself.\u201d Ferdinand is remarkably calm, and even hopeful that society and football will soon change for the better. \u201cI always have hope because we\u2019re fighting for equality. I hope I see it in my lifetime. If this documentary plays a small part in that change then I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d On the last day of filming Ferdinand found the courage to talk to young black and white players at the West Ham academy. He spoke about his turmoil and then said that they should not feel alone if they are subjected to any form of racial abuse. Ferdinand and others who been have through the same experience will support them. The footballers responded with applause. Ferdinand looks at me, his face creasing with emotion at the memory, and then he smiles. \u201cThe last scene at West Ham ain\u2019t in the documentary, but James Ross, the film-maker, asked me one last question. I finished answering and I got up. I walked the length of the pitch. I was looking up at the sky and tears were streaming down my face. I know my mum would have been proud seeing me own my voice again. I kept saying: \u2018Mum, I\u2019ve done it. I finished it. I\u2019ve spoken.\u2019\u201d Anton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me, Monday 30 November, 9pm, BBC One"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
