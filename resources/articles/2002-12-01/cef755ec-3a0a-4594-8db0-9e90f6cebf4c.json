Ellis was with Millichip, West Brom's president and former chairman, when he collapsed at Edgbaston golf club's annual dinner. He was taken to Selly Oak hospital. \"He was very strong,\" Ellis said. \"He had a legal background and it's not easy in the FA, with 92 councillors, to get unanimity. But believe me he used to get it time and time again. I'm very sad we have lost Bert at the age of 88. \"I was with him [when he died]. He was at my table and suddenly I saw his head go down and realised there was something very serious. He was trying to get his tie off and eventually he managed and we tried to massage him. \"Naturally his wife was distressed and tried to help and revive him. We had a doctor in the house and we pumped his chest and tried to revive him without much success. \"Eventually the ambulance arrived and I must say the paramedics were fantastic. They tried their damnedest for 20 minutes to get him going again, but to no avail. When he got in the ambulance I felt he was already dead. \"It was 34 years ago today that I took the chair at Aston Villa and Bert was one of the first to congratulate me.\" Ellis added that Millichip, upon retiring in 1996, had asked if he was willing to take over as FA chairman but he turned down the opportunity. \"He asked if I would be prepared to give up the chairmanship of Aston Villa. I said I would have to think about it but I think he knew right away that I wouldn't do that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
