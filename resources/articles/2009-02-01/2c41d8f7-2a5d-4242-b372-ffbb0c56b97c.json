Alan Johnson, the health secretary and a former union leader, claimed that rulings from the European court of justice could have \"distorted\" the intention of EU legislation meant to ensure that employers cannot circumvent national rules about pay and conditions by bringing in employees from abroad. In an interview broadcast today, Gordon Brown said the unofficial action - described as \"more like protests than strikes\" by one Whitehall official - was \"not defensible\". But the government is anxious not to antagonise the unions or the workers they represent and today Johnson and Jack Straw, the justice secretary, both said that the dispute may have identified a legitimate grievance. The protests on Friday \"did not have any impact on the security of fuel supply\", according to officials. But ministers are monitoring the situation and hope that the conciliation service Acas, which will today start its investigation into the origins of the dispute at the Lindsey refinery on the Humber estuary, will be able to present its initial findings to the business secretary, Lord Mandelson, in the next few days. In an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Johnson said he could understand the anger of the protesters. \"If workers are being brought across here on worse terms and conditions to actually get jobs in front of British workers ... that would be wrong and I can understand the anger about that,\" he said. Foreign contractors who employ their own staff on a temporary project are bound by the EU's \"posted workers\" directive, which stipulates that the foreign employees must enjoy the same rights as local workers. But Johnson suggested this was being undermined by rulings from the European court of justice. \"These various judgments have distorted the original intention and we need to bring in fresh directives to make it absolutely clear that people cannot be undercut in this way,\" he said. In a separate interview, Straw said it was important to establish whether \"British firms and British workers had a fair crack of the whip\" in relation to the contract awarded by Total at the Lindsey refinery that sparked protests around the country. Peter Hain, the former work and pensions secretary, said today he thought something had gone \"badly wrong\" with the way EU legislation was being enforced. \"I do not believe that those Italian and other workers [at the Lindsey refinery] can be getting the same conditions and rights and pay as the British workers who would have filled those jobs would be entitled to,\" Hain told the BBC's World this Weekend. \"I just cannot see it, given the extra cost of bringing them over, of housing them in temporary accommodation, of transporting them to and from work. Clearly something fishy is going on.\" Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the prime minister should never have promised \"British jobs for British workers\" because he knew that a literal application of that policy would have been illegal under EU law. Clegg said the government should support EU labour rules, not criticise them, because there were two million British citizens living and working in the rest of the EU, but only one million people from other EU countries living in the UK. But Frank Field, the Labour former welfare minister, said his party could face \"a wipeout\" at the next general election if it did not tighten immigration policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
