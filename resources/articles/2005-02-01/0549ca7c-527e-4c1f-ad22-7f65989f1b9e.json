Most people are aware of its reputation as centre of gravity for the world's renaissance art treasures - more than a fifth of the total resides within a square mile here - and in the summer it feels like a fifth of the world's sightseers are here too. As my girlfriend and I lurch along the street, the miserable expression of one who has witnessed centuries of debauchery - and has his own ideas about where it will land us - stares down grimly. 'Happy New Year Dante,' we cry, over the banging and smashing of squibs, rockets and Prosecco bottles being launched into the Piazza del Santa Croce. Our Florentine fantasy is complete. A good trip allows you a holiday from yourself. You want to try out a different persona - chin-stroking existentialist in Paris, master of the universe in New York, renaissance man in Florence - but not a tourist in a tourist trap. In Florence, you can only pull it off in the bright cold days of winter when there are fewer tourists, less queueing, less heat, more time, more air, more magic. The life of a Florentine rake wouldn't involve hours queuing to see art - the art would just be a lavish backdrop to your life. Renting an apartment is the first weapon in the armoury of the temporary resident. I'm not a tourist, I live here. Check out my keys, and the garret I live in, right in the centre of town, complete with stove, candles and DVD collection - faccia di merda, they're in Italian. Florentines do exist beyond the massed ranks of tourists. The clich\u00e9s say they're renowned for their willingness to go into debt for their clothes and for their pride in their food and their city. They're tremendously laid-back and friendly too. Florence was Italy's fashion capital until the 1960s when the more accessible Milan stole the title. If your fetish is being mown down by an old woman whose fur coat cost more than your home, the Via de' Tornabuoni is the place to go. Here are boutiques for the lot, from Armani to Emilio Zegna, via native sons Ferragamo and Gucci. This is civilised (window) shopping, not a sale in sight, but if you insist, there are winter sales that push on through February in outlet stores around town, and buses to cut-price out-of-town warehouses of Gucci and Prada. If you're after lower-rent chic, the Via Roma area has high street favourites with an Italian twist. I prefer shopping on the other, quieter side of the city centre at the Mercato Sant' Ambrogio, where Tuscan farm produce vies with cheap shoddy kids clothes and four pairs of socks for a euro. We skip the local favourites - offal, tripe - instead taking cuts of wild boar, plump juicy tomatoes, freshly rolled pasta, and haunches of saltless bread to see what we can cook up at home. The joys of Florence have been well documented. With its buildings, frescoes, paintings and statues by Donatello, Ghiberti, Michelangelo, Brunelleschi and Botticelli, it is a time capsule of the renaissance, stamped with the hope, fear, brutality and sublimity of the period. The dominance of buildings and artworks that are 400-600 years old draws you to contemplate the psyche of 15th-century Florentines. Sauntering around the Boboli Gardens - magnificently laid out for the Medici family on a hill overlooking the town centre - it's easy to end up walking between the trees and sculptures without a tourist in sight, imagining yourself a conte or contessa taking a turn before some Bacchanalian feast. Wandering into the Piazza della Signoria at night you can pretty much have it to yourself. Site of political decisions, executions and sublime works of art, your eyes are drawn up to the menacing vertiginous Torre Vecchio then down to Michelangelo's stunning, legendary Boy David (a copy, the real thing is in the Accademia). The signoria, visiting merchants, noblemen and preachers, would stand on a terrace at the base of the palazzo here and give speeches. One is said to have angered his audience so much that they ate a man in the crowd. Savonarola, a visionary ascetic monk, preached damnation here, terrifying many Florentines into piety. As his influence waxed he organised a huge 'Bonfire of the Vanities' on which works of art, poetry, fancy clothes and other fripperies, which were sending Florentines hellwards, were burned. As it waned he was tortured, hung and burned; both fires took place in this piazza. When the 'David' was first presented here in 1504, Florentines came in their droves to marvel at the sculpture. The aesthetic appreciation of the Florentines is encapsulated by the story of a 15th-century man being driven by cart to the gallows, complaining of the bumpy ride: 'What idiot hewed these flagstones?' Staying in an apartment saves cash, which must then be spent, so we follow in the footsteps of George Clooney, Claudia Schiffer and Winona Ryder to the Bernini Palace Hotel where we are shown to a beautiful room with three plush beds in it. 'Oh no,' says the concierge, 'there's been a mistake.' Before I can say to my girlfriend, 'Any nook does for me, but it does seem hard that you shouldn't have a view,' we are whisked off to room 508, with a view to make Lucy Honeychurch weak at the knees. Across the Piazza della Firenze stand the Badia spire, the Barghello tower and Brunelleschi's dome, oranging in the gloaming. The bells ring out. Off to Trattoria Pallotino, where the simple tasty food makes you glad to be alive. Cheerful Florentines exchange new year's greetings over platters of delicious beef stew, sumptuous artichoke and salami, bistecca tagliati - steak covered in rocket and parmesan shavings - and, of course, a hearty glass or two of Chianti. It's New Year's Eve so after dinner we spend a good portion of the night drinking flutes of Prosecco in the Moyo, a swish new bar minutes from the hotel, before heading into the Piazza della Signoria to join thousands of Florentines flinging fireworks and bottles on to the flagstones to ring in 2005. Then it's off to Salamanca bar for rum-based cocktails, salsa-based dances and Florentines claiming to be sculptors. This seemed convincing at the time but a manifest crock of bull the next day, especially as they were desperately trying to pull my girlfriend. Somewhat heavy-headed in 2005, breakfast in the Sala Corsini is a high-class treat. It feels right sipping strong cappuccino scanning the pictures in the Corriere della Sera newspaper under the 25ft-high arched ceiling frescoed with gay garlanded cherub scenes and portraits of the architects of the birth of modern Italy: Cavour, Brofferio and Garibaldi. Orchids, heavy silver cutlery, bacon and eggs complete the mirage. Florence is deserted. We stroll over the Ponte Vecchio and along the south bank of the Arno looking back at the fabulous silhouettes of the Duomo's dome, Giotto's campanile and the Torre Vecchio. Returning round Santa Croce we come to Dante's sculpture again. ' Buono Anno Nuovo'. He stares down grimly.
