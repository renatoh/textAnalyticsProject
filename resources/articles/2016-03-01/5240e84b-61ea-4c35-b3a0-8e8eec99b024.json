If this was a familiar occasion for Wenger, a sixth successive exit at the first knockout stage, there was a familiarity too about Arsenal\u2019s second-leg performance here, and about the manager\u2019s attempts to apply a gloss of late-blooming optimism to a low-key game. \u201cI think the performance and the quality of our game was good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the result; we played against a team with the best strikers I\u2019ve seen. The three together are exceptional. They can create chances from nothing. From the bench at 1-1 they were wobbling a little bit and they weren\u2019t secure. We could not take our chance to score the second goal that would have put us in a strong position.\u201d Wenger\u2019s suggestion that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s 5-1 aggregate winners were wobbling might raise a few eyebrows. But he can at least point to the quality of Arsenal\u2019s opponents down those six years of disappointment. \u201cIn England you are committed enough to use all the statistics to make sure that we will suffer, I trust you to do that,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIt\u2019s true we have gone out in the last six years against a top team, who have gone on and won the competition. One was against Monaco but the others are Barcelona and Bayern Munich.\u201d It could, of course, be suggested the quality of Arsenal\u2019s opponents is commensurate with a failure to top their group, a sequence Manchester City finally broke this season, their reward a knockout tie with Dynamo Kyiv. For Wenger and Arsenal the season is now reduced to a nine-match sprint for another top-four spot, the Champions League simply another opportunity to observe at close hand the very best. \u201cWe created plenty of dangerous situations but we couldn\u2019t take the chance. As well, Barcelona going forward, the accuracy of their passing, especially Messi, is exceptional. Over 90 minutes he didn\u2019t miss one first touch. At some point in sport you have to admire art. They have two or three players who transform normal life into art and I respect that. Of course, for me it\u2019s suffering but it\u2019s exceptional.\u201d Wenger played down suggestions Mathieu Flamini had stormed off the pitch before sitting and watching the rest of the match on his own in the press room, remarking simply that Flamini had injured a hamstring. Either way it seems likely this could have been a final European match at the club for Arsenal\u2019s last remaining relic from their run to the final in 2006. For Luis Enrique it was simply an occasion to admire, not just the skills but the spirit of his own attack. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious we have unique players,\u201d Barcelona\u2019s manager said. \u201cWe have players that on their day can solve many situations. But I believe the importance of this team is these players also work as a team offensively and defensively.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
