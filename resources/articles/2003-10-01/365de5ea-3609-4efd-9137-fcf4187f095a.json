Birch assumes control at a club that are second from bottom in the Premiership and will announce annual losses of almost \u00a350m - the worst in Premiership history. The Elland Road club's last reported debt was \u00a379m and relegation to the Nationwide League would be catastrophic - Leeds would almost certainly go into administration and may even cease to exist. But the club are now pinning their hopes on Birch, the former Chelsea chief executive, in salvaging their fortunes and returning financial affairs to a more even keel. The 45-year-old has agreed an incentivised contract worth around \u00a3300,000 a year. While the Leeds chairman, Professor John McKenzie, concentrates on restructuring the club's existing debt and trying to secure investors from the Far East, where he has close contacts, Birch will take sole control of the day-to-day running of the club. He rejected approaches from both Aston Villa and Manchester City to accept the offer. The team can help Birch make the perfect start by beating Manchester United tonight in the Carling Cup. But victories for Peter Reid's side have been scarce this season and their woeful form has only served to increase the need for radical changes within the club. McKenzie has made inroads into what he describes as the club's \"indulgences of the past\". This is a direct reference to the legacy of his predecessor Peter Ridsdale, who stepped down in March but has been dogged by stories of extravagant spending when both he and Leeds were \"living the dream\". Luxuries such as tropical fish, the use of private jets, exorbitant salaries and company Mercedes have become a thing of the past, yet the club's future remains anything but secure. The combined responsibility of trimming debts, restructuring the squad and travelling the world in search of new investors has taken its toll on McKenzie, who showed his limitations earlier this month by asking supporters if he should sack Reid. The plc's vice-chairman Allan Leighton recognised the pressure on McKenzie and instructed him to find a chief executive with the financial acumen necessary to meet the challenge. McKenzie turned to Birch after he was released by Chelsea when the Blues tempted Peter Kenyon from Manchester United. A Leeds source said: \"Trevor Birch is one of the most respected men in the game in terms of the field he specialises in. He is just the sort of person Leeds need. If he can't pull things round then no one can, but at least the club will have given it their best shot.\" McKenzie is bracing himself for a backlash when the latest financial figures are released today but believes that interim results due to be published next April will provide a more accurate assessment of the progress he has made. McKenzie is expected to step down to a non-executive role while several board members have agreed to invest extra capital into the club from their own pockets. If Leeds fail to beat United this evening and then lose at home to Arsenal on Saturday Birch's first job could be to appoint a new manager. Reid has the full support of his players but having taken just eight points from 10 Premiership matches this season, and with Leeds second from bottom of the table, his position remains precarious. With plenty already to worry about, Reid has tried to distance himself from both the latest financial failings and Birch's arrival. \"I don't want to get involved in that side of things, I'm just trying to concentrate on the next two games,\" he said. \"Beating Manchester United could kick-start our season and help us go on a good run. \"Eight points from 10 games is not good enough. The industry I'm in is all about winning games and getting points. But you get problems as a manager and you have to deal with them. It's not a bed of roses. But there are people worse off than me - so I don't have a problem with it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
