But the pendulum which has now swung against foreign managers of national teams once swung equally strongly in favour of them \u2013 with good reason, if results are a guide. The last two native-born England managers, Kevin Keegan and Steve McClaren, had win percentages of 39% and 50% respectively. Neither of them lasted two years. Both left under clouds. By contrast their successors, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, lasted nearly six and just over four years and had win percentages of 60% and 67%. There are many reasons why a home-grown candidate may be a good fit this time, but success on the field, not national pride, is still the ultimate test. The pendulum that has swung against foreign managers will swing back in favour of them soon enough if the right foreign candidate comes along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
