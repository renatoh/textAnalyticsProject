His French Open triumph on Monday gave him an 11th grand slam title and if his body holds out for a few more years, he may yet threaten Roger Federer's record of 16. Nadal is a tennis traditionalist; winning the sport's biggest prizes means more to him than chasing cash. But he is also a pragmatist, it seems, because rather than warm up for Wimbledon by playing in the Aegon Championship at London's Queen's Club, as he has done every year since 2006 but one, when he was injured, Nadal is in the German town of Halle for the Gerry Weber Open. As the meticulous positioning of his water bottles would suggest, he is not one to change for the sake of it. This is all about money. Last year Nadal said that if he were to continue to play at Queen's he would actually \"lose money\" because of the UK's tax laws, which affect overseas stars by taking a percentage of their global endorsements as well as prize money. At the time Chris Kermode, the tournament director at Queen's, warned that it was becoming more and more difficult to attract the game's top stars, especially as Halle is willing to pay as much as, if not more than, Queen's in appearance money. The UK government amended the tax rules in the March budget, which should help in future but which came too late for Nadal, who joined Federer in the Halle field. Andy Murray recently signed a five-year deal to play at Queen's, reportedly worth more than \u00a31m in appearance money; Nadal's three-year deal in Halle is likely to be worth more. As the 26-year-old celebrated winning his seventh French Open crown on Monday, news broke that a thief had helped himself to a Richard Mille watch worth around \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3243,000) from Nadal's hotel room in Paris. The Nadal camp confirmed on Wednesday that the thief, reportedly a hotel barman, had been caught and Nadal said the police had \"done good work\". \"I'll be back in the hotel next year,\" he said. Nadal begins his title bid in Halle on Thursday, against Lukas Lacko of Slovakia. On Wednesday he joined his compatriot Marcel Granollers to beat Michal Mertinak of Slovakia and Viktor Troiki of Serbia in the first round of the doubles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
