Giving evidence to the work and pensions select committee, the minister for family support, Will Quince, apologised for a memo his department sent to the committee last month and said it \u201cdid not very well reflect my views on this issue\u201d. The memo dismissed evidence that universal credit was a cause of increased numbers of women turning to sex work as anecdotal. It said the phenomenon was influenced by a range of factors, from drug addiction and the rise of AirBnB to EU immigration. Quince told the committee he had changed his views after hearing accounts from four women who gave evidence of how impoverishment related to universal credit issues had led them to take up escort and brothel work. \u201cThose very brave testimonies of the young women who have gone through the most horrific of experiences gave me a better understanding through their lived experiences. What it showed me more than anything is we need to better understand this area,\u201d he said. A transcript of the private committee hearing in May included a testimony from M, a brothel worker. She said the fact that drug and alcohol drove people into survival sex workdid not mean that universal credit had not caused \u201ca really big influx\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is particularly bad with universal credit because we have seen these huge waits, but the whole welfare system is stacked against us and it is pushing people into survival sex work. \u201cIt is the long wait, it is the payments in particular that I think are really dangerous because when we apply for things like this we are in crisis already, like we don\u2019t have the ability to wait, and sex work is the only real job you can go out and earn money that night.\u201d T, a care worker, who went into escort work after using food banks during a six-week wait for her first universal credit payment, said: \u201cIt is horrible to say, but it is the easiest thing to keep us girls alive.\u201d Another witness, K, said she had worked out she would be \u00a3200 a month worse off on universal credit. \u201cI will sell my body. I want to tell this committee that there are a lot of girls out there just like me,\u201d she said. The committee also heard an unexpectedly positive, if qualified, endorsement of the recent report by the UN rapporteur Philip Alston, who last month called austerity cuts the \u201csystematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population\u201d. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, responded at the time by saying the report was politically biased. She alleged that Alston did not do enough research, having only visiting the UK for 11 days, and said the government would complain to the UN. Donna Ward, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) senior civil servant responsible for children, families and disadvantage, told the committee chair, Frank Field, that it had fact-checked Alston\u2019s report, which had in passing referred to a rise in survival sex. \u201cHe made a lot of good points. It was factually correct,\u201d she said. \u201cI think where the secretary of state took issue with it, and where I as a civil servant can\u2019t be involved, was the political interpretation of a lot of what\u2019s happened. \u201cBut in terms of the facts, in terms of austerity, cuts to local government, in terms of the reliance that we have on the labour market and the risks we face if there is a recession \u2013 all of those things were really good points that we have taken on board, and we should take on board.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
