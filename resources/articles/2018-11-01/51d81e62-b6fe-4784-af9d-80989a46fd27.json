There was even less swell than on the previous day, so we saw no time must be lost in landing more stores.\u201d The island is now known as Trindade, Portuguese for \u201ctrinity\u201d, and forms part of the Trindade and Martin Vaz archipelago off the coast of eastern Brazil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
