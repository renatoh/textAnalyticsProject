Care created two of the champions' three tries as they booked themselves a play-off place against Leicester at Welford Road on Saturday, hanging on at the end after establishing a 17-point lead. The scrum-half's reaction to being omitted by the Lions, not the only player to lose out to a bigger and more physical rival, was not to mope but to make a compelling case for being on the standby list. He set up the first try for Tom Williams with a clever chip that saw the covering Ben Foden beaten by a low bounce and created the third by taking a penalty quickly on the Northampton 22 and almost getting to the line. When Quins moved the ball right, an unmarked Tom Casson took the scoring pass that Williams had expected. \"I was disappointed when the Lions' squad was announced, but that is sport and you have to move on quickly,\" Care said. \"You need to get your head back on and Saturday was all about helping Harlequins win to set ourselves up for the following weekend.\" Leicester may have struggled in play-off finals in recent years but they have yet to be beaten in a semi-final. Quins have a better recent record against them than most: a league double this season followed last May's victory over the Premiership final at Twickenham and they have won three of their past four matches at Welford Road in all competitions. Care will be head-to-head with one of the players who was selected in his place by the Lions, his England colleague Ben Young. \"He is quality and we get on really well: I am sure there will be a bit of banter and as a team we are really looking forward to going there,\" Care said. \"We have had some really good games there recently and we back ourselves against anyone on our day.\" Quins finished the regular season strongly, three successive victories following a run of three straight defeats. \"We are excited by the challenge of Welford Road,\" said their director of rugby, Conor O'Shea, who will give Robshaw a fitness test this week with the England captain recovering from an ankle injury. \"We played well against Northampton apart from a 10-minute period in which we switched off, but we will need to be more accurate and ruthless against Leicester. Chris is hopeful of playing and when he starts pounding on his ankle we will know for sure. He is desperate to get out and play again and, like Danny, will not sulk because of missing out on the Lions. Other players will be getting on the plane for Australia who have not done as much as him.\" Northampton travel to Saracens on Sunday with a visiting team that are yet to win at Allianz Park. They finished the regular season having lost all six matches against the three teams above them, but they were within a try of winning all three games away, a combined deficit of eight points comparing to one of 47 at Franklin's Gardens. They opened out in the west London sunshine and their third try, scored by the second row Christian Day, was one of the best of the season, forwards and backs combining in an orgy of off-loading and slick handling that shattered the image of the Saints as a functional side that eschewed risk. It will be their fourth successive semi-final, but they have yet to make it to Twickenham. \"If we had beaten Harlequins, and it was a match that could have gone either way, there would have been a bit of hype around us but now it will be the normal 'the Saints can't do it, can't beat a top four side',\" said the Northampton director of rugby, Jim Mallinder. \"We are not going there worried about Saracens: they are difficult to beat, but on our day we are a really good team and I fancy us to score tries.\" Harlequins Brown; Williams (Chisholm, 65), Lowe, Casson, Monye; Evans (Botica, 62), Care (Dickson, 62); Marler (Lambert, 56), Buchanan (Gray, 51), Johnston (Collier, 68), Kohn (Matthews, 63), Robson, Guest (Fa'asavalu, 51), Wallace, Easter (capt).
