The former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich coaches will renew their rivalry next season when Guardiola replaces Manuel Pellegrini as the City manager. Klopp was fulsome in his praise of the Catalan following Monday\u2019s announcement, describing him as a \u201creally nice guy, really smart\u201d and one of the game\u2019s elite managers. Guardiola is on course to lift a third consecutive Bundesliga title with Bayern, having achieved the same feat at Barcelona between 2009 and 2011, but the Liverpool manager believes stronger competition will prevent him achieving such dominance in England. Asked whether Guardiola will bring success to City, Klopp said: \u201cI really wish all the people around the world the best of luck but we plan to avoid that! Manchester City is a club with not-too-bad possibilities on the financial side, shall we say, and Pep Guardiola is a really smart person. \u201cHe won\u2019t have chosen Man City because of his friendship with a few people there. They won\u2019t have the worst team in the world next year but I love football because that doesn\u2019t mean everything. As we have shown once or twice you can beat these teams. \u201cWe will see what happens but I cannot be interested in this now like everyone else is. I will see him for the first time maybe in July or August, that\u2019s a long time from now. He will enjoy the league because it is a great league and a real competition and he is a real competitor. That is what he wants. I don\u2019t think it will be the same situation as he had in Spain, with Barcelona on the top level, or in Germany with Bayern on the top level, but of course Man City has good possibilities. We will try to beat them.\u201d Liverpool visit Leicester City on Tuesdaywith the hosts\u2019 position at the Premier League summit underlining Klopp\u2019s argument. His first transfer window as the Liverpool manager closed without a deal for Alex Teixeira after Shakhtar Donetsk placed a \u20ac70m (\u00a353m) price on the Brazilian forward and refused to consider a sale in January. Klopp claimed he was not disheartened by the club\u2019s relative inactivity and urged supporters to trust his decision not to pay more than \u20ac32m for Teixeira. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you can trust us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a common decision on Teixeira. We said we can\u2019t play this game until the end. We made offers, I won\u2019t say too much about that, but they were realistic with the plusses of it being January, the Premier League, all the plusses you have when you make negotiations. But it was a case of: \u2018If you don\u2019t want it, OK, we can\u2019t change the situation, both for now and the future\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t got money but you have to work respectfully and responsibly. That\u2019s what we do. \u201cIt is not like you should buy and sell, buy and sell. In my opinion, usually I make a one-year contract with the players. I know they have longer contracts, but I say: \u2019Yes, if you don\u2019t play the biggest rubbish in your life, I will trust you, you have to trust me.\u2019 And after a year, maybe he wants somewhere else, maybe I want him to go somewhere else. That\u2019s football. Now in the middle of the season, I have been here for four months and nothing has happened on transfers. I am fine with that and we can go on working.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
