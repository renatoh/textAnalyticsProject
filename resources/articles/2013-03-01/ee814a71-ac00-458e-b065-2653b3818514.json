President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner sent a congratulatory message and wished the new pope well in pursuing \"justice, equality and fraternity\". However, she is known to have had a frosty relationship with Bergoglio, clashing over same-sex marriage and other issues. Her husband \u2013 the former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2013 described the archbishop as the \"true opposition,\" according to an article published in Clar\u00edn, the country's leading newspaper. There are reports too that contact soured several years ago after Bergoglio refused to express contrition for the Catholic Church's actions during the dictatorship era. Catholics account for 70 \u2013 89% of the 40.8 million population, though few of them are likely to have expected Bergoglio to be elected as the head of the church. His opportunity was thought to have been lost in 2005, when he was widely reported as the closest contender to Benedict XVI. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 March 2013. It originally reported that Bergoglio refused to express forgiveness for the Catholic Church's actions during the dictatorship era. It should have said he refused to express contrition. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
