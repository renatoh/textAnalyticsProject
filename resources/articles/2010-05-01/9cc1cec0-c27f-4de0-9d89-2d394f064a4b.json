This has been deleted as Sylvia Heal was not a focus of criticism for her record of expense claims as an MP, and hence is outside the subject matter of this article. Corrections published in the Guardian on 10 May 2010 \u2022\u2008We wrote about the awarding of the Templeton prize to Francisco J Ayala, geneticist, molecular biologist and former Dominican priest. The photo shown with the story on the web page was fine \u2013 but on the newspaper page the person pictured was the Spanish writer Francisco Ayala, who died last year aged 103 (Monk turned scientist wins \u00a31m spiritual dimension prize, 6 May, page 5). \u2022\u2008Reporting on a controversial Tesco plan to open another store in Bristol, a story said that the supermarket chain \"insists there is a demand and argues that 18 Tescos for a city of more than 400,000 people is not excessive\".

A search using the term Bristol on our store locator will give you 30 results. These include stores located in the neighbouring local authorities \u2013 Bath and North East Somerset and South Gloucestershire\" (Bristol's Tesco challenge: 17 stores in one hour, 18 March, page 2, G2). \u2022\u2008Our review of the Aston Martin Rapide (On the road, 1 May, page 75, Weekend), gave the car's top speed as 118mph.
