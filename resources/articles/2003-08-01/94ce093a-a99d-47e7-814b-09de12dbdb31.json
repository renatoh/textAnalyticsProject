Scholes is growing accustomed to these votes of confidence but there are signs he is becoming agitated by the most uncomfortable spell of an England career incorporating 57 caps and 13 goals. \"It is worrying me,\" he admitted. \"Scoring is a big part of my job, so if I am not scoring I am not doing my job properly.\" Nevertheless the plaudits keep coming. Otto Baric, Croatia's coach, revealed he is likely to play a five-man midfield to negate the threat posed by Scholes, Steven Gerrard and David Beckham. \"I think England's midfield is one of the strongest in the world,\" said Baric. \"That statistic [Scholes' barren international run] is quite incredible because every coach in the world would like a Scholes.\" Despite the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's criticisms of teams using multiple substitutions in friendly matches, Baric made it clear he would indulge in \"a night of experimentation\". With Croatia vying with Bulgaria and Belgium to qualify automatically for Euro 2004 from Group Eight, he added: \"It is OK for Sepp Blatter to say that, but it is my head on the block, not his. This is a friendly and my only chance to find out my best side.\" \u00b7 The Football Association has provisionally accepted an invitation from Croatia to play a return game as part of the build-up to Euro 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
