Her crime? A complaint to a neighbour about the volume of the call to prayer at her local mosque. Meiliana, who is Buddhist, was released last month on parole. Yet the fallout over the case remains. Not only did her objections lead to an anti-Chinese riot and the burning of several Buddhist temples in a country still riven by ethnic tensions; it reveals the damaging reach of Indonesia\u2019s controversial blasphemy law. Now the debate has made its way to Canberra \u2013 through art. In Wall of Tolerance \u2013 one of 50 plus works currently showing in Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) until October \u2013 a brick wall is peppered with gilded brass ears. At first the wall seems quiet. But lean in close and the ears emit the sounds of a call to prayer, recorded by artist Agus Suwage in his own neighbourhood. \u201cOne of the things you first hear in Indonesia is that incredible noise \u2013 you\u2019re relying on hearing as well as sight to navigate,\u201d says the NGA\u2019s Jaklyn Babington, who curated the exhibition. In Indonesia, the call to prayer, she adds, has become \u201cliterally a competition for airspace\u201d. Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia is an attempt to grow the NGA\u2019s networks and relationships in the Asia Pacific region. (More than half of the works, which span three generations of artists, have been acquired for its own collection.) But if Contemporary Worlds has a remit beyond a play for soft power with Australia\u2019s most important neighbour, it is to highlight the successes, tensions and fraught history of the world\u2019s third-largest democracy, a vast teeming nation of 260 million people. As Babington puts it, this is an exhibition about \u201csound and silence. What has been historically silenced is actually being vocalised now.\u201d That includes such state-organised violence as the Indonesian mass killings of the mid-1960s, which saw the army murder hundreds of thousands in an anti-communist purge, as well as the wholesale oppression in the same era of Indonesia\u2019s ethnic Chinese minority under the military dictator Suharto, who banned the public use of Mandarin and its teaching in schools. Addressing such injustices of the past is FX Harsono, a sixth-generation descendant of Chinese immigrants. Best known for his performance piece Writing in the Rain \u2013 in which the artist pens the characters of his Chinese name on a wall, only to see them washed away \u2013 Harsono has erected his work, Gazing on Collective Memory, at the NGA. A mass of electric candles hang from the ceiling, shining an otherworldly light onto wooden stands that hold photographs and schoolbooks. The installation is a powerful nod towards both the repression of a minority and the triumph of memory. Then there\u2019s Staging Collectivism by Jompet Kuswidananto, in which faceless, bodiless figures \u2013 suggested simply by veils and scattered shoes \u2013 are crammed together in the back of a beaten up truck. Below them dangle mechanical hands. The hands clap, but without sound. Referring to mass mobilisation in Indonesia, as well as the trucks that transported the victims of Suharto\u2019s anti-communist campaign to their deaths, the artwork is more about what is concealed than what is shown. Today, other issues are as pressing. From religious tolerance \u2013 a matter, as the blasphemy law shows, that is far from a given in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2013 to Indonesia\u2019s battle with pollution and rapid, too fast urbanisation. In her installation work, 1001st Island \u2013 The Most Sustainable Island in Archipelago, Jakarta-based Tita Salina has turned trash, literally, into art. Jakarta Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the world and, with rising sea levels, the city is rapidly sinking. Both factors put pressure on local fisherman due to declining fish populations. Addressing this, Salina has collected floating plastic and wrapped it in a fishing net to create her own \u201cisland\u201d, which she then released into the bay \u2013 the 1,001st of Jakarta\u2019s Thousand Islands. A net of plastic sits in the NGA, alongside a video where \u2013 defiant and alone, dressed all in black against a bleak industrial waterscape \u2013 Salina stands atop her manmade archipelago. Indeed, in Contemporary Worlds women take centre stage. No artist embodies this more than Melati Suryodarmo\u2019s durational performance Transaction of Hollows. In a blinding white room, 15 viewers at a time are invited in to watch Suryodarmo fire a bamboo arrow from a traditional Javanese bow. Over five hours, she fires 800 times \u2013 drawing and firing, drawing and firing. As the arrow hits the wall it produces a noise, akin to chanting. By the end she is bloodied and exhausted, as are the audience, who themselves become part of the meditation \u2013 an attempt to force us to slow down in an increasingly frenetic, transactional world. As the audience negotiates the space, Suryodarmo moves around them like a slow dance. They will just have to hope that she fires straight. \u2022 Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia is showing at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, until 27 October 2019.
