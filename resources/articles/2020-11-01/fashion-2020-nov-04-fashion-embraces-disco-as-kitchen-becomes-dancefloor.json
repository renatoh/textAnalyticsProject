Days before Kylie Minogue releases her new album, Disco, on Friday, John Lewis has unveiled its Christmas collection featuring a \u201ckitchen disco two-piece\u201d (a sparkly sweatshirt and joggers). The legendary Terry de Havilland label has announced its Disco collection featuring platform-heeled shoes in bold Studio 54 referencing colours. It follows mega brands such as Balenciaga, Oscar de la Renta and Etro, which all featured dancefloor-ready looks in their autumn/winter collections. Meanwhile, this season\u2019s couture collection from Valentino featured silver showgirl outfits that nodded to Donna Summer. \u201cWhen the world is at its most serious we [move towards] shallow pleasure,\u201d said the Grazia columnist Paul Flynn. For Terry de Havilland\u2019s label, the collection is a throwback to the start of disco. \u201cTerry\u2019s big break was in the 60s,\u201d said the brand\u2019s managing director, Darren Spurling, \u201cbut his first store in London\u2019s King\u2019s Road opened in 1972 and those iconic stacked platforms and high heels were the original disco trends of the 70s.\u201d The bedazzled look has been infiltrating the charts too, with R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy and Miley Cyrus referencing the haircuts and looks of Dolly Parton, Barbra Streisand and Debbie Harry from the era. And a week after Minogue\u2019s album, Sophie Ellis-Bextor releases Songs From the Kitchen Disco. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about the fundamental need to provide catharsis and escapism from the daily anxiety of a potentially killer virus and the weight of the news,\u201d said Ellis Bextor. The idea for her album came from the kitchen discos she and her family had during the first lockdown. \u201cWe all felt like we needed dancing and music to lift our spirits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not disco as a genre, but disco dancing that felt like the right tonic for the soul to see us through these heavy days.\u201d Originally, disco, which began in the fringes of American society in gay clubs and featured a racially diverse crowd, was a reaction to the mainstream. \u201cThe roots of disco lay in American youths\u2019 disillusionment with the political class,\u201d said Prof Andrew Groves, course director at the University of Westminster. \u201cThe Vietnam war, the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King and JFK, all of these led to a societal disconnect that manifested in disco being fundamentally a rejection of the reality of the day, a Bacchanalian embrace of the artificiality of the night.\u201d Groves believes there is a parallel with today\u2019s revival of disco and the rigidity of 2020\u2019s governmental rules. \u201cWithin this context, to dress up, to dance once again becomes a profound act of political resistance,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
