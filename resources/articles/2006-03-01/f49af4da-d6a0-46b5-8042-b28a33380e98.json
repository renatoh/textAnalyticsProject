Tickets for England matches are being sold online from non-official sources but buyers are being told to beware of the black market. Official World Cup tickets do not exist yet and will only be dispatched six to eight weeks before the tournament, so you will, in effect, be paying a tout for a promise. If you do obtain a ticket this way then you still could be refused access to the stadium, as each ticket will have the official ticket holders' name on it and ID will be required to verify that you are the ticketholder. With tickets being sold online at close to \u00a3900 the risks involved are too great. Our travel guide should ease your journey to Germany and help you soak up an atmosphere that can only be found once every four years.
