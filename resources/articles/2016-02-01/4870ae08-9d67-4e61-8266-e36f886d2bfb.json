He had enough experience to steady the ship but doubts centred on the squad he inherited this time round and whether last season\u2019s champions had the strength of character to recover. Retreat to his previous stint in charge and this club had built their revival post Luiz Felipe Scolari on the power and presence of Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, Michael Ballack and John Terry, Didier Drogba and Ashley Cole. The concern, expressed publicly by Hiddink on more than one occasion, centred on whether the current crop, bolstered by only three survivors from 2009, were blessed with the same natural born leaders to rally. A little over 10 weeks on from the divorce with Mourinho, the 69-year-old has his answer. This was their most impressive result yet, a game where they might have wilted earlier in the campaign while Southampton were the dominant force, only to rally late on and offer evidence of spirit, stubborn self-belief and resilience: qualities more readily associated with recent Chelsea teams. Branislav Ivanovic, the stand-in captain for an injured Terry but such a liability earlier in the campaign, was more recognisable from previous years and headed in the late winner from a corner. Diego Costa riled, bullied and infuriated his markers but also chased, harried and hassled. Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Oscar eventually imposed their influence and Eden Hazard was industrious at both ends. Figures who had crawled into their shells as Mourinho\u2019s tenure unravelled have been galvanised, reminded both of their underlying qualities as well as immediate responsibilities. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m happy players like F\u00e0bregas are doing their job, so it\u2019s good to see that some players step up, not just in their personal performance but also organising tactically,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cWith Ivanovic, he\u2019s not a big shouter but he does deliver the short commands. As a manager, I want what we do in training and team meetings to be executed by my key players. He helps that but he\u2019s not alone. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta does a lot also in the [on-field] coaching. Diego, in his own way, does a lot of coaching. I like Oscar, Willian \u2026 these guys who are gifted by nature but also take command in this team.\u201d This win was a reward for players and management, Hiddink having taken the bold \u2013 if also brutal \u2013 decision to hook Baba Rahman from the fray at the interval after the young full-back presented Shane Long and Southampton with the lead their excellent first-half display had merited. Kenedy, the Ghanaian\u2019s replacement, will surely start at Norwich City on Tuesday when Terry is also unlikely to be considered. Ronald Koeman takes his team down the coast to Bournemouth and will do so far from panicked, despite a first defeat in seven weeks and the shipping of their first goals for more than 10-and-a-half hours. \u201cI\u2019m not a person who is disappointed to lose a game like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a good run but if we win the next game we\u2019ll be back in the position we want to be in. It is all about the spirit of the team and, if we can keep that with the quality of the players we have, then we can finish in a high position.\u201d Certainly, their rare strength in depth was demonstrated by the quality of those on the hosts\u2019 bench. The state of Long\u2019s hamstring is a concern before the derby at Dean Court, the Irishman having limped off while his team still led on Saturday, but this team should not be perturbed by a slender defeat. Even so, Chelsea, with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and an FA Cup quarter-final at Everton to come, can be hugely encouraged in victory.
