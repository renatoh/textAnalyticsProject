Many of these children are at risk of physical, sexual or psychological abuse by adults looking after them or in contact with them. They are entirely dependent on the courts for protection. If the wrong decision is made a child will be left in or returned to the care of potential abusers, sometimes with fatal consequences. Child witnesses have long complained that they are not well served by the legal system. Younger children in particular do not understand the terminology or proceedings of the courts and often find them a hostile and disorientating environment. The creation of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) in April 2001 was meant to make the legal process simpler and less threatening by bringing together three bodies that respectively dealt with the possible removal of children from their families into local authority care (public law), divorce proceedings (private law), and extremely complex wardship or adoption cases. But two years later the agency is under investigation by the Commons select committee on the Lord Chancellor's Department amid charges by lawyers, judges and children's charities that it has left hundreds of vulnerable children in serious danger of harm. The main responsibility of Cafcass is to manage the work of expert welfare officers, known as guardians, who represent children in family court proceedings and protect their best interests. Guardians were first appointed following the inquiry into the death of seven-year-old Maria Colwell - starved and beaten by her stepfather in 1973 after being returned home with the approval of a Brighton court. Experienced child protection social workers with expertise in family law, they have often uncovered crucial evidence proving that children are being abused. Prior to Cafcass, guardians had to be appointed within 24 hours and in some areas of the country this happened in 95% of cases. But 200 of the most experienced officers quit within months of the agency's launch following an acrimonious dispute about their terms and conditions. As a result a huge backlog of cases rapidly built up. The latest figures show there were 576 public law cases unallocated in April. According to the Law Society, children are waiting up to 15 weeks for court hearings on their futures because of a shortage of guardians and care proceedings are taking an average of 91 weeks to complete. These delays mean that children at great risk of abuse remain under the same roof as adults who are the potential abusers for longer. Two children have died in recent months while waiting for guardians to be allocated to protect them. In the first case the parents of a 10-month-old boy from Plymouth have been charged with child cruelty. In the second case, the parents of a child who died in Birmingham have been charged with murder. Meanwhile other children already removed from their homes and place into care are needlessly being separated from their families, which can significantly damage their bond with their parents and siblings. The worst backlog is in Greater London where there are now a record 205 public cases unallocated. Of these, 70 are classified as priority cases, where the children are particularly young or have been abused or neglected. The inner London family proceedings court, which hears 7% of children's cases in England, currently has 76 public cases unallocated - a rise of 20 in a month. This includes the case of three eastern European immigrant children, temporarily placed with foster parents because their mother's partner had allegedly sexually abused them, who asked to come home after waiting months for a guardian. Delays in private custody cases are nearly as bad. Officially only 365 private law cases are not assigned but according to the family court union, Napo, the figure is nearer 1,200 because Cafcass discounts those unallocated for under six to eight weeks. Delays in the hearing of parental contact disputes have risen to 18 weeks, meaning thousands of children are left in legal limbo amid protracted rows between their parents. Cafcass has hired hundreds more staff to clear the backlog in the past year. But many of the new recruits have been criticised for lacking the skills to handle the complexities of their cases. Some have almost no experience of social work or the legal system. Inner London district, Judge Nicholas Crichton, warned the Lord Chancellor's select committee that an increasing number of guardians appeared to be \"out of their depth\". The charity NCH said children in divorce cases were frequently dissatisfied with new family court officers, complaining that their feelings were being \"unheard or misrepresented\". Responsibility for Cafcass has been transferred from the Lord Chancellor's Department to the new children's minister, Margaret Hodge, at the Department for Education and Skills. Welfare and legal experts hope that this will enable the agency to work more effectively with children's social services and family support services. Urgent action is required as the new Adoption and Children Act 2002 is expected to add another 5,000 cases a year to the guardians' workload. Pat Monro of the Association of Lawyers for Children warned the select committee that until Cafcass could meet its core responsibilities \"it would be a recipe for utter disaster for it to take on anything else.\" Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, said: \"The work of court welfare officers is more complex than ever. Most cases now involve accusations of abuse, neglect or emotional damage. As long as the backlog of cases continues the risk of another child abuse scandal remains unacceptably high.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
