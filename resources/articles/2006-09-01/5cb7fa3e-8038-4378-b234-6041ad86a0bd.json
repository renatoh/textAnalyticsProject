Racing's rulers are right to press trainers to be more frank with the betting public but we punters should still work on the premise that the only information worth having is not available. I wouldn't have backed Fonthill Road even if I'd heard the whole \"had his back fixed by a genius vet\" shtick before the race. I was sure he was drawn on the wrong side - so Mr Fahey wasn't the only one who showed himself up on Saturday. In hindsight, the clues were there. The market is not an infallible guide but Fonthill Road was joint-fifth in the morning lists at 16-1, much lower than was justified by his recent form and apparently poor stalls position, so the high street firms were clearly aware that he might bounce back to his best. Our own Horse Sense had passed on word earlier this month that connections felt the six-year-old was in line for a \"fruitful autumn\". Bottom line - this puzzle was solvable. Those of us who lost are better off learning the lessons than expecting more glasnost from the training fraternity. Royal Ascot winner Sir Gerard is reported unlikely to run in next month's Cambridgeshire, for which he had been as low as 7-1. Smart Enough is now clear favourite at 11-2 with Hill's. For the notebook Dansili Dancer 1m2f Newbury Pinpoint got all the plaudits for landing this Cambridgeshire trial but Dansili Dancer put up a great effort to be fourth, beaten a length and a half, after racing more promintently than the first three. A furlong less at Newmarket will be ideal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
