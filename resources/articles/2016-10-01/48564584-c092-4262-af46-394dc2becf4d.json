The move came as manufacturer Whirlpool faced fresh calls to change its advice for consumers owning faulty tumble dryers and urgently take them out of use, after a London fire brigade report concluded that a faulty Indesit machine was the cause of a recent serious tower block blaze in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Following a six-week investigation, fire chiefs confirmed that the dryer was behind the August blaze, which ripped through part of the 18-storey block in West London and took 120 firefighters to control. Following the completion of the independent report - and as part of the London fire brigade\u2019s Total Recalls campaign which aims to make white goods safer - fire chiefs renewed their call for the dryer\u2019s parent company Whirlpool to change its advice to consumers. They also warned of the lack of a robust national system of product recalls in emergency situations. The report\u2019s findings have piled fresh pressure on Whirlpool, nearly a year after it admitted that the fire fault exists in some models, caused when excess fluff touches the heating element. However, it did not issue a product recall, insisting that people may continue to use the affected dryers while they are waiting for them to be \u201cmodified\u201d \u2013 provided they are not left unattended. The company is in the process of replacing or repairing more than 5m potentially faulty machines across the UK, under the brand names Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda and Proline. On Wednesday, after months of pressure from fire authorities, MPs and consumer groups, the consumer minister, Margot James, said: \u201cCustomer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers. I acknowledge that Whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace at-risk machines, but I believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public. I will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations.\u201d James said she was also creating a new working group on product recalls and safety \u201cto look at what more can be done to improve the safety of white goods, including tumble dryers\u201d. \u201cThis fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be,\u201d said Dave Brown, London fire brigade\u2019s director of operations. \u201cDisappointingly though, Whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers. We are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own. Thankfully there were no serious injuries in the Shepherd\u2019s Bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again.\u201d More than 100 families were evacuated from the Shepherd\u2019s Bush blaze, with 26 being found temporary accommodation in hotels. Nine families, including the Defreitas family \u2013 who lived in the flat where the blaze started \u2013 are still unable to return home. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, has repeatedly urged the government to stand up for the safety of the public and force Whirlpool to modify its advice. \u201cNow that the London fire brigade has confirmed what everyone suspected, that this is yet another fire caused by defective Whirlpool tumble dryers, the manufacturers must act immediately to take these dangerous machines out of use,\u201d he said. There are fears that the faulty machines made by Whirlpool could be just the tip of the iceberg, and the Local Government Association, which represents all fire authorities, claims three incidents a day are caused by tumble dryers in England and Wales. At Birmingham coroner\u2019s court in August, an inquest was told that a make of tumble dryer from a different manufacturer, Beko, which caused a fire that killed a mother of two, had been involved in 20 previous reported blazes. Mishell Moloney, aged 49, was found dead after being overcome by carbon monoxide fumes and smoke caused by a small fire in her tumble dryer. Beko\u2019s director of quality, Andrew Mullen, said a decision not to recall the model was taken only after a risk assessment and a consultation with trading standards officers. Whirlpool said in a statement on Wednesday: \u201cOur thoughts are with all those affected by the incident in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, London, in August 2016. \u201cWhile we understand that London fire brigade has concluded its investigation into the incident, Whirlpool\u2019s independent forensic investigations are still ongoing and in the circumstances, it would be inappropriate to comment further. The safety of consumers is our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the tumble dryer modification programme is carried out in a safe and timely manner. We continue to cooperate fully with the relevant regulatory authority (Peterborough trading standards) as progress is regularly monitored and reviewed.\u201d Tom Jervis, of solicitors Leigh Day, said he was acting for the Defreitas family and four other families living in the block whose homes suffered the worst damage, along with other victims of related tumble dryer fires across the UK, and preparing legal action against Whirlpool. \u201cWe are bringing a product liability case \u2013 under the terms of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 \u2013 on the grounds that the affected machines are allegedly defective,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a possible group action that would allow other people to join, but we are urging the company to change its advice so that \u2026 human life is not being put at risk by any further fires.\u201d Alex Neill, managing director of home and legal services at consumer group Which?, said: \u201cAlmost a year on, there are still millions of potentially dangerous tumble dryers in people\u2019s homes. London fire brigade\u2019s investigation into the Shepherd\u2019s Bush fire highlights the urgent need for the government to review the Whirlpool case and set out how it is going to improve safety for affected customers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
