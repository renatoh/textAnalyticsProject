Since its launch in 2004 it's led to 76 new works and given a boost to dance-makers including Rafael Bonachela, Bawren Tavaziva and Hofesh Shechter. But this week the last four works of the 2010-11 competition enter the finals stage. They cover styles from the comic vaudeville tackiness of Ben Duke and Raquel Meseguer's It Needs Horses to the playful intimacy of Freddie Opoku-Addaie and Frauke Redqardt's duet Fidelity Project; the film noir pastiche of Riccardo Buscarini and Antonio de le Fe Guedes's Cameo to the absurdist ritual of Eva Recacha's Begin To Begin. This finals stage is fun for attendees, who get to vote for who should receive the Audience Prize (\u00a31,000). After the last performance, the panel of judges then awards the Place Prize itself, plus \u00a325,000. The Place, WC1, Wed to 16 Apr Mariinsky Ballet: Giselle In 3D, Nationwide Sneaking in before the UK release of Pina (Wim Wenders's tender, magnificent 3D homage to the work of Pina Bausch) comes this big-screen version of the Mariinsky's Giselle. Although its claim to be the world's first 3D ballet isn't exactly true (Sky Arts launched a 3D dance season last autumn), it should still be a fascinating development in the rapid advance of cinema dance. To see the spectral ranks of Wilis in real depth and watch the drama of Giselle's love and betrayal unfold close up promises to be a thrilling alternative to the live theatrical experience. Some may query the Mariinsky's decision not to cast one of its own in the title role, opting instead to use the Bolshoi's Natalia Osipova as guest star. Phenomenal as her Giselle is, Osipova may look stylistically at odds with the rest of the Mariinsky cast. Various venues and dates, visit more2screen.com A Flash Of Light: Chris Nash, London Chris Nash has been photographing dancers and choreographers for three decades and this retrospective of his work documents both dance history and Nash's own development as a photographer. Nash was rarely content just to focus on the shape and movement of the dancing body. Using collage techniques, surreal juxtapositions and experiments with light and composition, he captures a deeper sense of the choreographic aesthetic, or a dancer's personality, along with the actual movement material being portrayed. A Flash Of Light reflects the range of companies and artists with whom he's worked, including the Rambert and Cholmondeleys, and a specially commissioned film captures Nash at work.
