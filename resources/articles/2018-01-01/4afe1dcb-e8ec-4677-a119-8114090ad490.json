It was September of last year and the screamer put Arsenal in control against Bournemouth at the Emirates. They would win 3-0. Two Premier League games later, Lacazette was on target again, scoring twice in Arsenal\u2019s 2-0 home victory over West Brom. At that point, the club\u2019s record signing had four goals in six league appearances, having marked his debut in the competition with one after two minutes in the 4-3 home win over Leicester City. He was flying. The France striker has now hit a lull and it is a moment to test him. Since his goals against West Brom, he has scored only four times in 17 club matches and, as he prepares to face Bournemouth once more \u2013 on Sunday lunchtime at the Vitality Stadium \u2013 he is in the throes of an eight-game drought. \u201cThis guy is used to scoring 30 goals per year so, at the moment, even if he says no, I am sure he is frustrated,\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger says. \u201cIt certainly affects him a little bit but I\u2019m not worried. It will come back and it\u2019s in cycles. At the moment, he\u2019s going through a cycle that is a bit more frustrating for him.\u201d Lacazette has been assaulted by culture shock on every level since his \u00a352.7m transfer from Lyon last July. Wenger spoke in August about how the city of Lyon was a \u201cspecial place\u201d and it produced players with \u201ctheir own mentality\u201d. The Arsenal manager continued: \u201cThey don\u2019t like to move away, usually. They produce their own players, the players who grew up around Lyon, like Fekir, Lacazette, Gonalons. They usually like to stay there. I did not know whether they wanted to move or not. It is a very specific French player at Lyon.\u201d The switch to England was always going to present its challenges for Lacazette \u2013 who moved relatively late for a Ligue 1 star at the age of 26 \u2013 among them the language, although he has been helped by the presence of a handful of compatriots including his France team-mates Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult period because the family comes over and it\u2019s a bit less football-orientated,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cI think the fact he lives here with French players and can speak French when needed, and that Lyon is not too far, is OK. But the first six months are always difficult.\u201d It is on the field where Lacazette has been walloped. Had he stayed at Lyon, he would have enjoyed two weeks off over Christmas and New Year. During the same period at Arsenal, he started four Premier League fixtures. Wenger admitted that Lacazette was \u201cnot at his best\u201d in physical terms before Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final at Chelsea and his performance was blunt. He skied a good chance in the 0-0 draw and was substituted midway through the second half. Lacazette was asked to plough a lonely furrow at Stamford Bridge, working to close down defenders, and it has been a common theme for him away from home \u2013 where Arsenal have regularly failed to impose themselves. \u201cThe physical pressure on strikers in England has become absolutely massive,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cThe physical demands and the intensity in the challenges is much bigger than in France. In England, you play against teams who are organised and can physically cope with 90 minutes\u2019 intensity. The defenders are much quicker than before. They are all athletes now at the back. \u201cAs a striker, you have to provoke. At the back, you respond. So that means the intensity and the problems for the defender have to come always from you. The defender can sometimes respond to the situation with experience but the striker has always to be provocative. You need a lot of energy for that.\u201d Wenger noted how the frenetic festive schedule was a surprise to overseas players \u2013 \u201cThe body needs to get used to it; the mind, as well,\u201d he says \u2013 and he estimated that most of them needed a year to acclimatise to English football, even the biggest names. Paul Pogba\u2019s travails at Manchester United last season, after the France midfielder\u2019s transfer from Juventus, were not lost on Wenger \u2013 and this was a player who spent his formative years at Old Trafford. \u201cPogba looks settled now, he dominates physically,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cIn the first year, yes, you can suffer a little bit.\u201d Lacazette\u2019s ability to cope with the physicality of the Premier League was always likely to be a problem but Wenger believes he is getting there. \u201cHe has worked to cope with the intensity of the challenges,\u201d the Arsenal manager says. \u201cIn France, you go down and it\u2019s a free-kick. In England, you go down and it\u2019s no free-kick. That is much more difficult for the striker to get used to. I think he resists better.\u201d Where Lacazette has impressed is with the sharpness of his movement, particularly his spins inside the box, his pace and his technique. Wenger also referenced \u201cthe quality of his understanding with the other players\u201d. What Lacazette needs now is another goal against Bournemouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
