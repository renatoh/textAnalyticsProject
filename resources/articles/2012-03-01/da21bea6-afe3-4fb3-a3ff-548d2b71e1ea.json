Allegations centre on the way the twins wrested control of the parent firm from a group of Irish entrepreneurs, who had bought the company in an aggressively debt-fuelled deal eight years ago. One of the investors, property developer Paddy McKillen, who was outmanoeuvred by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay in a race to win control of the \u00a31bn hotels business last year, is claiming at the high court in London that the reclusive twins improperly paid \"very substantial sums\" to the wife of a fellow shareholder, Derek Quinlan, to help win control. The Barclays admitted making payments to the Quinlan family but insist these were separate from dealings concerning the hotels business, all of which were properly conducted. \"Helping the Quinlan family at their time of need is something I would never regret,\" Sir Frederick said in a witness statement. He has also said he is not prepared to give evidence in court. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector, had been one of the leading lights in Ireland's credit and property boom but much of his empire collapsed after Ireland's 2008 banking crash. His shares in Coroin, the company behind the luxury hotels, had been pledged to banks for more than their value, meaning their eventual sale would not have generated a profit for him, McKillen's lawyers told the court. \"He was looking for a side deal, some kind of other way he could receive a significant payment, before he would enter into a deal with any particular purchaser. And that is exactly what he did with the Barclay brothers.\" McKillen believed he had first rights to buy Quinlan's shares under an agreement between the original investors. There is no dispute that repeated transfers were made from Barclay, who had acquired a holding in Coroin, to Quinlan's family. The brothers insist they have been friends with the Quinlans since 2005 and note that, in better times, the Irish businessman had made generous donations to charitable enterprises in which the Barclay family had a personal interest. Quinlan, who is expected to give evidence, is expected to tell the court the brothers have for some time been meeting the living expenses of his family, who now live in Putney, south-west London. On the opening day of what is expected to be a bitter and lengthy court battle, Lord Grabiner QC, counsel for the Barclays, sought to turn the tables on the brothers' accusers, claiming McKillen had failed to come to terms with his reduced means. Grabiner said the three hotels, together with the Savoy, which was later sold off, had been acquired by four men, led by Quinlan, \"riding a wave of cheap and easy Irish credit\" in 2004. A picture was painted of a business in dire straits, unable to cope with its borrowings, until the Barclays came to the rescue. McKillen is later expected to tell the court that but for the Barclay's \"unlawful\" intervention he was poised to take control of the business and refinance its excessive debts. His lawyers invited the judge to draw a negative inference from the refusal of both Barclay brothers to attend court and have their evidence tested under cross-examination. A medical letter noting Sir David Barclay was suffering from angina appeared to be contradicted by other correspondence, they said. Grabiner said: \"What McKillen does not want or like is that he may be squeezed out of Coroin because he cannot afford to stay in \u2013 ie, pay the sums required to put Coroin on a sound financial footing. Sir Frederick and Sir David cannot be held responsible for this. It is a fact of life that if you want to be a shareholder of a company with a value approaching \u00a31bn, but you have no money, you are likely to lose out in the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
