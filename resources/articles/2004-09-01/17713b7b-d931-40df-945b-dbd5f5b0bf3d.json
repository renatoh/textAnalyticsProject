The Pemba Action Group, consisting of some of the victims and their parents, says youngsters could be at risk as the trade association Year Out Group does not thoroughly check that members follow codes of practice. Some of the 24 people attacked on a diving expedition with London-based Frontier in July were beaten, sexually assaulted, and two were shot, but survived. Both Year Out Group and PAG are investigating the incident, but so far there is no suggestion that Frontier was at fault. The campaign focuses on YOG, a self-regulatory body formed five years ago by some of the UK's leading gap-year trip providers, to help students plan trips with reliable organisations and to monitor its 30 members and ensure they follow an agreed code of conduct. Action group chairman Ian Forster, whose daughter was shot during the pirate attack, warned those about to take a gap year not to rely on YOG recommendations, as members were not thoroughly monitored. Founder YOG member, Peter Raines, who received an MBE last year for conservation work with volunteers and runs member company Coral Cay Conservation, said: 'Once companies become members there's no assurance they abide by the code. Since it started I have never been asked to provide evidence I abide by the code.' Year Out Group chairman Richard Oliver said that members had to confirm biannually that they followed the code, and that annual checks would be brought in next year. 'We don't have the resources to check everything, the companies are independent and the duty of care is with them. Young people should thoroughly research their trip to find the right organisation.' The founder of Gapyear.com, Tom Griffiths, said: 'The YOG is wrongly perceived as a government organisation as its website shows comments from Ucas and the Department of Education. We need an industry-wide regulatory body that looks after young people, not its members. The YOG set out to do that but has become a trade tool.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
