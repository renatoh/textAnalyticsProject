After a clean sweep of domestic trophies in a staggering 2018-19 campaign, and after claiming five of the last six competitions available in England, only Europe needs to be conquered by Pep Guardiola and his juggernaut team. The manager knows it. At a Lionel Messi-led Barcelona, Guardiola guided his boyhood club to European Cup wins in 2009 and 2011. The Catalan has managed seven times in the continent\u2019s blue riband club tournament since and failed to win it again: once with Bar\u00e7a, three with Bayern Munich and three with City. The equation is simple for Guardiola to identify and weigh up. After claiming the last two League Cups and this season\u2019s FA Cup with Saturday\u2019s 6-0 trouncing of Watford, next season is surely the moment to forget pursuing these lesser trophies and instead marshal the extra physical and mental energy required for a tilt at a triumphant Champions League campaign. The Watford victory was game number 61 for City in a season that started in August. They fell only three short of the maximum number of fixtures possible. \u201cI know we will be judged at the end on whether we win the Champions League,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cI know unless we do that it will not be enough. This comes with me [my profile], I know that. I arrive in Barcelona, we were lucky we won it two times in four years, and the people expect I am something special that we have to win the Champions League and it\u2019s still true. \u201cIn this club, the points record [100 in 2017-18] and the domestic competitions is incredible, but the Champions League we don\u2019t win because the teams are so good, the competition is so demanding, but we want to win it.\u201d In the three attempts under Guardiola, City have faltered twice at the quarter-final stage and once in the last 16. Last month, Tottenham eliminated them on away goals after a late VAR decision at the Etihad ruled out what would have been a winning goal from Raheem Sterling. Guardiola often cites \u201cdecisions by inches\u201d as the difference in the competition\u2019s late rounds. Yet given how dominant City are, how deep their squad is (Leroy San\u00e9, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Ag\u00fcero were all on the bench for Saturday\u2019s final, with the latter not even getting on to the pitch), Guardiola might calculate he can shift the decisive margins in his favour by ensuring all his A-listers are fresh when the business end of the Champions League arrives. The manager\u2019s intended recruitment this close season is designed to make his team more capable of getting through the rigours of a quarter-final or semi\u2011final. Vincent Kompany may have announced he will leave after 11 years but Guardiola would have pursued a new centre-back regardless as he believes City are not dominant enough in the air and lack defensive pace through the middle. Fernandinho\u2019s age and the absence of a natural deputy for the 34-year-old Brazilian makes a defensive midfielder another key recruit this summer. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Rodri is in the frame, and if Benjamin Mendy can also stay fit for next season, having failed to do so in each of his previous two, Guardiola will, in effect, have three new and high-class squad additions. City\u2019s dominance on the home front may turn off neutrals and opposing fans, but this is really not their concern. For Guardiola and his players the pursuit of excellence, the challenge of taking themselves and the club to the next level, is all. He is in no doubt what they need to do next. \u201cContinue to try to play good and to arrive at the last stages of competitions fighting,\u201d the manager said after Saturday\u2019s rout. \u201cThat is what I want, that is my target for the next season, to keep this spirit in this group.\u201d Guardiola admits to being tired but remains desperately hungry. \u201cYeah, of course. I wouldn\u2019t be here next season unless I believed we could improve as a group. I know it will be difficult because people will compare and people cannot expect us to repeat the treble or four titles in one season [including the Community Shield]. That is something one team does once in their lifetime. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly happy, exhausted, and that is the truth. I\u2019m so tired, but I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m calm and our fans were incredible and satisfied. Looking forward I will keep my energy a little for Monday to do our parade [in the city centre] and our last party of the season with our people and then go on our holidays. That is what is in my mind. I\u2019m not focused, believe me, at the start of the season thinking: \u2018I have to win one title, two, three or four\u2019 \u2013 never.\u201d Equally he knows that next season is about vanquishing all-comers on the European stage. It simply must be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
