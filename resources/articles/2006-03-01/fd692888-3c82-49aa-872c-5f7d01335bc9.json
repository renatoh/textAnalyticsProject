But check out akihabaranews.com for the piccies of Sony's new recorder, designed specifically for PSP users: \"The MSVR-A10 is a Mr reader/recorder that supports the MPEG-4 AVC(H.264) format and encodes the video straight onto the MS in 320x240, which gives you between 2h20 and 4h10 of video on a 1GB MS (depending on the compression).\" Can't see this one hitting UK shelves anytime soon. Or indeed, ever. But it's quite cute, isn't it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
