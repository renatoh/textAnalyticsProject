Almost a century after the Egyptian king\u2019s tomb was first cracked open by a British-led expedition, and 47 years after crowds queued for hours outside the British Museum to catch a glimpse of its contents, a new exhibition will once again showcase the astonishing riches that were buried to accompany the Egyptian king into the afterlife more than 3,300 years ago. Of course the real Tutankhamun, who died around 1,326BC, was never a diva past his prime, having lived, married, ruled and died all before his 20th birthday. But the boy king now finds himself obliged to take another turn on the world stage for motives which, as Egypt\u2019s minister of antiquities Khaled El-Anany acknowledged on Friday, are financial as much as cultural. The new London exhibition, staged to a moody musical backdrop at the Saatchi gallery by the global sport and entertainment promoter IMG, is the third stop in a 10-city world tour whose purpose, El-Anany volunteered with admirable frankness, was \u201cpromotion of Egypt. And to motivate tourists to come to Egypt.\u201d The country has seen an alarming slump in visitor numbers in recent decades thanks to turbulent politics, including the 2011 revolution and the unrest that followed, and a number of devastating terrorist attacks. The 2015 bombing of a Russian tourist jet over the Sinai peninsula led to the suspension of all flights between the UK and Sharm el-Sheikh \u2013 British Foreign Office restrictions on travel to the area were lifted only last month. And thus, said El-Anany: \u201cWe are sending a very few of the treasures that we have, like a teaser for tourists all over the world, to motivate them to come back.\u201d To the voluble Zawi Hawass, one of Egypt\u2019s most eminent archaeologists, the purpose is even more plain. \u201cEgypt\u2019s name will be every day for six months in the TV or newspaper. And it brings money to Egypt.\u201d King Tut\u2019s pitstop in Paris earlier this year \u2013 the second leg of the tour after Los Angeles \u2013 became the most popular exhibition in France\u2019s history and raised $10m for Egypt, Hawass noted. The money will be spent on the enormous and much-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum project in Giza, which authorities insist will finally open late next year. All of which may explain the London ticket prices, which will set you back almost \u00a3120 for a family of four on a weekend visit \u2013 that\u2019s before audio guides, programmes or a brief but illuminating VR \u201cexperience\u201d for which tickets are sold separately. The world\u2019s most classy trade stall this may be, but even in the absence of the king\u2019s most famous artefacts \u2013 Tutankhamun\u2019s spectacular gold death mask and three gold coffins are barred by Egyptian law from leaving the country \u2013 this remains a breathtaking collection. There is plenty of bling, of course \u2013 from the gilded wooden representations of the boy king steering a ship or riding a panther or hunting lions, to the spectacular solid gold chains and rings and pectoral ornaments, which were laid on his body and folded into his mummy wrappings. An exquisite gold and carnelian coffinette, barely 40cm tall and made to house his mummified liver, evokes his funerary mask on a diminutive scale. But the exhibition also contains items that come closer to capturing the humanity of the teenager behind the mask, including a tiny wooden chair which the curator, Tarek El Awady, said was likely to be the throne on which the nine-year-old Tutankhamun was crowned, and a collection of plainly painted wooden boxes, one shaped like a chicken carcass, into which were packed cuts of meat to feed the king on his journey to the afterlife. So spectacular are the riches at the country\u2019s disposal, indeed, that it is hard to believe Egypt will be able to resist the temptation in future to take the treasures of Tutankhamun on the road again, whatever their marketing-led vows are now. But Hawass insisted \u2013 \u201cWe are 100% certain, yes\u201d \u2013 that King Tut\u2019s treasures will never again be seen outside Egypt once the Grand Museum finally opens. \u201cTutankhamun is tired. He has to relax at home. He has to go home and drink some nice beer and live at home for a long time.\u201d Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh is at the Saatchi Gallery from 2 November 2019 \u2013 3 May 2020. www.tutankhamun-london.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
