But I did rehab on it, hit all my targets, strapped it and managed to play Australia and Uruguay with no dramas, really. When I got back to Bath, they had a little play with it and organised a scan. In fact, I had only about a third of my pec still attached.\u201d It sounds dramatic, but Joseph is adamant that the discomfort was only slight. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I didn\u2019t really feel it. I was aware of it, but I could still tackle on it. It was obviously heavily strapped, but it was a World Cup. I was going to do everything I could to play.\u201d Bath organised an operation immediately and announced in mid-October that the England centre would be out for around three months, which would have been cutting it fine for the Six Nations. Happily, though, he has staged a remarkable recovery. \u201cThe first date was 9 January,\u201d said Mike Ford, Bath\u2019s director of rugby, \u201cthen it was 27 December, then the second Wasps game [in Europe next weekend] and then the first Wasps game [on Sunday] \u2013 and then he came back last week. He\u2019s healed and rehabbed really well. And he\u2019s been desperate to play.\u201d Joseph\u2019s return to the team last Saturday was more than a month ahead of schedule. Although in a losing cause against Northampton, he sent Semesa Rokoduguni away for a fine try with the sort of flat pass for which he is becoming known as much as his more recognised qualities. \u201cHe has that outside break,\u201d said Ford, \u201cbut his passing skills are sublime. Where he\u2019s growing is in his Conrad Smith-style understanding of the game. That\u2019s where he can develop. Without question, there\u2019s a lot more to come. He\u2019s a baby.\u201d Joseph\u2019s return is some good news for Eddie Jones to compensate for the loss of Henry Slade to long-term injury. Slade and Joseph had finished the World Cup as England\u2019s centre pairing, the kind of pacy, skilful combination that many hope might represent the future. \u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t have too great a World Cup,\u201d said Joseph, \u201cso it\u2019s almost like a clean slate. It\u2019s a new set of coaches. I haven\u2019t spoken to Eddie yet. I don\u2019t know what he likes, or whether he likes me, so I\u2019ll concentrate on myself and put my best foot forward if I get selected. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a lot of hurt from the World Cup and use it as a driving force. We do need to come into this Six Nations ready to put in the graft, but also to have a bit of confidence about us. We know we\u2019re a good side. Let\u2019s not get carried away with external factors, but concentrate on ourselves.\u201d In Sunday\u2019s European match against Wasps in Coventry, Joseph will line up against Elliot Daly, another classic 13 of the outside-break variety. With Manu Tuilagi set to return in the new year, Jones\u2019s options are building."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
