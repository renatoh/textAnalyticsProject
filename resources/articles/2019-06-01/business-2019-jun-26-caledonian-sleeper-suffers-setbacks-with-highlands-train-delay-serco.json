The flagship overnight train, billed as a hotel on wheels, has been plagued by problems on the lowland route between London, Edinburgh and Glasgow since the introduction of a new \u00a3150m fleet. The sleeper operator, Serco, said further new Spanish-built carriages from the manufacturer CAF would be used to supplement the lowland service rather than launch on the scenic Highlands routes to Fort William and Inverness. The upgraded trains, featuring double beds and ensuite bathrooms and partly funded by the Scottish government, should appear in the Highlands in September. Customers who booked for 7 July onwards can either get a full refund or the fare difference for the existing, 30-year-old rolling stock. Passengers were promised a luxury experience, paying from \u00a3400 for a double ensuite, but reality has fallen short for many travellers. On a disastrous first night in April both north and southbound trains rolled in hours late. The delay was due to signalling problems, but compounded by the sleeper\u2019s onboard problems, with customers booked into the wrong cabins and the vaunted catering going awry. Technical faults with the trains have led to a number of overnight services being cancelled or curtailed, leaving passengers stranded until morning. Punctuality is the worst of any UK train operator: last month, official figures showed only three in five trains ran from London to Edinburgh on time. Ryan Flaherty, Serco\u2019s managing director at Caledonian Sleeper, said: \u201cWe are disappointed to be announcing this further delay but it is undoubtedly the correct decision and will allow us to improve the reliability and resilience of the lowlander fleet and maintain capacity on the Highland route. \u201cOur priority must be delivering a reliable service on the lowland route and then make sure that each new carriage on the Highland route is ready to welcome guests and deliver a true Caledonian Sleeper experience.\u201d Transport Scotland said the latest delay was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d but blamed the manufacturer for failing to supply enough trains in time. Staff have reported being at \u201cbreaking point\u201d through stress since the new fleet arrived, according to unions. RMT threatened strike action, adding that onboard crew stuck on delayed trains with disgruntled customers were \u201cunable to see how they are ever going to have anything like a good work-life balance again\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
