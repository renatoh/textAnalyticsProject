His theme was \"the computer revolution hasn't happened yet,\" and he showed a number of demos from the 60s and 70s (Sutherland, Engelbart etc) to ilustrate that things are in many ways worse now than they were then. He used Squeak for his talk, while rubbishing Java, so it would be interesting to know how many attendees went on to download it. Squeak is a user- and child-friendly version of the object-oriented Smalltalk language Kay invented."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
