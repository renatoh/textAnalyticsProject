A Canadian company listed in London with a market capitalisation of \u00a3296m, Entertainment One will make an announcement about the approach to the Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Investment banks JP Morgan Cazenove and Credit Suisse have been appointed to advise the board on the offer and the banks are expected to market the company to seek out further approaches. Peppa Pig now has its own UK theme park and launched in the US this year, where it airs daily as one of the top ten shows on Nick Jr. A licensing deal with Fisher Price will see Peppa toys in US shops for Christmas. But the bulk of Entertainment One's revenues come from film and TV distribution in the UK and America. Its library of films was valued at $250m (\u00a3158) last year. Among the titles it distributes are the high profile Twilight vampire series and children's animated feature Gnomeo &amp; Juliet. The company increased revenues by 12% last year to just under \u00a3470m, delivering a profit before tax of \u00a332m. It cut debt by \u00a325m to \u00a339m in the year to 31 March 2011. The offer for Entertainment One means the UK's three best known kids entertainment companies are now in play. Thomas the Tank Engine's owner HIT Entertainment, owned by private equity group Apax Partners, is currently considering approaches from toy makers, believed to include Tomy and Mattel. Meanwhile, 3i has put Chorion, owner of the Mr Men and Noddy franchises, after pressure from the company's lending banks.
