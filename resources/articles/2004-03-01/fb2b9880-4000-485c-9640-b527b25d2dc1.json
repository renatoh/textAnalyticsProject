The men, who were arrested as part of the US-led \"war on terror\", landed at RAF Northolt at 6.59pm after a journey of approximately seven hours. Ruhal Ahmed, 23, Asif Iqbal, 20, and Shafiq Rasul, 25, from Tipton, West Midlands, as well as Tarek Dergoul, 24, and Jamal al Harith, 35, were released from the US base in Cuba earlier today. Security at the entrance to the base was tight, but police kept a low profile in the surrounding area as waiting media clamoured for positions in an enclosed pen at the end of the base's main runway. The five men are now expected to be questioned at Paddington Green high security police station in central London. Four more British men will remain among the terror suspects held in legal limbo at Camp Delta. They face the prospect of controversial military tribunals after home secretary David Blunkett said yesterday that evidence against them would be \"best used in the US not in Britain\". He said during a speech at Harvard University's law school in Boston, Massachusetts: \"We are seeing the release of five of the nine UK citizens who are held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay over the next 24 hours. \"They, when they return, will of course go through the normal process of being interviewed by the counter-terrorism branch in London and the material that has been provided will be evaluated.\" Mr Blunkett said last night that the other four were different cases because they had been arrested \"in the combat zone\" in Afghanistan. \"The evidence that has been picked up is best used in the US not in Britain because the people who evaluated that evidence, who heard that evidence are, of course, those who were present and have been involved with the interrogation process,\" he said. Human rights group Liberty said the four who remain in Guant\u00e1namo Bay should either be released or put on trial in accordance with international law. Lawyer Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said Mr Blunkett's speech signalled the end of British opposition to the \"kangaroo courts\" proposed by the US. \"The reason given by the home secretary for preferring trial in America does not add up,\" he said. \"The evidence given by officials can, of course, be given anywhere in the world. The testing of its veracity, however, would be different before a British court.\" Mr Blunkett last night said that negotiations with the US on how trials should be carried out were continuing. \"I'm very clear that the attorney general's view was that if people were to be held and tried on the basis of the material the US have, it would be better that they were tried with process here.\" Those remaining behind in Cuba are: Feroz Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London; Moazzam Begg, 36, from Sparkhill, Birmingham; Martin Mubanga, 29, from London; Richard Belmar, 23, from London. Azmat Begg, 65, Moazzam Begg's father, yesterday denounced a leak from the Bush administration which alleged his son trained at an al-Qaida training camp as he accompanied British campaigners to Washington. He said the US was \"lying\" about his son's alleged links with al-Qaida, or had pressured him into making a false confession. In a letter delivered to President Bush at the White House, Mr Begg wrote: \"Mr President, I do not plead for mercy, my son has not been charged with any crime. I ask for justice. Before mercy comes justice, and my son has been denied justice.\" Mr Begg was with a group of campaigners, including former Beirut hostage Terry Waite, which was in Washington at the same time as Mr Blunkett, who was in the US capital for talks on terrorism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
