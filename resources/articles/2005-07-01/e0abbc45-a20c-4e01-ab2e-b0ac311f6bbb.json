An Isthmian League ground in Kingston may not have been the most appealing place to spend a humid midsummer Saturday afternoon but, for the Manchester rebels with a cause, there was nowhere else to be. \"It's the first time they've had to travel a great distance,\" said United's manager Karl Marginson, \"and you saw how much it means to them through their vocal support and their songs about the players. They're right behind the team because they own it.\" Football's obsession with money, and in particular Malcolm Glazer's \u00a3790m takeover of Manchester United, was the catalyst for the club's creation but Andy Walsh, a director of FCUM - \"the name was chosen by our supporters and it does trip off the tongue, doesn't it?\" - has no problem with wealthy benefactors coming on board. \"Money's not evil. This is about how a club like Manchester United is used to make money for a very small group of individuals. If a disenchanted supporter came to us with \u00a31m we'd take it and that person would have one vote at our AGM - like everyone else. \"At the beginning we were told it would all fizzle out and we'd end up trooping back to Old Trafford with our tails between our legs to support Glazer's business plan, but that's not happened. \"The spirit and soul of Manchester United will be sustained within FC United. We want to establish a community team and drive roots throughout Greater Manchester to sustain it, whatever happens at Old Trafford.\" Supporters Direct and AFC Wimbledon have provided invaluable advice as FC United prepare for life in the North West Counties League playing the likes of Blackpool Mechanics, Holker Old Boys and New Mills. A move to Milton Keynes prompted the rebirth of the Dons and, after two promotions in three seasons, the Football League could be reached within another three years. Saturday's game was settled by a goal from Ricci Crace, one of four half-time Wimbledon substitutes, when he lobbed Barry George in the 56th minute. How far can FC United go? It is early days but, with their base at Bury's Gigg Lane and such a loyal following, the immediate future looks bright - at least according to AFC Wimbledon's manager Dave Anderson. \"They're a good side,\" he said, \"and they'll win their league by about 400 points.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
