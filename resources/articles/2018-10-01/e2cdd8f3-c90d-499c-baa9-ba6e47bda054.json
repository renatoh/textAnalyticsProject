The pages removed span the political spectrum. According to a blogpost authored by Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, and product manager, Oscar Rodriguez, these pages were removed not due to their political content, but because they had violated the social network\u2019s terms of service. \u201cMany were using fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same names and posted massive amounts of content across a network of Groups and Pages to drive traffic to their websites,\u201d the post said. \u201cMany used the same techniques to make their content appear more popular on Facebook than it really was. Others were ad farms using Facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\u201d The affected pages include Nation in Distress, Reverb Press, Reasonable People Unite, The Resistance, Right Wing News and Snowflakes. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the pages were among those removed, but said it would not release a complete list. Edward Lynn, editor-in-chief at Reverb Press, found out his page had been removed when he read a news story about it this morning. He hotly disputes Facebook\u2019s claims that his site is \u201cinauthentic\u201d. \u201cWe are a legitimate news publisher,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not fake news. We are not misinformation. We are not foreign. We are simply a small independent news publication trying to grow.\u201d Lynn said that, prior to his becoming editor-in-chief this year, some people affiliated with Reverb shared its content on Facebook using \u201cbackup accounts\u201d to avoid being targeted by conservative opponents and \u201cbeing sent to Facebook jail\u201d. But he said his writers no longer followed that practice. He also said Reverb published content across multiple pages and shared it with other left-leaning sites, but added that this was common on social media. \u201cGo read any social media expert\u2019s advice and they all say to share on more than one page or platform,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the social media playbook. It\u2019s a standard practice, and it\u2019s being used as an excuse for censorship.\u201d Lynn says he plans to appeal against the decision to remove his page, but isn\u2019t confident Facebook will respond. The news comes on the heels of another, apparently unrelated crackdown on the Russian database provider SocialDataHub for allegedly scraping personal information from Facebook accounts. According to a statement released by Facebook, 66 SocialDataHub accounts, profiles, pages and apps have been removed from the social network, and more may be disabled later as they are uncovered. On SocialDataHub\u2019s English language website, it claims to have collected data on 147 million users taken from \u201copen sources, blogs, forums and mass media, RSS and ads\u201d as well as mobile apps. It also claims it has the ability to capture new information within five minutes of it appearing on the internet. When asked for comment, SocialDataHub released a statement from its CEO, Artur Khachuyan, detailing the company\u2019s work with banks and government entities in applying artificial intelligence to unstructured data. He said his company only obtained information from Russian Facebook accounts, which he said was legal under Russian law. He added that \u201camong the disconnected accounts, there were students who actually carried out web scraping, but all the data was deleted by them, and the logs were provided by Facebook. We are waiting for the speedy unlocking of our accounts \u2026 Not all Russian hackers are actually Russian hackers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
