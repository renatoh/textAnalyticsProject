Usually, Sydney doctor Jamal Rifi is among the first to speak out. \u201cIt is alien,\u201d he says of Cheng\u2019s murder. \u201cTotally against the teachings of Islam.\u201d Rifi has delivered that message all week across television and radio, and in an op-ed in Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph calling on Muslim parents to take ownership of the problem. But inside Australia\u2019s diverse Muslim communities, how to respond to violence committed in the name of Islam is the source of deep disagreement, usually private, but this week spilling out into what some called \u201cpersonal attacks and character assassination\u201d. Veteran Muslim educator Silma Ihram is another familiar face on television after counter-terrorism raids, or after a young Australian slips into Iraq or Syria. She is weary of continually having to assert that Australians Muslims condemn groups such as Isis. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re a parent. You\u2019re constantly reassuring that the Muslim community is not with them. I\u2019ve said it earlier this year, and the year before that, and the year before that,\u201d she says. \u201cI understand the detractors in the community, those who get frustrated and say, when is this going to end?\u201d Community advocates such as Lydia Shelly, a lawyer, speak of \u201cthe bind\u201d they face when dealing with media. \u201cWhen you see tragedies and violence committed in the name of your religion, you have a personal obligation to respond. Your religion doesn\u2019t allow you to do these types of thing, and you have to clarify that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at the same time, we don\u2019t necessarily want our internal politics out there for public consumption. And we don\u2019t want to see any further police responses or ineffective policies that target our community.\u201d One grievance is that the media, distant from many Muslim communities, sometimes does not understand where influence or expertise lies. Comedian Nazeem Hussein drew laughs when he revealed how a journalist had called him in the hours after Friday\u2019s incident, asking \u201coff the record\u201d if he knew the gunman. More seriously, Yassir Morsi, a critical race theorist from the University of South Australia, asks: \u201cWhat has a local imam, a doctor, a principal, got to do with talking about the excesses of war that have come out of Syria? \u201cAll of a sudden they are expected to be experts on psychology, sociology, politics, youth culture, international relations, just because they\u2019re Muslim. \u201cGet Muslims on,\u201d he says, \u201cBut those who have some kind of expertise, or who speak from relevant experience. Asking them to give an insight into a collective condition is problematic. It reaffirms the issue lays solely within the community.\u201d Writer and researcher Randa Abdel-Fattah agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s a political naivety in the way we respond to this. People genuinely feel that if you tell the wider public there\u2019s a problem and we\u2019re part of the solution, that will reassure them that we\u2019re not a problem community.\u201d Condemning Isis is the \u201ceasiest thing to do\u201d, Morsi says. Harder is to challenge damaging narratives around Islam in Australia, which alienate some young Muslims, and play into extremist propaganda that they will never find a home or voice here. \u201cThe idea that radicalisation results from bad mosques, bad people, bad religion, is how Islamophobia operates,\u201d Morsi says. \u201cIt forecloses political and historical complexities that create today\u2019s violence. Islamophobia skews the fight against radicalisation: we end up chasing this immoral figure more than addressing the conditions that created it,\u201d he says. For Rifi, discussions such as this are overly theoretical \u2013 important, but secondary in matters of life and death. \u201cWe need to get our priorities right. Islamophobia does exist, but Islamophobes are not killing our young boys and girls. They\u2019re probably making them angry, but they\u2019re not killing them,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s killing them is the preachers of hate that are brainwashing our kids and infecting their thoughts with this idea that it is permissible by God to kill innocents. \u201cThis ideology of hate, that should be the priority of our community to combat.\u201d Frustration with Rifi\u2019s public stand boiled over on social media this week. Memes and messages circulated that criticised, sometimes harshly, the 2015 Australian Father of the Year. Facebook and Twitter have been as disruptive to the social hierarchies of Muslim communities as any other. A younger generation, raised in the glare of a global \u201cwar on terror\u201d, favour a more challenging approach, and can speak for themselves. Rifi has been \u201csurprised\u201d by the controversy. \u201cI reckon some people in my community, they don\u2019t want us to send this message, they want our young people to feel almost always insular, and to feel insecure, not to interact or integrate,\u201d he says. Ihram acknowledges \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d behind radical Islam-inspired violence, including debates over Australian foreign policy, but says: \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t excuse the decision of a 15-year-old boy to go and commit murder. The fact these things are happening has gone beyond that. \u201cRecognising [Islamophobia] or not recognising it will not change the government involvement in the community at the moment, nor will it stop the recruiters from utilising the community\u2019s disaffection,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore a crisis like this happens, a lot of us have been trying to get foothold in the media saying that not addressing the Syrian problem, sending warplanes and bombs into Iraq and Syria, are going to cause more problems. \u201cBut now is not the time to say that,\u201d she says. \u201cNow is the time to say, OK, we can\u2019t change government decisions at the moment, what we have to do is to ask: how can we prevent more 15-year-old kids being attracted to committing horrific crimes?\u201d Maha Abdo has watched the sometimes unruly discussion this week. The longtime head of the Muslim Women\u2019s Association says the debate \u201cis a healthy one, a learning process for the community\u201d. \u201cYou have some who don\u2019t want to continue to be justifying or apologetic,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd those who feel the need to get out there and recognise that there are millions of Australians who want to hear that voice, and that\u2019s OK. There\u2019s room for both voices. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist, and this week I\u2019ve seen a few thorns. But soon the roses are going to come out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
