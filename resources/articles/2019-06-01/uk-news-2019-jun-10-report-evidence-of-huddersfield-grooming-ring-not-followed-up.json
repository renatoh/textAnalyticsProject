A report into the cases of more than 20 girls in Huddersfield found that social workers had evidence to conclude that two teenage victims were at risk of serious harm, yet took no action. Dr Mark Peel, the author of the review, said children\u2019s services officers knew that the two 16-year-olds, one of whom had learning difficulties, were \u201cmost likely to have been engaged in inappropriate, exploitative and illegal sexual activity\u201d with older men. He added: \u201cIn both instances, however, it would appear that, other than recording this information, no subsequent preventative safeguarding action was taken, and that thus an opportunity to break the [child sexual exploitation] ring operating in Kirklees, and to protect these girls directly and others more generally, was lost.\u201d The report, published on Monday, examined the files of 22 girls involved in the prosecution of 20 men who were given lengthy jail sentences last year after being convicted of a \u201cvile and wicked\u201d campaign of abuse spanning from 2004 to 2011. Three trials heard how 15 vulnerable girls, aged as young as 11, fell victim to a grooming ring and were plied with drugs and alcohol before being subjected to abuse that was \u201cat the top of the scale\u201d of severity. Peel, a social work academic, said that nothing relating to child sexual exploitation [CSE] was flagged up in the majority of cases, but that this may have been because social work professionals were not looking for CSE at that time. However, he found that in the cases of two girls, referred to as Girl 4 and Girl 8, there was intelligence that they were at risk of serious harm. A reference to Girl 4 in one of the files said: \u201c[Girl 4] has a moderate learning difficulty. She is being exploited into prostitution, she hangs around with a number of men who take her money. She is a very promiscuous girl.\u201d Concluding that \u201cno action of any kind was taken in both these instances\u201d, Peel said this \u201cseeming lack of concern\u201d for vulnerable children \u201cnow seems almost alien\u201d. What social workers now understand as CSE was in 2006-07 perhaps seen as \u201cnothing out of the ordinary\u201d for young women typically on social work caseloads, he said, adding that \u201ca different and lower safeguarding standard was implicitly applied to some young women in need of help and support\u201d. Mel Meggs, Kirklees council\u2019s director of children\u2019s services, said: \u201cDr Peel has been clear that the vast majority of cases were handled in line with the policy and practice of the time. \u201cHowever, the studies of Girl 4 and Girl 8 show that, historically, professionals did not always spot the signs of exploitation and did not always respond appropriately to concerns. We are truly sorry that these two girls were not protected in the right way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
