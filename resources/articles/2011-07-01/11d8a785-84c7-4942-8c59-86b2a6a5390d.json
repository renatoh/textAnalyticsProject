While Snoop and Warren may be best sticking to spitting rhymes, Idowu proves that a good jump can go a long way. 2) And so the One Year To Go countdown begins ... With Wednesday marking one year until the Games, London was awash with celebrities and medal hopefuls. Events kicked off with the official handing over of the \u00a3269m Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park, the last of the six permanent venues to be completed. In Horse Guards Parade David Cameron played a spot of beach volleyball, while at St Pancras Station, Lord Coe, chairman of the organising committee, and Colin Jackson, a silver medallist in the 110m hurdles at Seoul in 1988, were having their famous feet cast to represent \"the first steps to the Games\". David Bond, who won a sailing gold medal at the 1948 London Olympics, reminded everyone that the Games will affect the rest of the country too, unveiling the Royal Mail's Olympic plans in Cornwall, which will include issuing a stamp for every gold medal won by Britain. Later in the evening all eyes were back on the Aquatics Centre, where the 17-year-old medal hopeful Tom Daley completed the pool's first dive during the evening ceremony. The International Olympic Committee's president, Jacques Rogge, was next to take centre stage, officially inviting the world to attend the 2012 Games, before Boris Johnson brought proceedings to a close, the London mayor leaving us with a customarily effervescent take on the new Olympic pool: \"Is it not mind-blowing? It is an architectural poem; it's a sinuous wave of beauty. That water looks good enough to drink. It is gin-clear.\" 3) Tweet of the Week \"little bit strange when you ring the surgery to check your vaccinations and they begin congratulating you on your season\" \u2013 Dai Greene. 4) Lord Coe names his greatest Olympians Lord Coe gave his verdict on the greatest Olympic athletes of all time in an interview with Sport Magazine. The list included track greats such as Fanny Blankers-Koen, the star of the 1948 London Games, and Jesse Owens, who inspired a generation of black athletes at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Sir Steve Redgrave is chosen for his magnificent feat of five gold medals in five different Games. Coe also mentioned the Romanian gymnast Nadia Comeneci, who achieved a perfect score of 10.00 at Montreal in 1976. However, Lord Coe placed the great British decathlete Daley Thompson at the top of his all-time Olympians, describing the 1980 and 1984 gold medallist as \"an extraordinary competitor with unique mental and physical power\". 5) Good week/bad week It was a good week for the American swimmers at the World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, notably Ryan Lochte. The 26-year-old set a world record on his way to gold in the 200m individual medley, and added another gold in the 200m freestyle to reinforce his 2012 medal credentials. It has been a bad week for Shanaze Reade, whose preparations for London 2012 were dealt a blow on Monday when she pulled out of the World BMX Championships in Copenhagen after aggravating a wrist injury. 6) Phelps wins gold at world championships Michael Phelps has been out of form and this trend looked set to continue at Shanghai's world championships as he finished third in the 400m freestyle relay on Sunday and second in the 200m freestyle on Tuesday. The swimmer who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing was back to form on Wednesday, however, sending an ominous message to his 2012 rivals in holding off Japan's Takeshi Matsuda to win his first gold of the championships in his favoured 200m butterfly. 7) Medal designs unveiled According to IOC president Jacques Rogge \"these beautiful medals will be a fitting reward for the Olympic medallists of 2012\". The design consists of the goddess Nike, who is traditionally present, and several features of the host city including the river Thames. 8) British musicians reveal the Olympic anthem The British rapper Tinchy Stryder and the 15-year-old soul singer Dionne Bromfield have revealed the video for the official Olympics anthem. It involves Stryder driving a Mini over Tower Bridge and close-up shots of the Olympic Torch. 9) Sky Orchestra sets tone for Games If you're one of those people who wake up on Monday morning with a sinking feeling, you may have been in luck this week. The artist Luke Jerram was behind the Sky Orchestra project, in which hot-air balloons hovered over the London skyline and played scores provided by the award-winning composer Dan Jones. Boris Johnson hailed the stunt as \"a stunning preview of the astonishing variety of cultural events and activities\" surrounding the countdown to the Games. 10) Things you may have missed on theguardian.com Guardian.co.uk's guide to the 50 top British medal hopes ... ... a swishy 3D interactive guide to the London 2012 Olympic Park ... ...
