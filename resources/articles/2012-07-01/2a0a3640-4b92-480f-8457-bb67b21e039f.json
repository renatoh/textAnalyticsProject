This lie has to stop", "bodyText": "A rumour has been doing the rounds \u2013 unfounded but all too credible \u2013 that health secretary Andrew Lansley wants to scrap the 49% cap on the proportion of private income that NHS institutions can earn. One wouldn't want hospitals holding back, just in case they accidently nosed over into the forbidden 50%, would we? That might hamper private-sector efficiency. It doesn't seem credible that the Conservatives can carry on believing the private sector is more efficient while actually in the process of drafting in the public sector army (which I've heard prides itself on efficiency) to address the mess the private sector G4S has made of Olympic security. G4S are not only inefficient, but delusional and cowardly. They didn't even admit they were fouling up until the last possible moment. But neo-liberal faith in the magic of the profit motive continues, however facile the arguments are in theory, and however clearly wrong in practice. The only real efficiency the private sector has is that its failures go bust, while public-sector failures must struggle on. I'm particularly fond of the argument that says private sector involvement in health provision doesn't encourage queue-jumping, but just makes queues shorter. How does that work? Does it automatically mean there are fewer citizens in need of a certain operation? Or does it automatically mean that there are more experienced surgeons to carry them out? One of these must pertain if the queue is to become shorter, rather than be simply divided into two \u2013 paying and non-paying \u2013 the former obviously getting rather miffed if payment doesn't help them to jump the queue. How can these free-market fundamentalists all carry on believing such sheer, utter, nonsense, even as their grand experiment crumbles around them?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
