Many would surely agree with these words, even after being told they are in fact lyrics from a Blue \u00d6yster Cult song which also contains the slightly less profound lines, \"Oh no, there goes Tokyo/Go go Godzilla!\" That nature must not be defied is part of folk wisdom, accepted by everyone from American metal bands to liberal social commentators. The difficulty comes in understanding what it means to defy nature. For the strange thing is that among those agreeing with Bacon you'll find both environmentalists and their mortal enemies, the scientists developing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is because each side has a very different idea of what it means to go against nature. For the scientist, of course you need to \"obey\" nature, because nothing can break the laws of nature and work. So GMOs do not defy nature. If they did, they'd have remained science fiction. Thus scientists are in total agreement with Bacon. They see their job as commanding nature - in the sense of trying to harness nature for our own benefit - and they achieve this goal by working within the limits of possibility prescribed by nature's laws. Those who think scientists go too far cannot cite Bacon in support. They might think that we cannot or should not command nature as much as we do, or that obeying her really should mean leaving her alone. But these injunctions go way beyond the demand to work with nature rather than against her. They rather spring from a caution against hubris and the fear that we may be moving too far too fast. There may be some sense in that, but as an intellectually satisfying rationale for restraint, it's more Blue \u00d6yster Cult than Francis Bacon."}, "isHosted": false}}}
