The Labour leader had been due to meet May to discuss the Brexit crisis alongside the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Vince Cable, and the parliamentary leaders of Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But those present said he quit the meeting once he realised that former Labour MP Umunna, who is not a party leader but the spokesman for the newly formed group of MPs made up of Tory and Labour defectors, had also been invited. A Labour spokesperson said afterwards: \u201cIt was not the meeting that had been agreed \u2026 the terms were broken\u201d and that the party was talking to No 10 about holding a face-to-face meeting that Corbyn had earlier proposed at prime minister\u2019s questions. Umunna, however, claimed it was \u201cextraordinary behaviour\u201d and added: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what people expect from a leader of the opposition at a time of crisis when the people that elect us to come together and see if there is a way forward.\u201d Cable said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s kinder, gentler politics was found wanting as he stomped out of the meeting before it began rather than breathe the same air as Chuka Umunna.\u201d Corbyn subsequently spoke to May on the telephone, and complained that she had offered nothing new beyond a choice between her deal and no deal next week. The Labour leader said the prime minister was \u201cin complete denial about the scale of the crisis we are facing and unable to offer the leadership the country needs\u201d. During the day, there were also signs that a small number of Labour MPs were now prepared to switch sides and back May\u2019s Brexit deal after the EU said it had to pass the Commons next week. Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan, said she would be \u201cminded to vote\u201d for May\u2019s Brexit deal if the prime minister accepted an amendment submitted in her name and that of party colleague Gareth Snell on Wednesday evening. Earlier in the day, Snell said he too was considering a switch to backing May. \u201cI\u2019m increasingly coming to the conclusion that the only way to stop no deal may be to vote for her deal. I\u2019m not happy about that. I think that was her plan all along.\u201d Nandy, however, would not predict exactly how many Labour MPs might support her amendment, other than to say that she thought it would win the backing of \u201ca number of us\u201d. She added: \u201cIt is the best prospect May has.\u201d But late on Wednesday, after Nandy had said she might back the prime minister, the MP reacted badly to May\u2019s evening televised statement where she expressed frustration with parliament repeatedly blocking her Brexit deal. \u201cPitting parliament against the people in the current environment is dangerous and reckless,\u201d Nandy said. \u201cNow she\u2019s attacking the MPs whose votes she needs. It will have cost her support.\u201d The prime minister would need the support of about 30 Labour MPs to have a chance of forcing her deal through, assuming she managed to also sign up the Democratic Unionist party, to offset the estimated two dozen Tory diehards who will never support the prime minister. Other Labour MPs reacted with a mixture of anger and scepticism to Nandy and Snell\u2019s intervention. One said that he and party colleagues were very unhappy with the idea that the pair were willing to engage in discussions with the Tories. The amendment, if accepted, would require May \u2013 or whoever is the prime minister \u2013 to accept three conditions to the next phase of Brexit negotiations on a future trade deal that would begin if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the Commons. It would require the prime minister to agree a negotiating mandate with the Commons before trade deal talks start, report back on progress every three months, and require a confirmatory vote by MPs at the end of the process. Nandy said she had discussed the idea with May \u201cthree or four times\u201d and said that she would link the amendment to a third meaningful vote next week. Otherwise it would be put forward on Monday, when MPs are due to discuss the next Brexit steps. Earlier in the day, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, secured an emergency Commons debate to discuss the crisis by invoking a procedure that required the support of at least 40 MPs. But a cross-party attempt to submit an amendment to that debate, calling for a long delay to Brexit, collapsed after it emerged that Labour\u2019s leadership was not prepared to support a lengthy extension, sources said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
