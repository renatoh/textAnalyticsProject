It's all slightly improbable, but then songs adopted by protesters almost invariably are. Lethal Bizzle and the Bangles take their place alongside David Hasselhoff, whose Looking for Freedom started life as a song about a son trying to escape the influence of his rich father, ended up as a jingle for a mobile phone company and in between became an anthem for the collapse of communism in East Germany. Sometimes, the ad-hoc protest song is adopted out of necessity \u2013 music simply hasn't caught up with events. Sometimes, it's adopted out of choice. If you were a 70s feminist, the only thing pop had to offer was Helen Reddy's schmaltzy yet dour I Am Woman (\"I'm a woman, hear me roar,/ In numbers too big to ignore\"). Casting around for something else, they alighted on Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. The de facto gay liberation anthem of the same era was Tom Robinson's Glad to Be Gay, which is sincere, but makes being gay sound about as much fun as a barium meal. Who wouldn't opt instead for McFadden and Whitehead's Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now, which had no more pressing message than how amazing McFadden and Whitehead were, but surrounded its defiance with the glitziness of disco? Not everyone is happy to take on the mantle \u2013 Martha Reeves of the Vandellas told the Guardian's Dorian Lynskey she had had \"a physical and mental breakdown\" as a result of people thinking Dancing in the Street was a call to black revolution \u2013 and you could argue that protesters who adopt an unrelated song to their cause are wilfully missing the point. I can't help feeling cheered by them, partly because they seem symbolic both of pop's mutability and a resourcefulness of spirit on the part of protesters, but mostly because, however unlikely they seem, these records always avoid the charges levelled at actual protest songs \u2013 whatever else you think of the Bangles' Walk Like an Egyptian, you'd never call it preachy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
