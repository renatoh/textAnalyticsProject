Greater Manchester police said officers tried to stop the Ford Fusion at 9.25pm on Sunday before it made off and collided with a building in the suburb of Burnage. The two occupants of the car were taken to hospital with injuries described as life-threatening, police said. One of the men, aged in his late teens, died later in hospital and the other remains in a critical condition. The dead teenager was named locally as Deon Simpson according to the Manchester Evening News. Police said the incident had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has launched an investigation in the circumstances around the crash, in line with policy around fatal crashes following a police pursuit. Images from the scene appeared to show the vehicle flipped on its side into the end of a row of shops at the busy junction in south Manchester. Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said its officers pulled the two men from the wreckage at the junction of Burnage Lane and Lane End Road. DCS Jon Chadwick, of GMP\u2019s professional standards branch, said: \u201cI would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family of the person who has passed away following the collision in Burnage last night. \u201cThe response to the incident is still ongoing and there are a number of road closures in place in the nearby area, with the scene likely to remain for some time. \u201cIn line with our usual policy with incidents of this nature, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and they have made a decision to launch an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
