Although officials believe it is too early to quantify the full impact of an America-induced slowdown, they said that the outlook was darkening even before the crippling blow from the destruction in New York and Washington. Treasury economists have been briefing Gordon Brown twice a day on the implications for Britain of the closure of financial markets, the paralysis of air travel and the potential for consumer confidence to be adversely affected by the catastrophe. \"It was a difficult time anyway,\" said one senior Treasury official. \"People were revising down their forecasts and were probably going to revise them down again anyway. \"What happened on Tuesday makes it more uncertain. The big thing is what happens to confidence, both directly and in the financial markets\". The Treasury believes that there will be some short-term benefits to Britain from financial business being transferred from New York and because money that would have been spent on foreign travel is funnelled into the domestic economy. The fear is that these factors will be small in comparison with the negative effects. The official added that it was worrying that the Tokyo market had fallen by 6.5% and Hong Kong by 8% since Tuesday, although the fall in the FTSE 100 had been a relatively modest 2%. The first signs of whether the authorities believe the ripple effects from the US will significantly change the outlook for UK growth will come with the next meeting of the monetary policy committee, scheduled for early next month. Economists at the Bank are already assessing the prospects. The Treasury will have longer to make a judgment, its forecasts being published in the pre-budget report in November. Sources said yesterday that no precise forecasts would be made until after the publication of the so-called blue book, which will revise growth figures back to 1994. Figures released yesterday showed the resilience of consumer spending last month. Retailers enjoyed a sharp rise in sales as consumers took advantage of lower interest rates and bargain prices to snap up clothing, shoes and household goods. The office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes rose 0.5% in August to stand 6.3% higher on the year, the strongest annual rise since May. The jump in sales was higher than City analysts had expected, underlining how the strength of consumer demand has been keeping the economy afloat in the face of weak overseas orders. \"These figures tell us consumer spending remains fairly strong, driven by an extension of the summer sales in August,\" said Adam Chester, group economist at Halifax Group. But economists warned that the Indian summer on Britain's high streets could be followed by a colder autumn. A poll of City economists conducted by Reuters showed that 12 out of 20 respondents to the survey, carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, said they had revised downward their 2001 forecasts for UK growth. The median forecast for GDP growth this year was 2% year on year, a touch below the 2.1% in a July survey. An increasing number of City economists now expect interest rates to fall to 4.75% by the end of the year - its lowest level since the early 1960s. Even before Tuesday some economists had begun to anticipate a further rate cut, responding to data suggesting that UK business confidence would need a boost. Others said they had changed their forecasts because the attacks on the US would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates, and the Bank of England would follow suit. \"They're going to need to prop up consumer expenditure in the UK to keep the economy going while the US works through its current problems,\" said David Page at Investec. \"Much uncertainty lies ahead, with it still being very unclear what the impact of the attacks on the US might have on consumer confidence,\" said Michael Hume, UK economist at Lehman Brothers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
