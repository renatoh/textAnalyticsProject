The survivors A 94-year-old great-grandmother and an 82-year-old grandfather are among those to have beaten the coronavirus and returned to their homes. Grandmother-of-seven Joy spent nine days fighting the virus at James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk. \u201cThanks to the care, love and diligent attention of the NHS she is home in her own bed tonight,\u201d said her grandson, Toby Basil. Meanwhile, Joseph Ruddy, 82, returned home to his wife in Newcastle after spending 10 days in the Royal Victoria Infirmary. \u201cDone like a true trooper,\u201d said his granddaughter Erin, as she tweeted a photo of him being dropped off by a paramedic, now been liked more than 100,000 times. \u201cHe\u2019s in high spirits and glad to be home. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any symptoms and that\u2019s what surprised us all,\u201d Erin said. \u201cHis progress was monitored and he was allowed to come home on 28 March. He\u2019s a hero and I honestly hope this inspires others to think positive.\u201d The community cuppa A whole street in Hebden Bridge came together for a socially distanced cup of tea on Saturday after a neighbour said she was struggling with loneliness. Kirsty Newton suggested the idea via the street WhatsApp group: \u201cOur neighbour said she was feeling very low \u2013 she lives alone and her dog died in October, so she\u2019s really feeling very alone. So I said, well why don\u2019t we just have a cup of tea? We won\u2019t be next to each other but we can wave to each other and catch up.\u201d At 11am on Saturday, about 12 residents in the street brought out chairs and a brew in the sunshine, and chatted down the street. \u201cIt\u2019s nice just to have a bit of actual contact,\u201d said Newton, a 43-year-old musician. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got the screen contact, but it\u2019s not quite the same as actually seeing someone face-to-face.\u201d Another communal cuppa brought out even more residents yesterday, and Newton said they might organise another get together to celebrate a neighbours\u2019 upcoming birthday. The Stockport Spiderman A mysterious figure known only as the Stockport Spiderman has been cheering up isolated children in the Greater Manchester borough. Spiderman goes out for an hour each day \u2013 even superheroes need to take their government-sanctioned exercise \u2013 and visits a different neighbourhood to bring joy to children. Parents can request a visit to their street, on the condition their offspring stay indoors and wave from their windows. Many young fans have been donning Spiderman pyjamas and dressing gowns as they wait for their hero to appear in their cul-de-sac. In a video on his Facebook page, the Stocky Spidey explained the rules of engagement: \u201cI can only go out just for an hour a day, just to keep fit and strong. I know it\u2019s super hard for you all right now, having to stay indoors, not seeing your friends. But just know you\u2019re doing the right things. Keep listening to mum and dad and the grown-ups and I will see you soon.\u201d Also in Stockport, one household is bringing cheer to their street by dressing up lifesize bears in different costumes each day and arranging them in their front garden. So far the bears of Alvaston Avenue in Heaton Moor have been camping, done the ironing and vacuuming and even demonstrated how to practise social distancing with the help of a tape measure. The fancy dress postman Noticing his customers seemed a little down, a postie in South Tyneside decided to raise spirits by doing his rounds in fancy dress. Jon Matson, from West Bolden, has delivered mail dressed as Cleopatra, Little Bo Peep, a cheerleader and a soldier over the past few days, and has received an overwhelmingly positive response from the public. The 39-year-old father-of-two said: \u201cIt has lifted the spirits of the entire community and it\u2019s got a lot of people connected and talking which I think is a vital lifeline while we\u2019re stuck inside.\u201d He has gathered quite a collection from taking part in charity Boxing Day dips over the years, and after initially planning to dress up just a few times a week, popular demand means he has now promised to show off a new outfit every day. \u201cThe reaction on day one was amazing,\u201d Matson told the BBC. \u201cA few people didn\u2019t notice at first, but the word started to spread on Facebook and people were looking out for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
