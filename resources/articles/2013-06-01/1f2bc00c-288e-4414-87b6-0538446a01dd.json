Goodnight. Tessa Jowell made a good fist of reminding us of her part in the Olympics, but otherwise was a damp squib. Russell Brand won the popularity contest, clearly; but also moved a number of self-evidently true things into a public domain that persists in refuting them (eg, people take drugs when they feel helpless, there\u2019s no point just attacking the drug use; there isn\u2019t enough housing for people to live in; rich people need to pay more tax). I would love to see more of him on the pop current affairs circuit. Bojo is being uncharacteristically cautious, which means he has either stepped up his leadership ambitions or decided to stop hiding them. Either that, or he genuinely doesn\u2019t know what to do about Syria, has genuinely never met anyone who\u2019s taken drugs, and genuinely doesn\u2019t know how much an affordable home would be. In conclusion: Melanie Phillips is interesting... there\u2019s clearly some pantomime element to the way she argues - witness that Brand liked her in the green room, she can clearly talk to people she disagrees with, without shouting at them. And yet her behaviour towards the audience was as unpleasant as I\u2019ve ever seen a panellist be. Schoolmarmish one minute, hectoring the next... Part of me thinks this is deliberated, a move into the pinata phase of her career. For a longer time, you numptie! (That was to Ed Davey, who has somehow spinned, to himself, the line that \u00a39k is less money than \u00a33k.) This is exactly it - when you refuse to see housing as a matter of policy, you will inevitably end up with the conclusion \u201cthis is bad, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s nothing like good enough. That\u2019s why they\u2019re all on drugs, Melanie! Over the next spending period, the government has \u00a396billion earmarked for housing benefit and \u00a34billion earmarked for building new homes. Then they turn round and say \u201cthis benefit bill is unsustainable\u201d as if that\u2019s somehow the fault of people who can\u2019t afford their rent, that a government has no systematic housing policy. Rents in London have gone up by eight times as much as wages. There is a problem with somebody *whistles* flogging off housing stock and never building any more, and there is a problem with a lack of social housing, but there\u2019s a problem with wages as well. Tax is, as Polly Toynbee memorably said, an \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you\u2019ll do it\u201d deal. Hassling comedians to pay it voluntarily betrays a misunderstanding of the purpose of taxation. Sorry about the cats and the pigeons, by the way. I thought MP was going to have a conniption. This QT hasn\u2019t played to BoJo\u2019s strengths at all. He\u2019s extremely keen not to nail his colours to the mast on any of this, possibly with an eye to an unblemished diplomatic record for the future, but this makes it impossible for him to mobilise the thing that people like about him, viz, that he tells it like it is. I\u2019m groping for a phrase... it\u2019s something to do with cats, cats and pigeons. Someone on Twitter just accused me of having missed Melanie\u2019s rant. I didn\u2019t miss it. I just didn\u2019t think it warranted closer inspection. Wow. I honestly did not see how Russell was going to get his great clap out of this issue, and he went straight for the great clap source. \u201cWe are providing non-lethal assistance to some of the rebels.\u201d Ed Davey looks and sounds plausible, but it\u2019s really hard to see what this would amount to. Agencies out there are unimpressed by the \u201cnon-lethal\u201d response from governments. Do we think Phillips may have gone too far, calling the audience trivial and ignorant? More of the same; what\u2019s in it for me? What do I get out of it all? \u201cThere are no good outcomes for us\u201d This is an absolutely classic Phillips reading of everything. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me? What\u2019s a good outcome for me? I don\u2019t have a naval base in the Tartus! I don\u2019t care about dead people!\u201d Sorry, while the army types are rude to one another, check out the Mirror\u2019s front page for tomorrow. BoJo\u2019s answer is baffling, here - he\u2019s looked into it very closely, he\u2019s persuaded of Assad\u2019s atrocities, yet he\u2019s against arming anyone, he doesn\u2019t have any other ideas... It\u2019s like one giant shrug. It\u2019s an interesting tactic, this; he does seem to be cultivating this impression that he has some other urgent thing to do. It must be deliberate. It\u2019s not like Boisdales is going anywhere.* *In truth I have no idea where he eats. What I don\u2019t understand is why politicians think the decriminalisation argument is so toxic, for voters. Anyone who\u2019s at all interested in drug policy should watch this documentary - The House I Live In, by Eugene Jarecki. He makes a really strong case that drug laws in the US and, the way Melanie P would conceive them, in the UK, are basically a way to criminalise the poor (very strong racial context in the US). Trying to keep a clear head on the matter of Melanie Phillips, I do take agin her telling us that we\u2019ve all lost a sense of integrity, a sense of honesty... I don\u2019t see how this can be anything other than projection. Christine Lagarde is not a sensible person on the matter of women in the boardroom. I\u2019m not wild about Tessa Jowell\u2019s essentialist line that women are just better people than men. There\u2019s evidence that women are more risk averse because there aren\u2019t that many women on trading floors. If there were more women, there would doubtless be more women who were as reckless as men. It\u2019s interesting to see how the crowd-pleasers, like Boris, respond to being on the same panel as Brand, who is basically going to make the audience clap him until their hands bleed. He will end up having to agree with him as much as he can, it seems to me. Most probably against his better judgment. I\u2019m actually clapping at home, on my own. I just like Russell Brand's delivery. That\u2019s not true about the toughest regime on bankers\u2019 bonuses in the world, by the way. Switzerland is way tougher. Bankers there are often hired to do two simultaneous jobs to get round the fact that their salary and bonus caps are so strict. What\u2019s interesting is that a lot of bankers would like to see a return to unlimited liability, old school Victorian partnerships where they were betting with their own money. I mean, I say that... it was a relatively small sample I interviewed. But it\u2019s not a left-wing idea, that this socialised-losses, privatised-gains situation is a stupid one. The gamblers themselves claim not to like it. Evening everyone. Getting ready for Question Time; as always on a Thursday night at around this time, I have hopes, I have dreams. I hope the audience is full of lefties who clap in a partisan way; I like the rattled look the panels gets, as if they\u2019ve skirted a bit too close to the rabble. I hope I don\u2019t get so drunk that I\u2019m immobilised by the end and have to watch This Week; but most of all, I hope for a conversation in which people appear to be saying what they actually mean, and have actually thought about, rather than rehearsing over-simplified triple-line non-explanations they got from central office or headquarters or whatever grandiose word they have for a room full of 27-year-olds who think the general public is only interested in low taxes. That\u2019s what I dream of. Russell Brand will obviously be good in this sense, obeying only the head office of his heart, or the heart office of his head, or whatever; Boris Johnson, whose greatest fan I amn\u2019t, is good on this score as well. Onwards! Let dreams take wing!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
