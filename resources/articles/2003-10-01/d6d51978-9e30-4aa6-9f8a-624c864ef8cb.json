It is, unexpectedly, Premiership clubs of great resources who each have reason to idolise a single player. Thierry Henry makes statistics fly as well as sparks. Sunday's equaliser at The Valley put him in a dead heat with the rest of the squad in its entirety since he now has half of Arsenal's goals in all competitions to his credit this season. The side have hit the net intermittently in the Champions League but six of the past nine strikes are also the Frenchman's copyright. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger can hardly know whether to cheer the forward's speed or gibber at the toll it may be taking on his hamstrings. Such problems, however, are definitely shared. When Michael Owen is injured an agitated G\u00e9rard Houllier must pace outside the treatment room like a prospective father awaiting news at a maternity ward. Eight of Liverpool's 15 Premiership goals have come from the England forward. An intoxicating attacker is an addiction that does not show up on any of UK Sport's drug tests. Manchester United start to sweat when the Ruud van Nistelrooy supply tapers off. The Dutchman has nothing more than two penalties to his credit in the past five appearances and there have been defeats by Stuttgart and Fulham. The pattern is repeated at many prominent clubs, where the weight of ambition is usually borne by a single figure. Alan Shearer has hit 60% of Newcastle United's Premiership goals so far in this campaign. None of this occurs by managerial design and, at St James' Park, Sir Bobby Robson has tried to spread the load first by buying Craig Bellamy, who has proved not to be a natural finisher, and now by championing Shola Ameobi. Judging by the experiences of his counterparts, the Newcastle manager is going to have to be uncommonly lucky. Diego Forlan, with his \u00a37.5m price, was surely meant to be an equivalent to Van Nistelrooy, but few United supporters remark on the resemblance and his sweet drive against Fulham on Saturday was his first Premiership goal since last December. El Hadji Diouf never was a specialist in the penalty area even before he arrived at Anfield, and it will take even longer to bring the submerged predatory instincts of Milan Baros to light now that he has broken his ankle. Wenger, for his part, might relish hearing his cunning transfer record at Highbury being discussed but he would have to butt in to change the topic as soon as the names of Francis Jeffers and Sylvain Wiltord crept into the conversation. The clubs of slender means are the most democratic in extending the scoring franchise. Leicester City, bottom of the table, have notched a creditable 14 Premiership goals, yet Paul Dickov, their top scorer, leads the rankings with a relatively unassuming tally of four. It is poverty that makes the collaborative approach an inevitability rather than an aspiration. How could Leicester afford to buy or keep a marauding forward? It is the better-funded clubs who fall victim to the star syndrome even though they strive to guard against it. Having come up with the money to employ Van Nistelrooy and Henry respectively, United and Arsenal have been incapable of preventing these entrancing footballers from marginalising other attackers. Neither of them is prone to melodrama but they often give performances that dominate the stage. This kind of situation can develop in unexpected places. To their giddy gladness, Southampton found James Beattie developing into a prolific striker, but the only matches they have won this season are ones in which he has scored. Although Gordon Strachan appreciates that the emergence of so strong a performer is a potential weakness, he has not yet identified anyone else who can be trusted fully in attack. Agustin Delgado, Brett Ormerod and Kevin Phillips were acquired for a total of \u00a38m but none has so far proved his marksmanship at St Mary's. Even if United would never contemplate ditching Van Nistelrooy, it may be that clubs are better served by a series of less-celebrated forwards who take turns to excel. In the rapturous Treble-winning season, Sir Alex Ferguson watched Dwight Yorke score 18 Premiership goals, with Andy Cole only one behind and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer rattling in a creditable dozen. Now, there is a single leading club who spread the menace as easily. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has six league goals, with Adrian Mutu and Hernan Crespo level on four. Chelsea are different from their rivals and perhaps, come the end of the season, they will be gloriously detached at the top of the Premiership as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
