Onefootball.com reports that Uruguayan customs impounded 16 mini-fridges along with other unusual merchandise when the squad arrived in Montevideo. The Uruguay FA's Osvaldo Gimenez claimed the team had left Korea so quickly they hadn't had time to fill in the documentation. That is nothing compared to Brazil's famous haul from 1994, of course. Their 12 tons of imports from the US included computers, refrigerators, fax machines, laser printers, 18 TVs, microwaves, gym equipment, a barbecue, dishwashers and a leather horse saddle. \u00b7 So near and yet so far. According to South Korean sources, people in North Korea probably do not know about their neighbours' World Cup triumph, nor even that the tournament is taking place in Korea. The North has been showing highlights for an hour a day, but has not screened any games involving the South or referred to where they are being held. \u00b7 Spain's Javi de Pedro has outlined the tactics against the hosts, and they make for interesting reading (but not a very interesting match). \"If we keep the ball for 90 minutes, I think we will win,\" he said. Or get a solid 0-0 at least. \u00b7 Dunkirk was the unlikely venue for one of the World Cup's happier surprises, as 100 Senegalese converged on the home of Bruno Metsu's father after the win over Sweden. The coach's dad emerged from his house to the sound of drums and was carted around the neighbourhood by the gleeful fans. \u00b7 Not counting the England squad, there are 12 English-based players left at the World Cup, from nine clubs. They do not include Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United or Leeds, but Fulham (Eddie Lewis) Crystal Palace (Gregg Berhalter) and Leicester (Muzzy Izzet) are still there. Blackburn lead the way with three long-stayers (Brad Friedel, Hakan Unsal and Tugay). \u00b7 A Gallup poll in South Korea reveals possibly fatal levels of over-confidence. No fewer than 91.6% of respondents believe Spain will be beaten, while 26.5% expect their country to win the tournament. \u00b7 Space does not permit a detailed rundown of the horror that was Ireland's welcome home at Phoenix Park, but there is a full and hilarious account at dangerhere.com (also a fund of mindless quotes from RTE World Cup commentators). Suffice to say that Packie Bonner described the reception from the crowd and appalling media personalities as \"uncredible\". \u00b7 Spotted in an Ulsan hotel at 12.30am, the night before the most important game in their nation's history: Kasey Keller, Clint Mathis and Tony Meola. They weren't drinking, but they were playing pool. And talking about cheeseburgers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
