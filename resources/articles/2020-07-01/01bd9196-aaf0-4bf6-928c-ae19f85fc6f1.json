In her first annual report since taking up the role, Dame Vera Baird QC says there has been a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d decline in rape prosecutions, with no measures put in place to reverse it. Endorsing criticisms raised by campaigners against sexual violence, Baird writes: \u201cIn effect, what we are witnessing is the decriminalisation of rape. In doing so, we are failing to give justice to thousands of complainants. \u201cIn some cases, we are enabling persistent predatory sex offenders to go on to reoffend in the knowledge that they are highly unlikely to be held to account. This is likely to mean we are creating more victims as a result of our failure to act.\u201d Baird is a member of a review set up by the government to identify the reasons behind the fall in prosecutions but bemoans the fact that \u201ca year after it was set up, we are nowhere near to completing the review and making recommendations for change\u201d. She says that the dramatic fall appears to coincide with a series of visits by two senior Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures to specialist rape and serious sexual offences units, reported in the Guardian, in which they told staff to \u201cput a touch on the tiller\u201d when deciding whether to prosecute \u201cweak\u201d cases, in order to boost the conviction rate. While the CPS has denied a change in prosecution policy, Baird said that \u201cit has failed to offer any convincing explanation to account for the fall in the number of cases being prosecuted\u201d. In the year ending March 2017, the CPS prosecuted 3,671 cases, compared with 1,758 in the year ending March 2019, a drop of 52%. Baird says that anecdotally some police officers said they had made fewer referrals \u2013 which dropped by 22.6% over the same period \u2013 because they knew the CPS was prosecuting fewer cases. \u201cIf the CPS is unwilling or unable to deal with this failure effectively to prosecute rape, then the government must act,\u201d she says. Baird is also critical of prosecutors and police for demanding rape complainants\u2019 phone contents and personal records, using digital processing notices, forms for complainants to sign, introduced early last year, which she says have the effect of allowing police \u201cfree rein\u201d to extract data from their mobile phones. In her report, she highlights ending this \u201cintrusive breach of privacy\u201d as a priority for the coming year. \u201cThis situation has to change,\u201d writes Baird. \u201cVictims of rape and sexual assault are being badly let down.\u201d Shortly after taking office, the commissioner clashed with prosecutors after launching a campaign challenging police access to the mobile phones of those who report being raped. Prosecutors accused her of scaremongering, distorting the criminal investigations process, and discouraging victims from reporting attacks. Responding to the report, a CPS spokesperson said: \u201cWe share the concerns about the gap between reported rapes and those cases which come to court \u2026 Working with police, we are focused on understanding the reasons for the charging gap and are pleased to see the beginning of a reversal of this trend in the past year. However, we know there is much more to be done to drive up confidence in the justice system and will announce further plans shortly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
