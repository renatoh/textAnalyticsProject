The Portuguese\u2019s side were stunned 5-3 by Tottenham Hotspur, only the second time in a 14-year managerial career one of his teams has shipped five goals, to lose their points advantage at the top of the table and remain at the summit only on alphabetical order from Manchester City. That has left them with only one win in five away games but, while he acknowledged defensive deficiencies, Mourinho reserved his complaints over the non-award of a penalty for Jan Vertonghen\u2019s handball when his team had actually led 1-0. His criticism of the referee Phil Dowd\u2019s performance included a suggestion he was \u201c40 yards\u201d off the pace when Federico Fazio challenged Hazard late on, a tackle the Belgian subsequently acknowledged had been legitimate and did not prompt sanction. Yet his frustration merely mirrored that from after the draw at Southampton on Sunday when Cesc F\u00e0bregas had been booked for simulation having been clipped by Matt Targett in the penalty area. \u201cIn the 20 league matches we have played we have been the most offensive team, the team with more creative players in attacking areas,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have had two penalties in those games. \u201cIf people are in love with football in this country then they must be in love with Eden Hazard. But the way, match to match, he\u2019s being punished by opponents and not protected by referees \u2026 maybe one day we won\u2019t have Eden Hazard. It\u2019s one, two, three, four, five, 10 aggressive fouls against him. They kick and kick and kick, and the kid resists. He\u2019s a very honest guy in the way he plays but that\u2019s another problem.\u201d Chelsea were badly exposed by a fine Tottenham forward line led superbly by Harry Kane and could yet find their centre-half, Gary Cahill, sanctioned retrospectively for appearing to kick the grounded England Under-21 international in the back and on the calf in front of the dug-outs. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that, but was it [in the back], and not like [Raheem] Sterling in the face?\u201d asked Mourinho, although the manager was perplexed Vertonghen\u2019s handball back when the contest had remained tight had not merited a spot-kick. \u201cI could go in two directions and say we made some defensive mistakes and that every rebound and deflected shot they had went in. We conceded five goals, which is something out of our context. But I can go in another direction and say what we all know, which is, with the result 1-0, one clear action could make it 2-0. Normally, at 2-0, the result would be completely different and the history of the game would be different. \u201cI\u2019m more shocked with other things than us conceding five goals. That can happen. But where I am shocked is that, in three days, we\u2019ve had two incredible decisions that punished us in a very hard way. Two matches where we\u2019ve come away with one point when two crucial decisions would give us six points. There are things in the game that are becoming predictable. After that there is an action on Eden Hazard which, honest as always, he tells me in his opinion was not a foul or a red card. So that is good, in spite the fact Mr Dowd was too slow to follow that ball. He was 40 yards away but made the right decision. The decision he was 10m away he couldn\u2019t make.\u201d That criticism of Dowd , whom Sir Alex Ferguson had infamously claimed was not fit enough to stay up with the game after booking five Manchester United players in a draw with Arsenal in April 2013, was made in a television interview, with the manager tempering his observations upon arriving at the main post-match media conference. \u201cIt is difficult for him and difficult for everyone because F\u00e0bregas put the ball into space, Hazard attacked the space. But I knew that in case of doubt, and that situation was doubtful, it would go against us. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of situation we accept. The first one, in the first half, which is clear \u2026 like the one against Southampton, which was also clear. They\u2019re the ones that are difficult to accept. But managers and players, we win and lose. And Mr Dowd didn\u2019t lose. We didn\u2019t lose because of the group of players. Against Newcastle we had Matic suspended but Mikel played a very good game. We lost because we were unlucky and Newcastle were lucky. Mr Atkinson had a completely clean performance. It\u2019s the kind of game you lose. Today is a different story and against Southampton it\u2019s again a similar story. But there is nothing we can do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
