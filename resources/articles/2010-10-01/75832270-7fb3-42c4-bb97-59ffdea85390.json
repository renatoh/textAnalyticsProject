Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been among the managers to treat the domestic game's secondary cup tournament as an opportunity to blood fringe players and it has suffered a gradual series of knocks over the years. But Wenger broke from his policy in the early rounds at Newcastle United last night, when he fielded an Arsenal team featuring several established stars, including Walcott, and was rewarded with a 4-0 victory that carried the club into the quarter-finals. Wenger's signal of intent has been well received by many of the club's fans, who are desperate for Arsenal to win a first trophy since the FA Cup triumph of 2005. And Walcott, who has not yet won anything in his professional career, is serious about going all the way. The Carling Cup is the first trophy of the season to be handed out, with the final this season scheduled for 27 February at Wembley. \"I think it is a great opportunity for us to win it,\" Walcott said, mindful perhaps that Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool have already been knocked out. \"We want to win trophies. People might say it is a Mickey Mouse cup and things like that but for me personally it is a trophy. Our fans have been absolutely desperate for us to get a trophy and so have the players. Hopefully this could be one of many. If we continue to play football throughout the whole squad, then things are looking bright.\" Walcott scored twice in the victory at St James' Park to take his tally in all competitions to six; his best return from a domestic campaign is the seven he got in 2007-08. The game was also the first time since his return from a six-week ankle injury lay-off that he had completed 90 minutes. Walcott suffered the problem playing for England against Switzerland on 7 September. \"It is always frustrating but you can't help injuries,\" Walcott said. \"Mine was just a freak accident. I didn't think it would be that bad. I thought it would be a couple of weeks but it ended up being six. With injuries in the past I have been down in the dumps but I was a bit better this time and I just wanted to get back as soon as possible. It just flew by, to be honest. \"I just want to get game time now. I have been on the scoresheet a bit more often so I just hope that will continue.\" Wenger reported that Kieran Gibbs would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the medial knee ligament injury that he picked up at Newcastle. The defender will undergo a scan to ascertain the full extent of the problem. Aaron Ramsey and Robin van Persie are scheduled to return to training at the end of next week while Manuel Almunia, Thomas Vermaelen and Abou Diaby will not be fit for Saturday's visit of West Ham United. Jack Wilshere is suspended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
