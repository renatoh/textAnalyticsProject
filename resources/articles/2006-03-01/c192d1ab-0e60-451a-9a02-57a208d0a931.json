Sport-Express newspaper claimed Russian Football Association (RFU) chief Vitaly Mutko had informed the players of his decision in advance of today's friendly against world champions Brazil. However, this has not yet been officially confirmed by the RFU. The report said Hiddink would take up the reins immediately after the World Cup, which ends in July. The 59-year-old, who is currently coaching Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven and will lead Australia at the World Cup, had been amongst the favourites to replace Sven-Goran Eriksson as England boss. The Dutchman is known to be greatly admired by Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, who is a close friend of Mutko. Abramovich is financing an ambitious programme designed to improve Russian soccer and recently said of Hiddink: \"He is a very good coach. I like him very much.\" The Russians have been without a coach since November when Yuri Syomin quit after they failed to qualify for the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
