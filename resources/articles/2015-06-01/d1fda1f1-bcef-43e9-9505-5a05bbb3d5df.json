To conclude this 429th and final liveblog of the festival, here is the complete Alexis Petridis review of Wellah and the Who. Please do join me tomorrow morning, when I\u2019ll be liveblogging my breakfast. Thanks for your company all weekend, and have a good night\u2019s sleep. Chemical Brothers Mark Beaumont was there. He watched. But did he dance? Was his mind blown? Lasers, star guest and monster hits from the 90s; the Chemical Brothers have been studying the Closing Glastonbury manual hard. Of course they missed the section about the guests actually showing up, but Messieurs Simons and Rowlands don\u2019t need to resort to Ronson tactics to floor a field. Their crossover cultural clout may be diminished but they can still knock out a beat that sounds like two Crossrail tunnel borers having sex and their biggest tunes \u2013 Setting Sun, Hey Boy Hey Girl, Galvanize, Block Rockin\u2019 Beats \u2013 are rearranged into attack formation. Plus, at one point a giant mechanical robot descends from the rafters and shoots lights from its chest like one big bird-flip at Skrillex. The Who, who? Flying Lotus Our man with the experimental dance headset, Ben Beaumont-Thomas, was there \u2026 \u201cI heard that to be a legitimate artist, you had to play Glastonbury,\u201d Flying Lotus says jokingly as he opens his set. Legitimacy is assured with this excellent set that straddled straight-up trap, jazz, classic hip-hop, funk and the collapsing outer-edges of electronics. Set amid an angled cuboid net with projection-mapping flowing onto it, FlyLo switched from chunky hand-raisers into lovely dextrous soul, aided by bass guitar virtuoso Thundercat; a live reversion of Ice Cube\u2019s It Was A Good Day was an early highlight. They were later joined by George Clinton, playing their Kendrick Lamar collaboration, into Kendrick\u2019s King Kunta, via a splash of We Want the Funk. \u201cThis is my hero!\u201d, said a delighted FlyLo as the pair embraced at the end. With a jagged section of FlyLo\u2019s alter-ego Captain Murphy also included, this straddled the entire spectrum of funk \u2013 and all of it launched into the stars. When the Tommy medley goes into Listening to You \u2026 Is always the point in the Who show at which I go, \u201cJesus, this is bloody brilliant. Maybe I\u2019m wrong about Tommy and should go back to it again.\u201d So I do. And then I remember it\u2019s a bloody great rock opera, not a nice highlights medley calculated for maximum live impact. Slightly amazed \u2026 That hardly anyone in the crowd seemed to recognise Pinball Wizard from the intro, only getting it when the famous guitar pattern came in. I mean, it\u2019s a pretty famous song, isn\u2019t it? Most people have heard it from the beginning about 31,000 times, haven\u2019t they? Is it wrong \u2026 To admit that I really, really, really like You Better You Bet? Much more than Behind Blue Eyes or Love Reign O\u2019er Me \u2026 (though I do hope they don\u2019t bother with Eminence Front as the other representative of the last 35 years in the set). You\u2019d BETT-TAHHH! Ron Mael dancing in wellies! The Who \u2013 the Petridis verdict Even as we watch them on TV, in real life the Who are done. And Alexis has sent in his verdict, with the full review to follow. Daltrey can still swing a microphone around with considerable panache, but voice is rougher than it was. Even so, it still has a powerful belligerence about it that matches the sound of Townshend\u2019s guitar and brings out the distrust and paranoia at the heart of I Can See For Miles. The guitarist seems a bit underwhelmed by the set. \u201cIt could have been better,\u201d he says, before a version of Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again that sounds great. The band didn\u2019t get to soundcheck, he complains, although frankly no one would have known if he hadn\u2019t mentioned it. And then he raises an amused eyebrow at Kanye West\u2019s line about being the greatest rock star on the planet. American politics interruption, FFS For a moment we thought a US congressman had been onsite meeting with the Mael brothers to discuss farming \u2026 Roger \u2026 His voice is not what it used to be, that\u2019s for sure. But why would it be, given it\u2019s 50 years or so since many of these songs were recorded? I really don\u2019t mind, although, on I Can See for Miles, it\u2019s getting a bit peculiar. As elephantwoman puts it in the comments: \u201cIs Roger singing in the club singer style?\u201d The Kids Are Alright! Love this song. Last year, the Who had a press conference at Ronnie Scott\u2019s for their anniversary tour. I was in the front row, as Pete\u2019n\u2019Rog did a short acoustic set \u2013 to hear this played acoustically, from a few feet away, was incredibly poignant. Zak Starkey \u2026 Has been, by some distance, the best person behind the drums for any of the Who\u2019s configurations since Keith Moon died, hasn\u2019t he? The only one with anything approaching the same swing. And we\u2019re into the Seeker. May I ask which period of the Who you like best? My dream Who set would be almost entirely composed of pre-Tommy material, but I suspect I\u2019m pretty much alone in that (although Johnny Marr is another who feels the same). And we\u2019re off \u2026 With the Who highlights opening with Who Are You? Which is usually mid-set, but it is still very light on the footage, so perhaps they opened with it \u2026 The Who and 60s rock I\u2019m currently reading Psychedelia and Other Colours by Rob Chapman, to be published by Faber. The chapter on garage rock has a great exploration of how the US garage sound came to be formed, out of remnants of surf rock, R&amp;B and the British invasion. \u201cIn the great cultural ricochet of life, the garage bands were the sound of American beat groups imitating English beat groups who had been imitating American R&amp;B groups in the first place. That\u2019s not the full story by any means, but if the garage sound can be reduced to one common factor, then the great Anglo-American pursuit of roots on the rebound \u2013 a tendency that echoes back and forth across the Atlantic for most of the 20th century \u2013 constitutes a substantial part of the formula. The garage sound takes as its source material a range of English influences: roughly in order of prominence these were the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Beatles, the Who, Them, the Pretty Things, the Animals, the Kinks, the Dave Clark Five, the Zombies and the Troggs.\u201d That chapter also introduced me to this amazing record, which I\u2019d never heard before (I only know the pop versions by the Amen Corner and the American Breed), and which deserves to be considered the equal of Action Woman or Psychotic Reaction, for my money. FFS \u2026 Are sounding great on the iPlayer right now. And not just playing their album \u2013 but each others\u2019 songs, too. Chris Squire Here\u2019s our news report on the death of Yes bassist Chris Squire \u2026 \u201cChris Squire, co-founder of prog-rock band Yes and renowned bass guitarist, has died aged 67. Squire, who formed Yes with singer Jon Anderson in 1968, had been undergoing treatment for acute erythroid leukemia (a rare cancer of the blood and bone marrow) in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona. In a statement released on Sunday, fellow Yes band members described Squire as a phenomenal bassist and the \u201clinchpin\u201d that held the group together. \u201cIt\u2019s with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire. Chris peacefully passed away last night in Phoenix, Arizona,\u201d the band said. \u201cFor the entirety of Yes\u2019 existence, Chris was the band\u2019s linchpin and, in so many ways, the glue that held it together over all these years. Because of his phenomenal bass-playing prowess, Chris influenced countless bassists around the world, including many of today\u2019s well-known artists. Chris was also a fantastic songwriter, having written and co-written much of Yes\u2019 most endearing music, as well as his solo album, Fish Out of Water.\u201d\u201d You can read the whole story here. The Who update 2 As you were, 6Music are now moving around the stages but plan to return for the end of the Who\u2019s set. The Fall I didn\u2019t see them because I was watching Top Gear, but their set has brought the reminiscences out on Twitter \u2026 Some years ago, when my kids were in nursery, I was walking up Highgate Road to collect them after work. There was a fella, very drunk, slumped on the pavement against the wall of the Bull and Gate. Blimey, I thought, he doesn\u2019t half look like Mark E Smith. Fifty yards further on, I walked past the Forum, where the marquee read: \u201cTonight. Sold Out. The Fall.\u201d Wonder what that show was like. The Who update Stephen Cooper emails me to say they are live on the radio, on 6Music, right now, and they\u2019re playing the hits \u2013 My Generation out of the way already. In the meantime, I\u2019ve gone over to Chemical Brothers on the iPlayer for what appears to be a proper son et lumiere spectacular \u2013 Hey Boy, Hey Girl sounding just great right now. FKA twigs She\u2019s blown the mind of Ben Beaumont-Thomas. Here\u2019s a snippet. \u201cHalfway through FKA twigs\u2019 performance of Video Girl, I didn\u2019t think my Glasto music experience would be surpassed \u2013 it was an exquisite demonstration of tempo, speeding up and down like a panic attack coming in and out of control. Even the crane camera suddenly drew back startled from one burst of movement. But surpassed it was \u2013 over the subsequent set twigs showed off psychosexual theatre, futurist love song, and elemental dance that can be counted with the greatest art being made on the planet today. Her band were masterful, triggering drums and samples live - at one point this involved a percussion solo being played forwards, then backwards, in perfect symmetry.\u201d And here\u2019s the full review. Hello again! I went off and had my tea and watched the strange valedictory Top Gear with my son, and came back expecting to watch the Who on the iPlayer, only to discover \u2013 as many of you have \u2013 that it\u2019s highlights only. I\u2019ve left a message for their publicist to enquire why, but my guess would be that the Who, being a rock\u2019n\u2019roll band, can be unpredictable live \u2013 just like the Stones \u2013 and that maybe they only want the bits they know are good to go out. That\u2019s just a guess, mind. I\u2019ve seen them a few times, and I\u2019ve seen them be brilliant and I\u2019ve seen them be not quite on their game \u2013 that was certainly the case, I thought, for the second of their nights at the O2 earlier this year. What\u2019s interesting about the Who these days is that it\u2019s Roger Daltrey who\u2019s the advocate of doing unusual things with the setlist, whereas Pete Townshend would be happy to play the greatest hits and nothing but, because \u2013 he says \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get a whole lot out of playing live. It\u2019s Daltrey who got songs like the wonderful So Sad About Us into the setlist on the Who Hits 50 tour. I hope the highlights will encompass that stuff, as well as Who Are You? and My Generation and the like. That\u2019s it from me ... I am off to catch a bit of psychedelic electric funk fusion from Flying Lotus. Please allow Michael \u201cThe Man\u201d Hann to talk you through the closing stages of the festival. I can hear the distant sounds of the Who. In preparation for their set, I tried to source some snappy facts about the band. Unfortunately, all I could find was this website about a project which helps to facilitate access to medicines that meet unified standards of quality, safety and efficacy for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Enjoy. Here\u2019s a little summary of the general emotions at play in the hut: Time for T Now time for a quick take on Jamie T\u2019s set over at the Other stage (and here\u2019s Mark Beaumont\u2019s full review): \u2018I feel in the moment,\u2019 mutters Jamie T. Having donated his chirpy urban rap troubadour persona to Rat Boy, he\u2019s now in the business of being a tortured, serious artist. Catharsis abounds, be it in the form of furious punk screams of self-hate written after a bloke in the pub mocked him for not playing Glastonbury 2013, or admitting to stage fright before diving headfirst into Rabbit Hole. Covering hard drug abuse, unfaithfulness and insecurity, his new songs might be wrought with regrets and self-chastisement but they don\u2019t expect our sympathy. This gives his set an endearing self-help feel and making the eventual run of old rap pop hits \u2013 Sheila, Sticks \u2018n\u2019 Stones \u2013 such a wild release that the front row very nearly hugs him right into the mosh pit. Welcome back Mr T. FKA Twigs should be mid-way through her set at West Holts. Her stage show is always a visual feast, so hopefully she\u2019ll step it up for Glastonbury. The internet says that popular vampire impersonator Robert Pattinson is on site \u2013 maybe he will come on stage dressed as a twig. If he really loved her he would come on stage dressed as a twig. In the meantime, read this on the art of FKA Twigs\u2019 music videos dissected. We can confirm Wellah did quite wellah Paul Weller has finished now, off into the night like a leaf floating in the billowing winds (please see former disclaimer re similes) but here\u2019s a little taster of Alexis\u2019 review: \u201cWhat a night you\u2019ve got,\u201d says Paul Weller gruffly, not, one suspects, a man who\u2019s ever been much given to spending his weekends trudging through mud with glitter on his face carrying a flag that says PAUL AND SPUD\u2019S BARMY ARMY. \u201cNot just us but The Who as well.\u201d The audience roar: there are people here in FUCK KANYE T-shirts and a lot of blokes with Liam Gallagher hair. But these days, at least, Weller is nowhere near as musically conservative as some of his fans.\u201d While you\u2019re all here, what word do you think Paul Weller is saying in the above picture? My guess: shoe. Is Wellah doing wellah? Some people \u2013 such as Twitter\u2019s Andy Long \u2013 are demanding the hits. And, as if by magic, A Town Called Malice has begun. If you want to know more about the track, take a look at this vintage Guardian piece from 2012, which should explain how he made the famous Jam track. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my best songs, lyrically and in terms of what it means to people. I think it\u2019s still relevant. I don\u2019t think things have moved on too much since. I started playing it again because it\u2019s a great song \u2013 it\u2019s also entered the realms of being a great folk song. When we play the opening bars, you can\u2019t help being swept along.\u201d Theatre field: man-gorillas, trolls and gymnastic vaudevillian music hall chimpanzees Mark Beaumont got lost in the theatre field earlier. Here\u2019s some of the oddities he uncovered: \u201cFrom a distance, you\u2019d assume Catfish and the Bottlemen were conducting an affectionate meet and greet. Up close, it turns out to be a gaggle of trolls giving out free hugs. Only in the theatre field, a place where children pet convincing man-gorillas, gymnastic vaudevillian music hall chimpanzees hawk together a crowd for a risqu\u00e9 balloon-swallowing act and the headliners are a bezerker Balkan band from a village situated on a cliff at the end of the world. Ten minutes spent here is, all told, like a window into the minds of Super Furry Animals. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to this festival with our show for 13 years and we\u2019ve grown a very solid fanbase,\u201d says Flick Fernando of Bramble FM, a three-hour daily radio roadshow performed from a ramshackle caravan. \u201cIt\u2019s just three hours of some set pieces and then general chaos.\u201d What\u2019s the oddest thing you\u2019ve seen here this year? \u201cWell there\u2019s a giant turtle going past behind you right now.\u201d Wow, you can see that too?\u201d Lee Nelson update Yesterday\u2019s headline set might seem like a distant memory \u2013 especially considering all the Wellah that\u2019s going on on the Pyramid stage right now \u2013 but Lee V Ye still very much exists online. Nelson posted the below message eight hours ago: Whatever next? Will Taylor Swift interrupt a Lee Nelson standup show? Will Taylor Swift Kanye a Kanye gig? Will Kanye Kanye Kanye? Can\u2019t we all just get up on stage together and hold hands and be happy? (Again, apologies for any zealous hippy declarations that might occur over the next few hours. Tired, burnt, toilets.) Welcome to the early evening slot Hello! The rumours are true. It\u2019s time for me, Harriet \u201cHazza\u201d Gibsone to take over for a little bit. I will hopefully be feeding you updates on Paul Weller, Jamie T, FKA twigs and possibly 15 minutes of the Who, then it\u2019s back to Michael Hann, who will sail you into the late evening like a beautiful boat floating across a lake. (A preemptive apology for the many shoddy metaphors and similes that might crop up over the next two hours. It\u2019s Sunday night, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m sunburnt and I can\u2019t remember what a normal loo looks like.) And on that bombshell \u2026 I am handing over to Harriet Gibsone for a couple of hours. I\u2019ll be back for the Who on the telly later. But now I have to go and liveblog Clarkson\u2019s last Top Gear. (Not really.) Lionel Richie Is meeting with near universal approval from commenters below the line, people on Twitter and those who were there. Even though, on BBC2, he is currently performing We Are the World. Well-ah! Is on the iPlayer now, from the Pyramid stage. Many, many years ago, a friend of a friend was dating Weller. He came round to her house \u2013 so the story goes \u2013 just after having one of his more outr\u00e9 haircuts, the blond tints phase. She opened the door to him, shouted \u201cONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEEEEE!\u201d and burst out laughing. He demanded to know what she meant. \u201cWell, you look just like Eric Bristow.\u201d He turned on his heel and left. Bit of politics for you \u2026 John Harris has been writing about Glastonbury\u2019s political aspect \u2026 \u201cWhen writing about this festival, you inevitably have to push through a great forcefield of received opinion. Quiet apart from the idea of \u2018Glasto\u2019 as some ephemeral, hedonistic bunfight, there are all those arguments about what has happened to its spirit over the past 10 or 15 years, usually phrased in the form of sneers. The festival has changed, but then so has the world. Walking around its seemingly infinite expanse and comparing it to the event I first attended, in 1990 \u2013 the last year before the organisers let the police in, when one could freely buy breakfast from a hash-cake salesman before meeting friends who had got in for nothing \u2013 feels like contrasting very different versions of the same thing. But so does comparing the Britain of now with the country that was about to say goodbye to Margaret Thatcher. Most worthwhile elements of our culture grow and develop, occasionally in ways some people do not like.\u201d Read the whole piece here. Raving, she\u2019s raving! Kate Hutchinson spent Glastonbury investigating the nightlife \u2026 \u201cBeyond the headline acts and breaking acts, the reiki massages and the chai latte tents, these places are where Glastonbury truly comes alive and unbridled hedonism fizzes from every corner. In particular, the club curation across the festival feels like its strongest yet. I find myself, night after night, being drawn back to the Stonebridge Bar\u2019s discerning showcases. No matter what time it is, there\u2019s always music you\u2019ve never heard and can\u2019t wait to dive into.\u201d Read her whole piece here. Charli XCX Down in the comments thread, SonOfTheDesert observed: \u201cAs a thirtysomething man, there\u2019s probably something dodgy and wrong about watching Charli XCX, right?\u201d I wondered what he meant. And then I started watching her on the red button. She and her band are dressed in the style that one might describe as \u201cnaughty schoolgirl\u201d. And now I see exactly what he means. She\u2019s one of the enigmas of modern pop, is Charli. Really, she should have been a proper star by now, not given a mid-afternoon set in a tent. She\u2019s written and appeared on huge hits, but, for some reason, the public just aren\u2019t buying her as a solo act. It\u2019s a shame because her music is sparky and fun and deliciously disposable \u2013 proper modern bubblegum. Belle and Sebastian \u2026 Have been joined on stage by what look very much like interpretative dancers. Catch this on iPlayer now \u2026 The way it used to be \u2026 If you\u2019re of the school of thought that feels Glastonbury these days is entirely full of people called Jocasta and Tristram, and that it was only any good when you could end the weekend with your tent having been robbed three times, then enjoy this film from the 1986 festival \u2026 The goose drank wine Just watching a bit of Gaz Coombes on the red button, and he threw in \u201cthe goose drank wine\u201d from the Clapping Song. Which set me to thinking: which is the most reprehensible behaviour in the Clapping Song? Is it \u2026 Allowing a goose to drink wine Using a line so thin and frayed it broke Letting a monkey chew tobacco Not only that, but chewing it on the streetcar line Allowing the monkey to get choked Using a little rowboat to go to heaven Bribing a child through the promise of a rubber dolly Said child kissing a soldier Aunty dobbing in said child for kissing a soldier? Chemical Brothers Dorian Lynskey interviewed them for today\u2019s Observer \u2026 \u201cTo live your entire adult life in a kind of partnership, however much fun it\u2019s been, there still is that thing: how do you exist separately from another person?\u201d Ed Simons says. \u201cFor 20 years we\u2019d have to coordinate when we were going on holiday and things like that. There comes a time when you maybe want to \u2026\u201d He stops, reconsiders. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s longer than quite a lot of marriages. It\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s a great thing, but I wanted to do something which was just me.\u201d Read the full interview here. BBC 2 alert They\u2019re about to show the entire Lionel Richie set. Which might have been an absolute joy if you were there, after several days of God knows what, but I suspect I would rather scoop my eyes out with melon-ballers than watch this. Still, let\u2019s give it a go. Now, you may have spent your life wondering what a \u201ckaramu\u201d is (as in \u201cWe\u2019re going to party, fiesta / Karamu, for ever\u201d), so let me enlighten you, with the help of Wikipedia: A Karamu Ya Imani (Feast of Feasts) is a feast that takes place on December 31, the sixth day of the Kwanzaa period. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast, a Karamu. The Karamu feast was developed in Chicago during a 1971 citywide movement of Pan-African organizations. It was proposed by Hannibal Afrik of Shule ya Matoto as a community-wide promotional and educational campaign. The initial Karamu Ya Imani occurred on January 1, 1973 at a 200-person gathering at the Ridgeland club. In 1992, the National Black United Front of Chicago held one of the largest Karamu Ya Imani celebrations in the country. It included dancing, a youth ensemble and a keynote speech by NBUF and prominent black nationalist leader Conrad Worrill. I can\u2019t help feeling the song would be better if he promised to Caramac for ever. Future Islands Tshepo Mokoena went off to dance like Samuel T Herring \u2026 \u201cAre you also waiting for Seasons?\u201d one punter asks the other, three-quarters of the way through Future Islands\u2019 set. Ah, the one-hit gig. Such is the curse of finding viral meme fame, in this case for performing the song \u2013 full title: Seasons (Waiting on You) \u2013 on David Letterman last year. Frontman Samuel T Herring\u2019s bizarre, beautiful and unbridled dancing and chest-thumping first caught the internet\u2019s attention then, and is out in full force today. He ricochets from declaring this the synthpop band\u2019s 991st show to laughing at himself when he falls backwards over a monitor speaker after the opening song. But the stumble doesn\u2019t trip up the gig. Herring howls, growls and pants through a sunny and exuberant show, looking like your favourite uncle in his patterned shirt but letting out an orc\u2019s guttural roars. The crowd, initially a little bemused by his eccentricity, are in the palm of his hand by the end. They clap along to any four-to-floor drumbeat and reach out to grab that colourful shirt as Herring jumps off stage and finishes the show staring into the sunshine, pressed against the security barrier. It\u2019s the sort of passionate, full-on display that the Other stage was designed for.\u201d Your TV update What\u2019s on right now? BBC2 is on until 8pm with its early evening show presented by Mark Radcliffe and Lauren Laverne (with occasional interventions from Gemma Cairney). The red button offers Fuse ODG, Palma Violets and Spritualized. The iPlayer brings us alt-J (\u201cThe Mercury prize-winning musical theorists you can dance to,\u201d it says, unpromisingly), Perfume Genius, Future Islands, Charli XCX, Steel Pulse and Rae Morris. Food glorious food! What\u2019s Rachel Aroesti been eating? Here\u2019s her latest update. Chris Squire RIP In non-Glastonbury news, we\u2019re sad to say that Chris Squire, the bassist of Yes, has died. \u201cIt\u2019s with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire. Chris peacefully passed away last night in Phoenix Arizona, in the arms of his loving wife Scotty,\u201d Yes posted on their Facebook page. Read our 10 of the best from Yes here. And here\u2019s Chris Squire at work on his bass \u2026 It\u2019s the last night of the festival, and you\u2019ve got Proper Rock on the Pyramid stage in the shape of the Who and Paul Weller. Chemical Brothers headline the Other stage, while West Holts brings us Flying Lotus and FKA Twigs, while Ryan Adams and Goat colonise the Park stage. I\u2019ll be here this evening, watching on TV and the iPlayer, and bringing you reports from our army out about around the site. One confident prediction tonight: the Who won\u2019t be as divisive as Kanye West was last night. But first, can I implore you to have a look at this wonderful series of photographs \u2013 we\u2019ve had snappers following Glastonbury stories all weekend and the result are well worth a few minutes of your time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
