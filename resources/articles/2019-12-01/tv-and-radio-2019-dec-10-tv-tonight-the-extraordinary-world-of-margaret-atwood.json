With her dystopian novel of brutal gender divides, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, having been adapted for TV and becoming a global symbol for Women\u2019s Marches, the 80-year-old\u2019s fiction feels more relevant to real life than ever. Filmed over a year, this doc follows Atwood and her partner, Graeme Gibson (who died in September), as they jet to speaking engagements and meet devoted fans across the world, inspiring action. Ammar Kalia The Royal Variety Performance 2019 7.30pm, ITV Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett host the curtseying showbiz spectacular, introducing musical acts including Lewis Capaldi, Robbie Williams, the West End cast of Mary Poppins and the cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason. Laughs come from Frank Skinner and Kerry Godliman. Jack Seale Gold Digger 9pm, BBC One Beautiful house; nightmare family. In the penultimate episode of this racy psychological drama, we switch to the perspective of Julia\u2019s glowering youngest son, Leo.

Ellen E Jones Amazing Spaces: Northern Lights Adventure 9pm, Channel 4 George Clarke is in a festive mood for this special, exploring the architecture of snowy Finland. He travels from a traditional lodge in search of the northern lights, passing through treehouses, igloos and cabins on the way. But it\u2019s the caravan on skis that steals the show. AK Hoarders: Landfill in My Living Room 9pm, Channel 5 A supremely gloomy doc focusing on three chronic hoarders and their attempts to escape from lives lived under piles of bags and rubbish. Practical help is at hand, but there is insufficient exploration of the mental health issues that surely underpin these stories. Phil Harrison The Impeachment Show 9pm, Vice Donald Trump\u2019s potential impeachment has prompted a boom in podcasting, and now Vice joins in with this fast-paced weekly show visualising the politics and policy behind the movement. Host Michael C Moynihan covers all the bases, from pacing through DC to panel guests and explainers. AK Film choice The New Girlfriend, 12.05am, BBC Two Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s adaptation of a Ruth Rendell story is a darkly playful, sexy comedy in which Claire (Ana\u00efs Demoustier) and David (Romain Duris) bond intriguingly after the death of his wife and her best friend, Laura. There are touches of Otto Preminger\u2019s noir Laura in this sophisticated tale. Paul Howlett Sport Champions League Football: Red Bull Salzburg v Liverpool 5.55pm, BT Sport Extra.
