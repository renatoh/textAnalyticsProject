Struthers, together with the solicitor Rory Mac Neice, made an application on Downey\u2019s behalf, asking the BHA not to reciprocate the ban handed down by France-Galop in October. From conversations with officials since then, they believed the BHA was likely to remain neutral and might even be talked into supporting the application. But on Wednesday afternoon came word that, after taking advice from a barrister, the BHA had decided to oppose it. During a three-hour hearing on Thursday, Louis Weston argued on behalf of the ruling body that there had been no breach of natural justice in relation to Downey\u2019s original hearing in France and therefore his application must fail. Downey\u2019s only assistance in France had come from the jockey\u2019s agent Herve Naggar, who volunteered to make some representations on the rider\u2019s behalf. However, Weston argued that Downey had had the opportunity to hire a French solicitor and a translator. The PJA paid for two tests, one by a British lab and one in France, on hair samples provided by Downey which showed no evidence of cocaine. On that basis, Downey argued in France that any cocaine in his sample must have come from environmental contamination. But, Weston said, France-Galop concluded that a negative hair sample \u201cis not evidence of a complete abstinence from a drug\u201d. France-Galop declined to tell Downey what quantity of cocaine was found in his urine sample, a refusal which Mac Neice said significantly hampered the preparation of Downey\u2019s case. The verdict came as a double-whammy for Downey, as his suspension was originally stayed in Britain and will now run until July. However, it was immediately reciprocated by the Indian authorities, who prevented him from taking up a contract there in the autumn. Struthers had no complaint about the panel or its verdict, reserving his fire for the BHA\u2019s approach. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a guy who has very little financial means, who quite clearly, to me, hasn\u2019t done what he\u2019s now going to serve close to eight months for,\u201d he said. \u201cFor months we have been having conversations with the BHA about whether they would be neutral or would support it and yesterday they warned us they were going to oppose it. I perhaps shouldn\u2019t be but I\u2019m staggered. \u201cI think the BHA have put their relationship with France Galop over what\u2019s right. This has really stung me and it\u2019s stung Rory and it will change how we are able to work with that particular team at the BHA, going forward.\u201d A BHA spokesman said it was bound to reciprocate the ban under the terms of an international agreement, unless the rules of natural justice had been breached. \u201cThe BHA has made extensive efforts to assist the PJA and has acted in good faith throughout,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has included acquiring relevant information from France Galop on two occasions, as well as seeking expert evidence from scientific analysts on Mr Downey\u2019s behalf. \u201cFollowing the receipt in writing of the PJA\u2019s formal position on Monday and conversation with legal counsel, the BHA adopted the position that the suspension imposed by France Galop complied with the rules of French racing and the laws of natural justice, and had to be reciprocated. The independent disciplinary panel reached the same conclusion. \u201cThe BHA is aware of Mr Downey\u2019s financial situation and has made efforts to assist him and the PJA since the outset. However, we are signatories to the international agreement which is reflected in our rules.\u201d Protektorat reinstated as first Cheltenham winner of 2020 Protektorat has been reinstated as the first winner of the year at Cheltenham at an appeal hearing in London. The Dan Skelton-trained horse was first past the post in a novice hurdle on New Year\u2019s Day but was disqualified by the raceday stewards for causing interference a furlong from home to the runner-up, Imperial Alcazar. An appeal was made on the basis that Protektorat was ahead of Imperial Alcazar when he crossed to the stands\u2019 rail and in fact caused no interference. An appeals panel of the British Horseracing Authority appears to have accepted that, as it has allowed the appeal, though it did not offer any immediate reasons for the verdict. Harry Skelton, Protektorat\u2019s jockey, said he was delighted for the horse\u2019s owner, John Hales, a supporter of the Skelton yard. Fergal O\u2019Brien, trainer of Imperial Alcazar, accepted the outcome phlegmatically, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like penalties, you get some and you lose some.\u201d The stewards\u2019 inquiry was notable for being the first to involve Shaun Parker, newly appointed as the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s head of stewarding. He was one of three stewards who decided on the day that Protektorat should be demoted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
