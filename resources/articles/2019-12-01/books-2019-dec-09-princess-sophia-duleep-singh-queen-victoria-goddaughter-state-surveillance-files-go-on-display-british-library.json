But Princess Sophia Duleep Singh was also a suffragette and therefore marked down as a danger to the state. Surveillance files compiled on Duleep Singh will go on display for the first time at the British Library next year as part of its spring show exploring the history of the fight for women\u2019s rights. The library announced details of a show that will include about 180 objects, many going on display for the first time, including poems Sylvia Pankhurst wrote on rough prison toilet paper during her second spell in jail. There will also be banners loaned by Southall Black Sisters. Polly Russell, the curator, said it was a huge and timely subject. \u201cWe are trying to tell a really big story and to connect this current moment of activism to the history,\u201d she said. Duleep Singh, the daughter of an exiled Indian maharaja, lived in a royal apartment at Hampton Court Palace and went from enjoying debutante balls and dog breeding to more politically important pursuits as an active member of the Women\u2019s Tax Resistance League and the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union. This made her a nuisance and she was closely monitored by the police. The library holds surveillance files for Duleep Singh stretching from 1902 to 1920, some marked \u201cpolitical and secret department\u201d. One note from April 1913 records a telephone call to the office of Lord Crewe, the then secretary of state for India, by a prominent politician asking if anything could be done to \u201cstop her\u201d. A civil servant writes that there is no financial hold over Duleep Singh. \u201cIt is for the king to say whether her conduct is such as should call for her eviction from the lodging she now enjoys in Hampton Court by his majesty\u2019s favour,\u201d they write. Russell said the files gave \u201ca sense of just how unsettled people were \u2026 by her but also by suffrage as a whole. It was seen as a real problem for the state.\u201d One of the most prominent suffragettes was Sylvia Pankhurst, who served sentences in Holloway prison in 1913 and 1921. The exhibition will show examples of poems Pankhurst wrote on toilet paper during her second spell in jail, for sedition. \u201cIt speaks to this kind of insistence to be heard, even when you are in prison,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIt has a slightly [The] Handmaid\u2019s Tale feel to it.\u201d Curators debated whether to hold the exhibition in 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act but decided there were already many events taking place that year. Russell said: \u201cThe conversation did not end in 2018 \u2026 We have not yet entered a gender utopia.\u201d Russell said she was particularly pleased Southall Black Sisters, the campaign group that celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, was lending banners to the show. \u201cHonestly, I could have done the whole exhibition just on their banners,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are such an important organisation, campaigning in a really intersectional way before that word even existed.\u201d Russell said she wanted the exhibition to appeal to all generations and, while she prepared the show, a constant consideration was how she could excite her 15-year-old daughter. Russell recalled being 13 and receiving a book from her mother called Girls are Powerful. \u201cI was really embarrassed to be seen with it because, at the time, you wouldn\u2019t want to say you were a feminist, but that book was totemic for me \u2026 it shifted something in the way I saw the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI dream to hope that some people will have a moment like that at this exhibition.\u201d Unfinished Business: The Fight for Women\u2019s Rights is on at the British Library from 24 April to 23 August 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
