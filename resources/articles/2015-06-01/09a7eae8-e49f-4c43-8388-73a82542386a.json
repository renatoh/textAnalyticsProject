The 2015 list, naming the most influential LGBT people and published to coincide with Pride weekend this week places people in categories, rather than ranking them, as before. Several of those in the transgender category had only spoken publicly about transitioning in the past year; they includethe radio presenter Stephanie Hirst and the boxing promoter Kellie Maloney. Others, including the model Jacqui Gavin, the vice-chair of the Civil Service network a:gender, and lawyer Stephen Whittle, are long-time activists for trans rights. Ayla Holdom, a decorated RAF flight lieutenant, who is Britain\u2019s only openly transgender military pilot, has been honoured, as has Kate Stone, a scientist, who won her Press Complaints Commission fight against newspapers who featured her transgender status after a traumatic accident when she was gored by a stag. In the three years since the list began, when it was ranked, American women topped it. In 2012, the actor Jane Lynch, of the TV show Glee, was named the most powerful LGBT person in the world, followed by the talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres in 2013 and Laverne Cox, the American actor, from the drama series Orange is the New Black, in 2014, the first transgender person to do so. This year\u2019s list, compiled by SquarePeg Media via a panel and public nominations, focuses solely on influential LGBT Britons. They have been categorised into the sections of arts, campaigners, entertainers, politics, business leaders, workplace heroes, charity and community, transgender and influencers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t numbered the entries because we see each entry as being equally important to the LGBT+ community,\u201d the list\u2019s authors say in their introduction. \u201cThe list serves to encompass both those fighting for equality and people who are influential role models.\u201d Several transgender people featured are leading lights in other categories in the list. The Liberal Democrat Sarah Brown, who was the only openly transgender politician in the UK for a time, was listed in the transgender rather than politics category, but Paris Lees, a prominent trans rights activist and writer, was placed in the influencers category. The non-profit support groups Mermaids and Gender Trust, both of which deal with gender identity issues, were honoured in the charity and community section of the list."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
