Before today, Serena had gone 33 grand slam matches without losing. But amid racuous scenes at Roland Garros - in which the crowd's anti-American sentiment often spilled over into sheer nastiness - Henin-Hardenne stunned the defending champion 6-2, 4-6, 7-5. Henin-Hardenne, her classical backhand working to perfection, dominated the first set and, after conceding the second, held herself together in a nervous decider to seal an enthralling victory. Earlier, Clijsters recovered from a sluggish start to reach her second French Open final with a 7-5, 6-1 victory over Petrova. The Belgian, the second seed at Roland Garros, initially struggled to find her game. But with the Russian holding a set-point, Clijsters was the recipient of a huge slice of luck when her shot slapped into the net cord and bobbled over. From then on the unseeded Petrova - who was bidding to become the first Russian to reach a grand slam final since Olga Morozova did so here and at Wimbledon in 1974 - was demoralised and the match went Clijster's way. \"Those things can definitely turn matches around,\" she smiled as she left the court. \"Once I broke her back I felt really confident I could do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
