From next week it will increase gas and electricity prices by 14.2%, hard on the heels of rises of 5.9% in January 2004 and 12.4% the following September. It is the latest blow to hit consumers, already facing \u00a31-a-litre petrol prices, lacklustre economic growth and a moribund property market. British Gas, which supplies gas and electricity to 17 million customers, said it could no longer withstand the impact that rising oil prices are having on the wholesale gas market. Its managing director, Mark Clare, said: \"Spiralling world oil prices are now having an unprecedented impact on the cost of gas as the UK is now dependent on imports.\" Average annual gas bills will rise to \u00a3515 for customers who pay quarterly by cheque and \u00a3463 for those on direct debits. Average electricity bills will rise to \u00a3321, up 32.4% since early 2004. The gas and electricity watchdog, energywatch, said the price rises made a mockery of the company's television advertising campaign encouraging former customers to return. \"BG claim that many consumers have been returning, but energywatch believes that thousands of them will reject the latest increase by voting with their pockets and going elsewhere for their energy.\" Energy price specialist uSwitch said consumers will be better off switching to the current lowest cost provider, ScottishPower, which is offering capped bills until April 2007. The British Gas price rise follows increases by rivals over recent weeks. Powergen raised its gas bills by 11.9% (electricity by 7.2%) at the end of August while EDF recently announced rises of 15.9% for gas and 10.8% for electricity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
