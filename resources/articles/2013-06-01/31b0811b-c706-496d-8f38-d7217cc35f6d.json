The honest answer is no, it's not, because nothing is ever guaranteed in road racing. However, removing from the equation bad luck, illness and untimely mechanical incident, it does look highly likely that he'll join the exclusive club of yellow jersey winners. It's been a remarkably similar path to the one followed by Bradley Wiggins last year that Team Sky have laid out for the Kenya-raised Brit, and one he has progressed along with slightly less dominance but with a hint more ruthlessness and aggression. Where Wiggins could rely on his time-trial ability to distance his rivals and then subsequently control that situation Chris Froome's talents allow for a different tactic to produce the same result. A good time-trial result has still been essential to the Sky leader and the pace-setting that the support riders dictate on the mountains has remained at same high level but Froome's climbing abilities are superior to Wiggins in one vital area: he can produce an injection of pace which very few people can follow and that opens up a whole new set of possibilities, especially at this Tour where there are four mountain-top finishes. I can't remember ever seeing Alberto Contador struggle to stay with anyone uphill but when Froome accelerates even the two-time Tour winner can't cope and if the Spaniard does survive the initial burst he hasn't been able to digest Froome's cruising speed so he then gets burned off before the finish line. Contador's dilemma is if he doesn't latch on to Froome straight away he's not going to close any gap later on; for someone who called the shots in the mountains, that means trouble. And Contador is Froome's nearest rival. Everyone else who will be present at this Tour with GC pretensions has looked strictly second rate when the chips are down. All perfect then? Well, not quite. When it comes to negotiating the hectic flatter stages Froome doesn't have the same natural ability to maintain his position that Wiggins has. He loses places when the fighting starts and slips back so he'll need to rely on his team mates to keep him out of trouble in those situations. He doesn't quite command the same respect as Wiggo either \u2013 that might be his more reserved nature coming through \u2013 but I get the feeling the other guys will pounce on him at the first sign of weakness. Last but not least, Froome will need to handle the media better than he did last year. He can't afford to get sidetracked in any bickering, or debates on his team leader status compared with the outgoing champion Wiggins. That will be a constantly recurring topic and if he doesn't stay focused on just doing the race then the pedalling part of his day will be the easiest part to deal with. Still the one to beat ? Oh yes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
