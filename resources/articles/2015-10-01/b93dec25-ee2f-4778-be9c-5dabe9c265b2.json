As women\u2019s rights and gender equality were put centre stage at the Women in the World event in London on Friday, May said she did not believe the difficulty in balancing work and family life was discouraging women from becoming MPs. But she suggested that the most visible parts of politics, such as the adversarial prime minister\u2019s questions, could put women off. \u201cWomen will look at the most-seen part of politics, which is the rough and tumble, and think they can can apply their talents elsewhere,\u201d she said. But she said being a woman had not held her back. \u201cEvery time I tried to do something, I tried never to think that if it failed it was because I was a woman. I tried to think: what questions didn\u2019t I answer?\u201d Sturgeon applauded the Sisters Uncut protest at the red carpet opening of the film Suffragette, which was prompted by government cuts to domestic violence services. \u201cDomestic violence is a symbol of gender inequality, but is also a cause of gender inequality,\u201d she said, highlighting current moves by the Scottish parliament to make domestic violence an aggravating factor in sentencing. In a tense exchange with interviewer Sir Harold Evans, where he said police had to be cautious in case domestic violence calls were \u201cvexatious\u201d, Sturgeon said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any call from a woman reporting abuse should be treated as vexatious. We are seeing the rate of prosecution go up very sharply. There\u2019s a massive effort going into this and that is right and proper. We need to drive forward gender equality, but we won\u2019t do that if women are held back by violence and abuse.\u201d Sturgeon said she believed quotas in politics were necessary to speed up the pace of change. \u201cI don\u2019t want my nine-year-old niece to still be fighting these battles,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is good for any of us to underuse the talents of 50% of the population.\u201d After May said she felt women often needed a \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d before they felt confident enough to go into politics, the SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black said she had previously had no political ambitions. \u201cThere was real momentum after the referendum,\u201d the 21-year-old MP said, revealing she had been so relaxed on the day of the election that she stayed away from the count, watching The Big Bang Theory on TV at home. \u201cI had to stand because there was no one else willing to do it. They guilt-tripped me into putting myself forward,\u201d she said. Westminster was desperately lacking diversity \u2013 in gender, background and ethnicity, Black said. \u201cOtherwise it becomes a stale, middle-class, middle-income boys\u2019 club. That\u2019s what Westminster is \u2013 it still has that boys\u2019 club feeling to it. It\u2019s alive and well in Westminster.\u201d The need for dramatic action was clear, said Catherine Mayer of the Women\u2019s Equality party, pointing out that there are currently more male MPs than the historical total of female parliamentarians. There are also, she added, \u201cmore men named John leading FTSE 100 countries in the UK than there are women\u201d. Defending the need for a single issue party, she said the pace of change had been so slow as to be glacial. \u201cThe one language political parties understand is the power of the ballot box.\u201d The star-studded two-day event was organised by Tina Brown, former editor of the New Yorker, and started with a standing ovation for women from the Ford car plant in Essex whose battle for equal pay in the late 60s was immortalised in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham. The event concluded with the first interview with Tor Pekai Yousafzai, the mother of Nobel prize winning girls\u2019 rights campaigner, Malala Yousafzai. The opening night on Thursday saw actor Meryl Streep urging women not to give up the fight for equal rights. It also featured Germany\u2019s first female defence minster, Ursula von der Leyen, a mother of seven who as labour minster introduced shared parental leave in Germany, calling for men to join the struggle. She said: \u201cIf you fight for women\u2019s rights, you need modern men as your allies.\u201d There were calls for women to be more \u201cdisobedient\u201d, with author Kathy Lette saying that any woman describing herself as a post-feminist had \u201ckept her Wonderbra and burned her brains\u201d. The audience also heard from barrister Charlotte Proudman, who became the focus of a worldwide media frenzy after she spoke out about a sexist message she had received on social networking service LinkedIn. She said trolling was a way to stop women speaking out. \u201cThe backlash was something I never expected. I had death threats, threats to separate my head from my body. I was called a bitch and a ball-busting munter. It is still going on. And it is simply because I challenged vested male interests and that is something I refuse to apologise for.\u201d Nicole Kidman, who is currently playing Rosalind Franklin \u2013 a key member of the team that discovered DNA\u2019s helix structure \u2013 in the West End play Photograph 51, also spoke. She revealed that the night she won an Oscar for The Hours in 2003 was the \u201cloneliest I have ever felt\u201d. Speaking candidly about her emotional state after her divorce from the actor Tom Cruise, she said: \u201cTo be completely honest, I was running away from my life. I couldn\u2019t handle the reality of my life. Out of that came work that was applauded and that was interesting for me.\u201d She said she believed there was \u201cabsolutely\u201d still a shortage of great female roles on stage and screen, but it could not simply be a matter of rewriting male characters for women. \u201cLet\u2019s tell the female stories too. Let\u2019s tell the story of Rosalind Franklin, of the suffragettes \u2013 there are so many extraordinary stories to be told.\u201d In a panel discussion about selfies and low self-confidence, psychologist Susie Orbach said body dislike was \u201cstealing the childhood\u201d of girls, who were \u201clearning about display as the way to interact with the world rather than contribution\u201d. She warned that multinational companies were preying on the insecurities of a generation that \u201chas to be a brand that we sell\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just affecting girls, but boys,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can get as many boys to hate themselves as girls, there is a lot of money to be made.\u201d From the world of science, Dr Margaret Aderin-Pocock \u2013 who joked that there were now fewer dinosaurs expressing disbelief that a black woman could also be a scientist \u2013 urged women to throw themselves into the limelight. \u201cThere are opportunities out there, but if we don\u2019t take them, then we waste them,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
