Those who, like myself, adored it when it was released may well find themselves reacting more equivocally to its successor. The programme, rather than Kermes's singing, is ultimately the problem. Culled from Vivaldi's stage works, it cannily examines the nature of profane love by juxtaposing arias about obsessive passion with numbers dealing with desire for political power at its most unscrupulous. The material, however, is uneven, to put it mildly. There's an aria from La Fede Tradita e Vendicata that ranks among the most beautiful things ever penned, while Cleopatra's distraught outburst from Il Tigrane reveals a major musical psychologist at work. Too little of the rest of it is inferior Vivaldi, however, and the uninitiated may end up with the impression that he was predominantly a four-square composer, which is far from the truth. Singing with a mixture of flame-like tone, flamboyant ease and astonishing technical precision, Kermes remains a truly awesome artist, though. Andrea Marcon conducts the Venice Baroque Orchestra with panache, dexterity and bags of charm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
