A terse one-sentence statement on the official microblog of the film The Eight Hundred this week announced that the film\u2019s 5 July premiere will be cancelled and \u201ca new release date will be announced later\u201d. The film had already been pulled the day before its opening-night premiere at the prestigious Shanghai International Film Festival earlier this month, apparently because it glorifies the second world war heroism of the Communists\u2019 rival Nationalist party, according to Chinese-language media reports. The ruling Nationalist party fought alongside the Communists against Japan during the second world war, but retreated to Taiwan after it lost the Chinese civil war in 1949. Chinese propaganda emphasises the Communist party\u2019s valiant role in the war against Japan but portrays the Nationalist party as having had a marginal and passive role. The cancellation of The Eight Hundred came after a group of retired party cadres and conservative figures, including high-ranking former military personnel, lashed out at the movie in a seminar on films on 9 June. Such retired officials still exercise influence over ideological matters. An article on a Maoist website said the 17 participants at the China Red Culture Research Association seminar unanimously regarded the film as an \u201cinappropriate\u201d tribute to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The film tells the story of how hundreds of Chinese Nationalist soldiers bravely defended a warehouse against Japanese forces for several days to cover Chinese troops retreating west during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. While the act of bravery of the so-called \u201c800 heroes\u201d should be remembered, the article quoted the former cadres as saying, the film\u2019s glorification of the Nationalist party\u2019s heroic role was unacceptable. \u201cThe class oppression within the Nationalist army, its officers\u2019 misdeeds and its evil oppression of the people are nowhere to be found [in the film], as if the Nationalist army was the real people\u2019s army,\u201d they said. \u201c[The film] used fragments of history to cover up the reality and embellish the Nationalist\u2019s war efforts.\u201d They criticised the prominent display of the Nationalist party\u2019s flag in a moving scene where the soldiers defend the flag on the warehouse roof. The film \u201cshould not so passionately promote the \u2018dignity\u2019 and the \u2018sanctity\u2019 of the Nationalist flag ... This is an insult to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d The Communist party rigorously guards its version of history, which it regards as the source of its legitimacy. In a famous speech made in 1942, Mao Zedong stressed the need for art to subordinate itself to politics. \u201cLiterature and art are subordinate to politics and yet in turn exert enormous influence on it,\u201d the future Chinese leader said. \u201cIdeological warfare and literary and artistic warfare, especially if these wars are revolutionary, are necessarily subservient to political warfare.\u201d President Xi Jinping appears to share Mao\u2019s view of ideological control; in 2013 an internal party edict known as Document No. 9 ordered cadres to tackle seven \u201csubversive\u201d influences on society, including \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d \u2013 a move that effectively bans any versions of history other than the official one. \u201cArts and culture are part of the propaganda and ... more and more, literature is at the service of the party especially when it tackles historical subjects,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Beja, research emeritus professor at the Centre for International Studies and Research at Sciences-Po in Paris. \u201cThere is no way that through literature, TV or films you can change the historical interpretation by the party. \u201cThe victory over Japan is part of the legitimacy of the Communist party, to talk of the heroism of the Nationalist party is something akin to being a traitor,\u201d he said. Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said the cancellation of the film shows that ideological control is tightening in China and no independent view of history is allowed. \u201cThe Chinese authorities suffer from a sense of insecurity, and in order to be politically safe, new and innovative ideas are not accepted even in the fields of the film industry and the creative arts,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
