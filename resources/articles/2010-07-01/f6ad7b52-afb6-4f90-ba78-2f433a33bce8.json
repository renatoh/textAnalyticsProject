Powell was quicker out of the blocks but the triple Olympic champion got into his stride to win in 9.84sec, a record for the Paris meeting, and in only his second race back following an achilles injury. Powell finished 0.07sec adrift of Bolt and Yohan Blake completed the Jamaican clean sweep of the medals, finishing third in a personal best time of 9.95. \"It wasn't the best race I've ever had in my life,\" said Bolt, who had first returned to competition in Lausanne on 9 July. \"My first part was awful. At the 50 metres, I thought he [Asafa] had me. I had to work a little bit harder to get back in the race.\" Bolt, the world record holder in the 100 and 200, pulled away in the final metres to stay unbeaten for his 14th consecutive sprint victory in 100m finals. \"It's all about determination,\" said Bolt. \"I want to be the best, to stay on top. When you run against the best, it always pushes you to do your best all the time. I'm happy, I escaped injuries and I won the race. \"I need to work on a few things because I was kind of off this time but I have two weeks to go to Jamaica and try to get it done.\" Powell said he struggled throughout the race and was dissatisfied with his effort after running 9.91. \"I felt some problem in my groin area and I had to fight till the end,\" he said. \"But you know, it happens sometimes and it will get better. I'll get him next time around. It was just a bad race tonight but it will get better.\" Bolt and Powell, who share the fastest time this year at 9.82sec, met for the first time this season. Powell is the last man to have beaten Bolt in the 100, and that came two years ago in Stockholm. Bolt added that he is not yet fully recovered from the achilles injury and would not be back to peak condition for another three weeks. Jeremy Wariner set a season best of 44.49sec in the 400m, the 2004 Olympic champion winning easily ahead of Jermaine Gonzales of Jamaica (44.63) and Belgium's Jonathan Borlee (44.77). \"It feels great. I'm getting back to where I was a few years ago,\" the American said. Phillips Idowu was fourth in the triple jump won by the Cuban David Giralt, the British world champion producing a best effort of 17.20m. A strong British team won the men's 4x100m relay with the former Olympic champion Mark Lewis-Francis bringing the quartet home in 38.70sec, 0.05sec ahead of the Italians."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
