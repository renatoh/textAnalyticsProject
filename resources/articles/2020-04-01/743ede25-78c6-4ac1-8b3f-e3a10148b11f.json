The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism. But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission\u2019s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill. Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill. \u201cDisasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201d Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries. \u201cOf course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,\u201d Beinecke said. Richard Sears, the commission\u2019s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but \u201cthere are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water\u201d. \u201cEverybody has to stay vigilant,\u201d Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk. Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization. In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling. The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig. Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry\u2019s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors. Trump has pushed an agenda of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d, which critics say encourages industry to take risks. A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US \u2013 more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico. His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE\u2019s director repeatedly calling them \u201cpartners\u201d. \u201cBSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,\u201d the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017. Internal emails suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns. Staffers at BSEE who spoke anonymously to E&amp;E News depict a \u201cbroken\u201d agency run by Angelle, who is a former Louisiana politician and longtime supporter of the Gulf oil industry. \u201cBSEE is focused on ensuring energy development is conducted in a safe and smart manner,\u201d a spokesman, Sandy Day, told the Guardian, maintaining that the industry was vastly different from what it was 10 years ago. \u201cBSEE is committed to its mission to promote safety, protect the environment and conserve offshore resources through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement,\u201d said Day, adding: \u201cSafety is a top priority for the Trump administration\u2019s oversight of OCS [outer continental shelf] operations, and BSEE has significantly increased safety performance in comparison to the Obama administration through increased inspections and more effective use of data.\u201d Meanwhile, drillers have moved farther and deeper offshore, pursuing wells with enough oil to produce for decades, known in the industry as \u201celephants\u201d. Low oil prices \u2013 from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking \u2013 haven\u2019t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in deep water. \u201cOffshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. \u201cThese are being drilled in deep water and they\u2019re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they\u2019re being drilled in more complex geology.\u201d One study found that for every 100ft deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents increase 8.5%. The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the Gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called \u201cBlind Faith\u201d, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the Gulf floor. Deans called the current regulatory approach \u201can honor system\u201d that \u201csmacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw\u201d in the BP blowout. \u201cDefinitely, it could happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.\u201d Smaller-scale incidents that don\u2019t make the news occur frequently in the Gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data reviewed by the environment campaign Oceana. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time. Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump\u2019s changes have undermined offshore safety. \u201cMany steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago \u2026 I felt comfortable \u2013 not that the risk was reduced to negligible \u2013 but that we were in better shape now than we were,\u201d Boesch said. \u201cI\u2019ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.\u201d Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes. Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the \u201creal motivator\u201d for industry was \u201cthe image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP\u201d. \u201cFrom the large operators, I\u2019ve seen a big change in safety culture,\u201d Williams said. But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the Gulf of Mexico too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training. John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said: \u201cThe next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard \u2026 like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Amos said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
