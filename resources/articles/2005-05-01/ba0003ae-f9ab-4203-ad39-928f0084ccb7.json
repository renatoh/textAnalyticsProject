George Osborne, shadow chancellor, said: \"Every year Gordon Brown promises to cut red tape on business and every year he increases it. British businesses saddled with \u00a340bn of extra regulation under Labour will be very sceptical.\" He was reacting to an announcement from Mr Brown of his aim to introduce bills to reduce form-filling for firms and cutting business regulators from 29 to seven. \"So while some of the proposals he's put forward are welcome - indeed, many come straight from the Conservative manifesto - we will see whether anything in reality actually happens,\" Mr Osborne said. John Cridland, the CBI deputy director general, said he was keen to see whether Mr Brown delivered. \"[We] will judge its success on the quality of future dealings with the new 'improved' version.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
