'The buy-to-let market is particularly strong.' \u00b7 In Hereford and surroundings, a 'shortage of quality town and country property is still pushing prices up,' says Paul Morris of Jackson Estate Agents. \u00b7 In Nuneaton, 'Reality is starting to bite over \u00a3200,000 where sellers realise the need for competitive pricing if they are serious about selling,' says Roy Hawkins of Hawkins. \u00b7 Wolverhampton is still seeing 'keen interest and inquiries', says surveyor Stuart Swash. 'There is some resistance if asking prices are too bullish.' \u00b7 The average property takes 3.9 weeks to sell after 8.9 viewings and fetches 96.1 per cent of the asking price, according to Hometrack. \u00b7 The number of properties for sale is down 18 per cent over the last year, according to the Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (RICS). \u00b7 Rents average \u00a3395 per month for one-bedroom flats, says the RICS.
