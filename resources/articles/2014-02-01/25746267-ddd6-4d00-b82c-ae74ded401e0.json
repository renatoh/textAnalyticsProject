Hallinan had no obvious rivals for her position \u2013 specialist wing-defences are rare. Expressionless and stoic on the court, Hallinan had carved out a comfortable niche in the Diamonds line-up by unselfishly keeping the wing-attack off the circle and out of the game; thereby setting up backline defenders for spectacular intercepts. The 180cm Victorian debuted for the Australian Diamonds in 2009 at the age of 23. She quickly owned her WD position and took out the award for best Diamonds player in her debut year. Hallinan was selected in the 2010 Commonwealth Games team; she was part of the starting seven for the grand final, a match Australia lost in an overtime heart-breaker. In that game, Hallinan was out-manoeuvred by flashy Silver Fern Liana Leota and was benched before the final whistle. The match and her performance had far-reaching consequences \u2013 Hallinan was a shock omission from the Diamonds 2011 January tour of Jamaica. Coach Norma Plummer instead decided to run a random assortment of players in her position against Jamaica, most of whom had never played a test match at wing-defence. \u201cNorma was very honest with her feedback,\u201d Hallinan told the Guardian. \u201cI just didn\u2019t win back enough ball for the team, I was too safe, I needed to take more risks.\u201d Then, in a decision Hallinan describes as \u201cdevastating\u201d \u2013 national selectors left her out of the victorious 2011 World Cup squad. Rarely had a player fallen out of favour so rapidly with Australian netball selectors; Hallinan\u2019s day in the sun had seemed to come to a premature end. 2010 was not a good year for Bianca Chatfield either. At 187cm, Chatfield was a good head above her rival Australian defenders when she first entered the fray as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 teenager. In 2001 and at the age of 18, she became one the youngest people ever to play for the Diamonds. From 2004-09, the Diamonds experimented with 13 different circle defenders \u2013 Chatfield was always in the 12 and often in the starting line-up. But the rise of Laura Geitz and Susan Fuhrmann spelt trouble for the Melbourne Vixens captain. In 2010, for the first time in six years, Chatfield was dumped from the side \u2013 eventually missing the cut for both the Commonwealth Games and World Cup sides. \u201cDeep down I knew it was coming [being dropped from the team],\u201d Chatfield told the Guardian. \u201cI had travelled with the team to Scotland early in 2010 and started to get the feeling the coaches were looking at others in my position, but you never really know, so it was an element of shock and reality that hit hard when the team was announced.\u201d Remarkably \u2013 the pendulum would swing back widely for both women. Fast forward to 2013, Chatfield and Hallinan are back in the Australian Diamonds starting seven. Last year the pair guided their team to one the nation\u2019s best series victories over the Silver Ferns. \u201cAfter the initial hurt and frustration of being left out of the 2011 team, I decided that it was time to step out of my comfort zone, to challenge myself and to make some drastic changes\u201d Hallinan told the Guardian. \u201cThere is no secret to bouncing back. I wanted to be in the team more than I wanted to give up,\u201d she said Chatfield told the Guardian taking time of out of international netball allowed her to \u201cclear her head\u201d. Eventually, Chatfield worked on becoming a smarter, fitter player through \u201ca combination of improving my fitness and vertical jump as well just being a better all-round player\u201d. Chatfield also shifted out to goal defence, a move which reinvigorated her career. For Hallinan, the changes were more radical. After the 2011 season, she decided to move states \u2013 leaving the Melbourne Vixens club after many years to join the Adelaide Thunderbirds. Hallinan sat down with new coach Jane Woodlands-Thompson to identify gaps in her game \u2013 strength, aggression and power were seen as the big issues a rigorous training program was implemented. Eventually, Hallinan not only resecured her place in the Diamonds starting seven, she took out Netball Australia awards for player of the year last year and was named as the 7th best netballer on the planet by the Guardian netball panel. But comebacks are never simple. Across the other side of the globe and former Wales captain Billy Pritchard is returning to Team Bath after six years away from the ZEO UK Netball Superleague. At 35 and two children later, getting back on court at top level is no mean feat. \u201cI started to train with Team Bath, taking it week by week to see if I could still compete at that level. Luckily the body is still holding out and I now have the added benefit of experience and I love playing the game more than I ever have\u201d Pritchard told the Guardian. Pritchard has not ruled a return to the fast-improving Welsh national side for the first time since 2007 and despite a solid array of players, her spot in the seven seems relatively unencumbered. An easy road to the starting seven is not a luxury either Hallinan or Chatfield know much about. Julie Corletto may well return to the Diamonds side for this year\u2019s Commonwealth Games; either GD or WD might be given back to Corletto in the big matches. Based on past form, Hallinan will be galvanised by the challenge of keeping her place in the Diamonds\u2019 starting line-up. \u201cFor me, it is always about looking for the opportunities to be better, not bitter. On the toughest of days, hard work and discipline is the key to having confidence that you can achieve whatever you put your mind to. I am prepared to do make sacrifices and do whatever it takes to best represent the Diamonds and the Thunderbirds\u201d Hallinan said.
