Using a technique called laser adaptive optics they modelled overhead atmospheric turbulence, and modulated a telescope mirror to eliminate both sub-celestial twinkle and the primary justification for one of the English language's most loved nursery rhymes. Its second line, \"How I wonder what you are\", is a statement of the universal curiosity that fuels science. Galileo launched evidence-based experimental science 400 years ago by training a telescope on the moon, planets and stars, but he couldn't learn much about the stars because of that obscurant twinkle. Subsequent stargazers understood the optical distortion that accompanies atmosphere. They overcame it first with big reflector telescopes on high mountains, then with space-based cameras, and finally with optics that adjusted a terrestrial mirror surface to eliminate the twinkle of a whole bunch of stars. In the same four centuries, astronomers pioneered the understanding of stellar fabric and light, and therefore of matter and energy. They found that a star was not just \"like a diamond in the sky\" but the source of 90 elements, including crystalline carbon, and the atmosphere, and perhaps even vast clouds of microscopic diamonds in interstellar space. That's a lot of payoff from a quizzical little twinkle, up above the world so high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
