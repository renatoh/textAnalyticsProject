The 22-year-old left-hander won his first England call-up for the tours of Bangladesh and India after a golden season with Northamptonshire and the Lions, scoring 2,706 runs in the process, scooped a string of awards and was instrumental to his county lifting the T20 Blast trophy. Despite a strong start, registering two half-centuries as England beat Bangladesh 2-1 in the one-day series, the final month of Duckett\u2019s time away from home was spent facing throwdowns from the batting coach, Mark Ramprakash, after a technical glitch was mercilessly targeted by the India spinner Ravi Ashwin. Three failures meant he was hooked from the stage two Tests into the 4-0 series pasting. Now back in England and gearing up for the Lions tour to Sri Lanka next month, Duckett has conceded his torment against Ashwin, who exploited his propensity to sit back in the crease on leg stump and play with half a bat away from his pads, has prompted him to rethink his approach to playing spin in Asia. \u201cIt was extremely tough, not just for me but all the guys out there in India for the Tests. Getting dropped towards the end of the trip has got to be a low,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, there are technical issues. I went out there as a good player of spin \u2013 that\u2019s what people were saying \u2013 and coming back, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ve got plenty to work on. It\u2019s more that I hadn\u2019t faced world-class spinners in those conditions. \u201cDuring the series, it\u2019s extremely tough to play around with [your technique] when you realise you\u2019ve got a problem. I\u2019ve never had that experience before, needing to find a way to score runs. That was extremely tough. But the best thing at the time was that, when I did get dropped, it took a bit of pressure off me and I could go and work with Ramprakash in the nets and play around with a few things. I definitely think, in a strange way, I\u2019ve come back as a better player of spin.\u201d Another lesson for Duckett came in learning to switch off from the increased scrutiny at international level, having convinced himself before his final innings in Visakhapatnam \u2013 a 16-ball duck \u2013 that he was going to be dropped whatever the outcome. \u201cIf I got another chance to play for England, [I don\u2019t think] I\u2019d necessarily listen to as many people outside of cricket. It is easy to go \u2018Hang on, I\u2019m a rubbish player of spin\u2019. If people are talking about it, then you sometimes believe it. \u201cIn India, Bangladesh, you have a lot of time to sit in your room \u2013 there\u2019s not as much to do \u2013 and you can\u2019t really get away from it. You go on your phone and your name\u2019s there [on social media], and you almost think \u2018I\u2019m getting dropped\u2019 before you even are. Going into that last innings, maybe my mindset was already \u2018I\u2019m gone here\u2019 \u2013 rather than \u2018No, I\u2019m going to get 130 and draw us this game, be a hero\u2019.\u201d Scoring 130 would have meant going against team orders, however, with Cook telling his players to drop anchor as England looked to block out for 150 overs in pursuit of the draw. While this one-size-fits-all approach may have suited the captain and his opening partner, Haseeb Hameed \u2013 as demonstrated by their three-hour vigil on the fourth evening \u2013 it left a shot-maker like Duckett playing for his place in an unfamiliar way as England, two wickets down going into the final morning, were all out shortly after lunch. He said: \u201cCookie spoke to us \u2013 \u2018we\u2019re going to try to bat all day here, whether it\u2019s 20 runs off 160 balls\u2019. That isn\u2019t my game. I did try to do what we were asked. On another day, my way of batting for the draw is actually trying to get 120 off 160. It\u2019s tough just trying to prod back. \u201cI was on the verge of getting dropped \u2026 I did what the captain said. On another day, you can be a hero and get a 30 off however many balls, but I ended up trying to sweep one which wasn\u2019t there. It was a different mindset to what I normally am \u2013 on another day, I might commit to that and nail it. When the England captain asks for a group to do something, and everyone buys into it, you do it really.\u201d When Cook told Duckett he had been dropped for the third Test, he went on to ask how the team could better prepare players for the step up from county cricket, to which he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t really think you can. Because county cricket, the pressure of that, is nothing like when you\u2019re playing for England, with however many people watching you, judging you. \u201cIn county cricket last year, I think half my innings were below 10. For England, if you get four or five low scores, you\u2019re thinking \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to get dropped here\u2019. All it takes is to go on and get a hundred or 150, and then you start to believe it yourself. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen out there.\u201d Duckett, who missed out on the one-day tour of India after Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales returned from missing the Bangladesh trip for security reasons, looks set to focus on white-ball cricket in the short term, having been left out of the two A Tests between the Lions and Sri Lanka. He will join the second string for the five 50-over matches that follow before a spell playing for Islamabad United in the Pakistan Super League. With England likely to allow a number of players to miss the two one-day internationals against Ireland in May to feature in the Indian Premier League, Duckett could yet get another chance at international level soon. \u201cThey\u2019re an unbelievable one-day squad and it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to break into that side,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I do get another chance, then I hope I can turn those 60s against Bangladesh into a hundred and show I can do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
