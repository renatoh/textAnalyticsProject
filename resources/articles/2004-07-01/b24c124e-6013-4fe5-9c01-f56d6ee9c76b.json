However remote the chance of a settlement with Israel may appear a decade after the Oslo Accord, it still requires a viable authority to win international support and rally its people. And the already grievous burden imposed on Palestinians will become intolerable if the regime falls apart. Yesterday Mr Arafat gave a little ground by withdrawing the appointment of his cousin Moussa Arafat as security chief but this only removes a peripheral provocation. In spite of rising Palestinian demands for reform, there has been no progress since last year's anti-corruption protests that forced Mr Arafat to appoint a new government - whose second prime minister Ahmad Qurei was still trying to resign yesterday. A measure of the crisis was criticism of Mr Arafat by the UN coordinator Terje Roed-Larsen who is more used to denunciations by Israel for his alleged Palestinian bias. The Palestinian authority, he said, had made no progress on \"its core obligation to take immediate action on the ground to end violence and combat terror, and to reform (itself)\". He referred to a lack of political will, to the government's \"paralysis\" and blamed Mr Arafat for the authority's \"diminished credibility\" abroad. Instead of absorbing this, the Arafat camp said petulantly that Mr Roed-Larsen would be \"not welcome\". There is no doubt that Mr Arafat's enforced isolation by Israeli design has heightened all the most negative aspects of his rule, from the toleration of corruption among close followers to the instinctive resort to wheeling and dealing instead of decisive action. Another factor is the prospect of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza which has brought into the open conflict between old and younger cadres in the dominant Fatah party as they jockey for position. To blame Israel for encouraging Mr Arafat's worst tendencies will only serve as an excuse for his continuing failure to reform, but neither should the Israeli government be tempted to see Palestinian disarray (as the Jerusalem Post claimed yesterday) as \"a good scenario for Israel (with) a divided enemy\". Division will lead to more terror. Israel must offer more incentives for moderation. As Mr Roed-Larsen says in an otherwise pessimistic report, a majority on both sides still hopes for reconciliation and peace. Real commitment to reform by Mr Arafat, an unqualified pledge to end the Israeli occupation, and the mutual renunciation of violence, are the only way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
