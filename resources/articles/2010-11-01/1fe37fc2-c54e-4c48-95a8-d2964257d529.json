We hope you've got a nice evening of Scrabble planned because you aren't going to want to stick around for this. No but seriously, welcome to the Saturday night nail-biter that is Beatles week on X Factor. Many thanks to m'colleague Stuart Heritage for the immensely overblown build-up. (Don't cry, he'll be back next week. He's harder to shift than Katie Waissel.) I'm here in his live-blogging bunker for the next two nights, bringing you every twitch of Dannii's facial nerve and every \"bitch please\" look Cheryl Cole gives Louis Walsh. I notice Stu's got a lot of Wagner posters on the walls here. And someone's written Wagner 4 Stu in a dark red substance that I'm sure must be paint. I'm sure there's some innocent explanation. Anyway, join me tonight and I can promise you my relentless fury as the eight remaining acts do their best to murder the two surviving Beatles to actual death. Never the less, here I'll be, live and frantic from 8pm, for what I can only describe as nearly one and a half hours of television. You simply must come. 7.59pm: Could you please take your seats. Extinguish all cigarettes and keep a small dish of cheese to hand for emergency ear-blockage. This shizz just got real. Amateur crooners, shaking the Beatles songbook 'til the pages all fall out on the floor, spontaneously combust and turn to ashes that spell out the word, \"Why?\" Are you ready? I am SO ready. 8.01pm: Please bear in mind that the recap will take us up to around 9pm so you can make a cuppa if you saw last week's. I'm KIDDING. Do not move. There are eight of the mad fools left and it is still anyone's game. (It is One Direction's game, even if they don't win.) It's time. To face. The (technically speaking) music! 8.04pm: Dermot has opted for a waistcoat and looks very dapper. I think he just said, \"It's Beatles tweak!\" That's one way of putting it. Here come the judges. Whose dress is best? Whose dress is best? Cheryl has reinstated the salute. Maybe she just ditched it for Remembrance Week because it would seem sarcastic. 8.05pm: Paul McCartney: \"By the time you see this, I will be far away.\" You said a mouthful, Macca. Very wise move. And first up is Matt Cardle. To hat or not to hat? *edge of seat* 8.07pm: Matt is doing \"sexy\" Beatles. Dannii is seen in rehearsal footage fanning herself and declaring him \"hawt\". We'll see, Dannii. Matt is singing Come Together. He will make this sexy by emphasising the word \"come\". 8.08pm: OK, so Cardle in a vest is not unpleasant. But I am seriously discomfited by his insistence that we, \"come together...... over me.\" I cannot look at Louis during this performance. The more I look at him, the more I now think he just forgot to finish getting dressed. 8.10pm: More screaming over the judges' comments than at Shea Stadium that time. Oh no! Simon agrees with me about the vest. I never agree with Cowell about anything. Next I'll be saying that Katie Waissel is interesting and totally one hundred per cent deserves to be here. I may top myself now. Stu, come back from holiday. 8.12pm: And next after the break, it's One Direction jumping about excitedly, their puppydog eyes peeping out from under their adorable fringes. I really hope they don't try to do \"sexy\" Beatles too. Matt will be sloping off backstage to put on a woolly pully and think about what he's done, exposing his nipples for votes. He's better than that. 8.17pm: And we're back. I think Grace Woodward will have dressed One Direction in Seargent Pepper gear. Now back to the girls. Here comes Cher, who is reportedly doing Imagine. But that's not a Beatles song, Louis will cry. I've not heard it, Simon will reply. Who are The Beatles, Cheryl will add, looking confused. 8.20pm: It's only now I am really seeing Chers \"cold dead eyes of a killer\" expression for what it really is. If you stood in her way she'd rhino-charge you into next week to get to number one. I am afraid of her. They've actually slowed Imagine down EVEN more. Her voice is really reminding me of Nana Mouskouri. This isn't a good thing. I am so bored by this performance I'm thinking of declaring war. 8.20pm: To be fair, Cher, I'd rather just have imagined this performance than actually seen and heard it. 8.23pm: Louis is a brave man to criticise Cher. The rest of the panel are predictably toady. Simon is trying to quash press rumours, and indeed quotes attributed to Louis, that suggest Cher is a right little madame. If I was her mother, I'd ground her from X Factor for a week. No, a fortnight. Everyone agrees Cher is versatile. So she could, say, work in a library. Or a vet's. 8.27pm: Simon says that Beatles week is the perfect opportunity for One Direction. What are they going do? Learn to play instruments and travel back in time? They're doing All You Need Is Love in a strangely slowed-down style that is making my teeth a tad itchy. Can someone speed up the backing track til they're singing falsetto? 8.29pm: Whoever is arranging the songs on this year's show, can we have a quiet word? When you are handed a classic pop song, can you step away from the metronome and just leave it in its original time signature? It sounds like One Direction are singing in time to a steam train. 8.31pm: Judges' verdict: Louis loved it. Dannii draws attention to a problem with the backing vocals. Cheryl is nice to them because otherwise she'd look bad. And Simon is talking about them like they're up for adoption at Battersea Dog's Home. They are not safe. They may be put down if you do not vote for them. Is someone torturing the audience with cattle prods? 8.33pm: Dermot remarked that the audience were going wild and that he couldn't \"hear a thing\". Chance would be a fine thing, Dermo. No but seriously folks, they're playing the actual Beatles in the ad break. This is a terrible terrible idea. The one good thing about two of the Beatles being dead, one of them being in Brazil and the other playing with his train set is that we don't have to compare this lot with the people they're trying to imitate. 8.38pm: Next up is Rebecca with, I'm guessing, a ballad. (I deliberately stopped looking at the leaked song choices after I read that Cher was doing Imagine.) I am not clenching as much this time because she can sort of sing quite well. I damn her with faint praise but I have genuinely seen people in the chorus of a panto in Chelmsford who could out-sing any of these guys. Yesterday! Of course. She will, and I'm going out on a limb here, make this her own. Oh yes. 8.39pm: I've just been informed that Yesterday is the most covered song of all time. I actually had a jewelry box, when I was 10, that played this very tune. And a little ballerina on the top that twirled around. Aah, innocent days. She's not doing badly is she? 8.42pm: Louis rummages around in his cliche bag and pulls out, \"I wanna see you in the final.\" Dannii is on the attack tonight, like she is actually appraising the acts in a genuinely honest way. Simon gives Rebecca the full, \"What I love about you...\" schtick. And Cheryl reassures Rebecca that she is welcome in her dressing room anytime, thus disproving media reports that Cheryl is neglecting Bex in preference to Cher and Waissel. Righto, next up. Mary from Dublin which is in Ireland. Louis is from Ireland. 8.44pm: Mary's been a bit *wavy hand* for the last few weeks. But this week she's got a song that will suit her voice. \"There's something about Mary,\" says Louis and everyone immediately thinks of the Irish matriarch with a suspicious substance in her hair. Back to the music. And she's doing Something in the Way She (He) Moves. Is she trying to do Bassey's Welsh accent? I think she is. 8.46pm: Key change! Of course, key change. How's she doing? That big voice appears to be back and her earrings are wobbling with the sheer force of her sincerity. Is Mary back? 8.49pm: I half expected her to finish Harry Hill-style with \"Way she moves!\" at the end. Dannii is gushing but her eyebrow remains raised. Maybe she's stuck like that til she goes back to Harley Street next week. Simon admits Louis made one right song choice in his entire life. Cheryl says some nonsense about Mary having \"lived\" and Louis is delighted to have his master's approval once more. What Cheryl was really saying is, \"You're all big and old but they've managed to do something with you in hair and make-up that means I can just about look at you without getting distressed. Well done.\" 8.53pm: Dermot says they are \"celebrating\" the songs of The Beatles. You know, I think Paige actually might. I hope he's going jaunty but I fear Dannii will have given him something a bit boring and ultra-slow. 8.55pm: Dannii asks Paige to \"facially\" show her the song. You first, Dannii. *waggles eyebrows* Let it Be for Paige, then. For my money, \"whole package\" considerations aside, Paige has by far the loveliest voice in the competition. I actually relax when he sings. I'm even swaying a little. 8.57pm: He could actually have done without the slowly-clapping choir. And I think that was a SECOND key-change. I dare him to put another key change into his response to the judges. Louis, who will you compare him to this week? A little... 8.57pm: MARVIN GAYE. A little Marvin Gaye! My money was on a Little Little Richard. Booh. *tears up betting slip* 9.00pm: Mary gets patronised for her age and dress size. Paige gets \"I want to cuddle you\" and \"You're so jolly\". I can't imagine any of the judges telling Katie Waissel they want to cuddle her. Throttle her maybe. And now, brace yourselves, insert you emergency cheese and prepare for Wagner. Please please let him come on dressed as Yoko Ono. 9.01pm: Old photos of Wagner as a youth. Never not satisfying. And that is why he will be here until it just becomes sarcastic. 9.02pm: So Wagner got the Sgt Pepper's jacket. Of course. I have a horrible feeling that Get Back will not be the only song he's singing tonight. I am in a ball and crying. OK, the Hippy Hippy Shake - I should've seen that coming. Not actually a Beatles song but a cover they did. I am less offended because of this fact. 9.06pm: Now Hey Jude I am very fond of. I know every note. Sadly, Wagner remains a stranger to every single one. I literally don't know anyone who can't sing the na-nas in Hey Jude. At least I didn't until now. Incredible. That takes actual talent. Dannii refuses to address Wagner's singing. Cheryl lashes out at him for allegedly calling her a \"council estate\" girl and Simon tries to drag things back to the competition. Cheryl appears to be losing the audience's sympathy. The man is untouchable. I would absolutely love Wagner to win so that Cowell is forced to spend millions marketing him for a whole year. I may remortgage my house to fund my phone voting. 9.09pm: They have saved Katie until the end. Say what you like about the ferociously ambitious Stefani-bot, I always watch her performances fully clenched. Gives the old glutes a splendid work-out and I can sip wine at the same time. Super! 9.13pm: Derek Jacobi is advertising Sony. The Beatles are being hung out to dry and the Tories are back in power. Wake me up when it's all over. 9.15pm: Now in such a state of hysteria I thought the big flying X was actually going to hit me in the face. Must concentrate. It's time for controversial Katie. She protests that she doesn't deserve the public opprobrium she is currently drowning in. \"It's not over,\" she insists with eyes that say an earthquake wouldn't shake her now. There's only one song she could be doing. Yes, it's help. And please tell me that's a wig. She looks like Winona Ryder in court. 9.17pm: My musical adviser informs me that this is very much what Lennon's original demo sounded like. A friend has just texted me saying that Katie looks like \"Prince Charles\". Am now helpless with laughter. 9.20pm: Wow. Speaking as a woman with enormous ears, I seriously advise against such a lack of hair around those lobes. Dannii suggests Katie might be better suited to acting. She means she thinks she's a drama queen. Simon, confounding expectation, says he's glad Katie is still in the competition. He claims the performance she gave was \"genius\". I hate it when people say that when they mean \"ingenious\". Simon refuses to wrap up when some brave floor manager is clearly waving his hands around madly. Katie claims she's having a \"wonderful time\". This surprises me. The only woman taking more public flack at the moment is Gillian McKeith. 9.21pm: Voting is open, people. Who will be flushed down the loo of obscurity this week? Here's Our Graham with a quick reminder. 9.26pm: Looking at the recap, Rebecca is exactly the same every week. I think the hair's the same. The eye make-up. Everything. They just put her head on a new dress. I have to admit that Katie was very good but remains utterly charmless. Tomorrow night we can look forward to all of the finalists reuniting to sing David Bowie's Heroes. If you lived through this Beatles extravaganza I declare you tough enough to cope with a Bowie demolition job. If Bowie walks on stage at the end of the song to join them in the final chorus, I will commit actual violence on a nearby soft toy. Right chaps, at ease. We've made it. Thank you buckets for your company this evening. Meet me here tomorrow to witness Katie Waissel totally not going home again and talking about her delight at the news of her son's marriage to Kate Middleton. It's going to be great!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
