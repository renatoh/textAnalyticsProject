It appears the man famed for his fear of flying may have developed a phobia for high-speed trains as well. Given his desperation to play in tonight's vital Champions League fixture, logic suggested Bergkamp would have proposed letting the train take the strain for a journey of just over five hours. Apparently not. \"The train flies,\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said with a smile. \"He prefers to travel by car.\" Having seen Wenger turn down his plan to come here by road, Bergkamp will be twiddling his thumbs at home while his team-mates set about trying to rectify their poor start to this second group stage. \"It's not the best way to prepare, to have 10 hours on the road,\" Wenger said, doubtless with one eye on Sunday's FA Cup tie at home to Chelsea. Not that Bergkamp's arrangements have been occupying all Wenger's thoughts. His willingness to extend his contract beyond next season will hinge on reforms to the transfer system. \"If it comes out that players can move with three months' notice of course I will just leave club football,\" he said. Lyon, and particularly their striker Sonny Anderson, provide a more immediate problem. Defeat this evening would all but end Arsenal's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. With Igor Stepanovs ineligible and Martin Keown injured, Gilles Grimandi is expected to play at centre-half. \"It unfortunate,\" said Wenger. \"Although I am for rotation up front, I try to keep stability at the back.\" Olympique Lyonnais (4-4-2, possible): Coupet; Deflandre, Edmilson, Muller, Delmotte; Malbranque, Violeau, Fo\u00e9, Dhorasoo; Anderson, Marlet. Arsenal (4-4-2, possible): Seaman; Dixon, Adams, Grimandi, Cole; Lauren, Parlour, Vieira, Pires; Henry, Kanu. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
