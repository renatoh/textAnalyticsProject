Last Friday residents began reporting a sudden surge of butterflies, an influx of tens of millions of caper whites in what experts said was a phenomenon that occurred about once a decade. As the butterflies\u2019 numbers began thinning this week, they were set to be replaced by a less majestic spectacle: myriad black flies prompted by a warm spring after a wet winter. The presence of the caper whites was the result of a mass migration from west of the Dividing Range from insects looking to lay eggs. The migration was an annual event but this year took place at a scale seen once every six to 10 years. Residents took to social media remarking on the spectacle, one joking it was \u201csnowing butterflies\u201d, others struggling to capture the flurry of tiny white dots with their cameras. Ross Kendall, a butterfly farmer based in Indooroopilly in Brisbane\u2019s west, told the Courier-Mail the uncommon number of butterflies across the city could be a result of heavier rainfall out west. \u201cIf the season is right out west of the divide they breed up into the millions,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t get a big migration, but I think we are seeing more because of good rain out west.\u201d Christine Lambkin, the entomology curator for Queensland Museum, has said there are no simple explanations for waves of butterflies. But Lambkin said in a 2015 blog that they could relate to hot and humid conditions, which provided \u201cperfect flying weather for butterflies as they don\u2019t need to consume as much energy to keep warm and hydrated\u201d. Brisbane\u2019s peak temperatures at the weekend moved to above 34C, followed by several thunderstorms this week. Parts of Queensland are expected to swelter on Thursday, with some areas predicted to hit top temperatures well above average. The area around Ipswich and Amberley is expected to top out at 38 degrees. Lambkin told the ABC that the weekend weather had also provided perfect weather for twin pests for Brisbane households: house flies (Musca domestica) and bush flies (Musca vetustissima). \u201cThe conditions were perfect last weekend and I think they\u2019ve all broke out of their pupal cases after developing over our damp winter,\u201d she said. \u201cMost insects respond to the time of year \u2014 and when it\u2019s spring, insects decide to become adults.\u201d Lambkin said Australia had an estimated 28,000 species of flies but only a quarter had scientific names to date."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
