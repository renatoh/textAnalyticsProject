With Bacon you have to waste at least a couple of degrees before you reach this level of blue-blooded Hollywood royalty. But Jamie Lee is Hollywood royalty, born of the loins of The Sweet Smell Of Success's Tony and Psycho's Janet, and she got the best genes of both. She has a boyish version of her mother's sculpted beauty, but she also has the comedy chops that helped the old man in Some Like It Hot. Perhaps it was inevitable that Jamie would thrive in the horror genre, especially after Halloween in 1978, which gave her a scream-queen, sex-bomb status that threatened to deform her career. Less inevitably, she shrugged off that straitjacket and proved herself a very able comedienne with her uproarious performance in Trading Places, and later in A Fish Called Wanda. She can also be a considerable straight actress, as she demonstrated in The Tailor Of Panama. Perhaps her best performance was in 1983's Love Letters, as a woman inspired to adultery after discovering letters detailing her own dead mother's affair. Oh, and try the six degrees of Love Letters, in which her own lover was played by James Keach, who played Jesse James in The Long Riders, in which he was shot in the back by traitor Bob Ford, played by one Nicholas Guest, brother of co-star Christopher, husband of Jamie Lee Curtis. That's Jamie-to-Jamie in three moves. Which brings us to Freaky Friday, a likable remake of the 1977 comedy. Jamie gets to play suburban mom to punkette-in-embryo Lindsay Lohan. And then they switch bodies, meaning that bad Jamie comes out to play, subverting her button-down exterior and going hog-wild behind her daughter's guitar and with her own credit card. Jamie wears the wicked ain't-I-a-badass look she must have had on when she and delinquent dad Tony used to chop lines of coke together back in the 1980s. Freaky Friday and Tailor Of Panama have shown us the best of both sides of Jamie Lee within three years, and it makes one wish she worked both more often and more consistently. Career high The mistress of three genres... Comedy: Trading Places and Freaky Friday. Drama: Tailor Of Panama and Love Letters. Horror: Halloween. Career low JLC's made some duffers, but let's go with her verdict. Virus: \"A piece of shit.\" Grandview USA: \"Just bad.\" Need to know Not satisfied with being mere Hollywood royalty, she is now wife to a de facto baron - Christopher Haden-Guest, to give him his full name, is now Baron Haden-Guest. The last word On her decision to expose her shirt contents to the world: \"I thought, while they're up and firm, why not shoot them once or twice?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
