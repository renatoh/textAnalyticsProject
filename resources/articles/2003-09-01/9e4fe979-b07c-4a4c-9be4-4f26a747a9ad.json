Now smiles are the order of the day: Quins have not enjoyed a spell at the top of the table in seven years, since the era of Dick Best and Will Carling. Saturday's sell-out victory against their former tenants and neighbours marked another break with recent tradition: it is also seven years since Quins started the season by winning three out of three. \"It doesn't mean a lot but it's nice,\" said the chief executive Mark Evans. Quins painstakingly built a 12-point advantage, then held out Irish after the visitors' substitute Ed Thrower found a gap to take them within a score in the final 10 minutes. \"It was very fierce around the tackle and ruck,\" said Evans. \"They started like trains, we hung on, they had a good last half-hour, and that was where we won it.\" It was not always pretty but there was heart aplenty, exemplified by the captain Andre Vos, a constant presence despite suffering a chest infection during the week. \"He was fantastic, outstanding; he must have nicked five or six absolutely key balls in our 22,\" said Evans. Thus far, much of the excitement around Quins has centred on the 20-year-old speedster Ugo Monye, who has five tries already. But there is plenty more to the side, which meant Monye could afford an off-day on Saturday. If Monye barely saw the ball, the fly-half Paul Burke was the man to punish Irish, with 60-metre diagonal clearances from hand and a perfect four out of four penalty kicks. He was complemented by the Tongan centre, Josh Taumalolo, who produced a pinpoint drop-goal and a clattering challenge on Mark Cannon. There remains a cloud or two amid the autumn sunshine, however. The citing commissioner will cast more than a casual glance at the hooker Ace Tiatia's apparent shoulder charge on his former team-mate Nick Greenstock on the fringes of a ruck. The incident left the centre, who moved from Quins to Irish over the summer, with a suspected shoulder fracture. Evans's biggest worry involves the lineout, somewhat paradoxically as his jumpers did a perfect job on the Exiles, who were virtually denied any platform from their own throw. However, of Quins' four second-rows, two are unavailable and one of those, Simon Miall, could be out for the rest of the season after a freak accident in the 23rd minute. Miall was carried off after catching his knee on the prop Jon Dawson as he was lifted in the lineout and apparently rupturing the joint. \"It's a weak area for us and it's just got weaker,\" said Evans. The Exiles' main weakness seems to be their finishing. If the forwards were in the hunt, the entire team seemed to suffer the wobbles whenever the Quins' line beckoned. The most glaring example was when the captain Ryan Strudwick surged clear but fell for an old trick, the Quins scrum-half Ben Willis on his shoulder yelling \"mine, mine\". If low cunning is now part of the Harlequin repertoire, the Premiership had better look out.
