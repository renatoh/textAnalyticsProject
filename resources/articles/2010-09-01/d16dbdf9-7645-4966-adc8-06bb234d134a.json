Winning the case is seen as an important factor in helping to convert the \u00a312m loss predicted for this year into break even by 2014, as promised by the Football Association general secretary, Alex Horne, and so reducing the onerous burden on the game's governing body. According to the latest estimate by the Valuation Office Agency, Wembley's rateable value is \u00a310m. Businesses pay their rates at a \"multiplier\" of 41.4p in the pound, meaning Wembley's bill for the current year will come to \u00a34.1m. Under previous estimates, the rate has been set at \u00a310.25m and \u00a38.5m. Insiders are convinced that the rate should be set at around \u00a36m, which would slash the amount the business pays annually by a seven-figure sum. If a tribunal hearing, scheduled to take place before the end of the year, finds in Wembley's favour the compensation is likely to be backdated to when the stadium opened in March 2007. But if the appeal fails, it will close off one of the avenues on which executives were relying to trim the stadium's losses. Lord Coe's 2012 legacy criticised A London Assembly committee will today accuse Olympic organisers of putting \"the interests of elite athletes ahead of local regeneration\" in holding fast to a \"flawed\" plan to convert the main stadium into a 25,000 capacity athletics stadium for two \"wasted\" years. \"The Olympic Board made the wrong decision when opting for an athletics legacy and that decision could have serious consequences for the Olympic Park Legacy Company and for whoeverultimately takes over the stadium,\" says the 80-page report by the Assembly's Economic Development, Culture, Sport and Tourism. It concludes that only a major football or rugby club was ever going to leave a sustainable legacy, implicitly criticising Locog chairman Seb Coe and the former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell who backed the athletics-led plan. The OPLC is examining bids, including tenders from West Ham and O2 operator AEG, to take over the stadium after the games on a \"mixed use\" basis. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger loses tour battle It looks likely that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will be forced to drop his opposition to long haul pre-season tours. In contrast to their rivals, Arsenal under Wenger have always resisted money-spinning and brand-enhancing trips to the far east or the US. But according to those at yesterday's annual shareholder's meeting, Wenger admitted he was under pressure to do so and was more likely to accede to the request in a summer without a major championship \u2013 making 2011 a likely option. The comment was delivered with a rueful smile and a glance in the direction of the club's largest single shareholder, the US sports mogul Stan Kroenke, and chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent much of his pre-Arsenal career in the US. In contrast to some previous years, a relaxed Wenger sidestepped difficult questions with aplomb, reserving his ire for Fifa. He said that despite recommending a minimum of four weeks rest for players in the summer, the governing body was responsible for scheduling the first international friendlies of the new season just a month after the end of the World Cup. Davy Russell's bad day at races Davy Russell must have broken a mirror \u2013 or two \u2013 recently. Arriving at Listowel, the Irish jockey failed a breath test, despite not having had a drink for 15 years. He claimed that using mouthwash had caused him to record a level twice the allowed amount. \"It has to bring into question the whole system of breath-testing jockeys,\" he said. Then after passing a second test, allowed because he arrived at the course early, Russell suffered a nasty fall when his mount Mister Two Fifty fell in the Kevin McManus Beginners Chase. He was taken to hospital suffering injuries to his chest, back and leg \u2013 only to be told that his intended mount in the Devon Inn Hotel Handicap Hurdle, Lough Ferrib, won under substitute rider Davy Condon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
