David Merritt \u2013 whose son Jack was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan \u2013 called the prime minister a fraud following his appearance on Friday night\u2019s TV debate, six days before polling day. Following last Friday\u2019s attack, the Conservatives have pledged to toughen up prison sentences. Merritt believes this would have angered his son, who had \u201cdevoted his energy to the purpose\u201d of prisoner rehabilitation. \u201cJohnson lied and used our son\u2019s death to make political capital,\u201d Merritt said in a thread posted on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cWake up Britain: this man is a fraud. He\u2019s the worst of us, and he\u2019s taking you for a ride. You may think the options open to you in this election are not entirely to your liking. Me neither, but I\u2019ll be voting least worst option: anti-Tory.\u201d During the debate on Friday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, challenged Johnson over remarks Merritt made last week, criticising the use of his son\u2019s death as a pretext to introduce harsher criminal justice reforms. Corbyn said: \u201cI was very moved by what Jack Merritt\u2019s father said about what his son was trying to do. That he wanted a society where you did address the huge problems where somebody committed awful acts like that \u2013 yes of course, you must imprison them, yes of course, you must try and rehabilitate them if you can.\u201d Responding to Corbyn\u2019s challenge, Johnson said he had \u201chuge sympathy for Mr Merritt and the relatives and families of both victims, and it was an absolutely terrible thing\u201d. Johnson added: \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s wrong that some one like Usman Khan, who was sentenced to 21 years \u2026 should have been automatically released on eight years, when the judge, when he was first convicted, made it clear that he was a very serious jihadi.\u201d The attack took place on 29 November just before 2pm in the Fishmongers\u2019 Hall at an event run by Learning Together, a programme focused on prisoner rehabilitation. Khan had been released automatically from prison on licence in December last year after serving eight years for plotting a terror attack on the London Stock Exchange. He had originally been jailed indefinitely in 2012 under an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence. This type of sentence was later scrapped by the Tories and Khan was sentenced to 16 years following a successful appeal in 2013. Khan was automatically released midway through this sentence under now-scrapped sentencing laws. The parole board did not assess Khan prior to his release, despite the requests of a judge. On Saturday morning, Merritt said that Corbyn \u201cspoke the truth last night\u201d, adding that the facts of attack \u2013 including Khan\u2019s motivation and what could have been done differently \u2013 will not be known until an inquest is complete. He called for an inquiry, rather than a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, to examine what could be done to prevent future attacks and accused the Conservatives of \u201ctrying to look tough on the backs of other prisoners\u2019 suffering\u201d. The row came as the Conservatives placed reducing immigration at the heart of their last-minute pitch to voters, pledging to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d of EU nationals, reduce numbers overall and trigger a big reduction in low-skilled migrants. Key to the new Tory system will be ensuring all migrants have a \u201cdigital immigration status\u201d after 2022. It will be used to crack down on illegal overstaying, though the party insists it will help legal migrants prove their status. The new system would divide people into three categories \u2013 exceptional talent, skilled workers and \u201csector-specific\u201d \u2013 the latter made up of categories that will change based on advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC). It will screen all prospective migrants for previous criminality and bar those with serious convictions. In a letter to voters, Johnson described the election as one of the most important in more than a century. \u201cIn 1906, the Liberal government won a majority and the balance of power crucially tipped towards democracy,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn 1945, the Conservative party had lost its way and the Attlee government created the NHS \u2013 one of the great achievements in British politics in the 20th century. And in 1979 the Thatcher government dragged Britain out of the nightmare of the 1970s. \u201cNow, in 2019 we face another of these historic elections. Like 1906, 1945 and 1979 the impact of this election will be felt for decades to come. But unlike those elections, in 2019 it is not a single party that has lost its way, but the entire parliament.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
