He is a prototypical young Australian male, tanned, muscled, with a propensity for drink over talk, and leaves behind his weeping, pregnant lover with the words: \u201cI just want to get fucked up.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s been to a height-of-summer house party in Australia during their 20s will recognise where he ends up. There is a DJ, dancing, copious drugs being passed around, the sun is shining, and there\u2019s a pool with plenty of people in it. There are a few unsettling strands of difference. In one corner, a group play a lethal game of Russian roulette. In another, an orgy is in full swing. Whatever you do, don\u2019t kill our buzz. Hilditch\u2019s film seems to illustrate the remarkable skill Australians have for hedonism and pleasure-seeking, even in the face of a meteorite careening straight for Earth. And it\u2019s not so hard to make the mental leap from meteorite to irreversible climate change. What about those other shadows that creep at the edges of our happy, sun-soaked lives? The tales of men that sew up their lips and women who drink bottles of shampoo? As temperates slowly edge up around the country, a whiff of suntan lotion catches the air. In the mornings we will undress, rather than dress, so that we can slip into the foamy ocean for a swim. We\u2019ll sit at outdoor cafes to sip on caramel-coloured lattes, and on our tables will lie newspapers with headlines screeching of terrible wars overseas and asylum seekers on boats. But they will all feel so far away from our endless summer days. In Last Resort 2, Sydney artist Alex Seton has carved marble into the shape of two inflatable palm trees. The likeness is uncanny \u2013 you will have a mad urge to squeeze them. The trees are peppy and tacky, like cheap sunglasses or a $10 umbrella cocktail. Seton has placed them on an island of rubble \u2013 Australia, the island continent, paradise island \u2013 where the \u201cgood life\u201d is abundant. But the cold ponderous marble rejects your dismissal. This is not throwaway plastic. It is ancient stuff, memorial rock, but memorialising who? And then that pile of rubble \u2013 not sand, soft and welcoming, but uncompromising like the concrete floor of a prison. We are not talking about the Australia of our dreams, here, but a displaced Australia, an island in the middle of nowhere, a place that calls itself a detention centre, but has all the qualities of something much crueler. The work belongs to a series that 37-year-old Seton has collected under the title Refoulement, showing at Sullivan + Strumpf in Sydney before touring to Canberra and Melbourne. The term \u201cnon-refoulement\u201d refers to a legal principle to which many countries are bound, protecting asylum seekers and refugees from being sent back to a place of persecution. It is an obligation, a duty of care, that is not discretionary. In layman\u2019s terms, there\u2019s no negotiating on this one. And yet, in the eyes of the Australian government and large swathes of the public, it has become a topic of heated political debate. As Seton tells me in his Newtown studio: \u201cThis is a defining question asked of our generation. I\u2019m interested, as an artist, in who we say we are versus what we do, and how those things align.\u201d Seton says he was inspired by \u201cthe different discussions you have with friends and family, even strangers around dinner tables at the pub. You\u2019ll be discussing the issue of asylum seekers and no matter where the debate went, one line that kept reiterating itself to me was \u2018someone died trying to have a life like mine\u2019.\u201d The resulting work premiered at the Adelaide biennial. Someone died trying to have a life like mine features 28 lifejackets carved out of marble, marking the lives of asylum seekers lost at sea. Seton says the work \u201cchallenges [the viewer] to empathise with those souls, and then by inference asks the question: what is it about our privileged status that would make them want to come here at all?\u201d That the asylum seeker issue is a debate at all, used to score political points, is its own problem. Seton\u2019s work intentionally avoids politicisation, instead shifting the spotlight to the current reconfiguration of Australia\u2019s nation identity. \u201cQuestions of how we treat others are inherent to our sense of self, our morality. The values at the heart of this can define us, and what kind of nation we want to become.\u201d Seton believes that Australia\u2019s \u201cgenerosity of spirit is being frayed by these closed border policies\u201d. And will the work stand as a record of Australia\u2019s human rights crimes? \u201cIt will certainly stand as a record for this moment in time, and the crisis \u2013 particularly the moral crisis \u2013 which we\u2019re now undergoing on the issue.\u201d \u2022 Refoulement is showing at Sullivan + Strumpf until 11 October; McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery, 16 November - 8 February 2015, and Linden Centre for Contemporary Art, 19 December - 15 February 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
