In a surprise switch, Heffernan replaces Mick Kinane, who instead rides Admiralofthefleet in a four-strong Ballydoyle bid to topple Authorized in the Sandown feature. \"It certainly came as a surprise to find I was on George Washington,\" said Heffernan yesterday. \"But I am delighted, because I think he's the best horse in the race. Authorized was a good Derby winner, but my fellow's a year older.\" Heffernan has yet to partner George Washington in public, but knows the colt well from working him on the Ballydoyle gallops. \"I've ridden him plenty of times and I don't think the mile and a quarter at Sandown will be any problem,\" said the jockey. \"He was going on well at the finish behind Ramonti at Royal Ascot.\" George Washington, who earlier this week had been considered a doubtful runner owing to the prevailing soft ground, is 4-1 second favourite with Coral behind the 2-1 on Authorized. The sponsors yesterday cut Admiralofthefleet to 14-1 after the riding arrangements became public. \"When it comes to major races, Mick Kinane is one of the most popular riders with punters and I fully expect Admiralofthefleet to go off a single figure price on Saturday,\" said Coral spokesman Simon Clare. \"We have laid 33s, 25s and 16s, and he is our worst result.\" It might be dangerous to read too much into the jockey bookings, though. After the Irish Derby, Heffernan came in for glowing praise from O'Brien, who said: \"As a jockey he's getting better year by year. He's maturing all the time and is a world-class jockey.\" Admiralofthefleet had been Heffernan's ride in the Derby, where the colt weakened in the last two furlongs to finish 10th. \"He didn't get the trip at Epsom,\" said Heffernan yesterday. \"But I am happy to be with George Washington. He's fine and has been cantering away nicely.\" Yellowstone and Archipenko make up Ballydoyle's Eclipse challenge. Frankie Dettori, the rider of Authorized, was handed a 14-day ban by the disciplinary panel of the Horseracing Regulatory Authority yesterday for his excessive use of the whip on Ramonti at Royal Ascot. The suspension begins next Friday, ruling Dettori out of the July Cup at Newmarket, but ends in time for the Italian to be reunited with Authorized in the King George at Ascot. Ron Cox's tip of the day One Hour 4.25 Sandown A colt by the dual Eclipse winner Halling, One Hour has one Sandown course win to his name and he looks set to double up here. In these days of punitive weights-rises, One Hour seems fortunate to have escaped with just a 4lb rise for his all-the-way win over nine furlongs. Trainer Marcus Tregoning has a high regard for One Hour, who should be capable of further improvement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
