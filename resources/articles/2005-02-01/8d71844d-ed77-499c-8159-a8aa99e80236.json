This is not a subjective judgment but a statement of fact. Last Saturday afternoon, a crowd gathered in the main square of the Breton town of Bourbriac, beside the imposing 11th-century church, and set fire to a pile of local estate agents' brochures. \"Brittany not for sale!\" was their uncompromising message. Britons buying homes in the area were one of the targets for the demonstration - or, as the French more poetically prefer, \"manifestation\". It followed recent instances of \"Brits out\" graffiti being daubed on estate agents and the office of the local notary. The sleepy town of Bourbriac (pop: 2,300) has become the focus of Breton nationalism; it has even been dubbed the \"village of hate\" by the touchier sections of the British press. Not quite Fallujah perhaps, but close. I decide against a flak jacket. I am going to Bourbriac in the spirit of friendship, amity, the entente cordiale. Admittedly, I know only a few words the locals will understand - croissant, pain au chocolat, croque monsieur, Agincourt, Nelson, Sebastian Coe - but I am taking some symbolic gifts purchased at the Waterloo Eurostar terminal and contained in a large plastic bag emblazoned with a union flag. I will be an ambassador for Britain; a one-man peace initiative. From Paris, it is a three-hour train journey to Guingamp, close to the northern coast of Brittany, then a 10km taxi ride to Bourbriac. Snow is falling when I arrive and the village of hate is quiet. My union flag bag attracts little attention from passers-by, but in Le Ty Breizh, a busy bar in the square, there is an audible intake of breath as I enter. At least it would be audible if a Santana CD wasn't playing so loudly. The bar owner, Ronan, is friendly but suspicious. \"I am a man of business,\" he says. \"I have to try to keep all sides satisfied.\" He introduces me to Gilles, a local man who speaks good English. Gilles has two jobs - catering and undertaking (\"In the summer we are very busy - we do weddings in the morning and funerals in the afternoon\"). Gilles says he is doing neither today and offers his services as a translator. The bar is filled with elderly men in flat caps. Gilles asks four of them if they would be willing to be interviewed - the negotiations take about an hour and involve many hand shakes. One makes his excuses and leaves, but the other three eventually submit. It is 11.30am but they are already drinking red wine; in the spirit of fraternity, we buy another bottle. \"Many of the houses bought by the British are falling down,\" says Lucien. \"They are ruins. No one lives in them, so what is the problem if the British buy them? In a way, it is a good thing.\" \"The small villages around Bourbriac are being born again,\" adds Joseph. Eugene's take on the issue I can't quite work out: It may be his age, his high-pitched voice, or the red wine, but he seems to express both sides of the subject at once. It may not be hate, but nor is it quite affection. All three complain about the language barrier. Few of the British can speak French, let alone Breton. Incomers prefer the \"English-spoken\" restaurant on the other side of the square. \"Most of the Brits moving in are in their 50s,\" says Lucien, \"too old to learn a new language. As we are to learn English.\" The men in the bar claim that the manifestation was not organised by people in Bourbriac, but by a pressure group based near the north coast who want the government to buy up old houses, renovate them and rent them at low prices to locals. \"I don't understand why they come here to demonstrate,\" says Lucien. \"There are even more English people in other parts of Brittany. Why pick Bourbriac?\" Lucien is lucid; Eugene remains elusive. So Lucien gets the goodwill gift - a union flag mug. I place it on the table in front of him; he ignores it proudly. \" Au revoir ,\" I say, trying to integrate. \"No, you must say kenavo - goodbye in Breton,\" says Gilles. The woman in the local estate agents makes a few quickfire points. The statistic, widely quoted, that a quarter of the people in Bourbriac are British is absurdly overstated, she says. The organisers of the demonstration spent six weeks advertising it, yet attracted no more than 60 people. Most were from outside Bourbriac. Those opposed to incomers are a \"tiny minority\". The river of hate is more a tributary of tetchiness. But don't quote me, she says, because you never know. Francois Diridollou has run the charcuterie in the square for almost 30 years; his parents ran it before him. He is a dapper, self-confident man, and in between cutting slices of steak he makes it clear that he is worried by the influx of Brits - and, perhaps worse, Parisians. \"I wasn't surprised by the demonstration,\" he says. \"Property prices have been rising very fast - 30% in the past four years. That's not just the fault of the British, but they are one of the reasons. People like to sell their property to the British because they will get a good price. But I can understand why the British want to live here, and there are good things about their arrival as well as bad.\" One of the good things may be a boom in sales of his sausages. I give him a model of a Beefeater as a memento. Back at Le Ty brizh, the present-giving is getting out of hand. I give Ronan a large postcard with a map of Great Britain; he gives me a Breton T-shirt. This may be a peace offering, too, because despite his attempts at even-handedness, he keeps talking about the cultural divide between the \"Latin\" and the \"Anglo-Saxon\" nations. Since the T-shirt is about 14 sizes too small for me, the olive branch proves brittle. There is a large man in the bar with a baseball cap and handlebar moustache. The handlebar moustache is appropriate because he is a retired Harley-Davidson dealer called John Davey. Better still he is British and in the process of buying a house in the area (\u00a340,000, in need of a little updating - roof, bathroom, etc) with a local government officer called Lynne Spedding. Davey is from Yorkshire and a character. He witnessed Saturday's manifestation and calls it a \"circus\". No local people, a bunch of Breton nationalists seeking media attention for their cause, and a Brit dressed as a chicken staging a counter demonstration. \"Was the demo an aberration?\" I ask him. \"That's a posh way of saying bullshit,\" he says, before buffing himself another lager. \"I've seen more anger at Mothercare.\" \"The people here are wonderful,\" says Spedding. \"Anywhere you go you're welcomed, especially if you try to speak some French.\" Spedding is learning French; Davey is attempting Breton. \"Then we can swear in three languages,\" he explains. Davey insists we meet a friend of his, Jon White, a 61-year-old architect from Cornwall, who moved to the nearby village of St Adrien two years ago with his wife, Deane. \"We're very pleased we moved, and wouldn't go back,\" he says. \"There's a bit of animosity towards people with holiday homes, but that's no different to what you get in Cornwall or Wales. They like Parisians with second homes even less than they like us Brits. The protestors complain that incomers are pricing young people out of the market, but Bretons aren't interested in buying the sort of places that most English people buy anyway.\" It is clear that the situation in Bourbriac is more complex than many people would credit. But the photographer and I did not make the journey just to catalogue feeling, we came to heal. We decide to embark on a spot of le shuttle diplomacy, and arrange a meeting with the mayor, at a couple of hours' notice (would that be possible in the UK?). Yannick Botrel is earnest, bespectacled and probably bored with answering questions about the \"village of hate\". He has only just got rid of a French TV crew, here in pursuit of the manifestation. \"The problem started with the graffiti,\" says the mayor.\" We don't know who did it, but its effect was to attract the press to Bourbriac. Media coverage then attracted Breton nationalist groups. There have been demonstrations against rising property prices in several parts of Brittany in the past month, but they chose to have the final one here because the media now knows Bourbriac. There are only 35 British properties in the town, and five properties owned by other EU nationals. The number of incomers has been greatly exaggerated. C'est fou !\" Gilles doesn't need to translate the last bit. The mayor, who is a socialist, dismisses the \"village of hate\" tag. \"In Brittany we don't have any trouble with xenophobia. It's not like in the south of France, for example. This is not Marseille. The far right polls very badly in Brittany. We have a tradition of openness and tolerance. This talk of the village of hate is nonsense.\" A little tearfully, I give him a flag of St George to go with the huge Breton flag behind his desk. A moment of touching symbolism. It is apparent that, if any healing is to be acheived, we must meet with the manifesters. So, early the next morning, in a snow-covered car park in the nearby town of Louargat, we meet two representatives of A-Stroll. Guillaume Bricaud, the organisation's \"speaker\" (not leader, he emphasises) is tall and rangy; he wears a Palestinian scarf and smokes roll-ups. He is unemployed. His colleague, Jon Mai Salomon, is older, shorter, grey-haired; he teaches Breton and French. The interview is conducted in a freezing bus shelter. \"A-Stroll is a leftwing group dedicated to promoting Breton culture,\" says Bricaud. \"We are also fighting for every Breton to have a place to live. We are not xenophobes - we are an anti-fascist organisation - and our action is not directed only at the British. Proletarian people from Britain are welcome here. But property speculators are not welcome - high property prices make it difficult for poor Bretons to find a home. When we see a ruin with a 'Sold' sign, and we find it has been bought for 60,000 euros, even before it has been renovated, we ask ourselves what chance local people have.\" Bricaud says there will be further demonstrations in other places and, if the government fails to ban second homes and compulsorily purchase properties in need of renovation, protests may become more violent, perhaps leading to the sort of attacks on second homes once common in Wales. He stresses that A-Stroll would not carry out such attacks (\"We may not respect the law, but we do respect people\"), but fears other militant groups will be less considerate. \"We are not anti-British ourselves,\" says Salomon, \"but anti-British feeling is growing in Brittany and we are tapping into that. Unless something is done, the British will be targets. In small villages, the British come and almost take the village over. The local people feel overwhelmed.\" They argue that the British need to integrate more, learn French (they accept that learning Breton may be too difficult) and make an effort to appreciate the local culture. Then they will be welcome - but no second homes and no internet property sites selling directly to British buyers at a 30% premium. \"We want Brittany to be a place where people live all year, not for three months of the year,\" says Bricaud. In winter snow as well as summer sun. Bricaud hands me a statement from A-Stroll (\"Des logments tour les Bretons, pas pour les colons!\") and gives me the poster they used to advertise the demonstration. In return, I give him a large postcard showing the changing of the guard and a gift pack with three teas, including English breakfast and Earl Grey. Salomon gets a notebook with a plastic union flag cover and a postcard of a Routemaster bus. We shake hands and say our farewells. My feet are so cold I forget to say kenavo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
