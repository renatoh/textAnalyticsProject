It\u2019s not for kids \u2013 it falls into that dreaded category, adult panto \u2013 and its masked audience are further insulated from one another by Perspex screens. Is it possible, in such circumstances, to enjoy oneself? Reader, it is. Lizzy Connolly\u2019s production is proof against the unpropitious circumstances, whipping through this glass slipper (well, crystal Ugg boot) tale with good bad jokes, tight performances and lashes of self-irony. Scripted by Jodie Prenger and Neil Hurst, this Christmas confection doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything it\u2019s not. It\u2019s Cinderella with rude jokes, shorn of characters (due to Boris\u2019s rule of six) and \u2013 like the Prince\u2019s ball, which is subject to Covid curfew \u2013 over almost before it\u2019s begun. The storytelling is efficient bordering on clinical. Give or take a \u201clook behind you\u201d detour mocking the Cats movie, there\u2019s little of the padding that can make family pantos feel like overstuffed stockings. It features strong work from Rufus Hound as Buttons, who demands a \u201cFuck the Tories!\u201d from the crowd at his every entrance. (In this well-heeled corner of Wandsworth, he does well to get one.) As Cinders\u2019 sisters, Oscar Conlon-Morrey and Scott Paige make an emphatically obnoxious twosome, mocking one another\u2019s (and everyone else\u2019s) shape, looks and promiscuity with what feels, in this day and age, like startling impropriety. \u201cHaving sex with you,\u201d to offer one among many examples, \u201cis like doing push-ups over a manhole.\u201d It could all get pretty tawdry, if these weren\u2019t high-end performers, delivering the relentless single and double entendres with skills honed on Shaftesbury Avenue, a queer cabaret edge \u2013 and a cheerful sense of the ridiculousness of the enterprise. There\u2019s topical tomfoolery alongside the old school sleaze, too, as Hound circles the stage with a two-metre stick, measuring out a safe distance between Daisy Wood-Davis\u2019s Cinders and her royal squeeze. The magic of Christmas is in short supply, but there\u2019s throwaway fun to be had here in a show that radiates delight at being back in a theatre \u2013 Perspex screens notwithstanding. At Turbine theatre, London, until 23 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
