The president is desperate for their approval but the only thing his efforts buy him is a note taped to his back that says \u201cImpeach Me\u201d. The sketch wraps up with a half-clever dig at Melania Trump\u2019s hypocritical anti-bullying initiative and a groan-worthy Peloton reference, the first of two for the night. It\u2019s hard to see what the writers are going for. When the real-life leaders mocked Trump they had every reason for doing so, but here they\u2019re portrayed as bratty high school bullies and Trump is the sympathetic one. The show seems to want to twist the knife in Trump\u2019s wounded ego but it ends up bolstering his anti-Nato stance by presenting its members as smarmy elitist punks. It\u2019s not the worst cold open of the season, but it may be the most misguided. Jennifer Lopez hosts for a third time. Dressed in a tuxedo, she celebrates her \u201cunbelievable year\u201d \u2013 which saw her star in the biggest movie of her career, sell out a concert tour, land next year\u2019s Super Bowl half-time show, get engaged to a former Yankee and turn 50 \u2013 by leading the Rockettes in a rendition of Santa Claus is Coming to Town. She concludes by shedding her tux to reveal the iconic green Versace dress she wore to the 2000 Grammys. Not to begrudge Lopez her success, but the whole thing comes off as a bit too self-congratulatory. She and the writers might have at least tried to add some jokes to the mix other than the single one about how even at 50 she\u2019s still hot enough make men\u2019s heads explode. In the first sketch, a married couple (Lopez and Mikey Day) win a surprise home makeover, but their disparate levels of attractiveness \u2013 she\u2019s a \u201cbronze goddess\u201d, he\u2019s \u201can unemployed Smurf man\u201d with an average package \u2013 cause the host to have a stroke. Its five minutes of the same joke, over and over again. Much the same can be said of Chad &amp; J-Lo, in which Lopez meets and falls for Pete Davidson\u2019s slacker chick-magnet, much to chagrin of her fiance, Alex Rodriguez. If you\u2019ve seen one Chad sketch you have seen them all. The Corporal is a black-and-white drama about two sisters (Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon) competing for the affection of a rich suitor. Their attempts to sabotage each other are thwarted by the intrusion of a gorgeous third sister, who they have kept hidden all their lives. There\u2019s some enjoyably cartoonish slapstick and a solid final punchline but it\u2019s yet another piece revolving almost entirely around how attractive Lopez is. That wasn\u2019t a strong enough hook to carry one sketch, let alone three in a row plus the monologue. DaBaby is the night\u2019s musical guest. Joined by masked dance crew the Jabbawockeez, he performs Bop. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost covers House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s claim, upon being asked if she hates Trump, that her Catholic faith prevents her from hating anyone. A Catholic himself, Jost declares: \u201cThe Catholic approach wouldn\u2019t be to impeach Trump, it would be to quietly transfer him to a different presidency.\u201d Pelosi (Kate McKinnon) joins him to speak for herself, defending her decision to move along with impeachment proceedings by noting: \u201cIt\u2019s not the lifeguard\u2019s fault for evacuating the pool, it\u2019s the rich kid who took a dook in the deep end.\u201d After the second news rundown, in which Michael Che\u2019s joke about Post Malone being the most streamed musical artist of 2019 \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s replacing last year\u2019s winner, Pre Malone\u201d \u2013 recalls the classic Norm McDonald bit about \u201cBetter than Ezra\u201d, the hosts welcome Jules, Who Sees Things a Little Differently (Beck Bennett) to give his take on the holidays. Fresh off a \u201ccocaine misunderstanding\u201d, the pretentious trust-fund kid describes his perfect holiday meal: \u201cA table with one person of every ethnicity \u2013 white, gay, wheelchair \u2013 all seated together, eating nothing but conversation.\u201d After an awkward Christmas sketch in which hip-hop carolers perform some unfunny rap carols about Home Alone to a white family who they then rob with the help of DaBaby, we get a commercial for Hoops, a jewelry store that specializes in selling \u201cearrings that say I fight other women\u201d. \u201cOne hundred per cent metal\u201d, Hoops are good for every occasion, including birthday dinners, ex-boyfriend\u2019s weddings, women-on-the-street interviews about subway problems, confronting/accusing/crawling back to Barbara and, of course, Sunday mass. One thing SNL remains good at is poking loving fun at east coast trashiness, and although this isn\u2019t one of their more memorable examples, it is the funniest sketch of the night. An informercial for Potty PM offers a detachable hose that connects directly from privates to toilet. The pitchman (Kyle Mooney) claims it\u2019s perfect for anyone who hates having to get up in the middle of the night, but when asked \u201cHow does it work for women?\u201d he can\u2019t provide an answer. Mooney\u2019s embarrassed pronunciation of \u201cclitoris\u201d earns a chuckle but it\u2019s yet another sketch that drags out way too long. It\u2019s still better than the following sketch, about a couple of yuppies window shopping in a bizarre Wisconsin hardware store. Credit to the writers and cast for trying to get weird but it just doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t remember the last time the studio audience was this dead. DaBaby returns and performs Suge, then Barry\u2019s Bootcamp \u2013 a muggy, less funny retread of a SoulCycle sketch from earlier this year \u2013 closes out the night. This is the most forgettable episode of the season, neither J-Lo\u2019s star power nor the big-name guests elevating the one-note sketches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
