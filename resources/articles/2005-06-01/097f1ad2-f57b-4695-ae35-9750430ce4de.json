Gowers was scathing about Neil's claim that the FT's reputation for accuracy is slipping, criticising his decision to attack the pink 'un in his Evening Standard column last year. Neil had listed three front-page FT stories that he claimed were inaccurate. 'Every single one of them has been proved right', Gowers said last week. 'I would have [written to him] if I felt his views on the media had any relevance, but of course he's no longer a media commentator and that's just as well.' Neil's response is typically ebullient: 'I don't regard myself as a friend or enemy of Gowers and there is much about his paper I admire (and read every day) ... but his cavalier attitude to what I wrote only shows how careless with the facts he is.' But does Neil's analysis stand up to scrutiny? The first FT story he cited was a report that Vodafone had 'edged ahead' in the bid battle for US rival AT&amp;T Wireless. 'It was wrong before the paper hit the news stands,' Neil argues, 'since an American mobile operator Cingular, had already snatched AT&amp;T during the night. So I'm not sure how Gowers can claim he got that one right.' The second, Neil says, claimed that 'Scottish &amp; Newcastle is set to sever its industrial roots by ending a 255-year brewing tradition in Scotland and Newcastle.' Neil says: 'S&amp;N did plan to close its famous Fountain brewery in the Scottish capital ... but it has - and still has - other brewing facilities in the City and elsewhere in Scotland. So it was hardly \"severing\" its Scottish roots. I don't see how Gowers can claim he got that right either.' He concedes that Gowers is 'on slightly stronger ground' on the third story, which reported that Malcolm Glazer was about to make a bid for Manchester United. 'The bid did come ... 15 months later! I repeat: taken together, Gowers' remarks about all the stories being true only underlines how cavalier he is with the facts ... maybe that explains why his paper has developed the same characteristic'. Over to you, Mr Gowers. Downloads on the up in Radio Pod Even the most enthusiastic technophile could not approve of the name, but 'podcasting' could yet become big business. Downloading radio programmes from the internet is booming, fuelled by growing MP3 player sales, and primarily the ubiquitous i-pod. Apple CEO Steve Jobs, right, described it last week as the 'hottest thing going on in radio' and if the BBC's latest figures are anything to go by, he may be right. It has made 20 programmes available on its website as part of a trial. More than 300,000 people have downloaded content in the past two months and Radio 4's In Our Time has been downloaded 20,000 times a week. Simon Nelson, controller of BBC radio and music interactive, says: 'It's surpassed all our expectations. The future for downloading is extremely bright. This is the way people expect to get radio in the future.' Virgin Radio became the UK's first and only commercial station to enter the market in March, when it launched a 40-minute podcast of the Pete and Geoff show. A spokesman says its website has seen more than 1,500 downloads a day. The experiment was bankrolled by 'podvertisements', but there is a major drawback; copyright issues mean its podcasts have to be stripped of news, weather and music. Old-fashioned radio is likely to be around for a while yet. Strewth: get the brown strides out It's time for News International executives and editors to get the brown trousers out again - the boss is back in town. Rupert Murdoch flies in to London this week, officially to read the lesson at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street at the service to mark Reuters' farewell to the Street of Shame; unofficially, NI's finest fear that he will be reading the riot act to some of their number in Wapping. Many expect him to deliver his real message at a post-St Bride's party to which all have been invited. Where will his gaze fall first? Rupert has a lot of things on his mind. He is splashing out \u00a3600 million on new presses over the next few years - a commendable investment in the future of print, but he is a man known to want to squeeze every penny from his capex, sometimes even before he has invested it. As usual, there will be particular concern at the offices of NI's perennial cash-guzzler, the Times, which was the main force behind recent big losses. But the all-important sales figures are going the right way for the new compact, so maybe editor Robert Thompson can enjoy the meeting for once. But there is a distinct whiff of fear about the Sun these days. A slow but steady loss of readers, the Daily Mail creeping inexorably closer and ... nothing tangible - just a general feeling that things are not quite right under Rebekah Wade's editorship. There is a distinct nostalgia for the sure-footed confidence of the Kelvin McKenzie days that bodes ill for the Old Currant Bun. Or perhaps Murdoch will go straight for the top. Chief executive Les Hinton (once again overlooked in the Honours List) has apparently been awfully preoccupied of late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
