At the 2008 games in Beijing we will therefore be fielding a GB team made up of wannabe-Jordans (and that's not Michael) as well as some footballers who can't actually play any football but know how to score. None of them will be able to spell the word 'tongue', either, but oddly all of them will know exactly what to do with one. I am alternately entertained and horrified by the gobby, barely literate, endlessly whingeing collection of hormones that make-up the That'll Teach 'Em experiment. Hugely entertained mostly because I recognise my 16-year-old self in every stroppy, swaggering, selfdramatising, backchatting minx who crumples in a sobbing heap clutching her teddy the minute she gets a letter from home - and horrified by their ignorance. Last week, we watched them failing to identify Scotland and London on a map of the British Isles - but it's not always their fault they're so dim; sometimes they've just been taught that way. At Hope Green school, all eyes and cameras are on cute-as-a-button blonde Stevie, the aspirant model. 'She wants a boob job,' laughs her mother in much the same indulgent tone that might once have been used to say 'she wants a Cabbage Patch Doll'. Despite this and needing three tries at the blackboard in order to spell 'remember' ('The English at my school is much more funner than the English here because I think it's much more harder here and I thought I was really good at it when I was at my other school but now I'm here I think I'm going to do really bad...'), Stevie has been made head girl. The boys, on the other hand, are rather sweet, notably head boy, Perry, currently in dizzy thrall to his opposite number's charms. They may swear too much or, as the amusing 'Scoutmaster' Mr Vince observed, deploy 'a ridiculous south London patois', but the boys are also enthusiastically embracing a more hands-on approach to learning, deftly changing car wheels and milking goats. The girls, meanwhile, are jealous of the boys for 'having fun', but also fail to consider practical skills such as typing, cooking and sewing as anything other than demeaning. 'We've learnt never to clean again,' muttered one, sulkily, at the end of her domestic studies class - silly girl: how does she think Kim and Aggie got to have a hit TV show and lucrative reinvented careers? In a week when the media has been bursting with reports of boys underachieving in their GCSEs, it's impossible not to watch That'll Teach 'Em and see the obvious benefits of a bit of woodwork and car maintenance. Teenage boys like doing stuff, if they're given stuff to do, and, occasionally, when they're not busy obsessing over Justin Timberlake, some girls quite like doing stuff as well - as long as they can do it as well as, or, ideally, even better, than the boys. More evidence of this came during the BBC's delightful new plant-porn series, A Year at Kew, in which narrator Alan Titchmarsh revealed that when he was a student at the School of Horticulture 'everyone wanted to get a placement on the tree gang', more formally known as the Arboricultural Unit, with 14,000 charges. The Tree Gang get to climb and occasionally wield chainsaws and it does look like great fun. The head of tree-felling is a charming man named John, who admitted that 'getting a job here is like carrying on my childhood'. Big and butch but entirely in touch with his feminine side, John was clearly the newest of New Men, shedding a tear after felling one large sick specimen (make that 13,999 trees, then) and observing that 'a lot of people come and hug the trees... they say you can hear the sap rising. Actually I'm a bit of a tree-hugger myself.' Elsewhere inside Kew's awesomely lovely 300 acres, Emma Fox, the youngestever keeper of the Palm House, looked just like Sigourney Weaver in Alien as she aimed a modified leafblower loaded with fungal spores at her 'babies', while the team charged with building a human-sized badger's sett for the Go Wild festival struggled with their digging deadline. Perhaps they should have employed some badgers? I was at Kew - one of my favourite places on earth ever since the days when it cost one old penny to get in - for a whole Saturday recently, and the only way I could persuade my son to get out of the giant badger sett (very Narnia) was by telling him that we were going to 'climb' a giant redwood in the Treetop Walk. It was hard to say which of us was enjoying all of this the most, but by lunch time we had both fallen asleep in the shade of the willow, halfway through what turned out to be a magical day. The BBC crew was at Kew that day, too, which, by my reckoning, means (hooray) there's already a second series of filming under way. I won't miss it. I'm not sure how clever it is to start a new seven-part drama in the middle of August, but Channel 4 has seen fit to do it with the pacy modern transatlantic love story, NY-LON, which, after just one episode, I don't want to be missing either. Plot? Boy meets girl in London, boy loses girl, girl finds dead body, boy flies to find girl in New York, boy flies home without girl and, next week, boy's casual girlfriend announces she's pregnant. Whatever, just sit back and enjoy. Beneath NY-LON's veneer of modish but potentially irritating gimmickry (split screens and ticking timecodes, flashbacks and forwards, \u00e0 la 24) there lurks a traditionalist heart - sharp writing, smart editing and some lovely shotmaking - which should mean that the series' fanbase stretches all the way from the sort of teenagers who can't locate the US on a globe, much less Manhattan, to those members of the Titchmarsh treehugging generation who enjoy a drama that isn't afraid to wear its brain as well as its heart on its sleeve. Meanwhile, the two scrumptious leads - Stephen Moyer (persuasively vile in the gang-rape drama Men Only) and Rashida Jones (beguiling daughter of Quincy) - are, aside from BBC news anchor Fiona Bruce and weatherman Alex Deakin, the most attractive couple you'll find on the box at 10pm on this or probably any other Tuesday. BBC2's highly compulsive international posh-property series Superhomes signed off last week and it was a jawdropper. The upscale property market in Moscow may be in its infancy but demand currently far outstrips supply. For the New Russians a multimillion-dollar cash deal (there are no mortgages) on their house is just part of a lifestyle that includes posses of bodyguards whispering into their cuffs and a kalashnikov on the gilded occasional table. Just 10 years ago Vladimir Bryntsalov was the manager of a small state-owned factory, and is now a pharmaceuticals billionaire whose main family home (he has several) is disguised to look like a science lab inside his factory compound. You couldn't have made it up, unless you were Ian Fleming. Bryntsalov generously invited the BBC inside his insanely ugly home, with rooms leading off a full-size indoor tennis-cum-basketball court, showed us his closet (a $25,000 alpaca coat) and introduced us to his young son, Alex, who explained that dad has taught him to 'earn money, keep money and spend money'. But it was Mr B's vulgar and ostentatious beyond-all belief country house, with its 5,000 sq metres of gold leaf and reproduction 'classic' portraits of the family (the Saddam Hussein school of interior decoration) that made me knock over my glass of Sauvignon. This was less 'Wow' than 'How-The-Hell...?', not to mention 'How Much?' Actually, Mr B's had enough of it already - it's yours for 50 million bucks. Cash, of course. But though the image of Mr B's master bedroom suite has seared itself into my cerebral cortex for all time, perhaps the most intriguing image of the week (in a week of extraordinary Olympic images, from the wilting, weeping, disoriented Paula Radcliffe to the triumphant, if disbelieving, Kelly Holmes) came when Brendan Foster told us that, after the 800m, Holmes had her running shoes removed in the changing room by Lord Coe. Is that profoundly sweet and moving, or a great incentive for teenagers to carry on bunking-off PE? Whichever, I can't stop thinking about it - and nor, I suspect, can Kelly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
