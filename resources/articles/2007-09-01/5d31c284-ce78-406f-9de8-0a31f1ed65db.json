It has increased dividends at a compound rate of 17% a year since 1991. The dividends are now so solid that you can safely collect 5% a year just by owning the shares. The brand is known around the world but the richest heritage is in the Far East, which should ensure the next 15 years are even better than the last. Now name this stock market dog. It shares have gone sideways for four years, a period in which markets around the world have soared. A previously conservative management finds itself owning too many junk mortgages in the US and is squandering its Eastern inheritance by failing to make it big in China. Both companies are, of course, HSBC, and the contrasting descriptions illustrate why the assault by Knight Vinke, the activist investor, divides opinion. Eric Knight, after advertising his grievances for several days, yesterday claimed encouragement from nine of HSBC's top 30 investors. If true, he can claim his campaign has had a reasonable start, but a sizeable camp thinks he has chosen the wrong target at the wrong moment. Some investors look at HSBC and see a supertanker - sure, it moves slowly, but it doesn't capsize in rough seas. In the current credit climate, some would say, such banks should be cherished not hounded. Still, there is no harm in a debate and Knight Vinke can usually be relied upon for a few killer facts. At HSBC, it appears to have uncovered a serious short-coming in the structure of incentives for executive directors. A quirk of the three-year bonus plan is that two good years can be sufficient to hit the jackpot even if earnings return to the starting post in the third year. That sounds daft - the result could be an incentive to play safe. But a poorly designed remuneration policy doesn't quite justify the all-singing publicity machine that Knight Vinke has rolled out. The lack of a big idea is odd. At Shell, a past triumph, the fund helped to persuade the oil giant to drop its cumbersome British-Dutch dual structure. At Suez, the great cause was opposition to the Gaz de France deal. At HSBC, it's more vague - a call for a review of group strategy. Again, there's no harm in examining the bank's ambitions, but arguably HSBC is on the case already. It is trying to expand in Asia with a bid for control of KEB in Korea and is belatedly addressing the worry that its global presence hasn't yielded many synergies; chief executive Mike Geoghegan's current buzz phrase is a \"joined-up HSBC\". It may turn out to be flimflam but a programme of disposing of poorly performing pieces - like CCF in France and Household in the US - is hardly more appealing. Buyers might have queued a year ago, but that was then. Add it up and what do we have? A welcome kick up the backside for a management that sleepwalked into the sub-prime mess, and some pressure to sharpen the act in China and to improve boardroom governance. But a structural revolution at HSBC? Unlikely. Roddick lives on Anita Roddick's achievement at the Body Shop was extraordinary, especially when you consider the thin foundation on which it was built. She rarely contained her scepticism about cosmetics in general. \"Anything which claims to remove your wrinkles is a scandalous lie,\" she said in 2000. \"Moisturisers work, but the rest is complete pap.\" After floating the Body Shop in 1984, the great dilemma of her business life was whether to try to return it to private ownership, and so keep it away from the \"pin-striped dinosaurs\" in the City. In 1995, she hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine a plan to raise funds to buy the company on behalf of a charitable trust. Body Shop's profits would then have been donated to humanitarian and environmental causes. It didn't happen for various reasons - the interest payments would have been onerous, and expansion overseas would have been hindered. Instead, Roddick came to an uneasy peace with the City, invested in professional management and then, in 2005, found a buyer in the shape of L'Oreal. The sale still annoys Body Shop purists, but, with hindsight, it looks a sensible decision. Roddick directed her fortune to the Roddick Foundation, which she said a few weeks ago gives away about \u00a33m a year. Its finances are presumably more secure for having investable cash. The charitable trust envisaged in 1995 would have had to ride the business cycle and manage a company. There was another good reason for selling. The Body Shop may have many good years ahead, but the Anita Roddick brand will be remembered far longer. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
