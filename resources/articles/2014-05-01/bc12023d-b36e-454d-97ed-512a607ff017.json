A win against South Korea in Aubagne would have secured that place well in advance of Friday but a draw against Colombia will still take England through to face France or Portugal on goal difference. Brazil have now won Group B, and will play France or Portugal in the final. Fulham\u2019s Cauley Woodrow opened the scoring on three minutes for England, who looked comfortable in the early stages but failed to build on their advantage. South Korea then came into the game strongly and Chang Min-lee deservedly equalised from long range in the 55th minute. Woodrow almost won it for England late on but on balance a draw was a fair result. England\u2019s manager, Gareth Southgate, was disappointed but philosophical afterwards. \u201cWe would rather be through and have it all done and dusted but it\u2019s not a bad experience for our boys to go into the game against Colombia with something resting on it,\u201d he said. Southgate added that England will go for the win against Colombia rather than trying to engineer a point. \u201cThere\u2019s no point playing for the draw,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
