Jean Cobb received the award in the Queen's birthday honours of June 2002 in recognition of her work for charity. Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP, said last night he would ask the Cabinet Office about the award after Channel 4 News reported that her charitable work involved secretarial services to three charities - Jewish Care, Jewish Free School and Community Service Volunteers - all of which are headed by Lord Levy. The news came a week after Tony Blair's chief fundraiser and Middle East envoy was arrested by police investigating allegations that honours were granted in return for financial support to political parties. No charges have been brought in the investigation and Lord Levy strongly denies any wrongdoing. Last night Mr Lamb asked for details of why Mrs Cobb's MBE had been awarded and who had nominated her. \"Is this a proper basis on which an MBE is awarded?\" he asked. \"Was Mrs Cobb given preferential treatment as a result of her position as Lord Levy's secretary?\" A spokeswoman for Lord Levy confirmed that Mrs Cobb had been his secretary until her retirement. A statement later released on Mrs Cobb's behalf by Lord Levy's spokesman read: \"I was surprised and very proud to have received an honour for my charity work. For many, many years, I have frequently worked late nights and over weekends helping to arrange charity functions and carrying out secretarial and administrative work on their behalf. \"I certainly didn't expect any honour. When my retirement at 65 was coming up, some of the charities I had helped got together and I think they nominated me. Going to the palace and receiving the MBE was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
