Don't, say the experts", "bodyText": "Women who leave it late to embrace motherhood are often criticised for gambling with their fertility and risking their own and their baby's health. But now a leading academic says it's better for many women to delay getting pregnant. Professor Elizabeth Gregory says older mothers are financially secure and happy to put their careers on hold while they bring up baby, and are more likely than younger first-time mothers to be in stable relationships. They also live longer. Her new book will be welcome news for pregnant Jennifer Lopez, 38, and Halle Berry, 41, who just are the latest to join the growing club of celebrity older first-time mothers that includes Desperate Housewives' Marcia Cross, who had twins recently at 44, and Salma Hayek, 41, who became a mother in March. The average age of British women giving birth is stable at 29, but the numbers of women choosing to start families in their late thirties and early forties has risen sharply. In 2006 in England and Wales, more than 22,000 women over 40 had babies, of whom nearly 5,500 were giving birth for the first time. Other figures suggest this is a trend: in 2005, 10 times as many women - 102,228 - had their first child between 35 and 39 as in 1975 and 13 times as many had their first between 40 and 44. British actress Patricia Hodge is among them, having had her two children in her forties. Until now, these women have been worried that they are risking both their health and the welfare of the babies by choosing to start families later. But that view is challenged in Gregory's book, due out in January, Ready: Why Women Are Embracing the New Later Motherhood. 'I have found an overwhelming number and range of reasons why what I have termed the \"new later mothers\" are absolutely right to delay motherhood,' said Gregory, director of the Women's Studies Programme at the University of Houston. 'For one thing, they have a stronger family focus and feel ready to focus on family rather than trying to juggle priorities because they have achieved many of their personal and career goals. 'They also have more financial power, because new later mothers have established careers and higher salaries. They also have greater self-confidence, because they have more career experience and their management skills often translate directly into managing a household and advocating for their children.' In addition, said Gregory, these mothers have an unusually high marriage rate. Almost 85 per cent are married, but older single first-time mothers tend to have a more stable support network than their younger counterparts. Gregory's book is one of a number of new studies in praise of older mothers. One, of 4,300 older mothers published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that women who delay starting a family until later are more likely to have brighter, well behaved children. The explanation, the authors said, could be both biological - older mothers make sure they have better nutrition during pregnancy - and social: they may have a more established home life that is more conducive to learning. But there could be hidden costs to later motherhood. For example, there is likely to be an increase in the number of children who will lose their parents at a younger age, while their children will not experience having grandparents. 'There is evidence that new later mothers live longer than those who start their families earlier,' said Gregory, pointing to a study from the Population Research Centre at the University of Texas that indicates a woman's reproductive peak is not the best time to start making babies. John Mirowsky, author of the study and a member of the National Institute of Health's scientific review panel on human development and ageing, believes the prime age for childbearing, in terms of maternal health and longevity, lies between 34 and 40. 'Mothers in that age band are healthier than childless women of their same age because while younger women are more fertile and biologically fit, older mothers tend to be more mature and less likely to engage in risky behaviour, and they are more settled educationally, financially and emotionally,' Mirowsky said. Women who wait to give birth, he said, enjoy better health, live longer and have healthier babies. 'There could be a number of reasons for this,' he said. 'Getting an education and establishing themselves in a good financial situation raise the chances that people will have good healthcare and make informed decisions about their health.' His study is backed by others, including the New England Centenarian Study led by Thomas Perls, which found that women who gave birth after 40 were four times more likely to live to be 100 or more than women in the general population. Nevertheless, Gregory believes the best argument for later motherhood is an emotional one. 'For the women I spoke with, and for their families, the new later motherhood experience has had overwhelmingly positive effects,' she said. 'These women live in a very different world from the one the media portray. They enjoy motherhood immensely and most combine it with satisfying work. These women feel they've come to motherhood prepared and that their children, their marriages, their careers and their sanity are the better for it.' Anita Lowe, a 47-year-old mother of two young children, was recently mistaken for their grandmother but she was most shocked at the response when she tried to clear up the misunderstanding. 'I was buying them coats when a sales assistant referred to the kids as my grandchildren,' said Lowe. 'I happily corrected her but I was stunned when she replied, almost angrily: \"But why would you want to have kids at your age?\" ' The assistant, also in her late forties, explained that one of her two teenagers had left home and she was counting the days until her youngest followed suit. 'She couldn't wait to do all those things she'd wanted to do for years,' said Lowe. 'I just thought it was tragic that she was wishing away the last few years of being a mother. I can go on about the benefits of being an older mother, but a main advantages is that I've had a life devoted to me, and now I'm absolutely ready to have a life devoted to my children.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
