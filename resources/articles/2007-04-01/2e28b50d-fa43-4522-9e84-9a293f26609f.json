Unchosen, her fate was to attract a mass of contradictory prejudices about women: working mothers, women at war and oppressive anti-women religion. This week her story meshed neatly with yet another bid to terrify mothers who use day nurseries while they go to work. Pictured cradling her newborn baby, here was Faye Turney as Madonna, cruelly put in peril. But here too was the image of a derelict mother who went to sea for months on end to pursue her own career, leaving behind her baby, now three years old. Then suddenly there she was in demure hijab, double symbol of oppression, doubly captive. The obligation to wear it is always oppression: free choice is another matter. But what's this? There she is again in her hijab - this time smoking. Here was a deeply problematic picture: good mothers of small children don't smoke, but rough, tough Navy Cut sailors do. The pathos of a mother put in harm's way made her the obvious choice to be obliged to write dictated letters of apology calling for Britain to withdraw from Iraq. So here were plentiful potent images to rouse up the old anti-feminist enemy, even while her life was in danger. \"Despite being a committed feminist, I feel there are certain rather ugly jobs that it is not right, for various reasons, to expect a woman to do. One is going on frontline duties with the armed forces\", wrote one pompous rightwing commentator. I could be wrong, but I don't remember this \"committed feminist\" in the frontline in our struggles. Nor do I recall him castigating Mrs Thatcher for having farmed her troublesome twins. The Daily Mail dispatches women to attack other women. One questioned \"Faye's 'right' to pursue the career she loves,\" asking \"Was I the only one who wondered about her little daughter's right to have the mum she loves at home, watching her grow up?\" Alas, she was not. Another, in the Mail again, wrote: \"I would argue that there comes a time - and motherhood is it - when life isn't simply about proving yourself but about being responsible for someone else.\" It continues: \"All this in the name of what is called 'equality' but which is actually a misguided belief that men and women are the same.\" Another woman in the Sunday Times wrote a piece entitled: \"A mother's place isn't in the war zone\", and there was much, much more of this. Turney is an experienced sea-survival specialist. She pilots rigid hull inflatable speedboats, outranking several of the other captured sailors among her crew. What she herself said shortly before being captured was this: \"You can't sit back just because you're a girl... I know by doing this job that I can give my daughter everything she wants in life and hopefully by seeing me doing what I do, she'll grow up knowing that a woman can have a family and have a career at the same time.\" Her daughter, she said, is \"a top girl and will grow up to be a very reliable, independent, strong young woman, which is exactly what I want for her.\" That brilliant riposte stands as the best answer to all the above nonsense. She has a husband at home minding the baby. That's how some couples work. It's all too rare and others don't choose to live this way. But the attacks on her show how hard it still is for women and men to follow their own inclination if that runs against the rigid straitjacket of Barbie and Action Man sexual destiny. It is not that women and men are the same, but the differences between most women and most men are no greater (and often much less) than other profound human differences in character, skill, brain, status or taste. Yet gender still trumps all else. Liberation of both sexes from their pink and blue fate has hardly begun. Still, amid all the high tension, here was a revelatory moment: the Daily Mail believes pretty much the same as President Ahmadinejad. The fundamentalist Iranian opined: \"How can you justify seeing a mother away from her home, her children? Why don't they respect family values in the west? Why was the difficult task of searching the seas given to a mother thousands of miles from home? Why is there no respect for motherhood, for the love of her child?\" The fundamentalist Mail printed those words in bold letters in a special box. Paul Dacre couldn't have put it better himself. Bewailing the west's lost family values, his paper finds ways to warn against the moral danger of mothers working every day of the week. So hear the gloating: \"Children pay the price of being rushed into nursery\". The anti-childcare backlash was given a boost this week with research suggesting that over 35 hours of group care from a very young age makes some children aggressive. These \"explosive findings have blown holes in a decade of government policy\". All the usual suspects have piled in to have a go. Talk about making the evidence fit the opinion and the leader line. This is gross distortion of nuanced research. It did find a modest increase in both aggression and anxiety in a small number of children who stay over 35 hours a week. But that has been presented as if it were a major and inevitable impact for all children in all childcare. The research did also show the children were more sociable and more confident. It found nurseries have let many women work for the first time, helping them and their children to escape child-damaging poverty. But the finding that really matters is that quality is crucial. Too many nurseries have badly trained staff and no full-time nursery teacher: state run nurseries are better than private, as they have more trained staff. These are the important lessons. Sweden and other Nordic countries, who have had good universal childcare for decades, don't do it on the cheap. The UK spends less than half what they spend: half their childcare staff have degrees. No research suggests the Nordics have been turning out generations of sociopaths: their children score at the top of wellbeing charts where the UK is at the bottom. Who would doubt that long hours in cheap nurseries are bad for children? But watch how this research is used by the \"send-mothers-home brigade\" and the Tories who want to cut back costs on under-fives. It is a reminder of how precarious still is women's progress, always obliged to defend small gains, from abortion laws to the right to work: it's painfully easy to terrify mothers about their children. Meanwhile the CBI resists longer maternity leave, the right to flexible working hours for all parents or raising the minimum wage, which mostly helps women. The 17% gap in women's pay keeps mothers poor, their traditional but vital caring jobs valued less than men's work just because traditionally low-paid women do it. And how has it come about that unbearably destructive pressures on girls to be beautiful are worse, not better, than 20 years ago? Leading Seaman Turney is no doubt typical of the 10% of women who make up the armed forces, and she probably thought old battles about gender discrimination long won. But she will get a shocking reminder to the contrary when she reads what has been said about her. It will be a reminder that the women's revolution is still less than half-won. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
