But just a few blocks back from the neon glare the brash casinos give way to the more mundane chains such as McDonald's, Taco Bell and Walgreens, which line the boulevards that stretch back to the desert. It is in competitive retail markets like Las Vegas that Tesco is taking its biggest gamble yet by launching Fresh &amp; Easy, a chain it believes has the potential to become as familiar a sight as 7-Eleven, which has more than 5,000 stores dotted around the country. On Wednesday five stores will open in Vegas, part of a first wave of 200 openings planned for the West Coast between now and the end of next year. 'This is the Beverly Hills of Las Vegas,' says taxi driver Ramone Jimenez as we speed along to the second of two stores on Tropicana Avenue. The drive takes us past two gated communities, Spanish Trail and Rhodes Ranch, their high walls offering only glimpses of the luxury homes behind. Fresh &amp; Easy is tucked away on a brand new retail park between a Walgreens pharmacy and Jerry's Tux rental shop, its green branding muted by comparison to the bright lights of the Strip. Sparkling SUVs fill the car park as locals drop by for appointments at the neighbouring dentist or to rent a tuxedo. The upmarket surroundings, with no rivals in sight, look like an open goal for such an aggressive retailer. But with the average Las Vegas family earning around $50,000 (\u00a324,000) a year, not everyone lives in Spanish Trail and it is with the store closest to the Strip that Tesco will have to fight hardest to attract tired card dealers and cocktail waitresses on their way home. Tim Mason, the veteran Tesco marketer spearheading the project, insists that the small supermarkets, with their bias towards fresh and organic foods, will appeal to a broad demographic, including the blue-collar workers who battle to make ends meet amid rising petrol and falling house prices. At the eight-lane intersection, Fresh &amp; Easy stares down established player Smith's. The spacious store has everything including a pharmacist, counters offering fresh meat, fish and bread and a large organic produce selection with picture-perfect apple displays. Fresh &amp; Easy looks very different to the British Tesco Express convenience chain on which it is modelled. Its muted green branding and spartan layout has a utilitarian feel which one Los Angeleno unfavourably described as 'a warehouse with some random organic stuff thrown in' - a bit like rival value chain Food4Less. However, Tesco, renowned for its ability to metamorphose in new markets, has positioned itself carefully to fit in with the huge net cast by Trader Joe's, a 300-store chain owned by German discounter Aldi, which is Wal-Mart and Fresh &amp; Easy's closest rival. Tesco has also decided not to roll out its ClubCard here, which has been the secret weapon behind its UK growth: store marketing material promises 'no need for loyalty cards or product coupons. These are everyday low prices'. The chain's unexpected debut in Hemet, California, caused a minor sensation earlier this week among its fast-growing population - albeit one that is biased towards senior citizens. But many of the customers were looking rather than shopping. 'The selection is good but some of the prices are a little high,' says Gerry Jay, pointing to a Digiorno pepperoni pizza on sale at $5.29. 'This store is expensive,' adds Ed Marchand as he sizes up a packet of boneless Angus beef fillets at $20.99. Around half the products on sale are Fresh &amp; Easy's own brand, which includes organic and locally sourced produce that goes beyond basics such as salad and milk. A key area is high-margin ready meals, such as beef lasagne or chicken enchiladas with rice &amp; beans, that at less than $5 contain no artificial flavours or trans fats. Fresh &amp; Easy has also played the green card, building energy efficient stores and making much of its pledge to be a good 'neighbor' and to serve all areas including the inner city 'food deserts'. But pressure groups in LA, where 18 per cent of families live below the poverty line, are already fearful that the promises are just spin, after it emerged that only a handful of the 70 openings planned for the city were in deprived areas. Tesco insists it is committed to opening stores from 'Hollywood Boulevard to Compton' but unease has been fuelled by its decision to go 'non-union'. Powerful Californian unions have secured middle-class salaries for shop workers and Tesco's pledge to pay $10 an hour - albeit more than Wal-Mart - for ostensibly part-time positions has disappointed. Its decision to use only self-service check-outs is seen to be a by-product of this as cashiers are typically higher-paid roles. Observers point out that this is also a blow to Fresh &amp; Easy's green credentials: most of the food has to be packaged in order to carry a barcode. But Planet Retail analyst Bryan Roberts says feedback on the chain has been positive. 'It is unlike any American supermarket. It is a unique operating model and one that is very much based around efficiency and a convenient shopping experience. I have no doubt Tesco will succeed.' Critics refer to the long list of retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots the Chemists and Sainsbury's who have tried and failed to break the market due to misunderstanding the American psyche. Tesco's winning streak has lasted a decade under chief executive Sir Terry Leahy and with a $700bn grocery market to go for in the USA, his luck shows no sign of running out yet. A big-small war Wal-Mart is not taking Tesco's invasion of its home turf lying down: the giants of world retailing are headed for a desert showdown. A traditional Wal-Mart Supercentre could swallow a 10,000 sq ft Fresh &amp; Easy store 10 times over, but the US behemoth is slimming for a face-off in the dusty Californian outpost of Coachella Valley, where both it and Tesco plan openings early next year. That Tesco has committed \u00a31bn to expanding Fresh &amp; Easy over five years has surprised US analysts. There are rumblings that the British grocer is already considering opening a second distribution centre in Florida, pushing its sights beyond its initial launch states of California, Nevada and Arizona. No other major supermarket chain is pursuing a small store strategy but that looks set to change. As well as opening smaller neighbourhood stores in places like Coachella, Wal-Mart has registered the names City Thyme and Field &amp; Vine, which could be used for a new 'urban fresh' format. Other store chains are also considering getting smaller in order to get bigger. Safeway boss Steve Burd once questioned the economics of small stores, but now says that if Tesco's work, Safeway will do it better. Natural foods retailer Whole Foods is launching an Express format, and while Supervalu, which also owns Albertsons, has opened a natural and organics chain called Sunflower Market. 'Everyone is looking to get out of the mainstream and into a niche market,' says Planet Retail analyst Bryan Roberts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
