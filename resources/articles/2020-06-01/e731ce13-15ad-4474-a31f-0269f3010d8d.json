The rent", "bodyText": "The reopening of thousands of stores, combined with May\u2019s 12% rebound in sales, has provided some respite for Britain\u2019s\u2019s battered retailers, but the high street crisis is far from over \u2013 not least because a monster \u00a32.5bn quarterly rent bill falls due this week. Shop landlords traditionally collect rent in four equal chunks spread throughout the year, and Midsummer Day on Wednesday is the next so-called \u201cquarter day\u201d. The last one, in March, was a red-letter day for all the wrong reasons, with Primark and JD Sports among the big names that didn\u2019t pay their rent as the country went into lockdown. At best, about half the rent due in March was handed over and property experts think June\u2019s take will be even less, as cash-strapped retailers take advantage of a temporary ban on evictions for non-payment of rent \u2013 which the government has extended to the autumn \u2013 to conserve cash and negotiate new deals with landlords. \u201cThe amount of rent paid by retailers will be the lowest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d says Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy at property advisory firm Harper Dennis Hobbs. \u201cRetailers will take the opportunity not to pay because, frankly, they haven\u2019t had any cash flow, so why would they? Some have had no money through their tills for months.\u201d The growth of online shopping meant the high street was under pressure before coronavirus struck, but the upheaval it has created now threatens the survival of thousands of retailers and the millions of jobs they support. Around 1.6 million retail workers have been furloughed \u2013 more than in any other sector \u2013 in an industry newly hobbled by the social distancing constraints placed on stores. The likelihood is that high streets and shopping-centre visitor numbers will be depressed for months to come, be it for health or financial reasons as recession looms \u2013 leaving managers to assess whether some stores will ever be viable again. Long before coronavirus struck, the asset manager Fidelity International predicted that rent on the high street and in shopping centres needed to fall by up to 40% if bricks-and-mortar retailers were going to have a future in the internet age. Adrian Benedict at Fidelity says the health crisis has hastened that correction. \u201cRetailers that continue to operate out of these locations will be demanding lower rents in return for lease extensions or the like, or you\u2019re going to see increasing numbers of businesses going into administration. That is the sad reality. It is no longer a choice, it is a necessity.\u201d There are already signs that, after months with stores out of action, retailers are running out of cash. The upmarket fashion brand AllSaints \u2013 which says it was doing well before the crisis \u2013 is the latest high street name to use an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to wring rent reductions from its landlords and stave off administration. There have already been thousands of high street job losses, with buyout deals brokered for names such as Oasis, Warehouse and Cath Kidston, all involving the jettisoning of their stores. The scale of the crisis means the British Property Federation is expecting only around a quarter of the June rent bill to be paid \u2013 a lowly figure that will have a domino effect on property firms and their investors, many of whom manage pension-fund cash. \u201cIn private, many asset managers are terrified about what might come to pass on June quarter day and fear it could be worse than in March,\u201d says Steph Yates, a senior consultant at Remit Consulting, which tracks rent-collection data. \u201cIt is fair to say that some asset managers are fearing a large number of insolvencies across their portfolios.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
