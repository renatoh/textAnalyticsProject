Faced with a crime, he would countenance every conclusion apart from the obvious one: don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan. In discussing the terrible tale of Mick Philpott's six dead children, it has not been the left but the right that has downgraded individual moral responsibility, by playing up the supposed role of \"the system\". Not, you understand, the system of structural inequality, monopoly capital or other slogans that might have framed common room arguments in a Malcolm Bradbury novel. No, it is today the \"welfare system\" that gets casually damned as the mother of all evils. How precisely tax credits and housing benefit payments persuaded a man to set ablaze a home packed with his slumbering offspring is not explained. Instead, the running demand in parts of the press \u2013 echoed by George Osborne \u2013 is that \"a debate\" must follow this case, a debate progressive opinion supposedly shrinks from. On Friday, leading Lib Dems distanced themselves from an ugly attempt to exploit lost young lives to justify the benefit cuts which begun biting this week; but the prime minister weighed in behind his chancellor. Care was of course taken to mention Philpott's personal culpability, but the privileged partners of Downing Street both leapt from the specifics of one case to generalities about \"subsidised lifestyles\" of millions of benefit claimants. The debate being launched has no more regard for the truth than that Mr Cameron sparked by branding the fatal neglect of Baby P by his 27-year old mother \"a story about a 17-year-old girl who had no idea how to bring up a child\". Factoids are once again spinning out of control \u2013 the ubiquitous claim that Philpott was better-off lounging around on his sofa than in a \u00a3100,000 job is achieved by such brazen tricks as counting his wife's cleaning wages as benefits. Truth, it seems, is the first casualty of class war. A real debate about the Philpott case would start with the sentencing remarks written by the judge who had listened carefully to every scrap of evidence. Mrs Justice Thirlwall's main conclusion concerned the pathological egocentricity of the chief perpetrator, but \u2013 if one wanted to draw out something more systematic about society \u2013 she had interesting things to say about his overbearing misogyny, how he was able to get away with things as he did only by bullying women into being his \"chattels\". Insofar as the motive had anything that might be called a social policy angle, it concerned a battle over child custody, the sort of battle fought by families at all incomes levels, on benefits and in work. A real debate about social security would, therefore, have to be a different discussion entirely. It would need to grapple with rising public concern about \"the undeserving poor\", but also with the roots of that concern, roots one serious analysis locates in the harsh rhetoric about the unemployed that New Labour adopted in the mid-1990s. It would wrestle, too, with the neglected reality that the bulk of the \"welfare bill\" \u2013 and by far the most important prospective pressure upon it \u2013 is payments to pensioners, and with the fact that ever-more social spending is consumed by topping-up poverty pay, for example through tax credits. Above all, it should attempt to lend substance to the homilies that all politicians mouth about social mobility, exploring how to create paths from workless homes into decent jobs, particularly for poor children who never asked to be born. That might be a fitting tribute to the Philpott youngsters whose lives were cut short before they could discover their future. Instead, the big idea of the week is to visit the sins of overly productive fathers upon their many children, by cutting off the financial support for third- and fourth-borns. A crime with too many victims is being twisted in a manner which risks creating many more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
