A first-half own goal by Philippe Senderos appeared to have set up the Gunners' first defeat of the season at the Emirates, and only their second-ever reverse there, as Villa gave a valiant performance in north London. But Nicklas Bendtner was left unmarked following a corner to score from close range and keep Arsenal at the summit by the slenderest of margins. The Gunners, without a win in three matches, were denied victory at Birmingham last Saturday when James McFadden made it 2-2 in the last minute at St Andrews, but this time Arsenal grabbed a late leveller at the expense of the second city's other side. The hosts enjoyed much of the possession throughout an intriguing contest but their defence, and Senderos in particular, were caught out on the counter-attack when Gabriel Agbonlahor raced away from William Gallas and centred for John Carew on 27 minutes. Senderos reached the ball ahead of the big Norwegian, but could only send it past the helpless Manuel Almunia. Although Villa defender Curtis Davies was stretchered off before the break, the visitors should have extended their lead when Shaun Maloney's fierce 25-yard strike came back off the post and, although Cesc Fabregas and Aleksander Hleb both missed chances for the hosts, the visitors created numerous chances of their own, with both Ashley Young and Marlon Harewood going close. Martin O'Neill's side would have moved level on points with fourth-placed Everton, but Bendtner put paid to that notion. United made the most of Arsenal's slip with a comfortable success at Craven Cottage. Owen Hargreaves opened the scoring on the quarter-hour mark, catching Antti Niemi off guard with a curling free-kick for his first goal for the club. Sir Alex Ferguson decided to rest both Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and, in their absence, Ji-Sung Park took his chance to score his first league goal of the campaign, heading Paul Scholes' lofted pass in off the underside of the bar on the stroke of half-time. Midway through the second half Rooney and Ronaldo came on and within seconds the champions were three up, courtesy of an own goal by Simon Davies. Three goals in five first-half minutes accounted for West Ham as Chelsea bounced back from their Carling Cup defeat with an emphatic victory at Upton Park. The deadlock was broken by Frank Lampard, who beat Robert Green with a 17th-minute penalty following a foul by Anton Ferdinand. Another former Hammer doubled the Blues' lead three minutes later as Joe Cole stole in to drive in Nicolas Anelka's lay-off and Michael Ballack made it 3-0 with a stunning volley from range midway through the first half. Chelsea had Lampard controversially sent off on 36 minutes, following an incident with Luis Boa Morte, but some dogged defending, including an overhead clearance off the line by John Terry, and a further goal by Ashley Cole on 64 minutes, his first for the club, helped Avram Grant's side move to within seven points of the summit. The elation of last weekend's Carling Cup win seemed a long way off for Tottenham as Juande Ramos's side were trounced 4-1 by Birmingham, who completed a league double over the Londoners. Mikael Forsell helped himself to a hat-trick against a Spurs side sorely missing injured Wembley goalscorer Jonathan Woodgate and Ledley King. Forsell scored on seven, 59 and 81 minutes and Sebastien Larsson sent a free-kick beyond Paul Robinson ten minutes after the break as Spurs, without the dropped Robbie Keane, Jermaine Jenas and Aaron Lennon, capitulated. Substitute Jenas grabbed a late consolation but the 4-1 win keeps Alex McLeish's side a point above the relegation zone. That point would have been three but for Reading's late winner at Middlesbrough. James Harper, on his 300th appearance for the Royals, struck to end a run of eight straight defeats and, although they remain in the relegation zone, their bid for survival remains alive after a morale-boosting win. The news was not so good for Newcastle, who squandered a raft of chances before losing at home to Blackburn. Damien Duff, Michael Owen and Alan Smith were all guilty of misses before Matt Derbyshire grabbed a late winner for Rovers. After their 0-0 draw at Derby, Sunderland are now just a point behind Newcastle, who remain winless under Kevin Keegan and are themselves just three points above safety."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
