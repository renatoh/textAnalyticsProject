Yet those with longer memories will recall the 1955 final, which brought the Newcastle team of Jackie Milburn, Jimmy Scoular and Bobby Mitchell face to face with City's Revie plan. This involved nothing more profound than Don Revie wearing No9 but dropping deep to draw the opposing centre-half, an idea born of the confusion caused among England's defenders when Hungary's Nandor Hidegkuti, who died this week, had done much the same at Wembley the previous season. The tactic had been worked out by Revie and Les McDowall, who was managing City, a dour, taciturn Scot compared with whom Alex Ferguson is a second Billy Connolly. Simple though the plan was by today's standards it surprised a game long accustomed to pigeon-holing players by the numbers on their shirts. If a centre-half did not have a No9 to mark he became disoriented. It went wrong for City at Wembley that season not so much because Newcastle twigged what they were about but because City had to play for all but 18 minutes of the game with 10 men, Jimmy Meadows, their right-back, having torn knee ligaments. In the ensuing reorganisation the Revie plan was abandoned and Newcastle won 3-1. Had substitutes been allowed, Revie would probably have been able to stay in his deep, roving role, though whether this would have altered the result is debatable since Milburn had already headed Newcastle in front after 45 seconds. In any case the wisdom of relying on a strategy that depends heavily on one player was as questionable then as it is now. Yet there will always be certain footballers who become the core of a team's actions and thoughts, which is where Sven-Goran Eriksson comes in. For whether the England coach likes it or not he will be going to the World Cup with a G-plan which has nothing to do with the 1960s furniture that challenged the reign of sideboards and settees. The G in this instance stands for Gerrard, Steven of that name, who this summer will be England's best means of consistently bringing the ball forward without giving it away, not unlike Revie. The acrobatic equaliser Darius Vassell scored against Holland on Wednesday may have prompted thoughts of the Aston Villa striker perhaps becoming Eriksson's Toto Schillaci, after the small Sicilian who broke Italy's goal drought in the 1990 World Cup, but should the chronic problems Gerrard has had with back, groin and thigh injuries resurface the damage to England's chances of a successful tournament would be irreparable. Of the present squad only the Liverpool midfielder seemingly has the ability to win the ball deep in his own half, or collect it from one of England's back four, and either exploit the acceleration of Michael Owen or Emile Heskey with a 40-yard pass or drive forward to create space and then link up with the strikers. Take this away and, while Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Frank Lampard and certainly David Beckham can each reproduce something of Gerrard's game, none will ever add up to a complete alternative. Beckham has come closest with his Stakhanovite performance against Greece, and the England captain has needed three months to recover from it. Unhappily for Eriksson the only player who might perform a comparable service is Newcastle's Kieron Dyer who, having emerged from one long- term injury in excellent form, is now in danger of missing the World Cup with another. Dyer may be no Gerrard - his quick give-and-get style is more reminiscent of Alan Ball - but in terms of giving Owen or Heskey an early release past defenders the effect might bear comparison. England still do not have much luck with their better midfield players. Walter Winterbottom's plans for the 1962 World Cup in Chile were thrown into disarray by the last-minute loss of Bobby Robson, who as England manager went to Mexico and Italy in 1986 and 1990 not knowing whether Bryan Robson was going to get through the next game. At least Bobby Robson was able to draft in Steve Hodge for one tournament and David Platt for another after his namesake had gone home. Neither player was a Bryan Robson but both performed commendably. If similar alternatives to Gerrard or Dyer are lying in wait they are remarkably well hidden. So for Eriksson it would appear to be the G-plan or nothing. As to the Revie plan, it thrived at Wembley the following season when Manchester City won the FA Cup with an emphatic 3-1 victory over Birmingham. Even then chance played a part, for Revie was recalled only on the morning of the final because Billy Spurdle had boils. Any pains experienced by City at St James' Park tomorrow may prove less providential. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
