The Knepp estate wilding project (Report, 21 May) has seen a fast and encouraging reversal of loss of wildlife. Elaine Steane Oxford \u2022 I am sitting in my garden enjoying the evening sunshine, a rare occasion this summer, when I realise something is wrong. No birds in the sky. No swallows. No housemartins. No swifts. Where are they? This is quite scary. We are in the middle of June; the skies should be full of birds on the wing. Is this global warming, overhunting or pesticides killing off their food supply? Whatever the reason, I hope it is a temporary glitch and that next year will see their return. Tina Baker Chudleigh Knighton, Devon \u2022 If male MPs were the ones having babies there would no doubt be maternity leave (I\u2019m pregnant but denied maternity leave as an MP. Why?, 18 June). Helen Evans Ruthin, Denbighshire \u2022 I\u2019m pleased to see extensive coverage of the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. In future, should we refer to Men\u2019s Cricket and the Men\u2019s Premier League etc? Hugh Closs London \u2022 I was told that the \u201cyou must not split an infinitive\u201d injunction in English is a hangover from Latin, in which the infinitive is a single word \u2013 for instance, \u201camare\u201d, \u201cto love\u201d \u2013 so cannot be split. This, of course, is irrelevant in English. Chris Evans Earby, Lancashire \u2022 How disappointing (Wordsearch, 17 June) that Bingo and Karaoke are forms of entertainment but Pub and Shag are not!
