Since then we have been stuck in pack ice. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long has given up its attempt to rescue us as ice sheets continue to spread and thicken. Now Xue Long is waiting for the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis to join it in a joint bid to free our ship. Meanwhile, passengers play Scrabble, watch film marathons in the auditorium, and wander on to the ice to build igloos or to take photographs of passing penguins and our ship stuck in the ice. We are at Cape de la Motte in East Antarctica, on our way to the Mertz glacier, in a sea covered in ice floes up to four metres thick and several years old, making them dense and tough. Winds have pushed these floes towards the Antarctic mainland and pinned us in. The Xue Long arrived on Friday evening and spent 12 hours pushing its way through the dense ice before its captain decided enough was enough. We were only two nautical miles from the ocean before Christmas, but that distance has now swelled to around 20 nautical miles as the blizzards and winds have continued. If the joint efforts of the Aurora Australis and Xue Long don't work, the only other option will be to evacuate the ship by air, though this would be the absolute worst case scenario. I am with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, led by climate scientist Chris Turney of the University of New South Wales. We are following a century-old expedition led by the British-Australian Antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson, who landed in Commonwealth Bay in January 1912. We \u2013 a group of scientists and paying members of the public acting as science assistants \u2013 plan to repeat many of Mawson's scientific measurements in order to understand how this pristine landscape has changed over the past 100 years. Mawson was an explorer in the same league as Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton. He was the first to take a plane to the continent and the first to send back wireless signals. He also encountered tragedy: during a three-man winter trek into the continent's interior, Mawson's two colleagues died. He returned to his base camp after a month of unimaginable hardship and found he had missed his ship back home and had to spend another year on the continent. We arrived at Commonwealth Bay more than a week ago, dropping anchor at the edge of a glistening sheet of fast ice \u2013 so called because it is stuck fast to the edge of the land mass of Antarctica. In front of us was an alien landscape of pure, flat white. The expedition's scientists began their work. Marine ecologist Tracey Rogers took biopsies and fur from several Weddell seals, material that will help her build a picture of what these animals have been eating for the past few years. Changes in food would be a signal that the Antarctic environment is irrevocably changing. A major goal was to visit Cape Denison, where Mawson set up his base camp. He was able to sail straight into the area but access has since been blocked by a 75-mile-long iceberg called B09B. In the intervening years the water in the bay has become encrusted with ice and the only way to get to Cape Denison is by air or land. Just over a week ago, 11 of us made the 140km round trip from our ship to Mawson's Huts using Argo vehicles \u2013 a cross between a 4x4 buggy and a small boat \u2013 to drive across the ice and snow. Freshly melted pools of sludgy water slowed us down but, at a steady pace and starting around 8am, we got to Cape Denison just before lunchtime. We were humbled by the accommodation of the original expedition. Mawson's main hut, where 18 men lived for months at a time, had a footprint of 7.3 square metres and a pyramid roof. Two levels of bunks lined the outside walls, while Mawson had his own cubicle at one side. His men built the huts from timber pre-cut to size. Ornithologist Kerry-Jayne Wilson counted the populations of Ad\u00e9lie penguins. She found what she had feared \u2013 numbers in decline \u2013 and something worse: bodies of dead chicks littering the rookeries and many eggs not being properly incubated. These birds feed on the seashore, which has moved some 70km thanks to ice around Cape Denison. Every extra kilometre the penguins have to walk reduces the energy available for rearing young. Until iceberg B09B melts and the fast ice dissipates and returns open water to Cape Denison, penguin numbers will continue to drop. What happens to us now is anyone's guess. If we hadn't got stuck in ice last week, we would have visited Macquarie Island, an ecological jewel between Antarctica and New Zealand. There, scientists had ambitious plans to study penguin colonies and take geological samples to help reconstruct past climates. However, as we wait to be freed, it is probably a mistake to think about the future: because if there's one thing I've learned in my brief time in this desolate, still and intriguing continent, it is that, in Antarctica, you can't make plans. Here you can only have intentions. And a lot of hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
