No longer the Vulcan, John Redwood was a volcano about to erupt. Seething with hostility to anything European and adoring of all things American, the former Thatcherite policy-shaper recited the classic Conservative mantra in a masterly fashion. Flanked by Times columnist Michael Gove, author of Michael Portillo: The Future of the Right (that got more than a chuckle from the audience), and writer Frederic Raphael, Mr Redwood was first up to defend the motion that \"the Channel is wider than the Atlantic\". His team won the debate, but his performance won the day. In the most rousing part of his speech, Mr Redwood declared: \"We are attached to American brands and dreams, especially the anti-Americans among us!\" In contrast, he insisted: \"The Channel is bridgeable only by gross misunderstandings\". In what could be a sign of things to come, he then launched a broadside against Tony Blair. \"After six years in power, under the greatest enthusiast of Europe, what has Tony Blair delivered us?\" he asked the 320-strong Kensington crowd, before bellowing \"NO euro, NO defence agreement! Where are these magic moments now?\" He then beamed to the crowd, insisting that he loved \"the differences\" within Europe and that we must embrace \"trade, friendship and cooperation where we can\" with our continental cousins. However, he made it clear that he would never trust \"the neighbours\" with his money. Mr Redwood appeared highly confident that most of the public is behind his eurosceptic stance. His tours of the classrooms of Britain, he claimed, have shown him that the most eurosceptic of all generations (his being the least) are those still at school or university who are, he argued, unanimously self-proclaimed \"Brits - not Europeans\". In retaliation, academic Timothy Garton Ash, author and academic Charles Grant, and French economist Brigitte Granville argued that we should follow our heads - not our hearts - on this issue. In doing so, they claimed, we would find that Mr Redwood and co. overlooked the facts. Mr Garton Ash spoke first. \"Behind this motion,\" he proclaimed, \"is a great denial. It is wilful, ideological and extremist. Yes, our spies and banks are closer to the US, but not our writers, welfare state and the vast majority of our trade.\" He then claimed that, with well over a third of British MPs and over a million members of the public vocally against a proposed war on Iraq, our instincts were closer to France and Germany's than many assumed. Mr Grant rebutted Mr Redwood's impassioned defence of America by claiming that the British people, and their view of international politics, was \"far more European\". He emphasised the width of the Atlantic both in geographical and ideological terms, citing America's embrace of the death penalty, gun control, fundamentalist Christianity and their position on the issue of Palestine as examples of how the Americans are moving away from us. All three speakers concluded that, despite Mr Redwood's empathy for Americans, they certainly did not consider us as close \"over the pond\". The anti-European sentiment in the room was extreme at times as hecklers took over proceedings more than once - due in part to the surprisingly poor chairmanship from Eric Pooley, the editor of Time magazine Europe. At one point there was a stand-off between Mr Raphael and a member of the audience who took particular issue with his dismissal of the \"racist\" nature of recent comments about the French from American media commentators. Then Mr Raphael turned on Mr Garton Ash, who also castigated his comments. Many squirmed in their seats as a despairing member of the crowd shouted: \"Take some control, chairman, please!\" Mr Redwood just smiled knowingly throughout the confrontations. He later told how, when he had been working for Margaret Thatcher, an annual summer circular used to come round begging ministers to stop applying for ministerial trips to Washington, pleading with them to choose Paris or Bonn instead. \"Simply put, no one wanted to go,\" he said, adding (somewhat pompously) that that was because everyone felt more at home in America, \"with the same culture as us and with its fellow mighty Anglo-Saxon history of exporting freedom and democracy to the world\". Mr Redwood's coherent and effective attack on Europe, and admiration for America, may prove very well-timed. With Gordon Brown signalling yesterday that the long-awaited June debate on the euro may be delayed a further year, MrRedwood's return would make him perhaps the leading \"saviour\" of the pound. The public mood seems right, too. As Mr Portillo's recent daily TV appearances have hinted, former Tory cabinet ministers are slowly regaining a place in the public's hearts as the government faces growing dissent over its policies on education, war, Zimbabwe and health. Physically, too, Mr Redwood looks in top form. He has obviously put his time in the political wilderness to good use and now hopes to finally cash in. Presumably in pounds - not euros. \u00b7 John Redwood appeared on stage at The National Geographic Society in favour of the motion: 'The Channel is wider than the Atlantic'.
