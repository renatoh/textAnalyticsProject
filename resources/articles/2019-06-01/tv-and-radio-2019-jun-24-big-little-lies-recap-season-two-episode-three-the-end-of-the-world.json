Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the most recent episode. \u2018These second grade mothers: they\u2019re Shakespearean\u2019 It seems we\u2019ve arrived at the \u201cTell me about your childhood\u2026\u201d section of the group therapy session that is Big Little Lies: Season two. And since the shrink on duty is the astute Dr Reisman (an Emmy-worthy Robin Weigert), you know it\u2019s gonna be a good\u2019un. Bonnie went first, flashing back to a troubling memory of her mother abruptly dunking her head in a pool because \u201cwe have to be able to hold our breath underwater, baby\u201d. Err \u2026 do we? As a metaphor for Bonnie\u2019s drowning mental state, it wasn\u2019t particularly subtle, but it did offer some intriguing insight into their as-yet underwritten relationship. It\u2019s going to take more than a few hours of spiritual yoga practice to bring this mother and daughter inner peace. Next up Madeline, who recalled that time, aged three or four, when she walked in on her father \u201chaving sex with a woman that wasn\u2019t my mom\u201d. Ooof. Even Celeste was wincing in sympathy. Plenty for Dr Reisman to get stuck into, then. Oh, did you assume Streep\u2019s mother-in-law from hell would be serving up this season\u2019s hottest tea? While Mary Louise continued to speak her mind, it was \u201cMadame Shrink\u201d, as Madeline likes to call her, who forced the most discomforting realisations. Could Madeline\u2019s own academic insecurities be at the root of her frustration with her college-dropout daughter? Makes sense. Plus that comparison of domestic violence survivors to soldiers struggling to adjust to peacetime sounded spot on, even if Celeste remains sceptical. Mary Louise\u2019s attention was, mercifully, focused elsewhere, with her attempting to rouse some police interest in her son\u2019s death. That means Perpetually Unimpressed Detective from season one is back and she\u2019s still got no time for these boring rich people with their boring-rich-people problems. The mouth said, \u201cI have personally worked very hard to be mindful of your unspeakable pain,\u201d but the eyes said, \u201cHow long till lunch?\u201d. So it was onto the next stop; an unannounced visit at Jane\u2019s workplace where Mary Louise bluntly requested that little Ziggy be subjected to a paternity test before running down the greatest hits of victim blaming: \u201cWere you drinking?\u201d Check. \u201cYou must have tempted him.\u201d Check. \u201cMixed signals?\u201d Check and check. Miraculously Jane kept her cool, but then herein lies the brilliance of both the Big Little Lies script and Streep\u2019s performance: Even in the midst of their antagonism, some fleeting and achingly beautiful moments of mutual understanding pass between these women; moments in which it\u2019s clear they\u2019re are all just mothers acting out of love for their sons. Or maybe Jane was riding too high on her new romance with Corey from the aquarium to be brought down by pettiness. Monterey does have an array of perfect date spots with giant wine glasses and cosy fire pits; it\u2019s about time they were put to use. On the plus side, this may mean an end to all Jane\u2019s manic-pixie-dream-dancing in the surf with her vintage iPod. (I can only assume this was some kind of Monterey mating ritual?) On the downside, heartbreak looms. Clearly Jane\u2019s new beau is either a) a serial killer b) an undercover cop whose work ethic puts Perpetually Unimpressed Detective to shame or c) Dead Perry\u2019s long-lost half-brother. Not that any of these scenarios would be darker that what\u2019s currently going down between Celeste and the ghost of her abusive dead husband, right before our eyes. Big Little Lies has long danced rather gracefully around the murky issue of abuse entangled with sexual desire, but are they actually going there now? Really going there? Yes, yes they are. Notes and observations If Jane had dodged Corey\u2019s kiss-lunge any more energetically, she\u2019d have fallen into the path of an oncoming bus \u2013 which would have been a bold way to tie up her storyline. Was that moment when Bo Peep removed her prosthetic teeth a foreshadowing of Streep\u2019s season finale showstopper? Let\u2019s hope so! \u201cYou would have jumped into that pool and pulled me out.\u201d Celeste\u2019s sweet words to Madeline are also a neat call-back to that other pool incident. We\u2019ve got Amabella\u2019s \u201cno-cost spared\u201d birthday party to look forward to. Can\u2019t wait. Renata coined a new swear this week, by combining a cute word for a cat with another of her four-letter favourites. Sadly it\u2019s too rude to reproduce here. We got a slightly better view of the exterior of Jane and Ziggy\u2019s supposedly humble beachfront condo this week. It definitely costs at least $2m. \u201cCounselling is certainly indicated \u2026 Perhaps for the entire family\u201d Oooh, Renata gets a sick burn from the ER doctor \u2013 but he has a point. Maybe Dr Reisman could fit them in? The Playlist Bonnie\u2019s mother has adapted Elizabeth Cotten\u2019s Shake Sugaree for a lullaby. When Mary Louise catches a glimpse of her third grandson for the first time, Mojave 3\u2019s Bluebird of Happiness is playing. Roxy Music\u2019s Love Is The Drug soundtracks Jane and Corey\u2019s post-dinner stroll. Madeline\u2019s public breakdown was inspired by Kermit The Frog classic, Rainbow Connection. This week\u2019s closing credits song is the Cowboy Junkies cover of Dreaming My Dreams With You. Quote of The Week \u201cI will be rich again! I will rise up and I will buy a fucking polar bear for every kid In this school!\u201d - Renata expresses her concerns over adding climate change to the school curriculum with characteristic flair.
