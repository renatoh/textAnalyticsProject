The morning and afternoon practice sessions had again been dominated by Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. In the small, steamy garage, mechanics smiled and back-slapped. There were smiles, too, in the motor home, even though a lack of space had robbed it of its customary opulence, for Interlagos is hot, cramped and so wonderfully Jurassic that you expect to meet a mechanic carrying an oily rag and a monkey wrench as he traipses to his stricken car. But, sitting in that motorhome, it was also possible to feel a strong sense of discord. For it was here, on the previous evening, that Webber \u2013 who will surely not drive for Red Bull after this season \u2013talked about Vettel showing all the love and tenderness that Captain Ahab once displayed for Moby Dick. In an amazing outburst, presumably prompted by Red Bull's refusal to instruct Vettel to drive in support of his better-placed team\u2011mate, Webber accused his employers of showing more emotional support to the young German and described himself as \"an inconvenience\". Today Christian Horner, the team principal who has shown considerable firefighter qualities in recent months, was into damage limitation. \"We were surprised at Mark's remarks because he has had tremendous backing at Red Bull, not just this year but in the four seasons he has been with us,\" he said. \"I can only hope his comments were taken out of context, otherwise the team would be very hurt that he felt that he hadn't had the support. In the heat of the moment, people say things they haven't fully thought through.\" But those of us who \u2013 unlike Horner \u2013 sat beside Webber yesterday evening knew better. Webber had not been quoted out of context. There was anger and bitterness in his words and body language and he seemed in very much the same state of mind when he was seen in animated talks with Horner later that evening. The notion that Webber and Vettel are unlikely to exchange Christmas cards next month was given more substance when Vettel was quoted on German TV: \"If Mark needs help then he should take the medical car.\" There is a poison to be purged but it may not happen in time to win a divided Red Bull the world championship that, technically at least, they deserve. With cars designed by the incomparable Adrian Newey, they have won 14 pole positions out of 17 this season, eight times locking out the front row. And even though that grid dominance has been converted into only seven wins (four for Webber) that is still more than any other team. Three times, in Malaysia, Monaco and Japan, they have finished one-two. But for all Horner's admirable egalitarianism \u2013 he has just pledged his future to the team so he, at least, will not be paying the price if Red Bull fail to take the big prize \u2013 a different message has drifted down from a higher level. It is that the team's owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, and consultant Helmut Marko view the young and brilliant Vettel and not the Australian warhorse as the embodiment of their future plans. There was the incident at Silverstone where the front wing of Webber's car was taken off and given to the German. When Webber went on to complete a thrilling victory he said over the in-car radio: \"Not bad for a No2 driver.\" What happened yesterday night may have been a case of Webber making his excuses early. Horner was probably closer to the mark today when he said: \"Mark is a big competitor and driving in the form of his career but they are all going to play mind games.\" Red Bull should already have wrapped up the drivers' and constructors' championships. The drivers have made mistakes and Vettel, twice, has been betrayed by his Renault engine when set for victory. But if Red Bull do not pull it off this year the inevitable inquest will centre on the dynamic between the two drivers and the influence of Mateschitz and Marko. At McLaren there is an even-handedness about the treatment of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button and it is a happy team; at Ferrari Felipe Massa is resigned to his status as Fernando Alonso's stooge, and it works. At Red Bull, though, the current situation clearly cannot continue. \"When you look at our evolution over the last six years it is a phenomenal story,\" said Horner. So it is. But if they again fail to win the drivers' championship it will be mostly forgotten amid the recriminations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
