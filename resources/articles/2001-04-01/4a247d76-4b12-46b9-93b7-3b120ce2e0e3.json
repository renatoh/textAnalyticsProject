The police have finally noticed that her husband Clem's thriving import business is a smuggling operation. The eldest of her six beloved sons has been banged up for stealing a lorryload of cigarettes; the youngest, sweet, brain-damaged Johnny, is worryingly delicate. And Clem himself has bunked off to Spain, apparently with some nubile young thing in tow. How is May going to survive these mounting tragedies? Having already read Deirdre Purcell's 1998 novel Love, Like, Hate, Adore , about an uneducated cleaning lady who stands by her brother when he's accused of rape, I thought when I began Entertaining Ambrose that Purcell was making another refreshingly brave contribution to the neglected genre of social realism. That was until the angel walked in. The angel is the Ambrose of the title, and he certainly gave me a jolt. Not that his presence blows out the social-realism theory - given what might be expected from your average miraculous being, he is frustratingly hands-off when it comes to the daily grind. However, it becomes clear that Purcell is attempting something grander than a sketch of plain people battling bitter fate. It took me a while to work it out, but in the end I realised: May Lanigan is the modern Job. The brief sketch of May's troubles above is a mere foretaste of what's coming. For over half her life she's devoted herself to others. Why, then, must she be stripped of her possessions, robbed of blind innocence and blissful ignorance, forced to confront her spiritual nakedness? Why does Ambrose stand aside and let it happen? Why did God let the devil torment Job? Not that Lucifer makes an appearance in this novel. Angels may still be angels, but Purcell replaces the traditional devil with a more complex catalogue of human evils, of which self- delusion tops the list. Her version of the path to heaven is a ruthlessly modern one of independence and individuality, a process not of martyrdom but of letting go: \"The span of human life is preparation for contented . . . solitude; bliss is not permanent togetherness but . . . eternal self-sufficiency.\" I now have a much better understanding of what Purcell was working towards in Love, Like, Hate, Adore, with its curious stand-alone heroine hampered in her development by the strings of love and the angelic no-obligation support offered her by a most unlikely man. Purcell is now working on her eighth novel, The Wedding Feast . No doubt she will continue to surprise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
