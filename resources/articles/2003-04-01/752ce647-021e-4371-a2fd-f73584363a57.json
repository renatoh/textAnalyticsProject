The answer to that is that Dubbya can bet his bottom greenback that Gerry won't. In fact the only thing the President can be certain of during his 24-hour visit to Northern Ireland is that Adams will most definitely turn up for the plenary session with Bush, Blair and Ahern on Tuesday. The problem for Gerry and Sinn Fein is that this time the cameras will be out in force. Last month the Sinn Fein President got lucky. When Adams arrived late for the hooley in the Oval Office on St Patrick's Day the photographers had gone, thus sparing him the embarrassment of a handshake with the commander-in-chief of the American forces currently pulverising Iraq. Initially, the Irish peace movement was supine in the face of this hypocritical scenario, failing to call on Adams specifically to pull out of the Paddy's Day shindig in protest over the war. The peace movement appeared to change its tune this weekend, however, with its Derry branch calling on both the SDLP and Sinn Fein to boycott the Tuesday photo opportunity with Bush. Both parties are unlikely to do so. Instead those outside looking in at Hillsborough will be the usual ragged army of far left groups of both the Tank and Trot variety. Say what you will about the Socialist Workers, Socialist Party, Workers Party, IRSP, Communists as well as the Greens (and I believe since the Bosnian war onwards they have been wrong), they have at least been consistent in their hostility to America. Just last weekend Adams was declaring his outright opposition to the assault on Saddam's regime. But interestingly his keynote Ard Fheis speech was not laced with anti-American rhetoric or leftist denunciations of neo-imperialism. Instead Adams launched into a 'I-believe-the-children-are-our-future' ramble with the Sinn Fein leader noting that a small segment of the money being spent to wage war on Iraq could lift millions of Third World children out of poverty. At the same Ard Fheis Ogra Sinn Fein plastered the walls of the RDS canteen with anti-war posters depicting Bush and Blair's assault on Iraq as a Hollywood movie, a take on the last Star Wars film, with the British and American leaders leading an attack of the Clones. Will Ogra Sinn Fein now come out in force to protest at the gates of Hillsborough Castle on Tuesday, even if their party leaders are inside pressing the flesh with the two men heading up the war to topple Saddam? Moreover, where does all this leave the radical chic that has latched onto Sinn Fein since the peace process and the IRA cease-fires? The party has been doing rather well in university campuses throughout Ireland, recruiting students with their blend of hard-line nationalism and far-left politics, encapsulated in their poster depicting Che Guevara and Bobby Sands. At Queens University Belfast, for instance, Sinn Fein is among the two largest political associations, the other being the DUP. In the north the party will continue to attract sullen, vengeful and triumphalist young nationalists in Northern Ireland who see Sinn Fein as a badge of ethnic identity, as well as a two-fingered gesture to the Prods and the 'Orangies'. But SF's Janus-like stance on Bush and the US administration must surely cause them problems in the long run among the young radicals it is wooing in the Republic. Republican realpolitik dictates that while Gerry can fly to Havana and hug as many trees as he pleases in the end he will always opt for America. Castro might be cuddly but the pro-death penalty-for-cop-killers Peter King and his chums in corporate America can deliver far more in terms of finance and influence than the Cuban dictator could ever offer. Ps: for the third weekend in a row the Sunday World has been subject of a loyalist boycott in Protestant areas of Northern Ireland. Far from being a peaceful campaign shopkeepers have been threatened and van drivers told to stay away from loyalist redoubts - 'or else'. The 'or else' being the violent wrath of the local UDA. The World 's northern editor, Jim McDowell, and his staff have stood courageously against this assault on free speech, an attack that threatens the freedoms of every citizen living in the north. To borrow a phrase from the loyalists, McDowell and his team's only crime has been loyalty to the truth. One hopes therefore that Tony O'Reilly and his board stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their northern journalists in the face of this fascism and resist the obsequious advice of other 'commentators' who are urging the management to cut a deal with the Loyalist Commission, thus compromising the paper's ability to tell the truth about drug dealing, racketeering, prostitution and sectarian murder. \u00b7 Observer readers can do their bit for the embattled Sunday World staff by calling their Belfast office on 02890 238118 and offering their support. henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
