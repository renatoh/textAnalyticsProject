Perhaps something of Bradbury's gold medal-winning sheen rubbed off on his fellow Australian when they met at the weekend. Whatever it was, Webber's performance far exceeded the expectations of the team's owner Paul Stoddart, whose ambition for the season had been to gain a single point. Webber topped that with the two he earned in Melbourne which were also Minardi's first points for three years. The Australian driver took full advantage of the first-corner pile-up that put eight of his rivals, including Britain's Allan McNish and Jenson Button, out of the race. \"When I saw the carnage I thought first of all 'I hope everybody is all right' and then 'We could do all right out of this',\" said Webber. \"I've been in this game long enough to know anything can happen, and it usually does. I feel like I have won the race. I just don't want to wake up in the morning and find it didn't happen.\" He drove with great verve on his first outing in the Minardi-Asiatech, but few formula one newcomers have enjoyed so little traffic in their first race at this level, with only eight of the 22 starters managing to finish. During his refuelling stop on lap 36 of the 58-lap race, Webber's car was stationary for no less than 34.9sec for a fuel top-up which would normally have taken about 10sec. The flap that covers the tank nozzle failed to flip up automatically as the Minardi braked to a standstill and eventually had to be prised open with a screwdriver. Normally such an extended stop would have lost a driver up to half a dozen places, but Webber went in and came out lying fifth. This rarely happens to formula one tailenders such as Minardi, whose 17-year grand prix history has been marked by cheerful endeavour rather than achievement. Founded by the entrepreneur Giancarlo Minardi in 1985, the team have retained his name despite being sold first to his fellow Italian Gabriele Rumi and then last year to Stoddart, an Australian aviation dealer, who saved them from extinction. With a budget of about \u00a330m, Minardi operate on a subsistence level compared with the top teams such as Ferrari and McLaren, who spend about \u00a380m each year. With the team's other driver, the Malaysian Alex Yoong, finishing seventh, Stoddart was elated but he will know such a result is unlikely to be repeated in anything less than similarly freakish circumstances. For Webber it was the realisation of a dream to follow in the tyre tracks of Australia's great formula one drivers and it gave him great satisfaction that Sir Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966, was there to see him take the chequered flag. At Jaguar there was a similar feeling of relief after Eddie Irvine steered the dismally uncompetitive R3 from 19th on the grid to fourth place at the finish. Jaguar had arrived in Australia with high hopes that the 2002 season would deliver a significant upturn, but the new car is so slow that they are even considering reverting to an updated version of last year's R2B machine in future races. \"The car was extremely difficult to drive and this doesn't change the fact that we have an enormous amount of work ahead of us,\" said Irvine. \"There cannot be any illusions about how we got this result.\" Now the focus switches to the Malaysian grand prix a week on Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, where Ferrari may give their new car, the F2002, its first outing despite Michael Schumacher's opening victory in last year's model. They will make that decision this weekend. The team's sporting director Jean Todt said: \"We will test the new car at Mugello until Saturday and then decide. We would have no problem getting the car to the race.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
