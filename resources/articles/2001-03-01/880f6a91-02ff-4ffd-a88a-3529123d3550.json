The unnamed man was detained by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Banbridge, County Down, just hours after the department confirmed Northern Ireland's first outbreak of the disease in south Armagh. One livestock importer at the centre of the emergency comes from Banbridge, but it was not clear whether he was the man detained. It was the livestock importer who transported nearly 300 sheep into Northern Ireland from a market in Carlisle which is suspected of being contaminated. The sheep were licensed for slaughter but ended up on the farm in Meigh, south Armagh, where only a consignment of the flock were slaughtered and incinerated. However, a majority of the sheep are believed to have been moved on into the Republic of Ireland and a frantic search is under way to try to trace them. Irish agriculture department officials are investigating suspicions that fraud was involved in the movement of a consignment of 248 lambs. The alarm was raised in Northern Ireland yesterday at the farm in Meigh, on the Irish border, after 21 sheep were discovered with symptoms of the disease. In the Republic of Ireland, the suspected lambs were delivered to the Kepak meat plant, at Athleague, county Roscommon - one of the Irish republic's biggest sheep and meat processing factories - last Tuesday, and were slaughtered immediately. They were delivered in the name of a Roscommon sheep farmer but subsequent investigations by the department have established that the animals did not belong to the man whose name was used. The disease has not been in Ireland for 60 years. In total, five more outbreaks were confirmed at farms today to take the total number of cases to 31. Scotland also recorded its first outbreak at two farms in Dumfries. Both Scottish outbreaks were traced to animal movements from England including from Longtown market, Cumbria, which is known to have been a contact point for the virus. New cases were also confirmed in Longtown and Penrith, Cumbria. In Britain, two more cases were expected to be confirmed later today, including two in Carlisle and one in County Durham, the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore said. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, this morning briefed cabinet colleagues on the crisis as preparations continued to allow some animals from uninfected areas to be sent for slaughter despite the ban on moving livestock. The National Farmers' Union, which welcomed the plans, said the foot-and-mouth crisis would cost Britain's farming and food industry \u00a3775 million unless it was not brought under control within three months. There were also fears that dwindling supplies of home-reared meat could soon run out as prices for cuts of beef, lamb and pork looked set to soar. The total number of animals slaughtered or due to be destroyed in Britain is believed to stand at 11,000, with 102 farms around the country under restrictions. Next week's Crufts dog show, due to be held at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, was cancelled to the public. Meanwhile, John Edmonds, general secretary of the giant GMB union, warned of a \"jobs epidemic\" unless the foot-and-mouth crisis was stopped soon. More than 1,000 employees at meat processing plants and other factories have now been laid-off or are on short-time working, he said, while up to 20,000 workers in the slaughter industry and 40,000 in the bacon and ham processing sector faced an uncertain future if the crisis continues. A compensation package for farmers of \u00a3170m has been announced by the government. Meanwhile, a major supermarket chain confirmed today one of its largest northern stores had run out of pork and lamb as the foot-and-mouth crisis deepened. ASDA, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire ran out despite the big supermarkets expressing confidence earlier in the week that shoppers would not be hit. A spokeswoman for Asda said: \"We still have plenty of meat on the shelves but our hypermarket in Wakefield has run out of pork and lamb.\" Almost all National Trust sites, including countryside, houses, gardens and parks, will close today as part of efforts to contain the disease. And supplies of disinfectant used to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth are reportedly running critically low in some parts of the country. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, and the Archbishop of York, Dr David Hope, asked for prayers to be said in churches across Britain on Sunday.
