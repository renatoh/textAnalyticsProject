The music is less pretentious, and sometimes boldly projected. The triptych of Dilok, Delal and Kulamen Dilan combines percussion with various reed instruments and derives its internal processes from Arabic music, while the source for Keroiylu is Azerbaijani folk music. Two other tracks, Runnin' Wild and Moon's Goin' Down, are instrumental solos inflected with quarter tones that are very well negotiated by the oboist Christopher Redgate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
