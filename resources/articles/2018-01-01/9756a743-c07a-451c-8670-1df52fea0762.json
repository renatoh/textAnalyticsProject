When it was first published in 2003, the book was promoted as a glimpse into Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Author Mark Haddon later disavowed the connection, perhaps because so many people with Asperger\u2019s objected to the portrayal of Christopher Boone. Asperger\u2019s isn\u2019t mentioned in the novel itself: Christopher says he has \u201csome behavioural difficulties\u201d. But his character adheres to some common ideas about neuratypical people that are espoused in movies such as Rain Man: he has unusual mental abilities (he can instantly count a herd of cows outside a train window, and has a precocious mathematical ability) and he\u2019s unsettlingly devoid of empathy for other people. The National Theatre\u2019s stage adaptation is the Melbourne Theatre Company\u2019s headline act for 2018. A lauded production that began in London\u2019s Cottesloe Theatre and ended up playing seasons in the West End and Broadway, it has been brought to Melbourne by the MTC and Arts Centre Melbourne. A much beloved bestselling book, adapted for the stage by a remarkable contemporary playwright for the National Theatre. What could possibly go wrong? As far as the rapturous opening night audience was concerned, not much. It was a hit before it even opened, with the entire season sold out. The production is an artfully conceived and skilfully manifested adaptation, which remains, as playwright Simon Stephens himself says, \u201cloyal\u201d to the book. This means that narrative and dialogue have been imported wholesale and given theatrical dress-ups. There\u2019s a strong current of sentimentality that makes this very much a story for those on the outside looking in, which perhaps has been exaggerated by the crudities of adaptation to the stage. Like the book, the production is ingeniously conceived. The voice of Haddon\u2019s narrator is vivid and intriguing, and the images interspersing the text have been translated by designers Bunny Christie (set), Paule Constable (lighting) and Finn Ross (video) into visual spectacle, with a set that combines projections, drawings and boxes that can be repurposed as different objects. The cast consists of the four major characters, Christopher himself (Joshua Jenkins), his father Ed (David Michaels), his mother Judy (Emma Beattie) and his teacher Siobhan (Julie Hale), with all other characters played by the remaining six cast members. Marianne Elliott (also the director of the hit National Theatre show War Horse) creates a stylised performance that segues into physical theatre or dance, choreographed by Frantic Assembly\u2019s Scott Graham and Steve Hoggett. Actors become props \u2013 doors, for instance \u2013 in ways that irresistibly recalled theatre in education shows I saw in the 1990s. There\u2019s no denying it\u2019s well done, but as a trope it also strikes me as arch, contributing to a cutely self-conscious charm that begins to grate early on. This stylisation creates a disconnect that exposes the emotional holes in the story. While the crude characterisations work fine for the minor characters, such as headmistress Mrs Gascoyne (Amanda Posener), it creates a dilemma with the major characters around Christopher. The audience is supposed to empathise with his parents, Ed and Judy, who both struggle with the challenges of dealing with Christopher. Yet they are seldom more than speculative sketches, heavily relying on cliche: the inarticulate father struggling with his own emotional problems; the mother who runs off with her dodgy lover, unable to cope with her son. Presumably the characters that surround Christopher Boone are seen through his subjectivity. As he\u2019s unable to perceive them except as gross caricatures, that is what they become: ciphers who represent various behavioural mysteries. This means the emotional arc of the story is forced to rely on a heavy dose of sentimentality to power it past its more questionable aspects. We discover some deeply disturbing things about Ed, for instance, which are glossed over with a moment of shameless audience-pleasing awwwww that substitutes for any actual resolution. Emotional verity is mostly replaced by spectacle, and this is definitely a very pretty show. The design is at its most powerful when it conveys the panic of information overload when, for instance, Christopher travels through the London Underground. But even the best effects dull with repetition, and repetition is built into the dramaturgy in ways that don\u2019t enhance it. What interested me most about the production was its ingenious problem solving, but that\u2019s hardly ballast for an entire evening. I couldn\u2019t help wondering what it might have been like had Simon Stephens been less loyal to the novel: the adaptation is effectively an animated book, rather than a translation into theatre, and so plays heavily towards audience expectations rather than surprise. But perhaps a more radical adaptation might have alienated Haddon\u2019s fanbase. \u2022 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is on at the Arts Centre Melbourne until 25 February 2018"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
