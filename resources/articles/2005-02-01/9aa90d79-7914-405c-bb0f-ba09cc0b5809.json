I declare the resignation of the government that I had the honour to head. May God preserve Lebanon,\" Mr Karami said. The resignation was a huge victory for the opposition and the most dramatic moment yet in the series of protests and political manoeuvres that have shaken Lebanon and its Syrian-backed government since the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. Mr Karami's cabinet will continue as a caretaker government. The next step is for the president to appoint a prime minister after consulting with members of parliament. The new prime minister will then consult parliamentary blocs to form a cabinet that must withstand a parliamentary vote of confidence. Jubilant demonstrators immediately called for the country's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, to step down next, shouting \"Lahoud, your turn is coming\", \"Syria Out\" and \"freedom, sovereignty, independence\". Mr Lahoud's six-year term was renewed in September by parliament, under apparent Syrian pressure, in defiance of a UN resolution. That resolution demanded Lebanon hold presidential elections, Syrian troops pull out of Lebanon and Syria stop interfering in Lebanese affairs. \"The battle is not over. It is just beginning. We want to know who killed prime minister Hariri,\" opposition legislator Faris Saeed said, addressing the crowd. The crowd responded: \"Syria, Syria.\" Many in Lebanon accuse Syria and Mr Karami's government of being behind Hariri's assassination, pressing hard in the two weeks since his death for the government to resign and for Syria to withdraw its troops, said to number 15,000, from in Lebanon. Cheering broke out among the more than 25,000 demonstrators who had gathered at nearby Martyrs' Square when they heard the announcement by Mr Karami, broadcast by loudspeakers. Throughout the day, the protesters were handing red roses to soldiers and police. Mr Karami announced the decision during a parliamentary debate called to discuss Hariri's February 14 assassination. Earlier today, he had asked the legislature to renew its confidence in his cabinet, which took power in October after Hariri's resignation amid a dispute with Syria. Led by banking and business associations, much of Lebanon also observed a one-day strike in memory of Mr Hariri today, allowing lawyers in black robes and doctors in white gowns to join the demonstration. Protesters also prayed in front of candles at Hariri's flower-covered grave, which lies at the edge of the square. The interior minister, Suleiman Franjieh, had banned all protests today on grounds of \"supreme national interests\". The security forces cordoned off Martyr's Square early in the morning, but they made no serious effort to disperse the demonstrators, many of whom had slept in the square. Some soldiers and police even sympathised with the protesters, and were seen advising newcomers on how to evade the cordon. During the parliamentary session, legislators stopped their debate and stood for a minute's silence at 12:55 (1055GMT), the time Hariri died two weeks ago. Hariri's sister, MP Bahiya Hariri, addressed the parliament in black and called on the government to resign. \"All the Lebanese want to know their enemy, the enemy of Lebanon who killed the martyr Rafik Hariri, those who took the decision, planned and executed it, those who ignored and prevented the truth from coming out,\" Bahiya Hariri said. Damascus said last week that it would redeploy its troops to eastern Lebanon, closer to its border, but that they would not leave the country. By today, there was no sign of the redeployment having begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
