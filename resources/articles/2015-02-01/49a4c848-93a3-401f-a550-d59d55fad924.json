They were still reading from the old talking points \u2013 the ones the government has been using to try to drive a statutory office holder out of her job, the ones the prime minister, Tony Abbott, still seemed to be using during question time a few hours later. Having repeatedly interjected as Labor senator Penny Wong led Triggs through a 3 February meeting at which Triggs said the secretary of the attorney general\u2019s department, Chris Moraitis, asked her to resign at the request of George Brandis and offered her \u201cother work with the government\u201d, O\u2019Sullivan joked to committee chairman Macdonald, \u201cI thought you might like to hear a man\u2019s voice.\u201d They might have done better to listen to the women, because by Triggs\u2019s account Moraitis, at the request of Brandis, might have come close to committing an offence. The criminal code says it is an offence to offer \u201ca benefit, or the promise of the provision of a benefit \u2026 with the intention of influencing a public official\u201d. According to Triggs, Moraitis asked for her resignation, on behalf of Brandis, and offered her \u201cother work with the government\u201d. She said there was no doubt the resignation request and the work offer \u201cwere linked\u201d and she considered the proposal \u201cdisgraceful\u201d because the Human Rights Commission is an independent statutory authority. Asked whether she thought it was an inducement, she said, \u201cI prefer not to use that term, especially since it is a term of legal art.\u201d Later in the committee hearing Moraitis offered a slightly different account. He said he had, at Brandis\u2019s request, told Triggs she had lost the confidence of the government, and of Brandis himself. He denied he had used the word resignation, but he agreed he had offered her another, specific \u201csenior legal role\u201d and that accepting that role would have meant she would have had to leave the human rights commission, that \u201cone would follow from the other\u201d. Brandis confirmed he believed Triggs had \u201cfatally compromised\u201d the impartiality of the commission with the \u201cinconsistent and evasive\u201d evidence she had given late last year about the timing of the commission\u2019s children in detention inquiry. \u201cMy confidence in her partiality collapsed,\u201d he said. All this incendiary evidence was given as Brandis, Moraitis and Triggs sat almost side by side before the committee, each looking as though they would prefer to be almost anywhere else. Brandis was specific in his criticism, saying he had high regard for Triggs personally and professionally, and pointing out it had always been the government\u2019s intention to release children from detention once it had \u201cstopped the boats\u201d. But Abbott was broader during question time, raising the timing of the decision to launch the children in detention report and Triggs\u2019s recommendation that a convicted murderer be awarded compensation (a reference to Triggs\u2019s view on a murderer who had been held in detention by subsequent governments after he had served his prison term for the crime). \u201cObviously we question the competence and judgment of the president of the Human Rights Commission,\u201d he said. O\u2019Sullivan and Macdonald preferred broad-ranging dismissiveness. Macdonald confirmed he had not read the commission\u2019s children in detention report \u2013 the subject of the entire controversy between the commission and the Abbott government \u2013 because he was sure it was biased. O\u2019Sullivan made a theatrical show of taking Triggs through her evidence of last year with a red Texta, asking which bits he might be able to cross out. Both seemed unconcerned about the serious issues at hand, other than their own concerns about alleged bias \u2013 such as the standing of the statutory agency that oversees Australia\u2019s human rights performance, whether anything improper had been done at the request of the top law officer in the land, and whether a lawyer of 46 years\u2019 standing who holds a five-year statutory appointment could be hounded out of office. When Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked later whether O\u2019Sullivan might want to retract his statement about Macdonald needing to hear from a man, Macdonald said he assumed she was joking. But it seems the government will continue to hear from one woman, no matter how much it would prefer not to. Triggs is adamant she isn\u2019t going anywhere, that despite the \u201cbuilding crescendo\u201d of criticism from the government and from some newspapers, resignation would mean \u201cgiving in to the very pressure that [her] position was designed to stop\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
