The first three months of the year looked as though circulation was going through the floor, but the market has stabilised since then. This is due in part to promotional activity. Yet there is also a greater sense of underlying steadiness in the ABC figures. Year-on-year, the total newspaper market is 3.2% down (much better than the scary -4.2% seen in March); month-on-month, the figure is a small 0.8% down. The quality daily market is the prime example of this sense of steadiness. Yes, there was the normal range of added-value promotions. Yes, bulk sales levels have been tweaked a bit. Yes, Bono's editorship of the Independent in mid-May added a bit of celebrity glitz and a 30% sales uplift for one day: it also sparked a new game to suggest rock-star editors for other newspapers (Coldplay for the Guardian? James Blunt for the Times? Brian Ferry for the Telegraph? Cliff Richard for the Mail?). Yet strip out all this silly fun and the Guardian has clearly settled down after its format change. Now it is back to grinding old business as usual, and May sees the Telegraph suffering, as the Times, the Independent and the Guardian all eat into its sales equally. The quality Sunday sector is more volatile. May was not good for either the Observer or the Independent on Sunday, both of which have not yet settled down after their format changes. Express Newspapers has had a better May, across both the Star and the Express, and on both weekdays and Sunday. Yet behind all these short-term trends, there lurk a number of massive issues related to cover price. Two intriguing things are happening out in the provinces. First, north of the border, the 14-month old price war continues with the cut-price Sun closing slowly but remorselessly on the Daily Record. A year ago the gap was more than 80,000 copies. In the April ABCs, this had dropped to 24,000 copies. In May, the gap is only 12,000 copies with the Sun claiming that for the last week of May it consistently outsold the Record for a full week by a 7,000 copy margin. The next question is what is the Sun going to do once it has fully overhauled its competitor? Second, all eyes are on Manchester where the Manchester Evening News (MEN) has dropped its late afternoon \"lite\" edition to give away 50,000 copies of the \"full-fat\" newspaper in the city centre at the same time as it is being sold at 35p in the suburbs. This extremely risky experiment has implications for national newspapers as well as for regionals like the MEN, as it all relates to the question of how to get print publications into the hands of younger, more upmarket consumers who have never bought into the newspaper-buying habit. Free distribution is one route, but what the MEN is effectively testing is a radical, variable pricing model, although one of the \"prices\" is zero. Variable pricing is what both the Telegraph and the Times have been using with their pre-paid subscriptions, but the MEN is taking things on to a new level and the implications of what it is doing are immensely significant. The issue of price leads us back to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) review of the press supply chain that has been dominating the minds of publishing executives over the past few days. The OFT believes that competition should be introduced into the current complicated, anti-competitive, but efficient newspaper distribution process. It also believes that competition in distribution will bring lower consumer cover prices. Add to all these things the fact that Rupert Murdoch believes that UK newspaper cover prices have gone too high and price is firmly back at the top of the newspaper industry agenda as one of its biggest and most complex issues. Having Bono as your editor may be fun, but knowing at what price to sell your newspaper is what is really going to shape the ABC figures in the longterm. %#183; Jim Bilton is managing partner of Wessenden Marketing, an independent media research firm. www.wessenden.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
