Witty, erudite and only occasionally pissed, especially on the posh people's paper. What then are we to make of weekend exchanges between august Times columnists Giles Coren and Janice Turner, drawing in their colleagues Hugo Rifkind and Caitlin Moran? Elevated, it was not: Turner, who tweets for some reason under the pseudonym Victoria Peckham, described Coren, a chap whose potty mouth is exceeded only by his self-regard, as Times Wanker of the Week. This prompted Coren, just back from a long lunch on holiday in France, as befits a restaurant critic, to call Peckham \u2013 sensitive readers look away now \u2013 \"a sour old bag of cunt cheese\" before he realised who she was, at which point he added: \"What the fuck is your problem?\" An apology of sorts, followed. \"Sorry everyone. Am just back from lunch, drunk ... am cunt.\" So true, or as Rifkind puts it: \"Some days writing feels like shitting a breeze block.\" What oft was thought and ne'er so well expressed. \u2712Coren, of course, is the chap who gained a niche in the nation's hearts with a memo to Times subeditors two years ago in which he deployed his verbal skills to expostulate following the removal of an indefinite article from his copy, and earlier this year complained on Twitter about his neighbour's present of a drumkit to his son. Coren's also not having a very good holiday as his latest dispatch concerns pranging his car. What a pity Twitter's not behind a paywall. \u2712It is scarcely the acme of British diplomacy, but the question of who is to be the next ambassador to the Holy See in Rome is exercising Catholics. Hitherto it's been a bit of a backwater, with our plenipotentiaries having to make do without even a secretary and presumably riding their bike round to St Peter's. The present incumbent is Francis Campbell \u2013 the first Catholic to hold the post since the Reformation \u2013 who has been rather a success. But he's moving on after the Pope's visit to Britain, and the list of potential successors is spiralling ever upwards. They're all Tories, too. First was Ann Widdecombe, but she was too busy preparing for Strictly Come Dancing, so the Tablet magazine has come up with some other names, including Lord Deben, the little fellow formerly known as John Selwyn Gummer \u2013 for some reason, Anglican apostates are popular candidates \u2013 the Marquess of Lothian, the folksinging former Tory minister Michael Ancram, all-purpose panjandrum Lord Patten, and, intriguingly, ex-Telegraph editor Charles Moore. He's very grand himself of course, and another convert. At least he's not likely to be caught twittering \u2013 or not quite like Coren, anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
