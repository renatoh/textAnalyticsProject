Thank you for rising to the challenge. The response was impressive, and your mastery of digital technology even more so. We received more than 150 emails and letters from as far apart as R\u00bfunion in the southern Indian ocean to Iqaluit in northern Canada; from Osaka, Japan, to the dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. Indeed, it was Alan Wicks's striking photo of himself, dressed all in white beside a white tent on those dazzling white sands that made its way into the booklet called The Guardian: Past And Present, which was prepared specially for The Newsroom's opening. The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand produced the most reader responses, but the largest group to take up the challenge were teachers, many working in countries and cultures that could not be further from their homes. Jennifer Wade sent a photo of herself reading the Guardian Weekly as she waited in a long queue to use a solar-powered phone in Ondangwa, Namibia. In a wry accompanying note she says: \"I didn't intend to be an English teacher this long. After a year of teaching in Tanzania I had hoped to return to the UK and find work more related to my geography degree. \"No chance! My mistake had been not to take the Guardian Weekly. A year out of touch with British news and I was in no fit state to answer interview questions regarding current affairs. \"So I went abroad again. This time to Namibia and this time with the Guardian Weekly. There's no substitute for the breadth of news coverage and the analysis contained within those nice crisp pages. And the Learning English supplement is a gift. I won't leave home without the Guardian Weekly again!\" Margareta Langbacka-Walker is a VSO teacher in Yulin, in the Guanxi province of southern China. She sent a couple of photos of her students all reading the Weekly during a culture class, where, she says, \"it provides endless information in a poor college without many resources\". She adds: \"On Friday evenings students run an English Cafe, and eventually the papers end up there, to the delight of many male students interested in football and other sports. Many teachers and other staff ask me to lend them a paper to read: it makes a change from old copies of the China Daily in our library.\" Those working for development and relief agencies also responded well to the challenge. Isabel Phillips, who trains Bosnians in organisational, communication and conflict resolution skills for a German NGO, writes: \"Each week I want to pick up the threads of stories told the previous week and follow them through. Told with humour and compassion, they should allow a concise mental summary of events around the world. If the post arrives weeks late, the paper should still be interesting. \"I thought I was never going to find a newspaper which fulfilled these criteria. Then I found the Guardian Weekly.\" And Brian Sims writes from Bolivia that, while working on a conservation project in the Andes to save the town of Arque from floods caused by the destruction of protective vegetation, \"It is illuminating to reflect on the strutting and posturing of our leaders. The Guardian Weekly gives that window on the world and furnishes the hope that sanity could one day reign to save our ravaged planet\". One element of the challenge was to be photographed reading the Weekly in an exotic location. And there were plenty of readers who knew just the spot - or the occasion. David Leeks chose his wedding as the perfect moment to be pictured reading the paper. It was no ordinary ceremony. According to Javanese custom, he and his bride Winda had to undertake three costume and make-up changes at a day-long wedding attended by 1,000 guests in tropical heat. He writes: \"The long hours and interminable handshakes were made more bearable by one of our favourite pastimes . . . the Guardian crosswords!\" Kayaks and the Weekly seem to go together: Ian Walton is kitted up against the cold in Prince William Sound, Alaska, as he reads his paper; Bill Blann, drifting on the Yukon in Canada, admits to taking it on the river every year; and Rachel Leigh sends a picture of herself reading the paper on the shore of Kootenay lake, British Columbia - next to her kayak. Statues and large sculptures also proved irresistible backdrops for some readers, including two Claes Oldenburgs: Jim Grebe, who shares many respondents' pleasure at Nancy Banks-Smith's writing, appears to have been narrowly missed by a Giant Shuttlecock in Kansas City, Missouri. Jenny Jantz found the most exotic man-made backdrop - standing next to a giant totem pole in northern British Columbia. She lives in Prince Rupert, a small fishing and pulp mill town close to the Alaskan panhandle, and reads the Weekly for its balanced reports of world events. \"The area has much to offer, but one of the detriments is that world news is dominated by the American media,\" she says. New Zealand yielded some of the most evocative pictures, but I may be biased, having spent six happy years there. Heather Mackintosh got as close as she dared to a bull seal on the coast near New Plymouth, while Jude Rogers, who once tried cancelling her subscription to save money (\"but the withdrawal symptoms were worse than the financial cost\"), found a delightful spot to read the Weekly at Kura Tawhiti, in the mountains an hour's drive west of Christchurch. Ngaere Campbell, who lives at Karuna Falls in the Coromandel peninsula, sent a picture of herself reading the paper in an open-air bath over an open fire. \"If it gets too hot or exciting, I turn on the hose,\" she says. George Rose, who sent a veritable essay and a CD-Rom full of images from his hideaway in the Marlborough Sounds, writes: \"In praise of the GW I would say that the articles are articulate and witty. Complex issues are always well laid out such that I . . . can easily understand and enjoy them.\" Contented retirement seems to be the thread running through several of the Australian responses. Keith Bushnell, who says that he and the Weekly have travelled with each other for decades (\"We didn't agree 100% of the time, but we're still together\"), looks out across the Southern ocean from his home on Kangaroo island, off the South Australian coast. Australia is a big and remote continent. David Ogilvie sent a picture of himself among a group of Aborigines preparing for a ceremonial dance in the empty Northern Territory, where his job is to manage Warlukurlangu Artists, whose income is so vital to supporting their community. Meanwhile Jean Williams and her partner Mick spend part of their year teaching the children of crayfishers on a tiny island in the Houtman-Abrolhos group off Western Australia, where \"one of the highlights of the week is receiving the Guardian Weekly\". The most enthusiastic contribution came from Jessica Magnus: \"When I moved from Berlin to Sydney last year,\" she writes, \"I not only discovered the new world, but also, as far as I consider, one of the world's best newspapers, the Guardian Weekly . . . It keeps me company on the bus and train rides through Sydney's insane traffic, shortens the time in the waiting queue at the post office, and makes a sunny afternoon at Bondi beach complete.\" These are just a few of a string of fascinating narratives that left me amazed, amused and downright admiring of the adventurousness of our readers. But all of you - whether, like John Buddenhagen, you're watching an iguana in the Galapagos islands, or, like Anthony Furness, using the paper to ward off an aggressive arctic tern on F\u00bfr\u00bf - share a love for the Guardian Weekly, its writing and its independent perspective on events that makes me, as its editor, both humble and grateful for your continuing loyalty. Those whose pictures appear on these pages will receive a free year's subscription to the Guardian Weekly.
