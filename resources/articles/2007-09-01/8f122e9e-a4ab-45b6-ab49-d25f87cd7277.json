Some seasons ago after watching my Luton Town side slip to defeat I claimed to the then FA director of football that we were the better team. We were quicker, our passing was easier on the eye and we had more penetration, width and depth. \"But you lost, didn't you?\" he replied. The result is key. Arsenal's ascendancy on Saturday stemmed from their quicker use of an early pass and the speed with which they switched the ball from one side of the field to the other with a sequence of short, fast passes. It was not only the twinkling Cesc F\u00e1bregas who set the tone. Mathieu Flamini gave excellent close support and Ga\u00ebl Clichy was a model of excellence on Arsenal's left, moving forward with great energy, speed and craft. With Emmanuel Adebayor facing up cleverly to midfield prompting, the ball was played back with one touch to give Alexander Hleb, F\u00e1bregas, Flamini and, later, Tomas Rosicky extra time to assess and move another quick ball on. By comparison, Martin Jol's team were spread too easily. The distances between the middle and the front were too great. When they achieved possession at the back, both Tom Huddlestone and Jermaine Jenas had been forced to defend and were too deep. This had the effect of encouraging a quicker ball to the front pair but the supporting players had too much ground to cover to link the play. Indeed, neither Huddlestone nor Jenas appeared to have the pace to get beyond midfield opponents with the ball or to cover the ground to support the longer forward ball, which left Spurs' front line virtually cut off. Class midfielders run on to open up back fours or have pace and movement to go past their immediate opponent, as F\u00e1bregas did so often (see diagram), and confront central defenders. Here, F\u00e1bregas and the much improved Flamini scored heavily where Tottenham were becalmed. Neither Huddlestone nor Jenas got close enough to their front men in support, leaving Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane isolated whenever the ball was flung forward. With Steed Malbranque and Gareth Bale working hard to cover the full-backs Pascal Chimbonda and Lee Young-pyo, Spurs' strike force was nullified. Tottenham will have to be bolder and call opponents' bluff. If Huddlestone holds, Jenas must try to get closer to his forwards. The brilliant but occasionally erratic Gilberto Silva was sometimes caught square to present Tottenham with chances here, but Huddlestone and Jenas between them were never close enough to the front men to be a threat. Indeed, you could count on the fingers of one hand the efforts at goal mustered by Tottenham's midfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
