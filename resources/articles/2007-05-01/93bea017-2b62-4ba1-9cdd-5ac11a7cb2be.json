Rihanna ft. Jay-Z, Umbrella While this Bajan spokesmodel's first two hits - 'Pon De Replay', and the one with a bit of 'Tainted Love' in it - did the jobs required of them but nothing more, 'Umbrella' is far more than just a functional accoutrement. Mentor Jay-Z's seemingly lackadaisical intro sets the scene by smuggling in a great CEO-style simile about rain 'coming down like the Dow Jones'. And just as the sublimely improper concept of Rihanna as a kind of human nest-egg - someone he has put away for a rainy day - starts to take shape. that nest-egg hatches in a gloriously messy welter of Eurovision-style vocal echo and Old School hip-hop rhythm-track. Ben Thompson 2. Carbon/Silicon, Why Do Men Fight? Before the Clash and Generation X, way before Big Audio Dynamite and Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Mick Jones and Tony James were in a band called the London SS. Formed in March 1975, they split in January 1976 without playing a single show. Thirty-one years later, and Jones and James have put out their first record together. 'Why Do Men Fight?', the second track from Carbon/Silicon's first four-track EP, is two marching, charging chords and a set of naive, sweetly sung, anti-war sentiments. The other three tunes on 'The News EP' do similar things. Time has turned Jones and James into a pair of hippies. Weird thing is, it works. Garry Mulholland 3. Guns N' Roses, Chinese Democracy (Internet leak) Chinese Democracy, the endlessly-awaited opus from Guns N' Roses, still doesn't have a confirmed release date. In the meantime, it's sprung more leaks than Tony Blair's government. Another four tracks from the album materialised through the internet this month - albeit (suspiciously) the same ones that have been leaked previously in a slightly different form. Still, the good news is the album is shaping up to be the Forever Changes of heavy rock. The title track is a punk thrash barnstormer replete with Axl Rose's mad dog vocals. When it finally does arrive, Chinese Democracy looks set to live up to its name and stomp all over the opposition. Chris Campion 4. Pase Rock, Lindsay Lohan's Revenge (www.myspace.com/thepaserock) 'Put your panties on!' screams the chorus, followed by further suggestions as to how the Hollywood actress (and keen music fan - well, she turned up at the Coachella festival) might preserve her dignity. Except given that Pase Rock is connected to the filthy Spank Rock, it's no surprise that those suggestions aren't couched in the most polite terms. Nor is the sound of this track demure: the bass enjoys the kind of booty last seen on Rasputia in Eddie Murphy's Norbit, while the electro flourishes make the whole sound curiously Shoreditch. Pase (aka Patrick Johnson) is a member of the Five Deez and Spank's act. Time for more solo outings. Caspar Llewellyn Smith 5. Terra Naomi, Say It's Possible That YouTube, eh? Launching 'bedroom' sensations since 2005. Right now, 2,172,845 people have watched Terra Naomi performing eco-acoustic anthem 'Say It's Possible'. A hefty 11,046 people have filled 1,105 comment pages. Savvily, Naomi has asked her global fan diaspora to submit their own clips, to be edited into a 'proper' video. Over 100 joe-shmoe strummers have taken her literally and covered the song. It's not her best - Naomi has a piano number called 'Vicodin' that is much spikier. But in its mixing of Tori Amos and Joni Mitchell, 'Say It's Possible' marks the arrival of the hottest singer-songwriter since, um, Sandi Thom.
