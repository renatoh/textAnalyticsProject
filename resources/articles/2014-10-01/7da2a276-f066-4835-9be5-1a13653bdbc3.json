Photographs of the site in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero were released on Tuesday after a small group of journalists were taken behind a heavily policed cordon. They show people in white jump suits working at the bottom of the gully reportedly about 10m deep and reachable only with the help of ropes. They appear to be working on the surface and there are no signs of bodies. Milenio newspaper said the area was now peppered with little red flags. The dump lies just outside the small town of Cocula, about 10 miles from the city of Iguala where municipal police and unidentified gunmen attacked the students from a famously radical teacher training college on 26 September. Six people died and dozens of students went missing, many of them after being driven away by police. They were allegedly handed over to Guerreros Unidos, a local drug gang. Jes\u00fas Murillo, the attorney general, last week said the order to pursue the students came directly from the mayor of Iguala who feared the students were planning to disrupt a speech by his wife who has been identified as a key operator for the drug gang. The mayor and his wife are now on the run. Murillo told reporters on Monday that the authorities were led to the dump because of declarations made by four new detainees, taking the total of people arrested in relation to the case to 56. Using characteristically cryptic language, Murillo stressed that the new detainees were the first to have confessed to direct participation in \u201cthe disappearance and the fate of this large group of people\u201d. He did not specify what that fate was, but promised that the authorities were putting all their energy into corroborating whether it was true. The authorities have already dug up at least 38 corpses, many of them badly burned, from another 11 graves on the outskirts of Iguala itself. DNA tests showed they were not the bodies of the students, although doubts about the quality of the samples used mean more tests are under way. The events in Guerrero have laid bare the extent to which local authorities in some parts of Mexico have become intertwined with organised criminal groups, exploding the government\u2019s claims to be bringing Mexico\u2019s eight-year-old drug wars under control. The resulting outrage has triggered near constant protests, particularly in Guerrero and Mexico City. Many of these have been peaceful marches headed by the missing students\u2019 parents, who are mainly poverty stricken farmers. Some demonstrations have turned violent with protesters attacking government buildings. Public anger finally forced Guerrero\u2019s governor, Angel Aguirre, to resign last week. He has been replaced by Rogelio Ortega, a sociologist with a background in Guerrero\u2019s leftist movements. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has responded to the pressure with frequent statements promising his government will find the students and bring those responsible to justice. Manuel Mart\u00ednez, a spokesman for the relatives, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a month now and all we have is bodies and more bodies and so far none of them have been them [the students]. We don\u2019t know what the government is playing at. They must know where they are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
