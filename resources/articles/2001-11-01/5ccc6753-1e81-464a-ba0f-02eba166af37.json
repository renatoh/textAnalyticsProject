Poor economic growth, high unemployment, rising poverty and controversial agricultural reforms have to be dealt with by the former communist and politburo member, and fast. Poland, the largest of the 12 would-be member countries waiting to join, is in danger of failing to make the first enlargement wave. Now Mr Miller has the added headache of a Polish identity crisis to deal with. A new study published earlier this week suggests that Poles are the most pessimistic of all the citizens of candidate countries. The poll, conducted by the European Society for Opinion and Market Research, suggests that the Polish nation feels unwelcome and feels it is viewed as \"second class\" by member states. It has to be said, the Poles are possibly the most image-conscious of any of the candidate countries and the ones most concerned with appearing to be modern. It is no coincidence that they feel a great affinity with the USA and its obsession with branding and \"newness\". It is also no surprise that they are fed up with the Polish stereotype that is like a stuck record: that they are thieves, beggars, and liars. A report I once wrote about an Polish pig farmers' initiative, illustrated with the picture of a fat, satisfied pig, drew cries of criticism from my friends and acquaintances in Warsaw. \"Don't you realise the damage you've done?\" one of them asked. \"Everyone reading that will automatically equate pigs and Poles.\" We argued about it for a while - I suggested that instead the article demonstrated the innovative nature of the Poles. Finally, we agreed to disagree. This view of their sensitivity is confirmed by Daniel Debomy, who headed the EU attitudes survey, which was funded by the European Commission. \"The Poles are worried their image in the rest of Europe is bad ... but they are not anti-European,\" he says. Indeed, support for membership remains relatively high: around 60% of Poles are in favour of accession - this has risen at times to 72% - although 44% feel the EU will gain more from the changes than Poland will. But, in more than any other of the candidate countries, there is a groundswell of opinion that joining the EU will threaten the country's identity. The debate has spread throughout society, so that it is even discussed in artistic circles. Some artists have expressed their worries about opening Polish culture to a world market. Wojciech Siemion, a film actor, wants Polish culture to be given special protection when the country joins. The president of the painters' association, Geno Malkowski, however, argues that joining the EU will be positive for Poland and for other European cultures. \"My belief is that any culture which is cut off from life is dead and will never make its mark in history,\" Mr Malkowski said recently. One leading newspaper editor even tried to launch a congress of intellectuals for the defence of culture, but came under pressure from Leszek Miller's Democratic Left Alliance to \"tone down\" his ideas. Last summer, in an attempt to appeal to the Poles' image consciousness, and to reform false and misplaced ideas about Poland in the rest of Europe, the government launched an $18m dollar publicity campaign. Its ambassador to the EU, Jan Truszcynski, said it was an attempt to tackle an \"uncomfortable situation\" and \"stereotypical fears\" - a reaction to the high level of opposition in other countries towards Poland's EU bid. But, within the country, in both rural and urban areas, it is hard to hide the real enthusiasm. The word \"Euro\" has become a byword for quality and good service: \"Euromarket\", \"Eurocineplex\", \"Eurogas\" and \"Europroduct\" are just a few examples of its use on the road from Lodz to Warsaw. The royal blue of the European flag is the colour scheme chosen by increasing numbers of car dealerships, supermarkets and even restaurants. And the yellow stars do much to brighten up the odd drab hoarding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
