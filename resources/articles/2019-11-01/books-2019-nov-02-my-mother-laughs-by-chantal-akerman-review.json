Which is a very good idea!\u201d she adds, waving her knife in the air. Her mother, Natalia, laughs. Her mother laughs often, Akerman recalls in her memoir, in which the present day seems to be about a year before the film was made. \u201cOften she laughs in the middle of her moans.\u201d \u201cI listen to her laugh,\u201d Akerman writes. \u201cShe laughs over nothing. But this nothing means a lot. She even laughs in the morning sometimes ... I like the sound her laugh makes. She sleeps a lot, but she laughs. She enjoys herself. Then she sleeps.\u201d She laughs and then she\u2019s seized with emotion, \u201cgrabbing\u201d her daughter\u2019s \u201cface and kissing it with an intensity\u201d that makes her turn away. Akerman laughs along because, she writes, otherwise \u201cthis blanket sentimentality threatens to overwhelm us as we don\u2019t know what to do with it, it\u2019s too heavy\u201d. Akerman struggles with the duties of a daughter. In this sense My Mother Laughs shares DNA with Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s A Very Easy Death, or Roland Barthes\u2019s Mourning Diary. But it is much more quotidian than either of those predecessors. You never tell me anything about your life, Natalia complains. You already said twice that you want fromage blanc, the daughter gripes. Akerman\u2019s subject is a relationship that is so fraught with love and respect that it can overspill into frustration and intolerance even as she reminds herself of the precariousness of her mother\u2019s health, to jolt herself into behaving better towards her. The book reads like a \u201csneeze\u201d, says Eileen Myles, who provides a preface to the Silver edition. I would say that it\u2019s more like a sneeze that never arrives, the sort that lingers, unbearably feathering your sinuses, until it clears. Akerman says she experiences the same kind of frustration in writing; it is never the catharsis she wants it to be; she is never happy with the results. \u201cI read through everything I wrote and I feel very disappointed. But what can I do. I wrote it. It\u2019s there.\u201d Jotted down in her mother\u2019s apartment in Brussels, the book is saturated with the intimate space of the home, with overproximity to its subject. Natalia nearly dies once during the course of it, and, we are meant to understand, though it\u2019s never spelled out, she is no longer alive by the time we are reading it. Neither, for that matter, is its author. Akerman suffered from depression, and a year after her mother\u2019s death, she took her own life. This knowledge hangs over the book. Indeed, many will read it for clues to understand that final decision. She describes herself as an \u201cold child\u201d, someone who was \u201cborn old\u201d and \u201cnever became an adult\u201d, who, \u201cif their mother ever died they\u2019d have nowhere left to go\u201d. Perhaps then, she writes, she would give herself permission to die as well. But we must guard against using the book as an elaborate suicide note: it is a work of art as carefully crafted as one of Akerman\u2019s films. The account is sensitively rendered into English by Daniella Shreir (editor of the feminist film magazine Another Gaze), who was eager to preserve the \u201crebelliousness\u201d of the book\u2019s experimental form. Episodes from the past recur; there are tricky twists and turns of perspective; the voice echoes Gertrude Stein in its simplicity, its repetitions, its sparse punctuation, its line breaks. There are photographs scattered throughout, taken both from the family photo album and from Akerman\u2019s films, each a composition in itself. Her films often seem to be a series of living photographs. No Home Movie shows Natalia mostly in moments of stillness, and often through a half-open doorway, as she sits in her favourite armchair, or at the dining room table. As is typical of Akerman\u2019s formally challenging films, the shots are static, and prolonged, an accumulation of time, space and whatever we, the viewers, are projecting on to the scene. We see the director herself in glimpses through half-opened doors, acting indeed like an \u201cold child\u201d, scooping pickles out of a jar, asking to be told a story, slipping off an ottoman. She famously liked to put her camera at her own height, rather than the standard height established by male film-makers. But in No Home Movie, the camera is established at doorknob height \u2013 child height. We regularly see nothing higher up than people\u2019s torsos. Tell me a story, maman. Her mother, both in the film and the book, has anecdotes, but withholds the most important stories \u2013 the ones that would communicate the truth of her experience in Auschwitz, where the rest of her family died. Perhaps this is why there are so many prolonged silences in her daughter\u2019s films. The laugh, too, is a cover; perhaps it is another kind of silence. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
