More than 3,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared during Pinochet\u2019s 1973-1990 dictatorship, and in 2001, the then president, Ricardo Lagos, revealed that at least 120 of them were later thrown to their deaths from helicopters into \u201cChile\u2019s ocean, lakes and rivers\u201d. T-shirts making light of such atrocities have become popular among the far right, and were openly on sale on Amazon \u2013 where shoppers could choose garments emblazoned with Pinochet\u2019s face alongside images of helicopters or slogans such as \u201cFree Helicopter Rides\u201d. Survivors of the dictatorship expressed outrage that the e-commerce giant could sell T-shirts mocking violent killings. \u201cIt is unbearable for people like me who had to endure that time when people were thrown alive into the sea from helicopters,\u201d the Chilean author Diamela Eltit told the Guardian. \u201cThis is not only hurtful, it is also incomprehensibly cruel. It shows how the worst part of humanity can be absorbed by the market and transformed into an object of consumption,\u201d she said. Other T-shirts available on Amazon depicted a body in freefall from a helicopter beneath the caption \u201cWanna take a ride?\u201d or showed a helicopter with the legend \u201cPinochet Is My Co-Pilot\u201d. One shirt \u2013 depicting a helicopter beneath the legend \u201cAnti-Commie Action\u201d \u2013 was advertised on Amazon as \u201cthe perfect gift for any Patriot, Trump supporter, conservative, republican person you may know.\u201d When asked for comment by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Amazon said: \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action, including potential removal of their account. The products in question have been removed.\u201d Most of the garments disappeared from the website, but several were still available on Friday. The popularity of Pinochet T-shirts among the US far-right was first highlighted during the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the white nationalist Christopher Cantwell wore one in an interview with Vice. Last year, a political storm erupted in Chile when the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast \u2013 who came fourth in the 2017 presidential elections \u2013 was pictured alongside a supporter wearing a T-shirt saying \u201cPinochet\u2019s Helicopter Tours\u201d. Although Kast has often spoken favourably of Pinochet\u2019s dictatorial regime, the politician said he did not realise what the T-shirt said when he was asked to pose for the selfie. Tens of thousands of people were detained or tortured following Chile\u2019s 1973 coup. In the first month after coming to power, Pinochet ordered his military to round up more than 10,000 students, workers and political activists in Chile\u2019s National Stadium, which became an improvised concentration camp and torture centre. Earlier this month, Amazon was forced to pull Christmas ornaments decorated with images of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where over 1 million people were murdered during Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. Eltit, who founded the Collective of Art Actions (Cada) in 1979 as an act of resistance against censorship during the dictatorship, described the sale of such items on Amazon as a tear in the fabric of society. \u201cThese examples \u2013 the Auschwitz Christmas ornaments, or T-shirts depicting bodies thrown alive into the sea \u2013 are a metaphor of how the social pacts that bind us together are being broken by free-market consumerism,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
