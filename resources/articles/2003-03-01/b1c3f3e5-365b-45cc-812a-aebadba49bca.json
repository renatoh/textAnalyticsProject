Souness was so glorious as a player at Liverpool, then a player-manager at Rangers, then manager, that the accumulation of silverware was part and parcel of daily life. Souness also treasures the fact that he kept Southampton up at a time when they looked incapable of doing so and last season he guided Blackburn Rovers to the Worthington Cup. In short, Souness knows what it takes to win medals. It was, therefore, puzzling to hear him downgrade Newcastle United's victory here on Saturday. Rightly he pointed out that Newcastle's last three goals came in a burst in the last few minutes of the match, and that at 2-1 down Blackburn had two decent opportunities to equalise, one of which was squandered by the substitute Andy Cole in front of his former Gallowgate fan club. But Souness knows from his playing days at Anfield 20 years ago that the game lasts 90 minutes. Titles and trophies are won with resilience as much as talent sometimes, and Newcastle, in their 47th match of the season, showed more of both than Blackburn did. Newcastle, moreover, had just played Barcelona in their 46th. \"We came out of the game on Wednesday and you'd think if any team was to dip it would be us,\" said Kieron Dyer, once again irrepressible. \"But we ran riot in the last 15 minutes.\" Dyer speaks the way he plays and occasionally his mouth runs off at a fanciful tilt. But he has promised that Newcastle will continue to run riot in what represents the last 15 minutes of their season. Dyer credited Newcastle's fitness coach, Paul \"Windy\" Winsper, with the squad's stamina. \"He is an unsung hero at Newcastle,\" said Dyer. \"I think we're one of the fittest in the league. The last seven games is when tiredness comes in and when you use the squad. That's when fitness comes in. \"All our games are winnable games. I know people look at Man United as tricky but we have them at St James' Park and we have lost only once here in the league this season. We'll be looking to win that. If we win all our games, who knows?\" Manchester United visit in mid-April and it is fast becoming a decisive fixture due to Newcastle's refusal to let the championship become two-horse. Although Arsenal outclassed Newcastle in the first half here six weeks ago, the feeling persists on Tyneside that had Laurent Robert not been dismissed by referee Neale Barry - back again on Saturday - Newcastle could have won that game. There is no inferiority complex among Sir Bobby Robson's players and the way they dismantled a side that beat Arsenal the previous Saturday spoke of confidence. And also depth. Robson returned to Portman Road on Friday - Ipswich looking ever more like Newcastle's feeder club - to sign the 19-year-old Darren Ambrose for next season. But Robson is already able to introduce players from the bench of the calibre of Jermaine Jenas, Hugo Viana and Shola Ameobi. There were three lovely touches from Viana in the last three goals. The excellent Aaron Hughes collected Viana's first pass and then teed up Jenas for a rifle that made it 3-1 on 85 minutes. Dyer picked up Viana's second, then forced Vratislav Gresko to score an own goal with Ameobi waiting. Viana himself supplied a sublime third inswinger for Craig Bellamy to lash in the fifth. That was the goal of the game, which, given the quality of Damien Duff's equalising volley, is saying something. Duff did little else, however, putting him in a category with Hakan Sukur and Dwight Yorke. Presumably Yorke thought his 14th-minute toe-poke at Shay Given entitled him to the very visible spat with Souness when replaced by Cole. Blackburn held their own in that early period but as Gary Speed and Dyer gradually took over midfield, Newcastle began to dominate. Robert produced a spiky display topped by a double pirouette that set up Nolberto Solano to climb above Duff to head home. Duff's beautiful shot brought Blackburn level but Robert scored with a curling free-kick, having hit the post with another one. \"Seven games left and we're still in it,\" said Robson. If they keep on keeping on, they are contenders. Man of the match: Kieron Dyer (Newcastle United)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
