Egeli Rasta, 27, disappeared last July. Her body was discovered 12 days later partially buried in a shallow grave on Mitcham common after a limb was seen protruding above the ground. Garath Davies, 23, from Mitcham, denies murdering Ms Rasta, an Estonian national, and perverting the course of justice by burying the body to avoid detection. The jury heard he was a \"loner\" and that a knife found in the home he shared with his mother contained Ms Rasta's blood. Mark Ellison, prosecuting, said Ms Rasta, who lived near Mitcham common, was \"fit, athletic, and quite strong\", and would often jog and sunbathe there. He said there was evidence Mr Davies had been in the copse where the body was found, and damp and bloodstained clothing bearing Ms Rasta's DNA was found in his rucksack at his home. A knife bearing blood matching hers was found in a sock in his holdall, he added. Mr Davies was also found with Ms Rasta's mobile phone in his pocket, then lied to police about where he had got it, Mr Ellison told the court. He \"chopped and changed\" the explanations he gave police and claimed to have suffered \"unbelievable\" losses of memory. Police tracked down Mr Davies after he was found to have used the phone to send texts and photo messages of his dog, a black Staffordshire bull terrier, to a friend. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
