Keane was omitted from the first-team party who departed on Thursday for their 11-day tour of Hong Kong, China and Japan as he recovered from a hamstring strain sustained during the get-together on the Algarve. Confirmation that the 33-year-old Republic of Ireland midfielder had publicly clashed with his manager cast fresh doubt over whether the injury was the true reason for his absence, though sources close to Keane insisted last night that the incident had been blown up out of proportion. There certainly appears to be little chance that the furious argument will have any impact on Keane's position as captain or, indeed, seriously damage the pair's 12-year working relationship. Yet the spat, which took place in front of other players, was an unfortunate start to a pivotal season for United; they have a new owner in Malcolm Glazer and the campaign is likely to be Keane's last at the club. The disagreement appears to have centred on living arrangements at United's week-long training camp in Portugal. Ferguson, who had called his players back to pre-season a week earlier than usual, had intended to put them largely through conditioning work on the Algarve but, with only half-days on the practice pitches, he had invited the players' wives and families to join the set-up. Keane had been holidaying at his own villa nearby with his wife and five children but, having moved his family to the complex United had hired, deemed the arrangements unsuitable. His decision to move back into his own villa is understood to have enraged Ferguson. Keane returned from Portugal nursing the hamstring injury, though the decision not to include him in the party that departed for Hong Kong last Thursday was taken despite the fact that he had taken part in a full training session only 24 hours previously. The veteran, who is entering the last year of his contract at Old Trafford, missed the friendlies against Clyde and Peterborough and has instead been training with the juniors and reserves - along with Wes Brown and Gabriel Heinze - at Carrington in the first team's absence. \"It's all a storm in a teacup,\" insisted a source close to Keane. \"Roy was almost fit enough to go on the Far East tour but they thought that he'd be better off not travelling on a 12-hour flight on a cramped aeroplane. That would not have done his hamstring any good. As it is, Roy is training back in Manchester.\" Keane's adviser Michael Kennedy said: \"He remained in Manchester in order to continue his treatment for a hamstring injury. Any disagreement he may have had with his manager is a private matter and will not be the subject of comment by him in the media.\" Ferguson and Keane have clashed before since the Irishman was signed from Nottingham Forest for \u00a33.75m in 1993, which is hardly a surprise given their volcanic personalities. Indeed, the United manager has long since learned that a stand-off of a few days is not uncommon after disagreements with his captain. Club officials refused to comment yesterday, with the team in transit before the game against Beijing Hyundai tomorrow. On Saturday they beat the Hong Kong national side 2-0, a comfortable win despite the profligacy of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Louis Saha and even Wayne Rooney. United had 26 attempts at goal but consistently choked in presentable positions. Instead, with Ferguson swapping his entire side at half-time, the youngsters Giuseppe Rossi and the debutant Dong Fangzhou spared the visitors' blushes. Ferguson employed Alan Smith in Keane's central-midfield berth. \"Alan was superb,\" said the manager. \"He kept encouraging and cajoling the rest of the team and put in a very good performance.\" Look back in anger Rolex rant November 2004 Keane castigates the United team for their 'Rolex culture' and playboy lifestyles.
