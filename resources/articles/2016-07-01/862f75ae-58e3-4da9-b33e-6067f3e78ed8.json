Bacca, who moved to Italy from Sevilla last summer for \u20ac30m despite interest from Liverpool, has been told he can leave San Siro after West Ham\u2019s \u00a326m offer was accepted last week. Yet after failing in their attempts to sign Michy Batshuayi when the Belgium striker joined Chelsea instead, co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have yet to make a breakthrough over proposed personal terms with Bacca\u2019s agent, who arrived in London on Monday for talks. However, it is understood that despite his initial reluctance to leave Milan, the 29-year-old is now open to the idea of joining Slaven Bilic\u2019s side. Last month, Bacca\u2019s agent told the Guardian that his client was keen to play in European competition next season after Milan failed to qualify after their seventh-placed finish in Serie A. West Ham, who also finished seventh in the Premier League, will discover their opponents in the Europa League third qualifying round when the draw is made on Friday. Despite Milan\u2019s disappointing season, Bacca scored 18 goals in the league to end the campaign as Italy\u2019s third top scorer, behind Napoli\u2019s Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Paulo Dybala of Juventus. Bacca scored 34 goals in 71 appearances for Sevilla, having joined from the Belgian side Club Brugge in 2013. He arrived in Europe at the age of 24 having spent his formative years at Barranquilla-based Atl\u00e9tico Junior, where he worked as a bus driver\u2019s assistant to supplement his income. There were also reports in France on Monday night that West Ham have made an approach for Swansea\u2019s Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis, the France striker who has also been linked with Marseille. Earlier on Monday, the club announced the season-long loan signing of the Besiktas winger Gokhan Tore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
