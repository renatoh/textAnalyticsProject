The company's housekeeper, Annie Bradbery, prides herself on the spread. \"It's high-quality, simple and stylish,\" she says. \"The chocolate is organic, and I select all the food and drinks carefully. People just help themselves as they come in, and it creates a very good atmosphere - people enjoy working here.\" It seems that more and more thoughtful companies are offering free, or nearly-free, breakfast to hungry staff - so if your office boasts only a clapped-out kettle, or a vending machine selling custard creams or long-life Cornish pasties, don't read on. Every survey known to man - and woman - shows that a good brekkie sets you up for the day: productivity is increased, you feel better and aren't faint with hunger by lunchtime. And, today, many of us eat that meal at work rather than at home. \"I prefer picking up breakfast when I arrive at work, it saves me time and effort in the morning. I don't have time to make myself anything, but I know that when I get in I can choose from cereals, fresh fruit, or a croissant and tea, to set me up for the day,\" says PA Mary McCabe. Companies now offer everything - from fried breakfasts at the Abbey National head office to herbal teas at the ICL head office in Slough. If you choose to take in your own breakfast, try to avoid cereal bars, crisps and sugary snacks, or mayo-loaded sandwiches. According to Carol Charlton, of the Organic Cafe, the perfect office breakfast to buy or make is \"organic yoghurt, a piece of fruit, a flapjack (preferably organic) and a wholemeal sandwich - sardines are good, so is avocado and tomato on brown bread. \"If you include all of these,\" Charlton says, \"you'll keep going for ages and need little at lunch.\" However, she admits that office workers flock to the Organic Cafes for their famous \"meat breakfast\" - \u00a36 for organic sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes. Once a month, the chief executive of Consolidated Communications, a PR company in London, takes six staff to breakfast at a Soho coffee house at 8am - eggs and bacon and espresso all round. All the 100 staff are treated in turn - this is the company that also offers two \"duvet days\" a year for those times when you can't face getting up. Sadly, breakfast in bed is not provided. Diana Cambridge Lunch: Grab your sandwich and kiss it, kids. Today, Office Hours is celebrating lunchtime, and we're all going to have a proper lunch for once. \"Lunch?\" I hear you yelp. \"Everyone will sneer, and call me a part-timer if I shirk off for a lunch break. No, I'll sit here, frowning at my monitor, and hope no one minds the chewing noises I'm making.\" Well, comrades, we do mind. Not because you should be able to eat without sounding like the boiling muds of New Zealand. Or because you might catch nasty bugs from your grubby old keyboard. Those are bad noises to hear because you should take that lunch break and get out of the office. And if you won't listen to us, take Virginia Woolf's advice: \"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.\" \"Loving\" and \"sleeping\" on the job can get you fired, but \"thinking well\" should be a priority for us all. And, as the lady says, that means eating well. If you make sandwiches, you can eat what you like - some people make five rounds every Sunday and freeze the blighters, removing them before leaving for work. By lunchtime, they're either ready to eat - or ready for emergency dental surgery. Buying sarnies each day, though, means you have to leave the office - and maybe sit in the park, taking some air. But to stop you feeding the ducks with shoddy sandwiches, we tested three of Britain's most popular sarnie shops to sort the ciabattas from the cheese and pickles: Starbucks, Boots and Pret a Manger. For \u00a32.85, Starbucks lets you cart off a \"Mediterranean granary bloomer\" stuffed with humous, roast vegetables and pinenuts. It even throws in soothing jazz and the comforting aroma of brewing coffee while you wait. At the other end of your wallet, Boots does tomato, rocket and parmesan on tomato bread for a bargain \u00a31.70. But it turns out to be too cheap to be true. The bread is a frighteningly vivid orange and the filling little more than an effect, containing \"parmesan-style cheese\". The best buy is Pret's Chicken Caesar. For \u00a32.39, the fresh granary bread, tender chicken, and generous salad in lovely blobs of dressing is about as good as lunch can be. With options such as these, we say lunch should be for ever, not just for Christmas. So today let's make a stand. Office Hours is out to lunch. And come 1 o'clock, so should you be. Tim Ross Dinner: It's 7.46pm. You've missed East-Enders. In fact you've never even seen EastEnders. It's one of those things, like daylight, TV dinners and your children, that you never see, because you're always stuck working late in the office. Half an hour later you're so hungry you can't even think straight; you're gnawing the empty polystyrene cup on your desk and fantasising about halibut. Sadly, the only thing available at this hour is a packet of Monster Munch and a withered old Cornish pasty from Mr Cheapo's 24 hour Cheapomarket down the road. Or is it? Is it heck. Why make do with a warty old hand of a dinner when you could be devouring scrumptious gourmet concoctions in the comfort of your own office? Simon works for a management consultancy firm in the City. \"We have a microwave in our office, but no one uses it,\" he says, mournfully, \"and facilities for making soup, and a coffee machine, which is broken. Plus a toaster.\" But an oxtail soup and a couple of rounds of sliced white ain't gonna see you through 'til the wee small hours. So if Simon's working late, his company will fork out for his dinner - he can pop out for noodles or, more usually, have food delivered to the office. Most of his colleagues are used to ordering in their evening meals, but it's an art-form that takes a bit of practice. \"Ordering from Pizza Hut is generally seen as a sign of inexperience,\" says Simon, with disdain. Food delivery services are booming. We're not talking about your local Golden Monkey Chinese takeaway here, but companies that provide quality grub and much more. Sadly the majority are London-based. www.roomservice.co.uk collects your grub from restaurants in the city, and delivers them to your desk for a piffling \u00a34. There's a vast range of menus, including Mexican, Japanese, Greek and Italian, and it will also bring you a bottle of vino, should you feel in need of \"inspiration\". Call 020-7644 6666 for details. Claiming to be \"fresh, authentic, delicious and hot\" (don't we all, baby) is www.deliverance.co.uk, which delivers food cooked in its own kitchens. You can sample such delights as kedgeree, Moroccan lamb tagine, orange cheesecake and H\u00e4agen Dazs. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a312. Call 0800 019 1111 (SW London), or 0800 019 2222 (central London). Now all you need do is getting that wasabe off your keyboard.
