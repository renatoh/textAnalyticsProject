The lucrative and glitzy evening \u2013 the party\u2019s Black and White Election Fundraiser \u2013 will be one of the party\u2019s principal fundraising events in the runup to next May\u2019s general election. Last year\u2019s Black and White Ball attracted 570 guests worth \u00a322bn, as well as David Cameron and at least 18 other ministers. One Tory donor told the Guardian that if he buys a premium table at the event for \u00a315,000 this year, he can expect the company of a cabinet minister. If he paid \u00a35,000 for a standard table, he would expect a junior minister. The ball has been organised by a 63-strong committee, including City donors, oil tycoons and recent converts to the Conservative cause. It includes Karren Brady, the recently ennobled Tory peer from BBC1\u2019s The Apprentice, Philip Mould, an expert from Antiques Roadshow, the owners of several hedge funds and three makeup artists. The chair of the fundraising event\u2019s committee is Zoe Law, a celebrity makeup artist who has toured with the singer Dido. She is married to Andrew Law, the chief executive of a New York-based trading and investment firm, who has donated more than \u00a31m to the Tories. She has been joined on the committee by two other makeup artists, Lee Pycroft and Sarah Reygate, whose clients include Anne Hathaway, Naomi Watts and Elle Macpherson. Labour said the list of organisers underlined the exclusive nature of David Cameron\u2019s fundraising network. The committee includes 21 registered donors to the party, who have contributed more than \u00a34.6m. More than a quarter (25.3%) of the organising committee are linked to the world of finance, and at least seven committee members are donors who have previously attended private dinners with Cameron. Jon Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet office minister, said the plans appeared to show that Cameron was trying to buy the election. \u201cThese shady, secretive dinners show us that the Tory campaign relies on the funding of vested interests rather than the energy which comes from taking on vested interests to advance the wellbeing of working people,\u201d he said. Tory officials dismissed the allegations, and pointed out that Tony Blair had successfully courted many wealthy backers, while, they argued, Ed Miliband has tried and failed to do so. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAll donations to the Conservative party are fully and transparently declared to the electoral commission and published on [its] website. Any suggestion of impropriety is defamatory and malicious and will be treated as such.\u201d Invitations to the event have been sent out in the past two weeks, according to a party official. Perhaps wary of being accused of appearing out of touch, the organisers have asked men to wear suits, as opposed to black tie, while women are encouraged to wear cocktail dresses to the event. A letter encourages potential guests to sign up to premium, premier or standard tables for \u00a315,000, \u00a310,000 or \u00a35,000 respectively. According to one donor, last year a minister was assigned to each table. Those who paid the most were given the higher-profile ministers, he said. Others on the organising committee included donors who have previously attended private dinners with Cameron. They include Henry Angest, the chairman of Arbuthnot Bank and a former Tory party treasurer. He has been criticised for controlling a credit company, Everyday Loans, which charges members of the public interest at an average of 74.8% APR. Before the last election he gave the Conservatives a \u00a35m overdraft at 3.5%. He declined to comment. Ian Taylor, the CEO of the billion-dollar oil company Vitol, is also a committee member who has dined with the prime minister. A spokesman for Vitol would not comment on the fundraising event. Another is Michael Wade, a British executive and chairman of the insurance giant Besso group. According to the magazine Tatler, he recently celebrated his 60th birthday by conducting a symphony for 200 friends in Smith Square in London\u2019s Westminster. The income generated from political party fundraising events is subject to the reporting requirements set out by law under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Parties must report donations to the Electoral Commission if they are above the reporting thresholds of \u00a37,500 for donations made to the central party and \u00a31,500 for donations made to to a local party.The Conservatives received double the donations of Labour and 60 times more than Ukip in the three months to the end of September, including more than \u00a31m from hedge funds and \u00a3150,000 from the wife of a former Russian government minister, who bought the right to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson. According to figures from the Electoral Commission, the Conservatives received a total of \u00a36.8m between July and September, much of it from people connected to the world of finance. In the same period, Labour brought in \u00a33.2m, of which \u00a31.3m was from trade unions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
