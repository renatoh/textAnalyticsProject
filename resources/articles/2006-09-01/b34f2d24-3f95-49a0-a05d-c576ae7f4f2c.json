It's profitable and seems steady. But you're now in your 40s and you feel like you're not seeing enough of your family. Your business employs 20 people and turns over a couple of million a year - but now feels like the right time to take the money and run. This is the first time it has occurred to you that you could sell your organisation and, to be honest, you rather like the thought. The problem is that according to a number of experts and people with real-life experience, you've already left it very late to start planning your exit. Cedric Robertshaw, an advisor at Birmingham Business Link, says it's very difficult to persuade entrepreneurs with new start-ups to think about planning their exit from the beginning. \"Most people starting a business just can't take it in,\" he says. \"Most of the people we advise have very little direct experience of business.\" This can lead to difficulties when people are ready to sell - and many people eventually do want to sell: after all, they've worked for some sort of reward. \"When they come to sell they find they've put in no infrastructure,\" says Robertshaw. \"It's very difficult to sell at that stage.\" Typically, an entrepreneur will have been so engrossed in running the business that they will have put themselves almost irretrievably at its centre, so they find if they sell and try to exit there's nothing left. This will hammer the value of the business into the ground. \"A lot of people have to wind up instead,\" says Robertshaw - which presumably demolishes the plan for an easier life on retirement. Mark Roy founded data management company the REaD Group in 1991 and is still chief executive. But he is planning to leave by the time he is 50, and everybody who works with him is aware of this. \"The key point of an exit strategy is to achieve value,\" he says. \"One needs to be aware of that strategy from a long way back. And if you're looking at how to achieve that strategy you need to have an active timeline, or else you can drift.\" Having agreed the timeline with his board, some of the decisions the board might otherwise have taken have changed. \"Over the last 12 months we've acquired some companies, and we've learned that acquisition is probably the most expensive thing you can do. We're absolutely adamant that over the next 12 months there are not going to be any distractions to the business. We've invested in organisations to enhance our product offering, but our next target for this year is a step mark in the value of the company.\" This means keep the cash in the bank and don't buy any other companies for a while. \"We've looked at the way the organisation is run and what we're not going to do - we're not going to add lots of products to our portfolio and we're not going to acquire anything else.\" Strategical planning This is the effect of a decision taken years ago, and it appears unlikely that people will achieve the value they want if they don't allow themselves some time. Indeed, Robertshaw reckons people should start thinking about getting out about three or four years before they actually need to. \"It depends on the complexity of your business, but that's true for a lot of businesses we talk to who have, say, 20 people.\" Actually selling a business can be a complex process, but before you even get there you have to consider how to sustain your staff's interest. Everybody who has worked with any substantial business will be aware, when there's an acquisition, that the first thing the newly-acquired personnel start doing is fretting about their jobs. Roy's belief is that full disclosure to everyone as early as possible is in everyone's best interests. \"For the last three or four years I've made it clear that my 50th is the target. The thing is not to have it as a surprise for the members of staff; whoever buys our business will have ideas about positioning it and it should become exciting as the staff think about it.\" Clearly the next stage is valuing your company and actually finding a buyer. Russell Veitch, a director at specialist business seller KWS, finds a lot of clients get the process slightly skewed. \"They come to us and ask, 'what's our business worth', and I have to tell them it's worth whatever someone will pay for it.\" The identity of the buyer can be crucial. Veitch quotes one company that sold security tags to the retail trade. It attracted a \u00a3600,000 offer from a business angel investor but also a \u00a31.7m offer from a trade buyer whose business was compatible and who wanted the organisation rather than just money. It won't come as much of a surprise to hear that they opted for the \u00a31.7m. Again, getting the most value out of a company has a lot to do with planning an exit in advance. \"The thing to do is to try to spend time working on the business rather than in it,\" says Veitch. So for example if you're a hairdresser, he says, you could try to do less hairdressing - the fact that your employees do the work will be among your assets when you come to sell - and instead look at the shape of the business. Do you own or lease your equipment, for example. Does it add value to your company? Veitch also urges people to buy the premises on which they work wherever possible as the plant then becomes an asset on the balance sheet. \"I suppose in this instance you'd need to become a businessperson who happens to be a hairdresser rather than the other way around.\" The biggest potential blocker of a sale, he says, has to be the manager who is intrinsically part of the business. \"Too many owners are too embedded in their company,\" he says. \"You can almost always double the value of a company if the owner isn't too heavily involved in the day to day stuff.\" He also advises forgetting anything you've been told about working out how much a company is worth. All the multiples on all the spreadsheets in the world won't help when it comes to an apathetic market that just doesn't want to bite. All our experts agree that there's no substitute for an exit planned extremely well in advance. If you can somehow put this into the initial business plan, then so much the better. If you can identify the right people to start taking over a year or two in advance, great, and if you can plant the idea that they might want to buy the whole shebang themselves, so much the better. But whatever you do, the time to start thinking about it is probably well before you actually want to get out. \"Last week\" would be a good time to start. Advice - Selling up and staying in Not everyone who sells a business actually wants to leave the organisation. Ed Bartlett was a computer game writer who saw a lot of his market implode when Microsoft and Sony started dominating and 30 game companies went to the wall in a year. He decided to move sideways and founded The Hive, which effectively acted as an ad agency for product placement in computer games. He signed up clients including Red Bull and in a short while the organisation was in profit. His decision to sell came not because trading was tough or because of any adverse circumstances, but because software company IGA made an offer at the end of 2004. IGA had the technology to track adverts and responses in games - it was a natural fit and came with the opportunity to go international immediately. Bartlett took a stake in IGA by way of payment for his organisation -and he hasn't regretted it. \"It was a matter of owning 100% of something very small or 10% of something bigger,\" he says. The experience has left him with strong views about being acquired and where some people go wrong. Selling when you're short of cash, he says, is the worst thing you can do since it'll come out in the due diligence and the buyer will have an absolute view of the situation. They'll be in a good position to take you for every penny they can. \"Your planning will be very different if you're looking to exit to retire, compared with exiting in order to increase your ultimate potential return or exiting to change direction or focus,\" he says. He also advises against over-valuing your business as you'll almost certainly be shot down. It's very easy to find you've been objective and businesslike for years and then find yourself inflating your concern's value because, dammit, it's your baby..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
