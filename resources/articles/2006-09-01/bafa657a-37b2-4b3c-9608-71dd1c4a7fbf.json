The move follows a \u00a3280m bid at the end of July by Harrah's, one of the big players on the Las Vegas Strip, for London Clubs International, another leading UK casino operator. What is attracting such heavyweights to the UK is the prospect of getting a foothold on what is, from their point of view, virtually virgin territory. \"You have very successful cash-generative businesses wondering where to invest the capital,\" says Ivor Jones, an analyst at Panmure Gordon. While some potential markets such as Macao, which is set to overtake Las Vegas as the world's biggest gambling market, are approaching maturity, others remain tightly regulated. With regulations in the UK about to be relaxed, it is one of the few places that offers the prospect of growth. Until recently, casinos in the UK were small fry compared with their counterparts elsewhere in the world and, in particular, in the US. The 1968 Gaming Act, which was introduced as a response to the gangland crime wave that accompanied the boom in gaming in the 1960s, restricted the hours casinos could open, limited the number of slot machines they could have to 10 and jackpots to \u00a32,000. Worst of all, they couldn't advertise. Last year's Gambling Act changes all that. A regulation requiring all gamblers to be members of a casino for at least 24 hours before they could play, in effect a \"cooling off period\" to prevent impulse gambling, has already been lifted. Industry estimates suggest that attendances at casinos are already up 10% as a result. But the big changes are still to come. From next year, casino operators will be able to apply for licences for a new generation of casinos. That means infinitely bigger, brasher casinos with more slot machines - the main revenue source for Vegas-style casinos - and bigger payouts. The biggest prize of all for casino operators is a licence to build what the government euphemistically calls a \"regional\" casino but is in effect a casino resort along the lines of those on the Vegas Strip. It will be given to one of seven shortlisted cities across the UK. One site is Greenwich, south London, which could mean a casino in the Millennium Dome. The government hopes that, wherever it is built, the supercasino will contribute to urban regeneration. It is likely to include a hotel, restaurants and concert venues, and will be allowed to have 1,250 slot machines with unlimited jackpots. If successful, it is expected the government could issue more licences. In addition, licences will be given for another eight \"large\" and eight \"small\" casinos, though in reality all 16 will be bigger than anything seen in the UK up to now: even the so-called \"small\" casinos will be able to have up to 80 slot machines with jackpots of up to \u00a34,000. Best of all from the point of view of casino operators, they will be able to advertise. The details are still to be finalised, and consultation is being carried out. But Wayne Brown, an analyst at Altium Securities, says he anticipates massive advertising on TV and billboards, aimed above all at attracting tourists. \"It's going to dramatically change the environment at casinos in the UK,\" he says. To the likes of Genting and Harrah's, the deregulation offers the prospect of releasing what they believe is a massive pent-up demand for gambling in the UK. It is estimated that only 2-4% of adults in the UK have ever been to a casino, compared with 14% in France and even more in the US. It is thought 40,000 Britons go abroad to gamble every year. Genting and Harrah's clearly think the best way to get a piece of this market is to acquire an existing player. London Clubs, which nearly went bankrupt after its own attempts to buy into the Las Vegas strip, operates six high-end casinos in the UK, four of which are in London. It has licences under the 1968 act to build another six around the country, all of which will be between 45-55,000 square feet, which is big by British standards. Harrah's, which bid for London Clubs at the end of July, owns several casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, including Caesars Palace. Another key Las Vegas player, which many analysts expect to make its move into the UK soon, is MGM Mirage. It owns the Bellagio and MGM Grand, two of the biggest, most spectacular resorts on the Strip and last year acquired the group that owned the Mandalay Bay. MGM is involved in proposals for the regional casino in three cities: Newcastle, where it is working with Newcastle United Football Club, Sheffield and Glasgow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
