Agyemang harried Blackburn from the start and Craig Short was glad to see the youngster go off five minutes from the end of a game the visitors might easily have won. However, Burton fears he may be bringing players through only for other clubs to benefit, and described the transfer change as \"frightening.\" \"It's a real concern for a club like ours. We don't want to be a showcase for other clubs to pick up players on the cheap,\" he said. \"We need protection.\" Agyemang is in a direct line of fearsome, fast front-men bred by Wimbledon over the years and his partnership with Jason Euell may yet lift the Londoners into the play-offs. Euell threatened Rovers with their second league defeat in 16 games when he ghosted in for his 18th goal of the season after 50 minutes. And only the home goalkeeper Brad Friedel prevented further damage to Blackburn's chances of an automatic promotion spot before Matt Jansen salvaged a point in the 73rd minute. Graeme Souness had an explanation for Blackburn's distinctly off-key display: \"I suspected it might happen. The [midweek] game at Birmingham drained a lot out of the players and for the first time this season they looked tired.\" The manager criticised the FA for ordering his injured midfielder David Dunn to link up with the England party even though he has no chance of playing. \"I'm angry about it,\" he said. \"Don't they believe us?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
