On the evening of the historic day that the House of Representatives voted to formalize impeachment proceedings against him, Trump proclaimed his innocence in an Oval Office interview with the Washington Examiner. Meanwhile, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who announced the launch of the impeachment inquiry in September, appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s late-night TV show and said: \u201cI pray for the United States of America.\u201d Pelosi said: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. We don\u2019t want to impeach a president. We don\u2019t want the reality that a president has done something that is in violation of the constitution.\u201d But a defiant Trump defended himself from the allegation at the heart of the inquiry \u2013 that he pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Joe Biden and delayed vital military aid to Ukraine as a quid pro quo. Trump has previously described the central phone call in which he asked Zelenskiy for \u201ca favor\u201d as a \u201cperfect\u201d call. In his latest interview, he modified that by saying it was \u201ca good call\u201d. He said: \u201cAt some point, I\u2019m going to sit down, perhaps as a fireside chat on live television, and I will read the transcript of the call, because people have to hear it. When you read it, it\u2019s a straight call.\u201d Trump also floated the idea of making T-shirts with the message \u201cRead the transcript\u201d as part of the White House strategy to defend him in the impeachment inquiry \u2013 which is likely to proceed in the next few months to a congressional trial in the Senate. He reiterated that the White House will not cooperate with the investigation, in terms of acceding to demands for documents and witnesses from the Democratic-dominated House or obeying subpoenas. After a whistleblower from the US intelligence community made a formal complaint about the substance of the phone call, the White House issued a memo that revealed much of the phone dialogue \u2013 echoing the whistleblower\u2019s details \u2013 but was not a full transcript. Trump also sharply contrasted his situation with that of the Democratic president Bill Clinton in his second term, over an affair with a White House intern, and the fate of the Republican president Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 as he was facing the impeachment process and likely removal from office. \u201cEverybody knows I did nothing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBill Clinton did things wrong; Richard Nixon did things wrong. I won\u2019t go back to [Andrew] Johnson because that was a little before my time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they did things wrong. I did nothing wrong.\u201d Nixon was at the head of a conspiracy and cover-up that centered on the break-in of the Democratic National Committee office in the Watergate building in Washington in 1972 to steal dirt on his political opponents. Johnson was impeached in 1868 on congressional charges relating to political corruption. On Thursday, for only the third time in the history of the modern presidency, the US House of Representatives voted to formalize the impeachment proceedings. In a largely party-line vote of 232-196, the House embarked on a path that seemed likely to lead to Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 if not necessarily his removal from office. Pelosi presided over the vote and marked it with a bang of her gavel. Republicans held ranks to vote uniformly against the process, while two Democrats crossed party lines to join them. The House\u2019s sole independent, former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan, voted to advance the resolution. The vote set rules for the public phase of the inquiry, laying out a plan for impeachment that could produce dramatic televised public hearings within two weeks and a vote on impeachment itself by the end of the year. For weeks, congressional investigators have been interviewing witnesses \u2013 15 and counting \u2013 behind closed doors about alleged misconduct by Trump, who stands accused of using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 US election. Witnesses have been called to appear behind closed doors next week, before a shift to open hearings and the drawing up of official articles of impeachment. A simple majority vote in favor in the House would then move the process to the Senate for a likely trial of the president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
