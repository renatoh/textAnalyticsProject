Whatever it was Steve Bates, the director of rugby at Newcastle, headed back to the north-east happier than his opposite number, Richard Cockerill. \"It is strange, but the boys in the dressing room are in a pretty grim mood because we know we can play better than that. But that is probably a good thing because there's a momentum growing here,\" said Leicester's captain, Geordan Murphy. The reason for the glass-half-empty philosophy at Welford Road is not hard to explain. The Tigers have won two of their three Premiership games but their only scorer this season has been Jeremy Staunton, a stop-gap fly-half who has kicked 14 penalties. A glass-half-full man might point out that Leicester are yet to concede a try as well as score one, and that they are as enduring as Bruce Forsyth. But the statistics are damning. Their previous record for not scoring in the Premiership was 217 minutes, in the autumn of 1999. That mark now stands at 259 minutes. It was not the way Leicester wanted to mark their first home match of the season and the unveiling of the Caterpillar Stand, a \u00a315m structure the club say is the second largest single-tier stand, after Anfield's Kop, in the country. It raises the capacity of Welford Road to 24,000 and it is a magnificent sight. The atmosphere raised the hairs on the back of the neck but the game, like caterpillar tyres, merely rumbled along. Leicester will begin clicking through higher gears once Sam Vesty and Toby Flood return as playmakers this autumn and it is not Staunton's fault that he is not Dan Carter but the Tigers will have to be more inventive by the time South Africa arrive in November for a game to mark the stand's official opening. Dan Hipkiss is set to return at Bath this Saturday and the centre should form a productive partnership with Anthony Allen. Allen won two caps, against Argentina and New Zealand, three years ago, when he was barely 20. It was a torrid baptism and a mixture of indifferent form and injury has since made him England's forgotten man. However, he has been revitalised by a summer move from Gloucester and he looked the back most likely to end the try drought on Saturday. He was prepared to get his hands dirty too, in a wincingly physical game, hauling Rob Miller to the ground to prevent a rare Falcons try opportunity midway through the first half.
