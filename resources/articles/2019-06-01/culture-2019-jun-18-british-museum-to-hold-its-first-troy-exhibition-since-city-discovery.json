The German millionaire-archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann had been excavating for some years at Hisarl\u0131k in north-western Turkey, then newly established as the historical site of Homer\u2019s legendary city, when he approached the museum in the 1870s with plans for an exhibition of his finds. Claiming lack of space, it turned him down. Almost 150 years later, the museum is finally making up for that oversight, with the announcement of an exhibition later this year on the myths and historical truth of Troy \u2013 still the first major such showcase to take place in Britain. Featuring 300 objects dating from the bronze age to the present day, the exhibition will highlight how the stories of Helen, Paris, Achilles, and the wooden horse that ultimately brought down the city have inspired artists throughout history. A loan from the Berlin museums will allow the British Museum to showcase almost 100 of Schliemann\u2019s finds from the real city that inspired Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey \u2013 including pottery and silver vessels, bronze weapons and stone sculptures. Alexandra Villing, lead curator for the exhibition, said the Trojan war was \u201cone of the greatest stories ever told \u2013 about a war which has become an archetype for all wars\u201d. The legend had lived so vibrantly for three millennia, she said, inspiring Roman, medieval and modern day writers and artists, because \u201cit\u2019s a story that really has it all \u2013 love and loss, courage and passion, violence and vengeance, twists and turns, triumph and tragedy\u201d. Among the works to go on display at the exhibition, opening in November, she highlighted an Athenian black-figure amphora dating from 530BC, showing Achilles killing the Amazonian queen Penthesilea \u2013 which is the moment when he falls in love with her. Villing described it as \u201cone of the most iconic ancient images\u201d to be highlighted. Another star exhibit will be an exquisite Roman silver cup, dated to the first century AD and excavated from the grave of an iron age Danish chieftain, which shows the moment King Priam kisses the hands of Achilles, who had just killed his son Hector. As well as archaeological, classical and neo-classical treasures, the exhibition will include contemporary responses to the Trojan legend, including a large-scale photographic work by the American feminist artist Eleanor Antin showing a thoroughly cheesed-off Helen sitting to one side while her fate is argued over by assorted heroes and goddesses. The women who feature in the stories, said Vicky Donnellan, the project curator, had in recent years become a focus for writers and artists who were \u201ctrying to uncover a new voice for the female experience in the world of male heroes\u201d. The stories still resonate, she said, because \u201cwe feel they are so packed with human experience \u2026 Even in the original Homeric stories, and in Virgil\u2019s version, and in the art of ancient Greece, these characters are portrayed with so much humanity, so much nuance and depth, that \u2026 they are amenable to interpretation through many different lenses.\u201d Troy: Myth and Reality opens at the British Museum on 21 November 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
