If peak Tiger Woods was the year 2000, nothing emphasised his dominance more than the battering of Pebble Beach into submission. A glance at the final leaderboard from the US Open of 19 years ago makes as staggering reading now as was ever the case: -12 T Woods, +3 M \u00c1 Jim\u00e9nez/E Els, +4 J Huston. Woods\u2019s worst round of the week was 71 in an event where seven over par was sufficient to earn a top-10 finish. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see a performance as dominant as that again,\u201d said Rory McIlroy of Woods\u2019s Pebble procession. Woods, now a 15-times major winner, need not necessarily draw upon 2000 as the US Open makes a return to the Monterey Peninsula from Thursday. The 43-year-old\u2019s success at the Masters in April supplied proof that he can still prevail on the greatest stages. Still, a degree of flashback is inevitable. That particular performance, which delivered Woods\u2019s third major win, was extraordinary even by the standards of a phenomenal sportsman. \u201cHe probably led the field in every single statistical category,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cI\u2019m sure he was up there in distance and driving accuracy. Pebble, 2000, he never drove the ball better than he did that year, long and straight. He had unbelievable distance control with his irons and he was holing putts. He did everything he needed to do. \u201cGolf can feel pretty easy when it\u2019s like that. Maybe not to that same level, I\u2019ve played tournaments and played well where the back nine has been comfortable and you\u2019ve been able to sort of let it sink in. But to win by 15? It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d Woods looked short of health and/or fitness when missing the cut at last month\u2019s US PGA Championship. The specifics of the Masters champion\u2019s scenario, typically, were shrouded in mystery; Woods admitted to illness on the day before the tournament began, as it curtailed his practice. His mood and form were improved by early June\u2019s Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied ninth. The scale of the achievement within view for Brooks Koepka is illustrated by the fact that a US Open treble was last completed in 1905, when Scotsman Willie Anderson won a third in a row. Koepka\u2019s victory at that US PGA Championship, at Bethpage Black, extended his superb run to four major wins inside 23 months. \u201cThat name [Anderson] has come up a lot this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m chasing or trying to accomplish. It\u2019s just another tournament. You can put some outside pressure on. It\u2019s a major championship. I\u2019ll be up for it, I know that. I enjoy a tough test of golf and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get at a US Open. You know that going in. It\u2019s fun to me to get on those big stages and try to win.\u201d Praise, hardly in short supply where Koepka is concerned, has been forthcoming from Woods. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to peak at the right time,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick and it\u2019s not easy to do. Brooks has done it better than anyone else over the last couple of years. \u201cHe knows what he needs to do and he seems to get his game, mind and body coming together for those big weeks. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all looking to have happen, but he\u2019s figured out what\u2019s best for him.\u201d Koepka\u2019s prediction of a stern challenge looks apt, with photography from recent days at Pebble Beach showing extremely dense rough. With that comes a premium on driving accuracy; as suits Koepka and McIlroy, if not, in theory, Woods. Nick Faldo branded the rough mega-thick with an added warning that this \u201cstifles the creativity\u201d of players. The USGA, beset by bad publicity in recent times in direct relation to the US Open, can barely afford another week of negativity. Pebble Beach was once Dustin Johnson territory. He won the AT&amp;T pro-am there in back-to-back years from 2010, long before he ended his major wait at the US Open of 2016. Not only has Johnson failed to kick on with \u2013 as was expected \u2013 further victories in the big four from there, he has recently redeveloped a tendency to claim defeat from the jaws of victory. In Johnson\u2019s defence, he at least provided a worthwhile Sunday challenge to Koepka at Bethpage as others waved white flags. \u201cThe fields are so deep nowadays that even with your really good golf, the game is very hard,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was alluding to the fact that Tiger winning by 15, that might be something we only ever see once in our lifetime.\u201d Which means there is all the more reason to reflect upon it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
