Hemmed in by a quivering slab of blue sea, this big, brash metropolis has it all. It's got the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge (or \"Coat hanger\" as it is affectionately known by locals), beautiful Bondi, Circular Quay and Darling Harbour. But once you've sussed out most of the major icons, met a few Speedo-clad surf lifesavers, caught the ferry to Manly, and had fish and chips at Coogee Beach, what's left to see and do? Ask any self-respecting local and they'll tell you: the list is endless. And the great thing is you don't have to travel too far outside your comfort zone to sample the best the city has to offer. In fact, some of the city's so-called hidden attractions are within an hour or so's drive from the chaos of the CBD. A good place to start your tour of the secret side to Sydney is at Bungan Beach, one of the city's beautiful northern beaches. Access to this beach is only possible by two steep walkways, which keeps the crowds to a minimum. In fact, in a city of some 5 million, you will usually find fewer than 20 people on this rugged beach at any one time and, like many Sydney beaches, if you get there at dawn (or early on a winter's morn) you will most likely have the entire beach to yourself. To get to Bungan, head north over the Harbour Bridge and allow about one hour's drive from the city. (Watchers of B-grade Aussie soaps might like to note that if you keep driving north you will get to the secluded peninsula that is Palm Beach, better known to Home &amp; Away audiences as Summer Bay.) Heading back towards the city you will find Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which is about 24km north of the CBD. The park has great cultural and spiritual significance for the local Aboriginal population as it covers part of the Guringai people's traditional lands. The park's best-known Aboriginal paintings are the ochre hand stencils at Red Hands Cave. There are more than 800 Aboriginal sites scattered throughout Ku-ring-gai and one set of rock carvings is said to depict a star chart tens of thousands of years old. With more than 100km of shoreline in the park, you should pop in to the Kalkari Visitor Centre, to pick up detailed walking maps of the area, or hire a rowing boat. In Waratah Park, on the fringes of Ku-ring-gai, you will see lyre birds, emus, koalas and kangaroos and other native animals in their natural habitat. And TV trivia types might also like to know that this is also where the 60s TV show Skippy the Bush Kangaroo was filmed. Though popular, the park is less likely to be overrun with the hordes that flock to Taronga Zoo. Ku-ring-gai and Waratah Park both have camping and barbecue facilities, as well as picnic tables. But if you want more of a castaway experience, take a trip to Clark Island, situated off the ritzy suburb of Double Bay. For a fee of just $5 (about \u00a32) per person - for up to 30 people - you can escape to your very own patch of secluded bushland and still be within a stone's throw of the city centre. If you really want to have the place to yourself you can hire the whole island for just $2,200 (about \u00a3870) a day. Contact the Cadman's Cottage Information Centre. Another secluded picnic spot with a million-dollar view is Parsley Bay in Vaucluse. Hidden among the back streets just 10km from the city you will find wonderful parkland and a lovely suspension bridge with a beautiful view. Parking is virtually non-existent so you should make a day of it and map out a route that criss-crosses to the bay from the city's Botanic Gardens. Before embarking on a picnic at one of the aforementioned sites, work in a trip to the Sydney fish markets. Here, you can either buy a prepared lunch or enrol in a hands-on course specialising in your favourite ethnic cuisine. Learn how to make tapas, sushi and paella or just delve into the fundamentals of a fair dinkum Aussie barbie. Evidence of Australia's abundant marine life can also be found at Manly Oceanworld, where you can don scuba gear and live dangerously by diving into a tank teeming with great nurse sharks, sea turtles, wobbegong sharks and moray eels. Margret Campbell and Dallas Dodd also offer a harbour experience of a different kind. The pair run Sydney Aboriginal Discoveries, a small Aboriginal family owned tour business where you can learn about bush tucker and take a walkabout tour that focuses on Australian history from an Aboriginal perspective. Travelling from Manly Cove, you can hire a suitably grizzled biker and his machine for a half day and see Sydney by Harley. One option is to head back over the Bridge and travel via the Eastern Suburbs beaches to La Perouse, then back to the city, Darling Harbour and The Rocks. One little-known part of Botany Bay National Park is La Perouse, named after the Comte de La Perouse, who arrived within a week of the British First Fleet in 1788. \"La Pah\", as the locals refer to it, is the site of first contact between the crew of James Cook's Endeavour and the country's original indigenous inhabitants. Beneath the honeycomb-coloured cliffs there are rich marine environments and remnants of the vegetation that Banks and Solander, Cook's botanists, first studied in 1770. Also located in the park is La Perouse Museum, where on Sundays and public holidays you can witness the Snake Man entertaining the crowds with his live reptile show. You might see a few snakes of a different kind if you decide to embark on a Destiny Tour, which offers visitors a glimpse of the city's filthy underbelly. Forget tour bus, think funeral hearse. Highlights of the tour, conducted in one of two 1960s cadillacs, include a trip to a bondage parlour, a guided ghost tour and an excursion down a few back alleys in the notoriously seedy King's Cross. If Sydney by Harley or hearse is not adventurous enough, think about a detour with a diva. No visit to Sydney is complete without an encounter with some of the city's jaunty drag queens. The Sydney by Diva tour is billed as being a tour of the city as seen through ros\u00e9-tinted glasses. Really, it's a three-hour luxury coach tour conducted by drag queens whose humour is, well, as camp as a row of pink tents. Best around the annual Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras. From gay times to gourmet safaris ... for foodies, Sydney has a lot to offer. But to find it, you must travel as far from tourist hotspots such as Circular Quay and The Rocks as you can. Though most visitors are told that Leichardt is the city's Little Italy, those in the know will direct you to the neighbouring suburb of Haberfield - home to two fresh pasta shops, Sydney's only fresh cheese shop and the best pizza outside Napoli (at Napoli in Bocca). And the district's main fruit shop sells luscious red tomatoes plucked fresh from a family garden. For a taste of Asia, take the juddering train to Cabramatta, which has a daily market. Depending on the season you will find exotic fruits such as red, hairy rambutans, crimson-coloured dragon fruit, black sapote (chocolate pudding fruit), fresh mangoes and more. You will also find restaurants serving the best spring rolls and roast duck in town. Finally, a must on any expos\u00e9 of the secret side to Sydney is a visit to Harry's Cafe de Wheels. Located on Cowper Wharf Road, Woolloomooloo, this unassuming pie cart has been here since the 30s. Here you can chomp on pies and peas or crumbed sausages while bonding with a bunch of beery, bleary-eyed blokes and sheilas. And if nothing else, it's a great place to learn local lingo such as \"pass the dead horse tomato sauce mate\".
