By the end of the year, one in every two British households will have a Harry Potter on the shelf. By yesterday, Rowling had sold 8,455,400 copies. In the unprecedented scale and prestige of her success, Bloomsbury has got far bigger and richer, too. Yet to some eyes in the publishing trade, astonishingly little else has changed inside its Soho Square headquarters in London. Yet the company's co-founder, Liz Calder, still lavishes her warmest tributes on Joanna Trollope - an author who stuck with her through the lean pre-Potter years - not on Rowling herself. In June 1997, the month Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came out, Bloomsbury was strong on literary novels. It was fresh from winning the Orange prize for fiction and had another title on the shortlist. This month it had four titles on the Orange longlist, plus the runner-up for the prize, Donna Tartt's The Little Friend. In the company's alphabetical list of its 200 authors, Rowling's lustre makes the names around her look like nonentities. The others in the list's \"R\" section are Dorit Rabinyan, Lou Reed, Janet Reibstein, Bruce Robinson, Anne Roiphe, Colette Rossant and Virginia Rounding. Apart from Reed, none of them are remotely household names like Rowling. Yet, on close inspection, they are mostly authors that many publishers would be happy to list as actual or potential moneyspinners. Reed is the Velvet Underground songwriter, Robinson director of Withnail and I. Reibstein and Roiphe write marital counselling books, Rossant is a food writer. Rabinyan is an Israeli novelist. Rounding has begun to make waves among reviewers this month with her highly marketable, \"thought-provoking\" Les Grandes Horizontales, about historic French courtesans. Below them is Ben Schott, whose Schott's Miscellany was last Christmas's bestselling stockingfiller. He has sold 330,000 copies. Slightly below him in the alphabet is Donna Tartt, whose The Little Friend has sold 200,000 in hardback. These, like Rowling, contribute a less publicised slice of the \u00a316m moneypile Bloomsbury has in the bank. Rowling's sales are remarkable, but not as unique as the trade hype suggests. The first Harry Potter, The Philosopher's Stone, has sold 2,534,993 UK copies - mostly paperback - in six years, according to Nielsen BookScan figures. In 1944, the golden age of reading, Somerset Maugham's novel The Razor's Edge sold 3m hardback copies in its first year. A distant warning that Rowling, like Maugham, will eventually be supplanted by rivals comes with the book chain Ottakar's decision to choose as its book of the month not The Order of the Phoenix, but GP Taylor's Shadowmancer. Rowling herself today indicated the pressure she has come under due to her success. In an interview in The Times she revealed that she tried to give back an advance on one of the Potter books. She said: \"I wasn't coping. I wasn't coping at all.\" Faber and Faber's reported five or six-figure advance for this medium-quality Christian fantasy story, originally self-published by an Anglican vicar, is a tribute to the Rowling phenomenon. But Bloomsbury's own respected children's list has not followed this formula. \"They did not make the mistake of publishing more of the same,\" a trade specialist said. Instead, they published a polar opposite to Harry Potter, Louis Sachar's Holes, regarded as one of the most original stories of the decade. The financial transformation wrought by Potter revenue is reflected in this month's consensus of stockbroker recommendations for investors on Bloomsbury covering this year and next year. These are speckled with the advice \"buy\" and \"outperform\", meaning that the company is expected to outperform forecasts for both years. In 1995, Bloomsbury lost \u00a3391,000. But, when Harry Potter came along two years later, it was recovering, through successes such as David Guterson's Snow Falling Among Cedars. This year, brokers expect pretax profits of \u00a313.5m and an \u00a38 dividend to shareholders. Next year - with Order of the Phoenix profits rolling - they forecast \u00a315.1m profits and a dividend of nearly \u00a39. Focused Despite this moneypile, Bloomsbury is said to \"avoid bidding foolishly\" in auctions for book rights. Often, to the disappointment and surprise of literary agents, it is more cautious than publishers with shallower pockets. The downside is that it is not notable for investing in unknown talent and trying to develop it. When the publisher's co-founder and chairman Nigel Newton betrays excitement, it is most often about typical Muggle-style activities: acquisitions and building \"branded databases\" in electronic business information, dictionaries and English language teaching. Bloomsbury bought Whitaker's Almanack, the dictionary and language publisher Peter Collin, and A&amp;C Black, publishers of Who's Who. After digitising all 30,000 Who's Who entries, it has licensed them to business information giant Bloomberg. Yesterday, Bloomsbury was too busy with the hype for the new Rowling to discuss its corporate evolution. To outsiders, it looks like a company focused on growing methodically, and on continuing to do mostly what it has always done, helped by the continuity of having Calder and Newton at the top for 18 years. \"They are supremely uncorrupted by their success,\" one outsider said.
