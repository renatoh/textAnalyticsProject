Well, at least as much rooted in reality as it is possible to be when talking about evening dresses costing more than \u00a310,000. Her collection was named \u201cAthletic Couture\u201d and featured dresses with ergonomic lines which traced the models\u2019 curves, harness straps and white ski pants and matching zip tops highlighted with orange go-faster stripes all of which could loosely be termed sporty. Before the show the designer said: \u201cI was thinking about women at their most focused and dynamic \u2026 women who push themselves to the limit.\u201d Dreams and magic, rather than focus and dynamism, are the more usual vernacular of couture. But this collection tapped into the modern trend of \u201cath-evening\u201d \u2013 wearing posh tracksuit bottoms with high heels or shoulder baring tops with racer backs which recall performance sportswear, to a swanky evening event. It\u2019s a concept which rejects the fusty notion that a gilt edged invitation demands the kneejerk response of a floor length, cocktail dress. That feels a bit too Nancy Reagan-era White House for now. In this context it was refreshing to see a designer using current trends to influence even the highest levels of a brand\u2019s design repertoire. It was a move that younger couture customers \u2013 looking for something that little bit more relevant \u2013 will appreciate. So much about the world of haute couture celebrates the past. Dresses as weighed down with an over-reverance to the history of les petits mains and the workmanship of the ateliers as they are with bugle beads and crystals. Much of the big names on couture schedule are designed by men \u2013 the world of couture can feel very backward sometimes. But Donatella\u2019s Versace is different. In couture terms the brand is an ariviste (it rejoined the couture rosta only four years ago). What is more the designer\u2019s approach feels modern and open. The Versace family has been no stranger to scandals in the past but Donatella\u2019s Versace is one where knowing irony lives happily alongside high glamour and sexually charged designs. Look up her Instagram account if you are unconvinced. The designer herself was at pains to highlight Versace\u2019s modern point of difference. She noted that \u201ccouture is not about the past, it is a living tradition.\u201d To emphasis this still further the designer had used silicone gel throughout the collection \u2013 a forward-thinking kind of couture decoration which looked as if a spirograph had been involved. Chunky crystal ropes (which recalled those sugary shoelace sweets) were knotted and threaded in and out of evening gowns. Flashes of highlighter orange and neon yellow \u2013 the sort of colours seen on performance trainers \u2013 were a motif throughout the show. There was a catsuit with ski-pant stirrups and a white evening gown which looked as if a neon yellow swimsuit was worn underneath. Dynamism, strength and athleticism may have been the starting point, but there was plenty of femininity too. Supermodels dressed in cobalt blue and acid tangerine dresses wearing four inch heels can never really be accurately described as looking ready to compete in track and field. The couture levels of craftsmanship and technical accomplishment of the atelier were also keen to be highlighted by the Versace team \u2013 journalists were briefed that one crochet dress took a month to complete. Summing up the show the designer said: \u201cThis collection is one of the most complicated, sophisticated and technically accomplished that we have ever created.\u201d Like the evening wear design her clients will likely lap up, Donatella Versace is not about modesty. Nor should she, or they, be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
