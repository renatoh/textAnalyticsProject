Walker Books \u00a39.99/\u00a36.99 (pbk), pp267 Incantation by Alice Hoffman Egmont. \u00a35.99, pp168 I From Jeanette Winterson and Carl Hiaasen to Madonna and Paul McCartney, there is a burgeoning list of novelists - and celebrities who are not writers - turning their hands to children's literature. It is hard to guess to what extent the JK Rowling factor is at work. I don't mean to suggest mercenary opportunism. But I wonder whether those who swerve towards children's fiction are gambling with themselves, driven by the hope that, like JK, they might find the key to every child's heart and hit the mysterious jackpot. We will have to wait until September before decoding a great boulder of a book by Joanne Harris, set '500 years after the end of the world (though its title, Runemarks, is enough to send me running, calling for chocolate). I must at this point confess to a blind spot about novels set in the future. This makes me an imperfect reader for Tim Lott's Fearless, published in two editions (in the manner of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time). Lott describes it as a 'contemporary parable' in the tradition of Animal Farm. I found it more Kafkaesque than Orwellian. It is so hard, unless you are a virtuoso such as Margaret Atwood, to create brave new worlds. Lott has dreamt up a totalitarian world in which children are taken hostage and put in an evil penitentiary (the public is duped into believing it to be an enlightened 'City Community Faith School'). Lott's heroine, Fearless, has one brown eye and one blue - and more courage than character. It is her task to escape and expose the evil she and her friends are suffering. She makes her gallant exit by hiding from the institute in a rubbish lorry. And it is clear there is nothing she will not sacrifice for truth. Lott writes so well that I wondered why I was so underwhelmed. It is hard to do allegory involvingly. There are theatrical climaxes but the story is emotionally disengaged; it's thin, cold. I did not believe in Little Fearless herself. Nor did I see it as a clear mirror to any contemporary plight. Although I liked Fearless's transporting of tears-in-a-bottle as a proof of the wretchedness of her comrades, I was never moved to add to the bottle. From the start, I was making excuses to try to escape its prison and all its shades of grey. But children are made of sterner stuff. It will be interesting to see whether the book takes off. Alice Hoffman is a bestselling novelist for adults. Incantation is her third book for children. I've read a handful of her adult novels and am amazed that this trumps them all. Adults should wrench it from the grip of any teenager canny enough to have got hold of a copy. It is an extraordinary performance. Its title is just right - it is almost a song. And in the way that you can't interrupt a song, you cannot stop reading this book until the end. After Fearless, it was like a switch of seasons, from winter to full summer. But this is no summer holiday. It is set at the time of the Spanish Inquisition and it tells the story of a Jewish family living as Catholics to protect themselves. The novel has Spain in its bloodstream and its sultry beauty and sense of impending tragedy reminded me of Lorca's poetry. It is also the study of a friendship between two girls that founders horribly, a personal betrayal that becomes a public terror. It is so moving that you could fill a jar of tears almost without noticing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
