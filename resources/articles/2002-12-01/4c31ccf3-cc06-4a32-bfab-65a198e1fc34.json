The Uefa technical director Andy Roxburgh told a seminar for coaches and teachers in Ipswich yesterday that though the European game's governing body could not stop teams fielding foreign players, it hoped to reach agreement whereby clubs had to keep a certain quota of home-grown players in their sides. \"We cannot by European law prevent clubs from playing a certain amount of players from abroad but we are looking at implementing a rule whereby 50% of a team on the pitch has to be home-grown,\" he said. \"That means they will have to come through the club's own academy-youth system. \"That would ensure young talent, for example in England, would be allowed to flourish and that in turn would also help countries develop their national teams. \"Coaches like Marcello Lippi at Juventus, for example, endeavour to ensure that at least half his team comes from the local region in Italy.\" Uefa's spokesman Mike Lee said it was unlikely anything would happen in the short term and there were three possibilities on quotas - \"through the first-team squad, the squad named on a match day, or the players on the pitch. In an ideal world you would go for the players on the pitch.\" \u00b7 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has urged the game's governing bodies to harmonise the world calendar and avoid the continual clash between clubs and countries. Arsenal's manager often loses players such as Nwankwo Kanu and Gilberto Silva for internationals, and had to rest Silva several times after appearances for Brazil. France's Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira claimed they felt tired as early as September. \"At the moment there is a big conflict,\" said Wenger. \"We feel we pay big money to the players and we have to rest them because they come back tired. \"We have to change and harmonise the fixtures, reorganise all the fixtures for January to December. We would start everybody at exactly the same time. If we don't do that we will always have the same problem.\" At present the World Cup and European Championship usually start in early June. But Wenger said: \"We could play the World Cup in December and we can play other internationals around it [the new calendar]\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
