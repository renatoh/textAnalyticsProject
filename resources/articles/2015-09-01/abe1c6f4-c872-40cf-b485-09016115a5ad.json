With Newcastle second bottom of the Premier League, out of the Capital One Cup and about to face Chelsea, Wijnaldum was asked what needs to change. \u201cI think the attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must stay positive because if we don\u2019t it is going to go wrong. We need men now out on the field. \u201cOn top of that I think we must play free. Sometimes I have the idea that we play with a lot of pressure on us because the results are not going well, but we must play free because then it is going to get better.\u201d Wijnaldum, signed for \u00a315m from PSV Eindhoven, where he won the title last season, said the transition was \u201creally hard\u201d and added that he would like to play further forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
