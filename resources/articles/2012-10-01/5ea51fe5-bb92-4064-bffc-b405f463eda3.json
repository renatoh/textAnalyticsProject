However, if you are going to be retro, then Prince is the way to go to, rather than the dried-out, skinny-trousered, classic rock so drearily retrodden by the rest of the landfill. Arising from an aqueous swirl of fizzy, colourised funk-ade, Ill Fit elegantly springs taut and cuts loose, the falsetto vocals tremulous and restrained, its faintly distressed surfaces offering subtle hints of hindsight to a perfect funk-pop age. Teetering on sublime. Peace Bloodshake (Columbia) There are shades of the criminally overlooked band the Invisible about Bloodshake, taken from Birmingham lot's Delicious EP. The video sees them free-floating in a neo-neo-psychedelic Photoshopped starswirl. The vocals are mildly tranquilised, the guitars a splashy interplay of white liquid, but this is anti-shoegaze, driven by a rambunctious, gatecrashing energy, coming at you like a bucket of water. Peace do not bring peace. They've come a long way from their lo-fi origins and are breaking out in a direction you wish more would follow. Jessie Ware Night Light (PMR) Jessie Ware has been touted as a diva in the making, and her vocals are rich and lucid, but free of the sort of gymnastic gurgling nowadays considered to denote \"soul\". She's got leftfield credentials, too, working with Dave Okumu of the Invisible (them again), who adds a certain oblique shimmer to Night Light. All that she's got to be wary of is being sucked into an MOR vortex of dry ice, Heart FM and Celine Dion-ification. AxeWound Exorchrist (Search And Destroy) Fascinating stuff from the British-Canadian metal \"supergroup\", AxeWound. This was once death metal, you suspect, before being subjected to intensive dilution. The plastic rat swung by the blonde female in the video as she sits amid a mass of candles signifies how utterly sanitised this Satanism is. For all its volume and sweat, it's as odourless and ultimately as chaste as mainstream Christian rock. Tyga Feat Chris Brown &amp; Wynter Gordon For The Fame (Young Money/Cash Money) Tyga stands for \"Thank You God Always\", the little creep. For The Fame, with its cliched stabs of synth strings, 10-times refried electro backbeat and general \"coming to the top deck of a bus near you soon\" tinniness is nondescript enough. It does, however, involve Chris Brown. Let's hope that nothing comes out about Brown to ruin his currently spotless reputation and make us wonder why he has been heaped with riches and fame despite being an obviously, appallingly obnoxious dick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
