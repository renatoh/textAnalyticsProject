Barr, who came out of the stand-up comedy world, was the show's matriarch throughout its nine year run on network television. She has now returned to the stand-up comedy circuit and progressive radio work. She has become politically active against the war in Iraq and as an advocate for ordinary working class Americans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
