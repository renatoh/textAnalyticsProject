In a statement, the League One club said that Sadler had bought 96.2% of the club shares, the Bloomfield Road stadium, which was in a separate company, the club\u2019s training ground and the hotel at the ground. Sadler, described as a successful hedge fund manager in Hong Kong, was born and grew up in Blackpool, and is a lifelong supporter of the club, the statement said. He is the chief investment officer of a finance business he founded in 2007, Segantii Capital Management, which describes itself as \u201can institutional asset management firm\u201d which \u201cpredominantly focuses on investing in Asian securities\u201d. The price paid by Sadler is thought to have been around \u00a310m, which will go to the receivers, Paul Cooper and David Rubin. They were appointed by the high court in February to take over all Oyston\u2019s assets including the football club, and recoup \u00a322m still owing to the Latvian banker Valeri Belokon, who won a \u00a331m judgment against Oyston in November 2017. That judgment found that Oyston had \u201cillegitimately stripped\u201d the club of \u00a326.77m after the club\u2019s promotion in 2010 for a single season in the Premier League, including \u00a311m paid to one of Oyston\u2019s companies which had been described as a director\u2019s salary. Blackpool supporters had mounted a well-observed boycott of home matches for years in protest at Oyston\u2019s ownership, as by 2016, following the failure to invest the Premier League bonanza in strengthening the squad, the club were relegated all the way to League Two. The high court judgment ordered Oyston to pay the same amount as he stripped, \u00a326.77m, to Belokon, and to buy out Belokon\u2019s original \u00a34.5m investment in the club, making the \u00a331m total. Oyston paid Belokon an initial \u00a310m, but still owed, with interest, \u00a322m, when Belokon applied for receivers to be appointed to sell the assets and recover the money for him. Belokon could not take over the club because he was barred under the EFL\u2019s owners and directors \u201cfit and proper person\u201d test, due to a conviction in Kyrgyzstan in 2017 for multimillion-dollar money laundering. In February 2017 Belokon lost a hearing at the Paris court of appeal, which found that he had taken over the Manas bank in Kyrgyzstan \u201cin order to develop \u2026 money-laundering practices\u201d. Belokon denounced the Kyrgyz conviction as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d, claiming it \u201cignored the most basic principles of natural justice\u201d. In the statement, Sadler said it was a \u201cgreat honour and privilege\u201d to take over the club and he intended to provide \u201cfinancial stability and investment over time\u201d. A long-term friend and fellow supporter, Brett Gerrity, a local solicitor, is joining the board. Tim Fielding, honorary vice-president of the Blackpool supporters\u2019 trust, who was one of the leading campaigners against the Oyston regime and was sued by Owen Oyston for comments he made, has been given a formal role as adviser to the board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
