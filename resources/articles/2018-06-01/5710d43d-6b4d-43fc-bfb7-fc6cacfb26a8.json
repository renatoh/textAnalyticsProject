The jaw-dropping 481 for six from 50 overs by England was powered by centuries from Alex Hales and Jonny Bairstow and surpassed the 444 for three made on the same ground against Pakistan in 2016. Tim Paine\u2019s beleaguered tourists then crumbled to 239 all out for their heaviest one-day defeat by runs and England\u2019s biggest. Morgan, who has led England from their harrowing World Cup campaign in 2015 to the dizzying heights of the No 1 side in the world, and now seen back-to-back series wins over Australia this year sewn up by their current 3-0 lead, is not a character prone to hyperbole but even he could not play down this remarkable performance. \u201cIt is the best, definitely,\u201d said Morgan, having himself struck a 21-ball half-century from No 5 to claim another English record. \u201cWhat is most pleasing is the level of intensity we operated at throughout the whole game. Whoever came in, every bowler who came on, showed unbelievable energy, which is all you can ask. \u201cThe players are obviously proud of what they\u2019ve achieved but certainly this is the best period of my career and the proudest as well.\u201d Paine, who is leading a broken Australian side that is still reeling from the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa and lacking five first-team players through suspension or injury, was understandably at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been playing cricket since I was a kid, and that was the hardest day\u2019s cricket of my life. You take your hat off, England struck the ball as well as I\u2019ve ever seen. We just ran into some guys who are absolutely red hot at the moment and put us to the sword.\u201d England\u2019s dominance was perhaps summed up by Hales. While Bairstow made it four hundreds in six innings with his 139 from 92 balls, the 147 from 92 struck by the Nottinghamshire man at No 3 shows the assets at Morgan\u2019s disposal, given he will likely make way when Ben Stokes is fit again. Hales said: \u201cWhat a ground! We\u2019ve had some great memories here as a team and today is another special day. \u201cMy plan was just to keep the momentum going. I know the ground like the back of my hand so it was nice to do something special.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
