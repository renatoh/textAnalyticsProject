Ah, the magic of the Cup, eh? Eh, Arsenal fans? Hello? Hel-lo-oh? There's no one there. For the first time in living memory, Old Trafford will not be chock-full of southern football fans. And that's because many of the Arsenal faithful will not be able to make Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United due to the complete suspension of train services from London. So they'll have to make do with watching it on the telly. A telly at a service station on the M6, where road works are threatening to cause further traffic chaos. Still, it's not dampening the Fiver's excitement. We have not been this pumped since we found that Swedish contraption under Uncle Fiver's bed. And with the possibility of two clubs from outside the top flight contesting an FA Cup final for the first time since, erm, 1202BC, you can understand why. Sadly, wee Gord St Rachan, whose Southampton side take on Watford in Sunday's other semi at Villa Park, was not as pleased to see us as we were to see him. \"You can enjoy going to the cinema! You can enjoy going for a night out! You can enjoy going out for a meal! But football!?\" screamed wee Gord, as the Fiver's joy visibly waned. \"You've got to win the game! The enjoyment comes after a win. It's very unusual if you can play a game of football and run about going, 'this is great fun, I'm loving this'. It has got to be won.\" You don't need to tell that to Sheffield United's players, though, who are more than fired up to take on Arsenal, especially with hapless Dave Seaman rumoured to be back in goal to make his 1,000th professional appearance. \"If you see a few of our players crowding round one player you will know who it is,\" snarled Blade runner Michael Tonge. But not to tackle him. Oh no, to get his shirt at the end of the match. \"I'd like to swap shirts with Patrick Vieira. He is one of my favourite Arsenal players,\" smiled Tonge, lovingly fingering a picture he keeps of the Gunners captain in his wallet. \"But I think there are a few other players who will want his shirt too. There might be a bit of a scramble to get the shirt off his back at the end of the game.\" Oh yes, you can't accuse those Sheffield United lads of treating this as just a nice day out! * * * * * * * * * * * * TORA TORA TORA To paraphrase a line from some Hollywood blockbuster or other, just because you're a paranoid Hammer, it doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Stand outside the cockneys' training complex today, and that's the mantra you'll hear the entire firstteam chanting, TJ Hooker-style. Just 48 hours ago, Fredi Kanoute looked over both shoulders and behind the curtains before rubbishing his own quotes which claimed he wanted to leave the 'ammers. Someone had made them up to discredit him, he cried. And today, after the tabloid snipes concocted a ridiculous West-Ham-to-shave-\u00a310m-off-their-wage-bill-even-if-the-stay-up rumour, the club has had to make like an ageing hippie who's guzzled too much acid. \"These rumours are unfounded as far as I'm concerned,\" snorted an incredulous and irate-looking Glenn Roeder today, though his ire was more likely down to the pure Sarsons hit coursing through his veins. \"The club is run very well, business-wise,\" he added, passing both hymn sheet and buck over to the club's book-balancing MD, Paul Aldridge. \"We have no plans to dramatically change the wage structure,\" he chimed, smartly side-stepping the fact that despite being the sixth-highest Premiership payers the club is nose-diving towards the First Division quicker than a Japanese fighter pilot with a chip on his shoulder. Unlike at Leeds United, however, where Publicity Pete's long-lingering legacy means Paul Robinson can be your own personal Wyclef for just \u00a37.5m, all remains healthy in the Upton Park garden. The likes of Paolo, Fredi and \u00a335,000-a-week liability Lee Bowyer can sleep easier tonight, for although their contracts expire this summer, with business skills borrowed from the Business The Enron Way handbook, there's every chance a juicy new deal will be on the cards. \"All our thoughts are concentrated on making sure we survive in the Premiership,\" griped a reddening Roeder, digging a marrow-shaped hole in the sand in which to bury his head. \"There is a big belief amongst everyone at the club that we will do that.\" That's the way, chaps, ignore the problem and it just might go away. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I was very impressed with Real Madrid. I believe Liverpool are capable of playing that kind of football\" - Beyond Satire with Jerzy Dudek. * * * * * * * * * * * * THIS MORNING WITH JOHN HARTSON 1. Wake up. Brush hair (off pillow and into bin). 2. Think of the lovely slap-up breakfast you're about to rustle up. Allow yourself to be carried down the stairs and into the kitchen on the crest of a wave of unctuous drool - and get cooking. 3. Violently smash egg after egg on co-ordinated worktop while muttering dark thoughts about referee Frank de Bleeckere, who officiated last night's Euro Vase semi-final draw between Celtic and Boavista. 4. Tenderise rashers of bacon by pounding them with your big fists as you explain: \"I don't know where those three minutes of injury time from the referee came from. There must be half-a-dozen times that their players have thrown themselves down and stayed down - that's just 12 minutes there, so it makes a mockery of that rule.\" 5. Angrily swallow a whole string of raw sausages with a series of glottal gulps before announcing: \"The first time they go down you want the referee then to go over and tell them to get off the floor. When the referee isn't strong, then it can ruin the game and it can become a bit of a farce.\" 6. Hack up a ball of skin and gristle. It might be best to calm down at this point. Try to remind yourself of better times by squeezing your torso into a Wales Kappa shirt. 7. After 15 minutes of brave but ultimately futile struggle, put the lycra top to one side with a spent sigh, and go back to bed. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Sir Alex Fergie shares Steve McClaren's fancy for Real Madrid's Geremi, so plans to usurp his old mucca with an \u00a38m or \u00a39m bid. Which is worse for Boro fans, the previous rumour, or the one linking them with a \u00a35m move for downsized Sunderland striker Kevin Philips? And at \u00a312m, Arsene Wenger can't afford Chelsea's of Chelsea defender John Terry, so he'll accept the \u00a37.5m second-best option that is William Gallas. A clause in his contract makes him available if Arsene flashes the cash. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Robert Pires will miss Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United on Sunday and the crucial Premiership game against Manchester United next week with an ankle injury. Rangers manager Alex McLeish has refused to support Celtic's bid to switch the date of the last Glasgow derby of the season - a match that seems likely to decide who wins the league title. Celtic are furious that the Ibrox fixture has been set for April 27, just three days after they face Boavista in their Euro Vase semi-final second leg. But McLeish said: \"I hope that some day Rangers can be in the same position and that's all I'm going to say on it.\" Alan Shearer believes that beating Manchester United tomorrow would put Newcastle United back in the Premiership title race. \"Nobody knows just where we are going to finish in the Premiership table,\" he told Newcastle's Evening Chronicle today. \"We have just got to keep on playing and if we beat Manchester United then things could be wide open again.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: World Football (4am) The lovely Charlotte is not happy, and it has nothing to do with the fact that when she walks back up the aisle with Tom in June, she'll be known as Mrs Paternoster. No, Charlotte's misery stems from your first-dance suggestions, based exclusively on rampant misogyny. Such as Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter. And AC/DC's Let Me Put My Love Into You. Sky Sports 1: Premier League Preview (5.30pm &amp; 11.30pm) \"She'd like some songs about a lass ripping her blokes knackers off or somesuch,\" revealed Tom yesterday, opening the floodgates to another email tsunami, which included the following suggestions. Soccer AM's All Sports Show (6pm &amp; 10pm) \"How about Tom and Charlotte do the old foxtrot to Joe Jackson's Is She Really Going Out With Him?\" wonders Stuart Rudge, misjudging the severity of the situation somewhat. The Full SP (7pm, 11pm &amp; 5am) Somewhat closer to the bone, Gareth Mytton casts aspersions by suggesting Short Dick Man, a slice of self-explanatory dance dirge from Gillette and 20 Fingers. You'll find it in the Where Are They Now? file. Live Football League (7.30pm) \"Perhaps Tom could sing to Charlotte,\" ponders Chris Facey, suggesting a romantic depth so rare in most men these days. But then the gloves come off, and he lobs Dennis Leary's I'm An A*****e into the ring. FA Cup Classics (12am) One Minute Man, suggests James Braybrook and several others, a suggestion almost as popular but nowhere as blunt as the Dead Kennedy's Too Drunk To F***, which James Walker thinks would give Charlotte a nice taste of what awaits her most evenings as a married woman. New York lesbian hardcore punkers Iron Flaps released a ditty along the same lines, chirps Ben Ray, and he thinks it might just \"bring the house down\". Sky Sports 2: Soccer AM's All Sports (1am) As might Kelis' Caught Out There, cries Paul McGory. \"With its catchy chorus of 'I hate you so much right now', followed by the maniacal scream of a woman with too much All Bran and omelette in her diet, it should do the trick.\" The Full SP (2am) Indeed it should, Paul, indeed it should. Tom Hall, however, prefers You Suck, which you almost certainly won't remember as the sole release of the, wait for it, Yeastie Girls. Clever, and odd that they too sank without trace. Premier League Preview (2.30am) \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For might be nice,\" says Ralph Shepperd, and it's safe to say that Tom's character has been finally gunned down by a shadowy man on a grassy knoll. FA Cup Classics (5.30am) But just to rub his nose in it, the best of the bunch by some way comes courtesy of the resourceful Gary McGuinness. He reveals that If I Shot You When I Met You I'd Be Out Of Jail By Now was recorded not, as we assumed, by a man, but by country crone Kasey Jones, a woman with issues. Radio 5 Live: Sport on 5 with Ian Payne (7pm) Having researched further, Gary delivers a veritable feast of suitable and unsuitable aural possibilities from Jones's back catalogue. You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly, for one, and (If They Can Send A Man To The Moon) Why Can't They Send 'Em All? for another. TalkSport: Football First (7pm) \"Might I suggest that Tom and Charlotte go that little bit further by trying to hire Kasey for their wedding?\" concludes Gary, taking the words right out of the Fiver's mouth. Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Until we hear Tom and Charlotte cry \"stop\", or at least agree to Gary McGuinness's suggestion, we're keeping this beast alive. So send your songs to the.boss@theguardian.com and together we can do our best to ruin the couple's happy day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
