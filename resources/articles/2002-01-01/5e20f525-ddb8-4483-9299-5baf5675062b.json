Staying up until the early hours was, of course, never a problem for me and I definitely wanted to see that one. There was so much hype and excitement about that fight that it captured the imagination of everyone. So I was delighted when a Manchester bookmaker friend of mine called Selwyn Demmy organised a party which ended with us watching the fight at a cinema. Clay, as he was then, was a cocky young kid and everyone expected him to be annihilated by Liston. But, as soon as the fight started, it was obvious that we were watching someone special, a youngster with total belief in himself and with great ability. As a young sportsman who was just beginning to make a name for himself, I could appreciate what he did a bit more than most and was totally thrilled by it. I loved his showmanship before the fight and in the ring because to me sport has always been both theatre and showmanship. To do what Ali did that night, you had to have total belief in yourself and it was wonderful to watch him demonstrate that. I was later honoured to meet Ali when he came to Manchester and a pal of mine called Tommy Tarbuck acted as his minder. The funny thing was that Tommy was only five feet nothing but then Ali did not need much protecting.\" John Surtees, 68, won the formula one world championship in 1964 and is still the only man to win world titles on two and four wheels \"I remember the fight vividly because I was driving for Ferrari at the time and preparing for what would turn out to be the year I won the formula one drivers' world championship. I'd always kept a little interest in boxing, partly because I'd always been keen on all sports and partly because I was following on from my father who'd taken part in boxing tournaments when he was in the army. Ali was a superb sportsman and a fine performer but against him Liston was also a formidable hunk of fighting machine. Perhaps Liston was slightly unlucky because usually, just as in motor racing, a good big 'un will usually beat a good little 'un. That epic fight was at the start of a truly memorable season for me because, although Ferrari carried me to the title, we always had the problem of concentrating on the team's sports car programme until the Le Mans 24-hour race in June, after which all the resources were piled into formula one in an effort to catch up the others who had been scoring strongly from the start of the year. But I do remember the sense of expectation over the Ali/Liston fight. It was unquestionably one of the most talked about events of the year. Ali was an inspirational figure, yet I believe the way he has handled himself in later years since being stricken with that terrible illness has been even more inspirational than during his sporting career.\" Ted Dexter, 66, was at the peak of his powers in 1964. He captained England against Australia that year and led Sussex to victory in the Gillette Cup at Lord's \"It was an Ashes year, which rather focused the mind, but I clearly remember the time he beat Sonny Liston. He had a lot to say for himself, I remember, but even the experts didn't give him much of a chance against Liston, who seemed such a formidable champion. It made everyone sit up and take notice. I don't think I quite realised how big Ali, or Cassius Clay as we knew him then, would become. But I do remember thinking that something unusual and somebody very special had arrived on the scene. I think most of us felt the same way. This was someone who would brighten up the sport. You have to remember that fight nights - even ones as big as this - were not as accessible in those days. There was no live showing. America seemed a very long way away. But I did watch the highlights. And Ali did everything he said he would. I will never forget the time I met him. It was in 1966, the year of his second meeting with Henry Cooper in London. I had retired from cricket the previous year - for a while - and a friend took me along to meet the great man. He took me to this quiet, dark room. What struck me was the vast size and impressive softness of the man. And that huge right mit when we shook hands. He was just a magnificent athlete. He was so gentle and softly spoken that it was difficult to imagine a greater contrast with the big-mouth public image. I remember thinking to myself at the time that this was not just a great boxer but one very clever guy.\" Tony Nash, 65, and Robin Dixon, 67, made up the two-man bobsleigh team which won gold at the Winter Olympics at Innsbruck in 1964 Tony Nash : \"We had only just got back from the Olympics and we really didn't have much time to ourselves, we were being wined and dined all over the place and, though I followed boxing, I didn't have a chance to see the fight. All I remember was a fit, young Olympian fighting an old warrior. Liston had the reputation as a bit of a thug but Clay was a beautiful fighter.\" Robin Dixon (now Lord Glentoran): \"I was in the army and, when we got back from Austria, I was immediately sent off on duty for a tour of Borneo, so while Tony was being wined and dined I was in the jungle. Therefore I don't remember the Liston fight but I did see the footage of his Olympic victories in 1960 many times. I admired him hugely, his arrogance and athleticism made him quite unlike any other heavyweight boxer there's ever been.\" New Zealander Peter Snell, 63, defended his 800m Olympic title in Tokyo in 1964 and doubled up to claim the 1500m gold. He now lives in Texas \"I've never been a huge fan of boxing; it's always seemed a brutal business. Nor have I ever been a great admirer of Muhammad Ali and I think it's totally inappropriate that he gets all the attention he does, and there really is a huge amount of it over here. I think a lot of it is media driven and there's even a film now with Will Smith in and that's getting a lot of exposure too. I know it's not going to make me the most popular person but I just don't think he was the best boxer. Just look at the record of Joe Louis and I don't think Ali's compares. It was the mind games that put me off. It's not a style that I admire. I like to deal in the purity of performance, let the physical achievements speak for themselves. Of course, that's easier in athletics where the runner who runs fastest wins. Not that I could win much these days. Somewhere around the age of 59 or 60, running gets more difficult. These days I'm addicted to orienteering.\" \u00b7 Interviews: Roy Collins, Alan Henry, Paul Weaver and Pete Nichols"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
