An eight-runner field with a hot favourite is what bookmakers refer to as a \"filthy\" each-way race, offering value to those who look beyond the market leader, and there will be many backers this weekend who decide that Youmzain each-way is the best bet. Mick Channon's four-year-old is an 8-1 chance in places for the King George, but he has some useful form in the book, including a length-and-a-half defeat by Dylan Thomas, the ante-post favourite for Saturday's race, at Leopardstown last year, and a narrow defeat by Rail Link, the subsequent Arc winner. \"He's a high-class horse and he always has been,\" Channon said yesterday, \"and he's only had 13 races, so we haven't overdone him. He ran very well in Dubai over the winter as well, and we've always wanted to have a go at a race like this with him. \"I don't make the books so I don't know about the odds, but he breezed lovely this morning and he seems in great form. He's going there with a great chance.\" Youmzain was below his best when fifth of six behind Mountain High in the Grand Prix de St Cloud last time out, though Jamie Spencer reported afterwards that the colt had slipped on the first bend and was never travelling from that point. Overall, though, Youmzain's form shows great consistency. He has been placed in eight of his 10 races over the past two seasons, his four victories including the Group One Preis von Europa at Cologne. \"He's a Group One winner and his form stands up,\" Channon says. \"People keep saying that this is a sub-standard King George, but you can only beat the best horses that are around at this moment in time. \"He's not short of speed either, so I'm not too worried about the pace in the race. So long as there's pace on from three furlongs out, he'll be fine, as he's got a real bit of class about him. \"We've won a lot of big races, but obviously this would be the biggest if he could win on Saturday. It's great that we've got a horse good enough to have a go and we're going there very hopeful.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Jawaaneb 2.35 Lingfield Hazy Days may attract considerable interest here but, with her stable not firing in the winners with its usual regularity, it might pay to take on Sir Mark Prescott's filly. Jawaaneb has solid form and showed she was going the right way when touched off by Tranquilizer over this course and distance last time. Successful in soft ground at Warwick before that, she should have more to offer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
