Multiple media reports described a chaotic scene on Lake Travis, near the state capital of Austin, when a procession of boats waving Trump flags and banners motored over the waters but then got into potentially serious trouble. Videos of the event circulating on social media showed several boats being swamped by waves and sinking as frantic passengers jumped into the water. The Travis county sheriff\u2019s office received its first call for help related to the event just after noon and multiple agencies quickly moved to assist people. So far, no injuries have been reported, according to the New York Times. The event, called the Lake Travis Trump boat parade, had been organized on Facebook with images of Trump campaign slogans adorning a variety of boats. Water-borne parades of Trump supporters have taken place across the US this summer from New Jersey to South Carolina with some of the parades reportedly involving several thousand boats. Trump himself has even spoken out in support of them. \u201cI just wish I had time, I\u2019d get on one of those boats, and I\u2019d be carrying a flag also,\u201d the US president said in a campaign video released in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
