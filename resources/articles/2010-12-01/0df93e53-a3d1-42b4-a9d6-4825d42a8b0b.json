Lehnhoff roots the tragedy in the dysfunctional relationship between Rigoletto (Zeljko Lucic) and Gilda (Diana Damrau), rather than in the jester's developing conflict with the Duke (Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez). Yet he also takes on board a comment in the text that this world is hell: the Duke's cronies don demonic disguises to carry out Gilda's abduction, while her final act of self-sacrifice, played out against a Michelangelesque backdrop of the day of judgment, acquires ambivalently redemptive, Christ-like overtones. Some of this strains against the score, since Damrau and Lucic have to pitch their characterisations as more neurotic \u2013 therefore less sympathetic \u2013 than the music suggests. But vocally they've rarely been bettered, while Fl\u00f3rez, cast against his squeaky-clean image, is insidiously sensual as the Duke. There's powerhouse conducting from Fabio Luisi, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
