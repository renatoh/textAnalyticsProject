The red mist had consumed the Thomond crowd, their team were nine points clear, thanks to the impeccable boot of Ronan O'Gara, the fly-half who can still do no wrong in these parts, and he had just put his foot to the ball again, sending it high into the night sky. It would take a while to come down and when it did, what would become of those beneath it? The Saracens defence had just watched the last garryowen \u2013 the kick named after the Limerick club of that name, the originators of the strategy of punt, pursue and pulverise \u2013 and had let it bounce. And here was O'Gara, tormenting them again. Saracens had arrived boasting the only lineout in Europe to concede nothing on their own throw. Wave perfection in the face of Munster and they were likely to prod it: \"It was a goal, to test their lineout,\" said their New Zealander coach, Rob Penney, \"to cause a quake in their thinking \u2026\" The 100% record was no more, with Munster regularly picking off Schalk Brits's throws. And the scrum was not going much better for the English club, even if the French referee, Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re, had found fault with the technique of the Munster tight-head prop BJ Botha. A free-kick and penalty had gone against the South African but Munster had then stolen two against the head. Saracens were not accustomed to being this exposed at the set piece. And given that they had also let the very first kick-off bounce without being caught, it was not surprising that their coach, Mark McCall, said: \"We were way below our best.\" And now, trailing 15-6, they were waiting for the ball to come down from the sky. The moment passed. Saracens caught and cleared. When Munster, through their brightest runner, Keith Earls, came back one more time with the ball in hand, Neil de Kock and Brad Barritt poured back to make their tackles. There was still spice in the contact area \u2013 an early brawl had seen Donncha O'Callaghan and Rhys Gill sent to the sin-bin \u2013 and Doug Howlett now lined up Alex Goode and cut him in two with a tackle that would have been exemplary if only the full-back had been in possession of the ball, but there was a new agenda now. Saracens still trailed but time was on their side to claim a losing bonus point. For the first time in the match they put together a chain of passes, sending the industrious Kelly Brown towards the corner. Simon Zebo made the tackle of the match to force the wing forward into touch, but from that same area of the field Owen Farrell was soon lining up a seventh penalty. He had been successful with only two and had not looked entirely comfortable against Earls. But now he had a moment of his own and he seized his chance. It meant that defeat now had a context, being merely part one of a double-header in a fiendishly tight Group One. \"We are confident we can play a lot better,\" McCall said. \"It is one of the strengths of this club that we work things out quickly and put them right.\" Penney, new to all this, was just as intrigued by the back-to-back nature of rounds three and four in the Heineken Cup: \"It's like planning a Test series. We'll be looking at the nuances of this, working on a couple of things we may have missed first time around.\" It is as if the ball is still up there, waiting to come down.
