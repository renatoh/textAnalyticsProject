Last weekend's runaway Irish Derby winner was a best-priced 7\u20134 with the layers but has not been entered by his trainer, Aidan O'Brien, who still has the market leader in Golden Sword who was beaten five lengths by his stable companion at The Curragh on Sunday. Sir Michael Stoute, who broke his Leger duck last year when sending out Conduit to success, has made just two entries, Harbinger and Saptapadi, in his bid to land back-to-back victories. \"I saw Harbinger on Tuesday morning and he looked fantastic,\" said Harry Herbert, managing director of the colt's owners, Highclere Thoroughbred Racing. \"He did some half-speed work today and he's really doing well physically. At the moment, the plan is to run him in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood at the end of the month and take it one step at a time. \"Harbinger's on an upward curve and he's a physical specimen that we can only see improving. He would have run in the King Edward VII Stakes but he had a muscle pull, which forced him to miss a couple of pieces of work. \"It was nothing seriously wrong and he's held in pretty high regard so we didn't want to risk him. He's not guaranteed to get the Leger trip and he's a horse with plenty of natural speed, as we saw at Chester. We will hopefully see how he gets on in the Gordon Stakes or possibly the Great Voltigeur and we will learn more about him there.\" St Leger sponsors Ladbrokes bet: 4\u20131 Golden Sword, 6\u20131 Father Time, Mourayan, 7\u20131 Masterofthehorse, 12\u20131 Age Of Aquarius, Harbinger, 14\u20131 Black Bear Island, Holberg, 16\u20131 Changingoftheguard, Flying Cloud, 20\u20131 Again, Alwaary, Dixie Music, Freemantle and Native Ruler."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
