Based on the legend of the monster of G\u00e9vaudan, a blood-boltered killer of the 1760s, it has scientist Samuel Le Bihan and Iroquois blood brother (and chief ass-kicker) Mark Dacascos sent by Louis XV to find out who's eating his people. It's a little ragged and overlong, but full of sharp-fanged action and visceral thrills. Minority Report (Steven Spielberg, 2002) 9.40pm, Sky Movies 1 Tom Cruise is top Precop John Anderton, head of a squad who can foresee and intervene in murders before they are committed in this scintillating piece of sci-fi. But for political reasons he is framed and forced to go on the run to prove his innocence, pursued by former colleagues and investigator Colin Farrell. Adapted from a story by the sci-fi genius Philip K Dick, Spielberg's movie is effectively a Hitchcock chase thriller set in a hugely inventive, perfectly realised futureworld, complete with personalised adverts in the shopping mall, scary spider-robots and backstreet eye-transplants. Brilliant. Lenny (Bob Fosse, 1974) 1.10am, Sky Cinema 1 Fosse, fresh from the success of Cabaret, went back to the nightclubs for this biopic of the iconoclastic stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce. Fosse aims at a documentary style - monochrome photography (beautifully done by Bruce Surtees), taking time out to interview Bruce himself, flashbacks - but it doesn't rise above standard Hollywood fare. Dustin Hoffman, however, is abrasively compelling in the title role, and does some very funny club routines. Felicia's Journey (Atom Egoyan, 1999) 1.45am, FilmFour Egoyan, director of The Adjuster, Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter, brings his exotic imagination to bear on the banality of evil in this utterly gripping thriller. Adapted from William Trevor's novel, it has Elaine Cassidy's sweet, pregnant Felicia travelling to Birmingham to find her soldier-lover. There she meets kindly but vaguely sinister catering manager, Hilditch (Bob Hoskins); and the elements are in place for a sordid crime. A small, low-key, atmospheric masterpiece. Paul Howlett Sport Live Tennis 10.30am, Sky Sports Xtra Sky must be quite excited give their entire day to the start of the final event of the full men's calendar in Paris. After this week, only the season-ending Masters Cup remains - with only the top eight players involved and Tim Henman scrabbling to secure his invite. With the last few places in Houston still up for grabs, Henman is battling Marat Safin and Andre Agassi, not to mention a recent history of fatigue, and has the added pressure of being defending champion here.
