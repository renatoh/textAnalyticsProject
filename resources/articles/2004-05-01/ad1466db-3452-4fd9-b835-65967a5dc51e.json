Think Laurel and Hardy, Steptoe and Son, Terry and Bob in The Likely Lads - and to them add Ian and Steve at Weymouth FC. My Observer colleague Ian Ridley, chairman of the Doc Martens League side, and his manager Steve Claridge were the undoubted stars of last night's very funny Football Diaries on BBC2; the first of six programmes of interlocking stories from different football clubs billed as \"pure sporting soap\". Ridley took over his hometown club a year ago and installed Claridge as player-manager, presumably because he decided he had reached that stage in his life where he needed more grey hair. Ian is no Abramovich - unless writing sport for the quality press can be a whole lot more lucrative than those bean counters at the Guardian are letting on to me - and Claridge, with his extensive league experience, is a luxury item for Weymouth. It is not the money, though, that gives the chairman his careworn expression and has him reaching for the fags. His manager has the laddish jocosity born of a lifetime of locker rooms, while Ridley himself is made of sterner stuff, a little anally retentive maybe (he should pardon me for saying so) in the way that some of the best football writers often are. So we keep seeing Ian, suited and booted for some important event - a photocall or a golf day - looking anxiously at his watch and scanning the horizon for signs of the conspicuously absent Steve, who invariably turns up half an hour late or more, wearing what is described in the programme as \"a boyish grin\" - and we all know how irritating those can be in a man of nearly 40. \"Steve's tardiness can be a problem,\" says Ridley through gritted teeth. \"I'm not happy.\" He didn't look it. Claridge, on the other hand, looked as cheerful as you like, steadfastly refusing to take his boss seriously. His explanation of Ridley's management style, gleefully given to the show's producers in the presence of Ridley, was as follows: \"He nicks other people's sayings and passes them off as his own. You know how he greeted our one black player? 'How you doin', man?' How you doin', man? I ask you . . .\" Collapse of impish party. While Claridge chuckles, we see Ridley wearing what I can only describe as an expression of resigned indulgence. At this point he is absolutely Bob to Claridge's Terry. Encouragingly, as close followers of these pages will know, it does not end in tears. While Weymouth have missed out on promotion, the crowds are up, and Ridley and Claridge are attracting new money to the club. There are dancing girls at the first match, and the ball is sponsored by \"one of Weymouth's premier nite spots\" - and unless the town has altered radically since my days as a reporter there, that will have been a very short list for the boys to canvass. The programme has some fun contrasting Ian and Steve's desperate scrabbling for money with lavishly funded Reading and Chelsea, the two other teams featured in the first programme. While Weymouth have to budget for unblocking a couple of defective turnstiles - possibly because they have seized up - John Madejski at Reading has a luxury penthouse flat built at the stadium that bears his name. When Ridley complains \"Steve Claridge doesn't come cheap\" he is talking about a demand for \u00a33,500 worth of non-slip lino in the changing rooms. At Reading, meanwhile, a \u00a3380,000 pitch is laid, reinforced with poly-something-or-other so that it doesn't divot. Playing the comedy card was a smart move for the programme, as the cliff-hanging plotlines favoured by more conventional soaps clearly would not work now we know how the football season turns out. The off-screen interviewer, who seems to have picked up a trick or two from masters of the genre like Jon Ronson and Louis Theroux, has a nice line in deliberately sardonic misunderstandings. \"This reminds me of that film with Jack Nicholson,\" says Madejski, as he guides him through a long corridor beneath the stand at his stadium. \"What was it called?\" \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest?\" is offered. \"No,\" says Madejski, oblivious to the irony, \"the one with the little boy riding his bike.\" When Madejski arrives back at his huge country pile, he \"looks as pleased as any man who finds a parking space outside his front door\", according to the commentary, a reference to the chairman's vast collection of expensive motor cars. High-performance vehicles also featured heavily in the segments of the programme dedicated to players, whose contributions were predictably nowhere near as entertaining as those of the chairmen. As usual, with them it was mostly about cars or houses. We saw John Terry receiving a massage in his extravagant pad while the phone rang repeatedly, a silly tinny ring, and the footballer pointedly did not answer. \"It's like being trapped in a Toytown telephone exchange,\" went the commentary. Surprisingly, this was not simile of the week. That came from Malcolm Boyden on Radio Five Live, describing Grimsby manager Nicky Law. \"He's sweating like a glass blower's backside,\" said Boyden - which, come to think of it, is not a bad description of Ridley, when he got the bill for the lino. martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
