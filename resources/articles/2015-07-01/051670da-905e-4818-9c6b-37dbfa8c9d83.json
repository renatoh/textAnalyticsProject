But the joint communiqu\u00e9, issued by 24 academic and professional institutions, also says that tackling global warming would drive economic progress, benefit the health of millions by cutting air pollution and improve access to energy, water and food. To have a reasonable chance of keeping warming below 2C, the internationally agreed danger limit, the world must end all emissions within the next few decades, the communiqu\u00e9 warns. The British Academy is one of the 24 institutions and its president, the climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, said David Cameron and the UK had a special responsibility to lead the fight against climate change. \u201cThe UK led the world with both the modern scientific revolution and the industrial revolution, and must lead again now on the creation of a safer, cleaner and more prosperous world,\u201d Stern said. \u201cNow is the time for the prime minister and the rest of his government to show leadership on this issue, by implementing effective domestic policies to tackle climate change and to support efforts overseas, including a strong international agreement [at a crunch UN summit] in Paris at the end of this year,\u201d said Stern. Cameron signed a pledge ahead of May\u2019s general election which promised \u201cto accelerate the transition to a competitive, energy-efficient low-carbon economy\u201d. But since winning a majority, Cameron\u2019s government has been heavily criticised for cutting support for renewable energy, including onshore wind farms, and for energy efficiency schemes. \u201cThe transition to a low-carbon economy offers enormous opportunities for better and stronger [economic] growth,\u201d said Stern. Sir John Beddington, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser until 2013 and now president of the Zoological Society of London, said some impacts of climate change are already here and will continue for decades, even if emissions are slashed. He said taking steps to adapt to these unavoidable changes was vital: \u201cThis is particularly important for human welfare, where water and food security issues loom.\u201d \u201cActions need to be taken now, by governments, individuals, businesses, local communities and public institutions, if we are to tackle this global challenge [and] deliver the required cuts in emissions,\u201d states the communiqu\u00e9. The institutions backing the message include the Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institution of Civil Engineers. Another institution involved is health research charity the Wellcome Trust, which has been the focus of a Guardian\u2019s Keep it in the Ground campaign. The campaign has asked the charity to sell its substantial investments in fossil fuel companies. The Wellcome Trust acknowledges climate change is a great threat to health and the campaign argues that it is therefore \u201cmorally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning more oil, gas and coal.\u201d The communiqu\u00e9, issued on Tuesday, spells out the opportunities of action to curb climate change, as well as the risks. \u201cWhile the threats posed by climate change are far-reaching, the ways in which we tackle them can be a source of great opportunity,\u201d it states. \u201cCapturing this potential quickly and effectively will drive economic progress. There are also significant additional benefits available, including food, energy and water security, air quality [and] health improvements.\u201d The text of the full communiqu\u00e9 The scientific evidence is now overwhelming that the climate is warming and that human activity is largely responsible for this change through emissions of greenhouse gases. Governments will meet in Paris in November and December this year to negotiate a legally binding and universal agreement on tackling climate change. Any international policy response to climate change must be rooted in the latest scientific evidence. This indicates that if we are to have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming in this century to 2\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial period, we must transition to a zero-carbon world by early in the second half of the century. To achieve this transition, governments should demonstrate leadership by recognising the risks climate change poses, embracing appropriate policy and technological responses, and seizing the opportunities of low-carbon and climate-resilient growth. Risks. Climate change poses risks to people and ecosystems by exacerbating existing economic, environmental, geopolitical, health and societal threats, and generating new ones. These risks increase disproportionately as the temperature increases. Many systems are already at risk from climate change. A rise of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels would lead to further increased risk from extreme weather and would place more ecosystems and cultures in significant danger. At or above 4\u00b0C, the risks include substantial species extinction, global and regional food insecurity, and fundamental changes to human activities that today are taken for granted. Responses. Responding to the challenge will require deploying the full breadth of human talent and invention. Creative policy interventions and novel technological solutions need to be fostered and applied. This will require a sustained commitment to research, development, entrepreneurship, education, public engagement, training and skills. Opportunities. While the threats posed by climate change are far-reaching, the ways in which we tackle them can be a source of great opportunity. There exists vast potential for innovation, for example in low-carbon technologies. Capturing this potential quickly and effectively will drive economic progress. There are also significant additional benefits available from climate mitigation and adaptation actions, including food, energy and water security, air quality, health improvements, and safeguarding the services that ecosystems provide. Actions need to be taken now, by governments, individuals, businesses, local communities and public institutions, if we are to tackle this global challenge, deliver the required cuts in emissions, and take maximum advantage of the available opportunities and additional benefits.
