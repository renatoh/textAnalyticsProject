The sense that \u201cLet\u2019s Rock\u201d is a conscious return to basics is only amplified by that title, even if the quote marks give them the option of distancing themselves from the sentiment. Ironic or not, there\u2019s certainly plenty here that\u2019s easy on the ear, from the breathlessly propulsive rhythm of Eagle Birds and the slick 70s-influenced AOR of Tell Me Lies to the Stonesy swagger of recent single Lo/Hi (even if the latter\u2019s lyrics appear to have been composed using a Bobby Gillespie-edition fridge-magnet poetry set: \u201cOut on a limb in the wind of a hurricane\u201d, indeed). However, while this set offers further evidence to suggest that Dan Auerbach was rather exaggerating the extent of his writer\u2019s block on his 2017 solo album, Waiting on a Song, equally there is nothing that comes close to matching the unbridled euphoria of the breakthrough songs that made them unlikely indie disco floor-fillers at the start of the decade. It all adds up to an album that\u2019s solid rather than spectacular."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
