That\u2019s a legacy of 1978, when the men\u2019s team went over there and rewrote the dictionary definitions of both hubris and fiasco. They had been seen off in style by 30,000 delirious fans at Hampden, but as they approached their hilltop hotel, the clutch on their bus burnt out, and a truck had to nudge them the last 200 metres of their journey. It proved a powerful metaphor. Peru and Iran did a number on them; beleaguered manager Ally McLeod bent down to stroke a dog, uttering the immortal words \u201cAt least this wee fellow loves me!\u201d just before the mutt sank its teeth into his hand; and Archie Gemmill scored the best goal in the history of All Football only for it to mean nothing 202 seconds later when Holland\u2019s Johnny Rep lashed one in from downtown Buenos Aires. Oh Scotland! Ah Argentina! Oh aaaiiee aaarrgh. Unbelievably, Scotland\u2019s women have somehow conspired to do what was previously thought impossible, and take things up a couple of notches from there. When Erin Cuthbert scored Scotland\u2019s third goal against Argentina with 21 minutes to go, and with a quarter-final spot theirs for the taking, someone on the BBC used the phrase \u201ccomfortable lead\u201d, and it was at this point the Fiver knew the jig was up. Scotland simply don\u2019t do comfort, and the goddess of fate had been goaded into wreaking revenge with extreme prejudice. Within 10 minutes, Argentina had scored twice, after which the concession of a last-minute equaliser was a thundering inevitability. Sure enough, Florencia Bonsegundo\u2019s injury-time penalty sent Scotland packing, putting the tin lid on a collapse up there with anything the notoriously accident-prone men have suffered. Hey, it\u2019s an achievement of sorts. And yet Shelley Kerr\u2019s team shouldn\u2019t feel too bad about themselves. For a start, with the ball back in their court, the Fiver is fairly sure the lads will soon brew up another scenario so preposterous it\u2019ll put this unfortunate business in the shade. Secondly, Scotland were ultimately undone by VAR, which is ruining football, and it\u2019s only going to get worse. And thirdly, Scotland are generally on an upward curve, having reached the finals of a major tournament for the very first time. While it stings now, that\u2019s something to be proud of, and the experience will stand them in good stead for the next Euros, when they\u2019ll become the first Scottish team to get out of a group stage at a major tournament, you mark our words. The only thing that makes us slightly uneasy about all this is the fact that the Scottish FA must be doing something right. That\u2019s not how it usually goes, is it?

RECOMMENDED LISTENING It\u2019s Football. Weekly. Extraaaaaaa! FIVER LETTERS \u201cWatching the Women\u2019s World Cup it\u2019s great to see that many of the less appealing traditions of the men\u2019s game have been jettisoned. There\u2019s far less hatred from the stands, histrionics on the pitch and, for those of us with weaker stomachs, a pleasing disinclination towards spitting at every break in play. In all this cultural cleansing, can anyone explain how the vainglorious England Band survived the cull?\u201d \u2013 Adam Uncamus. \u201cI read about Bury\u2019s current misery and was reminded of a dinner I attended at Gigg Lane back in 2001. It was the British premiere of the film Swordfish, a swashbuckling gangster shoot \u2019em up, starring John Travolta. It was quite the coup. Warner Brothers snubbed Leicester Square in favour of Bury, where their brand new multiplex proudly straddled Pilsworth Industrial Estate (just off the M66). Afterwards there were drinks and a meal at Gigg Lane. I was lucky enough to attend. Mr Travolta was also there, clearly under duress and looked more than a little surprised to be seated on an orange, plastic, bucket seat. I can report he opted for the fish, not the chicken and didn\u2019t eat much of that. Frankly, it all rather blew my young mind, the north would never be the same again. Spin on three decades, the Warner Brothers cinema no longer exists and I haven\u2019t see John Travolta since. Life imitates art?\u201d \u2013 Marten Allen. \u201cFans of nominative determinism will have been thrilled to read this sentence about a player missing a penalty but getting a chance to retake it in the Guardian\u2019s match report on the extraordinarily farcical Scotland v Argentina match: \u2018Bonsegundo then made sure with her second effort that sealed the draw and Scotland\u2019s dismal fate\u201d \u2013 Robert Heath.
