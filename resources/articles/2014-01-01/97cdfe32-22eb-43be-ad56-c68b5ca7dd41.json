Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes three and four of the second season \u2013 and if you've seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. Read Stuart Jeffries' episodes one and two blog. Catch up with Vicky Frost's series one blog Hello. So many questions this week as the series hits its stride in the third and fourth episodes. How did they do that aerial shot of the explosion of the tanker that torched the security guard? Is the person who goes by the chatroom handle \"Mother of Three\" the evil genius behind the eco-terrorist outrages? Is \"Mother of Three\" a dude? Or, in a double-bluff, a mother of three? And, in any case, are they the same person as the one whose hands we see in the last shot of episode four, opening a parcel containing the animal heads used by the now-slain quartet of eco-terrorists in their self-justifying videos? Why did Julian Christensen have not one but two table lamps on his desk? What about his wrong moustache and weird rug \u2013 could he look any more suspicious? Why hasn't Rasmus been busted down to traffic duty given his hopelessness at detective work? And, my personal favourite, is it OK for a husband to buy his wife breast implants as a birthday present? I'm going to go out on a limb on that last question and say no, it's not OK, though if you can think of mitigating circumstances for Caroline's husband offering her a boob job gratis during what looked like foreplay, then don't be shy of setting out your reasons below. Who, by the way, is Caroline Brandstrup-Julin and what is she doing in this story? Personally, I like not knowing yet and being tantalized by the scriptwriters with a sub-plot that so far hasn't been integrated into the rest of the drama. But let me ask you this. If you were a male prostitute (perhaps you are and, if so, I look forward to reading your comments below), would you take 1,500 kroner from a client (ie Caroline) when she gets queasy about going through with the whole sex thing, and then leave without saying thank you? Because that strikes me as rude. You'd have thought it's part of the sex workers' code, at least in Sweden and Denmark, that a \"thank you, ma'am\" is implicit on payment. Thoughts? Let's get back to the investigation. What do we know? The four original eco-terrorists did not kill themselves in the container where their bodies were found. Saga (Malm\u00f6 detective Saga Nor\u00e9n, our show's heroine) proved as much when she and the pathologist examined the bodies. Incidentally, what a bravura (or maybe daft) plot twist to bump off four characters just as they were getting established. Didn't see that coming. Did you? But if they were murdered, two questions: by whom and why? The most likely theory is that they were done in by eco-terrorists' \"higher-ups\" (as Matilde said before she was bumped off), probably vexed at the rogue splashiness of Mads' detonation of the petrol tanker and also worried that the cops were getting so close to arresting them (the eco-terrorists) that they had to be erased to protect the rest of the conspirators. And where did whoever killed them get the drug that poisoned the foursome? This is an important question because one of the slain, Niklas, was a lab assistant at the pharmaceutical company that held stocks of pneumonic plague. Saga and Martin's investigation seemed to be pointing to the possibility that Niklas stole the drug that he used to poison the corporate fruit baskets and prawn-based ready-meals with murderous consequences. So, if he's dead, where did the murderer get the gear that did him and the other three in? Was it leftovers from the stash we presume Niklas filched from work? Or was the presumption that Niklas stole the gear, as they say in France, un hareng rouge? Hold on, though. Here's another thought. Yes, Saga demonstrated that at least one of the murdered four was in all the videos, but it's possible that the murdered four weren't always the same quartet who appeared in the videos. Maybe, then, there are survivors from the original cast of the video. My money's on Caroline's husband because he's got previous in ill-judged activity (cf boob-job gifts). Or maybe not. Maybe Caroline, disappointed in love, unfulfilled in work, is pulling the strings of this vast conspiracy. Another possibility is that Jens, jailed murderer of Martin's son August, is directing eco-terrorist operations from his cell \u2013 which would explain his insufferably smug smile during his interviews with Martin. I concede, though, that that's a stretch. Julian, the aforementioned bad-moustachioed, two-table-lamp-using IT entrepreneur is likely to have been a junior member of the gang. After all, he knew what sister Matilde was up to, put the frighteners on Niklas when Niklas wanted out and, using the chatroom handle \"Stressed Dad\", was communicating terroristy stuff to \"Mother of Three\", and seemed in thrall to the latter. But now he's dead. Which just goes to show what happens if you have dodgy moustaches and two table lamps in Scandinavia these days. He died in the car park of Malm\u00f6 stadium, after arranging to meet \"Mother of Three\". But who actually turned up to kill him? The \"Mother of Three\" or his/her henchperson? We will have to wait until the next episode to find out. Certainly, Martin and Saga found the memory card for the camera Laura used to film the meeting between Julian and \"Mother of Three\" at Malm\u00f6 stadium car park, but they haven't yet uploaded the images for investigation. Laura's role, of course, is intriguing. She's already ruined her maths teacher's career by blabbing about their affair at school, and how she's (you'd think) in the remaining eco-terrorists' crosshairs for filming the slaying of Julian because she saw how the killing went down and so can probably ID the culprit. The remaining eco-terrorists probably don't know that the memory card is in police possession, but that doesn't matter: they need to do her in sharpish because under Saga's cross-examination (once they get her in the interview room, which can't be hard), she'll sing like a Swedish canary. (Are Swedish canaries proverbially bad at keeping shtum, you ask? Do I look like, an ornithologist?) Here, incidentally, is another moral question. If a guy with a dodgy moustache offered you, Laura, a testy lesbian with a jerk of a dad, 5,000 kroner to help him elude cops who are investigating a murder conspiracy, thereby exposing you to the risk of prosecution at very least for perverting the course of justice, would you go for it? If you answered yes, then frankly I don't even know who you are any more. If you aren't sure because you don't know how much kroners are worth, then let me say this: that's a cop out. No matter: in my view, Laura is a dead girl walking. Saga and Martin All the above plot twists are wonderful fun but, for me, the main reason for watching The Bridge is for the drama of a detective who has Asperger's living and working in a world where people overwhelmingly don't have Asperger's. This is what makes the odd-couple relationship between Saga and Martin more freighted than that between Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Butch and Sundance or Morse and Lewis. As I mentioned last week, Saga's my role model, leather trousers and hair issues notwithstanding.Not chiefly because I covet her Porsche (though I do, but because of a bracing directness I haven't yet been able bring to social interactions. \"Are you and Pernille [another detective on the case] having sex?\" Saga asked Martin. No, he replied. Undaunted, she went on. \"Are you and Mette having sex even though you're separated?\" No, he replied. \"So who are you having sex with? You used to have sex all the time.\" Inexorable logic. Of course, this is no way to interact with a co-worker but, you've got to admit, she asks the questions that would trouble anyone who worked with the formerly libidinous beardy Dane. I loved his lesson for her in empathetic social niceties. Martin tells her that his son is sick. She wanders off. He calls her back and repeats: \"My son fell ill last night.\" Finally, the penny drops for Saga. \"I hope he gets better,\" she says. She's trying to fit in, to become that boring thing ordinary people covet, ie normal. Fine, but part of me prefers her as she is. I particularly loved her evisceration of Martin and Mette's nanny. \"Aren't kids adorable? I love kids,\" says Anna-Dea. \"Why?\" asks Saga, really wanting to know. \"Because they're kids.\" That's no argument and Saga's raised eyebrows clinched the point Moments of genius 1: Saga and Linus You'd have thought that Saga would be the worst person to conduct an interview with Linus, the boy who has lost his parents and now lost the only person who looks after him, his murdered eco-terrorist brother Niklas. She lacks, you'd have thought, the necessary empathy. But here's the twist. It was oafish Rasmus who let Linus see the TV reports that made it clear his brother was dead. What a jerk. More importantly, it was Saga who \u2013 without wishing to console him \u2013 proved to Linus he wasn't instrumental in his brother's death. No wonder he hugged her. No wonder, too, that she looked mystified when he did. Moments of genius 2: The dead woman's ringing phone There's a mobile phone ringing inside a body bag. I love it when things like that happen in crime dramas. The dead can't talk, but their phones still keep moving the story along. At the crime scene, Detective Martin Rohde wanders over, unzips the bag and fumbles for the phone. Julian, watching TV coverage from the crime scene, sees Martin answer the phone and so knows his sister is dead. And the resulting conversation means Martin now has a lead in the murder case, pushing the story along. Terrific stuff. Thoughts and observations \u2022\"The fight don't end,\" read the note found with the corpses in the container. Who expresses themselves with such bad English grammar? Not, in my experience, Swedes or Danes. \u2022 What was the word that Linus tagged on Julian's car? Is it rude? Was it in Danish or Swedish? \u2022 Did anyone notice that Saga undid her leather trousers after her colleagues knocked off for the night? So, you know, she could really relax and think about the case hard. Two things: if she really doesn't care what people think about her personal habits (as she showed last week with the whole changing-her-smelly shirt-in-busy-office-office deal), why did she wait until they'd gone? And, two, did she do them up again? And if not, how did those iconic leather strides stay up in the final scenes of episode four? My teachers must be so proud to see this is the sort of question preoccupying me in later life. \u2022 Saga's heroically ineffectual boss looks like a decrepit Stephen King. Plus, I know it's cold in Sweden, but big print zip-up sweaters? You don't need to Ask Hadley to know that's wrong \u2022 Apart from finding the memory card and answering the dead woman's mobile, what did Martin bring to the investigation? Plus, Rasmus is all liability, covering up his ineptitude rather than busting the case wide open. Strikes me that Saga's doing all the work. Probably rubbish predictions for next week's episodes \u2022 Laura gets rubbed out for knowing too much. \u2022 Marcus Stenberg, the suspicious bee-keeping ship-owner from episode one, makes a comeback, possibly as the man with the hands at the end of episode four. I still suspect his bees are killer bees, poised for deployment. \u2022 We find out how the parcel came into those hands \u2013 the best bet is that they were posted by one of the slain eco-terrorists before they died. \u2022 Saga IDs Julian's murderer from the memory chip. She's that good. \u2022 Rasmus gets found out for his cover-up by Saga. And, understandably, fired. \u2022 Martin gets it on with Pernille and, oh dear, Mette finds out. \u2022 The eco-terrorist gang commit a new murderous outrage \u2013 and make a new video deploying those animals heads once more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
