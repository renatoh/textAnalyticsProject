She resembled a Soviet dissident finally worn down by the KGB and the promise that she would keep her job as night cleaner at a power station in Irkutsk. She looked defeated. Her eyes were glassy, and she glanced at the camera only once or twice. Instead she stared at the floor. Perhaps, like Osama bin Laden (or so we are told), she was passing on secret messages decipherable only by her supporters. The message seemed to be: \"I don't really mean any of this stuff. And I'd do it again.\" Her words, as broadcast by cable news from a cave somewhere in the Department of Transport, sounded contrite. \"I fully understand people's disgust at what I wrote. It is something that I wish I had never done, and indeed find it difficult to believe that I did. It is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life.\" Normally I would feel sorry for such a person. But spin doctors are different from us. Taking advantage of anything at all is not only what they are trained to do; it's in every fibre of their being. I imagined our cat reacting in the same way to family outrage over the bleeding blackbird corpse it brought in. \"I am truly shocked by my own behaviour in this matter. It is something I shall have to live with for the rest of my life, and I only hope that other members of the Hoggart family can find it in their hearts to forgive.\" Pointless, of course; such behaviour is hard-wired into cats, and taking advantage of other's misfortune is in the RAM built into spin doctors. Then I popped into the Commons chamber to see Alan Milburn, the health secretary, make a statement about anthrax. Apparently, as far as this lethal disease is concerned, we have nothing to fear except fear itself. \"The best intelligence we have,\" Mr Milburn said, \"is that it would be extremely difficult indeed for anyone to deliver a sufficient quantity of anthrax to cause harm to a large number of people. \"However, as we can see from America, the result of anthrax attacks has been to spread fear amongst a large number of people. It is important that fear does not win.\" Liam Fox, for the Tories, said much the same. \"Anthrax is a low risk threat, but it is a good agent of panic.\" I think I would trust these guys a little more if I thought there was the faintest chance of them ever saying, \"Right, it's now time to panic!\" Jack Straw opened the latest debate on the crisis. He had little new to say, though Labour unease is clearly beginning to spread. Gwynneth Dunwoody, no raving leftie, warned that the public would continue to agree to the war only as long as it was short, defensible, and had a clear ending in view. Would Mr Straw promise to explain to the house, very straightforwardly, \"just what it is that the British people will have to accept?\" If I were Mr Straw, I could live with the fumings of the professional peacemongers, but I would be quite worried by Mrs Dunwoody."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
