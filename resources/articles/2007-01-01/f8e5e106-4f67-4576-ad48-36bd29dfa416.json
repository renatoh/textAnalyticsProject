To anyone else, or at least anyone under 30, he's just Nicole Richie's father, a perception that's unlikely to be shifted by Just Go. It's been produced to the lushest AOR standards by an array of expensive talent, including Stargate and Akon, and finds Richie in reliably smooth voice, ruminating placidly about love. Fair enough; that's what he's for, and he's game enough to couch it in crisp electronica on Somewhere in London, and Afrobeat on Nothing Left to Give. Given the stress of dealing with a troublesome daughter, he must exert iron control over his emotions, though - he's rarely sounded so unruffled. What would it be like if he let go a bit?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
