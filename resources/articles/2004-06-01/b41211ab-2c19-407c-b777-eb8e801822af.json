Mainly because it isn't really a sport, a sport by my reckoning being any activity that requires a shower afterwards. I've always regarded golf as yoga for businessmen, chess for people with average IQs or simply posh snooker. Another give-away sign that golf isn't a sport is the idea that you can go on a golfing 'holiday'. Any activity that can come branded as a holiday is simply that: an activity, and not a sport, see yoga and walking. Real sports don't come in the holiday variety. People don't do mountaineering holidays, they go mountaineering. It's an important distinction. Anyhow, I'm on a golfing holiday in Bermuda. I'm here because, frankly, a colleague who actually likes playing golf and has a not unimpressive handicap (ie they're quite good) dropped out at the last minute. Since the last time I picked up a golf club was around 25 years ago at a Bournemouth crazy golf course, I'm getting some tuition. We're at an immaculate green course called Tucker's Point - which for me at least couldn't be a better place to start. Chaka is the assistant golf professional at Tucker's Point and my tutor. We've taken the short golf buggy ride from the clubhouse to the driving range. It's a sunny day and apart from a man in loud checked trousers efficiently smacking balls into the distance we have the place to ourselves. 'So have you ever hit a golf ball before?' Chaka gets my measure. 'No.' 'Do you play any sports?' 'Not really,' I say. Chaka looks at me like he's never met one of me before, one of those no-sport people. Chaka shows me how to grip the club. There are many grips he says, the 10-finger, the interlocking, the overlapping. 'Use whatever feels comfortable,' he advises. 'Everyone wants to know what Tiger uses,' he adds. 'So what does Tiger use?' I ask (naturally). 'The interlocking, but you should use whatever feels comfortable.' I try the interlocking. It feels very comfortable. Next I need to get myself a swing. The feet need to be apart but not too far, the knees slightly bent, the back straight, bent from the hips, the ball should be somewhere between your belt buckle and the crest on your polo shirt, but that depends on what club you're using. There's a lot of stuff to remember. But compared with other things I'd never tried before, my first time at golf feels like it's going well. I raise the club and thwack. I hit the ball about 75 yards, it veers off into some trees, but I'm feeling pretty pleased with myself. Chaka looks mildly surprised. It proves to be a fluke. The next few shots I 'air' the ball (ie totally miss it), I swing the club into the ground, I hit a couple that run along the ground for 10 feet, and then I manage to nutmeg myself with a golf ball which narrowly misses the only other player on the range. 'Sorry,' I say. An hour later, the lesson's over, but the sun is still shining, I'm practising my putting, 'holing' the odd one from eight feet, I've got a nippy golf buggy with a pleasingly technical-looking borrowed bag of clubs made by a company called Ping (what a brilliant name for a golf club manufacturer) and I'm thinking 'hey I like this, and I might even be good at it. Cool'. I think about asking Chaka to invite me to be a member of Tucker's Point (it's by invitation only) but then I remember the $85,000 membership deposit, and sadly no same- surname discounts. The next day, I'm at a course attached to the Fairmount Southampton hotel, a big, chalky pink building with matching chalky pink golf buggies. The Southampton has over the years been owned by colourful characters from Billy Butlin to Tiny Rowland, and it's a sort of a ring-a-ding-ding kinda place. I keep expecting to see Dean Martin goosing one of the waitresses. Dean played a bit of golf in his time and he'd like this course, because a half-accomplished golfer could probably play it sloshed. The course is a par three, which means all the holes should take three shots. Most of the holes are a touch over 100 yards. Once out on the course there's a bunch of other stuff to be learnt - the correct way to place one of those markers for your ball on the green; replace your divots (adding sand where neces sary); when you land in a bunker walk the shortest distance from the edge to your ball and then afterwards rake over all your footprints with one of the rakes provided; and turn your mobile off. I decided my personal target should be to make one hole in three shots. I fail, but I make two holes in four, and I'm particularly pleased with one lengthy tee shot - even though it ends up in a lake. To understand and appreciate the apr\u00e8s-golf scene in Bermuda one has to realise that Bermuda is an island that took one look at 1963 and the Beatles, said 'no thanks, we'll stick with what we've got', and has stayed roughly the same ever since. And that's why people like it. Although I did enjoy some very modern sushi one night, the majority of restaurants serve a wonderfully retro menu. Hugely popular is 'surf and turf' (a big plate featuring half a lobster, a chunk of fillet steak and nothing else) and chocolate souffle is still a dessert. Anyhow I'm here to learn, not to menu bitch. Next day my tutor is called Scott Roy. He's the professional at Riddell's Bay golf course, a Bermudian native who resembles a sun-scorched version of Hollywood actor Michael Rappaport. Scott has got some unconventional teaching techniques. First he has me hitting a black bin liner filled with old tea towels to improve my swing. 'Does the same thing as a training aid costing $200,' he says. He recommends I make my own and keep thwacking it in my backyard. He then unveils 'the punisher', a sadomasochistic golf-teaching device. The punisher is essentially a golf club with an extended shaft - if your swing is off it kicks you in the side like a scally after a few pints. He also videos me hitting or trying to hit a golf ball and then shows me what's right and wrong with my swing. It appears I let my club drop when it's behind my head and also don't keep my back still - which begins to explain why the ball bananas off to the right 90 per cent of the time. These faults on their way to being corrected, I join my pals on the course. Now this is a proper golf course - some of the holes are supposed to take five shots, five! That's a lot more opportunity to mess up. And the holes are 300-400 yards, and I can only hit it 100 or so top - very occasionally. Playing on a proper, grown-up course is a lot harder. I lose around a dozen golf balls - some in undergrowth, some straight in the sea or in one of the other water features. I give up on most holes after a disappeared ball or a ham-fisted shot, but luckily I hit my best shot of the round, a near perfect 40-yard chip onto the green, while the course marshall is watching - it's the course marshall's job to give rubbish players like me their marching orders for holding everyone else up. Next day it rains, so the island's most prestigious course, Mid Ocean, is spared me spewing up divots all morning. Although it only has 62,000 residents, Bermuda has nine golf courses. So, despite being here for five days, I leave Bermuda without tackling four courses. The final, Port Royal is a Government-owned course, where I have my last lesson of the week. It's with the professional Francis Rabain, a one-time winner of the Bermuda Open. I show Francis what I have learnt so far. Francis has a more gnomic approach, 'You should hold the golf club like you're shaking a lady's hand' and 'Golf ain't a game for Samson'. Francis's technique is hands-on and intimate. If he sees a foot out of alignment he kicks it, a knee not bending he gently taps it, a swing not right, he spoons you guiding your hands like an experienced lover. Lesson over, back on the course it's the same old story: first few shots I hit sweetly then divots start flying, balls start disappearing and I begin to forget all that Chaka, Scott and Francis have taught me. Yes, it's a lot more difficult than it looks, and I have to concede it might indeed be a sport (a token one of the non-showering kind) after all.
