As the Conservative leadership race reaches an acrimonious finale, the sugar hit for the economy from the stockpiling rush before the original Brexit deadline has run its course, with warning signs emerging that growth will flatline. The prospect of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt allowing the country to walk away without a withdrawal agreement in place on 31 October has alarmed business groups and has put renewed pressure on the pound. Johnson has made clear that he will use the nuclear option if necessary, in a move observers warn could crash the economy into recession. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, said companies would want a safe pair of hands running Britain, rather than the \u201cerratic\u201d Johnson. \u201cThe political world is in turmoil and the idea that Boris Johnson will become our prime minister fills me \u2013 and many other businesspeople \u2013 with horror,\u201d he said. David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC, also writing in the Guardian, said either Johnson or Hunt taking Britain out of the EU without a deal would damage living standards. \u201cDiscussions of who will be prime minister are increasingly looking like a clown show, and as far as discussions of economics go, they are basically in fantasyland,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was worse than expected. In three cases, better. One met its forecast. Since the Brexit vote three years ago this month, the cost to the economy from lower economic growth than would have otherwise been the case under a remain vote has reached \u00a340bn, or about \u00a3800m a week of lost income \u2013 more than double the \u00a3350m figure printed on the side of the Vote Leave battlebus used by Johnson. The economy has not, however, collapsed into recession, as predicted by the gloomiest forecasts made ahead of the EU referendum, while unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since the mid-1970s and average workers\u2019 wages have accelerated at the fastest annual rate since the financial crisis. But storm clouds are beginning to emerge after jobs growth slowed markedly over the three months to April. Average wages after inflation remain below the level recorded before the 2008 crash, while consumer spending dropped in May, driven by cold weather and Brexit concerns. Fuelled by rising numbers of self-employed people and women entering the workforce, employment in Britain increased by 32,000 to reach a record high of 32.75m, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was the weakest since August 2018 and significantly down on the 99,000 added to the workforce in March, suggesting that Brexit-related uncertainty is beginning to make companies more cautious about hiring. Economic growth in Britain had raced ahead earlier this year, driven by a stockpiling rush as companies scrambled to prepare for no-deal Brexit ahead of a 29 March deadline, before Theresa May extended the process until the autumn. GDP growth reached 0.5% in the first quarter. However, the Bank of England warned this month the economy would flatline in the second quarter, slashing its forecast to zero from a previous estimate of 0.2%. Threadneedle Street warned that some companies would run down their emergency stockpiles over the next few months rather than place new orders, serving as a brake on growth. The Bank\u2019s network of regional agents said firms are as ready as they can be for Brexit, but that a lack of clarity from Westminster stops them from feeling fully prepared. In an early sign of the slowdown, GDP plunged by 0.4% in April from a month earlier as factories launched a wave of planned shutdowns around the time of the 29 March Brexit deadline. Blanchflower said: \u201cWe should expect an impact over the coming months even if no deal is avoided. The Bank expects zero growth in the second quarter, but it might well even be negative.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
