The 25-year-old Londoner has a big-punching reputation, with all his professional victories coming inside the distance, but question marks against his stamina and punch resistance were raised by his solitary defeat, against the veteran Carl Thompson 15 months ago. On that form Haye will be hard pressed against the 6ft 5in Gurov, who is also a heavy-handed fighter and at the age 34 has experience of boxing at a higher level. But Haye says: \"I feel I am ready to work my way up the world rankings and beat some quality fighters.\" He also claims to have learned from the setback against Thompson, saying: \"I've improved in every aspect since then. I go into the fights with a completely different mindset. I take it a lot more seriously now, because I know what the consequences are if you don't. I now know what it's like to lose and I don't want to ever be in that situation again. \"In my early fights, I found it difficult to get motivated because everything came so easily. But I've realised that if I put a foot wrong, things can come quickly crashing down. I've had one pro defeat and know another would be devastating for my career. I've seen Gurov around for years and sparred with him in the past. I know he's dangerous and I know if I make any mistakes he'll knock me out cold.\" Amir Khan will travel to Pakistan tomorrow to visit Oxfam's Earthquake Response Programme. He is going to Muzaffarbad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir that was devastated by the October 8 quake, and will see camps where Oxfam is providing shelter, water and sanitation for thousands who have been made homeless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
