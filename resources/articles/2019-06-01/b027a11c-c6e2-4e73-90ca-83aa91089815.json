When the Black and Whites have been bad this season, they have been abysmal: with four defeats by 30 points or more already in 2019. At half-time here, the prospect of a fifth was not entirely impossible, either. But when this Hull side click, they are a match for anyone - and having trailed 14-4 at half-time, to eventually win by the margin they did here at Castleford tells you all you need to know about their title credentials this season. \u201cOur season is being remembered for those four losses - but maybe we\u2019ve got some big wins to come,\u201d their coach, Lee Radford, said afterwards. Hull are now third following this comeback victory at fifth-placed Castleford, with a six-point cushion over the sides outside the play-off places to boot. Nothing is decided in June, but what is guaranteed is that this side, with such an array of talent, are clearly capable of lasting the distance between now and October. First-half tries from Greg Minikin and Junior Moors, coupled with three goals from Peter Mata\u2019utia, had put the Tigers on course to leapfrog Hull into third themselves here at half-time. Hull had struggled to cope with the miserable conditions in West Yorkshire during that half, with Ratu Naulago\u2019s try all they could muster. How they emerged a different team after half-time, though. Within ten minutes they were ahead thanks to Naulago\u2019s second and a wonderful breakaway try from Albert Kelly: both of which were assisted by Jake Connor. The England international\u2019s night was far from over too; having laid Naulago\u2019s first on a plate, he did the same for Kelly soon after for his second. That came after Greg Eden temporarily levelled the scores at 18-18, but even then, it was clear Hull were in the ascendancy. Kelly\u2019s try made it 24-18, before the half-back completed a wonderful hat-trick with another breakaway try. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty to go, but I\u2019m going to enjoy this,\u201d was Radford\u2019s closing remark. Given what his team have put him through this year, few would begrudge him that pleasure.
