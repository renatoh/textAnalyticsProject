In 2018, a report by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, published by Reuters, found that direct and indirect emissions from livestock comprise 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions over a global life cycle. For the ecologically conscious, the question of whether or not you can consume dairy and still call yourself an environmentalist has never been more fraught. But although sustainability is an increasingly critical imperative for the dairy industry, the implications of consuming dairy are inseparable from complex food systems and the way we think about environmental footprints as a whole. Here, our expert panel debunk myths around whether or not consuming dairy always means compromising green ideals. We should be fostering more sustainable forms of dairy production Mark Miers: Farming to us means protecting nature and people in the long term. For that, we have to be trustworthy and transparent and that gives currency to our operation. [At Ingleby Farms] we monitor and record animal comfort, our water and soil quality, and our biodiversity. These indicators help create traceable, wholesome food. From the data collected we can adapt our processes to accommodate different environmental strategies for each farm. Ultimately, we are humble \u2018hands on\u2019 farmers. We are in the paddocks caring for our animals and crops. We also understand that there is a scientific practice to improving the management of our farms. People forget the benefits of free-range livestock production. It creates healthy soil and biodiversity. Cattle manure promotes nutrients which improves soil structure. With well-managed grazing operations, we see more plant mass growing both above and below the ground. We are working tirelessly to look after an environment that we care about so much. We live in a time where everyone wants to understand that their food is being produced sustainably, safely and that animals are being looked after. But [in terms of] the processes of producing food, very little is known. The science based understanding of how [dairy farming] contributes to emissions needs to improve. As consumer demand changes, the perception of what \u2018good\u2019 looks like changes as well. The modern dairy farmer must navigate this dynamic and change management to adapt. Consumers demand ethically produced products, traceability is vital. We should be encouraging sustainable forms of dairy production. It\u2019s about working alongside nature and achieving that cycle of life. Mark Miers is a farmer at Ingleby Farms Sustainable farming practices need to become more transparent Professor David Lindenmayer: Pressures around dairy farming and the environment come when you push the system and intensify things in a significant way. One of the key things associated with sustainability are practices at the individual farm level. It\u2019s important to make sure that there are parts of the farm that haven\u2019t been cleared, that there are riparian areas and patches of remnant vegetation. There is a lot of work to be done - by farmers at the micro level and then there\u2019s the scientific monitoring needed to generate information to continuously improve conditions on farms. There is an argument for what we consume relative to its impact on the planet. It\u2019s interesting that people are looking at alternative technologies associated with growing lab meat and lab-grown dairy products. But there is still substantial demand for dairy products and we have to think about the kinds of environments that they come from. If you [prioritise] sustainable management of the vegetation on your land by increasing the amount of replanting and thinking about how you deal with the quality of water on your farm, there can be substantial biodiversity benefits. It is possible to consume dairy products and be an environmentalist but it is important to ensure that these are produced in a sustainable way. Most Australians would be horrified to understand the extent of environmental change associated with extensive land clearing. There needs to be certification schemes that deal with these issues of what is produced where and by whom - a bit like the timber industry. Professor David Lindenmayer is a scientist and academic at ANU College of Science There are environmental trade-offs whether you consume dairy or not Brad Ridoutt: There\u2019s a problem when people zoom in on one context aspect of the environmental sector without looking at sustainable of healthy diets [as a whole]. At CSIRO, we recently learned that dairy in Australian diets represented 10% of the carbon footprint and 15% of the water footprint, which in other words, means that 90% of greenhouse gas emissions are coming from other kinds of food groups. Dairy has to do everything it can to reduce its environmental footprint, but so does every other part of our food industry. If you are interested in healthy and sustainable diets, it\u2019s more about eating core foods than avoiding specific food groups. In Australia, on average, a third of diets are made up of discretionary [or junk] foods that lead to overconsumption of food energy, gaps in nutrient intake, and inflation of environmental impacts. Most environmental impacts are also highly simply correlated with how much food energy you can consume overall. According to studies we\u2019ve done around greenhouse gas emissions, if more people ate according to Australian Dietary Guidelines, greenhouse gas emissions would go down by 12 percent on average. And in this case, people would be consuming more dairy and meat. We\u2019ve also looked at the water footprint of dairy alternatives and some have a lower water footprint, and some have a higher water footprint - so even if you stop drinking dairy, it\u2019s not that simple. There are trade-offs and it\u2019s not such a straightforward issue. [In terms of sustainability], it\u2019s best if you can consume an appropriate amount of food and avoid wasting it. Brad Ridoutt is the Principal Research Scientist with CSIRO There\u2019s no doubt that the dairy industry needs to move towards a more sustainable and transparent model - their sustainability framework is a step in the right direction. But factors such as the complexity of food systems and the difficulty of measuring the environmental footprints associated with alternative dairy sources means that the decision to stop drinking dairy isn\u2019t always the best way to spark change. Steps such as choosing dairy producers carefully and thinking about the sustainability of your diet holistically could mean putting environmental principles in action in a more effective way.
