Birju Salla, 38, who is married with two children, planted a letter in the toilet of a Jet Airways plane claiming there were 12 hijackers onboard the Mumbai-Delhi flight, prompting an emergency landing in Ahmedabad. The court heard that Salla hoped the airline would close as a result of the hoax in October 2017, leaving his girlfriend jobless and free to enjoy his company more often. The court of the National Investigation Agency in Ahmedabad fined Salla 50m rupees (\u00a3565,000), in addition to the jail sentence. He is the first person to be convicted under stringent anti-hijacking laws introduced in 2016, which allow for only two punishments for hijacking or threats to hijack: life or a death sentence. The court was told that Salla lived with with his wife, sons and his elderly parents in a flat in Mumbai. His diamond trading business allowed him a life of luxury including business-class travel, and some in the industry who knew him said he had a penchant for meeting celebrities During his frequent flights from Mumbai to Delhi he fell for a flight attendant and they began an affair in 2017. He became frustrated that her job meant he could not spend as much time with her as he wanted. In July 2017 he married her secretly and asked her to leave her job, but she refused to so. Prosecutors told the court that Salla then hatched in his plan, writing a note in English on his office computer and using Google Translate to turn it into Urdu, presumably to make it appear as though it was written by a Muslim. The note read: \u201cFlight No 9W339 is covered by hijackers and aircraft should not be land and flown straight to POK [Muzaffarabad airport in Pakistan], 12 people onboard. If you put landing gear, you will hear the noise of people dying. Don\u2019t take it as a joke. Cargo area contains explosives land Delhi. Allah is great.\u201d He printed it out, taking care to use plastic gloves \u2013 captured on his office CCTV \u2013 so as not to leave fingerprints. After boarding the flight on 30 October 2017, Salla went to the toilet and left the note easily visible in a tissue box. A member of the cabin crew saw it and alerted the pilot, who made an emergency landing. The National Investigation Agency traced the hoax threat to Salla and arrested him last year for posing a threat to the safety of passengers and crew. According to Indian media reports, Salla remains in touch with his girlfriend, who is said to be \u201cshattered and heartbroken\u201d at what she feels is a disproportionate punishment for a \u201cprank\u201d. The Mumbai Mirror quoted the woman\u2019s sister as saying she considered herself to be Salla\u2019s wife as the marriage was registered in court. \u201cRapists go scot-free in this country, terrorism is on the rise and here an innocent man has been convicted of an alleged hoax,\u201d the sister said. \u201cAn injustice has been done. He didn\u2019t put a gun to someone\u2019s head.\u201d Salla\u2019s lawyer, Rohit Verma, said the relationship with his wife and parents, who all attended court only once, was now strained. \u201cHe has been in jail since October 2017 so I suppose he is getting used to it by now,\u201d Verma said. He said the provisions of the law were so harsh that he planned to challenge its constitutionality in court. Salla\u2019s reaction was calm, he said, because he had understood there were only two sentencing options under the legislation. \u201cHe knew it was going to happen,\u201d Verma said. \u201cIf only he hadn\u2019t done something so stupid.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
