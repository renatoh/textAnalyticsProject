Morrison\u2019s proposal, which would involve Centrelink and employment service contractor staff reporting clients they suspected of using ice, has also been dismissed by a leading drug policy researcher as a \u201cthought bubble\u201d that would drive more criminal offending by addicts. Matt Noffs, the chief executive of the Ted Noffs Foundation, said he would marshall a contingent to \u201cbring the message to Sheriff Morrison that this is first and foremost an issue about humans and putting people above the ideas of law and order and discounting the lives of drug users\u201d. News Limited reported Morrison on Friday as saying ice addiction should not be treated as a health issue but a social \u201ctoxin\u201d that was destroying communities. \u201cIt\u2019s a social issue, it\u2019s a law and order issue,\u2019 he said. Morrison said the government was considering a plan to force users into rehab or have their welfare payments set aside for use on food and other essentials, under an expansion of a cashless welfare card being trialled in South Australia and Western Australia. Jake Najman, a University of Queensland sociology professor and director of the Queensland alcohol and drug research and education centre, said the proposal betrayed \u201can appalling ignorance of what the problem is\u201d. Najman said those with heavy levels of addiction often turned to various crimes to fund drug habits costing \u201cmany hundreds of dollars a week, in some cases thousands of dollars\u201d. \u201cWelfare payments, whatever they are, are not likely to amount to that kind of money,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are already breaking the law in a dozen different ways and quarantining welfare payments will just simply make it worse. \u201cThe minister simply doesn\u2019t understand anything about the nature of amphetamine use in Australia and the likely impacts that what he\u2019s suggesting may or may not have.\u201d Najman said the body of international experience on drug policy showed that \u201ctrying to punish people into not doing what they\u2019re doing has simply just not worked\u201d. \u201cYou might get a level of satisfaction from punishing people who are doing something you don\u2019t like them doing \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to actually make a difference,\u201d he said. Noffs said that Morrison was preempting the outcome of the government\u2019s national task force on ice, which had already framed the issue as one of health over law and order. \u201cWhen Morrison comes out saying this, the problem I have with it is he\u2019s acting like a tough guy in the schoolyard but he hasn\u2019t been paying attention in science class because he\u2019s not looking at the evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going against the word of people like [ice task force head] Ken Lay who said we can\u2019t arrest our way out of this issue.\u201d Noffs said the group he would take to Canberra would include \u201cyoung people who are using or coming off drugs, as well as adults who are functional users of drugs including ice, as well as dysfunctional people\u201d. \u201cWe had that rhetoric around heroin users but I don\u2019t think we ever went down that track of quarantining welfare for heroin users,\u201d Noffs said. \u201cOur health response does work and we need to remember that drug users, both functional and dysfunctional, are human beings.\u201d Najman said attempts by untrained bureaucrats to detect ice habits through observation would miss the \u201cvast majority\u201d of users, two-thirds of whom consumed the drug only occasionally. \u201cYou might pick up the most affected \u2013 but you worry about that because a lot of people who are using drugs have morbid mental health problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, will people who lack the expertise be able to tell the difference between someone who\u2019s got a mental health problem and someone who\u2019s addicted or someone who\u2019s got both?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
