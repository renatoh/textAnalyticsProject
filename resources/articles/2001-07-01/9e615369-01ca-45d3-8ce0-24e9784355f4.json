Both companies said they were in talks to see why they had been left off the list. But their efforts are certain to fail before the index goes live at the end of the month. Other high profile companies left off the list include Marconi and the Daily Mail. A spokesman for Tesco says: \"We think the reason for not being included was because of the way we present data in out annual report. We believe we do all the things that other companies on the list do. Things like computers for schools and our work with Macmillan Cancer Relief shows that we are very involved in the community.\" A spokesman for RBS says: \"It's not what's printed but what you do that matters. Nevertheless we will be talking to the people who drew up the list to see why we were left off.\" The FTSE4Good indices have been compiled by FTSE International and the charitable Ethical Investment Research Service. They are designed to provide a tool for investors to track the performance of socially responsible companies in the UK, European, US and global markets. Companies that sell tobacco, armaments or are involved in nuclear power were not considered for the list. Other companies that failed to report on the effect they have on the environment or how they are socially responsible also fell by the wayside. Tesco failed to include a section on its environmental impact in its annual report. RBS invests in Indonesia, a country where bribery, child labour and other undesirable practices take place. The company was not condemned for making the investments, but on its failure to publish a human rights policy. FTSE4Good stresses that the indices are an attempt to create an open and transparent formula for reporting that allows investors to see easily which firms conform and those that don't. It is likely that by next year when Tesco and RBS produce their 2002 annual reports they will comply with the format laid down by FTSE4Good and will be included in the list. Employers organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, said while it recognised the indices provided information that some investors want, it felt there was \"a danger firms included might be seen as 'good' and those left off as 'bad'. \" It also condemned the fact that firms like Tesco and RBS had not seen in advance the criteria used to compile the indices. From the opposite end of the spectrum, environmental and human rights groups condemned the inclusion of certain oil and drugs companies. The Free Tibet Campaign criticised the inclusion of BP as \"inappropriate\", while Friends of the Earth expressed concern about the environmental record of some pharmaceutical companies and others firms on the list. The differences of opinion highlight the difficulties of drawing up lists of ethical companies. But Paul Webster of the ethical research group that helped compile the list says its introduction will boost the sales of ethical pensions, Isas and other personal finance products. \"While a number of surveys show that as 70% of the public would like to invest their money ethically when they are asked about it as few as 20% are aware of that possibility.\" It is expected that many company pension funds, under pressure to make greater investment in socially responsible companies, will track the indices The eight indices will be: FTSE4Good UK, FTSE4Good UK 50, FTSE4Good Europe, FTSE4Good Europe 50, FTSE4Good US (not yet available), FTSE4Good US 100, FTSE4Good Global (not yet available), FTSE4Good Global 100 Index The ins and outs The main UK index, likes its seven cousins, is made up of companies that either steer clear of industries such as tobacco, nuclear power and arms manufacturing or dabble in undesirable countries or industries but produce reports which show they are untainted by bad practice.
