The report, from The Boston Consulting Group and totaljobs.com said nearly one in six of those questioned (16%) want to work in London, the survey of more than 200,000 people from 188 countries showed. Sydney, Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin, Toronto, Singapore and Rome made up the rest of the top 10 cities, respectively. Mike Booker, international director at totaljobs.com, said: \u201cThis report cements London\u2019s reputation as a truly global city. Not only does it offer a wealth of job opportunities in a range of industries, but it boasts some of the world\u2019s top cultural attractions, so it\u2019s no surprise that people across the globe want to come and work here.\u201d He noted that both London and New York already have a high population of foreign-born workers, about 3 million in each city. But while seven US cities are in the top 40 most desirable cities for work, no other UK cities feature. Booker said: \u201cIf people want to move to the UK, they want to move to London.\u201d Booker highlighted the prominence of the finance industry as well as high salary prospects, public healthcare and cultural diversity.

They\u2019ll never say Liverpool or Manchester. They all say London because of the cultural harmonisation.\u201d Booker said about Paris: \u201cIt really comes down to the cultural element. Economically and politically and from a level of recruitment, things really are tough there, but it has global appeal.\u201d The UK is the second most-appealing country for international jobseekers after the US, with 37% saying they want to work in the UK, against 42% for the US.
