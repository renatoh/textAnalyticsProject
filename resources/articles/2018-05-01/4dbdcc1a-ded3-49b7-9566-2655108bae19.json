More than 800 students wrote an open letter to the institution\u2019s vice-chancellor demanding the change in policy, saying the criminal standard currently required, which calls for allegations to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, was putting some people off coming forward. Instead, disciplinary proceedings should adopt the civil standard, demanding only that allegations be proven on the balance of probability, the students said. Doing so would \u201cgive survivors and victims of sexual assault more confidence\u201d to report wrongdoing. The students added that, under the current system, the university is \u201cimplying that there is unlikely to be consequences for perpetrators in disciplinary cases pertaining to sexual misconduct, unless the survivor goes to the police\u201d. They said the criminal standard of proof places \u201cundue burden on someone who has experienced a traumatic event\u201d, adding that it \u201cactively discourages survivors and victims of sexual harassment, rape and assault from engaging with the disciplinary procedure.\u201d The letter to Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor Stephen Toope was written by the Cambridge University Students\u2019 Union Women\u2019s Campaign. It claimed Cambridge was the only UK university to require the criminal standard in disciplinary cases and came to light after Cambridge launched a consultation proposing the burden of proof be lowered. \u201cThe University of Cambridge is not a criminal court and it should not behave as such. The penalties that may be inflicted on a student by the university have no effect on their criminal record or their standing in the eyes of the law,\u201d said the students\u2019 letter. In February, the institution admitted it has \u201ca significant problem\u201d with sexual misconduct after it received nearly 180 complaints in nine months under its newly launched anonymous reporting system. A document released as part of the university\u2019s consultation process acknowledged receipt of the letter. It said: \u201cThe review committee on student discipline are of the view that if the student body wants the university to use the balance of probability as the standard of proof when considering allegations of student misconduct then this should be accepted by the university community. However, the committee noted that it is unclear whether this is the view of the student body.\u201d On Wednesday, the head of the university\u2019s office for student conduct, complaints and appeals, Sarah D\u2019Ambrumenil, said: \u201cThe university is currently in a period of consultation about the disciplinary procedure \u2013 the discussion is an ideal opportunity for all members of the university to bring forward their views about the standard of proof. \u201cThis will enable the review committee on discipline to reach the best decision for the university, which would ultimately be subject to further university consultation, but we cannot pre-judge what that decision will be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
