Two weeks ago she got a call saying the interview was cancelled. \u201cI feel so sad and frustrated. I\u2019d been nervous about leaving uni and getting an interview was really exciting,\u201d she says. Many are in similar positions. Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. \u201cBecause of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt won\u2019t be possible anymore.\u201d Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a global recession. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year. While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. \u201cThousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,\u201d says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. \u201cWe need to make sure that a whole generation isn\u2019t lost.\u201d One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. \u201cFirms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months\u2019 time.\u201d Routes into graduate jobs have also been affected. Short-term work such as internships and placements will be reduced by almost a third, say the ISE, and 68% of firms have cancelled work experience and taster opportunities. As a result, almost 40% of students are now worried they won\u2019t be able to get a job at all. James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don\u2019t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: \u201cInternships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.\u201d Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. \u201cEven in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.\u201d Students can also rely on their university careers\u2019 services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera. Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master\u2019s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that individuals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. \u201cI live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I\u2019m currently looking into doing a master\u2019s,\u201d she says. \u201cThe easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.\u201d James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. \u201cWe need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,\u201d he says. Hillman agrees. \u201cYou can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
