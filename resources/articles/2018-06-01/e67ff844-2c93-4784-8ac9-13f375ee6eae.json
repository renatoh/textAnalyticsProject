Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad depart on Tuesday for their base in Repino, on the Gulf of Finland near St Petersburg, eager to make a mark in Russia. Kane failed to register under Roy Hodgson at Euro 2016, or at the Under-21s European Championship the previous summer, but is confident he will thrive at the head of a vibrant, attack-minded group. \u201cThe aim is to be aggressive and brave in possession,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are trying to instil into the team. We want to take this tournament head on. There will be tough moments, and ups and downs. Sometimes going into a big tournament is about not losing and being passive but, for us, it\u2019s about playing attacking football. We are aiming to win the first game, then to target the second, and take that attitude to the World Cup. \u201cPersonally, that [scoring] record is something I want to change, and hopefully will this summer. I\u2019ve always felt you go through spells: the ball goes in sometimes and other times it doesn\u2019t, like in August every year for me. That\u2019s part of the game. But I always look at my game and see how I can get better, so that\u2019s making an impact in big tournaments. Obviously that\u2019s only one senior finals for me so far, but there is the under-21s as well. But I want to score in tournament football and that\u2019s what I will try to do.\u201d Kane had featured in Nice when England departed Euro 2016 in ignominious fashion to Iceland, but he senses memories of that desperate occasion will not haunt those survivors from Hodgson\u2019s squad who are travelling to Russia. \u201cIt was a down, a bad moment for us, and I\u2019m confident it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t say 100% it won\u2019t happen because you never know in football, but in this team we wear our heart on our sleeves. We are proud to be here, we will work hard, be energetic. \u201cWe have a lot of attacking flair, too, who can do some damage. We are young and inexperienced so it is a good thing to go out there and be free and hungry to prove ourselves on the biggest stage. \u201cIt is hard to look beyond the World Cup, the biggest sporting event in the world. It is the one competition everybody dreams of winning. Obviously I understand you\u2019ve got the Champions League and Premier League \u2013 so many big competitions \u2013 every season. But, for me, I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger than the World Cup. \u201cI would love to win everything with Tottenham but, for me personally, the World Cup outweighs them all,\u201d Kane added. \u201cI am proud to be English and I would do anything for my country. Football plays such a big part in that, so to make the fans proud and country proud would be an incredible feeling. We feel we can do that. All we can do is fight on the pitch and give 100% in every game and wear that badge with pride. I am sure the country will take to that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
