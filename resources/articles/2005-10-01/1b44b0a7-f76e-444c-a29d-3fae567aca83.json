So when they indisputably prove they are, it's particularly galling (ignore the dreadful pun, that's the kind of thing we really should be better at). There's one area of life, though, where they win hands down - eating out. Because as a nation, they have a smooth, innate understanding of waiter service, restaurant etiquette and, most importantly, the mechanics of tipping. In Britain, tipping waiters is a minefield, fraught with tension, imminent faux pas and acute social embarrassment. Our national catchphrase since 1939 has been \"mustn't grumble\" and it beats in our heads even as waiters snarl, forget basic orders and treat their diners like difficult children who should be grateful for a chance to stay up late. I was at a restaurant in Manchester the other night, and when I ordered the Malayan chicken the waiter boldly announced: \"I recommend the rosemary and garlic potatoes to accompany that.\" I told him he could recommend whatever he liked but I loathed rosemary with a passion and would have the spinach. He shrugged and I resented being instructed on what I should eat, as if choosing something else had been a gastronomic failure on my part. And frankly, I didn't like the cut of his cocky jib. But, of course, when the meal was over, I stumped up, handing over a generous tip because I was afraid of seeming mean. Later that night, we went to a fancy bar where the waiter glared and initially refused to serve us because we were a party of eight. Then he brought the wrong drinks, left half of us waiting for 20 minutes for the right ones and generally treated us like cockroaches that had cunningly discovered a legal loophole allowing us to drink in his bar. Of course we tipped him. There is no Gallic hierarchy of tipping here, no hushed, gliding waiters who've learned the trade at their father's aproned knee, garnering a higher rate of gratuity than pustule-ridden 16-year-olds slapping down a pizza. All I know is, if you go out for dinner you're expected to leave between 10% and 15%, depending on how good you are at maths. And a refusal to leave a tip is fighting talk. Waiters will argue that because they're paid so poorly, tips are essential to give them the chance of a living wage. In some restaurants, that's probably true. But there are hundreds of poorly paid jobs - shop assistant, nursing auxiliary, call-centre worker - that don't automatically carry the expectation that grateful customers will make up the shortfall. If I'm already paying \u00a38 over the odds for a plate of pasta that cost about 40p to produce, is it also my responsibility to make sure that the grumpy teen banging it down in front of me has enough money to go out on Friday night? Certain top restaurateurs refuse to employ British staff because they're just not servile enough. They have never been suitably trained in hors d'oeuvres. Most waiters, in fact, are simply using the job as a stopgap on their way to something more lucrative and enjoyable. In Britain, maitre d' is only marginally more viable a career choice than lion tamer. And yet we leave huge guilty gestures of thanks on the saucer of mints because restaurants are too tightfisted to pay or train their staff properly. It's our own fault, though. If we weren't so afraid of appearing to \"grumble\", so ridden with puritan guilt at the very idea that we dare to eat out at all, we might be able to explain why, sometimes, we don't tip. And why on other occasions, when the service is fabulous, we do so generously. But we're not French - and besides, we're all too scared that if we don't leave money, next time they'll spit in our food. If they do, we'll show them we mean business. We'll only tip them 12%, at most. flic@fliceverett.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
