Benjamin fell over twice and the result was a goal and a penalty, more grist to the comedy mill in front of Franchise FC's lowest gate of the season so far - 2,165 and all but 900 or so in the visitors' end. First joke of the day went to Wimbledon's chairman Charles Koppel, Dr Death to his friends, who wrote in his programme notes: \"Our home attendance for [last week's] Wolves match was 30% more than for the previous match against Brighton. It was great to see and feel the passion of all supporters so obviously getting behind the team.\" For the record, a 30% improvement represented about 230 extra punters who barely raised a coherent cheer between them. If Wimbledon's Milton Keynes experiment, perish the thought, ends in disaster and bankruptcy, Koppel can always apply for employment as Kim Jong-il's press secretary. His manager Stuart Murdoch is less inclined towards distortions of reality and thinks his team's acclimatisation to the eerily empty stands may be working in their favour, though he concedes he cannot wait for the move north, due in December. Wimbledon have played two of the more fancied teams in the division in the past fortnight, scoring five and conceding the same. \"If we play exciting football, which we have been doing, I expect people will come to see us,\" said Murdoch, and no toddler in the land is anticipating Christmas with such relish. Leicester had brought the gifts though: Mark Williams's header and Neil Shipperley's cutely curled free-kick left them for dead after 15 minutes. \"I think if teams come down here and don't get used to the lack of atmosphere they will be in trouble. It's not usual for a First Division game,\" said Adams. \"But it shouldn't matter to the players if they play in front of five or 50,000.\" The grizzly centre-back Gerry Taggart seemed most affected, huffing and wheezing as Jobi McAnuff, jet-heeled and jinking, played tormentor-in-chief. McAnuff, although right-footed, is a poor man's Damien Duff and should expect temptation from the Premiership when the transfer window re-opens. Adams put Taggart out of his misery after 41 minutes - \"we weren't at the races as a back four\" - and threw on Benjamin, changing his formation to 4-3-3. By half-time Leicester were level, the striker colliding with Alan Rogers's cross then tumbling under Shipperley's challenge to gift Muzzy Izzet a penalty. It was a landmark day for the Leicester bench; Jordan Stewart was introduced just before the hour and made his boss look a genius by swerving in a worthy winner from five yards outside the box. The three points vaulted Leicester to second, not bad for a club staggering under a Premiership-sized wage bill and the costs of a new stadium, not to mention the pre-season pugilism that saw Dennis Wise sacked, pending appeal, and Callum Davidson left with a fractured jaw.
