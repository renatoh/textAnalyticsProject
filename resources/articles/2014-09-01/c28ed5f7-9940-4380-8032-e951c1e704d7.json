The first is my children live in Edinburgh, so I'm thrilled that they haven't become foreigners. The second is that I have had my own belief in my political prognostications fantastically boosted. I am Nostradamus, because I told my wife yesterday it was going to be 55/45. As a historian I'm now not going to have to write about Britain and Scotland constantly \u2013 instead we can stick to the original formula and not need to differentiate between the two countries, which makes life an awful lot easier for someone in my profession. Now, finally, there actually is the political impetus to ensure that Scots MPs do not any longer vote on purely English and Welsh legislation. If we have devo max, there has to be a quid pro quo. Dame Janet Suzman actress starring in Solomon and Marion in Birmingham and London this autumn I'm thrilled because, with great respect to a pretty huge chunk of the Scottish populace, they were being sold a nationalism which is out of date. People get very excited about their own tribes. But actually, if you analyse the world, that's the problem. It's tribal, the wrong way to go in a global world. We all have to help each other because machinery has pushed us closer together, not further apart. Sentiments were whipped up. People are given an agenda. They think: \"Something to believe in \u2013 fabulous.\" People are very persuadable. Scotland is a country of genius. But it's more of a genius when it's joined to another genius. [On the promise of more power] Cameron seems to me to be known for panicking. Maybe he has panicked, but he's now got to deliver. They've got a really tough job to do it in the time he's proposed. Devolution, the anti-Thatcher movement \u2013 in other words, giving power to the provinces instead of Westminster \u2013 is absolutely the right way to go. Brian Cox actor, whose films include Braveheart Of course I was disappointed. But there was a confliction because I was also very proud of the fact that we had actually in Scotland shown the meaning of social democracy. This was politics by the people rather than the politicians. That's what I think has really stood out about this whole thing, because the politicians \u2013 particularly the Westminster politicians \u2013 have failed miserably. I'm not a Scottish nationalist, I'm an independent. But I do feel that Alex Salmond has shown himself head and shoulders the best political leader in the UK. Miliband, Clegg, Cameron \u2013 the \"three amigos\" as I call them \u2013 the disconnect was absolutely astonishing. They shot themselves in the foot. They couldn't have done better than just held up their foot and shot off each toe individually. I have very little faith in their promises. Michael Caton-Jones the Scottish director of Rob Roy I woke up to a huge thunderstorm in London at 2am or 3am, really heavy, which I took as an omen. I was quite depressed by the whole affair. I'm actually somewhat ashamed of what happened and of some of my fellow countrymen for being so easily suckered by the media, by the promises, the shameless and habitual liars, these politicians promising the earth, when it was just tawdry and hollow promises. A lot of people just were scared. There are a couple of things I'm extraordinarily proud of, the way that everybody was engaged, the realisation that here was something that a lot of countries shed a lot of blood for. To me, it was never about independence. I have no problem with the English, or Britain. I just think it's about self-determination, and just a more fair society. [On the politicians' promises] sadly I have no faith that they will deliver on anything. Steven Berkoff actor, writer and director, whose films include A Clockwork Orange and Octopussy I'm more than delighted with the result. Much as I love Scotland \u2013 and I've spent a great deal of time in Scotland, I've done at least 20 Edinburgh festivals. The whole idea of agitating for a referendum by this man Salmond, and even recruiting children as young as 16, who have not a glimmer of the history and the connections that bind our nations ... It was the most immoral kind of decision to create this schism between us. It was one of the most immoral and political acts I have come across in years. It's probably one of the few times I've felt passionate about being an Englishman. Arlene Foster Democratic Unionist party minister in the Belfast devolved government On the Scotland result there will be no champagne corks popping. I will celebrate by going to my constituency office in Enniskillen. For the most westerly constituency of the United Kingdom, it's business as usual. I will mark this by listening to constituents. I think the Scottish vote reaffirms our belief in the union as being important right across the UK. It is absolutely true that grassroots unionists over here will take comfort from the Scottish vote. Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society When it comes to science, it is \"better together\": it worked well for me as a young English researcher when I spent seven years at the University of Edinburgh. Scientific research is crucial for long-term sustainable economic growth in a country like ours, where we cannot rely on cheap labour or natural resources. Fortunately the UK has a science base that is the envy of the world in terms of quality and efficiency. That success is built on permeability, interactions between people, a critical mass of researchers, and funding that is based on excellence. Wherever excellence is found in the UK, all of UK science benefits from it. Scotland profits from this, with 8.4% of the population of the UK but with Scottish researchers attracting 13.1% of UK Research Council money in 2012-13, demonstrating how permeable the border is. And the rest of UK science benefits in turn from excellent research in Scotland. Joe Anderson mayor of Liverpool One thing that's clear about the Scottish referendum results is that everyone who voted \u2013 yes or no \u2013 has voted for change. The vote, and the campaign that led up to it, has sent a great signal that people are sick and tired of a Westminster system which has led to governments, both past and present, creating one of the most centralised countries in the world. As a result, we must change the way we talk about politics in this country. I have been campaigning against the Barnett formula since I became leader of Liverpool four years ago and saw for myself the critical unfairness in the funding system for local government. Frank Cottrell Boyce writer So now we know what it takes to create an engaged, ambitious, passionate electorate \u2013 give the people a chance to break away from Westminster. Everything that half of Scotland felt about the political establishment \u2013 that it was remote, corrupt and disengaged \u2013 is also felt not just in Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales, but also in Hackney and Hastings. It's not Britain that's broken; it's Westminster. The only people who feel that they have a voice in government are bankers and multinationals. The problem is not geographical. So the solution is not federal. We need a bold new covenant between the people and their politicians. You could start by moving parliament out of London \u2013 away from the temptations of the lobby and the housing market. Many great world cities \u2013 Mumbai, Sydney, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 do not have to double as seats of administration. If we want to keep the United Kingdom, then it has to become a nation once again. At the moment it's a borough with a very big hinterland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
