Few would be surprised to see Hawthorn and Geelong sitting first and second, as they\u2019ve so often done since 2008, but with the early rounds often producing anomalous results, it has taken until now for some trends to become clear. Richmond and Sydney were both pre-season fancies for the top four, but lost again this weekend to entrench themselves in the bottom six. Their early-season radar blips have become a fleet of Space Invaders. Carlton look set for a season of struggle, their hopeful summer dissolving into a bleak autumn. West Coast are about to ride a theme-park waterslide: they were first with a bullet after three easy fixtures, but have dropped to fourth after they couldn\u2019t find a goal in three quarters against the Cats. As for teams on the upsurge, Port Adelaide and North Melbourne are the ones to realise their predicted gains. Port leapt to third, while the Roos beat them last week and only trail them on percentage. Both have had a soft win or two, but the scale of Port\u2019s win and the ease of North\u2019s were impressive in different ways. Fremantle put their hands up too, with one finger extended at the Bombers. The Giants, meanwhile, are still in the eight after four rounds. Hands up who picked that? Round four? That\u2019s a paddlin\u2019 Like a mass-scale ballet of Tom Brown\u2019s School Days, this round was all about humiliation and floggings. Port\u2019s was the most dramatic, turning on every trick they could to better Brisbane by 113 points. Hawthorn laughed off Gold Coast\u2019s improvement to win by 99, Adelaide shrugged off three losses to beat St Kilda by 86, and Essendon were flattered by four late goals to lose by 53. In fact the slenderest win this round was Melbourne by 23. The Bulldogs stayed tight with the Giants but kicked away late by 27. Across nine matches, the average losing margin was 61.88 points. A miserable weekend for half the league, then. It\u2019s not often you see a team kick their last goal of the match during the first quarter, but after Jack Darling\u2019s set shot just before quarter time, the Eagles would add only seven behinds. This on a night when Dean Cox set a new games record for the club. Up at Metricon, Gold Coast coach Guy McKenna just said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming\u201d, presumably while rocking and staring into the middle distance. Melbourne get that one clean run Sometimes, life is all about that one clean run. When you hit 23 green lights in a row on a deserted trip down one of your city\u2019s worst roads. When the answer comes to you encased in crystal. When everything, for a brief and glorious moment, just works. That\u2019s what happened to Melbourne on Saturday afternoon. They so often battle against a world gone wrong. They so often contribute to it being so. With Carlton edging within three goals, and several minutes left, there was the thought that Melbourne may have forgotten how to win after losing since the middle of last season. Then the moment came. Dean Kent took a diving half-forward mark from Jack Viney. He found James Frawley just outside the 50, who chipped inboard to Lynden Dunn, who went into the pocket to Cameron Pedersen. Carlton\u2019s Nick Graham didn\u2019t even get to the contest but somehow Pedersen spilled the sliding chest mark. Classic Melbourne \u2013 until Pedersen somehow recovered first, found his feet, snared the ball just inside the boundary paint, and from the wrong side for a right foot, squeezed a kick away just as he was hit. It chipped up like a golf wedge, wobbled in the autumn air as though weighing up its options, and barely cleared Dale Thomas on the goal-line as it found the chink of daylight between the posts. New Geelong generations keep generating Geelong seem to have a magic football factory down the highway, given how readily replacements slot into the senior side. Half of their team on the weekend weren\u2019t around three or four years ago, but the standard has barely dipped. From the moment that Cameron Guthrie grabbed the first centre clearance, this weekend was a breakout game for a few recent Cats. Guthrie racked up 24 touches and nine tackles as a tagger. George Horlin-Smith had 12 contested possessions among his 23, ended up under plenty of packs, and complemented five inside-50s with three smart goals. Recycled defender Jared Rivers topped the marks tally with 12, roaming the ground to intercept and spoil, while the Cats\u2019 new three-part ruck division matched it with Dean Cox and Nic Naitanui. Ford may go, but one Geelong industry rolls on. Shaun Higgins needs protective custody If you visit StarTrack Oval, bring a towel. That was the message out of Canberra, where one of GWS\u2019s holiday homes was appropriately covered in sand. It was hardly a day off for Shaun Higgins, though. The newly-minted defender learned how hard that job can be when Giant forward Jeremy Cameron leapt into a marking contest and drove a hefty knee square into Higgins\u2019 ribs. Having recovered, Higgins drifted forward in the last quarter to leap for a mark, but was tunnelled and crashed down flat on his back. Gasping and winded for a second time, he dragged himself to the sideline as the umpire ignored the blatant free kick and the ball rebounded for a goal at the other end. Justice came later, Higgins benefitting from a 50-metre penalty to kick the sealer for the Bulldogs. Still, next time he hits the beach he might want mirror shades and a fake passport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
