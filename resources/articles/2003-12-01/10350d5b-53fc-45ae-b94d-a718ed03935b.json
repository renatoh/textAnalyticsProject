Only a dozen other players were there, even though the cup kicks off in less than seven weeks' time when the Hornets play the Russians of Moscow Dinamo. But Goulding is looking on the bright side, the enthusiasm he displayed as a scrum-half for eight clubs - including Wigan, Widnes, St Helens and Leeds - now bubbling again. \"We're getting there now,\" he said. \"This time last week we would have struggled to pick a team for the Dubai sevens.\" \"It's been tough, very tough,\" admitted the 31-year-old, who until the end of last month had been out of the professional game for the first time since signing for Wigan as a teenager. \"Last week I could have put a blanket over my head and stood in a corner. We were supposed to have a training session but with the lack of numbers, there was no point. But now we're starting to put a side together.\" It is little more than a year since Goulding was on the brink of returning to the Super League but Leigh did not extend his contract after their defeat by Huddersfield in the Northern Ford Premiership grand final. Goulding kept his hand in by coaching Widnes St Maries, his local amateur club. He had the chance to return with Workington or Swinton but decided that neither was quite right. Then the former Wigan and Wales hooker Martin Hall resigned as coach of Rochdale after a consortium, which he had put together, failed to take over the club, and Goulding made himself available. When he did so, he was not aware of the scale of the problems at Spotland. Hornets may have finished third in National League One last season but their squad has since disintegrated because of serious financial problems. \"When I took over, we had nobody signed on.\" But Goulding believes he can assemble a squad good enough to survive in what promises to be the most competitive season outside the Super League for years, with Hull KR's appointment of the former Great Britain coach Malcolm Reilly showing their determination to challenge Halifax for the one promotion place. \"Malcolm is one of those people who I have always respected, and someone I'd like to be able to phone for advice as a coach, although whether he'll give it me now we're rivals in the same league, I'm not sure,\" said Goulding. \"Our main priority has got to be to stay in National League One - and build for the future.\" But first there is the Challenge Cup, a competition Goulding has won four times in five Wembley final appearances. \"If we can get through this first round, hopefully we can get one of the big boys, to help us generate some of the money the club really needs,\" he said. And assuming Goulding's Hornets beat Moscow Dinamo on February 7, no one in the game has such a high probability of being drawn against one of his former employers.
