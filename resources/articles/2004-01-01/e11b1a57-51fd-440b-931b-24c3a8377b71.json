Southampton's chairman Rupert Lowe travelled to France last week and is thought to have held preliminary talks with the 47-year-old. Perrin, who was sacked by Marseille last Wednesday, is precisely the type of coach Southampton want to take over from Gordon Strachan. Lowe has decided to appoint someone from the continent who is used to dealing with a squad full of internationals and has experience of leading teams in Europe. Perrin's first taste of the Champions League saw Marseille finish third in their group this season behind Real Madrid and Porto. Previously he had coached Troyes in the Uefa Cup, in 2001-02, when his team were knocked out by Leeds United in the second round. Perrin worked miracles at Troyes, whom he took from France's semi-professional fourth division into the top flight and then into Europe inside 10 years. His players there included the current Southampton defender Michael Svensson, who is sure to have given Perrin a glowing reference. Perrin left Troyes to coach Marseille in the summer of 2002 and swiftly regenerated that club. Marseille had finished ninth the season before he arrived, 22 points off the top, but Perrin took them into the Champions League at the first attempt and missed out on the title by three points. His recent dismissal followed a poor run, though Marseille were in the top 10 and the Uefa Cup when he departed. Asked yesterday whether Perrin was a target, a Southampton spokesperson said: \"At this stage we are not ruling anybody in or anybody out.\" A workaholic who had a nondescript career as a defender, Perrin was a player at Nancy when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was in charge there and was given his first coaching job at Nancy by the now Arsenal manager. Perrin, who has a degree in sports science, progressed from there to Troyes. He is a tough man, as a recent profile in Uefa's Champions League magazine high- lighted. \"Perrin has an aura,\" it stated. \"A tall, heavily built man, with a penetrating glare, he wouldn't look out of place next to Al Pacino in a gangster movie. The tales of his rollockings are legendary.\" Perrin is the man responsible for bringing the former Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez back to France with Marseille, and it was this move and the subsequent demotion of the Croatian goalkeeper Vedran Runje, a crowd favourite, which added to the perceived split between manager and squad, cited as one of the reasons for Perrin's dismissal by the Marseille president Christophe Bouchet. Perrin is one of a small number of candidates being considered by Southampton, who - contrary to reports - have not lined up the former Japan coach Philippe Troussier. Strachan is due to leave at the end of the season to take a break from management, though a change could come sooner. Speculation about the his future has been fuelled by the seemingly different explanations by Strachan and the club concerning the reason for the manager's eventual departure and when the decision to go was taken. Strachan explained that his decision to leave at the end of his contract was taken two years ago as a promise to his family and that there were \"other things\" he wanted to do, despite a club statement implying that he was leaving for medical reasons. The Southampton chairman has refused to rule out a change in the management before the end of the season, particularly if he believes the impending departure of Strachan is affecting the performance of the team. \u00b7 Steve Cotterill is expected to be named as Bristol Rovers' new manager in succession to Ray Graydon today, whose non appearance at Rochdale on Saturday led to speculation about his future. Graydon, a former Rovers' winger, is two years through a five-year contract. He said last week: \"People think I lack passion but they should see me over 24 hours and the efforts I put in for this club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
