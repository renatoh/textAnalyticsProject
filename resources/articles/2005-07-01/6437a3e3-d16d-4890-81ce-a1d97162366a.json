For the second year running, the Treasury said it was prepared to forego \u00a3100m in revenue rather than add to the financial burden on consumers and business from the 40% increase in crude since the start of the year. Gordon Brown announced in the budget in March that the government would wait until September before imposing the 1.22p a litre increase in duty, but the financial secretary to the Treasury, John Healey, said in a Commons statement yesterday that ministers would look again at the issue in the pre-budget report (PBR), which is normally in late November or early December. Despite increases in output from the Opec oil cartel, the price of crude was last night hovering just below $60 a barrel, raising the possibility that the increase for 2005-06 will be scrapped altogether in the PBR. The last increase in fuel duty came in 2003, and Mr Healey said the risk of volatility remained high. The move was strongly condemned by environmentalists. Greenpeace's executive director, Stephen Tindale, said: \"It just beggars belief. The day before Tony Blair welcomes world leaders to Gleneagles to broker a deal on climate change he shows himself incapable of taking even the most modest and obvious step here at home. The UN says 150,000 people are dying every year from climate change, we are in a crisis, and the prime minister is lecturing the world. But if his warnings are to have credibility the least he should do is defend the rise in fuel duty.\" In a separate move that will have an impact on long-term vehicle emissions, the transport secretary, Alistair Darling, yesterday signalled further government encouragement for local road pricing schemes - such as London's congestion charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
