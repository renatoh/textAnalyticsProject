Brazilian authorities have been investigating the growing disaster for more than a month, as the oil has spread to more than 130 beaches across nine states. On Wednesday, the country\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, told a congressional hearing that a study by the state oil company Petrobras had concluded that the oil \u201cis very likely from Venezuela\u201d. He said that a foreign ship near Brazil\u2019s coastline appeared to have caused the spill \u201caccidentally or not\u201d. Salles said that more than 100 tonnes of oil had already been collected from the coastline since 2 September, but said that the disaster was proving \u201cenormously difficult to contain\u201d. There was no immediate response from Venezuela, but the Brazilian assertion is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, is a longstanding critic of Venezuela\u2019s embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and has close relations with rightwing Venezuelan groups seeking his overthrow. Earlier this week, Bolsonaro dismissed speculation that the spill had been released by a sinking ship. \u201cIf it was a shipwreck, oil would still be coming up. It is more probable that something was dumped there criminally,\u201d he told reporters. Bolsonaro said he did not want to blame another country without proof, but hinted darkly: \u201cWe have a country on our radar screen that could be the origin of the oil.\u201d Petrobras\u2019s chief executive, Roberto Castello, said on Tuesday that the amount of oil spilled so far \u2013 approximately 500 barrels \u2013 was far too much to have been from the result of a routine tank cleaning. Social media users have shared shocking images of the spill, showing kilometers of white sand stained with oil blotches and dead, oil-covered turtles and dolphins. One video shows thick black oil lapping up against a rocky jetty. The oil\u2019s appearance came shortly after Brazil became the focus of international criticism over record wildfires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest \u2013 both of which have surged since Bolsonaro came to office. Environmentalists and indigenous leaders say that Bolsonaro\u2019s stripping back of environmental legislation and protections has stoked a fresh assault on the country\u2019s ecosystems. \u201cThe oil spill that\u2019s reached over 132 beaches in the north-east is criminal. Removing the residue from the ocean can take 10 to 20 years,\u201d said the former environment minister Marina Silva in a tweet. \u201cThis is a warning that we need to strengthen and not suffocate the environmental monitoring institutions in the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
