I wouldn't want Guardian readers to be left with the false impression that it was an edict handed down by some remote, teetotal, football-hating, middle-class elite. Neither do I want to give Mr Hunt indigestion, but the resolution also cited the excellent Revolt on the Clyde, by the abstemious but proletarian communist MP Willie Gallacher. Why sneer when trade unionists involved in today's bread-and-butter issues want to read about and discuss our movement's rich history and literature?
