But just look! What can you do?", "bodyText": "DEMBA, BAH! The Fiver is acutely aware that we\u2019ve been yammering on a bit too much recently about Manchester United and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and Frank O\u2019Farrell and Herbert Bamlett\u2019s 12 defeats in a row in 1930 and all that. Sorry. But just look! What can you do? Ten players in the attacking third, your \u00a380m central defender at the far post waiting for a ball from a \u00a350m right-back who can\u2019t cross, your left-back on the right-hand corner of Istanbul Basaksehir\u2019s six-yard box, and your last man, who at the best of times moves around the pitch with the speed, power and athletic grace of Withnail, loitering 20 yards inside the opponents\u2019 half. Just look! Hats off to Ole, though, because nobody ever thought it possible to make Kevin Keegan look like the freak result of an overly ambitious genetic experiment utilising the genes of Karl Rappan, Helenio Herrera and Otto Rehhagel. But he\u2019s managed it. Nobody thought Demba Ba would ever score a funnier, more gut-clenching and trouser-bothering goal than the one involving $tevie Mbe, either, but here we are in the laundrette again. It\u2019s one hell of an achievement. \u201cIt is my responsibility,\u201d Ole says, perhaps unwisely drawing attention to himself during a week which has seen Mauricio Pochettino popping up on telly. Former captain Rio Ferdinand was also on the box, telling the tens who regularly tune in to BT Sport that such was the absurdity of the lapse, it should lead to fisticuffs in the dressing room, preferably instigated by the manager. We paraphrase, but only slightly, we\u2019re really not using much artistic licence here. Asked whether United\u2019s abysmal form might cost him the gig, Solskj\u00e6r declined to comment. \u201cYou have to stay strong. I\u2019m employed to do a job by the club and I do it to the best of my ability.\u201d Again, given the circumstances, not the smartest choice of words, and unless his team showcase a coherent strategy against Everton this Saturday, finally, at the 102nd time of asking, he could be out the door. Should the worst happen, he\u2019d become the first United manager to leave without any silverware whatsoever since the aforementioned O\u2019Farrell. The oft-referenced Bamlett didn\u2019t win anything either. Apologies yet again, but what can you do?

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWhen attempting to rationalise my actions, I believe it was the combination of the empty road, with no other vehicles to gauge my vehicles speed against, and the misapprehension that I was travelling kph rather than mph\u201d \u2013 Mesut \u00d6zil makes his excuses in a written apology to Bromley magistrates as to why he was caught doing 97mph on the M1 in July.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cMark Jones reports that Tony Cascarino doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a dinosaur or a \u2018Cascasaurus\u2019 (Fiver letters passim). Perhaps that\u2019s better than being regarded as cascarenite \u2013 a sedimentary rock with a high content of dinosaurian eggshell fragments (basically stuff that\u2019s fallen from a dinosaur\u2019s bum and been trampled underfoot. And, yes, I do know that it\u2019s technically a cloaca, not a \u2018bum\u2019)\u201d \u2013 Tony Thulborn. \u201cI\u2019d nominate Barry Ferguson, who after this piece of naughtiness would qualify as a Doyouthinkit-saurus\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon. \u201cIf you thought defending is going the same way as democracy and dignity (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), I think Manchester United\u2019s performance in Turkey might be the comet-hits-Earth moment that it went extinct altogether. If you\u2019re dinosaur themed week is to highlight one species above all others it is surely Defendrosaurus Maticodeinos (which translates roughly as a terribly slow-moving monster thrown into an altered landscape and totally unable to survive as a species)\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Paul Dixon. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Disabled people, the largest minority in Britain, have been missed from the the FA\u2019s Football Leadership Diversity Code targets. \u201cSadly it isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Disability Rights UK\u2019s Kamran Mallick. The Premier League\u2019s dismal pay-per-view model is likely to be ditched after this weekend\u2019s matches. Pay up for Brighton v Burnley while it\u2019s hot. Oh. Mason Greenwood hasn\u2019t made the cut for Gareth Southgate\u2019s latest England squad, but Phil Foden has. The full squad: Pickford (Everton), D Henderson (Manchester United), Pope (Burnley); Walker (Manchester City), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Chilwell (Chelsea), Coady (Wolves), Dier (Tottenham), Gomez (Liverpool), James (Chelsea), Keane (Everton), Maguire (Manchester United), Maitland-Niles (Arsenal), Mings (Aston Villa), Saka (Arsenal), Trippier (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid); J Henderson (Liverpool), Foden (Manchester City), Morris-Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers), Grealish (Aston Villa), Mount (Chelsea), Rice (West Ham), Ward-Prowse (Southampton), Winks (Tottenham); Kane (Tottenham), Abraham (Chelsea), Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Rashford (Manchester United), Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Sterling (Manchester City). Apparently, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho can\u2019t make his mind up. Championship leaders Reading were thrashed 3-0 at home and Watford came from behind to beat Stoke 3-2 \u2013 it\u2019s all in our Championship roundup. And we did one for Big Cup as well, with nine-man PSG imploding away at Leipzig. STILL WANT MORE? Barney Ronay on the juggernaut that is Bayern Munich. Settle in for a Big Website long read on why athletes choke. Daniel Gray celebrates the joy of an indirect free-kick inside the penalty box.
