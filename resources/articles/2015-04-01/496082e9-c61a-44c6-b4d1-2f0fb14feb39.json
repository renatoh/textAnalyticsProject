Company Shop, founded 40 years ago, was recognised for outstanding achievement in sustainable development. Working closely with major retailers and manufacturers, it sells on residual products such as those with damaged packaging or incorrect labelling to membership-only staff shops in factories. The business handles more than 30,000 tonnes of surplus stock a year and ensures that as much of it as possible reaches people\u2019s plates, rather than going to landfill or anaerobic digestion. A further project run by the company, the UK\u2019s first social supermarket called Community Shop was also recognised by the award. The pilot store near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, sells to people within the area who receive welfare support, helping to cut dependence on local food banks. Following the 2013 Goldthorpe store, the venture opened its first full-scale supermarket in Lambeth, south London in December last year. There are plans to open a further 20 across the country. The new project goes one step further, located in the community for the first time and matching surplus food with social need. Company Shop takes food from retailers, manufacturers and brands that is perfectly good to eat, but has been rejected because of packaging errors or because the contents are over- or underweight or are part of seasonal promotions that have ended. Mark Game, managing director of Company Shop, said: \u201cWe have always been motivated by doing business differently and we put social and environmental considerations at the heart of every decision we make. We hope this Award will raise further awareness of the solutions that are in place to avoid unnecessary waste and and drive behaviour change.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
