No amount of work in the nets or the gym can properly prepare you for having to drag your aches and pains out of bed after a full day in the field and get out there again at the start of play. It may become second nature midway through a county season, but after three months without having to do it there would have been a few complaining bodies (if not mouths) around the breakfast table in Port Elizabeth and it was no surprise when the performance turned out to be a bit out of kilter in that first hour or so. Stiffness wouldn't necessarily have been the reason that Andy Flintoff and Steve Harmison were bowling within themselves with the second new ball - on a slow wicket they may well have been concentrating on accuracy and using the odd quicker delivery as variation - but throughout the South Africa innings the consistency of last summer wasn't quite there in the bowling or fielding. Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles all bowled well, but the edge wasn't as sharp as it has been. The reason for that lies with England gambling on going into this series with only one three-day game behind them and short of what footballers would call match fitness. Cricketers need rest periods, of course they do, but being fresh mentally doesn't do anything to help the automatic parts of the game, such as footwork. You need time in the middle to find your rhythm, as a batsman, bowler and even as a fielder. Batsmen need to have runs behind them, bowlers have to be able to deliver a telling third spell as well, as the ones earlier in the day, and when you've been standing in the field for long periods, your routine needs to be automatic for every delivery; the movement and the belief that, 'It's coming to me, it's coming to me' has to be there. That crucial concentration can easily waver when you resume playing after a long break and if that happens catches will inevitably be dropped. Rhythm is the key element to Harmison's bowling. In the first innings of this Test he was bowling either a yard or so too short and too full, not yet finding that perfect length that has made him the number one bowler in the world rankings. The fact that he hasn't quite got the radar tuned in yet could be seen in the dismissal of Jacques Kallis. Harmison's attempted yorkers kept coming out as low full tosses and he bowled Kallis with one that swung in late and hit the off stump halfway up. A valuable wicket gratefully accepted, of course, but evidence that the range between his fuller-length deliveries and short balls was too great. Simon Jones also struggled to get it right, although to be fair the slow pitch didn't suit him or Harmison, and England were indebted to a good long spell from Giles that enabled Michael Vaughan to keep control of the game and not have to call on Jones for more than 14 overs on the first day. The course of the match could have gone very differently, though, if Graeme Smith or Kallis had got in and got after the slow bowler, and I also suspect Vaughan was happy enough to have lost the toss, with the pitch being at its best for batting on the second and third days. With Andrew Strauss and Marcus Trescothick making such a positive reply, England will feel their gamble is likely to pay off. But why gamble at all? I would have favoured playing two four-day games ahead of the first Test, rather than a single three-day match. A couple of longer games against provincial sides would have given England the chance to get their feet moving, shake off any rustiness and possibly build some momentum, although it could be argued in the very unusual circumstances of having to play three Tests in as many weeks - a very hard thing to do mentally - it would have been too much to ask the same 11 or 12 players to play consecutive warm-up games as well. Instead, the thinking seems to have been, let's rely on our confidence and good form from the summer to get us through the first Test and take it on from there. It may well work here, against a South Africa side that clearly isn't as strong as it was a few years ago, but what worries me is that this may set a precedent for future tours and that ultimately in two years' time we'll try to begin an Ashes series in Australia even less prepared than we were last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
