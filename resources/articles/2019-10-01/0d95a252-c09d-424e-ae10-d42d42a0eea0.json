The centre-back, who has been at Spurs since 2012, is out of contract at the end of the season and is considering his options. Inter were keen to sign him last summer but could not afford him then and, having been told that a transfer in January is out of the question, will try to convince the Belgian to join in time for the 2020-21 season. Spurs have not given up on agreeing a new contract with Vertonghen but Inter are preparing a three-year deal for the 32-year-old and the Premier League club are unlikely to offer the defender such a long deal. Inter are looking at different options at centre-back with the manager, Antonio Conte, keen to improve the defence. The club lie second in Serie A after nine games, a point behind leaders Juventus. Vertonghen is not the only Tottenham player whose contract is running out in the summer with Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen in a similar situation. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side have endured a difficult start to the season and are 11th in the Premier League after Sunday\u2019s 2-1 defeat against Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
