The rioting and its consequences were indeed ugly, and the emotions behind this latest football fan outrage were savage in the extreme. But I can't help but think the extraordinary level of attention paid the event speaks to a broader phenomenon. Our strongest cultural passions these days seem to be reserved for sporting events, and, perhaps, reality TV. The rest of the cultural world no longer possesses much emotional drama. Now don't get me wrong: I like football, and I'm more than happy to drink a few too many pints while watching a World Cup match or a European Cup final. But I can't really understand the passions behind a football riot. In fact it seems a rather stupid thing to rampage about. On the other hand, just once in my life, I'd love to sit in a classical concert and watch the audience get so excited they start ripping up their chairs and screaming in an intoxicated, ecstatic madness at ushers and conductors alike. (So long, of course, as there was no real physical violence.) An absurd dream? Perhaps. But such things used to actually happen. On the morning of May 30 1913, newspaper readers in Europe awoke to startling news. A major riot, involving many hundreds of people had erupted in the center of Paris. What was worse, the protagonists came not from [the] hoi polloi but from the upper echelons of high society. The trigger? The premier performance, by the Ballets Russes, of Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Presented with the unfamiliar, bravely modernist notes of Stravinsky's composition, large sections of the crowd at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es had begun booing, cat-calling, and, eventually, even ripping up their seats and hurling them in a fury toward the orchestra. Enraged, Stravinsky's fans had responded in kind. For the second half of the performance, Parisian police battled with rioting concert-goers as the orchestra gamely tried to play over the noise. By the time the dust settled, the theater was largely wrecked. Stravinsky, it was reported, had fled the auditorium in tears. The riot mimicked others that had occurred in prior decades: Audiences in Russia had reacted strongly to pieces they didn't like; major disturbances in Vienna had greeted works by Mahler and Berg; and art-goers in Paris had responded with a ferocious spasm of elite rage to the artist Eduard Manet's painting Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe at the annual Paris Salon. Elsewhere, angry audience members, backed up by financier JP Morgan, managed to convince the New York Metropolitan Opera to pull the plug on Strauss's licentious opera Salom\u00e9. These were shocking times. True, the disturbances were hardly on a par with Milan's 1842 opera riots, when Italian nationalists used the occasion of the premier of Verdi's Nabucco to launch a string of attacks against their Austrian rulers. And they weren't even a pale imitation of Constantinople's infamous Nika riots in 532 A.D., during the reign of Emperor Justinian, in which rival political groupings gathered around competing charioteers rampaged through the streets of the great imperial city, leaving tens of thousands of corpses in their wake. Truth be told, they probably couldn't even hold a candle to the bawdy, but generally non-deadly, 17th century London mobs who stood in theatre galleries throwing food and drink and everything else they could lay their hands on at the actors bringing Shakespeare's words to life before them. But at least there was a passion at work in the mad actions of the tuxedoed men and ballgowned women who so lost their heads when confronted with Igor Stravinsky's unfamiliar musical antics. To my knowledge, there hasn't been a significant classical music riot since 1973, when New Yorkers inside the beautiful Carnegie Hall booed so loudly at the US premier of Steve Reich's Four Organs that conductor Michael Tilson Thomas had to abandon the performance halfway through. Thirty four years is a long time... Surely those Barbican-goers could at least make paper airplanes of their programs and hurl them toward the orchestra next time they hear a piece of music played too loud, too fast, with not enough gusto, or, just with too many goddamn wind instruments. Now wouldn't that make a different kind of headline?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
