His warning came after he returned from a holiday at the Florida home of the pop star Robin Gibb to deadlock in the peace process and growing turmoil within republican ranks over whether Sinn F\u00e9in should make a historic compromise and lend its support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). One recently deselected Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member, Davy Hyland in Newry and Armagh, has already quit the party in protest. Another, Geraldine Dougan in Mid-Ulster, yesterday threatened to follow him. Any decision by Sinn F\u00e9in's imminent special conference to \"support policing and the judiciary while still under British control, in any shape or form\", Ms Dougan said, would render \"membership of that party ... untenable for me as an Irish republican\". Gerry Adams, Sinn F\u00e9in president, refused to be drawn into a detailed statement on the developing split within his party, but said senior officials would meet next week to re-examine their position. Signs of unrest within the party come as dissident republican groups have been organising meetings to coordinate opposition to the police and Mr Adams has been warned by police of death threats, reportedly from groups such as the Real and Continuity IRA. The leadership is coming up against greater internal opposition over policing than it experienced over the decision to destroy the IRA's arms. Failure to do the deal, however, will expose Sinn F\u00e9in to attack in the Irish general election this spring as a party opposed to law and order. The prime minister said clear commitments would have to be given in the coming weeks. The timetable agreed at the St Andrews summit last autumn envisages the transitional Stormont assembly being dissolved on January 30, fresh elections being held on March 7 and a devolved government taking office on March 26. In a statement from Downing Street yesterday, Mr Blair warned that devolution could only go ahead if there was clear agreement from Sinn F\u00e9in that it would support the police and from Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party that it would deliver on power-sharing. \"It is only on this basis and with this clarity that we can proceed to an election,\" he said. \"I am confident that both parties want to see progress and will honour their commitments. But there is no point in proceeding unless there is such clarity.\" The extent of the latest crisis emerged on Wednesday evening when Sinn F\u00e9in hinted that because of what it deemed to be an inadequate response from the DUP it might postpone a special party conference expected to give backing to the PSNI later this month. In an unusually detailed explanation of where negotiations now stood, Mr Blair's statement added: \"On policing, justice and the rule of law, Sinn F\u00e9in will propose to their party's ard fheis [conference] that Sinn F\u00e9in commit now and fully to support the PSNI and the criminal justice system and actively encourage everyone to cooperate fully with the police services in tackling crime in all areas as well as actively supporting all the criminal justice institutions. It is delivery on those commitments that creates the conditions for devolution of policing and justice to take place. When there is delivery, there will be devolution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
