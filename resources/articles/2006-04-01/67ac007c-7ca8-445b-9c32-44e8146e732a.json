Forget about strawberry lips or raspberry cheeks, now it's all about citrus fruits. Think of orange as the last frontier of the fruit bowl - it has finally been conquered, and all that remains is for you to stake your claim. We've done lemon (yellow eyes), now it's time for orange lips. Orange lips are not as mad as they sound - orange is, after all, a warm colour, and it's a tone that beefs up just a hint of a tan. It is also surprisingly flattering. But, as with all of this season's acid brights, the orange must not be dull or matt, and we want orange-orange, not any of that wishy-washy coral business. First, apply a primer to your lips, then line them in a nude shade. Brush on orange lipstick in thin layers, then go over the top with an orange gloss. Keep the rest of the face colour-free and finish off with a slick of mascara, preferably a clear one. Or, to put it another way, orange is the only fruit (sorry). \u00b7 Pop gloss, \u00a314, by Givenchy, 01932 233909. Lip glaze in Tangerine Tea, \u00a311.50, by Aveda, 0870 034 2380.
