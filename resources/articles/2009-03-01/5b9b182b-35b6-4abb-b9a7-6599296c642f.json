It will be the first time in peacetime the century-old event has not taken place. The biennial event, which was due to be staged in London next summer, has been running since 1903 and has taken place ever since, apart from during the two world wars. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the trade body which organises the two-week show in July, said it had consulted with its members before making the decision. It said it would be inappropriate to expect struggling carmakers to commit themselves to taking part. Some companies employ more than 200 people during the event, incurring considerable hotel bills and other expenses. The total cost of participating in international motor shows can often run into tens of millions of pounds. Planning for them typically starts a year before the event. This is why the Detroit and Geneva motor shows recently took place despite the dire state of the industry, as most companies had already committed to taking part. But other motor shows scheduled to take place over the next 18 months could be scrapped. A spokesman for Oica, the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, which helps organise the calendar of events for the industry, admitted that a number of smaller shows might not take place next year. But he said the \"Big Five\" \u2013 the showcases in Geneva, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Detroit \u2013 would all go ahead. Paul Everitt, chief executive of the SMMT, said: \"It's obvious that companies' budgets are under pressure and it would be tough for them to make a commitment. We are working in an industry where people have been made redundant and are facing an uncertain future. \"It would be inappropriate to then say 'We are going to be holding a multimillion-pound event next year' when we don't know what the economic circumstances will look like.\" Carmakers have been savaged by a dramatic slump in sales. Swaths of the industry, especially dealerships and suppliers, have also been starved of credit. The British car industry is in limbo as companies wait to find out who will be eligible for the \u00a32.3bn package of loans and loan guarantees from the government. Companies have to submit projects to develop fuel-efficient technologies to qualify for the financial support, and it will take weeks for them to put together their applications and get a decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
