At the end of last season he hit a 102-ball 90 at Edgbaston to secure the Norwich Union League title and yesterday he hit a wonderful century, his first for Kent at senior level, to take the side into the C&amp;G quarter-finals, where they will play Gloucestershire. Hockley, 23, has just scored two hundreds for the second team and is now putting the less than prolific Ed Smith and Matthew Walker under pressure in the first-class side. Yesterday he scored 121 from 107 balls, with 14 fours and three sixes. But he did not slog. He played what Ron Atkinson might describe as \"Hollywood shots\", the sort of dream strokes one might play with a stick in front of the hall mirror when no one is watching. A pulled six off Dougie Brown and a straight-driven six off Neil Carter were particularly memorable. He dominated a second-wicket stand of 157 in 26 overs with Robert Key (64), who is tipped as an England player of the near future. In reply Warwickshire, who had won their previous nine one-day games, were bowled out for 200 in 37.1 overs. Only when Ian Bell and Jim Troughton were in chirpy alliance, sharing a stand of 75 for the fourth wicket, did Warwickshire look remotely capable of sustaining their chase. Once Troughton was well caught by Paul Nixon, standing up to Mark Ealham, the game was up for Warwickshire. Andrew Symonds yorked Bell with his first ball soon afterwards and took three for six in a dozen balls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
