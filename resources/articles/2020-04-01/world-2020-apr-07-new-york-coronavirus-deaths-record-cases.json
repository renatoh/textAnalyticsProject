The governor noted the three-day average of hospitalizations was down, indicating the state is \u201creaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations\u201d. But the New York death toll continues to steeply rise. The state has recorded 5,489 deaths, up from 4,758 a day earlier. Those 731 deaths on Monday represent the highest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis started. At least 3,544 people have died in New York City from Covid-19 as of Tuesday afternoon, the city reported, a figure that eclipsed those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attack, which claimed the lives of 2,753 people in the city. New York has the highest number of cases of any US state, with 138,863 cases of coronavirus already confirmed. New York City has seen the largest number of cases and deaths within the state, with 74,601 cases. Cuomo said officials would look ahead to restarting the economy but noted that the state was not there yet because coronavirus deaths were still happening at a high rate. He added that the determination of when and how to restart the economy would depend on testing, particularly testing to confirm if people have coronavirus antibodies in their system and are likely to be immune to the virus. The governor said New York would need to scale up its testing capacity to test a large number of residents and announced the state would invest in testing companies working to expand capacity. He said he understood the frustration of residents who are asking when social distancing might come to an end. \u201cThis is like Groundhog Day, living through this bizarre reality that we\u2019re in,\u201d Cuomo said. But the governor emphasized residents would need to continue to be patient in order to protect their loved ones and neighbors from contracting the virus. \u201cI get it, but it\u2019s only been 37 days,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cOur behavior affects the number of cases.\u201d New York residents have been ordered to avoid holding large funerals. \u201cThese social distancing regulations are not just \u2018please\u2019. They\u2019re regulations,\u201d said Cuomo, who doubled the fine for violating the \u201cstay at home\u201d order yesterday. \u201cNow is not the time for large religious gatherings,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou do no one a service by making this worse and infecting more people.\u201d Cuomo also noted the 1918 flu epidemic peaked in New York for six months, killing 30,000 of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cSocial distancing is working,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI know that it\u2019s hard, but we have to keep doing it.\u201d On Monday, a New York City official warned it could establish temporary burial grounds in city parks. On Tuesday, Cuomo urged New Yorkers to remember that each coronavirus death represented a human being who had a family. \u201cI guess one could get numb to the numbers,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cFor myself, I can tell you, the last thing I do is get numb.\u201d The governor noted mourning in the state was intensifying as the death toll rises. \u201cThe pain is increasing. The grief is increasing,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow you could get numb to any of this, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t see the numbness, and I don\u2019t think New Yorkers see the numbness.\u201d Cuomo said that he was proud of the work the state\u2019s healthcare system had done to save every person it could from dying of coronavirus. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis virus is very good at what it does, and it kills vulnerable people ... We can\u2019t stop that. The question is, are you saving everyone you can save?\u201d He applauded the work of medical professionals, saying: \u201cWhat they have done is incredible.\u201d He also thanked other essential workers, such as transit employees. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re exposing themselves to, and they still do it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cGod bless them.\u201d The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose workers operate buses and subway trains in New York City, has already lost 33 members to coronavirus.
