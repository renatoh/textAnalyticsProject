In this wonderfully exuberant new musical play at the Lyttelton, he celebrates Sodom like there's no Gomorrah. But the satirist in him also attacks the commodification of sex and the resultant loss of love. The result is an evening rich in rudery and ambivalence. The first, undeniably more brilliant half is set in London in 1726 - a period when sex and capitalism went hand in hand. We watch intrigued as Mrs Tull inherits her husband's dress-hire shop for whores. Discovering her apprentice, Martin, and some of his chums in skirts, she becomes aware of a bustling subculture that will enable her to fulfil two of her fantasies: to become a surrogate mother and to earn a pretty penny. From there it is but a short step to setting up a molly house, or male brothel. The wit of the first half lies in the way Ravenhill gradually draws us into this world of secret sodomy and entrepreneurial initiative. The scene where Martin and his friend Thomas don dresses and act out sexual games is both touching and funny: clothes not only make the man but release the hidden woman. But Ravenhill also cunningly makes us admire the blossoming of Mrs Tull while questioning the amorality of capitalism as she dubiously announces, \"That's the beauty of business: it judges no one.\" After all this parodic verve and sexual subversiveness, Ravenhill becomes more explicitly moralistic in the second half. The scene shifts to modern London, where two Bloomsbury men are staging a gay orgy. Although the scene is penetrated by echoes of the 18th century, Ravenhill makes his points a little too obviously: that innocent games have turned into fetishistic rites and that a onetime celebration of otherness has now led to a world of pink pounds and commercialised sex in which love is a precarious survivor. In the process some of the ribald ecstasy goes out of the play. But this is still an astonishing work to find at the National Theatre - or anywhere else for that matter - and it shows Ravenhill working on a much broader canvas than in his previous plays. Nicholas Hytner's inventive production also boasts a fine set by Giles Cadle, lively music by Matthew Scott and a host of good performances. Deborah Findlay's Mrs Tull is a delicious Hogarthian mix of native shrewdness and maternal longing, and there is fine support from Paul Ready and Dominic Cooper as the apprentice lovers, Ian Redford as a burly transvestite and Danielle Tilley as a rustic whore. Delicate souls may be offended, but there is no doubting the sincerity of Ravenhill's assault on the transformation of sex into a dirty business. \u0095 Until November 24.
