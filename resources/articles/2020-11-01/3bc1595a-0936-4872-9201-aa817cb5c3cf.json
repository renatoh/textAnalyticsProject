Having spent a week in isolation after a member of the bloc\u2019s team tested positive for coronavirus, Barnier and his staff resumed face-to-face negotiations in London on Saturday morning. Barnier told MEPs in a private meeting on Friday that he would work through the weekend and then \u201cmaybe one or two more days\u201d in a last-ditch attempt to bridge the large gaps between the sides. EU sources said there was a growing feeling that the lack of progress and the need to prepare businesses for the repercussions of a no-deal British departure from the EU made it unwise for negotiations to continue beyond then. With just 34 days before the end of the transition period, Barnier has been advised by officials in the European parliament that arranging for sufficient scrutiny and a consent vote by MEPs before the end of the year would be difficult without a deal by Wednesday. Priti Patel, the UK home secretary, said on Saturday: \u201cAs a government, we\u2019re very clear in our commitment to make sure that those talks continue so that we can get to a conclusive end. \u201cBut at the same time we are preparing in the way in which our country would expect us to prepare for the end of transition \u2013 and from the Home Office and every aspect of government we are continuing while those negotiations carry on.\u201d An extraordinary sitting of the EU chamber has been pencilled in for 28 December, as first revealed by the Guardian. A final result would be announced at 6.30pm, central European time. There is some doubt over whether the EU would be willing to take the blame for a no-deal exit by walking away if this week fails to provide a breakthrough. There is the \u201cworst-case\u201d option of the deal being provisionally applied and a vote being held by the European parliament after the end of the year, if further time appears useful, but that is not currently being considered. The European parliament has insisted, with Barnier\u2019s backing, that it will have the \u201clast word\u201d on the trade and security treaty. The negotiations remain stuck on the level of access that will be granted to European fishing fleets in UK waters, and the means by which either side will be able to hit back if the other seeks to gain a competitive advantage by diverging on environmental, labour or social standards. Barnier expressed his dismay to EU ambassadors on Friday that the UK was still claiming that the EU-Canada trade deal offered precedent for its negotiating demands. He described progress on \u201clevel playing field\u201d provisions as \u201cephemeral\u201d, with one week\u2019s progress constantly at risk of being undone by the next. In the political declaration on the future relationship, both sides committed to \u201cuphold the common high standards\u201d in the UK and the EU \u201cat the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, the climate crisis and relevant tax matters\u201d. The UK has agreed to non-regression on standards but it does not want EU law to be the baseline. That would introduce EU concepts and the European court of justice into the treaty. The two sides are therefore locked in talks about how to define their current common high standards. The EU is also seeking a \u201cratchet clause\u201d to ensure that as either side develops its standards over time, the other side faces consequences should it choose not to follow with equivalent regulations. The negotiators are working on a model where if one side raises standards, the other must consider adopting them. The EU then wants an independent panel to judge if one side\u2019s refusal to move in tandem is creating a competitive advantage. They would then set a remedy. But the UK is resisting anything that amounts to Brussels having the right of prior approval on domestic legislation. The scale of the difference between the two sides on fisheries was laid bare after Barnier told MEPs on Friday that the UK was seeking to repatriate 80% of the EU\u2019s current catch in British seas, described as an \u201coutsized\u201d volume. The EU has so far only offered to return between 15% to 18%, an offer described by British negotiators as \u201cderisory\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
