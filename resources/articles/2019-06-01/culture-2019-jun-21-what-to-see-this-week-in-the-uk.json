Bonnie makes her own toy, Forky, whose identity crisis tests Woody and co\u2019s commitment to their deeply held ideals. Plus there is Keanu Reeves as a funny stunt toy \u2026 Diego Maradona (12A) (Asif Kapadia, 2019, UK) 130 mins The Senna and Amy director has forged an epic film, whose subject is almost too big for the space allotted. Kapadia focuses on Maradona\u2019s spell in Naples, where he rejuvenated the team and got entangled with the mafia. Brightburn (15) (David Yarovesky, 2019, US) 90 mins After being (briefly) ejected from the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, James Gunn went off and produced this enterprising superhero slasher movie, a kind of anti-Superman. A meteor crash lands on Earth, a baby boy inside; but when adolescence arrives for the adoptee, now called Brandon, the new powers that come with it are nightmarishly homicidal. Elizabeth Banks plays the smalltown mother at bay. Late Night (15) (Nisha Ganatra, 2019, US) 102 mins Mindy Kaling has sharply improved her profile with this successful comedy, which combines a fascination for inside stories of the TV industry with pointed comment on the way the politics of diversity is handled in the workplace. Late Night also provides an excellent role for Emma Thompson as the talkshow host who hires Kaling\u2019s writer in an attempt to make her show relevant again. The Edge of Democracy (No cert) (Petra Costa, 2019, Brazil) 113 mins This could not be more topical: a film about Brazil\u2019s tempestuous recent political past, from Lula to the impeachment of his successor Dilma Rousseff. This all laid the groundwork for current president, the populist Jair Bolsonaro. It\u2019s a portrait of a bitterly divided nation, which has lessons for all of us. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Glastonbury After taking 2018 off, the UK\u2019s top mudbath is back with a typically eclectic lineup. Stormzy (pictured) as headliner on Friday should be a proper moment, while the other stages offer the likes of Kamasi Washington, Rosal\u00eda, Tame Impala, Dave and Billie Eilish. There are legends, too: Kylie plays on Sunday 30 Jun and the actual Janet Jackson performs before Liam Gallagher on Saturday 29 June. Worthy Farm, nr Shepton Mallet Wednesday 26 to 30 June Quincy Jones Originally billed as a celebration of Jones\u2019s work on Michael Jackson\u2019s iconic Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad albums, the newly christened Quincy Jones: Presents Soundtrack of the 80s will also now include a smattering of his other productions for the likes of Michael McDonald. Guest singers on the night include Beverley Knight, Daley and, erm, James Morrison. The O2, SE10, Sunday 23 June King Princess New York-born, LA-based Mikaela Straus \u2013 AKA newcomer King Princess \u2013 has fast become a queer icon, peppering her lo-fi pop with readymade Pride slogans such as \u201cmy pussy is God\u201d, from last year\u2019s Pussy Is God, and latest single Cheap Queen\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a real queen / I can make grown men cry\u201d. It\u2019s also worth following her on Instagram for some properly amusing #content. The Academy, Dublin, Monday 24 June; O2 Forum Kentish Town, NW5, Wednesday 26 June Alphabeat After a seven-year hiatus, Danish sextet Alphabeat \u2013 come on: you remember 2008\u2019s wonky pop classic Fascination and, possibly, 2009\u2019s 80s throwback The Spell \u2013 returned earlier this year with the typically breezy Shadows and the promise of a new album. To celebrate they are playing this one-off London show at central London\u2019s sadly soon-to-close Borderline club. The Borderline, W1, Friday 28 June MC Archie Shepp Archie Shepp was an avant garde, John Coltrane-partnering saxophone firebrand in the 1960s. Nowadays, he is a soulful \u2013 but still sharply political \u2013 octogenarian player-singer who knows jazz and African-American history like the back of his hand. He is joined here by young Parisian pianist Carl-Henri Morisset and others, on classic ballads, blues and rugged swing. Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 24 &amp; Tuesday 25 June JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Brundib\u00e1r Composed in Prague in 1938, and rehearsed in a Jewish orphanage there three years later, Hans Kr\u00e1sa\u2019s children\u2019s opera was subsequently performed in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943 and 1944, where the composer was also interned. Among the cast for the original performances of Brundib\u00e1r (Bumblebee) was the mother of Welsh National Opera\u2019s music director Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus (pictured), and Hanus now conducts these performances with WNO Youth Opera, as part of the WNO\u2019s Freedom season; David Pountney directs. Wales Millennium Centre: Weston Studio, Cardiff, Saturday 22 &amp; Sunday 23 June Emanuel Ax at 70 Although he has been in the front rank of contemporary pianists for a quarter of a century now, Emanuel Ax\u2019s appearances in Britain often seem sporadic. But the Wigmore Hall is celebrating Ax\u2019s 70th birthday with a generous three-part, all-Schumann programme, in which Ax will play the Arabeske and the Op 12 Fantasiest\u00fccke, accompany baritone Simon Keenlyside in Dichterliebe, and join the Dover Quartet in the Piano Quartet and Piano Quintet. Wigmore Hall, W1, Tuesday 25 June The Cunning Little Vixen Simon Rattle\u2019s collaborations with director Peter Sellars are already a regular part of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s season. Now they turn their attention to Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s most joyous, life-affirming opera. This semi-staging of The Cunning Little Vixen, sung in Czech, features Lucy Crowe as the Vixen and Gerald Finley as the Forester, with a supporting cast that includes Sophia Burgos, Peter Hoare and Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann. Barbican Hall, EC2, Thursday 27 &amp; 29 June AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Cindy Sherman Ever since portraying herself as a Hitchcock heroine and horror film innocent in the early black-and-white Untitled Film Stills, this essential artist of our age has been using photography and disguise to play with her own image and identity. For Cindy Sherman we are all actors in the film of our life, which gets edgier with time. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thursday 27 June to 15 September Get Up, Stand Up Now This epic survey of black creativity since Windrush features 50 years of art that stands up for its rights. Artists of the quality of Anthea Hamilton, Ajamu, Betye Saar, Chris Ofili and Yinka Shonibare CBE (Self Portrait after Warhol, pictured) show alongside Zadie Smith and A Guy Called Gerald in a multidisciplinary festival of resistance. Somerset House, WC2, to 15 September Jeff Wall Wall is an artist of unfinished stories. His photographs carefully, and often beautifully, shape dramas whose beginnings and ends we don\u2019t know. Instead, we see moments full of apparently important symbolism. Recovery, a portrait of a young man who seems to have just gotten over some crisis, and The Gardens, a cinematic narrative in three scenes, continue his fascination with the ways an image can be meaningful. White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, SW1, Friday 28 June to 7 September As Seen on Screen Since the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, art has tried to keep up with cinema. Cubism and futurism can be seen as attempts to capture the movement of film in restless images. This exhibition brings the story up to date, from Fiona Banner\u2019s project to write down everything in Lawrence of Arabia to work by Sam Taylor-Johnson, whose career trajectory from video art to Hollywood is a screen legend in itself. Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, to 18 August Leonardo da Vinci The books of Leonardo da Vinci are among the most beguiling things ever created by humanity. They range from small pocket notebooks to vast albums of drawings. Any sheet might include sublime sketches, intricate writings, a recipe or shopping list: life, art and wonder all mixed up. This exhibition includes a notebook lent by the V&amp;A and selections from the Codex Leicester, owned by Bill Gates. The British Library, NW1, to 8 September JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Europe In his first gig as artistic director of the Donmar, Michael Longhurst revives David Greig\u2019s 1994 play, a breakthrough for the much-lauded Scottish playwright. Europe is set in a small, largely forgotten border town where trains no longer stop. Two refugees turn up and drama \u2013 topical drama indeed \u2013 ensues. The cast includes Natalia Tena, Billy Howle and Faye Marsay. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 10 August The Color Purple This hit Broadway musical is based on Alice Walker\u2019s novel and Steven Spielberg\u2019s film. It follows the harrowing, inspiring life of Celie (T\u2019Shan Williams, pictured) growing up in a racially divided US south, and features a score infused with jazz, ragtime, gospel and blues. Curve Theatre, Leicester, Friday 28 June to 13 July; Birmingham Hippodrome, 16 to 20 July The Deep Blue Sea Thank gawd Terence Rattigan is back in fashion: The Deep Blue Sea is a real theatrical treat. Set in 1950s London, the play follows one day in the dramatic life of Hester Collyer, a woman who has abandoned her respectable husband in favour of a deliciously destructive romance. But what happens when the passion fades and reality sets in? The lead role is taken by Nancy Carroll (pictured), an actor with extraordinary emotional clarity and sway. Chichester Festival Theatre, to 27 July Aesop\u2019s Fables Justin Audibert and Rachel Bagshaw co-direct this two-tiered take on Aesop\u2019s fables: one lot for ages four to seven, and one for ages eight to 12. A selection of these Greek fables have been reimagined by an exciting group of spirited and provocative playwrights. Adaptations by Chris Thorpe, EV Crowe and Chris Goode might well be the best of the bunch. Unicorn Theatre, SE1, to 4 August Bare: A Pop Opera This coming-of-age rock musical has a touch of Glee about it \u2013 only with much more edge. Featuring music by Damon Intrabartolo and lyrics and book by Jon Hartmere, the show follows the students of a strict Catholic boarding school as they explore sex, drugs and queer identity. Packed with eccentric characters and lit up with great heart and wit, this could prove a real hit for this popular theatre nestled beneath Waterloo station. The Vaults, SE1, to 4 August MG Three of the best ... dance shows Boris Charmatz: 10000 Gestures French choreographer and provocateur Boris Charmatz unleashes a thrilling torrent of movement \u2013 those 10,000 gestures of the title \u2013 as his dancers hop, spin, flail and scratch their bums in a compendium of movement that adds up to something much more. Charmatz will also mastermind free public events over the weekend. Tate Modern, SE1, Saturday 22 &amp; Sunday 23 June Dance@TheGrange Fancy a fine evening out on a Hampshire country estate? Wayne McGregor curates a programme featuring his own company alongside Alessandra Ferri and Ballet Black, plus a chance to see the work of upcoming Australian choreographer Alice Topp. The Grange at Northington, Alresford, Tuesday 25 &amp; Wednesday 26 June Edifice Dance Theatre: Salom\u00e9 Edifice harnesses an unusual combination of ballroom, Latin and contemporary dance to tell a lusty version of Oscar Wilde\u2019s Salom\u00e9. Choreographers Carmine De Amicis and Harriet Maghorn star.
