The 28-year-old remains at the top of Rafael Ben\u00edtez's list of targets and, although he will wait until the end of the season before giving further thought to his future, he is adamant there will be no repeat of the bitter dispute he became embroiled in last year. Martin O'Neill and Ben\u00edtez clashed when Liverpool made their interest in Barry public around 12 months ago and the England international was later banned from Villa's training ground and stripped of the captaincy after he criticised the Northern Irishman in an interview. When Liverpool subsequently failed to meet Villa's \u00a318m valuation, it left Barry in an uncomfortable position. \"I've learnt a lot from what happened and last season I learned a lot off the pitch,\" said Barry, who has 12 months remaining on his Villa contract. \"I'm looking for a completely opposite scale of things and I'm confident it won't be one of those sagas again. There are things I'll do differently. I'm not dreading it at all. I know what's coming. From the experience of last year I'm hoping to deal with it better.\" Although O'Neill and Barry have since repaired their relationship, it remains highly likely that Villa's longest-serving player \u2013 he has spent more than a decade at the club \u2013 will move on this summer. He is desperate to play Champions League football and O'Neill recently indicated he would not \"begrudge\" Barry that opportunity if Villa failed to finish in the top four this season. Barry maintains, however, that the subject will be far from his thoughts until the end of next month. \"It would be disrespectful to the fans and the club if I'm thinking about anything else rather than trying to get maximum points from the last four games \u2013 that's where my head is at this moment. It will definitely be a difficult decision but we'll see where we are at the end of the season.\" Ben\u00edtez had hoped to sell Xabi Alonso to Juventus to fund his move for Barry only for the Italian club to fail to meet Liverpool's asking price. Ernesto Bronzetti, an Italian agent who advises Juventus on transfers, however, has claimed there could be a renewed approach for the Spaniard this summer. \"For the Juventus central midfield, I would try to bring in Alonso,\" he said. \"There was a long chase last summer for his signature, of course, so it is a road we know. Pairing him with [Mohamed] Sissoko would be a title-winning midfield. The problem is that it would be very hard and expensive to take such an important player away from Liverpool. Ben\u00edtez considers him fundamental to the way they play.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
