We were dreamers: we thought that what we did for our country was for the people of Chile. We were so na\u00efve - we weren't even armed. We were caught completely by surprise. I did think that a coup could happen, but I did not really believe it would. We had people in the military like Carlos Prats [Pinochet's predecessor as army chief] who stood for democracy. Also, our army was different from the ones in the rest of Latin America. It did not have a history of meddling in politics. At the same time, I knew that what we did was revolutionary, and that the United States was plotting against our president from the beginning. During the Allende government, I was a journalist. I was a member of the national council of the Socialist party. I was working for a unit of Chile Films that toured the shantytowns and the countryside educating people about health and education. I was also a father of two. On the Saturday before the coup, I took my wife and children to my hometown of San Antonio [a coastal town about 100km from Santiago]. I had a premonition that something would happen. The coup happened on a Tuesday. At 5am, I was woken up by a friend, who said: \"The military are coming.\" I jumped out of bed and ran out. I saw the military going straight to my flat. It was a nightmare. I remember seeing people in the streets, some of them cut in two. The military was shooting everywhere and anyone. Friends would not open the door to me, saying: \"I am sorry, you cannot stay here.\" I saw in their faces that we had been defeated. On Saturday, I managed to go to San Antonio to get my wife and children and get back to Santiago. For the next six months, we went underground. We started reorganising the party, contacting the party members who who were courageous enough to work for us again. What else could we do? We had to resist. It was a very difficult time. We had no money. I did not know how I was going to eat the next day. What kept us going was the solidarity. A woman called Mar\u00eda, who worked at Chile Films, I don't know what happened to her since then, would give us food parcels from time to time. One day, the police came to my flat and arrested me. A party member had been detained and had given my name. They ransacked the flat and put a machine gun to my chest. My wife, Mercedes, told the policemen: \"I know that you will kill Carlos. Allow him to say goodbye to his children.\" I said goodbye and they took me away. I thought I would never see them again. They took me to a parking lot under La Moneda, the presidential palace, where the interrogation centre was. They immediately started to interrogate me. The first night was horrible. I think I lost consciousness several times. I was determined not to give names. I was convinced I was going to die. If it was going to happen, I was going to die with dignity, not as some traitor. Day after day, they interrogated me. Sometimes they would leave me for a day, sometimes for two. On some occasions, I was left in a terrible condition, with very bad bruises. But I managed not to say a name. After three months, I was moved to another place, which used to be one of the headquarters for the socialist party. Now it was nicknamed the House of Terror. The man in charge, Romo, was someone I knew before the coup. He was a socialist. Now he was one of my torturers. I don't know if he ever recognised me because I had cut my beard, I was wearing a hood and tape over my eyes, and my fake name meant nothing to him. At another prison, I managed to get a message in the laundry of a fellow cellmate. My wife informed the Red Cross, which meant that the government had to recognise that they had detained me for six months. It saved my life. After being moved through different prisons and concentration camps, I was expelled to Panama by a decree signed by Pinochet. When I got there, I did not have a penny in my pocket. I was sharing a room with three other exiles. The archbishop of Panama offered me work for a magazine and teaching journalism. My salary was $125 a month, while my rent was $150 a month. It was a very difficult time. I was elected president of [human rights group] Chile Democratico and resumed campaigning for democracy. Four years later, in November 1979, I was kidnapped by Chilean police and taken to a military camp near the airport. A US citizen and Chilean policemen interrogated me, before putting me back on a plane back to Chile. But because of my high profile, there was a big campaign to release me. A Panamanian journalist spotted me at the airport and alerted the archbishop, who then alerted the Jesuits in Chile. When I arrived at Santiago airport, the Jesuits fought the police. The authorities realised they could not disappear me again. After a day in Santiago, they sent me back to Panama. In Panama, as I was walking out of the plane, the Panamanian police said they needed to talk to me in private. They took me to a room, beat me up, and put me in a plane to Santiago, via London. On the way to Heathrow, my two guards got drunk. They were sound asleep when we got there. When the door of the plane opened, I ran to immigration and claimed political asylum. My two guards arrived and told the British I was a delinquent. British immigration decided to interview me. I told them everything and they said: \"We don't believe you. We're going to send you back to Chile.\" I knew that if they did, I was going to die. I managed to make a phone call to Amnesty International. Lord Avebury came, and then put an urgent motion in parliament to stop my deportation. This is why I now live here. Britain saved my life. Today, my work as a photographer is about documenting the suffering of people who have no opportunity to express themselves. I am more happy than I ever could imagine. Despite what happened to me, I am not bitter. I have become a citizen of the world. I am not a hero, I am just someone who survived. \u00b7 Interview by Gwladys Fouch\u00e9"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
