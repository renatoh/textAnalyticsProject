The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party in the 2017 election. Two years later, we\u2019re keen to hear from voters in the city about their views on the election. We\u2019re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017. Are the young people in Canterbury who swung the election last time still motivated or are they split? With the decline of Facebook, how are volunteers and organisers from the main parties getting their message across online? We\u2019d also like to know how you\u2019re following this election, whether through traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media.
