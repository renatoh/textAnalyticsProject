Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. As we continue to play chicken with hope, last week\u2019s optimism is followed by the chilly aftermath of insurgency. Who will impose order on this chaos? The Colonies A terrified Emily and Janine are rounded up with cattle prods and bundled into cars, bound for their old neighbourhood, where there\u2019s now a handmaid shortage. Canada This week, we see a direct link between Luke and June as he waits with Moira for news of the bombing victims. They need to know if she survived the attack. Later, as the names are read out, we discover that Lillie Fuller is Ofglen, the one responsible for the suicide attack. Meanwhile, Moira begs the official to help her find her fiancee in the missing person files. She\u2019s shown into a room with records of the unidentified people and the missing children and we discover, in flashback, more of Moira\u2019s backstory. As she remembers her flirty meeting with Odette, she turns the page and sees her true love\u2019s body lying on the ground, mouth ajar, eyes staring. The tears come to Moira\u2019s cheeks as her teeth chatter with shock. The before time It\u2019s Moira\u2019s turn to reminisce about her former freedoms as we see her planning and going through with a surrogacy for a British couple. She has the usual pregnancy experiences; ante-natal classes and scans, but at a distance from it all. As Moira holds her son for the last time and hands him over to his new family, she doesn\u2019t take her eyes off the baby boy. Her flirtation with Odette is touching and heartbreaking as Moira\u2019s research reveals her murder in one of the Gilead purges. Gilead The funeral procession of the handmaids leads us through the snow to the red coffins of dozens of handmaids, laid out in flower formation. As their sisters mourn them with their red veils, Lydia tearfully recites Bible passages to which the women respond robotically. \u201cI heard 26 commanders, 31 of us,\u201d says one in the back of the van home. Bodies hang outside some of the snow-clad houses they pass on their journey through the district, a visible show of wrath designed to terrify. In hospital, Serena sits by Fred\u2019s bed, clutching his hand. At home, Offred is visited by new head honcho, Commander Cushing, still scarred from the explosion. He menaces and quizzes her about her connection to Ofglen, finally demanding to know who helped Offred escape. No one is talking about \u201ckidnap\u201d any more. As June and Nick kiss in the hospital corridor, I can\u2019t help thinking they would never be this reckless. On a normal day in Gilead, they\u2019d be mad to risk it but now, with security on red alert and everyone suspected, they\u2019re playing with fire. Serena and Offred\u2019s late-night kitchen meeting is an interesting development (Offred\u2019s \u201cRight now, the baby needs Twinkies\u201d is an attempt at informality). Now Fred is out of the way, could the two forge an alliance? Serena says she knows Cushing and his wife from before and the two couples used to holiday together. \u201cNow, he\u2019s the big man,\u201d she says bitterly. She is visibly jangled when Offred starts to tell her what Cushing did to Ofglen\u2019s family: they have all been executed. Serena\u2019s zeal isn\u2019t completely unshakeable, then, as we see later in the episode when she stages a coup, bringing about the removal of Cushing. No one poses a threat to her household. The she-wolf rises and Cushing is swiftly arrested for treason. Almost as if the writer knows we need something to hang on to, the scene in the supermarket, with Emily and Janine returned from the Colonies, provides a brief shaft of sunlight in the darkness. The handmaids, again risking terrible retribution, quietly whisper their real names to each other as emotional strings swell on the soundtrack. I\u2019m happy for them, but I don\u2019t believe the world they have created would allow for such disobedience. It\u2019s too noticeable. In the study that night, Serena\u2019s \u201cRead over these for me\u201d is shocking. Women may not read or write, certainly not a handmaid, anyway. Offred can\u2019t believe what she is hearing, but quickly adjusts to the new situation. \u201cI\u2019ll need a pen,\u201d she says, daring Serena to keep going. The two smile at each other. Offred thumbs the end of the ballpoint pen, just as Ofglen did when she detonated the bomb. The sound of music The episode opens with Iris DeMent\u2019s My Life, a sad hymn to finding one\u2019s purpose, or some meaning, in life. We close with the upbeat sound of Venus by Shocking Blue. Stop teasing us and start the revolution! Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Grim scale The regime\u2019s predictable reaction to the terror attack sees scores of lynchings as household staff hang from every tree and a Martha is shot dead in the street. This rates a chilling eight. Under His eye Nick hears that Commander Price has \u201cgone home to God\u201d. The chauffeur\u2019s chance at a transfer is gone and he must rethink his next move. I like how Eden\u2019s enthusiasm, despite her loveless marriage, is a source of major eye-roll to Offred. Canada showing no signs of intervening in the US. We now have to bet the farm on Gilead\u2019s women rising up and crushing their oppressors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
