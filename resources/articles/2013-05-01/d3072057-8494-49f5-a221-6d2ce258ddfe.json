The bus, designed to specifications laid down by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who mourned the retirement of the original Routemasters, is on a two-year world tour as part of a campaign to promote Britain. Downing Street was unamused by suggestions that the joint appearance by the prime minister and the prince in New York means that it takes one Etonian to fit two Etonians into a double-decker bus. The mayor, who was born in New York, was a few years ahead of the prime minister at the school, which Prince Harry and his older brother, the Duke of Cambridge, also attended. Prince Harry is in the middle of a highly successful tour of the US. He was cheered by fans \u2013 mainly young women \u2013 when he attended a reception last week in Congress to highlight the anti-landmine campaign championed by his late mother. While in Washington the prince laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and at the grave of a US soldier killed in Afghanistan at the Arlington national cemetery. He also stopped at the grave of President John F Kennedy who was assassinated 50 years ago this November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
