At Sixfields on Saturday the Cobblers beat Exeter City 3-0 in a scintillating match that would not have been out of place in any division. Both League Two clubs had won their opening game and beaten League One opposition midweek in the Capital One Cup. Northampton are now one of five sides with maximum points and have yet to concede a goal. Invited to enthuse afterwards, Chris Wilder, the manager, was all but tetchy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a 3-0 at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t fluctuate from an OK performance on Saturday to an outstanding one on Tuesday and then to a bang average one today. We scored three cracking goals but they\u2019ve not had the bounce of the ball, we made some great blocks and the goalkeeper [Adam Smith] was outstanding.\u201d Not content with that, after a game that had fizzed with crisp passing and nonstop, electric running, he added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t pass the ball well, we didn\u2019t make the right decisions and our energy levels weren\u2019t great.\u201d Wilder is nothing if not unpredictable. Having taken Oxford United from the Conference to sixth in League Two, he left them in bewildering fashion 18 months ago for Northampton, who were bottom. They survived by winning their last two matches, sending down Bristol Rovers, who bounced straight back only to be beaten by Northampton on the opening day. After hitting a side when it was up \u2013 that was the \u201cOK performance\u201d \u2013 they hit one that is down, Blackpool, 3-0 while Exeter were achieving the greater scalp of Swindon away. Exeter, enjoying the stability of Paul Tisdale\u2019s nine-year management, were no mean opponents. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were that far away,\u201d he said, but admitted Northampton were \u201cmore effective\u201d. If Wilder\u2019s reaction was not a case of mind games and management of expectations, it was madness that adds to the fans\u2019 prevailing mystification. In June the chairman, David Cardoza, revealed he had agreed to sell his controlling share in the club to an Indian consortium. Being London-based, they may not be chicken farmers but fans, as long as they remain in the dark, are wondering if the deal is cock-eyed. John Morris, chairman of the club\u2019s charitable foundation and former general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, was not alone in the programme in referring to the uncertainties hanging over the club and the need to sort them out quickly. Wilder, whose work he commended in spotting talent and developing it, not only has been given the time and money to assemble the squad he wants but is doing his best to make the club look a good buy, notwithstanding what Morris calls \u201cthe steel skeleton of an East Stand\u201d, a monument at present to over-ambition. The goals came from everywhere except the three of the 4-2-3-1 who buzzed as impressively as any, Lawson D\u2019Ath, Alfie Potter and Nicky Adams. In the second quarter Jason Taylor, of the defensive two, volleyed in from 20 yards, with Exeter surprised by a free\u2011kick taken short, and the centre-back Ryan Cresswell headed home a long one. Afterwards Taylor, man of the match, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to knuckle down and go again [at Barnet tomorrow].\u201d \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite at it for much of the time,\u201d added Cresswell. Heaven help opponents if they are. Both had had the Wilder debriefing. Marc Richards\u2019 late third goal rounded off a typically swift attack from Ricky Holmes\u2019 cross. In a nominal curiosity each side introduced a Holmes and Hoskins from the bench in the second half, when Exeter switched from 4-1-4-1 to 3-1-4-2 and put their tricky Holmes (Lee) up against Josh Lelan, the first man booked by Ross Joyce, handling his first League match since promotion this season. At 29, from Cleveland, he is the youngest of the 62 referees and looked an old hand. City were more dangerous for the substitution and Smith, lately acquired from Leicester, made an exceptional save from Will Hoskins in a busier second half. Fifty years ago Northampton were \u201cenjoying\u201d their only season in the top tier, in a decade which they started and finished where they are now. The manager, in his wilder dreams, may be reliving it. They already have a League Cup tie to look forward to at Newcastle next week. Sense may return only when the Cobblers are sold and healed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
