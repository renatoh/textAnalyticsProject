Linda Fairstein, who has faced intense backlash since the debut of When They See Us on 31 May , wrote in an op-ed published on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal that the dramatic series was \u201cso full of distortions and falsehoods as to be an outright fabrication\u201d. Fairstein called the series \u201cNetflix\u2019s false story\u201d and said the show \u201cdefames me\u201d. But critics have noted that some assertions in her op-ed do not match official records about the case. A Netflix spokeswoman said the company had no comment on Fairstein\u2019s remarks. The four-part series was written and directed by Ava DuVernay, the director of the movies A Wrinkle in Time and Selma, who responded to Fairstein\u2019s op-ed on Twitter, writing: \u201cExpected and typical. Onward.\u201d Fairstein, who is portrayed by the actor Felicity Huffman, said DuVernay had written \u201can utterly false narrative involving an evil mastermind (me) and the falsely accused (the five)\u201d. The five men \u2013 Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise \u2013 were 14 to 16 years old at the time of the 1989 rape and confessed after lengthy police interrogations. The victim was white and the defendants all black or Hispanic. Each soon recanted, insisting they had admitted to the crime under coercion from police officers. But they all were convicted and served prison terms of six to 13 years. A judge vacated their convictions in 2002 after another man confessed to the crime and DNA tests confirmed his guilt. Fairstein led the sex crimes unit of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office from 1976 until 2002 and then became a bestselling crime novelist. After criticism of her mounted on social media last week, Fairstein and her publisher Dutton said they had decided to \u201cterminate their relationship\u201d. Fairstein has also stepped down from boards of various not-for-profit groups, according to media reports. Asked about Fairstein at a Netflix event on Sunday, DuVernay said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that people be held accountable.\u201d But the director added: \u201cIt would be a tragedy if this story and the telling of it came down to one woman being punished for what she did, because it\u2019s not about her. She is part of a system that is not broken, it was built to be this way. It was built to oppress.\u201d Some parts of Fairstein\u2019s op-ed face scrutiny. She said one of the \u201cegregious falsehoods\u201d was the presentation of the interrogations in the series, which implied the teens were held without food and without their parents and in some cases barred from using the bathroom. \u201cIf that had been true, surely they would have brought those issues up and prevailed in pretrial hearings on the voluntariness of their statements, as well as in their lawsuit against the city,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, because it never happened.\u201d But as the Washington Post noted, it was not a new claim. In a 2016 essay, Salaam wrote: \u201cWhen we were arrested, the police deprived us of food, drink or sleep for more than 24 hours. Under duress, we falsely confessed.\u201d Records also show the defendants did raise these concerns in a pretrial hearing, contrary to Fairstein\u2019s claims, according to the New York Times. Fairstein\u2019s piece also references other crimes the Central Park Five allegedly committed in the park the night of the rape. But, as the Post noted, she ignored a later report from the district attorney\u2019s office that concluded: \u201cThere is a probability that the new evidence, had it been available to the juries, would have resulted in verdicts more favorable to the defendants, not only on the charges arising from the attack on the female jogger but on the other charges as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
