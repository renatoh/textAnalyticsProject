Many readers will disagree with the brevity of Philip's list, but there is no doubt that literary masterpieces frequently don't lend themselves easily to the big screen. What makes a novel great are often those qualities unique to the form: the ability to portray someone's interior life, to move fluidly between past, present and future, to render the ordinary magical through language. None of this can't be done on screen, but it is rarely achieved with the same subtlety. Perhaps this is why so few Booker Prize-winning novels have translated successfully to the screen. But now the ICA in London is giving book and film lovers the chance to debate the issue with its The Booker at the Movies season. Every Sunday in June it will screen the film of a Booker-winning or shortlisted novel, accompanied by a panel discussion from eminent screenwriters and novelists. Simon Gray, whose adaptation of JL Carr's A Month In The Country is one of the featured films, says he stayed extremely faithful to the original. 'The problems I had then came from the author, who said he had a serious objection to Moon turning out to be a homosexual, and would I please cut it. I said that it was in the novel. He said that, yes, it was, but he'd always regretted it, he'd stuck it in as an afterthought and now wanted it struck out. I refused, saying that the story depended on it, and he became rather hostile, but in the end he let us keep it.' The process of adaptation can be equally daunting for the author; the thin-skinned should be certain they are handing it over to someone in whom they have absolute faith. When director Fred Schepisi told Graham Swift he wanted to film his Booker-winning novel Last Orders, the author immediately turned down his offer to write the script himself. 'I'd never done it before and I didn't know if I would be any good, so I felt there was a case for a fresh creative approach.' Schepisi ended up writing the script himself, consulting Swift throughout. 'I was lucky - he was very respectful and it was a positive experience for me,' Swift recalls. 'I didn't want to be too authoritative because you have to allow the filmmaker freedom - no film is ever going to be the book, which is as it should be. To me the page will always be bigger than the screen, and no matter how good the result, the film will always seem smaller. But you have to be able to trust the talent and vision of the filmmaker.' You might think the process would be simpler when the author is prevented from interfering by virtue of being dead, but according to Deborah Moggach, who most recently adapted Pride and Prejudice and The Diary of Anne Frank for the screen and will also speak at the ICA, the pressures can be even worse. 'There's a huge weight of responsibility because people feel proprietorial towards these books and characters,' she says. 'Adaptation is a ruthless process - you have to dismember the book and reassemble it, so it must be approached with huge love and integrity. But when it's done well, it is an act of creativity between everyone involved.' When it works Great Expectations (1946) Adapted by Anthony Havelock-Allan, directed by David Lean. Lean comes close to finding a visual equivalent for Dickens's words. A Room With a View (1985) Adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, directed by James Ivory. Fine casting and cinematography. Sense and Sensibility (1995) Adapted by Emma Thompson, directed by Ang Lee. One of few Austen films that captures her wit. The English Patient (1997) Adapted and directed by Anthony Minghella. Minghella simplified the narrative of Michael Ondaatje's novel in this fine film. Brokeback Mountain (2005) Adapted by Larry McMurtry, directed by Ang Lee. Characters and plot were expanded from Annie Proulx's tale into an epic love story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
