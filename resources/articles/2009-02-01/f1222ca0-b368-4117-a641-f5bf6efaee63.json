They spent large portions of this filthy night in east Yorkshire defending their own line, with an injury-hit team that was reduced to 12 men for 10 minutes when the hooker Paul McShane was sent to the sin bin. But the Rhinos have not won consecutive Super League titles by accident, and with Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock setting inspiring leads, they overturned a 10-4 half-time deficit to maintain their 100 per cent record at the top of the table. Sinfield kicked a penalty to nudge them 12-10 ahead 12 minutes from the end, shortly after Hull KR had also been reduced to 12 when their wing Peter Fox was sin-binned for a professional foul. Then Ryan Bailey, a former Great Britain prop who has endured a difficult couple of years, capped an eye-catching individual performance with a barnstorming break to send the exciting young back Kallum Watkins over for the clinching score in the left corner, although even that came at a cost for the Rhinos as Bailey was felled by a late tackle by the Rovers full-back Shaun Briscoe and now seems highly unlikely to be available against Manly. Leeds had won their previous two games, against Celtic Crusaders and Wakefield, without approaching their attacking best, not surprisingly given a disrupted build-up to the season in which key players such as Brent Webb and Rob Burrow have been injured. They were both missing again last night, and were joined in the stand by Danny Buderus who apparently picked up an unspecified knock in his Leeds debut last week, although the Rhinos coach Brian McClennan remains hopeful that both he and Burrow will be fit for the World Club Challenge. The Rhinos did make a promising start, with Carl Ablett opening the scoring in the fourth minute with a simple try from Danny McGuire's long pass. But Kevin Sinfield dragged his conversion attempt wide and within six minutes Hull KR had hit back to take a 6-4 lead with a slick try of their own, Shaun Briscoe touching down Paul Cooke's delicate grubber kick, and Michael Dobson adding a straightforward conversion. Rovers dominated the remainder of the first half, and it was a tribute to the resilience of the Rhinos that they were restricted to two Dobson penalties. Leeds gained the reward for that defensive stint early in the second half, as they capitalised on a rare attacking chance to pull level. It was set up by Kallum Watkins, the teenage centre who came off the interchange bench and sent Scott Donald clear down the right, allowing Sinfield to hoist a bomb which Keith Senior flicked back for Ryan Hall to score. This time Sinfield clipped over a good equalising conversion. Senior went close to regaining the lead with a typically strong left-wing surge, only to be held up over the Rovers try-line by some desperate last-ditch defence. Hull KR then had a near miss as play swung from end to end, with Jake Webster claiming a try from Dobson's clever kick, only for the video referee Ian Smith to spot a tiny knock-on. That was to prove their last chance, meaning a scant reward of one point so far this season for Rovers despite impressive performances in drawing at Bradford last week and again last night. Perhaps it takes a while to learn to find victory from adversity, an art that Leeds seem to have mastered.
