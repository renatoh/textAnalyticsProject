Frankly, who cares. Top-eight ranking assured for World Cup draw and a job well done. ROOF OF THE DAY Cardiff's Millennium Stadium boasts a roof that can be closed in wet conditions, an excellent innovation that could teach Warsaw's football stadium a thing or two. The drawback? Having to take on the All Blacks in dry, still conditions. Generous. BROTHER WATCH At Twickenham South African lock Eben Etzebeth had a pop at Ben Youngs, whose brother Tom (right) immediately took exception and piled in to the skirmish. Followed by 25 others. SLIP OF THE DAY Sky studio anchor Alex Payne went to an ad break saying: \"We are still \u2026 er \u2026 England are still right in this at half-time.\" He immediately apologised to South African viewers.
