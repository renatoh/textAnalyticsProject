The Cherries scored three times during that 15-minute spell either side of the interval in a high-scoring play-off final to ensure their return to the Second Division after a year's absence. Although Lincoln reduced their arrears to 4-2, Bournemouth replied again through their captain Carl Fletcher, who finished the game with two goals to his name. Not bad for a central defender. There had been few indications during the opening half-hour of the attacking fiesta that was to follow. Bournemouth took the lead in the 28th minute when a free-kick from Carl Fletcher was nodded on by Marcus Browning. It fell conveniently for Steve Fletcher - no relation - to score with a sublime hooked shot. Lincoln had created next to nothing until they equalised seven minutes later. Peter Gain and Stuart Bimson worked a short corner which was met by a towering header from 6ft 7in defender Ben Futcher, son of Paul Futcher, the former Lincoln, Manchester City and Oldham player. A crude challenge by Simon Weaver on James Hayter, which earned him a booking, led indirectly to Bournemouth regaining the lead in first-half injury-time. The free-kick found its way to Gareth O'Connor lurking on the left. Carl Fletcher got the faintest of touches to his cross to put the ball in the net. Simon Yeo, who had scored three times as substitute for Lincoln during their 6-3 aggregate victory over Scunthorpe United in the semi-final, was then introduced again. Steve Purches welcomed him by putting Bournemouth further ahead, finishing off a sparkling right-wing move involving Hayter and Elliott. Fletcher's delightful pass sent O'Connor cutting in from the left to make it 4-1 on the hour. Mark Bailey planted a header beyond Neil Moss to put Lincoln back into vague contention, only for Carl Fletcher to have the last decisive word with another neat header.
