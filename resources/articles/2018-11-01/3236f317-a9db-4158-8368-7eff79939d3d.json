Retailers were hurt by weak results from Target, while the 6% drop in the crude oil price dragged energy producers down. Goodnight. GW The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 1.6% in late trading. The Dow is now flirting with a 600-point loss, down 2.3% today. Apple is now down 4.8%, as the tech selloff gathers pace. Microsoft has lost 3.1%, as has construction equipment maker Caterpillar. More reaction to today\u2019s losses: With barely an hour\u2019s trading to go, Wall Street is bobbing listlessly in the red. The Dow is currently down 529 points, or 2.2%, at 24,487. Many analysts are suggesting that Wall Street is entering a bear market, but David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, doesn\u2019t agree. He reckons we\u2019re going through a \u201cvery normal\u201d correction. Kelly don\u2019t think America is heading for recession, as the slowdown in the economy, and the trouble in the market, will deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. It may also encourage the White House to stop the trade war with China too. Mohamed El-Erian of investment group Allianz believes Donald Trump has helped push the oil price down today. A little while ago, the US president offered Saudi Arabia some support over the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi last month. Trump also questioned whether crown prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the killing -- despite the CIA concluding that he ordered it. Trump\u2019s intervention will infuriate those pushing for justice for Khashoggi, but it also cuts the chances that Saudi Arabia hit back at the US by slashing oil production (thus the drop in the oil price). Jim Cramer of CNBC reckons the selloff is partly due to margin calls - demands for investors to put up money to cover losses. That can often trigger further selling, if investors need to find the cash to hold those existing positions. Oil is also suffering from fears that the US-China trade war will escalate. Hopes are fading that US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping could make a breakthrough at the G20 meeting at the end of November. Last weekend, US vice-president Mike Pence and Xi swapped barbs at a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, says this has worried the markets: \u201cIn terms of the collapse today, the wider selloff in equities \u2013 sparked by weak retail and tech performance - has further exacerbated fears of weakening global demand amid a weaker economy and the spectre of escalations in the US-Sino trade war. The hopes that the US and China may be closer to a rapprochement were dashed at the APEC summit at the weekend, with expectations growing that a deal will not be struck at the G20 later this month, and subsequently new tariffs will be applied in the New Year. Rising US crude inventories are also pushing crude prices down, Kelty adds, even though oil producers have hinted at production cuts soon. While the news that OPEC+ said it would cut 1.4 million barrels of oil per day from production, it\u2019s looking likely that the cuts will have to be deeper in order to stabilise the price. We would anticipate further weakness until the reaction from OPEC+ and the G20 summit is clearer.\u201d The oil price has now slid by over 5% today, thanks to oversupply fears and worries about slowing economic growth (which equals less demand). Brent crude has dropped to just $63.23 per barrel, a drop of over $3 per barrel today. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, points out this takes oil deeper into a bear market (more than 20% off its recent peak). Fears of slowing global growth are fuelling concerns over global demand, just at a time when Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US continue to ramp up production The most recent Baker Hughes rig count increased by 2 last week, taking the number of rigs to 888, the highest number since March 2015. With oil trading heavily lower, the energy sector pipped tech stocks as the worst performer on the S&amp;P. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s Wall Street wobbles: Every stock on the Dow is in the red today, as the gloom sweeps across trading floors. Apple is the biggest faller, down 3.7%, followed by Goldman Sachs (-3.2%) and Microsoft (-2.6%). Energy stocks are also dropping, tracking the lower oil price today. Chevron is down 2.5%. There\u2019s no cheer on Wall Street this afternoon. The Dow is still deep in the red, down 439 points at 24,577, a drop of 1.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq has lost 1.26% - dragged down by Apple, amid ongoing worries about iPhone sales. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 53 points lower at 6948 points, down 0.75%. Other European markets were worse hit; Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1.6% and France\u2019s CAC finished 1.2% lower. A cocktail of worries are hitting stocks, as US investors take cover ahead of Thanksgiving. Fears over global growth, trade disputes, and the prospect of higher interest rates are all factors. Marketwatch explains: These doubts have accumulated to induce fears that we are growing nearer to the end of the current economic expansion, strategists say. Investors are particularly gloomy about technology companies. Tech stocks extended a decline that led the market lower Monday, with reports from China adding fuel to the day\u2019s selling after officials in Beijing uncovered widespread evidence of anticompetitive behavior by Korean rivals. Today\u2019s rout has dragged the US stock market back to its October lows, and rattled Europe too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: As a taster of the alarming tech trouble, Apple was down 4.6%, tumbling to a near 7 month low of $177 having been at $230 around 7 weeks ago; Microsoft fell by the same amount, with their Dow sibling Alphabet slipping 2.2%. Investors are concerned that sooner rather than later the sector is going to be fully embroiled in the US-China trade battle, exacerbating the softness caused by reports of a slowdown in iPhone demand. Obviously this caused the already moody European indices to have a fit. The CAC found itself the wrong side of 4900 as it lost 1.6%, with the DAX hitting a near 2 year nadir after dropping 200 points. The FTSE, meanwhile, slid 90 points, slumping back towards the 6900 lows seen during October\u2019s nightmare. Ouch! Wall Street has opened with heavy losses. The Dow has tumbled by 586 points, down to 24,430, erasing its gains for this year. Tech stocks are getting hit again, with Apple down 4.5%. Retailer Target is down 10% after posting disappointing results today. European stock markets are generally in retreat today, as traders worry about economic growth prospects, the US-China trade war, and Brexit. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed around 0.7%, while Germany\u2019s DAX has dropped by around 1.5% to a two-year low. With the oil price down 2%, and Bitcoin sliding, there\u2019s no shortage of nervousness in the markets. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: With equities (and cryptocurrencies) tumbling, volatility is clearly there, even if this week will be a quieter one for economic data. But can volatility remain elevated, especially towards the end of the week with the Thanksgiving holiday being observed on Thursday in the US (and on Friday in Japan)? Clearly some market participants would rather enjoy a long holiday break and await better opportunities next week. However, this time it may be different, and traders may actually hang around as volatility has not been at these elevated levels for prolonged periods in a while. Mark Carney refused to be drawn today on whether interest rates might rise or fall after Brexit, saying it all depends on the outcome. But Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues that borrowing costs are unlikely to rise in 2019, due to its habit of under-estimating UK inflation. Professor Milas explains: The BoE targets inflation 2 years into the future. Look at the attached plot where I put together: (a) the Bank\u2019s 2-year inflation forecast based on constant interest rates, (b) the Bank\u2019s 2-year inflation forecast based on market expectations of interest rates and (c) the actual inflation outcome. Unfortunately, both forecasts move in opposite direction to the actual outcome (correlation is negative) which is a real worry. Nevertheless, under constant interest rates, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by an annual average of 0.38%. Under market expectations of interest rates, however, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by much more, that is, by an annual average of 0.54%. This is telling me that with/without hard-Brexit, it is more likely than not that the policy rate will remain at 0.75% in the next 2 years. Concerns over Brexit might be assuaged by the latest healthcheck on UK manufacturing. British factory orders bounced back in November after falling sharply in October, according to the CBI\u2019s monthly survey. The balance of companies reporting above-average order books, rather than weaker, rose to +10 this month, up from -6 in October. That suggest UK goods are still in demand, despite the uncertainty over trading conditions after Brexit. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, warns that UK firms still need the \u201cright\u201d Brexit deal: The overwhelming message from business to the Government is to make progress, don\u2019t go backwards. \u201cWe need frictionless trade for our world-beating manufactured goods and a transition period which draws us back from the cliff edge. Anything less than that and jobs and investment could suffer.\u201d In other news, cryptocurrencies are having a bad day, again. Bitcoin has slumped by around 7% to below $4,500 - a blow to anyone who piled in when it was \u2018worth\u2019 almost $20,000 last December. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the recent trend of \u2018forking\u2019 cryptocurrencies into competing flavours, and the threat that regulators clamp down on \u2018initial coin offerings\u2019: Fundamentally speaking, the current sell-off is due to two main reasons; regulatory pressure and disagreement within the coin developer community, one of the biggest threats. The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security. The department issued civil penalties against two cryptocurrency companies because they failed to register initial coin offerings as securities. Investors will be given their refund and the firms will have to face fines. The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path. The community needs to stick together and work towards a more meaningful fork. This is because, developers, on the one hand, try to convince the world that the supply is limited and, on the other hand, they keep looking at ways of triggering another kind of forks. Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether. Today\u2019s hearing showed that the Bank of England remains very worried about a no-deal Brexit, says Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. Patel explains this would leave the Bank \u2018between a rock and a hard place\u2019, with falling demand and rising inflation to balance. \u201cFrom the Bank of England\u2019s perspective the biggest concern above all else is the threat of a disorderly Brexit. A tumultuous departure would leave the Bank in the impossible position of trying to manage the risk of rising imported inflation if the pound were to fall further, while also trying to create conditions that are supportive of growth through a difficult period for the economy. The Bank has been really clear and consistent in pointing out its view that Brexit uncertainty has stunted business investment, a key driver of growth. Therefore in the event of a disorderly Brexit, Carney and his colleagues would likely anticipate a further shrinkage in business investment and would be tempted to respond with stimulus, but that in turn makes it difficult for them to keep inflation down. That\u2019s why Mark Carney felt free to welcome Theresa May\u2019s plan, as a transition deal would remove some of the unpredictable risks facing the UK\u2019s economic and financial system.\u201d The committee hearing is over, so here\u2019s a quick recap. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given Theresa May\u2019s draft Brexit deal his backing. Speaking to the Treasury Committee this morning, Carney argued that a transition agreement would provide stability and confidence, and would be better for economic growth than the alternatives. Carney said: \u201cWe have emphasised from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u201d This isn\u2019t a great surprise, of course; the Bank has long been warning that Britain\u2019s economy would suffer from a hard break with the EU. But the timing is significant, just days before EU leaders decide whether to back the plan, teeing up a vote in Parliament before Christmas. MPs demanded to know whether the Bank was more likely to riase, or lower, interest rate if Britain left the EU without a deal. Carney, though, refused to commit, saying: \u201cThis would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.\u201d Bank policymakers also warned that UK firms aren\u2019t ready for Britain to crash out without a deal or a transition agreement. Chief economist Andy Haldane said that firms are increasingly worried about a no-deal Brexit. This is now hurting investment, and likely to drag on growth this quarter. Michael Saunders, an external member of its Monetary Policy Committee, said that few businesses have drawn up contingency plans; it\u2019s also too late for many to make plans before 29th March 2019. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe told the committee that the Bank would ensure that Britain didn\u2019t suffer a financial meltdown, as we saw in 2008. However, the big decision on Brexit must be taken by MPs, not the Bank. Saunders also warned that the Bank doesn\u2019t have the tools to magically fix the problems caused by a no-deal Brexit: If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. Andy Haldane then gives a pithy explanation of Britain\u2019s productivity crisis. He says that Britain has a longer tail of unproductive firms than other advanced economies. This has become worse since the financial crisis, such that even relatively productive firms in the second decile (the top 10%-19%) have been dragged down. Firms that were once the dog have joined the tail, Haldane says, to some laughter. Haldane does love a canine metaphor - in 2012, he compared setting financial regulation to a dog pursuing a frisbee. Q: Given all the talk about a no-deal Brexit, would it really be a shock if it happened? Mark Carney says there has been an expectation since the referendum that there won\u2019t be a disorderly Brexit. The fact is that a substantial proportion of companies, in a wide range of sectors, don\u2019t have contingency plans for a hard Brexit next spring. Onto wages, and the impact of migration on pay growth. Bank officials says earnings growth has firmed in recent months, over 3% per year. Michael Saunders argues that migration has been a source of growth, as workers coming into the UK have been better educated (on average) and brought skills that businesses need. A drop in inward migration would mean lower potential growth, and could mean lower actual growth too from lower consumer spending and a lack of staff, he warns. Q: But isn\u2019t there also a link between falling migration and recent pay growth? Pay is rising because the labour market is tight, Saunders insists. On business investment, BoE governor Mark Carney says he believes there is more downside risk from a no-deal Brexit than upside risk from a smooth deal. BoE chief economy Andy Haldane agrees, but also argues that the \u201cinvestment fundamentals\u201d are bright for many companies. The potential return on investment is in low-double digits, while the cost of Capex is 2-3%, he explained. Q: Do businesses have enough time to put credible Brexit contingency plans in place? BoE committee member Michael Saunders says financial firms have done a lot of work already. But non-financial firms are very uncertain how they should prepare, and unwilling to spend large amounts on things that turn out to be unnecessarily. He doubts whether contingency plans could now be drawn up in time. The risk of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit is uncomfortably high, Carney says -- reiterating a point he made in August. Q: What is the long-term impact of a no-deal Brexit? Carney says that short-term supply disruption includes queues at Dover, people being confused about how the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of contracts works. The Bank must distinguish between that, and long-term issues such as impact on demand, and labour supply. Mary Carney is now taking more questions about a no-deal outcome. The Bank needs to be in a position to support the UK if we ended up with no deal and no transition, by design or by accident, the governor says. He warns that some workers and capital could be \u201cstranded\u201d. There would also be an \u201ceconomic shock\u201d in Europe, particularly in Ireland, he adds - this wouldn\u2019t just be a problem for the UK. Carney also agrees with Michael Saunders\u2019 earlier point; most businesses haven\u2019t got contingency plans for no-deal Brexit. The main news line from today\u2019s hearing is that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has backed the Brexit deal unveiled by Theresa May last week. Carney told the Treasury committee that: \u201cWe have emphasized from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. \u201cSo we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u201d Carney also declared that this should \u201csupport economic outcomes\u201d; ie, avoiding the disruption and uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. He also told MPs that the Bank will provide its assessment of the proposal, and a \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome next week. However, it will not include the option of staying in the EU (something Theresa May said was possible last week). Carney explained: \u201cWe\u2019re not intending to look at providing additional analysis on the third scenario which is no Brexit at all.\u201d Q: Won\u2019t extending the transition period push up the cost of the Brexit divorce bill (from its current \u00a339bn)? Mark Carney notes that any extra cost should be weighed against the economic benefits. Q: Would a longer transition provide businesses with enough confidence to invest? Business investment has been falling for several quarters, he replies. An agreement with transition, and with some expectation of a deep economic partnership in the fullness of time, would provide more clarity for business..and one would expect that to support investment over time, he adds. Q: The [Brexit] text agreement suggests that the transition agreement could be extended until 20xx. Does that concern you, governor? It narrows it down, replies Mark Carney wryly. He then explains that this highlights just how long it would take to negotiate all the aspects of the economic partnership, and implement it. Monetary Policy Committee member Michael Saunders then reiterates his warning about a no-deal Brexit: Most businesses are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit, and don\u2019t know really how to prepare. Over the last month or two, as the risk of a no-deal outcome has become more visible, we\u2019ve seen business confidence weaken and rising uncertainty. And that may have a some negative effect on near-term economic activity. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warns MPs that the Bank of England can\u2019t solve Brexit for them. Cunliffe tells the Treasury Committee: It\u2019s not for us to say which is the right outcome. Parliament and government will take that forward. It\u2019s our job to be prepared for the worst,...and to provide parliament with information relevant to our mandate that is useful. Whatever the outcomes, people in the UK can have assurance that they won\u2019t see a financial sector meltdown of the sort as they say in 2008. That means people can have \u201ctrust in the institution doing its job\u201d, and delivering its inflation, Cunliffe explains, concluding: But how the outcomes will play out, and the choices, are down to parliament and government. Mark Carney reminds the committee that the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts have a range of outcomes -- and the upper end of those forecasts are based on the economy looking somewhat similar to \u201cthe status quo\u201d after Brexit. That\u2019s another hint that Theresa May\u2019s deal is better than a no-deal outcome. Rushnara Ali MP takes up the questioning, and accidentally calls Mark Carney \u2018chancellor\u2019 rather than \u2018governor\u2019. She then asks whether Britain is stuck between \u201ca rock and a hard place\u201d when choosing between Theresa May\u2019s deal and a no-deal Brexit. Carney doesn\u2019t \u201csubscribe to that characterisation\u201d. Instead, he says there is value in the PM\u2019s transition deal, all depending on what the UK is actually transitioning too. That means the political declaration about the final arrangement is very important. Q: Will interest rates be higher or lower after a no-deal Brexit? Honestly, it all depends, Mark Carney reiterates. Specifically, on whether it is more of a shock to demand (which might merit a stimulus from lower borrowing costs), or to supply (which could be inflationary, requiring higher rates) Carney explains that no-deal Brexit would be a \u201creal economy shock\u201d. Central banks have a role, but they\u2019re on a sidelines, he adds. BoE committee member Michael Saunders then weighs in, warning that moving to WTO rules quickly (if Britain left without a deal) would be a major supply shock. If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. So you can\u2019t assume that the Bank would cut interest rates, as it did in 2016 after the referendum. Q: If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, will the Bank boost its stimulus programme (to support the market) or raise interest rates (to support the pound)? It depends, Carney replies. There are very few previous examples of an advanced economy suffering a big supply shock, so the Bank doesn\u2019t have much evidence to go on. Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about last week\u2019s cabinet meeting on Brexit. Elphicke says that the pound jumped after Theresa May announced she had cabinet backing for her plan, but plunged the next morning when Brexit secretary Doninic Raab resigned. Elphicke claims that Raab had told the chief whip of his plans that night -- so shouldn\u2019t this information have been immediately released, as it was market sensitive? Carney points out that sterling volatility is already very high, showing that investors expect plenty of Brexit drama. He believes May\u2019s statement was appropriate. Political resignations aren\u2019t quite the same as corporate ones, he continues. The important thing is that anyone who has inside knowledge of events (such as Raab\u2019s plans) don\u2019t trade on them. Q: Governor, do you still believe that a no-deal Brexit is unlikely? We\u2019ll find out relatively soon, Mark Carney grins. He explains that the Bank has been preparing for such an outcome since June 2016, to protect financial stability. So even if it\u2019s a very low probability, the financial stability committee has been getting ready. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, then warns that Brexit uncertainty is causing more economic damage. \u201cWe are seeing somewhat greater impact, particularly on the behaviour of companies,\u201d says Haldane. That means growth will probably be \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the previous quarter (when growth rose to 0.6%). The Treasury committee begins the hearing by asking the Bank of England about Theresa May\u2019s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. Governor Mark Carney reminds MPs that the Bank has emphasised the important of a transition deal after Britain leaves the EU. He believes the withdrawal agreement would \u201csupport economic outcomes\u201d -- central banker speak for \u2018good for the economy\u2019 (at least compared to other outcomes...) Q: Will your advice to parliament (due next week) look at three scenarios -- the PM\u2019s deal, no deal, and no Brexit? Carney says he wasn\u2019t planning to provide additional advice on the idea that Brexit will not happen. Instead, the Bank will examine the withdrawal agreement, versus a \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome. This assessment will include the political declaration on the likely eventual relationship between the UK and EU \u201cas far as it can\u201d, the governor adds. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee have begun quizzing the Bank of England. In the hot seats, we have: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England, Andy Haldane, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Monetary Analysis &amp; Statistics, Michael Saunders, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England Back in the UK, the Bank of England has announced it will publish its assessment of the monetary and financial effects of Theresa May\u2019s draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit next week. This will give MPs the chance to read and digest the BoE\u2019s views, before they vote on the deal. It will include a comparison with a \u201cno deal, no transition\u201d scenario. Given the Bank\u2019s well-publicised views on Brexit, we can safely assume that it will conclude that May\u2019s deal is better than a disorderly exit from the EU. The report, alongside the Bank\u2019s latest stress test, will be published on Wednesday November 28th. Carlos Ghosn\u2019s arrest is an early test of Japan\u2019s new plea-bargaining system, brought in this year to target corporate wrong-doing. Under these rules, potential suspects can negotiate deals with prosecutors in exchange for information on another party. On Monday, Nissan explained that a \u2018whistle-blower\u2019 had brought Ghosn\u2019s misconduct to light, but didn\u2019t give more details. According to the Asahi newspaper, this referred to a company employee gave prosecutors information on Ghosn in return for lighter treatment. Deutsche Bank analysts have warned there is a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that Carlos Ghosn will lose his leadership role at Renault (where he is CEO and chairman), plus the chairmanships of Nissan and Mitsubishi. Forbes reports that Carlos Ghosn\u2019s ex-wife, Rita, has also weighed in: A scandal that brings down powerful people like Ghosn brings with it catcalls from people they have left in their wake. Ghosn\u2019s ex-wife, Rita Ghosn, posted this message to social media on Monday: \u201cAll narcissists are hypocrites. They pretend to have morals and values that they really don\u2019t possess. Behind closed doors, they lie, insult, criticize, disrespect and abuse. They can do and say whatever they want, but how dare you say anything back to them or criticize them. They have a whole set of rules for others, but follow none of their own rules, and practice nothing of what they preach.\u201d Rita and Carlos Ghosn have four children, all now grown-up. Following the couple\u2019s split, Carlos married his second wife Carole in 2016 - a union celebrated with a party at Versailles. My colleague Nils Pratley predicts that Ghosn\u2019s arrest will trigger an almighty battle between Japan and France for control of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. He\u2019s also struck by Nissan\u2019s willingness to \u201ctrash\u201d Ghosn, as if he\u2019d already been found guilty in the courts.... They do corporate scandals differently in Japan. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over alleged under-statement of income and \u201cnumerous\u201d acts of misconduct was spectacular in its own right, but the accompanying press conference by Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa was an event in itself. Saikawa did not merely report the allegations against his chairman, which is what you might expect on day one in equivalent circumstances at a European and US company. He also trashed Ghosn\u2019s legacy, criticised his decision-making and speculated as to how the alleged misdeeds could have happened. That content would normally be reserved for the full corporate post-mortem, or at least until the legal process had run its course. More here: More details of the allegations against Carlos Ghosn have emerged today. Public broadcaster NHK reported that Nissan paid \u201chuge sums\u201d to buy luxury houses for Ghosn in four cities around the globe. The properties, in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, were acquired \u201cwithout any legitimate business reason\u201d, it claimed. NHK also reported that Ghosn received some compensation due to other executives (it\u2019s not clear how this could have happened, though). More developments: Mitsubishi will hold a board meeting next week to decide whether to dismiss Ghosn as chairman. [reminder: Mitsubishi is partly owned by Nissan, making it the smallest member of Ghosn\u2019s auto alliance]. Newsflash: Renault says it will hold a board meeting later today to discuss the situation. Just in: France\u2019s finance minister has declared that Carlos Ghosn is no longer currently fit to lead Renault. Speaking on French radio, Bruno Le Maire also called for Renault to set up an interim management structure, following Ghosn\u2019s detention in Japan. He told France Info Radio that: \u201cCarlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault.... Renault has been weakened, which make it all the more necessary to act quickly.\u201d Le Maire\u2019s intervention is significant as the French government owns a 15% sake in Renault. Le Maire also said he had asked French tax authorities to examine Ghosn\u2019s affairs and that they had found nothing of particular note (thanks to Reuters for the quotes!) Renault\u2019s share price has dropped 3.3% at the start of trading in Paris, adding to yesterday\u2019s 8% slide. Traders are worried that its alliance with Nissan could be threatened by Ghosn\u2019s anticipated dismissal from the Japanese carmaker. Today\u2019s selloff has driven Nissan\u2019s share price down to its lowest level since July 2016. As you can see, it was already trading at a two-year low before Carlos Ghosn\u2019s shock arrest: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japanese carmaker Nissan is reeling today after its chairman Carlos Ghosn was dramatically detained by prosecutors for allegedly under-reporting his salary and misusing the company\u2019s assets. Shares in Nissan have plunged in heavy trading in Tokyo, ending down almost 5.5%, as the Japanese capital was gripped by Ghosn\u2019s dramatic fall from grace. This pulled the Nikkei down to a three-week low. Staff at Nissan\u2019s HQ in Yokohama are also in shock, after hearing that their board plans to dismiss Ghosn on Thursday for \u201cserious misconduct\u201d. At a gripping press conference late on Monday night, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, laid into Ghosn, saying: \u201cI feel a strong sense of indignation and despair.\u201d Astonishingly, Saikawa said he hadn\u2019t decided whether Ghosn was \u201ca charismatic figure or a tyrant\u201d, adding critically: \u201cI have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time.\u201d Earlier today, Japan\u2019s prosecutors confirmed that they are investigating whether Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn\u2019s compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 - as Nissan claim. The pair are accused of only reporting half of Ghosn\u2019s true salary, of almost 10 billion yen (\u00a369m) over the period. It\u2019s a shocking development, which threatens the whole future of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance created and led by Ghosn over many years. Renault\u2019s shares slumped to a three-year low on Monday, and may be under further pressure today. But the dramatic turn of events has also left some observers wondering if Ghosn is being unceremoniously shoved out of the door (and into the hands of the authorities) in a palace-style coup. Also coming up today MPs will be quizzing top officials from the Bank of England on the state of the UK economy this morning. Governor Mark Carney can also expect fresh questions about the Brexit negotiations, as Theresa May strives to get her draft deal past MPs. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suspects Carney would rather not be probed about Brexit issues at such a sensitive time. At such a politically sensitive moment Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is probably cursing the fact that he will have to not only answer questions on the central bank\u2019s outlook for the UK economy to the Treasury Select Committee later this morning, but he will also probably find himself dragged into the cross hairs of the current merits of the deal that the Prime Minister has cooked up with the EU, against the risks of leaving without a deal. His answers will inevitably invite scrutiny from both sides of the political divide.
