The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, speaking at a summit in Brussels, said that there was now \u201cenormous hostility\u201d among the EU27\u2019s heads of state and government to any further delay to Brexit. He said that while Ireland had \u201cendless patience\u201d it had become the firm position of a number of EU governments that the indecision in London needed to come to an end. An extension of the UK\u2019s membership requires the unanimous support of the 27 member states. The European council president, Donald Tusk, had warned the UK not to waste the seven-month extension granted in April. \u201cThere\u2019s very much a strong view across the EU that there shouldn\u2019t be any more extensions,\u201d Varadkar said on Thursday. \u201cWhile I have endless patience, some of my colleagues have lost patience, quite frankly, with the UK and there\u2019s enormous hostility to any further extension. \u201cSo I think an extension could really only happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK or perhaps even something like a second referendum if they decided to have one,\u201d the Irish premier continued. \u201cWhat won\u2019t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed.\u201d The comments appear to close off any chance of the significant renegotiation proposed during the Conservative leadership campaign by Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove. Talks with the EU, or attempts to find a majority in the Commons for a deal, would have to be concluded in a small window after the return of parliament from its summer break on 2 September. Varadkar went on to dismiss claims from Boris Johnson, the clear frontrunner in the race to No 10 Downing Street, that the UK could ditch the Irish backstop and find a solution that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland during a \u201cstandstill\u201d transition period after Brexit. \u201cI look forward to meeting him, look forward to hearing what he has to say,\u201d Varadkar said of the new prime minister being chosen by the Conservative party. \u201cBut there are a number of things which we\u2019ve very much agreed. \u201cFirst of all there will be European unity, that negotiations can only happen between the UK and the EU. We\u2019re not going to allow negotiations to be moved to an inter-governmental level in any way.\u201d The EU was agreed that \u201cthe withdrawal agreement is not going to be reopened but we are willing to consider amendments to the joint political declaration, and if there is no withdrawal agreement then there is no transition period for the UK\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no withdrawal agreement without a backstop and there\u2019s no implementation period without a withdrawal agreement,\u201d he added. Varadkar\u2019s comments echoed those of the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, earlier in the day. Rutte said an incoming prime minister needed to be flexible, and that he hoped that the rhetoric of the Tory leadership campaign would be dropped once a new leader was confronted with the reality of the UK\u2019s position. \u201cI hope that campaign is done in poetry, and governing is in prose, as I think Churchill said once,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cThat when they read all the briefs and get the details of where we are at the moment in the Brexit negotiations that the person in the prime ministership will realise that something has to be changed.\u201d Rutte added that there was no chance of a renegotiation and dismissed a time limit on the backstop. \u201cYou would have a time limit that ends in four, five, six years time? If there is no other solution for the border issue, and I don\u2019t think we will have anything in place in four or five or six years, purely technically. Given the present position of the British government it will be a hard border. Would we want that? I don\u2019t think so. That would be the end of the Good Friday agreement.\u201d Asked about the possibility of a further extension of the UK\u2019s membership past 31 October, when the country is currently set to leave with or without a deal, Rutte said he could see little point unless a new prime minister rethought Theresa May\u2019s decision to leave the single market and customs union. Rutte, who described himself as a \u201ccertified Anglophile\u201d, said: \u201cIf nothing is happening? If it would mean after 31 October again going through the rounds and these traditional talks \u2013 \u2018Can we make changes?\u2019 \u2018No we can\u2019t, because you have to change your red lines,\u2019 \u2013 [then] there is no point in having an extension. \u201cWhen a new prime minister comes in and asks for an extension we have to learn what his plan will be in terms of new elections, new referendum, making changes to the red lines the UK is currently holding \u2026 If there is no change on all those positions I cannot see why it makes any sense to negotiate longer.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to a nine-month EU extension granted in April to Britain. The duration was about seven months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
