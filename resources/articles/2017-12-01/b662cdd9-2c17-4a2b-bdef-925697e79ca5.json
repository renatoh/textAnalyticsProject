His second-round performance at the Hero World Challenge had been impressive enough before Woods cracked a 265-yard approach to within 15ft of the 9th hole. He converted for an eagle and sat alone at the summit of the leaderboard. Crowds whooped and other players took notice. Woods confirmed a front nine of only 31 shots. A social media frenzy was underway. In typifying the complex struggle Woods has endured to even get to a competitive environment at all, one step back succeeded the two forward. The 41-year-old played the inward half in one over par before signing for a 68, with Charley Hoffman\u2019s imperious 63 meaning Woods is five adrift of the halfway lead. Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood share second at nine under. Still, Woods declared this a \u201csuccessful\u201d round. When asked whether he still believed victory is a possibility, he offered a reply more typical of his heyday. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Woods did concede he would have gladly accepted rounds of 69 and 68 before the tournament started. Among those Woods has taken by surprise in reaching seven under inside 36 holes is his caddie, Joe LaCava. \u201cHe has definitely played better than I thought he could,\u201d said the experienced bag man. Woods was not unduly worried by a dropped shot at the last. It was inevitable after his drive found a horrendous lie. \u201cI built on what I did yesterday, I cleaned it up,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to go out there and just play, compete. \u201cAs I told you guys earlier this week, I didn\u2019t know what to expect because I hadn\u2019t played, I hadn\u2019t competed, I haven\u2019t had a fused back before in my life. \u201cThese are all new things. As you can see that even with the fused back, I still have some speed out there and these are all things I\u2019ve had to learn and will continue to learn. \u201cThis is a new body that I\u2019m getting used to. I felt like today I could have easily gotten to double digits under par. That would have put me probably one or two back but I think I\u2019m still in it. We\u2019ve got two more days and I think it\u2019s supposed to blow a little harder. If that\u2019s the case, I think a good solid round should get me up in there.\u201d Henrik Stenson, who partnered Woods on Friday, cited increased green speeds as being like a major championship. Woods struggled with the pace of long putts in particular. His long game, as was the case in the first round, appeared perfectly sound. The same applied to his physical condition. \u201cThere are no issues, none,\u201d said Woods of his back. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I went out and played nine straight days, back home and down here as well. My body\u2019s accustomed to playing. It\u2019s a little different playing tournament golf but the body\u2019s good.\u201d Hoffman laughed at the assertion he may become public enemy No1 by denying Woods what would be an extraordinary Albany victory. \u201cTo be completely honest, I said at the beginning of the week I hope he wins,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAnytime he\u2019s in contention or even playing brings a buzz to golf that we all need. We need him out here, we want him out here.\u201d Perhaps any wager on Hoffman in event of this particular two-man shootout would not be wise. How Woods would cherish the scene."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
