The Premier League champions moved level on points with Everton at the top of the table thanks to Roberto Firmino\u2019s first goal of the season and Diogo Jota\u2019s second\u2011half header, but had to come from behind when the VAR official, Andre Marriner, awarded Chris Wilder\u2019s team a penalty for a tackle by Fabinho on Oli McBurnie. Mike Dean had awarded a free-kick outside the area before VAR upgraded the punishment to a penalty converted by Sander Berge. \u201cThere was no foul,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIt is now six games into the season and in three of them we have been on the wrong end of these kind of decisions. We are not asking for an advantage \u2013 we just don\u2019t want to be disadvantaged. And that is the situation. The penalty gave Sheffield a proper boost. Until then they couldn\u2019t get to us. \u201cThen we lost a bit of patience but we scored a goal from our best attack of the first half, scored a second goal and I don\u2019t know any more if it is offside or not. Then we did get the second goal and Mo had an incredible chance. They had their moments too but we defended with big hearts. It has been a tough week with a lot of minutes and tough opponents, so I am really pleased.\u201d Chris Wilder disagreed about the spot-kick, saying: \u201cI thought it was. I\u2019ve been informed there might have been another couple as well. I thought their reaction to the challenge was quite telling.\u201d Overall the Sheffield United manager was pleased with how his team had played. \u201cThe performance was good, it had to be to come here and get an opportunity to get a result and I thought we had opportunities to get a result. \u201cThere is lots of disappointment in our dressing room. We got on the bus believing we could get a result and we get back on the bus disappointed we haven\u2019t got that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
