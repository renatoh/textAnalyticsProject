My fellow passengers are spreadeagled among the cornflakes. And the outsize windscreen wipers in front of the control panels on the bridge are howling a shanty. 'I've never known it worse,' remarks Captain Bob as the horizon heaves vertically. Not for the last time, he quotes Dr Johnson: 'Being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.' Back in the dining saloon, faces are starting to reappear in place of feet around the breakfast table. Michael, aged 79, brushes the sugar off his baseball boots and confesses to a talent for defying gravity. 'Many years ago, as a working man, my party trick was to jump on tables and bar stools from a standing position. And I must say, when one considers synchronised swimming, one wonders why table jumping was never an Olympic sport?' He and his wife, Anne, have been travelling the world on cargo ships for 30 years. They have mastered the gentle art of sloping discreetly into port via the tradesman's entrance, leaving the glamorous berths of luxury cruise liners to the members of the camcorder brigade. 'Oh yes, it is the way to travel, the way to travel indeed.' In due course, I get their gist. A week later, we are in Puerto Rico for St Valentine's day. Every woman in Ponce has been given a kitsch teddy bear wrapped in cellophane and stuffed into a basket. I am making do with Pedro, a tourist guide, and we are sipping margaritas on the boardwalk. Across the marina, yachts salsa on their moorings, while pelicans rise above them, comical with their huge wings and great jugs of beaks. Suddenly, our romantic sunset is ruptured. Towering in the background, vast and dingy and making no concession to the tinsel-town boardwalk, is the CGM Caravelle. I have difficulties recognising the vessel that is my home, with half the containers removed, but the residential skyscraper block in pristine white gives it away. 'Do you think it's ugly?' I ask Pedro. 'No,' comes his pragmatic response. 'It's industrial'. Cargo ships do not wait for passengers: when the last container has been lowered under the merciless glare of halogens, the next port beckons. Pedro drops me back at the docks and I flash my shore pass at the stevedores in orange boilersuits and helmets who point me in the direction of Crane No 8. Hapag-Lloyd, CGM/CMA, Geest, Genstar, Maersk, Nedlloyd, P&amp;O, Cronos, Triton, Uniglory, Columbus Line, Tex: these are the names that whistle past my porthole. There is an unmistakable shuddering as our gargantuan beast revs up. Down in the Suzler engine-room, gold-toothed Russians in ear-clamps and headscarves are oiling and massaging the outsize components of a brute that consumes 65 tonnes of crude oil a day, plus another six tonnes of diesel to generate enough electricity to supply a small village. Night has fallen over the Caribbean, and two tugs with protective tyres hanging off them have been tethered fore and aft. Captain Bob is smoking in front of the radar screen. 'Midships!' he orders. 'Midships!' repeats Sacha, the Russian helmsman. 'Steady on zero-two-zero,' directs the Puerto- Rican pilot. 'Zero-two-zero,' echoes Sacha. And so the mantra continues. A Russian helmsman, a Puerto Rican pilot, a British captain: if none of them is hugely proficient in the other's language, each has the requisite specialist vocabulary at his fingertips, and all are brought together under an Isle of Man flag. Such is the face of twenty-first century merchant shipping. Together, that is, with satellite fax, email, diagnostic weather systems, videos and PlayStation 2. A man in jail has more room, better food and commonly better company. Things have changed a mite since Samuel Johnson's day. But the weather hasn't. And the prospect of cobalt seas is still a long way off for the passengers at the breakfast table. We have opted for what Paul Theroux, referring to great railway journeys, calls travel as opposed to transfer, where the adventure begins on board and arriving is an added bonus. Cargo ships are the ultimate alternative to economy-class syndrome or deep vein thrombosis: one circuit of the vessel clocks up half a kilometre, and there are 136 steps to be climbed between the engine-room and the bridge. Right now, though, we feel cooped up like battery hens. Even Colin, an ex-Army officer with a flying phobia, is having second thoughts about his preferred method of transport. Dense fog in Felixstowe, snow in Rotterdam and blinding rain in Le Havre were all par for the course. But a week of Force 10 conditions and a swell that shows no signs of abating, not to mention a barrage of 25-hour days, as we pass through seven time zones, have finally got his goat. At least he acknowledges that mid-Atlantic is not a convenient spot for changing one's mind: 'You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube!' he booms. Cabin space for 12 passengers with 'a certain degree of strength, agility and fitness' is offered on board the spanking new CGM Caravelle and the more mature Fort Desaix, whose charming, old-world sociability seduces me on my return voyage from Martinique. Any more back-seat drivers and the ships have to employ a doctor. The Fort Desaix is part of a Lebanese-owned fleet of Romanian crews and French officers supplying Martinique and Guadeloupe on a weekly basis. It ferries every provision imaginable across the Atlantic, from cars, electricity pylons, Christmas trees and cement mixers to frozen chicken, yogurt, camembert and Chanel No 5. It returns with 6,300 tonnes of bananas and 144,000 litres of rum. The exuberant Commandant Gromil has a yarn or two to spin about the passengers he's handcuffed and frogmarched in his time. He is, indisputably, God in his floating kingdom of boxes, and he wastes little time reminding us about the coffin on board, and his right to issue birth and marriage certificates. His side-kick is Jean-Luc from Rouen, employed by the French National Meteorological Office to ride the high seas, blowing up a balloon twice a day and sending it into the stratosphere with electronic tagging equipment attached. Nice work, if you can get it. The Caravelle, meanwhile, conveniently drops us off at 10 Caribbean ports of call. We visit Port of Spain, Trinidad, in the run-up to Carnival, sample the night life of the Dutch Antilles, survey the ancient ruins of Cartagena, Colombia, and profit from a three-day stop in Puerto Limon, Costa Rica, to visit sloth sanctuaries and go crocodile spotting on river excursions. And all in the time it takes to unload and load, before returning to Europe laden with such delicacies as nail varnish, leather leaf-cut ferns, tropical flowers, pineapples, frozen fruit- juice concentrates and Jamaican coffee. But these are stories ahead of time, and the breakfast table needs clearing. Chef Vladimir is already banging the pans for lunch - 'stuffed pork lion', 'bouble &amp; squik' and 'Brussels spouts'. 'I like Perestroika. Not much, but it is a chance to change some thing in your life,' says Tanya, our stewardess from Murmansk, who has bought two flats in cash since she started earning in hard currency. Her monthly salary is nearly three times her father's annual state pension. The inequalities of world economics are nowhere more glaring than onboard ship. Awkward, too, are the discrepancies between industry and leisure: as passengers loll and read by the ship's pool, the endless tasks of painting and repairing, welding and derusting are carried out above and below us. Handled with care, however; this symbiosis makes for a peculiarly rich form of cultural exchange. Later, as if to redistribute the balance of things, I witness Nicolai, an ex-deep-sea diver, keeping fit by tethering his harness to the pool railings and thrashing energetically on the spot. By evening we are steering a calmer course between Madeira and the Azores. As we sail over mountains taller than the Alps, I sense the peaceful strangeness of a world turned upside down, where the traffic is all beneath the surface. I am learning how a person may have a thousand reasons for going to sea in a cargo ship (not least that you have a 200kg personal luggage allowance). My panorama of sea, sky and horizon through 360 degrees is suddenly obscured by Colin blustering with his binoculars. 'He's younger than us, of course,' Anne remarks to Michael. 'Well these days, my dear, who isn't?' her husband replies. And he turns to me: 'Now you may laugh, but it's a very serious matter, a very serious matter indeed.' There are times when this great vessel could be a ferry over the Styx, carrying us all off to the great hereafter.

Caribbean cruises: If you want to go the full-frills way, there are several cruises to the Caribbean starting in the UK, or sailing back across the Atlantic, though most fly passengers out to join ships and back again at the end.
