There is no limit if it is a great work of art. But how many of those have been created in our time? My experience of this exhibition was totally derailed by a fresh encounter with Jeremy Deller's The Battle of Orgreave. Six years ago, Deller persuaded a huge number of participants, including people who were there the first time round, to re-enact a clash between police and pickets that had taken place at this South Yorkshire village during the miners' strike. Here, a room of archive materials reconstructs not just the 1984 \"battle\" but also shows how Deller recreated it. In a second room, you can watch Deller's event on film. The strange tenderness of this artwork grows with time. It is a more effective art of memory than almost any I can think of. Deller's ability to bring passion into the cold world of the museum is astonishing. Here, he shows old 1980s newspapers and his imagination somehow gives them the yellowing authority of an installation by Joseph Beuys. Is it \"theatre\"? Yes is the claim of this exhibition, which explores how contemporary artists court a performative, self-conscious relationship with an audience. The Battle of Orgreave, I suppose, can be seen as an epic play. Nearby, Ulla von Brandenburg's theatre curtain tempted me to walk through it, imagining a greasepaint world that turned out to be a wall. Jeppe Hein's little mirrored labyrinth is surprisingly easy to feel lost in. Rita McBride's arena seating makes you wonder where the show is. This is a provocative and intelligent group of artists, but Deller is the Shakespeare of this wooden O. \u00b7 Until January 1.
