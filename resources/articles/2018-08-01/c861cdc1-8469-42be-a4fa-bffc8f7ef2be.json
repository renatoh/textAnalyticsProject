Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, is aware the governing body cannot compete with the financial lure of Premier League management but believes Southgate shares his view that there is \u201cunfinished business\u201d with the national team. Southgate\u2019s deal ends in 2020 and, providing England qualify for the European Championship that summer, it is understood the FA would be keen to extend it until at least the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019d like him to stay beyond 2020 and I think he would like that too but we haven\u2019t spoken about it in any depth because that would be a contract discussion and he\u2019s on holiday now so we\u2019ll talk about that when he gets back,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to make it competitive to make sure him and all of our people are competitively rewarded. We can never compete with a Premier League club in terms of pay.\u201d England reached a World Cup semi-final for the first time since 1990 in Russia before being defeated by Croatia in extra time. They also won a World Cup penalty shootout for the first time, beating Colombia in the last 16. Much of that success was attributed to the fastidious preparation carried out by Southgate and his lieutenants and an improved team spirit. \u201cHe\u2019s really blossomed,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIt was fantastic seeing him first hand in pressure situations. He fits the definition of the modern manager we want. He gets that it\u2019s not just picking the team but all the aspects behind it and has benefited from a world-class support team. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be the first to say that.\u201d Glenn claimed the FA is entering a new chapter following triumphs at the under-20s and under-17s World Cups and the possible sale of Wembley which could lead to a huge injection of cash into grassroots facilities. \u201cThe World Cup makes our work feel justified. It\u2019s reinforced a belief we\u2019re doing a lot right,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cOur target is to be a top-four team in the world and we\u2019re not there yet, so there\u2019s unfinished business.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
