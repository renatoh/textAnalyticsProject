Six of the 16-man Test squad that will tour England this summer are non-white, the most ever selected. Cricket and rugby in South Africa have been riven by arguments over the quota system introduced after the fall of apartheid to force the inclusion of black and \"coloured\" players into traditionally white-dominated sports. This has been achieved with varying levels of success, but not until yesterday's announcement has there been a South Africa squad with a level of non-white representation that went beyond what could be interpreted as tokenistic. \"We are a young side with plenty of exciting talent, but we are also starting on a new era with South African cricket and we see this tour as another step forward on that path,\" said the captain, Graeme Smith. Suggestions that yesterday's squad was manipulated to satisfy political demands from the government were offset by the announcement of a cumbersome 17-man party for the one-day triangular involving Zimbabwe, a squad which contains only four black players. Three of the six black players in the Test party were among the \"bankers\" of the squad. Herschelle Gibbs is one of the game's most devastating openers, Makhaya Ntini is a fast bowler of pedigree and Paul Adams, the unconventional wrist spinner, is a proven wicket-taker - if costly at times. The orthodox left-arm spinner Robin Peterson keeps the vastly more experienced Nicky Boje out of the side but Boje's record is less than spectacular at Test level and Peterson undoubtedly has earned his chance. A reserve wicketkeeper was always regarded as essential for the tour and the 22-year-old Western Province gloveman Thami Tsolekile has brilliant hands and has the potential, in time, to bat in the top six. He is also the incumbent South African A gloveman. Most contentious is the choice of Monde Zondeki. The fast bowler was a member of the World Cup squad but seriously injured his shoulder in a car crash soon after his country's exit and has not bowled a ball since. But in most countries a gamble on a young fast bowler as the last man in large squad is seen as virtually compulsory and Zondeki, at only 20, has more potential than any other young paceman in the country. The selectors left significant casualties in their wake. Lance Klusener, once a national hero, has been cut from the body of South African cricket like a troublesome wart - which is what many people within the country's cricket community believe he had become. It was Klusener's muttered comment in the dressing room after the Duckworth-Lewis- affected tie with Sri Lanka during the World Cup in Durban, which saw South Africa eliminated in the first round, that decided his fate. As several team-mates dissolved into tears around him Klusener was heard to ask what all the fuss was about: \"At least we've got an extra two weeks to go fishing.\" South Africa Test squad: G Smith (capt), M Boucher (vice-capt,), P Adams, B Dippenaar, H Gibbs, J Kallis, G Kirsten, N McKenzie, M Ntini, R Peterson, S Pollock, D Pretorius, J Rudolph, T Tsolekile, C Willoughby, M Zondeki. South Africa one-day squad: G Smith (capt), M Boucher (vice-capt), P Adams, N Boje, A Dawson, H Gibbs, A Hall, J Kallis, C Langeveldt, N McKenzie, A Nel, M Ntini, S Pollock, D Pretorius, J Rudolph, M van Jaarsveld, M van Wyk.
