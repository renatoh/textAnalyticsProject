Italy feel at home on Via Flaminia, where Wales and Scotland have come a cropper in the Six Nations, but Ireland certainly have history on their side in the Eternal City. In the four championship fixtures here the Irish have always come away victorious and the wins have been convincing, on average by just over 20 points apiece. No wonder Italy's coach Nick Mallett admitted this week that his team would need to play the perfect game to upset the odds this weekend. Never mind the recent past, the present is dire enough for Mallett. Last weekend's decision to play Mauro Bergamasco at scrum-half backfired like a rusty old Fiat. It is the kind of decision that costs a coach his job. Mallett is a shrewd man and he knows that. The great flanker is back in the back row tomorrow but the humiliation of Twickenham will have sent his and the team's morale to new depths. Mallett has brought back the New Zealander Paul Griffen, he of the JPR Williams sideburns, at scrum-half to partner an Australian, Luke McLean, tomorrow. There is constantly talk in Italian rugby of an end to imports but needs must and Italy need a win badly. The Azzurri are regressing fast. But in Mauro Bergamasco, the No8 Sergio Parisse and the tight-head prop Martin Castrogiovanni they have three players who can compare favourably with any in their positions in Europe. A fourth, Marco Bortolami, though, limped off with a knee injury at Twickenham and has failed to recover. Another hammer blow for Mallett.The Rovigo lock Tommaso Reato replaces Gloucester's Bortolami tomorrow but it is a huge step up and competing with Paul O'Connell, who has been in such commanding form for Munster and Ireland, will be difficult. \"I believe that Tommaso can offer more security than Carlo Antonio Del Fava, who has played so little lately,\" said Mallett. With England coming to Croke Park in a fortnight's time, Ireland's 30\u201321 victory over France has given them every hope of three wins in a row. Declan Kidney has named an unchanged 22 and with Munster's Keith Earls now fully fit and training this week and the luxury of leaving Gordon D'Arcy on the bench, the coach has no shortage of talent behind the scrum. Brian O'Driscoll's try last weekend showed the centre may have passed 30 last month but his pace and power is not on the wane. Kidney urged caution: \"They are a team of experienced men who know how to garner their resources and in the second half against England they tightened up and got stronger and stronger. When you go into a match like this Sunday you can't be too surprised if we only get 40% of the possession and if your discipline isn't right they'll pick off their points and it could be a difficult day.\" Kidney knows, though, that Italy turning the tide of history is less likely than an English victory in Cardiff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
