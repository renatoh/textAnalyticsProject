I am, however, deeply proud that this inaugural award is being presented to an environment minister,\u201d Hunt told the summit as he accepted the award. \u201cThe environment is our common heritage, our land, our home and our identity. As an Australian I also see this as recognition of the profound work Australia has done in the environment space \u2013 and I thank you for that.\u201d In an interview with Fairfax Media, Hunt described his win as \u201creally an award for Australia\u201d. The World Government Summit describes itself on its website as \u201cthe primary global forum dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide\u201d. \u201cEach year, the summit sets the agenda for the next generation of governments with a focus on how they can harness innovation and technology to solve universal challenges facing humanity,\u201d the website says. Hunt last year approved expanding the Abbot point coal terminal in northern Queensland, a move that will allow coal from other projects, like Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, to be shipped for export. In 2014, Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions dropped 1.4% in the second full year of the carbon tax, the largest recorded annual decrease in a decade. The tax was abolished by Hunt under the Abbott government. \u201cThe aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in positive changes in their communities,\u201d the United Arab Emirates minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told the summit as he gave Hunt the award. \u201cOur world today needs ministers to serve as role models of thought and action, which bring about progress and welfare and improve general societal wellbeing.\u201d Nominations came from more than 80 countries, with part of the criteria leading \u201cquality successful initiatives at the public sector level that serve the needs of citizens\u201d. Speakers at the summit included US president, Barack Obama, and the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim. An Australian government report released in December revealed Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions increased in the year to the end of June 2015 by 0.8% and by 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into account. Australia generated 549.3 mega-tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2014-15, the report shows. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said of Hunt\u2019s win: \u201cI\u2019d like to see what competition he was up against.\u201d Asked by reporters in Canberra what he thought led to Hunt receiving the award, Shorten said: \u201cWell, goodness only knows what the entrance requirement was into that competition. \u201cWe see the rate of emissions going up, not down. The only way we\u2019re going to tackle climate change isn\u2019t by giving awards to ministers in Dubai, it\u2019s by having a focus on renewable energy, it\u2019s about committing to real action on climate change.\u201d The Greens MP Adam Bandt questioned the win, telling reporters in Canberra: \u201cSomeone has a good sense of humour.\u201d \u201cHe has done precious little to tackle climate change,\u201d he said. However nobel laureate Professor Peter Doherty, who has researched the impact of climate change on heath, said Australia\u2019s action on climate change would be lessened had it not been for Hunt. \u201cMy perception of Greg Hunt is that, during a very difficult time for climate and environmental science during the Abbott era, he did his best to defend these areas,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe may not be delighted with every decision associated with his office, but my personal sense is that, in these times of constrained budgets, things would have been worse without him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
