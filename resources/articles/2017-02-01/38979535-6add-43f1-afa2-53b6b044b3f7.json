In a sign of growing fears about May\u2019s vision for Brexit, Bertie Ahern took aim at the prime minister over her recent white paper, in an interview with the Observer. Ahern, who served three terms as taoiseach between 1997 and 2008 and helped to deliver power-sharing in Belfast, said that the British government appeared to have resigned itself to the establishment of a border between the north and south once the UK leaves the EU in 2019, with potentially devastating results. \u201c[May] seems to be switching her language,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s saying not that there\u2019ll be no border, but that the border won\u2019t be as difficult as to create problems. I worry far more about what\u2019s going to happen with that. It will take away the calming effects [of an open border]. Any attempt to try to start putting down border posts, or to man [it] in a physical sense as used to be the case, would be very hard to maintain, and would create a lot of bad feeling.\u201d In its Brexit white paper published last month, the government stated its aim to have \u201cas seamless and frictionless a border as possible between Northern Ireland and Ireland\u201d. The secretary of state for exiting the EU, David Davis, has suggested that the arrangements between Norway and Sweden could be a model to copy, where CCTV cameras equipped for automatic number-plate recognition are in place. However, in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt appeared to scorn such a model, given that there would need to be customs checks and restrictions on the free movement of people. Ahern said he, too, was unconvinced that the current technology could do the job. There are 200 crossing points on the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, with 177,000 crossings by lorries a month, 208,000 by vans and 1.85m by cars. \u201cI haven\u2019t found anyone who can tell me what technology can actually manage this,\u201d Ahern said, adding that he feared the furious reaction of the unionist communities in the mid-1980s when the Republic was given an advisory role in the government of Northern Ireland could be repeated on the nationalist side if controls were reinstated. \u201cAny kind of physical border, in any shape, is bad for the peace process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt psychologically feeds badly into the nationalist communities. People have said that this could have the same impact on the nationalist community as the seismic shock of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement on unionists, and I agree with that. \u201cFor the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday agreement was about removing barriers, integrating across the island, working democratically in the absence of violence and intimidation \u2013 and if you take that away, as the Brexit vote does, that has a destabilising effect. \u201cWith so many other issues, there is a real concern \u2026 the only way [of] doing this will be a hard border. When people talk about hard borders, they\u2019re talking about the borders of the past \u2013 but now any kind of border with checkpoints and security constitutes a hard border.\u201d Ahern\u2019s comments were made as an EU document leaked to the Observer appeared to dash May\u2019s hopes that the two states can come to a bilateral agreement. The British prime minister has repeatedly suggested that the 1923 Common Travel Area deal can be the basis for the future, although it was signed before either state joined the EU. However, a memo from the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee, which is helping shape the negotiating position of the European commission and the red lines of the European parliament, rebuffs that suggestion: \u201cThe [Good Friday] agreement makes it abundantly clear that the fact that both parts of Ireland and the UK are within the EU is a basis for the agreement. Moreover, the fact that Brexit could result in the reintroduction of border controls and controls on the free movement of persons between Ireland and Northern Ireland means this is a question for the EU, and not only Ireland the UK.\u201d The European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said he fears Britain will divide the EU\u2019s 27 remaining members by making different promises to each during its Brexit negotiations. \u201cThe other EU 27 don\u2019t know it yet, but the Brits could promise country A this, country B that and country C something else and the end game is that there is not a united European front,\u201d he told German radio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
