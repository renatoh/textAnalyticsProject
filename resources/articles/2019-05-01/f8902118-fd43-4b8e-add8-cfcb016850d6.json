A thin waxing crescent moon will appear close to Mars. The moon will be just 16% illuminated, making it appear as a sliver in the sky. It acts as a useful signpost for finding the constellation of Gemini, which is standing upright in the western sky by mid-late evening. Mars will be slightly lower and to the north. The chart shows the view looking west at 21:30 BST on 8 May 2019. There will still be some twilight close to the horizon but this should not hamper your view of either target. Those who like a challenge can look the day before. The moon will be an even thinner crescent but will be right next to Mars. The red planet is currently getting lower each night as it heads behind the sun. It will finally be lost to the summer sunset glare in July, reappearing in October in the morning dawn sky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
