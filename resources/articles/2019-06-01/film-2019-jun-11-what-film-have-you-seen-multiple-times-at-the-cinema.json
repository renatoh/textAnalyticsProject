His claim means he will have beaten the current Guinness World Record holder for most times seeing the same movie in the cinema, a title previously held by Tony Mitchell, who saw Infinity War, the precursor to Endgame, 103 times. Just in case anyone might doubt Alanis\u2019s efforts, he\u2019s kept his receipts and tweeted a picture of himself with a member of staff on each visit. Share your experiences Is there a particular film that you\u2019ve been to see multiple times at the cinema? Do you consider yourself a superfan and if so, how do you stack up against the competition? Or perhaps you won your superfan title unwittingly \u2013 was there a film that you ended up seeing more times than intended or a cult classic that you\u2019ve been to see at cinemas again and again over the years? We\u2019d love to hear about why one film is so special to you. To get in touch, fill out the form below \u2013 we\u2019ll feature a few of our favourite contributions.
