We failed to note that the Crown Office had been at pains to point out that Boruc was cautioned not about \"blessing himself\" but about other alleged gestures towards the crowd. He was cautioned after the procurator fiscal, having reviewed all the circumstances, decided that criminal proceedings were not necessary. The letter to Boruc from the procurator fiscal made no mention whatsoever of the act of blessing himself. In a comment article headlined The only crime that this will stop is travelling while Asian (page 32, August 17) we incorrectly suggested that Nezar Hindawi, who was jailed in 1986 for trying to blow up an El Al flight, had had links to the Libyan government. We should have said he had alleged links to the Syrian government. The cutaway diagram of the \"Nimrod MR2\", page 5, September 4, was in fact of a Nimrod R1, operated by 51 Squadron, RAF Waddington. The R1 is an aircraft with a different role to the MR2. The main distinguishing feature of the MR2 is the addition of an extended MAD (Magnetic Anomaly Detector) boom at the rear of the aircraft. In a report headed On the breadline, page 3, Work, September 2, concerning the national minimum wage, we mistakenly stated that there was no legal requirement to pay statutory sick pay until the employee had worked 12 weeks. The reference should have been to company sick pay, not statutory sick pay. \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
