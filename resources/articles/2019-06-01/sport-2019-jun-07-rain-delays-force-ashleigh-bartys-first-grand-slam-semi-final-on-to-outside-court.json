The decision, taken after rain wiped out Wednesday\u2019s play at the French Open, was branded \u201cunfair and inappropriate\u201d by WTA\u2019s chief executive, Steve Simon, and a former women\u2019s No 1, Amelie Mauresmo, said it was \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Australian No 1 Barty plays unseeded teenager Amanda Anisimova for a place in Saturday\u2019s final in Paris but will do so on outer court, Suzanne Lenglen. The men\u2019s semis \u2013 which were always scheduled for Court Philippe Chatrier \u2013 will be the only matches played there on Friday. Johanna Konta and Marketa Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 will contest the other women\u2019s semi-final on Court Simonne Mathieu. Both women\u2019s matches are scheduled to start at 11am local time. The first of the men\u2019s matches \u2013 the potential classic between heavyweights Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal \u2013 is slated to begin at 12.50pm local time, although rain and high winds are forecast again and delays are possible. Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem follow. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that scheduling has been challenged by weather conditions, and the WTA understands the scheduling issues presented at Roland Garros,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWe are, however, extremely disappointed by the scheduling of both women\u2019s semi-finals on outside courts. This decision is unfair and inappropriate. The four women who have played so well and made it this far have earned their right to play on the biggest stage. \u201cWe believe other solutions were possible which would have been to the benefit of fans as well as all players.\u201d Chatrier, which was renovated this year, is the showpiece stadium at Roland Garros and has a capacity of 15,000. Lenglen holds 10,000. Mathieu is a new, partially sunken arena that opened only this year and accommodates just 5,000. \u201cThe scheduling of the women\u2019s semis tomorrow at Roland Garros is a disgrace,\u201d Mauresmo said. \u201cEveryone agrees that the match of the day is Federer-Nadal. But what kind of message do we send when taking the decision to put the women\u2019s semis at 11am on the second and third courts of the tournament? Not even one of them on centre court.\u201d With Paris braced for more bad weather, more delays are possible and the women\u2019s final could be moved back to Sunday. Potentially the men\u2019s may not take place until Monday. The tournament director, Guy Forget, said a Sunday finish was always preferable, but the worst-case scenario had to be considered. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we hope, but if we have no other choice, then that\u2019s what we will do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we have uncertain weather, of course, it\u2019s very hard to predict scheduling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
