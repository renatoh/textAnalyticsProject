I didn't want to be a commuter. I wanted an outdoor life, excitement and travel and to make a difference. I was technically minded and the Royal Navy offered me a career as a weapons engineer. What does being a Rear Admiral entail? I am director general of the logistics fleet (Royal Navy) at the Defence Logistics Organisation in Bristol. Has religion played a role in your career? It is the underpinning for my moral code and the navy is a very moral organisation. I view Islam, Christianity and Judaism as fundamentally the same. Are you happy to be labelled the highest ranking Muslim in the armed forces? I don't particularly like it. But the armed forces now collect data on ethnic minorities. I'm very conscious of under-achievement by Bangladeshi and Pakistani kids. Not enough see the armed forces as a viable career. If the label changes that, it can only be good. What race do you describe yourself as? Caucasian. Why do you think so few ethnic minorities reach the top of the armed forces? There are now five Muslim officers in the Royal Navy. I'm 48 years old and joined in 1976. It takes 30 years to get to my rank. My generation is just coming through. What's your advice for those trying? The same as for anyone: work at it and be strong and your talent will shine through. What are the barriers? The armed forces are a meritocracy. A third of Royal Navy engineers joined as sailors. How many organisations can say a third of their middle managers started on the shop floor? What about racial discrimination? If you are operating in hostile conditions, your survival depends on the close-knit team you are working with. So you have to respect the person next to you. Have you experienced discrimination because of your faith? The humour was a bit caustic 30 years ago and a cheese omelette was the only alternative on the menu to pork, but what was acceptable then in society is not acceptable today. How are the armed forces addressing discrimination? They are now more responsive and sensitive to the individual. What is the best piece of management advice you have received? Find something you enjoy and do it. When it stops being fun, go and find something else. Who is your leadership guru? Winston Churchill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
