On Tuesday Rush\u2019s barrister in the appeal, Bret Walker SC, told the federal court in Sydney that the \u201cawkward reality\u201d was that the evidence of the newspaper\u2019s star witness, Eryn Jean Norvill, had been contradicted by a number of her colleagues. The Daily Telegraph through its parent company, Rupert Murdoch-owned Nationwide News, on Monday began its appeal against the federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s ruling that the newspaper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d. During the trial Norvill, who made the initial complaint about the actor to the Sydney Theatre Company following the 2015 production of King Lear, told the court that Rush \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s best-known actors \u2013 engaged \u201cdaily\u201d in a pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d including \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and groping gestures that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d, \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. The newspaper is seeking a retrial because, it says, the judge erred in finding that Norvill gave unreliable evidence. But on Tuesday Walker said the evidence of a number of witnesses during the trial had been \u201csquarely against\u201d Norvill\u2019s version of events, including the pre-eminent theatre director Neil Armfield and Norvill\u2019s co-star Helen Buday. During the trial Armfield denied Norvill\u2019s claim that he had told Rush he was being \u201ccreepy\u201d during a scene with her. \u201cTo put it mildly, his evidence did nothing to corroborate Ms Norvill\u2019s evidence,\u201d Walker said. In his judgment Wigney found Norvill\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only uncorroborated but contradicted\u201d by other witnesses. He said in his judgment he \u201cwas not ultimately persuaded that Ms Norvill was an entirely credible witness\u201d. On Monday the Daily Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC, argued the court should overturn Wigney\u2019s judgment because his findings about Norvill\u2019s credibility were \u201cglaringly improbable\u201d. He raised five examples of Wigney\u2019s judgment about Norvill, including his finding that the actor did not need to make \u201chighly complimentary\u201d comments about Rush during an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald to promote the play in 2015. \u201cThese were press conferences in support of the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of King Lear, this is not mainstream entertainment, this is not a Harry Potter movie,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cWhat is Ms Norvill supposed to do? Is she supposed to be guarded, or heroically pure at a press conference? Mr Rush was obviously, apart from being a distinguished actor, obviously a great drawcard for this production, I mean she had to talk him up.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Walker said on Tuesday the interview was \u201cscarcely a promising start\u201d for the judge in weighing up her credibility that she had said \u201cthings she believed to be wrong \u2026 in order to enhance her position in work\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, \u2018believe me, I was lying, and here are the reasons I was lying, it\u2019s what one does on these occasions\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201c[But there is] nothing creditable about people carrying on in that fashion, advertising is not creditable, PR is not creditable, when it knowingly says that which is false. \u201cWe should not be coarsened, in effect, when it comes to truth telling because everyone does it. It\u2019s not in your favour or credit that you fall into that crutch.\u201d Justice Jacqueline Gleeson interrupted and asked whether it was \u201cnot to her credit, but not materially to her discredit\u201d, which Walker agreed with. Rush is due to receive $2.9m, including $1.97m in special damages based on past and future lost earnings \u2013 the largest defamation payout to a single person in Australia. On Monday lawyers for the Daily Telegraph dramatically dropped the newspaper\u2019s claim that Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d. Blackburn also says the judge was wrong to award special damages to Rush based on an \u201cinference\u201d of future lost earnings because over three days in the witness box the actor made a \u201cstartling omission\u201d in not expressly telling the court he could no longer work as a result of the articles. But Walker said Blackburn\u2019s argument was a \u201cdistinctively over-egged pudding\u201d, saying that during his evidence Rush had described his mental state following the articles as being \u201cincompatible with the capacity to do what he did\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
