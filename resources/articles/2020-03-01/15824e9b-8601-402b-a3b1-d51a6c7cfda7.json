Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. \u201cBut, while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.\u201d Talking about it won\u2019t make it happen. Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you\u2019ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London\u2019s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas. Well, not quite. There\u2019s a corpse at a millionaire\u2019s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death. The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay\u2019s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a \u00a330m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are \u201cthe best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine\u201d. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions. Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn\u2019t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett\u2019s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn\u2019t. Whodunnit? \u201cMost murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,\u201d McDonald tells the Crocketts. \u201cMaybe where you come from. But not here,\u201d scoffs Crockett\u2019s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath\u2019s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: \u201cWho ate all the lemons?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,\u201d says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. \u201cWe play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?\u201d McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn\u2019t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf. Monsters. I don\u2019t want to endorse the stereotype that Dodds is pale, male and stale, but he wears a tie under a tank top, which is so wrong I don\u2019t know where to start. He may have eyebrows, but they are sneaky ones, so blond that they pass unnoticed on his pasty face. As a result, Jason Watkins, who plays Dodds, has to use not his eyebrows but minimal eye movement to suggest his character\u2019s default mode of existential bewilderment. Watkins was so adorable as W1A\u2019s floral-shirted BBC drone who was literally good for nothing but folding Hugh Bonneville\u2019s Brompton (not a euphemism) that he surprises here as someone with unexpected professional gifts. Dodds breaks the case by spotting a peregrine falcon near the Crockett mansion. Its nest in a nearby church tower, he realises, will be ringed with RSPB-installed cameras, which will show who broke in to the Crocketts\u2019 mansion and offed the stiff. \u201cGood work with the penguin falcon,\u201d says McDonald, still not convinced her new partner isn\u2019t a chump. \u201cPeregrine,\u201d he corrects, saddened by her ignorance of local fauna. The writer, Robert Murphy, has created a lovely double act. Not since Felix Unger tried to vacuum Oscar Madison\u2019s drapes (again, not a euphemism) have I enjoyed the venerable trope of the odd couple so much. Don\u2019t get attached? Too late, ma\u2019am. I already am."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
