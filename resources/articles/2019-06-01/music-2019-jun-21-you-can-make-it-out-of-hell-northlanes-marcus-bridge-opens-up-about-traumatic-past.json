They were depths from which their father would never return \u2013 and Bridge, now 27, is hellbent on turning his traumatic past into something positive. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tell this story,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI think the other guys in the band knew that.\u201d Bridge\u2019s band, Northlane, has reached heights enjoyed by few Australian heavy acts, winning two Arias and selling out countless shows. Their experimental metalcore features sprawling soundscapes and dense breakdowns, alongside abstract, forward-thinking lyrics. But for their fifth album Alien \u2013 Bridge\u2019s third, after joining Northlane in 2014 \u2013 the band and its frontman are ready to tell a more personal story: of addiction, domestic violence and childhood abuse. In his early teens, Bridge says, he was under the guardianship of his father and subjected to verbal and physical abuse by him. At the age of 19, he was living with his grandparents on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches when he learned that his dad had died after an overdose. \u201cI thought you were dreaming / eyes rolled to the stars,\u201d he recalls in Bloodline, the first single from Alien \u2013 and the first song written for the album. Ties with his motherwere severed. Of his relationship with her, Bridge has said: \u201cEven though [she\u2019s] still here, I\u2019ve already said goodbye.\u201d Bloodline\u2019s video clip is set in a squalid room with a filthy mattress and ragged curtains \u2013 an eerily accurate depiction of the places Bridge stayed throughout his childhood. \u201cI was raised in hell / I made it out by myself,\u201d he sings. He found the shoot confronting. \u201cGoing to that house and walking into that scene was like walking into a time capsule,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I didn\u2019t anticipate \u2013 I didn\u2019t think was going to happen like that. \u201cActually being there, and seeing it, and being in that environment really took me back. I\u2019ve only watched the video once or twice since it\u2019s been out, because it\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d When Bridge was just seven, a man broke down the door of a Kings Cross motel, stormed in and levelled a gun at his dad. \u201c\u2018Please don\u2019t kill me in the face of my son and daughter,\u2019 I still hear them screaming,\u201d he sings in the album track Freefall. Sleepless, meanwhile, is a shattering depiction of their mother\u2019s inability to prevent Bridge\u2019s sister from succumbing to substance abuse herself. (His sister is now clean and the pair are close.) These are harrowing stories, even in short form, but Bridge says while society is slowly becoming more open to discussions of domestic violence, childhood domestic violence remains in the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s often masked with metaphor, or presented in the least offensive way it can be,\u201d he says. Authentic discussion, meanwhile, ought to \u201cmake you feel uncomfortable\u201d. This is what he hopes the album will achieve. \u201cI think people will be able to feel that tension; the uncomfortable feeling through these songs. And that was exactly what I wanted to do. It\u2019s small steps. It\u2019s a matter of just doing anything you can to get that conversation going.\u201d It\u2019s a difficult conversation to have in music, particularly within Bridge\u2019s genre, where darkness, suffering and drug use are often celebrated. \u201cThere\u2019s been occasions where I feel like this idea of \u2018heroin chic\u2019 has been glamorised,\u201d he says. \u201cIt bothers me a lot, because it\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Should Northlane take home the heavy metal Aria award for a third time, they\u2019d be the first band to do so. But Bridge says Alien, their first self-produced record, comes with a different metric for success: \u201cEncouraging an acceptance of people who had a tough upbringing and not judging someone because of it,\u201d he says. \u201c[Showing that] you can make it out of that hell \u2026 You can defy those odds.\u201d \u201cPeople will be able to relate to the lyrics in some way, from the mildest form to the most severe \u2013 or, even if they don\u2019t relate to it, it\u2019s still an insight into someone like me, or someone who\u2019s had similar experiences.\u201d How his family feels about the record is an afterthought. After all, he says, he wrote the songs \u201cto escape that\u201d. But he does make a concession. \u201cIf my mum was to hear some of these songs, I think it would be for the best \u2026 It is going to be quite hard and upsetting for her, but I think it\u2019s something that might need to happen.\u201d \u2022 Alien by Northlane is out 2 August. The band will begin a world tour in July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
