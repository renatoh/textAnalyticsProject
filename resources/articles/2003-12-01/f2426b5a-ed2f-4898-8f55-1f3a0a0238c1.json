But people always open up more when they are on holiday. When we are abroad in the Mediterranean most people consume a lot more alcohol than back home and consequently let their inhibitions go. We also believe a tan makes us look better and the atmosphere of being on holiday makes it feel as if life is more natural than in the UK, where people are given knock-backs. The ideal place to strut is a Greek island called Skyros. It's a holiday island where you can join in courses and activities, from watercolour painting, sailing, yoga, dance and music. Having no stresses and lying around and chilling out is the ideal state to feel flirtatious. The courses are all held outside in a beautiful pine-forested bay on the left side of the island and you can stay in traditional stone villas. It's mainly a place for singles and has a very laid-back atmosphere, making it easier for people to meet each other. It's the ideal place to put your flirting skills into action. You wake up to do Tai Chi, and after eating your breakfast outdoors you are already in a very relaxed state to feel much better about yourself than you do at home. You are then more receptive to others. If you have a good body Skyros is a great place to flaunt it by running into the sea wearing just swimming trunks or a bikini. But if you haven't, then the island is ideal for confidence building and you'll be taught to make the most of what you have. Let's face it, romances can start on holiday with people knowing very little about each other and many relationships are based purely on lust!
