That, more or less, is the message after five months of national debate staged by Niace, the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education, on the question \"who should pay for learning?\". This rather predictable conclusion is bound to miff a fair number of those who have put their tuppence worth into the Big Conversation, the title chosen by Niace for this exercise. It is certainly not going to gratify those who persistently lobby for laws to force industry to spend more on training, nor those who are adamant that the state should pick up the tab. Some may detect the whiff of a compromise, an attempt to please everyone and not to aggravate government. Tricky terrain Niace's director, Alan Tuckett, believes that if it doesn't on its own progress the cause of adult learning, the Big Conversation has laid down clear routes in the tricky terrain ahead. \"It shows beyond doubt that there is a clear public value to engaging in adult learning, whether for the economy or for people's own well-being,\" he says. \"However, the general public doesn't regard the provision of adult learning in the way that it regards clinics or hospitals.\" That is the big difference, Tuckett reckons. People who are not habitual users of the health service still see it as a key part of the welfare state that should be funded. \"The benefits of adult learning are clear and manifest to anybody who gets involved and to those who provide it, but not to the general public. Until you've joined in you don't see it as a priority for taxation.\" Is Niace going to have to accept that adult education or learning is not an activity that the mass of the public is prepared to invest in, however much they think it is a good thing? Tuckett draws two conclusions. \"We have to engage in a hearts and minds exercise to win over more people,\" he says. \"And we have to say to politicians: never mind what's easy and popular. The benefits of adult learning are so clear that they have to create conditions where everybody does invest more: individuals, employers and the state.\" It is a fair bet that Lord Leitch will reach the same overall conclusion - everybody must invest more, or at least everyone has got to do better - when he presents his review on skills to the chancellor tomorrow. But he has made it pretty clear that he is not going to venture far down the road towards compelling employers to invest more in training. Niace launched its Big Conversation in May for this year's adult learners' week and took as its starting point \"that adult learning is not an option: it's an economic essential and a key contributor to social cohesion\". \"Now is a crucial time for the future of adult learning,\" declared the letter, which was jointly signed by Niace, the National Union of Students, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (now the University and Colleges Union), the public service union Unison, and the National Federation of Women's Institutes, which kicked it off. \"One million adult learning places are threatened over the next two years and there's already been a drop of 23% of people over 60 learning.\" Two-thirds of the jobs of the next decade will need to be filled by adults, including migrants, older people and women returners, because there will not be enough young people to fill the shoes of those who retire, and these jobs will increasingly demand higher levels of skills. The Big Conversation was then thrown wide open. Niace asked its members and networks nationwide and a wide range of organisations to respond to such key questions as how much adult education should be available within easy reach of where people live, how much they can be expected to cough up for it, and how much of the tab should be picked up by employers and the state. Before the Big Conversation went large, Niace conducted a survey of 6,000 people and asked them the same questions. This provided a reality check. People who have not participated in formal learning since school believed that individuals should pay more for their courses. There was a convincing majority of adults - 75% - who felt that basic skills courses should not be paid for by the taxpayer. Government policy is that adults with literacy and numeracy problems should have free tuition. The people surveyed said that nearly 40% of the cost of basic skills courses should come from the students. Strong reaction Niace was so shocked at the strong reaction against the notion that the taxpayer should pay for basic skills tuition that it ran the survey again with a fresh sample but substituted the word \"government\" for \"taxpayer\". This time, just under 40% said the government should pay the whole cost and only a fifth said it should pay nothing. Undoubtedly, a lot was said in the Big Conversation. A sample of some of the choicer quotes has been swept up in Niace's final report, The Case For Adult Learning, and they cover the whole gamut. \"To gain the essential skills required to function in society should be the free and equal right of every citizen,\" says a skills-for-life tutor working in north London. \"People need to be shown that having poor skills is nothing to be ashamed of, though with it does come responsibility to develop oneself.\" \"I am a firm believer that education is a right, not a privilege, but I also believe that investment in one's own development is twice as valuable as the money invested in it,\" said Denise Burness, head of learning and skills at Haverigg prison, Cumbria. \"If people want to learn yoga, tai chi, belly dancing, upholstering, Chinese cooking, pottery, basket weaving etc, they must pay the full course fee. The age-old argument about single mothers and other low earners who cannot afford to pay does not hold true,\" according to one respondent. \"Unfortunately for this government, education is purely for utilitarian purposes and has no value beyond that,\" said another. \"The government needs to know how important our provision is and how reductions to the service will cost them more than maintaining it,\" said Jenny Harriman, head of Brixham adult and community learning in Devon. \"Without this friendly, doorstep provision the doctors and health service will be coping with more depressed/ill people.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
