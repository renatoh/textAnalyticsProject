Joe Ousalice, 68, had served in the navy for nearly 18 years when he was discharged in 1993 because of a ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces. The former radio operator, who lives in Southampton, served in the Falklands war, did six tours of duty in Northern Ireland, was posted to the Middle East and was seconded for two and a half years to a Nato taskforce. Ousalice was stripped of his long service and good conduct medals and three good conduct badges when he was discharged because of his sexuality. After a historic court settlement in a case brought by Liberty, the human rights organisation, the MoD has apologised and returned Ousalice\u2019s medals. The ministry is establishing a scheme so that others in Ousalice\u2019s situation can get their medals back. Ousalice said: \u201cI should have always been judged on the basis of my exceptional service and not my sexuality. History has shown us that a person\u2019s sexuality has no bearing on how they perform in times of conflict. So many LGBT people were forced out of their wonderful careers and the consequences were devastating.\u201d Ousalice was forced to keep his sexuality a secret while serving in the navy. It was during a court martial, in which he was found guilty of being in bed with another man, a charge he maintains was fabricated, when Ousalice had to disclose his sexuality. \u201cThe navy wasn\u2019t just my job, it was my life. But to do it I had to hide another important part of me, which I did because I loved the navy life so much I didn\u2019t want to give it up. But I shouldn\u2019t have been asked to choose,\u201d Ousalice said. \u201cI was made to feel like I was disgusting and in the end I was hounded out on some trumped up charges, and told that because I was attracted to men my 18 years of service counted for nothing.\u201d Emma Norton, Ousalice\u2019s solicitor and the head of legal casework at Liberty, said: \u201cThe MoD discriminated horribly against LGBT members of the armed forces for decades. They subjected people to degrading and intrusive investigations into their private lives, destroying careers and damaging lives. As we approach the 20th anniversary of the lifting of the ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces, it is important to recognise the impact of this policy on our LGBT veterans.\u201d An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cBack in 1993, because of his sexuality, Mr Ousalice was treated in a way that would not be acceptable today and for that we apologise. \u201cWe accept our policy in respect of serving homosexuals in the military was wrong, discriminatory and unjust to the individuals involved.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
