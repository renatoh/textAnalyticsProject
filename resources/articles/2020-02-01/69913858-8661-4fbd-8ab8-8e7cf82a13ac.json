Evidence of an excellent start to the season is provided by a McIlroy scoring average of 68.5 from nine rounds, two of which were 73s. McIlroy, recently returned as the world No 1, marched to the top of the leaderboard at the WGC Mexico Championship here with a 65. Whereas on Wednesday, McIlroy created shockwaves by vehemently dismissing plans for a breakaway tour, Thursday he successfully returned to his natural domain. McIlroy made a birdie at the 9th, his 18th, from 9ft to take a two-stroke lead over Bubba Watson and Justin Thomas. The highlight of a six-under-par round had come much earlier: at the 11th, his 2nd, he played a glorious four-iron from 274 yards to within 15ft. A converted eagle putt followed. It remains early in the year \u2013 and the event \u2013 but the indications are McIlroy is back to his best. \u201cI\u2019m confident because I am playing well,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless whether I have a 1 or a 2 or a 10 beside my name in the world rankings, I\u2019m comfortable with my game, I\u2019m comfortable with what I\u2019m doing and that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d McIlroy switched putter, back to the one he used in 2019, following last week\u2019s Genesis Invitational. So far, so good on that front. McIlroy said he had received \u201cnice messages\u201d over his Premier League stance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hoping for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just providing my point of view and getting it off my chest. I wasn\u2019t trying to do anything or prove a point or try to get any sort of praise. \u201cI\u2019ve been sick of talking about it for the last few months and I\u2019m happy that everyone knows where I stand.\u201d Tyrrell Hatton, in his first start of the year, signed for a 69. The Englishman has been battling a wrist injury since completing his European Tour season in Dubai in November. \u201cIt\u2019s still not 100% to be perfectly honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a little twinge there but I\u2019m hoping that now I\u2019m back playing, it\u2019ll ease up. It is just going to take time. The recovery was a bit longer than we thought it would be. This week is a good test for it, give myself four competitive rounds and see how I feel at the end of it.\u201d Paul Casey matched Hatton\u2019s score, as did Lee Westwood. Tommy Fleetwood, playing in the company of McIlroy, recovered from a sluggish start to post 70."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
