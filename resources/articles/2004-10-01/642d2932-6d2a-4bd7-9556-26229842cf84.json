A woman and four men in their 20s were held yesterday in west London, Scotland Yard said. Mr Symons, 45, was stabbed in the struggle at his home in Chiswick at 4.30am on Wednesday. His daughters, Harriet, five, and Melissa, three, were asleep upstairs when his wife, Linda Davies, heard a noise and found her husband lying in a pool of blood by the stairs. She saw the front door closing as the killer or killers escaped. He died in hospital; the cause of death was a single stab to the heart. He had given up a lucrative job as an IT consultant to retrain as a science teacher, and began his first job this term at Queens Park community school, in Kilburn, north-west London. The headteacher, Michael Hulme, said: \"We are all very shocked. Robert was a well-liked colleague.\" Ms Davies, 44, a photographer, said her husband had been preparing a Hallowe'en party and his daughters' birthdays. \"I thought we were going to grow old together. Now when the children fall down, I can hear him offering to kiss them better. Our children are so young, I doubt that they will remember him.\" His mother Amyra, 80, whose husband Kenneth died earlier this year, said: \"We are all extremely distressed.\" Mr Symons successfully fought off a burglar at his previous house in Notting Hill a few years ago, a family friend said, adding : \"His mother had begged him never to do the same thing again.\" Detectives found a kitchen knife; tests will try to establish if it was grabbed in the kitchen or brought into the house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
