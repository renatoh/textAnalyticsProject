The producer has assembled a cast of worthies \u2013 Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford, Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Rhiannon Giddens (Carolina Chocolate Drops) and Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) \u2013 to put music to Dylan\u2019s unpublished lyrics. But it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s side project. James in particular is in fine voice, howling the blues on Down on the Bottom and sleazing his way through the woozy Hidee Hidee Ho #11. Lost on the River recalls the spontaneity and sheer love of music-making of the original, but it\u2019s not hamstrung by reverence or caution. Tracks such as Nothing to It tap into the same deep wells of traditional American music from which the Basement Tapes sprouted. \u2022 Bob Dylan\u2019s back pages: the truth behind the Basement Tapes \u2022 Bob Dylan and the Band: The Basement Tapes Complete review \u2013 rickety, strange and utterly timeless"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
