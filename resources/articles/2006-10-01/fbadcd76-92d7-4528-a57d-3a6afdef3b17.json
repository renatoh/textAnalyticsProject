Perhaps the Manchester United defender just feels he needs to be confronted now and again, but he is happy with the return of a little recrimination to the England dressing room now that Steve McClaren is manager. \"If the boss we have now with England sees a problem that has to be rectified,\" Ferdinand reported, \"he'll just come out and say that to the lad straight away.\" It is assumed that the atmosphere was more softly consensual under Sven-Goran Eriksson and the restoration of a \"challenging\" environment is reassuring to Ferdinand. It is what he has come to expect in the Old Trafford dressing rooms, from which he will emerge for tomorrow's Euro 2008 qualifier with Macedonia. The air must tremble permanently there in the wake of all Sir Alex Ferguson's invective. \"The boss at United has achieved great things and he hasn't done that by pussyfooting around people,\" said Ferdinand. \"That's the way I've been brought up. Some players might squirm at being bollocked, but I don't think there's anything better than hearing the manager being honest in front of the lads or even to your face, by yourself. So you know where you went wrong and what you've got to do to improve it.\" It is impossible not to treat these views as a rebuke to Eriksson. Such belated fault-finding also leaves Ferdinand open to ridicule since it was not really so long ago that the Swede was treated as the epitome of mature leadership in which footballers were treated as adults. Harangues, in any case, are not necessarily the answer if the long success at Arsenal of the intense yet quietly spoken Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is any guide. Ferdinand has to be viewed as a player casting around for something different after the disappointments with England. He volunteers the view that the national team will only be esteemed again if it can \"achieve something\" at the Euro 2008 finals. The defender does claim, none the less, that the changes in the England camp have been refreshing. He has a licence to bring the ball out of defence and that liberty should be extended if Ferdinand is one of a trio of centre-backs in a 3-5-2 formation tomorrow. \"I've always been brought up as free-spirit when playing football,\" said the 27-year-old. \"It wasn't really encouraged under the last regime. \"When you play against Portugal you don't see them in a rigid formation. You see players drifting. In the past England teams people have just been put in [set] positions. We have to demand and expect more of each other. I think we were over-cautious in a lot of our play. That's not just in the last World Cup but in previous ones as well. Other teams can throw caution to the wind a little bit but still get good results.\" He testifies to a heightened intensity at England, although he is undecided whether McClaren has created it or whether it is the result of footballers trying to impress him. There is an air of opportunity, even if it is Owen Hargreaves' broken leg that has created a vacancy likely to be filled by Ferdinand's United team-mate Michael Carrick, whom he has know since they were both youngsters at Upton Park. \"He's gone up the ladder of the game from West Ham to Tottenham, where he was one of the most influential players,\" said the defender. \"We [at Manchester United] spoke about him more in our team talks than any other player when he was there. It's good for us that he's come to our team. He'll be good for people like Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Louis Saha and Ryan Giggs because he's got that range of passing.\" Carrick will have chances to pick out Rooney against Macedonia and Ferdinand does not accept that the forward's form has been as poor as has been claimed since his return from injury and suspension. \"Fitness-wise, he's improving,\" the centre-half insisted. \"Benfica was a good game for him because he was played out of position [on United's left wing] but he did what was asked of him in his defensive duties. He had to do a lot of running, which was good. There has been a steady improvement. In time you will see him back at the standard he has set for himself, but I still don't think he has been playing poorly. The goals will come, but there are other things. He puts players through on goal and he attracts people towards him to make space for others.\" If McClaren really has instilled a more adventurous outlook, Rooney will not be the only one aiming to do so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
