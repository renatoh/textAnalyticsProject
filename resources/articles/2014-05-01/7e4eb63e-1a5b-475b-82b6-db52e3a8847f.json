The Ballydoyle trainer is well placed to land Saturday's Lingfield Derby Trial for what would be the fourth time in seven runnings, fielding two horses, the better of which may be Blue Hussar (2.55). He won his only race so far, a seven-furlong maiden at Leopardstown in November, staying on strongly after having only two of his 13 rivals behind him at the turn for home. A son of Montjeu, he should be perfectly comfortable at this sort of distance with some cut in the ground and can make sufficient progress to win what does not seem a hot race. His stablemate, Mekong River, is much more of a known quantity after five races last season and his flop at Saint-Cloud in November suggests he is short of Derby quality. He will be the mount of Joseph O'Brien, which may make some think that he is the stable's first string, but jockey bookings are not a completely reliable guide to such matters and the booking of Ryan Moore is clearly not a negative for Blue Hussar. Sudden Wonder gives Godolphin a fair shot at this prize, having won a valuable pot at the Craven meeting, but Charlie Appleby's string has not fared all that well since then and he looks short enough in the betting. 1.50 Haydock A Grade One winner at Aintree last spring, L'Unique has worked her way back to peak form in the last month and should again go well. The way she has finished her last two races suggests this three miles should be a help. 2.05 Ascot Restraint Of Trade is a fascinating contender and will surely prove better than his present rating in time. He was one of the horses doped with stanozolol by Mahmood al-Zarooni, the trainer who was given an eight-year worldwide ban last year. Restraint Of Trade was banned from racing for six months, along with the other horses involved, but is back in action and will be the first of the doped horses to run in Britain since the story broke. He showed some promise in Dubai earlier this year but may be best watched this time, with the Charlie Appleby yard short of peak form. Hamelin scored on his handicap debut in October when last seen and should appreciate this softer surface. He still looks well treated. 2.20 Lingfield A daughter of Andrew Balding's Oaks winner, Casual Look, Casual Smile is winless but showed excellent form last year, notably when beaten a neck by Taghrooda, who is now Oaks favourite. By Sea The Stars, Casual Smile should be a lot better this year and over this extra distance. 2.40 Ascot Nicky Henderson has a fine record with his Flat runners and seems to have coaxed a bit of improvement from Area Fifty One, judged on his Doncaster win in March. A repeat of that could be enough here, with not all rivals certain to relish some cut underfoot. 3.15 Ascot James Fanshawe won this race four years ago and immediately had it in mind for Ribbons after she made a promising return behind Zurigha at Kempton. A mile might possibly be on the sharp side for her on a sound surface but there will be some give here. 3.30 Haydock Loyaute has been in good form and her third behind Polly Peachum and L'Unique at Cheltenham reads well in the context of what those horses did next. But she has less scope to be ahead of her mark than Dubawi Island, a Venetia Williams runner who makes his handicap debut unbeaten over hurdles after three starts. A winner off 83 on the Flat, he is not bereft of speed and is versatile as to going. 3.50 Ascot This looks a fascinating renewal of the Victoria Cup which should offer clues to many major handicaps later this summer. Glen Moss has improved for his move to David Brown's yard and should go well again with an extra 5lb to carry after his Haydock win. But there may be some value at 16-1 in backing Dont Bother Me to turn the form around, having run fourth that day. Marco Botti's horses have generally been needing their first outing this year and this one in particular seemed likely to benefit from that run. He was seventh in the Jersey Stakes last summer when trained in Ireland and setting the pace but more restrained tactics seem likely to help and he is an interesting handicap prospect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
