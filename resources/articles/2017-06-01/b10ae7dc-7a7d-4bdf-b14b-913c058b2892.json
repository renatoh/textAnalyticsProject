Lead the fallen souls of Cornwall! \u2018Tis the coming of the shadow of death \u2013 and the curse of the black moon. Bang the drums and hear the waves crashing on the shore, Poldark\u2019s back. There was enough going on in this episode to fuel an entire series of any other drama. And yet it all seemed fairly normal because this is just the pace at which things move in Trenwith and Nampara: let\u2019s call it a lively mare\u2019s gallop. At least there was a fiercely happy event at the heart of it all. \u201cI can scarce believe this day has come ...\u201d Me either. Sindy Doll and the Doctor were getting married. The joy on the doctor\u2019s face! It was a wedding that felt almost delayed from last series, and long overdue. This episode did a good job of getting us back up to speed if we had forgotten the drowning of Francis; the long-standing feud between Evil George and Ross; Elizabeth and Ross\u2019s ambiguous night of (coerced?) passion; and Aunt Agatha\u2019s premonitions about a baby who would be coming suspiciously soon. Why, Elizabeth, all this heavy book-lifting and those three-mile walks; anyone would think you were trying to induce the birth. I felt like sending round a vindaloo to speed things up less dangerously. Of course, the long-awaited union of Dr Enys and Caroline Penvenen couldn\u2019t be straightforward. But what a thing to happen on your pudding-fuelled honeymoon \u2013 a message to come and deliver Ross\u2019s illegitimate child (surely?) \u201cSo much for my wedding night ...\u201d How inconvenient. Demelza was the first to spot that this \u201cfall\u201d could hardly be coincidental; she knows the timing\u2019s off. \u201cYou\u2019ll go with Caroline?\u201d That was an extraordinary moment. Demelza couldn\u2019t be certain Ross wouldn\u2019t head to Elizabeth. But somehow he restrained himself and stayed away, while by the light of the black moon the dark-haired Ross-like child was born. \u201cI see the resemblance ...\u201d Do you, Evil George? Are you sure? Ross knew the truth and looked as if he had eaten a wasp throughout most of this episode. It was very upsetting to see the last of Bergerac. What beautiful scenes from John Nettles; no one wanted Uncle Ray to die. I did wonder whether he would be quite so forgiving of Sindy Doll going behind his back to marry Dr Enys. But it made for a poignant scene. And so as one cast member expires (not forgetting Demelza\u2019s annoying father too), others gallop in. And who be this, then? This be Demelza\u2019s brother! (Is it me or are the Cornish accents extremely pronounced this series? Perhaps we\u2019re just out of practice.) And this be Morwenna the governess, for one of the brothers to fall in love with. Other highlights? Geoffrey Charles is shaping up to be an excellent thorn in Evil George\u2019s side. Prudie has a glint in her eye. And Horace the pug did a fine turn at the foot of the bed. It all bodes well. Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor Last series the pewter tankard went nowhere near Jack Farthing who plays Evil George Warleggan and that was a grave error. Farthing\u2019s performance is so spot on that it\u2019s almost easy to overlook, so genuine is our hatred of him. (He always reminds me of George Osborne. Maybe it\u2019s the wavy plastic hair.) He was on top form here. Evil George\u2019s latest missions include sending Geoffrey Charles to boarding school, founding the only bank in Cornwall and returning home from a hard day\u2019s work with an unannounced governess in his carriage. And that\u2019s before he\u2019s taken over Poldark\u2019s now-successful mining business. \u201cThere are a few things I\u2019ve yet to purchase, Wheel Grace being one...\u201d His face when Geoffrey Charles arrived home for his impromptu work experience at the mine was a picture. Long may he sup at the tankard with his dastardly ways. Classic Poldark lines \u201cBlood. Name. Purpose. Fate ... It is coming sooner than we think.\u201d Aunt Agatha does not need tarot cards to come across like a witch. \u201cThat child of yours, cursed under a black moon. No good shall come to him!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t miss your former wedded bliss?\u201d \u201cLike a ruptured spleen.\u201d Well said, Prudie. Keep making those puddings. \u201cBliss is most assuredly Caroline.\u201d Oh Dr Enys, no one but you could get away with a line this cheesy. Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment The first series of Poldark rose to prominence largely thanks to the tabloid-busting qualities of The Torso. In the second series it receded into a rustic overshirt as Aidan Turner appeared to mutter in interviews that he was rather tired of the whole business. Instead of bare chest action this week there was a muscular stress-busting run on the beach. Meanwhile, it\u2019s no secret that Demelza\u2019s two brothers have been bussed in as Replacement Torso Action. (And before anyone complains below the line that this is reverse sexism or whatever: yes, yes, I know.) Next week \u201cRoss Poldark has chosen to sever all ties ...\u201d The baby is christened. Demelza\u2019s younger brother has the dampeners put on his burgeoning crush on Morwenna. There are some bad military shenanigans. Verity cries. And there is a ball, and shooting! Pass the popcorn, I mean pudding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
