Although West Ham\u2019s manager denied that it is a relief to be travelling to Crystal Palace on Saturday, he conceded that it is his responsibility to lift the mood by coaxing improved performances out of players who have looked ill at ease in home matches. West Ham are 18th and the move from Upton Park has been fraught with difficulties, with supporters growing restless at the poor organisation in and around the ground and disappointing results on the pitch. They have not won at the London Stadium since 21 August and there was crowd trouble outside the ground after the recent draw with Middlesbrough. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help the whole situation,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cBut the only way I can change that and influence that is if we start winning games. If we start winning, fans will be less nervous. They will be happy during the game. Part of the frustration from the fans is because we are not winning. \u201cIt is not one thing. I want that to stop, of course. It is West Ham, it is my club. But if I think that I want the fans to be happy, how can I help them? What can I do to make them happy? It is very simple. Start getting points, start to climb up the table and if possible play nice football. That\u2019s my job. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d Bilic refused to blame the stadium for the team\u2019s slow start. \u201cThe stadium is great,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the clubs that changed stadium need time to settle in. It\u2019s a great stadium and we have to win a few games to feel more at home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
