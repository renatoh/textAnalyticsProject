The England forward Maro Itoje was named the breakthrough player while the All Blacks\u2019 Steve Hansen was voted the coach of the year for the fourth time in five years. Hunter, who led England to a 12-10 victory over Ireland on Sunday, has been a stabilising figure at No8 for her country with many of her team-mates away on the sevens circuit. Barrett has added a new dimension to New Zealand\u2019s attacking game since taking over as first-choice fly-half, collecting the award ahead of three English contenders \u2013 Billy Vunipola, Owen Farrell and Itoje \u2013 plus fellow Kiwi Dane Coles and Ireland\u2019s Jamie Heaslip. It is the fifth year in a row an All Black player has lifted the top prize, with Dan Carter, Kieran Read and Brodie Retallick all recent winners. Hansen took the coaching accolade ahead of England\u2019s Eddie Jones and Fiji\u2019s Olympic gold medal-winning sevens coach Ben Ryan, with New Zealand also voted team of the year. Ireland\u2019s Syd Millar received the Vernon Pugh award for distinguished service. England have named a virtually unchanged squad of 33 for Saturday\u2019s game against Fiji, with only Sale\u2019s Josh Beaumont not reporting back to Bagshot training.
