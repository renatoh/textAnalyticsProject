The report by the Commons home affairs select committee says that the effort to reduce knife crime has to tackle its causes, such as a lack of faith that the police and parents can protect young people. It says that the proportion of young people who use knives is small but the recent increase in knife violence relates to escalating street violence between groups of young people in the poorer areas of large cities. The report also warns that prison sentences are proving an ineffective long-term solution to violent crime and the wholesale use of metal detectors at schools may make pupils feel less safe. The Commons inquiry confirms that more than a third of all murders in England and Wales are committed using a knife, with 270 fatal stabbings out of 763 homicides recorded in 2007-08. This is the highest number of murders involving a knife since the homicide index was established in 1977. The MPs say that hospital accident and emergency figures show that serious stab wounds are becoming more common. Their report says that a \"public health approach\" should be adopted to prevent violence in the long term, including early intervention with those most at risk of deprivation, those who lack family support and those exposed to violence at home. Most knife crime victims and perpetrators are men in their late teens and early 20s. The MPs agree it is difficult to estimate how many young people are regularly carrying a knife, with some surveys reporting about 3% to 4%, but they say there are fears that it is becoming \"normal\" in some deprived urban areas in big cities. \"Most young people who carry knives say they do so for 'protection'; status and peer pressure are also factors. This perceived need for protection is compounded by the sense, reinforced by media coverage of stabbings, that everyone else is carrying a weapon, as well as experience of victimisation,\" says the report, adding that this is fuelling a spiralling \"arms race\". The MPs say the most potent deterrent is the fear of getting caught, so they back the continued use of stop and search campaigns. They also support the use of prison sentences for those who carry knives but add that high reoffending rates make them ineffective as a long-term solution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
