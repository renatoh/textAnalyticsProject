Tesco is to launch a new Clubcard squarely aimed at getting big-spending householders back into its stores at least twice a month \u2013 with the promise of a 10% discount. From 8 November, the chain will start signing up customers to its new Clubcard Plus programme. Agree to pay its \u00a37.99 monthly fee, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with the 10% discount on two shops of up to \u00a3200 each. On the face of it, a discount of \u00a320-\u00a340 for an \u00a38 outlay looks like a great deal. However, the discount only applies in store, not to online orders. You only get two bites of the cherry each month \u2013 so if you use it one week on a \u00a340 shop, then two weeks later on a \u00a330 shop, you will get just \u00a37 off in total. Forget to use it at all, and you still pay the \u00a37.99 fee. The move is arguably the biggest change yet to the Clubcard scheme, which was launched in 1995 and now has more than 19 million users. Almost every other supermarket has launched loyalty cards since, although critics say they are less and less worthwhile (see below). Shoppers who want Clubcard Plus will need to have a smartphone to download the new special app, which they will have to present at the checkout to gain the discount. For Tesco customers who don\u2019t want to sign up to the app, the existing free Clubcard rewards scheme will continue to operate as it does now, the store says. Shoppers will, in effect, want to pre-plan their big monthly purchases to use the \u201cdiscount\u201d to best effect. The monthly offer begins when you sign up, so if that\u2019s on 8 November, it will renew on the eighth of each month \u2013 until you cancel. You are not locked into a contract and can cancel at any time. Tesco is very clear that users will not be able to apply the discount retrospectively. The scheme, which has been likened to Amazon Prime, is also similar to a \u00a310 a month Marks &amp; Spencer deal launched in 2009. That offers its credit card customers \u00a340 M&amp;S vouchers a year, 48 hot drink vouchers, and triple rewards vouchers that equate to 9% cashback. There are some key exclusions to the new Tesco programme, with all fuel purchases at Tesco forecourts being the most notable. Spending on lottery tickets, gift vouchers, tobacco products, baby formula milk and in Tesco caf\u00e9s are all excluded. Significantly, wine and other booze are included in the deal \u2013 except when the store offers its periodic \u201c25% off six bottles\u201d offers. Purchases of electrical items, such as microwaves and blenders, are also excluded. But shoppers also get 10% off all its own-brand F&amp;F clothing, Fred &amp; Flo nappies and Tesco Pet items \u2013 all the time \u2013 not just at the elected two \u201cdiscount\u201d outings. Tesco Mobile customers get a free doubling of their data allowance, which is worth around \u00a31.50 a month, for up to one mobile account per Clubcard Plus-holding household. Plus holders will have the option to apply for a Tesco Bank credit card, with no foreign exchange fees on purchases abroad, when it opens for applications from next year, although there are plenty of other cards out there that offer that. Alessandra Bellini, Tesco\u2019s chief customer officer, said the package had been launched in time for customers to save money on their Christmas shopping, with the average UK family spending around twice their usual budget for groceries in December. She claims some will save as much as \u00a3400 a year, even after they have paid the \u00a395.88 a year in monthly payments. So is it a good deal? Clearly, if your household regularly spends \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a couple of times a month in a Tesco store this is a no-brainer \u2013 assuming you plan to continue shopping at Tesco. Even if you don\u2019t, you can cancel at any time. However, if you only shop online \u2013 and are not prepared to start pushing a trolley around the aisles again, or make regular, smaller shops, then it\u2019s unlikely to be worth the \u00a396 annual fee. Anika Newjoto of the loyalty points site Shopperpoints.co.uk says the scheme appears stuck in the days when a family bought all their food in one big weekly shop. \u201cThis feels like a mistake from Tesco. The trend now is towards doing smaller shopping trips for fresher food,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is possible that this could breed resentment among people who visit Tesco every few days \u2013 for example pensioners trying to survive week-to-week. They will know those people who, over a month, spend less in total than they do \u2013 but are getting a better deal. Some big-spending online shoppers will also feel particularly aggrieved.\u201d Tesco will begin emailing existing Clubcard members about the new scheme on Monday. If you\u2019re not already a Clubcard member, you can sign up online. Supermarket loyalty schemes rated Boots Advantage What it offers: Four points for every \u00a31 spent, worth 4p This is one of the best schemes in terms of points per pound. You usually get four points for every \u00a31 you spend, with each point worth 1p to spend on Boots products (both in store and online). So 199 points will pay for a product priced at \u00a31.99. Some categories of people, such as those who are pregnant, have young children or are over 60, can sign up for schemes giving them 10 points for every \u00a31 spent on some products. The number of points collected can vary \u2013 so for Boots Opticians and Boots Hearingcare, you only get one point for every \u00a31 spent. Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Co-op Membership What it offers: No points, but 5% off own-brand items Members pay \u00a31 to join, then if they buy own-brand Co-op goods are awarded 5% of what they spend into their Co-op Membership account. They can then spend it on most things \u2013 not just Co-op own-brand goods. Effectively, you get \u00a31 back for every \u00a320 you spend on branded food. Members also see 1% of the money they spend going to local causes in their community. Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons More What it offers: \u00a35 voucher for every \u00a31,000 spent (fewer points for fuel) Like Sainsbury\u2019s, the loyalty card effectively gives you \u00a35 for every \u00a31,000 spent, but unlike the Nectar scheme, the points can only be spent in the store itself. App users receive targeted points offers. The store is great value, often beating Aldi and Lidl on price. But the More card is less of a winner. Rating: \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Nectar What it offers: 0.5p for each \u00a31 spent in store and petrol stations Not the most generous scheme \u2013 shoppers earn one Nectar point for each \u00a31 spent, which is worth 0.5p when spent in store. So after spending \u00a31,000 in Sainsbury\u2019s, you get 1,000 points, worth just \u00a35. One benefit is that Nectar is not just Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 shoppers can collect and spend points at other retailers such as Argos and Esso, although Homebase dropped out. Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose MyWaitrose What it offers: Free newspapers, coffees and other discounts No points, but a selection of freebies instead. Among the most popular is the free hot drink if you make a purchase \u2013 but you have to bring a reusable cup. The newspaper deal is particularly generous: if you spend more than \u00a310 in store, the cost of the paper is refunded \u2013 which means \u00a33.20 if you\u2019re buying the Guardian there today. Cardholders also get 20% off fish on Fridays. If you were to buy the Guardian every Saturday at Waitrose and get the free coffee, it\u2019s worth about \u00a3270 a year on a \u00a3520 spend, which is extraordinary value. Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2019 to clarify that the 10% Tesco Clubcard Plus discount does not apply to a single shop costing \u00a3200-\u00a3400 each month"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
