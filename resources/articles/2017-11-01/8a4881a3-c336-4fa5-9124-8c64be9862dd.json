Swansea have lost six of their last seven Premier League games, fuelling unrest among fans who turned on the board and some of the players during the previous home game, a 1-0 defeat against Brighton. Clement acknowledged supporters \u201chave every right to show their frustration\u201d with poor performances but he has asked them to back the team and wait until the final whistle to voice any criticism. \u201cThat would be a hope of mine, that they would do that,\u201d Swansea\u2019s manager said. \u201cWhat would be difficult is that after 10 minutes, if there\u2019s a misplaced pass, and they\u2019re on to it, that would be hard for the players. \u201cSo hopefully the fans can keep their frustrations until maybe later if they\u2019ve seen a performance that they\u2019re not happy with. They have every right to show their frustration but I also hope they want to help the team. Hopefully, we will start well.\u201d With Clement under pressure, the players underperforming, fans still angry with the takeover last year and the supporters\u2019 trust looking for a third chairman in the space of a fortnight, there is disharmony at all levels at Swansea. In many respects it feels like a repeat of this time last season, when the mood was mutinous and Swansea appeared doomed. \u201cI spoke to Leon [Britton, the player-coach] about [last season] and he described it as being 10 times worse but I think he meant performances because the goals were falling in,\u201d Clement said. \u201cThere were three to four goals going in and I think that was a particularly difficult time. We aren\u2019t quite at that level yet where we\u2019re getting absolutely hammered but at the same time we know we\u2019re not playing well. \u201cWe have to stick at it. It\u2019s easier to do it if you stick together because you know that everyone\u2019s got each other\u2019s backs. I heard there\u2019s talk of protests and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right time for it. I think it\u2019s a time to pull together. I\u2019m sure that everyone wants the same thing here. I know me and the players do, and the owner does and the chairman does, but we want to start playing better and get some good results. I believe the fans want that as well, and the best chance we\u2019ve got is to all come together and work in the same direction.\u201d It is a measure of how concerned Clement is about the atmosphere that he admitted it could come into his thinking when he picks his team. \u201cWe\u2019ve had these discussions the last couple of days. We are not sure what sort of atmosphere will develop in the game. Hopefully we will start well and we can move forward with good momentum but it could potentially be a difficult atmosphere. Who are the personalities and characters? Who has got the experience to be able to deal with that sort of pressure? So it is a consideration.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
