Magistrate Peter Law was deported on Sunday afternoon and when the chief magistrate, Geoffrey Eames AM QC, tried to intervene by issuing an injunction to stop the deportation he had his visa cancelled and was barred from entering Nauru. Immigration minister Scott Morrison said he was confident the sackings were over internal issues rather than the pair's treatment of asylum seekers, though Eames has said it played a role in the events of the weekend. \"How or why this has occurred in Nauru isn't 100% clear yet,\" Morrison told Macquarie radio on Monday. \"But my best understanding at the moment is that it has nothing to do with how he was dealing with any asylum cases that are before him.\" Earlier, Nauru\u2019s justice minister, David Adeang, had declared two Nauru residents \u2013 one an Australian citizen, the other a Fijian citizen \u2013 prohibited immigrants and gave them a week to leave the country. The two men appealed to the courts and Law had granted an interim injunction against their deportation. The cases were due to come before the courts on Monday. \"The timing of this makes it very obvious in my mind what this is all about,\" Law said. In a statement to the ABC, Eames agreed. \"[The actions against Law are] politically motivated, designed to have the decisions overturned by a new magistrate and amounted to an abuse of the rule of law,\" Eames said. Law accused Nauru's president, Baron Waqa, of acting in contempt of court and said he was jostled and pushed by his arresting officer. \"It was a very comprehensive injunction ... It's hard to imagine why it was ignored,\" Law said. Both men believe the move was politically motivated. The Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the deportation and visa cancellation. \u201cThe Australian government is seeking clarification of the facts surrounding the issues,\u201d it said. Nauru is used as an offshore processing centre for asylum seekers who try to come to Australia by boat and more than 100 of them were due to face court over riots at a detention centre last July. It is not clear how the trials are going to proceed, if at all. Law was reportedly deported on the grounds of misconduct but Eames said Laws denied the accusations and they were not consistent with his experience of him. \u201cThese events are unprecedented,\u201d Eames said. \u201cI consider that it is my duty to uphold the rule of law and the principle of judicial independence.\u201d He added: \u201cThose principles are vital to democracy.\u201d The deportation and visa cancellations come after the Nauru government increased journalist visas from $200 to $8,000. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2014. An earlier version said the two men for whom Laws had granted an interim injunction against deportation were asylum seekers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
