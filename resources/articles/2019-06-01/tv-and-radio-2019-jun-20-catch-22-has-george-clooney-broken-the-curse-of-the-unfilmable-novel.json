In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Good Omens \u2013 functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary. I have to admit that I didn\u2019t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris; as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22\u2019s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls\u2019 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best. A similar fate of smug, too wacky mediocrity seemed inevitable. And yet somehow they have pulled it off. The Catch-22 series is successful in almost every way. It is beautifully shot, thoughtfully written and incredibly well acted. It takes plenty of liberties with Joseph Heller\u2019s book \u2013 there are approximately 25 fewer characters, almost no flashbacks and the ending is entirely different \u2013 but, having seen the series, I have come to the conclusion that these changes are exactly what make it sing. I\u2019ll try to stay clear of spoiler territory, but the biggest decision made by the film-makers was to break the book apart and put it back together in the right order. The book hops about all over the place, leaping from viewpoint to viewpoint and back and forth through time. It\u2019s a terrific sleight-of-hand \u2013 when Heller decides to fill in the blanks caused by this literary restlessness, it comes as a punch in the guts \u2013 but it would have made for an incredibly annoying TV show. Instead, the series takes its time to wear down its protagonist, bombardier John Yossarian (Christopher Abbott). His downfall is parcelled out carefully along the way, and each new attempt to escape his fate brings about new and awful consequences. By the time he is finally broken, it has a feeling of inevitability that wasn\u2019t present in the novel. It also reinforces the notion that Yossarian is a classic antihero, rather than a sane innocent trapped in a world of madness. Every time he tries to wriggle free of his commitments, he causes something terrible to happen to someone else. When this happened in the book, everything was rationalised through prose. Without that safety net, Yossarian quite often just comes off as a dick. Perversely, this makes him a little easier to understand. Speaking of prose, another smart decision was to avoid Heller\u2019s tone as often as possible. The book is a smashed Rubik\u2019s cube, full of repetition, circular reasoning and busted logic. All the characters are trapped by their own thought patterns, which is fun to read but \u2013 as anyone who has watched every episode of the tonally similar W1A can attest \u2013 can be brutal to sit through. It still happens here and there, so the doctor\u2019s explanation of insanity is thankfully still intact, but it isn\u2019t quite as punishing. Stripping the plot back and rebuilding it in the shape of a classic drama feels like a something of a masterstroke. Especially compared with Good Omens, which suffered enormously from how faithful it was to the book. I don\u2019t know anyone, aside from those falling within the very highest percentile of Terry Pratchett fandom, who didn\u2019t groan in despair when Amazon\u2019s adaptation opened with several minutes of arch narration over what seemed to be a deliberate copy of QI\u2019s opening titles. Catch-22, less in thrall to its fans, is much more confident in its ability to take on a new shape, and this makes it far easier to watch. It also feels more open-ended, as if Hulu has already entertained the idea of lengthening the series out beyond the source material. Let\u2019s hope that the failure of the last two Handmaid\u2019s Tale seasons is enough to put them off. However, if this was always intended to be a finite six-episode retelling, then Catch-22 might just go down as the first time that anyone has successfully filmed an unfilmable novel. Catch-22 airs Thursdays, 9pm on Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
