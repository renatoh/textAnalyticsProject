Justin Smith says: While Facebook has been growing at around 300,000 to 400,000 active users per day for most of the fourth quarter (based on our estimations), its growth rate seems to have significantly increased in recent weeks to 600,000 or perhaps even 700,000 new users each day. At roughly 7 users per second, it could reach 200 million users in March. The first 100 million took more than 8 years, to the end of August this year, while the second could take less than 8 months [corrected from June]. Although Facebook already has lots of users in the US and the UK, for example, there are still plenty of untapped markets, especially in countries that don't use English. Whether it's a profitable expansion is another matter, of course. The latest official stats are in the Facebook Press Room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
