I doubt the curators of this project have been feeling quite themselves either, judging by the dismal barrage of pseudo theory with which they inundate this slender show. The purpose of the exhibition, we are told, is \"to extend the contemporary enquiry around architectural space into a psychological and emotional exploration of the human interface with its environment\". Large print copies of this nonsense are also available. You can also find the cliche-free version on a blank sheet of paper. Such overwrought concept-mongering is a pity because, after interfacing with the environment for a while, the pictures become an absorbing exercise in the aesthetics of the underground car park. A trio of female photographers, Rut Blees Luxemburg, Effie Paleologou and Sophy Rickett, use long exposures to justify their even lengthier critical arguments. What you see is a series of orangey nocturnes in which the city is a nightmare hazard zone of puddle-filled potholes and piss-streaked subways. Like a small dog with a full bladder, Rickett is irresistibly drawn to lamp-posts. Her previous Women Pissing series was precisely what it described, but her present multi-panel contribution, Wested Interchange, seems to be more about meditation than micturition. A lone woman squats, lotus-like, on a darkened sportsfield. Luxemburg \"finds pleasure in the incontinence of puddle\". Puddles, incontinent or otherwise, figure largely in her work, either pitted with raindrops or amplified into alien lakes that sprawl over mysterious, asphalt landscapes. Such theatrically staged, austerely lit compositions are starkly opposed to Paleologou's impassive surveillance-camera shots. Commuters scuttle around the intimidating, sodium-lit infrastructure of the city, looking haunted and harassed, as if half-aware that an art-photographer is pursuing them. These are carefully wrought, technically accomplished images. But wrapping a monotonous selection of Stygian, shadowy corners in a few ill-digested phrases from Woolf produces a concept that will only appeal to mugs or muggers. Until October 6.
