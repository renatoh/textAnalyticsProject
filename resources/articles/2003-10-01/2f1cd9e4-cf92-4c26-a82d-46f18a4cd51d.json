An attempt in March to alter the single-sex status of Oxford's last women-only college, St Hilda's, fell just one vote short of the two-thirds majority required on the governing body. Students, worried that the college authorities may overrule student opinion and try again, have launched a \"purple ribbon campaign\" to prevent another attempt. The campaign will also aim to preserve the three women's colleges in Cambridge - Newnham, New Hall and Lucy Cavendish, which caters for mature students. Catherine Wallis, Oxford University students' union women's officer, said: \"Despite the good work undertaken by our universities, there is still much to be done before we can claim full equality of the sexes. We still need colleges dedicated to the active promotion of women's education, which can prioritise women's requirements, potential and achievement. \"Many women prefer a mixed environment, others feel more empowered in an all-female space; so that everyone can have the chance to choose the environment in which they'll flourish, it's essential to keep all-women colleges. We want Oxford and Cambridge universities to be able to select students only on the basis of academic merit, which means the continued existence of women's colleges.\" The move to change the composition of St Hilda's, founded as a women's college in 1893, split the dons and students. A \"lilac for ladies\" campaign to keep the status quo held a protest picnic on the college lawn - provoking an anti-lilac demo from students wearing red. The college, which is usually low down the Norrington table of degree results in Oxford, hoped to attract more university funding for academic posts if these were open to men as well as women. It has been the only women's college in Oxford since Somerville admitted men in 1994 - primarily in an effort to attract better women candidates. Jo Read, Cambridge University students' union women's officer said: \"The continued existence of women's colleges not only represents a women's issue, but also an access issue. \"Without these colleges, many women would be unable to attend Oxbridge universities, and this would prove to be a disastrous blow upon university and students' union access schemes to widen applications to Oxbridge. \"Women's colleges enabled women to start attending university in this country, and only their continued existence can ensure that all women can continue to attend the university of their choice.\" The campaign encourages all members of Oxford and Cambridge to show their support of the women who choose to attend women's colleges. After the first week of petitioning, thousands of signatures have been collected, and the campaign will now begin to publicise the importance of women's colleges throughout the two universities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
