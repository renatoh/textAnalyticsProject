This comprehensive guide details the best places to eat and stay in Scotland, from small, homely coffee bars to the finest restaurants and hotels. According to the authors, culinary experimentation is widespread north of the border. For example, Atholl House Hotel on the Isle of Skye serves up Scottish food with a Caribbean influence, and Igg's restaurant brings 'Spanish sunshine to Edinburgh' with a selection of tapas and heartier fare. If you crave pea and ham soup, however, there are plenty of traditional places to choose from. The second edition has a fold-out map and more than 70 new entries for travellers to sample. Every year Macallan Whisky sponsor a Taste of Scotland award to select the best of the best. This year's overall winner is the Kinloch House in Blairgowrie. Crammed with visitor attractions and a local product guide, it's an essential read for tourists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
