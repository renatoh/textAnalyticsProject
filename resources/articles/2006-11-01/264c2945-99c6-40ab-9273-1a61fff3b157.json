It's quite annoying. I was down in London when I did it and I didn't realise it was broken, so I came all the way back up to Newcastle with my bags and my bike and everything. I had to go to the hospital. I might have to have an operation on it because it's snapped at the bottom and they might need to pin it to get it to stop moving around. It's bad timing because we've just started sculpture and I can't use one of my hands, so I don't know how successful I'm going to be at this bit of the course. I might have to get some help with some of it. It will be like being a big, famous artist - I'll just do the drawings and get other people to do the work. It's a really great course, really fantastic. At the moment, we're getting to know the main departments so I've done little courses on painting and printing, and in the last four weeks up to Christmas we're doing sculpture. Printing was really good. It was completely broad, so we could just do what we wanted. I used latex instead of paper and it was really exciting. Painting was a bit more constrained. It was an investigation into colour and I found it harder. I do pay attention to colour but to only look at colour was new. It was quite interesting, a different approach. Every day is really busy. There's always something to do and always someone to hang out with. I've benefited from being in the studio. You can just wander around, be nosy, see what people are working on. It's helped with getting to know people, I think. My flatmates who are doing lectures are limited in how much wandering around they can do! Everyone in my department is really friendly. I've got to know second years, third years, fourth years. You can talk to anyone. It's quite free. You're supposed to be in the studio most of the week, but you could come in and work really hard from 9am until 7pm one day, and then not come in the next day. I work harder than some people, I suppose, but not that hard. I seem to spend most of the day chatting to people and drinking cups of tea. On Mondays we have history of art lectures. We've just done our first essays for that and I'm really enjoying it. On Fridays we have something called life art, which involves going out and visiting artists, or looking behind the scenes at galleries. The rest of the time you're in the studio. For the first few weeks here I was going out every night, just because I wanted to meet people. But I got a bit tired from doing that so now I go out maybe every other night. The people in my flat are really nice and we get on really well but I haven't been in that much. I'm in the studio until five-ish and then I go on somewhere else with people on the course. I mainly go to pubs or round to other people's houses. I like clubbing, but I haven't found anywhere in Newcastle that I really like yet. I'm not that into the kind of music they play here. And it's really expensive to go out at the weekend. Meanwhile... Zuleyma Bennett is studying American studies at Hull University Zuleyma says she's had lots to do this term. So much so, she's rarely in her room - unless she's ill. Laura Bruce is studying media studies and advertising at Chester University Laura has been keeping on top of her work - pretty much. Last weekend, she rewarded herself with a trip to Manchester, and then to London to catch up with a friend from home and let her hair down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
