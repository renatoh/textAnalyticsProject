Fans duly fell over themselves to invite him to their evening meal, just as the west London MC, who has not been undersupplied with confidence, knew they would. More telling proof of his stature, though, comes at the first of two officially sold out (unofficially, there\u2019s room at the back) Alexandra Palace sets. Already a force in grime, Tracey \u2013 born Ch\u00e9 Wolton Grant \u2013 has spent 2019 diversifying and going mainstream with garage track Ladbroke Grove, an irresistibly hooky Top 3 single that has just marked its 36th week in the charts. Three more songs recently reached the Top 40 and his self-titled debut album hit No 3. Accordingly, tonight\u2019s crowd is comprised not just of old hands who were there in 2015, when his quickfire, Skepta-inspired flow began attracting attention, but of suburban teenagers who came onboard this year. It\u2019s for both groups that Tracey has \u201cspent all my money\u201d, turning a rap set into a sensory binge. There are acid trip graphics, a spoof 1950s BBC information film, pole dancers and even some minor pyrotechnics. A visitor identified as \u201cmy jeweller\u201d comes on stage to present a bulky pendant to Tracey, with \u201cLadbroke Grove\u201d spelled out in diamonds. He hands it over with a reverence that the rapper does nothing to discourage. Meanwhile, sardonic ads play on the overhead screen, offering an \u201cexclusive golden goat\u201d for just \u00a369.99. Should you want to place an order, a real phone number is displayed; disappointingly, it goes to an anonymous voicemail when rung. Surely the astute Tracey could have had it connect instead with a stream of his new single, Kiss and Tell, a collaboration with Skepta, who\u2019s here tonight. Performed live, it is a lusty terrace chant, with both MCs shouting the chorus, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t kiss and tell, nah!\u201d. The goat advert\u2019s tagline reads \u201c24 karat solid greatness\u201d \u2013 a typically assured declaration that Tracey pulls off because it\u2019s hard to think of many other British MCs who move so fluidly between grime, trap, drill, country and pop. But don\u2019t think he doesn\u2019t appreciate the success his talent has brought. \u201cI\u2019ve put a lot of effort into the show, and let me tell you, I feel like I\u2019ve hit the jackpot tonight,\u201d he says, gearing up for a gallop through the album track Jackpot. Yet despite the show of gratitude, this gig has the feel of a young artist announcing his candidacy for the title of Best UK Rapper. Cocksureness floods his performance. It\u2019s in his swagger as he roams the stage-in-the-round, giving all four sides an equal share of him; it\u2019s there when he \u2013 an avowed non-singer \u2013 bracingly sings part of the pop bop Wifey Riddim 3. It keeps him from relinquishing his top dog position, too, when sharing the stage with the more famous Dave, who turns up to exchange verses on Thiago Silva. The Streatham MC\u2019s unannounced appearance induces screams but Tracey cranks up his energy-setting to 11 and outdoes him in spitting the tongue-twisting rhymes, which compare his greatness to that of the Brazilian defender Silva. You might even admit that his iffy stab at country-grime, Country Star \u2013 augmented tonight by a live guitarist \u2013 is charming rather than silly. That\u2019s his self-belief at work, and it will stand him in good stead as he continues his upward trajectory. \u2022At Capital\u2019s Jingle Bell Ball, O2 Arena, London, on 8 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
