Top stories \u201cPrivacy is a complete illusion,\u201d says Erin Quinn, a Brisbane woman who discovered this week she had been caught up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Quinn was one of 311,127 Australians who had her Facebook data harvested. Facebook contacted Quinn on Monday to warn her that her likes, public profile, city of residence and date of birth were likely to have been taken. She is angry that her data could have been used for an underhanded strategy to manipulate voters. \u201cI\u2019d never agree to that,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cYou accept that when you sign up to these things you are giving away your data, you accept that to a certain extent \u2026 But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I agree that they should be able to know who I am and what I\u2019m doing all the time.\u201d In the US, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, revealed during his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill that his own data had been handed to Cambridge Analytica. He faced pointed questions about the tech giant\u2019s ability to track its users\u2019 movements, shopping habits and browsing histories and was at one stage compared to J Edgar Hoover. When asked: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Zuckerberg gave one of many evasive responses: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d Donald Trump has told Russia to get ready for US missiles to be fired at Syria as tensions between the two superpowers escalate. A standoff over a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus on Saturday has spiralled into the most dangerous confrontation between the two nuclear-armed powers since the height of the cold war, driven by Vladimir Putin\u2019s uncompromising backing for the Assad regime in Damascus and the US president\u2019s volatility. \u201cRussia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,\u201d the US president tweeted. \u201cGet ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and \u2018smart!\u2019 You shouldn\u2019t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\u201d The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called for calm. \u201cWe do not participate in Twitter diplomacy,\u201d Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is investing $150m to drive emissions reduction in some of Australia\u2019s biggest airports, ports and electricity infrastructure assets. The corporation has invested in an infrastructure fund for the first time and is using that investment to target emissions reduction at Melbourne and Brisbane airports, Sydney\u2019s Port Botany, the Port of Brisbane and Ausgrid. It estimates that a 5% improvement in emissions from those assets would be equivalent to removing 14,775 cars from the road each year. The clean energy financier said reduction initiatives that would be pursued could include installing on-site solar panels and battery storage solutions, and converting to electric vehicles. Wild-caught Queensland prawns, bugs and scallops are off the menu, according to conservationists warning about unsustainable fishing practices. The shellfish varieties have all been downgraded to a red rating in the latest sustainable seafood guide published by the Australian Marine Conservation Society. The society now ranks the trio alongside a suite of other east coast seafood options considered unsustainable. Farmed Queensland prawns are listed as a green \u201cbetter choice\u201d. Sport Sixty-nine per cent of Commonwealth nations criminalise many of their own LGBTI citizens \u2013 37 of 53 countries. That\u2019s the affronting statistic that greets visitors to the Gold Coast\u2019s Rise bar and club, which, for the duration of the Games, has been turned into Pride House \u2013 a safe space for LGBTI athletes and the fans and community that form around the 11-day event on the Gold Coast. Australian field athletes have rarely been the nation\u2019s sporting standard bearers, but unexpected gold medals in the high jump and javelin at Carrara Stadium helped the athletics team pick up where the record-breaking swimmers left off. Thinking time The NSW government is close to deciding who will run one of most ambitious environmental projects that have come out of the Murray-Darling basin plan. If successful, the rehabilitation of the Nimmie-Caira property could result in the restoration of the largest wetlands on the Murrumbidgee river. It would create a sanctuary for birds, extend vital wetland habitats and preserve an area rich in Aboriginal cultural heritage \u2013 all under private-sector ownership. But Anne Davies uncovers plenty of scepticism about the outcome of this scheme, which has already cost $180m, and even speculation that much of the 84,000-hectare property is to be turned into an irrigated cotton farm. In the past 30 years the workforce has undergone dramatic changes as blue-collar jobs decline and service industry work booms. This brings wage equality challenges, writes Greg Jericho, especially as many blue-collar sectors had strong collective bargaining agreements protecting pay and conditions. The IMF is concerned about transitioning middle-skill workers out of jobs at risk from automation. It says wage inequality is likely but not unavoidable, and argues thaet governments should not try to prevent the growth of the services sector or protect traditional blue-collar industries but instead aim to raise productivity across all sectors. Wild Wild Country is an absorbing six-part Netflix documentary that covers the rise and fall of the notorious Rajneeshpuram cult more extensively than any show before it, Sam Wollaston writes. \u201cWhat did go on? Ha \u2013 what didn\u2019t go on, more like. It wasn\u2019t just about a bunch of blissed-out, brainwashed hippies waving their arms in the air and shagging whomever they fancied, whenever and wherever, while their neighbours \u2013 the God-fearing folks of Antelope \u2013 cursed them and waved their stars and stripes from over the fence. There is more to this story than that.\u201d Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald has more on a large wharf in Vanuatu funded by Beijing that is big enough to allow warships to dock alongside it, raising fears among locals and defence experts that it could be used as a Chinese naval military base. Almost half of WA\u2019s homeless population have been attacked or beaten while living on the streets, the West Australian reports. And the ABC reports that a \u201csinglet ban\u201d by some Queensland surf clubs couild be discriminatory. Coming up The former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer will hand over his rifle to the Museum of Australian Democracy. It was one of the first firearms to be handed in for registration under the national firearms agreement in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre. Twenty-four medal events will be run today at the Commonwealth Games in track and field, beach volleyball, mountain bike cycling, diving, rhythmic gymnastics, lawn bowls, women\u2019s shooting, and wrestling.
