After six seasons, four trophies, three runners-up medals \u2013 and a couple of years as Klopp\u2019s next-door neighbour \u2013 it was time for Lallana, consistently heralded by the Liverpool manager as one of the most important players of his reign, to move on. \u201cAfter I had those couple of days where I realised it was going to be my last season at Liverpool, I made sure I treated every day, every training session like it was my last,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoyed the last six, seven, eight months as much as I did any year while I was at the club.\u201d He had, he explains, gone into Klopp\u2019s office half-expecting confirmation his contract would not be renewed and, despite the \u201cinitial feeling of rejection\u201d, listening to Lallana discuss his first months at Brighton, it is clear he is enthused by the project at play, referencing how well the club is run as he discusses the sales pitch he gave Danny Welbeck, who could make his debut against West Brom on Monday. \u201cWe were speaking and it got to a point where I felt I couldn\u2019t message him any more \u2026 but it all came from a good place. I just thought it would be the perfect setup for Welbz. Meeting new people and forming new relationships with teammates, with colleagues is so refreshing and something I think I needed. It\u2019s been absolutely fantastic.\u201d After a stop-start final few seasons at Liverpool, Lallana has played in every Premier League game for Brighton this campaign and if he features against West Brom it will be the first time he has been involved in six successive top-flight games since 2016-17. Graham Potter is managing his workload \u2013 \u201cI maybe do 80% of the session one day, then 100% the next\u201d \u2013 and regular dialogue between Lallana and the Brighton manager has helped the former England midfielder build a tailor-made training programme and get into a groove. \u201cThe manager has said I\u2019m here for three years, not three months, so it was important I didn\u2019t want to do everything and take part in every session and do more. That\u2019s probably an area of my game I needed to improve on. It\u2019s not always about the amount you do; it\u2019s about the quality. \u201cWhen you get rhythm in any walk of life, you start doing things without even thinking about it. I won\u2019t be fighting to do well, fighting to prove myself in that short period, fighting to get back in the team or fighting to make the squad. Which was happening at Liverpool because I had so many setbacks. \u201cI\u2019ve had it before when you put big pressure on yourself to be at a certain level and you\u2019re just fighting it. I am trying to be relaxed. There are signs there that you see as a player that you know it is coming and you are going in the right direction. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d He accepts Liverpool and Brighton share different goals \u2013 one striving for successive titles, the other to improve on a 15th-placed finish \u2013 but Lallana is not lacking motivation. \u201cI would have hung my boots up if I wanted to keep winning titles; I don\u2019t think I would have had the opportunity to go into a team that\u2019s going to win Premier Leagues. \u201cMy ambition is to keep improving myself, keep improving Brighton as a club, taking us to the next step and just to keep learning and getting better. You can always learn and always improve. If I can do that here and impact that in any way, then I see that as a success and just as good as winning a title at Liverpool or a Champions League.\u201d In victory at Newcastle last month, the average age of Brighton\u2019s starting XI was 24.4 years, the youngest in the division this season. At 32, Lallana was the eldest player on the pitch, four years older than Mat Ryan and Lewis Dunk, the Brighton captain. \u201cI must admit I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a 32-year-old or that I\u2019m close to hanging the boots up, especially in the dressing room. It does not feel like a young team technically, or ability-wise, but maybe mentally you can see our average age is young. \u201cMaybe it is being a little more streetwise, managing the game better in certain situations. You need to almost do things wrong, experience not doing it, to then make sure it does not happen again. Winning helps. Winning matches ugly, it helps. That is what I developed and learned a lot over my time at Liverpool, that side of the game.\u201d Gone are the days of Lallana and Klopp seeing each other put the bins out but in East Sussex, he sees shades of the empowerment given to the German by Liverpool and the faith shown in Potter by Brighton, who gave him a six-year contract in November. \u201cYou know they\u2019re trusting the process and he\u2019s got a group of players who trust the process as well and trust what he says to us, what he wants us to do, how he wants us to play. But these things don\u2019t happen overnight \u2013 at Liverpool it didn\u2019t happen overnight with J\u00fcrgen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
