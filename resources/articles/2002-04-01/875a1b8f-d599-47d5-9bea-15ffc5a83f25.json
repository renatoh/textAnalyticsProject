Making his debut as Kent's championship skipper, he won the toss with a nonchalance that Nasser Hussain might find galling, then ambled to the middle and scored a languid 98, putting on 266 for the first wicket with the England Academy player Rob Key, who had plundered Hampshire for 160, his highest first-class score. Fulton's form provided early vindication of Kent's decision to split leadership duties: he leads the team in four-day games and last season's captain Matthew Fleming takes charge in one-day matches. Although Fulton's nickname is Dave the Rave and he once likened his lifestyle to the TV sitcom Men Behaving Badly, he is bone fide first officer material. The former amateur boxer and occasional journalist has, at 30, clearly settled on a career. It seems astonishing that only a year ago, after long summers of underachievement, he started a make or break season at Canterbury. His 1,892 runs in 2001, which included nine centuries, brought him to the notice of England's selectors. And yesterday his touch was equally sure against an increasingly addled Hampshire attack. Fulton and Key believe in good starts. Last season they each scored a century as they put on 198 in the championship opener against Surrey at the Oval and maintained their form throughout the side's successful summer. Hampshire's bowlers must have reflected that life was much more comfortable in the Second Division. Promotion was won on the back of some impressive seam bowling, Alan Mullally and Alex Morris taking more than 50 wickets each with good support from Chris Tremlett and the off-spinner Shaun Udal. But First Division pitches, as well as batsmen, are better and they will have to improve on an erratic line and length that gifted the Kent pair 26 runs in the first four overs. There are four wicketkeepers in this Hampshire side (Adrian Aymes, Nic Pothas, John Crawley and Derek Kenway) and in the opening session the captain Robin Smith must have been tempted to position them side by side behind the wicket. Crawley and Pothas were playing in their first match for Hampshire and can only hope it gets easier than this. Rain stopped play after 75 minutes. But Kent had already hit 91 from 16.5 overs and, after a delay of another 75 minutes, they continued to race away. Key was the more aggressive of the two, punching all the bowlers to all parts and sauntering through the nineties, when he straight drove Udal for six, to his century. When he cut Mullally for four to reach 134 it was the highest score of his career, beating his 132 at Old Trafford last season. It was the first of three successive boundaries, all hit to the same area. He was finally run out, slow to respond to a quick single. Fulton was more restrained and responsible, but there were still drives that stung fielders' hands on a damp and chilly afternoon. He was eventually out when he drove Neil Johnson straight to Tremlett at mid-off. At tea Kent had reached 220 and Edward Smith and Andrew Symonds saw them to the close without further loss. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
