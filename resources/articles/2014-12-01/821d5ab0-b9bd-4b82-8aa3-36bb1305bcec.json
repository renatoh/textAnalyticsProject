Terrence Hughes, 53, Colin Kaler, 52 and Stuart Tribelnig, 39, worked for G4S on contract to the Home Office, and were accused of manslaughter by forcing the 46-year-old father\u2019s head down and restricting his breathing as a British Airways flight prepared to take off at Heathrow airport on 12 October 2010. A jury at the Old Bailey cleared them of the charges on Tuesday after a six-week trial. \u201cFor the last four years I have fought for justice for Jimmy and our five children,\u201d said Adrienne Makenda Kambana. \u201cIt is hard for me to understand how the jury reached this decision with all the overwhelming evidence that Jimmy said over and over that he could not breathe.\u201d Mubenga was restrained by the three guards after becoming aggressive as the deportation flight prepared to take off at Heathrow. The Old Bailey heard that fellow passengers said Mubenga cried out: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d as he was pinned down in his seat, despite already being handcuffed from behind with his seatbelt on. The jury was not told that an inquest last year returned a verdict of unlawful killing in the case. Neither was the jury told that the inquest had heard that two of the guards \u2013 Hughes and Tribelnig \u2013 had a string of racist \u201cjokes\u201d on their phones. Hughes\u2019s phone had 65 texts containing what the coroner, Karon Monaghan QC, said contained \u201cvery racially offensive material\u201d. The case has sparked calls for immediate reforms of the UK\u2019s system of forced deportations. \u201cI am going to start a campaign to stop this happening again,\u201d Kambana told the Guardian during the trial. \u201cI will ask the Home Office to make sure there is an independent monitor on each deportation so they can observe what is going on. I can\u2019t stand by and watch this happen to another family. I have to do that for Jimmy.\u201d Amnesty International UK and the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, organisations that campaign against abuse in the UK\u2019s deportation system, also called on the Home Office to initiate a \u201cradical overhaul\u201d of its systems. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know which of these [dangerous restraint techniques] are still being used today or if the UK government has actually delivered on its promise to introduce new and safer methods and training,\u201d said Oliver Sprague, Amnesty\u2019s security expert. Jerome Phelps, director of Detention Action, said: \u201cOnce again a migrant has lost their life in detention, and once again no one will ultimately be held to account.\u201d A Home Office spokesman described Mubenga\u2019s death as \u201ca tragedy for those involved\u201d and said \u201cour thoughts are with Jimmy Mubenga\u2019s family\u201d. \u201cWe expect the highest standards of professionalism and conduct from our staff and contractors,\u201d he said. \u201cOur policy has always been that restraint during removals should only be used as a last resort. Our new bespoke training package for aircraft removals, approved in June this year, will better equip our staff with practical tools to minimise the need for restraint and ensure that only the most appropriate techniques are used.\u201d Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, had told the Old Bailey that Mubenga was \u201cfit and healthy\u201d and cooperative before boarding the extradition flight, but he had become upset after talking on his mobile phone in the toilet cubicle. The court also heard he became aggressive. The guards were alleged to have responded by handcuffing him behind his back, forcing him into a seat and pinning him down in a forward-leaning position that affected his ability to breathe. Dennis said: \u201cEach officer would have known from their training and from common sense that keeping someone in such a position was likely to cause a person harm, yet they did so over a prolonged period and did so ignoring shouts from Mr Mubenga that he was in trouble. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 shouts were heard by many a passenger seated further away.\u201d By the time the guards realised Mubenga was in a critical state, it was too late and he had gone into cardiac arrest, Dennis said. The guards said in court that they had not heard Mubenga say he could not breathe and had not pushed his head down and forward towards his knees in a position known to risk asphyxia. They said they had been restraining him to stop him hurting himself or other passengers on the plane. The guards were tearful as they left the dock following the verdict, and said in a statement through their solicitor that they were \u201cdelighted to have been found not guilty so quickly\u201d. \u201cThey bitterly regret the death of Mr Mubenga, but have always said they were trying to do a very difficult job in difficult circumstances to the best of their ability,\u201d said Alex Preston of Olliers Solicitors. \u201cThey are grateful to the judge and jury for the care they have taken resolving these sad events.\u201d A G4S spokesman said: \u201cProviding a safe and caring environment for those in our custody or care is a priority for G4S. The death of Mr Mubenga was a tragic incident and our thoughts and condolences remain with his family and friends. We note the criminal case which has been under way at the Old Bailey in relation to Mr Mubenga\u2019s death and three former employees. We respect the legal process and the findings of the court.\u201d Speaking before the verdict, Mubenga\u2019s widow said: \u201cIt has been so hard. I am trying to be a mother and father at the same time as fighting this. The children miss their father every day \u2013 they are trying to discover the world without his guiding hand. Blessing, who was just six months old when Jimmy died, asks me: \u2019Who is that man in the picture next to you, Mummy?\u2019 She will never know him.\u201d Mark Scott, solicitor for Mubenga\u2019s family, attacked the length of time the criminal justice process had taken. Deborah Coles, the co-director of Inquest, which has been supporting the family, called for a new mechanism for state institutions and the private companies they employ to be held to account when people die. She said: \u201cIt is difficult to reconcile the verdict with the evidence heard at the trial that over 20 people heard Jimmy Mubenga say \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019.\u201d Moot points Amnesty International UK says the affair has raised five unanswered questions: \u2022 Are security guards still using restraint methods that impair breathing? \u2022 Has the UK government introduced scenario-based training suitable for aircraft for security guards? \u2022 Have they delivered on their promise made in 2011 to require private security companies to introduce new safer restraint methods? \u2022 Are guards now required to undergo mandatory training in the safe use of handcuffs during deportations? As far as Amnesty knows it is still only an optional element to their accreditation. \u2022 An inquest last year found that Jimmy Mubenga was unlawfully killed. Who will be held accountable for his death?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
