Black, with maroon pinstripes, the dry-cleaning tag still pinned to the lapel. It\u2019s beautiful material, handmade and still smells good, the traces of smoke and sweat and stage. The pants have no bum, none whatsoever, but the jacket fits surprisingly well on my small frame, slim-fitted. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ll get to Nick Cave, that\u2019s how I figure it, after imagining him as a character for so many years in my novel Almost a Mirror. I find a black wiry hair trapped in a seam and hide it for safekeeping. When I tell my male friends about the suit, they vie for my attention, insisting they are the perfect fit. I imagine them lined up in a St Kilda alley, thin and lanky, smoking \u2013 like Cinderella hoping to be invited to the ball(room). The suit hangs and swings as I drive, and I realise it\u2019s worth more than my car. I\u2019m heading to the home of Andy Griffiths, the world-renowned author of the Storey Treehouse series, where he lives with his partner and co-author Jill. A Nick Cave fanatic, Andy has just purchased the suit for $10,000 in an auction bid for the #AuthorsForFireys appeal \u2013 a donation that I, another Nick Cave fanatic, had facilitated. When I arrive, Andy tries the jacket on too. It fits \u2013 but the suit isn\u2019t for him. He bought it for the skeleton in the studio out the back where he works. I ask why he put in a bid. \u201cFirst and foremost, I was really affected by the fires and also the bravery of the firefighters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe take creative risks as artists but not life-threatening risks. I was so angry at the \u2026 state of play for the last decade. [Scott Morrison] is just so obstinate on this issue. I was filled with rage at this fucking awful government.\u201d Like Nick Cave, Andy \u2014 known then by his stage name Griff Griffiths \u2014 was attracted to the post-punk Melbourne music scene in the late 70s and early 80s, and hovered around the Crystal Ballroom: an elegantly wasted venue in St Kilda that hosted bands including the Birthday Party, the Cure, New Order and Go-Betweens. I wasn\u2019t old enough to be part of the Ballroom scene and so in my book I inhabit a performative space, exploring the mythology that surrounds Nick Cave and his fellow musicians. Andy was part of it though. He saw his first gig there: Midnight Oil in November, 1979. He remembers because it was the last day of Year 12. \u201cWe sat outside the station just drinking, getting as drunk as we could, so we didn\u2019t have to pay money inside,\u201d he says. At that point the band was \u201cthe best kept secret in the world \u2026 Pure energy coming from the stage. Mind blowing, really exciting.\u201d Andy is good with dates and has a uniquely detailed memory. Partly this is because he\u2019s kept everything from childhood onwards: early stories, song lyrics, band memorabilia and photos, cassettes taped from the radio carefully labelled in a drawer. He is an archivist\u2019s dream. Over lunch with Jill, he lovingly shows me set lists from bands like Snakefinger and Dead Kennedys grabbed at the end of gigs, reads me lyrics from his high school days in first band Unborn Babies, and shows photos and hand-drawn flyers from when he rocked up to the Ballroom with a later band, Gothic Farmyard. On stage he was the lead singer; he couldn\u2019t play an instrument, but was renowned for his manic energy and beating himself up, colliding, bashing his head blood-raw. \u201cWe were committed to making every show an event,\u201d he says. \u201cThe end goal was to get a gig at the Ballroom. That was you already successful beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d He loved the venue because it welcomed all comers. \u201cAnd the beauty of it for someone like me ... was that any band that got on stage at the Ballroom would have an audience prepared to take us seriously and try to figure us out,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t heckling or anything.\u201d Andy was always drawn to Nick Cave and Rowland S Howard while hanging around the Ballroom; he talks passionately about the Birthday Party gigs, especially one at the Astor. \u201cIf anyone asked me what\u2019s the best gig you\u2019ve ever been to? I\u2019ll just go straight back to 1982,\u201d he says. \u201cNick, Tracey Pew in the background with his 10-gallon hat and stomping around, and Rowland\u2019s cigarette hanging out his mouth, making music.\u201d Returning from London, they \u201chad kind of transformed from this Melbourne band to a world band and they were full of dark energy and anger,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were just at the height of their powers \u2026 full throttle. Opened the gates of hell, and primal energy came out.\u201d It\u2019s clear the influence of the place has been profound, the sensibility of the time \u2013 the chaos, and wild energy \u2013 infusing all of Andy\u2019s writing. Nick Cave was a particular inspiration. \u201cHe\u2019s been lucky to do his own thing. And that\u2019s probably what I value the most about him as an artist,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I realised when I started writing \u2018seriously\u2019 that I wasn\u2019t like other writers \u2026 I just couldn\u2019t write a sensible novel. In the end, everything I did was derailed by the anarchic Devo punk rock energy.\u201d While Andy Griffiths is now a global phenomenon for the wildly popular and hilarious books he writes with illustrator Terry Denton, it took years before his work reached an audience. He has never seen himself as a children\u2019s writer, either: his early Bad Book series caught many (including A Current Affair), off guard with its gut-churningly funny depictions of children in peril, including a mother who encourages her child to run across a busy road (so many of the punchlines end in gratuitously ridiculous deaths). Early on, he made a conscious decision to stick with his own offbeat style \u2013 \u201creally funny, off the wall, strange stuff\u201d \u2013 even if it meant not having a recognisable career. Artists like Nick Cave \u201cdon\u2019t bend over backwards to get to their audience,\u201d he says. \u201cThey go, \u2018This is what I do, and this is what I have to do,\u2019 \u2014 and then they do it. And I loved the courage of that. So, I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m an outsider artist in my heart.\u2019 I probably am, dammit.\u201d In retrospect, embracing the anarchic and punk spirit was the perfect decision. \u201c[Kids] are a very critical audience, they can spot a try-hard from a million miles away,\u201d he says. \u201cThey realised I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny; I just was doing what I do, and they could come to me. And so, I think they just heard the voice, the pure energy at that point, because I wasn\u2019t trying to make them like me.\u201d After lunch, Andy leads me to his studio where he takes time to dress the skeleton, carefully adjusting the arms, while pointing out Ballroom-era memorabilia and music that lines the walls. Eyeballs pop out of the skeleton\u2019s head and roll along the floor. He shows me the many tattoos on his arms including one of the Saints\u2019 record I\u2019m Stranded. Later, walking me in the direction of the train station, we chat about the next Storey Treehouse and both come to the idea at the same time. Andy promises that in the upcoming book there will be a room for the skeleton wearing Nick\u2019s suit.
