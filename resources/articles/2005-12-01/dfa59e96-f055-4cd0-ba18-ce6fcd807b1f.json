The danger now is that the talks will go on and on in the background - global trade's Jarndyce and Jarndyce - without grabbing the attention of the handful of politicians who could re-invigorate the process before the US's \"fast track\" presidential authorisation powers expire in 2007. The talks have been a disgraceful and tragic failure compared with the original stated ideals. This, remember, was to be a development round of trade talks. Its aim was to help the poorest countries out of trade poverty caused by lack of access to western markets and by having to compete with agricultural products buttressed by uneconomic subsidies which it ought to be in the western countries' self-interest to demolish. There were a few crumbs for the poor from Hong Kong, such as a date for the elimination of export subsidies (but not until 2013). There was a relief package for some struggling African cotton producers. But the US resisted calls for rapid elimination of the scandalous $4bn a year given to its own cotton growers - much of which is deemed illegal by the World Trade Organisation - thus preventing African farmers from expanding one of the few products in which they have a natural advantage. There was little movement on reducing high western tariff barriers. According to the World Bank, agricultural products face a \"practically insurmountable global average tariff rate of 62%\". But everything is not always as it seems. By making a late concession, the EU has at least kept the show on the road. There may also be movement within the common agricultural policy that has been underestimated. It is almost the end of the first year of the EU's move to \"decouple\" agricultural production from the subsidies hitherto umbilically linked to them. If the experience of the British farmer Oliver Walston (discussed by Simon Jenkins in Friday's Guardian) is typical, then Europe - except France, which negotiated a brief postponement - may be starting to experience a farming change of seismic proportions for which it may not have been given sufficient credit. If so, then countries such as the US and Japan should take note. They should accelerate reform in their own countries without waiting for unjustifiable concessions from developing nations. Meanwhile, it is absolutely vital that the momentum of the Doha round be stepped up in 2006. The process must not be killed by the mood of selfishness in the talks so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
