Presented to the United Nations today, the report highlights discrimination, land grabbing and violence against tsunami survivors in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Maldives and Indonesia. It said governments in those countries \"have stood by or been complicit as land has been grabbed and coastal communities pushed aside in favour of commercial interests\". The report, Tsunami Response - a Human Rights Assessment, studied 95 towns and villages hit by the disaster and found extensive evidence of forced relocation. In Andhrah Pradesh, India, residents were moved 2km inland from their original village so a new tourist resort could be built. A Thai villager told the researchers: \"I came to the village the day after the tsunami to look for my children, but the guards had already put a fence up. I begged them to let me in, but they said it was their land they would be building a hotel. \"They held their guns and said that, if I didn't go, I would join those who died.\" The report said: \"With coastal land at a premium for tourism and sea areas coveted by industrial fishing companies, the governments of India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand are discouraging - and even preventing - people from returning to their original land and fishing in areas.\" In some areas, governments have only paid compensation to those who relinquish their rights to coastal land. The report added: \"Economically and politically powerful sections of society have been allowed to exploit the disaster for private gain at the expense of the most vulnerable.\" The report also highlighted widespread discrimination against women. In Sri Lanka, the government only gave compensation to men - denying help to widows and other single women. In Indonesia, women were put in danger of sexual assault by the authorities' failure to provide safe emergency shelter. Mokens, or sea gypsies, who roam the Thai coast in boats for their livelihood, were also denied help, as were lower castes in India. In a foreword to the report, Milon Kothari, the United Nations special rapporteur on adequate housing, said relief efforts had been \"fraught with difficulties\". He said: \"Inadequate response and a lack of considerations for the human rights of victims creates a human induced tragedy that exacerbates the plight of those already suffering the effects of a disaster brought on by natural causes.\" The report was compiled by ActionAid International, the People's Movement for Human Rights Education and Habitat International Coalition. ActionAid's chief executive, Ramesh Singh, said: \"A major effort is required to correct the wrongs that characterise the first year of tsunami response. \"Emergency help should reach all those who need it, not a selected few. The governments should be ashamed of their record.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
