It was the player's second transgression since January when he was forced to apologise for appearing to dress as a suicide bomber at a private party. The 24-year-old has a hamstring injury and did not travel with the team for Saturday's 2-0 Premier League win at West Ham United but his behaviour was not received well by Moyes, especially as the manager had offered his support to Smalling following the previous episode two months ago. Asked if he had seen the pictures of Smalling in the Spinningfield area of Manchester, Moyes said: \"I've dealt with it and I've spoken to Chris. That would be as much as I would want to say on it.\" Pressed if Smalling was available to face Manchester City at Old Trafford on Tuesday, Moyes was terse. \"I've given you the answer,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
