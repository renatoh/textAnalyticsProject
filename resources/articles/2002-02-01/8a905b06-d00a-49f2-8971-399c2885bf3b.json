It was their third win and confirmed the German boat's position as race leader. Kostecki said the end of the leg was \"pretty nerve-racking\". He added: \"We were always expecting the worst and expecting the worst is probably the best at the time.\" The four boats immediately behind Illbruck had closed the gap from 100 miles five days ago to under 25, but progress to the finish was painfully slow and it was six hours before the second-placed boat, Knut Frostad's Djuice, crossed the line. It was her best performance in the race so far. Frostad put the improvement down to intensive sail trials in Auckland, and to his navigator Jean-Yves Bernot for taking them close to the shore in the final hours. \"Our navigator is an awesome guy,\" he said. \"His prediction was spot on. He said to me: 'Knut, I don't have a clue whether it's going to go wrong, but all my instincts say go to the land, because if something's going to come good, it will come from the land.' And we did it.\" An hour and a quarter later, Kevin Shoebridge with Tyco came in third, with Neal McDonald, the British skipper of Assa Abloy, next, a further 75 minutes behind. Amer Sports One, skippered by Grant Dalton, was fifth. McDonald described the Southern Ocean as \"pretty frightening. I generally don't get too scared about these things,\" he said, \"but I didn't like the ice.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
