The Belgian, who has struggled at Old Trafford since his move from Everton, was brought on by Louis van Gaal for the second half in place of Ander Herrera with West Bromwich leading 1-0. \u201cFellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath,\u201d ran a tweet on West Brom\u2019s official Twitter account. Fellaini equalised shortly afterwards after chesting down a cross and lashing the ball into the net. The game ended in a 2-2 draw. Albion later wrote a further tweet to say they had meant no offence by their earlier remark. \u201cSorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage. It was not intended as a slur,\u201d the tweet read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
