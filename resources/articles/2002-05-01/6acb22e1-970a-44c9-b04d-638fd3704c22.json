We were on a behind-the-scenes tour of Christ Church, Oxford, where Lewis Carroll lived and taught for over 40 years (tourism@chch.ox.ac.uk). How do you make a toffee-nosed academic town like Oxford attractive to a child? I knew she wouldn't be the slightest bit interested in the musty old buildings. But she would be interested in Alice. Fred Wharton, a former CID detective turned Christ Church head custodian, took us where few tread.

Not to mention the fact that the book about an irritating boy with magical powers and round spectacles was filmed on Christ Church's great stairway. Perhaps it's where Harry met Alice. Alice is everywhere in Oxford (Alice in Oxford lists all the city's Alice attractions). The Dodo is in the Pitt Rivers Museum; Alice's dress is in the Oxford Museum. There's even Alice's Gallery and Tearoom, where we should have had jam tarts, but devoured sticky toffee pudding instead (Sheep Shop). So convincing was Fred in pointing out all the places where Alice once was, that Storme began to wonder if she'd made a mistake in thinking the book she'd read was just a story. \"Is Alice in Wonderland true?\" she asked, on the way home.
