Ireland modestly played down their chances, Italy and Scotland spoke of putting past disappointments behind them, France lamented their relative lack of training time together and Wales and England insisted the World Cup would not dilute the significance of their next meeting. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was in plentiful supply. Leaving aside the familiar diplomatic platitudes, however, there is every reason to believe the 2015 championship will live up to its new official tagline as \u201cRugby\u2019s Greatest Championship\u201d when it kicks off next week. The France coach, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, reckons any one of four teams could win it and he is probably right. The only certainty is that what seemed likely at the end of January will look absurd by mid-March. To paraphrase Warren Gatland, expectation and reality are never further apart in northern hemisphere rugby than at this time of year. Saint-Andr\u00e9, interestingly, also suggested that the job of coaching France and England is tougher than it is for the other nations. There will be cries of disbelief in Wales, where rugby is such a part of the national psyche, but Saint-Andr\u00e9 was referring specifically to the intense physical demands of the Top 14 and Premiership and the knock-on effect for Six Nations planning in those countries. Saint-Andr\u00e9 confesses that, since he took over as France coach, he has given up theorising months in advance about what his best team might look like. Instead he now simply waits until the last minute to see how many fit bodies he has available and chooses accordingly. Which, of course, is precisely the situation in which Stuart Lancaster currently finds himself. The red rose injury bulletins continue to be downbeat, with the number of players set to be unavailable for the Wales game extending to double figures. There is also the small matter of the Millennium Stadium hangover from two years ago, which Lancaster acknowledges is still at the back of English minds. \u201cEveryone has to improve their levels for us to beat Wales, because that is a game at the top end of the international spectrum. It\u2019s on a Friday night, it\u2019s in Wales, it\u2019s a side stacked full of British Lions and they don\u2019t seem to have suffered as many injuries as we have, so they have that.\u201d Lancaster is equally adamant, however, that England must travel with a degree of self-belief. Having reviewed the November win over Australia, he still feels it was a highly creditable home performance and is keen to maintain that momentum across the Severn Bridge when England return to the scene of their 30-3 mauling in 2013. \u201cWe have to learn the lessons from two years ago, without a doubt. We didn\u2019t play well enough on the day and when it got to 17-3 at around 50 minutes, we allowed ourselves to slip into trying to solve problems on our own. In international rugby you can\u2019t do that. I think we\u2019ve learned the lessons about sticking to the plan and we\u2019ve done that a lot better recently.\u201d Gatland, for his part, is not buying into the theory that England will limp into Cardiff like lambs to the slaughter because of their long injury list. \u201cEngland have a huge amount of strength in depth in a lot of positions. It does not matter what team they put out. The challenge for us is to make sure we don\u2019t allow the injuries to become a distraction and people talk us up too much. England will be a strong side whatever happens.\u201d Both he and his captain, Sam Warburton, also do not expect England to be blown away as they were last time they visited the Millennium Stadium. \u201cYou learn from experiences and a lot of those players two years ago had not played at the Millennium Stadium before and experienced that sort of intensity,\u201d stressed Gatland. \u201cLast year we lost at Twickenham in a game we could have won after playing poorly. So we all have a bit of baggage over the last couple of years.\u201d The engaging, impressive Warburton was equally keen to talk up the English, clearly conscious of the game\u2019s significance to the championship outcome as a whole. \u201cI am expecting a tough game. Two years ago I don\u2019t think the scoreboard reflected the match. It was an arm wrestle for quite a while. It was only a couple of tries in quick succession which made the score look favourable for Wales. There are a couple of teams in the world I find difficult to play against and England are one of them. Regardless of their injuries they have boys who can step in and it won\u2019t affect them too much.\u201d Ireland will be hoping the same applies to their challenge as they seek to defend their title without the retired Brian O\u2019Driscoll. They are likely to be stronger towards the end of the championship than at the start but Joe Schmidt made the valid point that injury-hit teams who sit and mope will get nowhere. What matters more than medical updates is ensuring that whatever team takes the field performs to its optimum level, a trick he has mastered with increasing regularity. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to adapt,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cIf you don\u2019t adapt well enough you do become vulnerable.\u201d Schmidt\u2019s other warning was reserved for those tempted to dismiss Scotland under their new coach, Vern Cotter. Cotter and Schmidt worked together at Clermont before going their separate ways and know each other\u2019s methods inside out. \u201cHe\u2019ll pretend to be a simple New Zealand farmer because he wants people to underestimate what he brings to a team,\u201d suggested Schmidt, who still hopes Jonathan Sexton will be fit for his own side\u2019s home game against France in round two. Perhaps the best bet is that at least one Kiwi coach will enjoy an uplifting championship. Lancaster and Saint-Andr\u00e9 are the only coaches in charge of their native countries, with the Frenchman Jacques Brunel still pulling the strings in Italy. The Azzurri will remain the wooden spoon favourites but, as their captain Sergio Parisse coolly observed, in perfect English, they \u201ccan put any team in the world under pressure at the set-piece\u201d. The last word, though, has to go to the French in the wake of the horrific recent events across the Channel. Saint-Andr\u00e9 believes the Paris shootings may provide extra motivation for the national team before their opener against Scotland. \u201cI think La Marseillaise will be quite emotional given what has happened in our country over the last few weeks,\u201d suggested the coach. With the World Cup also at the back of everyone\u2019s minds, it looks set to be a rousing championship in every respect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
