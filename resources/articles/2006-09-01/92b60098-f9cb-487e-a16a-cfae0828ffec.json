It's a major movie winner", "bodyText": "Bella, a romantic drama by the Mexican director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, has won the top award at the Toronto Film Festival, while the contentious Death of a President took a critics' prize. Bella, starring the director's wife Ali Landry, tells the story of two people whose lives converge and turn upside down on a single day in New York. It won the People's Choice Award at the festival, which is seen as the start of the Hollywood Oscars season. Death of a President, to be shown in Britain on More4, provoked controversy before the festival. It is a fictional documentary about the assassination of President George Bush in 2007 after his 'war on terror' further polarised America. The jury praised 'the audacity with which it distorts reality to reveal a larger truth'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
