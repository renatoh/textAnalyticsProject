About 50,000 mostly elderly mourners paid their last respects to Slobodan Milosevic in central Belgrade on Saturday, chanting his name as Serb Socialist and nationalist leaders lauded his legacy, along with visiting Communist party chiefs from Russia and Bulgaria. Milosevic was then taken 50 miles to his family home in the bleak industrial town of Pozarevac, where about 20,000 people saw him buried under the lime tree in his back garden where he is said to have first kissed his future wife, Mira Markovic. Rather than return to Serbia and face corruption charges, Mrs Markovic watched the funeral on television in Moscow with her son, who fled Belgrade when his father was toppled in October 2000. He was quoted in Belgrade's Press newspaper as saying: \"This is terrible. I'm sitting here with my mother in front of the TV and I can't believe it. My mother is shaking. For God's sake, this is not a funeral, this is a political rally!\" Yesterday evening, he told Belgrade's BK television he was in fact satisfied by what he called \"a true people's funeral, the funeral of a national leader\". But in Montenegro, the only former Yugoslav republic still bound to Serbia after the wars led by Milosevic in the 1990s, his daughter, Marija, seemed inconsolable and vowed to have the body exhumed. \"Nowhere on our planet are people being buried in their backyards,\" she said. \"There is no reason any more for me to have any contact with my family.\" After Serbia's leaders ruled out a state funeral, she had requested a burial in the family's ancestral home in Montenegro. She too refused to return to Belgrade, where she is wanted for firing shots when her father was arrested in April 2001. She attacked the dozens of Serb party officials who gathered, teary-eyed, at his funeral, for trying to make political capital out of his death on March 11 during his UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
