Four and a half feet to make an eagle three. Four and a half feet to go 11 under for the tournament. Four and a half feet to edge ahead of the squabbling pack. Four and a half feet to put his career back on track, and maybe to change his destiny. All his working life, up until November 2009, Tiger Woods had been making putts like that. Once it would have been practically a gimme. On Sunday, with everything at stake, after a magnificent comeback on the front nine, followed by a perfect drive and a laser-guided six-iron from 207 yards out to the 15th green, a pair of strokes that recalled the steel-nerved best of Woods's triumphs at Augusta National, the ball rolled gently around the lip on the right-hand edge of the hole, oblivious to the consequences of its errant path. Had it dropped, had he pulled clear of the Schwartzels and the Scotts, the Days and the Chois, you would not have found a soul on the course to bet against him closing out his fifth US Masters title. And his success would have seemed so inevitable that the story of the preceding three days would have been effortlessly rewritten into a narrative of unstoppable triumph. Woods's failure at the 15th opened the way for Charl Schwartzel, a gifted 26-year-old from Johannesburg who became the 10th different champion in the last 10 major championships, the clearest of signals that we are in a post-Woods era. The modest South African managed to honour all the 2011 tournament's significant anniversaries. He was a worthy winner of the 75th tournament. He shares his nationality with Gary Player, who became the first non-American winner at Augusta National 50 years ago. And he took the final steps to victory with four birdies on the final four holes, like Jack Nicklaus in his autumnal triumph 25 years ago. It was just the kind of finish that would once have been expected of the man in the red shirt, who instead found himself in a three-way tie for fourth place. So now Woods finds himself plunged back into the mire of speculation and scepticism. It is still getting on for three years since he last won a major, the 2008 US Open. This year's earnings on the PGA tour look likely to be closer to 2010's $1,294,765 \u2013 less than he would have earned from winning this year's Masters alone \u2013 than to 2009's prelapsarian $10,508,163. Not to mention the revenue from endorsements, which continues to dwindle at a rate experienced only by Wayne Rooney. Woods's demeanour through the 2011 Masters could best be described as charmless. From a man who vowed to use his humiliation as a spur to improving his relationship with the outside world, there was little beyond the most cursory of responses to encouragement from the gallery and questions from the media. This was particularly noticeable during a tournament in which we made the acquaintance not just of the impressive Schwartzel but of the equally likeable Jason Day of Australia and Alvaro Quir\u00f3s of Spain. Above all, the events of Sunday will have reminded Woods that he is now 35 years old. Golf is less age-critical than most sports, but it was he who introduced a new set of athletic criteria to the game. Already the target of four major wins that stands between him and Nicklaus is looking more demanding with every passing year; if he does not hurry up, he may find himself swept away by an incoming tide. After all the discussion of his latest swing overhaul, the week suggested that the major technical elements of his game are back in place. For a man whose driving has been the chief casualty of the problems with his swing, he will have been justifiably pleased to have hit 12 of 14 fairways on Sunday. But he might be doing himself a favour if he stopped coming in after a round of 30 putts and insisting he had \"putted beautifully all day\", as he did after the first day of the Masters. What he needs is realism, not self-delusion. Animal rights and wrongs The trivial row over the BBC's coverage of the equine fatalities during the Grand National is being allowed to obscure the real issue. As Ornais and Dooney's Gate lay dead with a broken neck and a broken back respectively, Jason Maguire jumped off the winner, Ballabriggs, just past the winning post in order to allow the horse to be given oxygen and a cold-water spray. Tony McCoy, finishing third, was similarly swift to dismount in order to allow Don't Push It to receive urgent attention. Daryl Jacob pulled Sir Alex Ferguson's What a Friend out of the race with four jumps to go because the horse \"felt very tired\". There must be a reason for all this enervation, and it is not the Aintree course, which has been eased over the years. It is fair to assume, too, that the physical preparation of thoroughbreds has become more sophisticated. But several years ago the authors of Animal Aid's Riding for a Fall survey accused the equine world of a whole range of misdemeanours, including the harmful disruption of mares' breeding cycles and the dangerous overworking of stallions at stud. The allegation that caught my eye was a claim that owners were now going all out to breed more speed into National Hunt horses, at the expense of the traditional robustness. Saturday's unhappy events suggest that they may have been on to something. One team to rule the others Goodness knows how many millions of pounds have been expended on the current round of efforts to make Formula One more rewarding for spectators by introducing power-boost systems, moveable aerodynamic devices and tyres intended to degrade more rapidly. The only effect of these changes seems to have been the addition of further layers of complexity to a sport whose nuances are already beyond the comprehension of the average spectator. And in any case what we have \u2013 as we had with Ascari in 1952, Fangio in 1954 and 1955, Clark in 1963, Mansell in 1992 and Schumacher in 2002 and 2005 \u2013 is the sight of one combination of car and driver so superior to the rest that efforts to engineer artificial excitement into the sport are made to look hopelessly self-defeating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
