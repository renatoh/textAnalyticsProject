Claims can be turned down for any number of reasons \u2013 such as if you fail to report the loss within 24 hours, or if the theft in the street was not accompanied by an actual threat of physical violence. Phones taken from schools or from public spaces, often including public transport, are rarely covered \u2026 and so on. This led us to conclude in the past that mobile phone insurance wasn't worth the money, especially when handset costs weren't that high. However, with the latest smartphones \u2013 particularly Apple iPhones \u2013 now costing around \u00a3600 to replace, we have had to reassess. A quick look on internet chatrooms shows there is huge interest in finding a cheap way to insure smartphones, but no one appears to have come up with a stand-out policy. The simplest way to cover a handset is to buy your phone network's own policy. But these can be very expensive. Buy an iPhone 4S from Vodafone, and its Cover Me insurance costs \u00a312.99 a month, or almost \u00a3312 over a two-year contract. Orange charges a similar \u00a312 a month. A cheaper option is to buy cover from one of the plethora of firms now offering to insure smartphones. Away from the big-name retailers, two of the best-known are Foneguard and TalkCover, and they offer insurance from \u00a35.33 and \u00a36.66 a month respectively for iPhones. Again there are plenty of exclusions, and in the case of TalkCover, there's an excess of \u00a3100 for an iPhone claim. Undoubtedly the cheapest option is to add the phone to your home insurance, usually as a \"possessions outside the home\" extra. This could cost as little as \u00a330 a year, and there will be other benefits. You need to check the excess on the policy \u2013 again, it could be \u00a3100. However, you should weigh up how likely you are to claim. Contents insurance now gives significant no-claims discounts, meaning your premium could shoot up if you make a claim. You may take the view that you would rather not have your iPhone tangled up with your home insurance. The best option we have found is Barclaycard's Gadget Insurance. You don't need to be a card carrier to insure the latest iPhone for \u00a35.99 a month, or just under \u00a372 a year. A BlackBerry costs \u00a31.49 a month, and an iPad, \u00a34.88. There's a \u00a350 excess for iPhones, other smartphones and iPads, and while the policy has several notable caveats, it isn't quite as full of exclusions as some. It includes accidental damage. As with any policy, make sure you go through the small print. If you have had a good or bad experience with Barclaycard's insurance or think there's a better policy out there, email money@theguardian.com Lastly, follow these simple precautions to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of theft: \u2022 Watch out for people on bikes and mopeds, and don't use your phone if someone could whizz by and grab it. \u2022 Don't check your phone as soon as you leave a tube or train station \u2013 leave it a while, or walk into a shop. \u2022 Don't text and walk \u2013 you will be less aware of what is happening around you. \u2022 If you're talking outside, stand with your back against a wall so no one can come up behind you. \u2022 Register your phone and other property at immobilise.com \u2013 it can help recover your property and capture thieves. You will need your phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number, which you can find by typing *#06# into your phone.
