Mar\u00eda, 26, was scared too, and not just because this deportation flight was her first time in the air. They were returning to Guatemala \u2013 the country they had fled after a gang murdered all their living relatives. The pair had been reunited in a Phoenix-area airport just a few hours before, nearly a year after border officials at an Arizona port of entry separated them. Mar\u00eda had raised her niece as a daughter since the girl was an infant. But border officials did not recognize them as a family unit and sent the girl to foster care in New York and Mar\u00eda to an immigrant detention center in Arizona. Mar\u00eda, who could not shake the memory of her little girl being ripped out of her arms, had waited a year to hug her niece. They both wept. The moment was bittersweet. Mar\u00eda and her girl landed in Guatemala as the coronavirus was taking hold in countries around the world. On the day of their deportation flight, the World Health Organization declared the rapidly growing outbreak a pandemic. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated concerns for immigrants held in detention centers across the US. At least four migrant children in government shelters in New York have tested positive for Covid-19, as have six adult detainees and five detention officers. Immigrant rights advocates, health experts, some members of Congress and even a former official for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) are calling for detainees to be released due to the risks of the virus spreading. For deported asylum seekers like Mar\u00eda, the crisis means many are returning to even more dire situations than the threats they originally fled. In Guatemala, the local economy is paralyzed by the pandemic, with businesses and many government offices shuttered. For those arriving on deportation flights, finding jobs and housing has become all but impossible. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The US has deported more than 11,600 people to Guatemala since the beginning of this year, according to data from Guatemala\u2019s Migration Institute. As the corona crisis intensified, concern grew among Guatemalan officials about deportation flights contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Within a week of Mar\u00eda\u2019s 11 March arrival, the Guatemalan government closed its borders and announced no new deportation flights from the US could come in until Guatemala prepared new health protocols for repatriated citizens. The flights resumed a few days later but are now less frequent. Ice has begun taking the temperatures of immigrants before they board. Anyone testing above 100.4F gets referred to a medical screening. Guatemalan officials check again when the passengers deplane. The repatriated citizens are then instructed to self-quarantine. Still, a 29-year-old man on a 26 March deportation flight from Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend, Guatemala\u2019s health ministry confirmed, and became the country\u2019s 36th case. (The country had confirmed 10 more cases, as of Wednesday night.) \u201cPrior to boarding, the detainee was screened and neither had a temperature nor presented symptoms at that time,\u201d said an Ice spokesperson in a statement. The agency said before he was deported, the man was booked into a Calexico, California, facility on 5 March and was transferred to a facility in Florence, Arizona, on 17 March. Officials at Guatemala\u2019s foreign relations ministry have said they will continue to receive deportation flights for now. When Mar\u00eda and her niece arrived at the Guatemalan airport, local authorities took their temperatures but didn\u2019t offer any further assistance or support, Mar\u00eda told the Guardian in Spanish. The pair\u2019s first days in Guatemala were confusing, she said. As she had no family left in the country, her former cellmate at the Eloy detention center offered her a place to stay. But American officials had failed to give Mar\u00eda back her Guatemalan ID before her flight, and with Guatemalan government offices closed amid the pandemic, she cannot replace it. She tried to bring a sense of normalcy to her little girl\u2019s life. They went to church, they celebrated the girl\u2019s seventh birthday and they had Guatemala\u2019s classic Pollo Campero chicken. Mar\u00eda was relieved to eat something besides the potato-based meals served in detention. But with the pandemic lurking, things were anything but normal. Eleven days after Mar\u00eda arrived, President Alejandro Giammattei, a former doctor, instituted a nationwide lockdown between 4pm and 4am every day. Since then, Guatemala\u2019s national civil police have detained more than 5,000 people for violating the rules. Public service announcements show images of deserted streets, bridges and bus stops. Police parade through neighborhoods playing the national anthem, and the president, wearing a protective mask, provides updates on social media. On Sunday, Giammattei said that public officials were doing everything they could to contain Covid-19, but also \u201cto preserve the economic stability that the country has had for a long time\u201d. \u201cIt is a great challenge, it\u2019s not easy, but if we unite it will be easier,\u201d he said. Small business owners in Guatemala City like Sergio Vald\u00e9s don\u2019t see such a promising forecast. Just 20 days after he opened the doors of his small restaurant, he had to close its doors. He was allowed to offer takeout, but his five employees could not get to work due to public transportation closures. \u201cThe president says that everything is going to get better, but that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d Vald\u00e9s said. \u201cIf you keep a business closed for a while, it will die.\u201d Many Guatemalans who rely on remittances from family members in the US are losing that income as the US unemployment rate climbs. Migrant shelters in Guatemala have reported requests for help from not only migrants and those recently deported, but also Guatemalans who have lost their livelihoods due to the shut-down economy. The global pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of populations already living on the fringes, said Father Mauro Verzeletti, director of Casa del Migrante, a shelter in Guatemala City. In a recent tweet, Guatemala\u2019s ombudsman for human rights, Jord\u00e1n Rodas Andrade, called for a moratorium on deportations, or at least a slowdown, that would allow the country\u2019s system of shelters to ramp up to meet the needs of these populations. But deportation proceedings for many detained immigrants have continued. The US government is requiring immigration attorneys to bring their own N95 masks, eye protection and gloves at a time when those items are in short supply for healthcare workers. And under new border policies adopted by the Trump administration since the Covid-19 pandemic, most migrants and asylum seekers apprehended crossing the border are now swiftly returned to their countries. Those asking for asylum at ports of entry are turned away. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Mar\u00eda looked for work as a waitress as soon as she arrived. She knocked on the doors of 15 restaurants and was rejected each time. \u201cRight now, no one is hiring workers, they\u2019re firing people,\u201d Mar\u00eda said. Under the lockdown, she has had to put her search on hold. Mar\u00eda\u2019s options in Guatemala are limited, particularly since it is not safe for her to go back to her home town. She and her little girl fled Guatemala for the US in late 2018 after the same gang that murdered Mar\u00eda\u2019s entire family over a land dispute, including the little girl\u2019s mother, killed Mar\u00eda\u2019s partner and shot at Mar\u00eda. Last summer, a US immigration judge found Mar\u00eda\u2019s account credible but decided her case did not meet the narrow legal standard for asylum. Mar\u00eda filed an appeal but could no longer endure being locked up away from her niece. Because she was not the girl\u2019s biological mother, Ice refused to release her from detention to reunite the family. After nearly a year apart, Mar\u00eda requested deportation with the hope she and the girl could return together. \u201cIt was notably easier for Ice to concede the bona fides of the relationship between Mar\u00eda and her niece when removal to Guatemala was the goal,\u201d said Suzannah Maclay, Mar\u00eda\u2019s attorney. Mar\u00eda was craving freedom after so long in detention but still finds herself spending her days inside. She wants her niece to go to school and get the education she never got. She feels restless, unable to start building a better life for them both. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said. She believes the gang that murdered her family still wants to kill her, and she is always fearful they will discover she is back. She doesn\u2019t want her niece to grow up alone. She tries to give the girl a sense of security, but the truth is hard to hide. \u201cWhy did they send us here?\u201d the girl asked her upon arriving in Guatemala. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d As Mar\u00eda and her child focus on day-to-day survival, they are also trying to heal from the trauma of their separation. Sometimes the girl tells Mar\u00eda about foster care in New York. The stories are hard to hear. The girl describes getting her hands slapped when she touched things or being scolded in restaurants. \u201cThey humiliated her,\u201d Mar\u00eda said. \u201cMami, I missed you so much,\u201d the girl tells her. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be apart again.\u201d Mar\u00eda responds with a promise: \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Grecia Ortiz in Guatemala City contributed reporting"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
