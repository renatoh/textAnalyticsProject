But there is one condition: if Jalabert wins, he might extend his career another week to display the coveted rainbow jersey in the final races of the professional season. Since he announced his retirement at the Tour de France in July, the 33-year-old has been busily engaged in what the French call a tourn\u00e9e d'adieu - a round of goodbyes at races throughout his home country. The pattern has been the same: a sea of autograph hunters, emotional announcements from the commentator Daniel Mangeas, the voice of French cycling, and shy smiles from the baggy-eyed man they call the Panda. With the Belgian Johan Museeuw, whose even longer career ends next year, Jalabert is one of the last of the old school of cycling greats, willing to race anywhere rather than focus on one event. His palmares include a world time-trial championship, two King of the Mountains titles in the Tour de France, six single-day Classics, the points classifications in the tours of Spain, Italy and France, and almost four years at the top of the world rankings. Such all-round success is now a thing of the past, however. \"With Laurent the profession of bike racing is disappearing,\" claims his former manager Manolo Saiz. \"He and others will give way to what I call part-time cyclists, only interested in racing for one or two months a year. A whole era is ending with Laurent's departure.\" As the Tour de France prepares for its centenary, the departure of \"Jaja\" means there will be no Frenchman anywhere near the top of world cycling next year. Jalabert began his career as a sprinter but acquired an all-rounder's skills after a horrific crash in the finish straight at Armenti\u00e8res in the 1994 Tour convinced him there were safer ways to earn a cycling crust. The next year was a good one, including a memorable escape on the Tour's Bastille Day stage to Mende, when Indurain floundered. In 2000 he won a second Bastille Day Tour stage, the King of the Mountains jersey and the hearts of the French public. The soft-voiced man has lost the effervescent fitness that made him the toast of this year's Tour and won him the San Sebastian World Cup Classic in August. \"My aim is to enjoy myself and show my face,\" he said this week. The flat, windy circuit means a bunch sprint is the most likely outcome tomorrow, and the favourites include the Italian Mario Cipollini, the Australian Robbie McEwen and the defending champion Oscar Freire of Spain. \u00b7 Today, the Welsh prodigy Nicole Cooke has her first tilt at the senior women's world title. A triple world junior champion last year, the 19-year-old won the Commonwealth Games road race gold medal in August. With eyes on Athens in 2004, her progress will be keenly watched."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
