Kevin Sinfield\u2019s 19-year playing career with the Rhinos featured many memorable moments at Headingley but his first outing as a coach here will arguably rank as one of his more frustrating evenings. Leeds\u2019 record eight-match losing run appeared destined to end when the Rhinos led by eight points with nine minutes remaining: but old habits, it seem, die hard. Kyle Wood\u2019s try, followed by two goals from the boot of Ryan Hampshire, ensured there would be no winning return to Headingley for Sinfield \u2013 with this the third time in less than a month Leeds have collapsed from a winning position to drop a point. At least they arrested their losing run, which gave Sinfield something to hold on to. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite ready to win yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after that showing, we\u2019re on track and can fix things up.\u201d Wakefield would have arguably been favourites to finish ninth had they lost here - but this dramatic fightback alleviates the pressure on them without doubt. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the point,\u201d their coach, Chris Chester said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re all about.\u201d In a game with the stakes so high it was perhaps no surprise neither side produced their best all evening \u2013 but the greater moments of promise in the first half came from the hosts. They led 18-12 thanks to tries for Ryan Hall, Ash Handley and Richie Myler: and, given their dominance, they should have been further ahead. As it was, Wakefield made them pay. All Leeds could muster after half-time was a penalty from the boot of Liam Sutcliffe and, while this was undoubtedly an improved effort from Leeds, Wakefield produced a compelling fightback to deny them victory. First, Wood claimed his own kick which Hampshire converted - before the scrum-half added a late penalty of his own in the final moments to secure a point.
