In the coastal north there are generally two seasons - a hot and cloudless 'dry' season from April to November, and a 'wet' season, where temperatures and humidity can rise to unbearable levels. If you want to visit the interior, try the transitional months - April and June or October and November. Getting there Flight prices are highest at Christmas and in January, when an average ticket costs more than \u00a31,000. But bargain fares are often announced around Boxing Day for travel between April and June. The website www.australiatravelmarket.com monitors fares and says that Malaysian Airlines and Thomas Cook have the best fares over the next 11 months (with returns in May from Heathrow starting at \u00a3516). Qantas and Travelbag have the cheapest prices from Manchester (with departures in May and June from \u00a3625). Getting around Most visitors used to buy air passes through UK travel agents, but the advent of low-cost airlines in Australia means it's often cheaper just to book on the internet. Virgin Blue (www.virginblue.com.au), Qantas (http://www.qantas.com.au/regions/dyn/) and Qantas's low-cost subsidiary Jetstar (www.jetstarasia.com) all offer cheap flights within Australia. Webjet Travel (http://www.webjet.com.au/) features flights with all of these airlines and allows you to book multi-centre itineraries. As with the UK-based low-cost airlines, the earlier you book, the cheaper the fare. Qantas (www.qantas.com.au) also offers a Dreamtime Plus fare, which includes flights from the UK plus a number of discounted internal flights. A London-Melbourne-Brisbane-Melbourne-London flight, for example, costs \u00a3815 from 15 April to 16 June, compared with \u00a3694 for just the international leg. Currency In 2001, the value of the Australian dollar hit an all-time low when it was worth just 26p. Since then, it has crept back up to around 40p but UK visitors will still find that their pounds go a long way, particularly with the low cost of food and drink. It's often cheaper to eat out than to cook yourself. At the time of writing, \u00a31 = AU$2.47. British passport holders who want to visit for up to three months can get an ETA - Electronic Travel Authority - for AU$20, and this is usually handled by the airline, agent or tour operator you book with. If not, you can apply online at www.eta.immi.gov.au (payment by credit card only). If you are not eligible for an ETA, you must pay AU$70 to apply for a visa, which usually takes up to 48 hours to process. For longer tourist stays - six months or a year - visa applications also cost $70. See www.immi.gov.au for more information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
