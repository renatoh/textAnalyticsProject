The Wimbledon centre court roof is not due to be ready for two years yet but already the All England club, after years of being the brunt of rain jokes and snide comments from the French and the Americans alike, is beginning to feel rather smug. Understandably there were few joys of spring in evidence here. Roger Federer, the world No1, stepped out on the centre court for the first time, resplendent in turquoise, although the cold, dank, grey conditions were not such as to instil in him, or most of the spectators, more than the merest hint of enjoyment. When play was called off he led Michael Russell of the United States 6-4, 4-1, which was about the only aspect that pleased him as he set off on the seven-match journey he hopes will lead to his first-ever French Open title a week on Sunday. The only men's match to be completed saw Nikolay Davydenko, the fourth seed, defeat Italy's Stefano Galvani 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. Like Marat Safin on Sunday, here was another rushing Russian. Venus Williams, like her sister Serena the previous day, reached the second round. It is the first time that the two sisters have managed this together at a grand slam tournament since the US Open in 2005, a record indicative of the amount of tennis, for various reasons, they have both missed in recent times. A wrist injury caused Venus not to play this year's Australian Open, which Serena won in such remarkable style, and it has continued to trouble her on and off. These days she tends to talk rather more of staying healthy than anything else, although she was obviously pleased to get past a potentially awkward first-round match against France's Alize Cornet, a highly promising teenager. That said, Venus remains an intimidating sight when she is in full flow, although these days her young opponents are rather less likely to be muscled out of things than they were five or more years ago. Cornet, only 17, was far from intimidated and hit some cracking shots of her own, enough to suggest she may be a top-10 player in the making. On this occasion Williams simply had too much match experience at this level. The nearest Williams has come to winning the title here, on a surface than really does not suit her rangy movement, was in 2002 when she lost to Serena in the final. Otherwise she has not gone beyond the last eight here. While wanting to do as well as possible, her main goal will be Wimbledon, where she has won three of her five slam titles, the last being two years ago. \"It's important to stay positive because things happen,\" she said, which has always served as the Williams sisters' motto. Write them off, send out the negative vibes, and they spring back time and time again, as Serena did so marvellously in Melbourne this year, where she won an improbable eighth grand slam from a ranking of No81. Venus has suffered some tough losses this year on the women's tour, defeats that might suggest, as she approaches her 27th birthday next month, she is a fading force on the circuit. She remains phlegmatic though. \"I'm a winner, so losing is like a foreign feeling. I definitely expect just as much from myself, and still have the same big game,\" Williams said. \"I always want the ultimate result, which is holding the trophy. I'm no different than anyone else.\" Williams felt she had eased herself into the competition, adding: \"The first round can be like that and I definitely got to hit a lot of balls out there. I was really clear, especially towards the end, on how I wanted to execute my game. I feel like I know what I need to do.\" However, on this occasion neither her forehand nor her serve could be described as in the groove, but then nothing could have been on a day when fans huddled together for warmth in coats and scarves. Global warming? Not in this neck of Paris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
