When England played Wales in Cardiff in March, they fielded a young side with a sense of adventure. Toby Flood was at outside-half, not afraid of trying things in his own half, but with mixed results. England were often turned over before halfway, giving Wales prime attacking chances, but they had to keep looking to attack because their set-pieces were deficient. Saturday was different. England's pack was bolstered by a new front-five, including the return of two veterans, Mark Regan and Simon Shaw, which gave the forwards an average age of nearly 31. The gameplan was totally different from Cardiff: kick for position from your own half and attack in Welsh territory. Even when the game had long been won, Jonny Wilkinson stuck faithfully to the script, booting Wales back to their own line. Tom Rees had been the openside flanker in Cardiff but Joe Worsley, a bigger and slower forward, wore the jersey on Saturday, so England used their two big centres to run narrow channels and create targets for their forwards. With Regan unerringly accurate in his throwing and the props giving nothing away in the scrum, England had the platform to dictate the game and the power in the back-row to pick and go with devastating effect, tactics Ashton will surely employ in their key World Cup group game against South Africa. Their use of the ball behind was often wasteful and seven of the nine tries came from within five metres, but their last, after Dan Hipkiss had turned over the Wales full-back Lee Byrne and Wilkinson kicked into the space for Mathew Tait to score, was the opportunism they need in France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
