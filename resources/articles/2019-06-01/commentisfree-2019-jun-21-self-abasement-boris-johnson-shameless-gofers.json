We have to ask, what with the big man himself only allowed out on an electronic tag for around six minutes\u2019 talking time on the BBC Tory leadership debate. Collectors of vignettes displaying Johnson\u2019s contempt for the public will have enjoyed the spectacle of a takeaway being delivered to his house while the other candidates debated on Channel 4. Encouraging to see him building on his friend David Cameron\u2019s legacy: trotters up even before you\u2019ve screwed the country, instead of only after. The only other sightings of Johnson saw him accompanied by various childminders to vote for himself in a series of progressively apocalypse-beckoning votes in Westminster this week. Eventually, of course, Johnson himself will come for us all. He\u2019s really the Tories\u2019 Papa Lazarou, with his grotesque circus, his free-form gibberish, his expanding collection of wedding rings. And the rest. AND THE REST. For now, though, he is represented by a praetorian guard of beta proxies, who make the rounds of the news programmes for him, interpreting what they think their overlord stands for on questions such as Brexit practicalities, and why you wouldn\u2019t play a meaningful part in your own child\u2019s upbringing. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s a living. But is it a life? Maybe this is what you get into politics for. On the other hand, is there a less self-respecting role in public life than being the guy who goes on the radio to flounder about some other guy\u2019s inability to wear a condom? This is effectively the situation in which hopelessly out-of-his-depth Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer found himself on Monday, repeatedly pressed by Emma Barnett on whether it wasn\u2019t a bit weird that we didn\u2019t know how many children the likely next prime minister would own up to having. Great chance to shine, and let\u2019s hope Johnny gets Johnson\u2019s equivalent of a DSO for it. Number two at defence? Or perhaps you have more admiration for fellow Johnson proxy Kwasi Kwarteng, who appeared on Channel 4 news to fume: \u201cThe idea he is racist is completely ridiculous. To say he is racist is scurrilous, offensive and completely wrong.\u201d I wonder if proxying for Boris feels a bit less unspeakably awful every time they go out and do it. Maybe the proxies get endless free vodka to get them through the horror, like the guys shooting dogs in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Even so, you\u2019ve got to think a lot of this work is going to stay with you for the rest of your life. Asked if he would buy a used car from Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi trilled: \u201cI would buy anything from Boris Johnson!\u201d In that case, I have a garden bridge to sell you. Also some water cannon, and a line about NHS funding. Or how about Matt Hancock? Eleven days ago, Matt launched his own leadership campaign as \u201cthe candidate of the future\u201d, declaring that choosing between Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove would be like \u201casking me to choose between my children\u201d. But it was bad news for the Hancock kiddies, in the end, as Daddy decided to back Boris Johnson instead. Yup, here comes Cuck Rogers, back from the future to delude himself that Johnson has made the same assurances to him as he has to Steve Baker. We must assume the Westminster proxies are all being run by Gavin Williamson, contrary to a welter of reports about 10 minutes ago that Gavin was completely finished in politics. But in the media, Johnson backers such as George Osborne have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile, there is a very particular type of chap who goes in to bat for the Old Etonian Johnson with the somewhat tragic deference of a man who knows his own public school was one of the minor ones. This peculiar type of longing underpins much of the writing of Quentin Letts (Haileybury), with his most recent Sun column a case in point. Here he is on Johnson: \u201cAt an age when some blokes find their virility drooping, he still plainly has some lead in his pencil, with a new and much younger girlfriend \u2026 He has swanned through life breaking the rules, laughing and bonking. That INFURIATES [the elite]!\u201d Always a pleasure to take lectures on \u201cthe establishment\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d and \u201cthe ruling class\u201d from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s highest-paid columnist. And with that, I fear we can avoid the columnist question no longer. I had an instructive online exchange with the aforementioned Johnny Mercer this week, during which he broke the habit of a lunchtime and mentioned his military service, adding in parenthesis \u201c(you were probably writing columns)\u201d. Probably. And I naturally share Johnny\u2019s disdain for newspaper columnists, most especially myself. However, only one of us wants a newspaper columnist to become prime minister. In the end, little encapsulates the stage-four clusterfuck the UK is facing as totally as the fact that it is about to be run by a journalist. And, incredibly, by the worse of the two journalists in the final three. Why are we getting journalists to run anything? What\u2019s the rationale \u2013 that now they\u2019ve torched their own industry, they should be allowed a go on the country? If the past couple of decades have shown us anything, it\u2019s that journalists shouldn\u2019t really have been in charge of even the journalism business. It is far from a coincidence that two of the leading architects of Brexit \u2013 Michael Gove and Johnson \u2013 were both journalists. Is it in any way surprising to find that the UK is very drunk and has already missed two deadlines? As for all Johnson\u2019s proxies and the backers who should know so much better: every one of them must carry the mark of Cain when it goes tits up, as it assuredly will. It\u2019s like the old saying goes: fool me once, shame on you. Fool me literally hundreds of times, shame on me. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
