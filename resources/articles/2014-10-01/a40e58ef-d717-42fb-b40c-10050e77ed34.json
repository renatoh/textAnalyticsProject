The author may once have been Sajit (Michael Karim) \u2013 the youngest of the Khan clan, who observes the cultural confusions of his brothers and sisters from deep inside the parka that he wears like body armour and which he has refused to take off for the past year \u2013 but on stage he becomes George. It\u2019s a beautiful performance in a hugely enjoyable revival: a complex and comic portrait of a man adrift in a changing world, out of touch with his children and attempting to rule his family through fear when all they long to offer in return is love. There is a moment when George stares at the TV watching a report about the war of independence in East Pakistan, and it\u2019s as if he is watching his life flash in front of him. You glimpse the hurt and puzzlement of a man who can\u2019t fathom how he got from there \u2013 new immigrant arriving in the UK in 1936 full of hope and ambition \u2013 to now: fish-and-chip shop owner married to the white Ella (Jane Horrocks on very good form) and father to an increasingly rebellious brood. One of the great pleasures of the play is the way, whatever your cultural background, it tells the truth about family life and the way that love and hate are bound together. When the Khan boys, infuriated by their father\u2019s attempts to marry them off, and his violence towards their mother, suggest that perhaps Ella should divorce George, they fail to recognise that in their own odd way these two people really do love each other. Jane Horrocks\u2019 beautifully judged Ella has a quiet, chirpy strength: a woman who, as her sister Annie (Sally Bankes) observes, may well be saving herself for the battles that lie ahead when her only daughter, Meenah (Taj Atwell), reaches the age where she can be married. Of course, times have changed since the early 1970s when the play was set and also when it was first produced at the Royal Court in 1996. But the confusions over identity and how you define yourself \u2013 Pakistani, British or Muslim \u2013 haven\u2019t gone away, they have simply moved into different, sometimes more treacherous territory. Khan Din\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t play to the disaffections of young British Muslims today, or an increasing need to define themselves by their religion. But with great humour and real theatrical exuberance it explores generational tensions and gently suggests that, however much we revolt against our parents, there is a large chance that, eventually, we will turn into them. Director Sam Yates announces himself as a major talent in a revival, played out on Tom Scutt\u2019s clever, deceptively flexible design, which is pleasingly fluid, utilising all the puppyish exuberance of the younger Khans to create dramatic energy, and which always puts truth before comedy. The payoff is a show that delivers the laughs even as it hurts. \u2022 Until 3 January 2015.
