Then all of a sudden I hear that the Americans can have their stay, the referees can have their stay. . . \" A Fifa spokesman confirmed the eviction order. \u00b7 The high quality of the pitches in South Korea and Japan has been a feature of the tournament so far, but Suwon, which hosts games tomorrow, Wednesday and Sunday, may prove an exception after 15 Fifa officials and 20 from the Korean organisers spent yesterday afternoon lumbering around it in a \"fun\" friendly. Stadium managers were horrified and say it takes four days for the grass to recover. \"I think it shows the Fifa officials' high-handed attitude,\" said one employee of the management company, whose experience of Fifa suits is clearly limited. \u00b7 Rotund cocaine fiend Diego Maradona has put pen to paper to console Argentina's distraught squad. \"You're going to hoist our blue-and-white flag as I once did. I want you to know I will never abandon you,\" writes the man sent home from USA '94 after failing a drugs test. Maradona is expected to be pitchside for Wednesday's match against Sweden after the Japanese authorities relented and allowed him into the country despite first refusing him because of his drug convictions. \u00b7 Lament of the day from Eduardo Galeano, Uruguayan writer and all-round egghead: \"We're ploughing on with more pain than glory. No spirit, no goals, no touch, no style, no audacity. With this mediocre and miserable football it will take a miracle for us to go through. The problem is that God is busy with other things and even He's bored of watching us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
