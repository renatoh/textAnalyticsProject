The hotel, known originally as the Federal McKinlay Hotel, was moved 400 metres after the film was shot so that passing tourists could find it more easily. Its owners have made sure the pub has retained its original outback feel, despite being the town's main (well, only) tourist attraction. If you're in the Northern Territory, meanwhile, make sure you stop off at the equally famous Daly Waters Pub, 90 kilometres south of Larrimah, which has held a 'gallon licence' since 1893. A refuelling stop for Qantas Singapore flights in the 1930s, it's bursting with memorabilia, including women's underwear pinned to the walls. What's the quickest way to fly to Australia? Flying to Australia involves a stopover, but there are a number of options to choose from. With Qantas and British Airways, the quickest end-to-end route from London to Sydney is via Singapore, with a total journey time of just over 21 hours and 15 minutes, including 1 hour and 20 minutes on the ground at Singapore. Following closely behind are flights via Bangkok, which take 21 hours and 40 minutes, including 1 hour and 30 minutes on the ground. To travel via Hong Kong, you'd need to change planes in Hong Kong, but the total journey time is still only 22 hours and 10 minutes, including 1 hour and 5 minutes on the ground. Travelling via Los Angeles, however, is significantly longer, with a journey time of 29 hours and 50 minutes, including 4 hours and 20 minutes on the ground. Qantas also offers flights via Tokyo, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai and, although these don't have such good connections, they are becoming popular with travellers looking for new stopover options. Virgin flies via Hong Kong and the total journey time is 22 hours and 40 minutes, with 1 hour and 30 minutes on the ground. What should you do if you're bitten by a deadly spider Australia is home to two spiders with potentially fatal bites: the Sydney funnel-web and the small redback. The first is black, stocky and, as its name suggests, is found in the Sydney area. The latter, a relative of the notoriously dangerous black widow, is usually found in dark, dry locations and is less common in colder regions such as Tasmania. Both are prolific in January and February, when there is a greater risk of being bitten. If you are bitten by the funnel-web, use a crepe bandage to bind the affected limb and splint it as if it were a sprain to slow the flow of venom into the lymphatic system. Do not clean the bite area, as venom on the skin can help doctors identify the species of your attacker. If you are bitten by a redback, apply ice to relieve the pain. In both cases, get to hospital or seek medical attention immediately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
