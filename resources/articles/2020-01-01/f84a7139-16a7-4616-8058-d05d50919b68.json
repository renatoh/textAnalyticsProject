Negotiations with the Belgian champions are continuing, although it is understood that Villa have agreed to pay \u00a38.5m to buy the 27-year-old. Dean Smith has been desperate to bolster his striking options after Wesley was ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury and with Villa having dropped into the relegation zone after last week\u2019s heavy defeat by Manchester City. Samatta, who would become the first Tanzanian player to move to the Premier League, has still to agree personal terms, although that is not believed to be a major stumbling block. He must also be granted a work permit, a process not necessarily straightforward with his country ranked 134th in the world by Fifa, meaning Villa must apply for special dispensation. However Samatta should have a good chance of being granted a permit after finishing as the top scorer in Belgium last season and becoming the first east African to win the coveted Soulier d\u2019\u00c9b\u00e8ne award for the best African or African-origin player in the Belgian Pro League. Even if Villa land Samatta, they are keen to bring in another striker and they have an interest in Islam Slimani, who is on loan at Monaco from Leicester but is open to a mid-season move. Slimani has scored seven times this season, including against Paris St-Germain last Sunday. Samatta, who came to Belgium from TP Mazembe in 2016, scored in Genk\u2019s Champions League defeat at Liverpool in November and had also been tracked by Brighton, Crystal Palace and Norwich in the January transfer window. Villa face a race against time to ensure Samatta is available for Saturday\u2019s trip to Brighton, and Smith admitted that with the 21-year-old back-up striker Keinan Davis sidelined time was of the essence. \u201cI\u2019m calm and confident we will get players but we have big games and if we don\u2019t get one in by Saturday it\u2019ll be the third in a row without a recognised striker,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we do the best we can. There is a necessity there. With Wesley getting injured and Keinan being out we have to strengthen massively ... January is even harder without recognised strikers as clubs can stick prices up a bit. It always has been a tough window ... There\u2019ll be a big boost to whole squad when we get one in and we\u2019re working hard to do that.\u201d Villa\u2019s only fit striker, Jonathan Kodjia, is set to leave before Saturday\u2019s trip to Brighton. Qatari side Al Gharafa, who are managed by Slavisa Jokanovic, have announced the 30-year-old will undergo a medical on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
