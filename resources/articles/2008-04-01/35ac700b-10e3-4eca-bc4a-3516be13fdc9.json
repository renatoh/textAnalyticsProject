Under his real name of Royston Vasey, Brown owns Rasaman with North Yorkshire trainer Kevin Ryan. Brown - sporting a bright red suit and trilby - was at Thirsk on Friday to see his horse finish a well-beaten 13th of 14 runners in the 4.15. Despite his absence from television, proceeds from Brown's latest DVD - The Good, The Bad and the Fat Bastard - should help to pay for Rasaman's 25,000 guineas purchase price plus his training fees for this season. Sandown at the movies again Matt Damon (below) has been at Sandown shooting scenes for his new film Green Zone, but it is by no means the track's only cinematic moment of fame. Eagle-eyed viewers of the 1990 movie Nuns On The Run will have spotted that the airport check-in desks were Sandown's Tote betting windows as Robbie Coltrane ran up a racecourse escalator wearing a nun's outfit. The comedy film also starred Monty Python's Eric Idle. Spencer's fashion statements A press release from Haydock last Sunday announcing a link-up between Jamie Spencer and the Harvey Nichols department stores included an upbeat quote from the champion jockey about his new career as a model. 'I am thrilled to be associated with the Harvey Nichols brand and Haydock Park, a first-class racecourse. Fashion is part of the genetics of racing and it's great to see an innovative approach to adding value to the racegoer's experience,' read Spencer's quote. The Irishman offered a slightly different stance when asked for his view on his new role in that day's Racing Post. 'My career as a male model started and ended that day,' he said. 'It was so boring. On the other hand, I got paid a lot for it and it was better than an afternoon at Wolverhampton.' Gosden's young at heart John Gosden's mobile phone ringtone may show he has been dragged into the 21st century by his son, but the Newmarket trainer still hankers for yesteryear. Talking to a huddle of journalists at last week's Craven meeting, Gosden's phone burst into a rendition of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 'Californication'. 'My son downloaded this for me, but I am much more of a Neil Young man,' Gosden explained. 'I went to see him the other week at the Hammersmith Apollo and it was just wonderful. The Apollo can only hold about 2,000 people, the acoustics were amazing and it was a concert to die for.' What's in a name? Slugger O'Toole, a most promising fourth on his reappearance at Newmarket last Wednesday for Barry Hills, is named after a character in the folk song 'Irish Rover', which is about a 19th century cargo ship that meets a sticky end. The song, made more popular by The Pogues (lead singer Shane MacGowan pictured), makes reference to many of the ship's crew, including 'Slugger O'Toole, who was drunk as a rule'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
