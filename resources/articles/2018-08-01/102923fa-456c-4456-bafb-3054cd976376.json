Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. In uncharacteristically bright yellow light, we see Serena gently washing a baby. She looks entirely happy as she calls the tiny girl \u201cmy sweet Nicole\u201d. While the sun has finally come out for Mrs Waterford, Offred is back at the Red Centre, in a harness, pumping milk from her reluctant breast, the separation from Holly slowly killing her. Lydia tells Offred that several households are making overtures for her services next and that one commander\u2019s wife has sent muffins as a form of bribery. The mother\u2019s milk dries up as Offred detaches herself mentally from the baby. It is about survival only now. She cannot afford to feel the howling pain inside. That meeting set up by Fred causes her milk to leak involuntarily, something that can be physically painful, reflecting the distress she is trying so hard to squash. It is only a matter of time before Serena has to admit the handmaid back into her home. In many ways, things really cheered up this week. But the highlight of the episode was the arrival of Bradley Whitford. Yes, Josh from The West Wing turned out to be Commander Lawrence: the evil architect of the Colonies and Emily\u2019s new posting. He is incredibly hard to read and talks out of turn about the regime, but still wields his power over the handmaid in a way that suggests he does not entirely hate his station in life. He appears to be testing her. I have high hopes for him. Back at the Waterfords, Eden and Offred\u2019s tender chat in the kitchen is a generous act from the handmaid, but her advice to \u201cgrab love\u201d wherever she can find it proves catastrophic. Eden\u2019s journey is a bit hard to credit, what with her being so devout. I know hormones are strong in the young, but would she really have run off like that, knowing she would incur the wrath of her parents and God? The scene between Nick and June shortly afterwards pricks the new mother\u2019s carefully constructed bubble of emotional protection. Nick\u2019s \u201cOur baby\u2019s so beautiful\u201d catches her unawares and she breaks down a little. He daydreams that they should run away to Hawaii together, their little family. Fred bursts in on their happiness and says that Isaac isn\u2019t at his post. Nick knows Eden wasn\u2019t in bed when he woke, either. The house is in uproar and the baby won\u2019t settle. My heart did go out to Serena (sort of) when she tried to sooth Nicole with her own empty breast. But then I remembered she is a deluded rapist and thought better of it. Fred and June\u2019s awkward encounter sees them return to their holding pattern of power brokering. Unbelievably, he still wants her sexually and tries to negotiate a bonus for all the contact she has been allowed with her children. She offers him a game of Scrabble and he leaves. Is he actually kidding? Emily settles uneasily into her new surroundings, trying to work out if Lawrence is a dangerous maniac or an ally in this insane world she is forced to live in. His wife rants hysterically about his work, the Colonies, her own misery. He certainly doesn\u2019t treat her that nicely. Then comes the inevitable tying-up of Eden\u2019s storyline. It was always going to end this way, from the moment the two youngsters smiled nervously at one another. Amazing how a society that so prizes children and young people as representative of hope can so easily dispose of them when they transgress. Eden and Isaac are standing on the high diving board as the charges are read out, heavy weights attached to their ankles. \u201cPlead for his mercy,\u201d says the preachers as they lock eyes and Eden begins to quote to herself: \u201cLove is patient, love is kind.\u201d Their needless deaths, in front of an audience of distraught onlookers, is just another dreadful indictment of a dictatorship hell-bent on absolute control. Even a person\u2019s sexual urges are policed by the state. It is never mentioned who ultimately controls Gilead. I guess it is not necessary, but that must be one charismatic leader they are all blindly following. In the aftermath, the whole household is cast into misery as the rain pours outside. In another unlikely turn of events, Serena relents and allows Offred to feed her child. Cruelty is so easily interchanged with kindness in this house: Fred and Serena ease Offred\u2019s suffering when it suits them, but they are only ever a hair\u2019s breadth away from out-and-out malice. The sound of music No contemporary music this week, just the atmospheric compositions of Adam Taylor. Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Grim scale The merciless dispatch of the young lovers brings this episode up to a hard-to-watch seven. Under his eye I loved Rita mentioning that Serena changes the baby\u2019s outfit every 10 minutes, seeing Nicole as a prized possession, rather than a little life in her own right. Fred\u2019s request for more \u201cthanks\u201d might not have been forthcoming if he had known what Offred was doing as she watched him and Serena in the empty house last week. With one episode to go, there is going to have to be some swift narrative work to get Offred anywhere near to the brink of escape again. Perhaps this series won\u2019t end on such a cliffhanger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
