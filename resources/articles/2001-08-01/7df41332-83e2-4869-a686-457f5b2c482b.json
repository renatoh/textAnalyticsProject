Despite Cole's prolific striking rate for Manchester United over the past six seasons and Yorke's apparent renaissance over the pre-season, Ferguson disclosed that neither of the two attackers who played in the 1999 Champions League final will be first choices in his final season as manager. Instead it is Ferguson's intention, he revealed, to abandon the 4-4-2 system he has used so religiously over the past 15 years and switch to 4-4-1-1, with Juan Sebastian Veron - who will miss tomorrow's Charity Shield because of international duty with Argentina - alongside Roy Keane in the centre of midfield and Paul Scholes pushed forward to fill the \"hole\" behind Ruud van Nistelrooy. \"This is the system I will be using this season, particularly in our most important games. I think it's the way to go,\" said Ferguson. \"It's a different way of doing things but it excites me. \"Scholes is one of the best finishers in the game. His record for England and with us in Europe shows he can play at the highest level. He has a great knack of getting into the penalty area and that is an asset we need to utilise. \"I think he and Ruud will gel. Van Nistelrooy is always looking to find space. There is no one better in the game. He has been fantastic so far.\" On other occasions Ferguson will switch to 4-3-2-1, the Christmas tree formation, with Ryan Giggs given a more advanced position alongside Scholes. For Cole and Yorke, not to mention Nicky Butt and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, it is inevitable that there will be disappointments ahead. All four have made significant commitments to stay at Old Trafford since the turn of the year, Yorke verbally and the other three by signing new contracts. However, it is clear that they will have only bit parts as Ferguson aims to end his 16-year tenure by returning the European Cup to Old Trafford. It is a situation to which Butt and Solskjaer have gradually become accustomed in recent seasons but it will be a new phenomenon for Cole, while Yorke's fine pre-season form had given him renewed hope of playing a key role. Only time will tell how Cole, in particular, reacts to being relegated to the bench, but Ferguson emphasised the benefits of his bloated squad. \"We won't be using Ruud in every game,\" he said. \"There will be times when we give him a rest and revert to two strikers. That will mean all the others get plenty of football.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
