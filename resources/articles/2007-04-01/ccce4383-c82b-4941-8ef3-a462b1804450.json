Landmines and chemical and biological weapons have already been outlawed through treaties. Nuclear weapons can be similarly abolished through a nuclear-weapons convention. At a review of the non-proliferation treaty in 2000, the five original nuclear weapon states made an \"unequivocal undertaking\" to \"accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament\". Despite this, the UK parliament has voted to replace the Trident submarine-based nuclear-weapon system after announcing its intention in 2006 to spend just over \u00a31bn over the next three years on refurbishing key facilities at its nuclear-weapons complex at Aldermaston. Today there are 27,000 nuclear weapons in the world, owned by nine countries, all of which have stated their preparedness to use them. Nuclear weapons have no legitimate purpose; not only are they illegal (civilian casualties are unavoidable), they are also genocidal and utterly immoral. Nuclear weapons are futile against any of today's real security threats: they cannot address climate change, poverty, hunger, overpopulation, non-state armed groups or terrorists, and they are useless against pandemics such as Aids or avian flu. Immediate survivors in the vicinity of any nuclear exchange face devastating long-term ill effects or death. The hypocritical claim that nuclear weapons are valuable instruments in some hands, but intolerable threats when owned by others, must be abandoned. The government should support a nuclear-weapons convention as part of the non-proliferation treaty process. We will be lobbying for the convention at an NPT meeting in Vienna starting on April 30.
