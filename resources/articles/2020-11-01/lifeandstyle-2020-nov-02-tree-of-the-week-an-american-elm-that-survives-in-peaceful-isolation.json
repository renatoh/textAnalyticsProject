Why? \u201cThis tree is a survivor,\u201d he says. \u201cLike many old American elms, it\u2019s located in an isolated place where Dutch elm disease couldn\u2019t get to it.\u201d The elm, which Kaufman estimates to be about 150 years old, stands in the middle of a field against the backdrop of the Berkshire Hills in western Massachusetts. It\u2019s 95 miles from the nearest urban area, the small town of Egremont. Kaufman says that if you position yourself in a certain way, you can get a clear view of the tree with no evidence of human presence in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s only when I photograph the tree that I realise how alone it really is. It\u2019s very peaceful,\u201d he says. He first saw the elm in 2002, when he was staying with a friend at his holiday home in the Berkshires. \u201cHe suggested we drive up to see it as it\u2019s a bit of a famous tree locally. I had a patient who was a farmer in the town and we would discuss the tree and the surrounding farms.\u201d The elm left an impression on Kaufman and he began to stop by at every opportunity. \u201cI was lucky in that the tree was en route whenever I went to visit my family in Copake, New York. It\u2019s always a worthwhile diversion and I now have more than 100 photos of the tree in all seasons, some of which were good enough to give to others as gifts.\u201d Above all, Kaufman is thankful that the elm has survived to be appreciated. \u201cAnyone can see it, anyone can walk up to it. American elms aren\u2019t the most colourful, but this one doesn\u2019t need to be bright to be special. Its joy lies in the fact that it\u2019s hiding in plain sight.\u201d \u2022 Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
