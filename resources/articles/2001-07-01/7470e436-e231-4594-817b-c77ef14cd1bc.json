On Monday the new Electoral Commission told them that Parliament 'needs to address, urgently and radically, the decline in public participation'. The bare facts are indeed awful. The 2000 Euro elections drew less than 24 per cent to the polls, and at the general election last month turnout slumped to 59 per cent. The 1997 election poll, even though the lowest since the Second World War, was a fifth higher than on 7 June. As a result, Labour's massive majority rests on the support of less than one in four of the electorate. So, should we be hitting the panic button? Some will console themselves by saying that we always have low turnouts for EU elections, and that last month many people were content with the status quo and confident of a Labour win. They add that voting is declining everywhere, that major policy differences are few and political personalities even fewer. The counter view is that the body politic is sicker than the above facts indicate. Best estimates point to as few as 15 per cent of under 25s polling in the Euro elections and less than two in five of that age group doing so on 7 June. Worse, research by Mori last year and the commission this year found that no fewer than 29-40 per cent of that age group had not even registered to vote despite being the most educated such cohort since voting began. Having canvassed for the last 36 years (and fought five elections), I never remember such 'doorstep droop' as this time. Rather than the 'vigour and cheerfulness of allegiance', which was John Pym's recipe for a healthy democracy, there was resignation and disconnectedness. Few voters any longer have a committed political abode. Yet this seems not to be born of apathy so much as of antipathy deriving from a sense of civic insignificance and powerlessness. Also, many MPs have lost caste, and are viewed more as lobby fodder than real representatives. Professor Bernard Crick's Citizenship committee in 1998 reported 'worrying levels of apathy, ignorance and cynicism about public life'. Last month the Carnegie Trust report on youth involvement in public life found that 'young people need to feel they are having a tangible influence', which they certainly do not. The Bradford Working Group - with ironic timing, it published its report a few days before the riots there - similarly concluded that 'people at street level rarely are told what is going on by politicians or leaders'. A fortnight ago, the Parekh Report on 'The Future of Multi Ethnic Britain' observed that 'political parties are more interested in ethnic minorities votes than their opinions' while noting the emergence of a general underclass 'whose deepening exclusion is a matter of shame for the whole nation'. There are also powerful materialist influences behind our democratic recession. Perhaps global warming has its political equivalent; what one might call democratic cooling. The uncomfortable fact is that both predicaments at least partly result from infectious aspects of today's capitalism, such as insatiability, limited morality and absolute self centredness. The demands made of those in business are more totalitarian and exclusive than they have ever been. The old antidotes, socialism and Christianity, are dead or dying. Indeed, it increasingly seems (and not just to anti-capitalist demonstrators) that the values of global capitalism are often at odds with those of democracy, and seem to be winning. Take commitment. Democracy cannot do without it. Allegiance to community, political parties, law and order and Parliament, are at its heart. Many modern businesses, by contrast, travel exceedingly light, particularly in the financial services sector, their only reliable commitment being to their directors and shareholders. The modern multinationals are footloose, and not above threatening relocation or disinvestment, for example, when governments are reluctant to do their bidding. One striking aspect of this loyalty-free mentality, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world, is the extent to which the identity of company ownership is viewed, and not just by the markets, almost indifferently. Companies here are bought and sold like casino chips, often with as much sentiment. With all this comes a mobile managerial class, where even company loyalty is increasingly skin-deep. Then there is competitiveness. Ultimately good politics, like good families, thrive on cooperation and commonality. In the corporate world the cry is for ever more competitiveness, with Labour as evangelistic for it as the Tories. The fact that modern economics apparently dictates such a one-eyed creed only highlights our predicament. The spillover of this ethic into politics encourages, inter alia, the yah-boo duelling at the Commons dispatch box, which has had an insidious effect upon public attitudes to politics as a whole. Then again, the culture of corporatist managerialism now dominates politics. In a world where diversity is celebrated, nothing so alienates people as the fact that not a single vote went against the Government during its first four years in office. Even the so-called revolt over select committees two weeks ago was on a free vote. These machine politics have made possible Westminster's torrential legislation - thousands upon thousands of pages every year - which is so baffling, demoralising and self-defeating. To all this must be added the relentless concentration of power in Whitehall, which has not only belittled local democracy and discouraged the best from leading it, but has fostered a dirigisme which has resulted in resentful dependence. The British preference has hitherto been to allow local people to make their own mistakes in their own way and to learn in the process, rather than being more and more regulated from the centre. Now, indeed, is the time for all good people to come to the aid of democracy. There is no country on Earth more beholden to it. \u0095 Lord Phillips of Sudbury is a Liberal Democrat life peer and a solicitor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
