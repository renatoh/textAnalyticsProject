He had admitted failing to provide a breath sample. Falkirk sheriff court heard that guards at the Ineos plant called police after Joyce, the Falkirk MP and a former army major, approached the gatehouse at about 11.15pm on Thursday. The duty solicitor, Willie McIntyre, said that Joyce was embarrassed by the incident, adding that \"his party is not going to be at all happy about what happened\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
