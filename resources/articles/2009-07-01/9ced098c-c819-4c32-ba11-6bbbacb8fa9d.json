He became, so far as anyone can work out, the youngest ever first-team professional footballer in South America, or anywhere else where people write these things down. His appearance brought attention from across the world and anger from his opponents, one of whom marked the occasion by chopping him down with a neat kick to the back of the calf. On Wednesday, after the attention of the world's media had shifted elsewhere, Baldivieso was asked if he had anything to add about the game. \"I want to clarify,\" the youngster said, \"that I did not cry when I was fouled. Some people said that I cried, but that's a lie and they're just jealous.\" For all his alleged maturity, Baldivieso's age could barely have been more obvious if he'd just blown out 13 candles on a novelty birthday cake decorated to resemble a football pitch while all the grown-ups in the squad were forced to applaud and sing happy birthday. Which, incidentally, he had. It probably helped that his dad was the manager. \"He played football in his mother's belly,\" cooed Julio Cesar Baldivieso, a former Bolivia international. \"We had an ultrasound scan which showed him kicking in the stomach of his mother. He has always been playing this sport.\" Then on Thursday, after being told to drop the minor midfielder, Julio quit. \"I'm not going to be told whether I play someone from my family or not,\" he sniffed. It's hard to think of any manager talking up a family member's footballing abilities quite so blatantly, at least since Tottenham's Harry Redknapp declared that \"my missus could have scored\" when Darren Bent skied a sitter in January. Sporting success is generally earned rather than bestowed as some kind of birthday gift \u2013 though Mauricio's was, to be fair, an awesome present, and a lot cheaper than a Nintendo Wii. It has been quite a week for sporting children and their fathers. We've seen all kinds of dads, some who deliver opportunities to their blessed bairns and others who are just cheerleaders, albeit cheerleaders who can't dance or sing and have to shave a lot more than most. It started last Sunday when 16-year-old Matteo Manassero won the silver medal as the Open's leading amateur and his father Roberto, quite endearingly, bounced about behind the ropes as if someone had exchanged his feet for pogo sticks and he had no idea what to do about it. And it ends tomorrow in Hungary, when Jaime Alguersuari Jr will become Formula One's youngest-ever driver at the age of 19 years and 125 days. He has spent most of this year driving in the World Series by Renault, a competition run by a Spanish motorsports mogul by the name of Jaime Alguersuari Sr. The youngster can drive as fast as he likes, he won't leave those accusations of nepotism behind. \"My father has been very important,\" he protested, \"but the one who has to drive the car is me.\" And in between, in Rome, Rob Daley broke into a press conference after his 15-year-old diving prodigy of a son, Tom, had won gold at the World Swimming Championships, ignored the fact that his mobile phone was repeatedly playing Yakety Sax \u2013 the music Benny Hill used to chase busty blondes to \u2013 and, in front of the world's media, begged his humiliated son to \"come and give me a cuddle, please, please, please, give me a cuddle\". \"If every athlete was 15, I wouldn't do it,\" said Rob later. And it's true that not every athlete in Rome is 15: some, like Tanzania's juvenile backstroke marvel Gaori Jayesh Kumar Kotecha, are 12. It's his son's ability, rather than just his age, which sets him apart these days. It is only fair for a father to follow his son's sporting progress \u2013 and occasionally, if he can, to lead it \u2013 but the fact they've brought up a sporting prodigy doesn't make it all right when they bring up my bile. Some fathers have the power to manoeuvre their child into the spotlight, others seem desperate to steal some of it for themselves, but perhaps, all things considered, the best place for a parent's pride is in private."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
