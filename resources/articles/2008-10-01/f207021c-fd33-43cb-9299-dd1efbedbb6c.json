The charities said the government was legally bound by promises it made in legislation passed in 2000, in which it undertook to abolish fuel poverty by 2016 and to eliminate it among the most vulnerable households by 2010. The hearing is scheduled to last two days, with a judgment expected within six weeks. Households in fuel poverty are defined as those in which more than 10% of income is spent on energy. But far from the numbers falling, the past year has seen a steep increase as gas and electricity bills have rocketed. Official figures last week showed that in 2006 3.5m households - 1m more than in 2005 - spent more than a 10th of their income on heating and power. The figure included 2.75m \"vulnerable\" households, such as those with children, elderly people or the long-term sick. Since then, Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth said the situation had deteriorated dramatically, following several hikes in tariffs by the major power suppliers. They estimate that as many as 5m households, many of them those of pensioners, now face a stark choice of \"heat or eat\". Mervyn Kohler, special adviser for Help the Aged, said: \"Though fuel poverty is high on the media and political agendas, government actions to reduce it fall far short of the crisis it is creating for millions of pensioners and low-income families. \"It is vital that the government comes up with an effective strategy for tackling fuel poverty. Low-income households need crisis payments simply to get through the coming winter, but in the longer term, the energy efficiency of our homes must be improved. The government has a legal duty to do this.\" The charities argue that the government has broken the law by not doing everything reasonably practicable to meet its fuel poverty targets. They claim the government has failed to provide a comprehensive and costed plan of action for meeting its targets; failed to set a minimum standard of energy efficiency for affected households, and ignored repeated criticism from the independent Fuel Poverty Advisory Group. Hilary Benn, environment minister, said the government was committed to tackling fuel poverty but \"sharply rising energy prices have made that goal increasingly difficult\". The government said tackling fuel poverty was a high-priority policy and that it had pledged \u00a31bn to help struggling householders. Since 2000, \u00a320bn had been spent on a range of benefits and programmes to improve fuel efficiency and help those in need of assistance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
