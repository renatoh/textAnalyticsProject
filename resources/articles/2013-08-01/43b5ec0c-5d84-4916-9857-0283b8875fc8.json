Surely some error", "bodyText": "\u2022 Blimey! A little creative accountancy by the Scots Nats, who have just calculated that, following the latest appointees to the House of Lords such as the billionaire earth-mover Sir Anthony \"JCB\" Bamford and Doreen Lawrence, Scots elect only 4% of the UK parliament. It's a scandal, though some would say the SNP have only themselves to blame: they, too, could nominate folks to hop on the Westminster train if they wanted to while the folk back home make up their minds about whether to go it alone next year. One of their Westminster outriders, Angus MacNeil, MP for what used to be called the Western Isles but is now more poetically known as Na h-Eileanan an Iar, denounces the wicked discrimination. \"We now have a ludicrous situation that \u2026 people in Scotland elect only 4% of parliamentarians who hold powers over the economy, welfare, defence \u2026 and many other crucial areas of policy.\" This sleight of hand is done by adding up the peers to the Commons, of course. Truly, never was PG Wodehouse's great aphorism more applicable: \"It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.\" Nice silly season try by the SNP, anyway. \u2022 Hold on just a sec, though. At the last count there were 5.2 million Scots in a population of 63.2 million Brits, so that's 8.3%; but there are 59 Scottish MPs in a chamber of 650 \u2026 which means (gets out calculator\u2026) 9.076% of the total. Hmmm. And what, pray, is the number of Scottish prime ministers? Fourteen out of 53 \u2026 so 26.4%. OK, so that includes a few English chaps such as Gladstone and Asquith who sat for Scottish seats, and one or two ersatz Scots such as Tony Blair and David Cameron (he must have a wee dram of the Highlands in there somewhere) \u2013 but then it also numbers Ramsay MacDonald, who was undoubtedly Scottish but sat for Aberavon. Ach, it all gets a bit complicated \u2013 maybe we need an economist: what's Alex Salmond doing? \u2022 Speaking of the former Great Helmsman \u2013 ACL Blair, that is \u2013 this particular stand-in diarist (Hugh Muir's on holiday this week, so you're stuck with me) was clearing out the loft the other day when I came across a pile of university theatre programmes from shows I saw as an undergraduate in the 1970s. They include one Tony Blair in a small role in Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera, of all things, at the Oxford Playhouse in June 1974. The Marxist German playwright's influence on the dialectical development of the future prime minister seems unaccountably to have been written out, but perhaps Brecht's idea that the representation of reality is not reality itself may somehow have rubbed off. Perhaps it was Blair's Red Tony period, or was that just an ugly rumour? Mary Honeyball, now a Labour MEP, was also in the cast. Sadly, I have absolutely no memory of the production by the St John's College Mummers, nor of his Tonyship's seminal performance as Matt. Perhaps others do. \u2022 Here's a Daily Mail strapline: \"Are you thinking what Jan Moir's thinking?\" Possibly not; and if you were, why would you need to read her? A touch of the unsuccessful 2005 Tory election manifesto there. Funny \u2013 the Mail doesn't usually adopt losing slogans. \u2022 If you were a fan of the plumptious and occasionally baroque ratiocinations of the late, great Frank Keating, which adorned the Guardian's sports pages \u2013 especially on cricket and rugby \u2013 for many years until Frank's death last January, you won't want to miss an evening of memories at London University's senate house on 20 August. A few tickets remain, and the evening will be joyous and full of anecdotes from diverse assembled undignatories. Will they tell the one about the night when Frank was locked out of his hotel in Bath? Big row with the night porter who wouldn't let him have his room key. Manager summoned in the middle of the night. Ongoing row, satisfaction demanded. Sheepish Frank next morning: he did have the right room number, it transpired. Just the wrong hotel. \"Still,\" said Frank. \"It's a tale to tell.\" And maybe they will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
