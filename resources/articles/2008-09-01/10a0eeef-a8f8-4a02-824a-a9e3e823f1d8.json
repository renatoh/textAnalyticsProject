Yet distilling the spirit of an age into one novel is no mean feat. In too many books, the inclusion of iPods and texting, and any other so-called signifier of modern life, seems to come from a mistaken belief that they offer instant access to the zeitgeist. The technological trappings of the 21st century are not, however, interesting in fiction for their mere presence, but rather for the insights they give us into the way characters \u2013 and by extension, we - live. Email, for example, has lent the epistolary novel a whole new dimension, as Matt Beaumont proved in 2000 with e. (Sad though that we'll never know what Samuel Richardson would have made of it.) More often than not though, Blackberries and the like stick out in contemporary novels like ungainly flags desperately claiming some territory of modernity. Ironically, rather than convincing us of the book's thrusting engagement with all things cutting edge, the effect is usually anachronistic. In terms of subtlety, it's the literary equivalent of onscreen product placement, only what you're \"buying\" is not a brand of beer or shampoo, or even a designer handbag, but the book's currency as something current. The latest novel to be hailed, near-unanimously, as thoroughly of its time, is Joseph O'Neill's Netherland - a surprise omission from yesterday's Booker shortlist. It rightly deserves the words \"a post-9/11 masterpiece\" emblazoned across its cover. It even stakes a credible claim to being the next (if there was ever one in the first place of course) \"Great American Novel\". Of all O'Neill's achievements though, the greatest is a small passage halfway through the book that owes it power to an unlikely, yet perfectly apt, source. Google Earth - the search engine's satellite map of the planet - is not something that immediately suggests poetic depths; it's more often associated with security fears and, or, more recently (and a little less alarmingly), \"splash mobbing.\" However, halfway through Netherland, O'Neill gives us perhaps the most credible, compelling and unforgettable appearance of Google there has been (thus far) in a novel. The protagonist, Hans, is living alone in Manhattan after his wife and son have fled to London in the wake of the World Trade Centre attacks. Whilst his actual trips are limited to two flights a month, his virtual visits to his son come almost daily: \"Flying on Google's satellite function, night after night I surreptitiously travelled to England\". From his \"balloonist's vantage point\" he is able to hover above his wife and son's home and see \"my son's dormer, and the blue inflated pool, and the red BMW\" whilst knowing all the while that \"there was no way to see more or deeper, I was stuck\". Visually, it's a captivating passage (as of course is Google Earth itself) but even more remarkable is the way it encapsulates the paradox of living in world so bound to the internet. The whole planet is virtually accessible but, as Hans knows, the frustration of virtual accessibility and geographical intimacy is that they don't bring with them a similar emotional intimacy. Google Earth proves the perfect vehicle to express the strange sense of both interconnection and alienation that both pervades the book and seems to epitomize our era. Technology for technology's sake may be an irritation, but when, as O'Neill does, its presence in fiction tells us something about what it is to be human, it's astonishingly powerful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
