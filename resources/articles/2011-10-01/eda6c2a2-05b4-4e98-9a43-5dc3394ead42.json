In the UK, the average indie band is lucky if bootleggers have ironed their spotty faces on to a job-lot of cheap white T-shirts. For the Horrors' show in Mexico City, however, a whole row of market stalls has sprung up. As they wait eagerly outside the Jos\u00e9 Cuervo Sal\u00f3n, the hordes of teenage fans who have gathered in the midst of an apocalyptic thunderstorm can take their pick from an impressive array of mugs, tea towels, baby bibs and various other unlikely souvenirs. There are even a few furry dolls, dressed in T-shirts bearing the endearingly ungrammatical legend \"I Am A Horrors\". Later, these same dolls will be used by the crazed teenage masses to batter the band's tour bus as it pulls away from the venue. It's like a scene from A Hard Day's Night, as directed by Guillermo del Toro. Adulation is something that this band are beginning to become accustomed to. The Horrors are now established as Britain's premier cult band, pursuing their ambitions without offering any concessions to the mainstream. From the clatter of their 2007 debut, Strange House, to their glorious third album, Skying, they have moved their sound from the claustrophobic to something much more elemental and expansive. Majestic recent single Still Life sounded positively glacial next to the insistent thump of everything else on the Radio 1 playlist \u2013 not surprising when the band talk enthusiastically of finding inspiration in the otherworldly landscape of California's San Joaquin Valley, or the purple summit of Mount Fuji, as viewed from an aeroplane window. It's clear the Horrors' appeal travels as much as the band themselves do, though bassist Rhys Webb isn't sure exactly what makes Mexico go gaga for them. Pressed, he points out that both the Ramones and the Smiths are popular here, acknowledging that the Horrors provide a similar kind of solace for skinny, literate outsiders: \"With us, it's not just about songs, it's about being a part of something.\" \"For some reason they're into bands whose lives and music can't be separated,\" says Faris Badwan. The Horrors' diffident singer spends much of this trip curled in a corner, doodling compulsively in his notebook, but he is vocal when discussing the ardour of his Mexican fans. On stage, he abandons his usual static poses in a concerted attempt to engage with the crowd. \"It's a shot in the arm after doing a tour of anywhere else,\" he says solemnly. \"Half the time you feel that the people you're playing to are there to catch you out. If you get on a stage, you've got a lot of people trying to decide whether you deserve to be on it, whereas here there are no pretences. It's an audience without any cynicism.\" The barman delivers a fresh round of tamarind margaritas, an addictive local concoction that has fast become the band's tipple of choice. \"Tequila-based Mexican cocktails are probably our favourite drinks, wherever we are,\" decides Rhys. Has their appreciation for the local stimulants ever extended to peyote? \"Everyone I know who's taken peyote has a similar story,\" says guitarist Josh Hayward. \"They say how it's amazing, how they all sat round in a circle and went way into their past and met all their dead relatives \u2013 and then shat themselves.\" He grins. \"I'm not interested in that, thanks very much.\" A story about a friend's magic mushroom chocolate then follows, as synth player Tom Cowan gleefully relates the tale that took place on a day off in Venice Beach, California: \"Joe [Spurgeon, the drummer] was running around outside the Church Of Scientology, falling on to his knees and shouting. I had to remind him that, as visitors, we didn't want to be attracting unwanted attention to ourselves, so we agreed to try to act normal. And just as I said that, along the promenade came a guy dressed in an astronaut costume, on roller blades, playing a guitar through a mini-amp strapped to his belt. I couldn't stop laughing for 10 minutes.\" When informed this article is slated for The Guide's Halloween issue, the band emit a collective groan. Having long grown out of their old Victorian gaolers' outfits, they remain anxious not to be pegged as cartoon goths. As Rhys insists, \"That wasn't really the idea behind the band name, we just thought we were a bunch of horrors \u2013 as in, badly-behaved young men.\" So what if we decide instead that this is the Guide's D\u00eda De Los Muertos issue? The Mexicans have been serious about celebrating the dead for longer than anybody. One traditional belief is that the souls of the dead can be summoned to celebrate alongside the living. This is something that finds some favour among the Horrors. \"We've talked about possible dimension crossovers before,\" says Tom, raising an eyebrow. \"I don't like to write anything off.\" \"I'm all for it,\" decides Rhys, who proceeds to tell a rather unconvincing story about the ghost of a dead monk appearing at the end of his bed when he was on holiday in France as a child. \"You don't have to believe it,\" he adds, \"but I definitely think there's something going on.\" Physics grad Josh is rather more sceptical about the existence of supernatural realms, choosing instead to talk about how ancient Mexican priests used to build caves that boasted extraordinary acoustic properties in order to fool the masses into believing they possessed superhuman powers. \"Their grasp on acoustics was really startling. These caves were so reverberant that if you clapped your hands it would sound like a flock of birds. The priests would get people down there, probably after feeding them a lot of peyote, and the noise would scare the shit out of people because they'd think the devils had been roused.\" He's on a roll now. \"I remember we went to this church in Russia that had such a long reverb. All the speeches were very slow and monotonous and they built up in such a way that it created this constant low rumble. It felt like being brainwashed.\" Tom's eyes light up at the thought of using the Horrors' own music for such nefarious ends. \"Well, there's the hypersonic effect, which is if you put a certain tone into music that's way above the normal human hearing range, people will find that song more pleasurable because it stimulates alpha wave activity in the brain. At the other end of the scale, subsonic frequencies can make you feel really uneasy. Metal Machine Music, the Lou Reed album, has a few subsonic frequencies on it. We used to play it before we went on, and the soundman got people coming up to him begging him to turn it off.\" Unsurprisingly, most of the band were at the Roundhouse taking notes in 2008 when My Bloody Valentine unleashed their infamous sonic siege. \"It broke my watch!\" marvels Tom. Josh is equally enthused: \"It's the only experience I've had where sound has choked me. The pressure was so much in my ears that I couldn't breathe. But when you're under that much stress, you start hearing melodies that aren't there, which is really wonderful.\" As soon as this latest tour is over, Josh intends to return to his workshop to start devising ways to make his guitars sound even more physical and transcendent. Ghosts and ghouls and Mexican cave devils may not exist, but the threat of the Horrors one day producing a sound that makes everyone in their audience involuntarily soil themselves appears to be very real.
