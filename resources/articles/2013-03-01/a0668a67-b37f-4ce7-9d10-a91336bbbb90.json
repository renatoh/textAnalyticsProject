We are sad. Or is that exhaustion? Let's go with \"exhaustion.\" Thank you all for reading and commenting on the liveblogs. Thank you to fellow members of the Guardian CPAC Team: Adam Gabbatt, Matt Wells, Paul Harris, Ana Marie Cox, Katie Rogers, and Heather Long. Thank you to the very friendly, helpful and accomodating CPAC staff. Thank you, most of all, to Ronald Reagan, Jesus, and One Direction. Until next year, we cheer our Big Gulps to you, CPAC! Yeah, let's sic 'em on each other. Everyone loves a good fight! We're not finding much in Ted Cruz's speech. He emphasizes that it's important to \"Defend the Constitution,\" haven't heard THAT once all week... TIME FOR THE LAST SPEAKER, THANK GOD. It's Ted Cruz, who may be the most challenging one to sit through. It's time to announce the CPAC 2013 Straw Poll Results! The winner of this poll automatically wins the presidency in three years. Or sorry, we meant automatically \"loses\" the presidency. Previous straw poll winners include Gary Bauer, Phil Gramm, Steve Forbes, Rudy Giuliani, George Allen, and Ron Paul. And this year's winner is... As expected. Paulites travel well! Too bad he'll never be president now. The Washington Times: Paul 25%, Rubio 23%, Santorum 8%, Christie 7% Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the worst speaker joke of the conference, from a television personality named Graham Ledger: \"Like Fruit of the Loom, I'll be brief.\" Coulter notes that \"Mitt Romney won 20% of black males under 30\" and this somehow gets big applause as a great accomplishment. Now she is taking questions from the crowd, and a bunch of horny boys are asking her out. Why are we even bothering? And we've got a Chris Christie fat joke: \"Even CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year by about 300 pounds.\" Here comes Ann Coulter to troll us! (Successfully, we bet.) Time for *the* most important navel-gazing award of the week: the ACU Blogger of the Year Award!!!! It is Katie Pavlich, the news editor at Townhall.com. She thanks the late Andrew Breitbart first in her acceptance speech. Here's more on her from the ACU press release: Katie Pavlich is news editor of Townhall.com, author of the New York Times Best Seller Fast and Furious: Barack Obama's Bloodiest Scandal and the Shameless Cover-Up, and a Fox News contributor. As a reporter, she has covered news stories ranging from Fast &amp; Furious to the 2012 presidential election. She is a graduate of the University of Arizona with a degree in Broadcast Journalism and is a National Review Washington Fellow. Pavlich is also an avid lover of the outdoors and highly respects the right to bear arms. Perhaps the most important speech delivered at CPAC this year is one that very few of the people actually at CPAC know, or care, about. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher gave a (rescheduled) speech this morning on why we should break up the \"too big to fail\" megabanks, from a conservative perspective. A reporter covering the event, though, claims that only about 17-18 people showed up to listen. Among folks working in and covering the financial services industry, though, Fisher's speech will be closely watched. From Reuters: The largest U.S. banks are \"practitioners of crony capitalism,\" need to be broken up to ensure they are no longer considered too big to fail, and continue to threaten financial stability, a top Federal Reserve official said on Saturday. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, has been a critic of Wall Street's disproportionate influence since the financial crisis. But he was now taking his message to an unusual audience for a central banker: a high-profile Republican political action committee. Fisher said the existence of banks that are seen as likely to receive government bailouts if they fail gives them an unfair advantage, hurting economic competitiveness. [...] Fisher's vision pits him directly against Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who recently argued during congressional testimony that regulators had made significant progress in addressing the problem of too big to fail. Bernanke asserted that market expectations that large financial institutions would be rescued is wrong. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus just spoke and was sure to highlight Senator Rand Paul's work \"sticking it\" to the Obama administration during his 13-hour filibuster last week. A thick wave of applause followed. And yet this is why the Rand Paul for President mini-wave won't last too long. The vast majority of Republicans like the idea of killing suspected terrorists with weaponized drones. What they liked about Paul was that he managed to \"stick it\" to the Obama administration for a day. It has nothing to do with policy or fears over the anti-terrorist surveillance state. Adam Gabbatt brings us this lively dispatch from an \"NRA university\" class offered this afternoon: The \"NRA university\" held a class at CPAC just now, providing keen students with a series of figures and phrases and commanding them to go forth and spread the word. The session sought to play down the links between guns and crime by dispelling what the NRA said were \"gun control myths.\" An NRA member told the crowd that one of the myths was that requiring all guns and ammunition to be registered would lead to less gun violence. \"Registration will not do anything but prohibit law abiding citizens\" from their right to bear arms, we learned. The lecturer also revealed that \"guns are involved in 0.5% of accidental deaths in the US\" and that \"you're more likely to from a hammer than you are from an assault weapon\". Assault weapons were discussed too. \"I'm sure when you guys think of an assault weapon, this is what you think of,\" the NRA man said. He then played a 20 second clip of Arnold Schwarzenegger firing a machine gun in the film \"Predator\". This was contrasted with a clip of several people firing single rounds from AR-15 semi automatic-style weapons, prompting laughter. A woman from the NRA (the Guardian did not manage to get names) then took to the lectern to announce that \"we're currently in the fight of our lives for out second amendment rights, right now.\" \"Why is the NRA successful?\" she asked. The answer was \"because gun owners in this country are so passionate\". The NRA has around four million members. The population of the US is roughly 313m. \"The NRA did everything possible\" to try and defeat Obama, the lecturer said, but try as they might they could not win over young people. \"The other side is winning in the game to get young voters.\" It is the job of NRA university graduates to change that. Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Colorado anda rising African-American star in the conservative movement, was confident today in her confident speech about confidence, the Huffington Post's Jason Linkins explains: \"November 6 was a tough night for conservatives,\" Love said, urging the attendees to neither give in to demands to rebrand their movement or go into hiding. \"If we have confidence in our principles,\" she said, \"that will allow us to get up and climb again.\" Love continued in this vein, offering little more than a distillation of the themes that most of the speeches thus far have already hit. \"Persevere,\" she said. \"Be confident. My message for you ... is that there is great cause for confidence.\" \"Confidence means you stand up,\" she helpfully suggested. Basically, if you came into CPAC Saturday determined to drink every time you heard variations on the word \"confident,\" then you are in deep trouble right now. \"I have confidence,\" she said, wielding a hammer and seeing only nails. Sorry, we can't get over this \"Uninvited Panel.\" Here's the latest: Orly Taitz, the \"Queen Birther,\" was in attendance to ask the panel of anti-Islam lunatics barred from speaking at CPAC why they aren't also covering Barack Obama's birth certificate fraud. We think that's #CPACscore peaking at infinity/10. Here's the clip (via Salon): Breitbart.com is hosting an \"Uninvited Panel\" for the folks who were actually considered *too insane* to address CPAC, like anti-Islam firebrand bloggers like Pam Geller and Robert Spencer. It looks... scary: Onstage, a bunch of businesspeople and congressmen are speaking in extended metaphors about Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged - \"John Galt is alive and well and living Texas!\" said a Texas lady - which means it's time for us to not care about them and do a roundup of the latest CPAC commentary and reportage. The CPAC Party Report. [Slate] Defending the \"GOP of Old\" against Rand Paul. [Weekly Standard] A wide-ranging poll of 50 CPACers. [New York] Haters gonna hate: \"This was a bad day for the Republican Party. The Conservative Political Action Conference is an annual reminder of how easily the GOP could slip into obscurity if right-wing activists are given full control of the party\u2019s image.\" [National Journal] Being gay at CPAC. [National Review] Sarah Palin was fun! And easily captured the loudest and most frequent ovations from the crowd this weekend. Which makes perfect sense, since she is a professional entertainer now. She hit all the right checkboxes to get this crowd all jazzed up: Obama teleprompter jokes, White House tour cancellation jokes, jokes about her sex life, drinking a Super Big Gulp of Soda, gun talk, religion talk, a heartland twang voice, anti-DC trash talk, a Karl Rove swat, everything else. It worked. It was fun! She also let out a little hint about returning to politics... ...Which was of course a tease. She is not returning to politics anytime soon. She is an entertainer and part of her routine is to tease about how she may return to politics, for attention. She is not running for anything. If you see any story headlines this week like, \"Is Palin Running in 2016?\" then you should print out the full articles and burn them in a trash can, or bomb them. She likes playing pop star muse to the conservative movement, and that's all. Palin spends a while trashing the entrenched GOP \"consultant class\" one of the most common themes in speeches this week. May this screenshot be the Lasting Image of CPAC 2013: Palin sets up a quite extraordinary breasts-and-ammo joke by telling the crowd that for Christmas, her husband had bought her a rack to hold guns on the back of her truck. Then comes the sexy punchline: He's got the rifle, I've got the rack! It attracts whoops from the crowd. Palin then pulls out a Big Gulp from the lectern and silently drinks it for a while as the crowd goes wild, before saying, \"Dude it's just pop.\" This all actually happened. You'll love this one, Brits: Palin, whose family is involved in most reality programs on television, says \"We don\u2019t have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television.\" Actually, most of her big disses are perfectly applicable to her. That line? \"More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should've started with yours\"? Remember that her vetting involved a few minutes of googling from the McCain campaign staff. But whatever, she's funny and it doesn't matter. More like a deafening roar. It is truly 2009 again. Here's Palin, finally. She looks... sparkly. Palin is being introduced as someone who \"scares her opponents.\" Hmm. But when her name is announced it's... Senator Ted Cruz who comes out on stage. What is going on? He wants to introduce Palin too, he says, saying how she drives the liberal media \"batcrap insane.\" God, this guy is annoying. Where is Our Sarah? Cruz is talking very slowly. She's probably stuck on the highway. Everyone's got advice these days: Artur Davis, the former Democratic congressman who lost Alabama's Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2010 and then opportunistically switched to the GOP, is whining about how no one understands movement conservatives like him. Sarah Palin, the true hero of the GOP, speaks next. And now let's check in on latest wave of #CPACscore ratings from your Guardian CPAC team: Not only does GOP Senator Rob Portman now support gay marriage because of his gay son, he skips CPAC to go and do fun things with that gay son. The nerve of this man! Ana Marie Cox is not impressed with CPAC's attempts (or lack thereof) to bring women's issues into the fold: The GOP has a parallel problem, one that pre-dates Fox: Its leaders seem to think that paying attention to women is the same thing as taking them seriously. This kind of thinking was the great folly of the Republican National Convention in Tampa last year: a showcase of diversity at the top undergirded by policies that suppress it among the rank-and-file, not to mention outreach that seemed to underscore the essential air of condescension. Remember the \"Young Guns' Woman Up! Pavillion,\" were delegates could get \"hair and make-up touch-ups\" and salads? Remember \"Tuesday is Ladies' Night\"? Remember \"I love you, WOMEN\"? Remember Romney losing the female vote (or, as the New York Post put it, \"gals'\") by 10 points? Well, the organizers at CPAC learned sure their lesson from that debacle. They didn't feature women or women's issues at all. Yes, women were there. Plenty of them spoke! And not all of them introducing men. But the schedule was barren of any panel focused on outreach to women, any nod to the particular problem of attracting women to the conservative cause. If the Republican party's gender gap got addressed at all, organizers folded into \"minority\" outreach, which is really the kind of blindly patronizing identity politics that conservatives usually criticize liberals for. The one panel actually sponsored by a women's organization \u2013 the Independent Women's Forum \u2013 was about \"alarmist\" environmentalism. Carson, after wowing the crowd, is definitely looking into running for something. He is retiring from neurosurgery in 106 days, because there are \"so many more things can be done.\" The audience is adoring him: Dr. Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and whose story of growing up as a poor African-American child in the inner city is well known to those of us who attended grade school in Maryland, comes onstage to a roaring ovation. Carson has become a minor deity in conservative circles since his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in early February, where he took on President Obama during what is usually a non-partisan event. The Atlantic summarized his speech at the time: Carson delivered an opening shot against \"political correctness,\" and then -- after namechecking Tocqueville, recapping his own inspirational life story, and calling for a better education system -- voiced concern about the national debt and argued the case for a flat tax, using the Bible's injunction to tithe a set percentage, and for health-savings accounts, a medical option that has gained currency among conservatives. Crucially, he delivered this speech from a podium just feet from President Obama, who of course oversaw the passage of a very different health-care plan and has been a major proponent of progressive taxation. Obama, as he often does, remained somewhere between impassive and bored-looking. It's fair to say he didn't seem to be enjoying himself. Jeb Bush spoke at the annual CPAC dinner last night to take on his party, saying, \"way too many people believe Republicans are anti-immigrant, anti-woman, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-worker, and the list goes on and on and on. Many voters are simply unwilling to choose our candidates even though they share our core beliefs, because those voters feel unloved, unwanted and unwelcome in our party.\" The Guardian's Heather Long was in attendance, and the audience reaction was, well, flat: One name you don't hear a lot at CPAC 2013 is Bush. This is clearly Ronald Reagan's party, which is why it was odd that Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, was the keynote speaker at a Friday night dinner. He might have been better off not showing up at all. Many in the audience preferred their own conversations to listening to Jeb. He received some polite clapping, but certainly not on the level of rising stars like Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Paul Ryan. Jeb delivered a message that was reminiscent of his more famous brother's \"compassionate conservatism\" of 2000. He talked as much about income inequality and becoming a more diverse party as he did about core conservative principles. It didn't go down particularly well in this far right crowd and might explain why Jeb pulled his name out of CPAC's infamous straw poll for president. He sounded more moderate at a conference that is eager to stay truly conservative. Bachmann assaults the president, in all his vanity, for his many palatial luxuries: But hey, she's even-handed here, she's willing to make big concessions: Bachmann refers to the Benghazi attack response as \"one of the most shameful incidents in the history of the American presidency.\" Now Congresswoman Michele Bachmann comes onstage, immediately after Gingrich, welcoming the crowd - \"I love you too!\" - to Washington, \"the epicenter of care and compassion!\" It is far too early on a Saturday morning for this... Gingrich, once a prolific Amazon.com reviewer, is giving props to Citizenville, the book by... very liberal California lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom?? \"Every single conservative should read it,\" he says. Newtie is just freestyling. \"I brought two props,\" Gingrich says. Uh oh. \"An original source of light from about 5,000 years old\" - a candle - and a light bulb. Newt Gingrich is here, fundamentally, to change the landscape of CPAC, America and Civilization forever, fundamentally, with a grand(iose) speech. The emcee today - some kid - says the name of New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, which is enough to elicit loud boos. Paul Krugman \"writes the majority of economic textbooks in this country,\" he says. Be scared! Famous union-busting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker is delivering his first CPAC speech since surviving a recall election last summer. He is well received. As for his speech, there's much of your typical \"Blah blah Reagan Reagan stop the liberals\" pablum. He's probably exhausted from already making news (in that weird \"non-news\" sense we all know and love) this morning. He wants to be your President, America: Walker insisted he was visiting Iowa in May only because he was invited by Gov. Terry Branstad. But when pressed about his White House ambitions, the Wisconsin Republican said: \u201cWould I ever be [interested]? Possibly. I guess the only thing I\u2019d say is I\u2019m not ruling it out.\u201d Perhaps even more notably, Walker wouldn\u2019t commit to serving throughout a second four-year term. He said his focus is on substance, not longevity. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s really a measure of what I\u2019ve accomplished and what more I could accomplish if I was in a different position,\u201d Walker told POLITICO at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he\u2019ll speak Saturday. The \"Frederick Douglass Republican\" who hosted yesterday's tense session/melee on race relations, K Carl Smith, passed along a statement through a spokesperson: I was invited by the Tea Party Patriots to conduct a breakout session entitled: \"Trump The Race Card\" and share the Frederick Douglass Republican Message. In the middle of my delivery, while discussing the 1848 \"Women's Rights Convention,\" I was rudely interrupted by a woman working for the Voice of Russia. She abruptly asked me: \"How many black women were there?\" This question was intentionally disruptive and coercive with no way of creating a positive dialogue. In addition, a young man who wasn't a Tea Party Patriot, made some racially insensitive comments, he said: \"Blacks should be happy that the slave master gave them shelter, clothing, and food.\" At the conclusion of the breakout session, I further explained to him the Frederick Douglass Republican Message which he embraced, bought a book, and we left as friends. Welcome. To. CPAC. 2013. The Final Day. Are you prepared? The Guardian CPAC Team has been delighted to bring you the highlights ... and racism... from days one and two of the Conservative Political Action Conference live from the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center here in National Harbor, Maryland. And now that it's the final day, we're finally going to say it: Ha ha, \"Gaylord.\" The conservatives are holding their conference at the \"Gaylord.\" Stop giggling now, we're on company time.
