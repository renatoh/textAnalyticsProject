Seemed a pretty long title to me - how does it fare compared with others? John Horwich, Battersea At 13 words, it ties for seventh place with Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964). The longest title is Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Hellbound, Flesh-Eating Subhumanoid Zombified Living Dead, Part 3 (37 words, 192 letters). This comic redubbing of Joseph Green's 1962 sci-fi chiller, The Brain That Wouldn't Die, was directed by James Riffel, who, in 1991, had used the pseudonym Lowell Mason to rework George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead as Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D (41 words, 168 letters). The record for an original work, however, belongs to Lina Wertm\u00fcller's 1978 drama, Un Fatto di sangue nel commune di Sculiana fra due unomini per causa di una vedova si sospetanomoventi politici. Amore-Morte-Shimmy. Lugano belle. Tarantelle. Taratelle e vino (26 words, 171 letters). This was abbreviated in Italy to Fatto di sangue fra due uomini per causa di una vedova - si sospettano moventi politici, while the English-language title was Blood Feud. A recut version was simply dubbed, Revenge. If Sacha Baron Cohen and Robert Downey Jr are racing to become the big screen's next Sherlock Holmes, who was the first? Meg Little, Luton The identity of the eponymous actor in Sherlock Holmes Baffled remains unknown. Running some 30 seconds, the film was produced for the Mutoscope peepshow in 1900 (although the copyright on one existing version states 1903) and features a cigar-smoking Holmes disturbing a burglar, who keeps disappearing thanks to some stop-frame magic.

Marsha Rodgers, Ipswich The edifice and searchlights logo was designed in 1933 by matte artist Emil Kosa Jr to preface releases by 20th Century Pictures, with the accompanying fanfare being composed by Alfred Newman. The original third layer words \"Pictures Inc\" were replaced by \"Fox\" when the studio merged with the Fox Film Corporation in 1935 and this combination remained in situ for 18 years, with a Technicolor version being available from Henry King's Ramona (1936). With the introduction of CinemaScope in 1953, the front office decided that the logo needed to be more imposing and new graphics were commissioned for Howard Hawks' How to Marry a Millionaire, to which Newman appended the \"CinemaScope extension\", which became the standard following another Marilyn Monroe vehicle, Henry Hathaway's River of No Return (1954). This revision, which was conducted by Alfred's brother Lionel, predominantly held sway over the next four decades, although Fox inexplicably dropped its trademark in 1970, only to reinstate it a year later after a public outcry. New recordings of the fanfare were made by John Williams for Irvin Kershner's The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and respectively in 1994 and 1997 by Bruce Broughton and David Newman (who is Alfred's son) to accompany the existing CGI aerial swoop version of the so-called \"majestic tower\". Several novelty credits have been produced down the years, with cars driving through the \"O\" in The Cannonball Run (1981), the searchlights going out in Die Hard 4.0 and Ralph Wiggum singing along with the fanfare in The Simpsons Movie (both 2007).
