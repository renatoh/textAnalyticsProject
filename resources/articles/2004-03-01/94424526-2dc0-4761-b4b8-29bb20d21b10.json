While Tendulkar scored a sensational 141, including 17 fours and a six, India fell just short of Pakistan's329 for six from their 50 overs, set up by a 138-run partnership between openers Shahid Afridi (80) and Yasir Hameed (86). India remained in the hunt right through, with man-of-the-match Tendulkar keeping the run-rate ticking over nicely. However, the match started to slip away after his fall in the 39th over with the total on 245. Rahul Dravid (36), Yuvraj Singh (19) and Mohammad Kaif (7) fell in quick succession before debutant Ramesh Powar (18 not out) and Lakshmipathy Balaji (14) raised visions of an unlikely victory by smashing Shoaib Akhtar for 16 runs in the 48th over. The Indian innings finally ended on 317, Mohammad Sami bowling Ashish Nehra to finish with three wickets for 41. India had won the first match of the five-match series in a thrilling finale by just five runs at Karachi last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
