It became a consistent, nagging drag on my week. Then the Q&amp;A season finished and suddenly Monday nights were no big deal, I was sleeping like a baby. I quit Q&amp;A. I never missed the shouting over the top of each other, the clever but cutting tweets, Tony Jones consistently forgetting his female guests might have something interesting to say, or the regular reminder of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s charm. It was all very stressful to watch and seemed a very blokey way to communicate. When I heard that there would be an all-female panel for International Women\u2019s Day, three thoughts came to mind: (1) isn\u2019t that two weeks too late (a panel on domestic violence might have been a good start for an all-female or at least female-dominated panel)?; (2) I might watch that to see if it is possible to have a less confrontational tone on a panel show about politics; and (3) what a tokenistic load of bollocks! But then I discovered Annabel Crabb was hosting and agreed to watch. Who could resist her? Far from keeping me up, however, this episode put me to sleep. What a bore it turned out to be. It wasn\u2019t from a lack of talent on the panel. Germaine Greer; Julie Bishop; engineer and founder of Youth Without Borders, Yassmin Abdel-Magied; author, academic and Guardian US columnist Roxane Gay; and Best &amp; Less CEO Holly Kramer. Women with diverse and rich backgrounds, knowledge on multiple policy areas, experts in business, politics, social policy, racial politics, engineering and arts. And what did they talk about? \u201cWomen\u2019s issues.\u201d It\u2019s 2015 and we still think that when we get a bunch of women of the TV their only acceptable area of expertise is a few pre-approved liberal feminist issues that will do nothing to disrupt the status quo. Are we supposed to feel grateful for this? Yes, we\u2019re going backwards in the pay gap, housework, childcare, how much hair women remove from their bodies, how we value women\u2019s work and women\u2019s voices. But this is old ground. It\u2019s not enough to point out, as Abdel-Magied did, that structural inequality is to blame for the lack of women\u2019s progress. How can you expect to address structural inequality if the only subject women are allowed to talk on with any authority are women on boards, women\u2019s pay, and how you manage kids and work! A man was allowed to ask a question outside the script \u2013 he asked about Bishop\u2019s work to get a reprieve for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. He asked, in other words, about her job. The only man, the only interesting question. I don\u2019t think it was a coincidence. As if to ram home my own sad conclusions, a woman asked Julie Bishop if she could do her job as foreign minister if she had kids. She doesn\u2019t even have kids and she\u2019s still being asked about them! It\u2019s not that these issues aren\u2019t worth discussing. I\u2019m always telling my friends they\u2019re crazy for having their pubic hair lasered off. But that\u2019s not the only subject we talk about. We also talk about work, movies, the economy, Taylor Swift, Tony Abbott and how no man has ever had better hair than Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey\u2019s character on Grey\u2019s Anatomy). What would happen, I wonder, if a panel of women were allowed on TV to discuss topics of interest to them \u2013 I mean, all of them. What if they spent the evening talking social and economic policy and how to change society in order for it to work better for men and women? Not \u2013 as this episode became \u2013 how to change society so that rich white women can get better at assimilating into a culture designed for men. Thank God for Greer. She provided the only laughs of the evening. And of course they were controversial, of course they were offensive. That is what Greer has always been and will always be. The Twitterati was outraged at her suggestion that her career would have been boring without male attention. Or worse yet, that her strategy for putting an end to her superior\u2019s unwanted advances was to invite him round to her place for drinks and arrange for a student to show up at the same time. Her second joke was asking Bishop if she\u2019d \u201cliberate her nipples\u201d (the latest online fad among girls, apparently, for taking photos of their nude breast and posting them online) if it meant Chan and Sukumaran would be spared state-sanction murder by firing squad. Bishop, rightly, ignored the question. But we needed the laugh because the sad, depressing conclusion of the event \u2013 despite Crabb\u2019s wonderfully inclusive style, despite promising young women asking questions, despite all the consensus \u2013 was that if this was the best the national broadcaster could come up with for International Women\u2019s Day in 2015, the situation is worse than I thought. When, at the end of the show, Roxane Gay said she loved being a woman because \u2013 and casually lifted her bosom with a wry smirk \u2013 she seemed to be saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got jokes but I\u2019m too bored to make them.\u201d How insulting to ask this fascinating woman onto Australia\u2019s pre-eminent politics shows and then limit so severely what she was allowed to talk about. So although I almost fell asleep while watching, I was once again kept up by Q&amp;A \u2013 by my utter frustration at all the unasked questions. I was right to quit Q&amp;A. I\u2019m not grateful for it, I\u2019m ashamed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
