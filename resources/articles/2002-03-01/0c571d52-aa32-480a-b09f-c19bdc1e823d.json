Does anyone know the exact details of this, or if it's just an urban myth? It might sound like an urban myth, Alasdair, but it's (almost) 100% true. The crazy events you describe took place in a Shell Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada in 1994. Going into the last group game Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals to qualify for the final stages. Anything less and Grenada went through. So far, so simple. Except that the organisers had decided that, in the case of extra time, a golden goal would count as two goals. You don't have to be Einstein to work out what happened next. Barbados raced to a 2-0 lead before Grenada made it 2-1 with seven minutes remaining. The Barjans were heading out unless they scored a goal; any goal. Fortunately for them, with three minutes left, they did just that - only not in the right net. Their deliberate own goal made it 2-2 and propelled the game towards extra time. Now, farcically, Grenada needed to score a goal (at either end) to go through. Cue frantic defending of both penalty areas by Barbados until the final whistle. Such dubious shenanigans were rewarded, however, when Barbados scored the golden goal - this time in Grenada's net - four minutes into extra time to win the match 3-2 (or 4-2 according to the rules of the tournament) and qualify for the finals. Incidentally, the match is detailed in more depth here However this isn't the only example of a blatant own-goal being scored to further a team's ambitions. As James Syme points out, it also happened in the infamous 1998 Tiger Cup game between Thailand and Indonesia. \"Whoever won would get to face hot favourites Vietnam in the next round, so both teams tried to throw the match,\" he says. \"At 2-2 and with a few minutes left, the Indonesians dropped all pretence and turned on their own goal, now defended by Thai players. \"In injury time the Indonesian keeper-captain Mursyid Effendi 'saved' the ball, turned round and thumped the ball into his own goal for a 3-2 final result.\" Justice was eventually served, however. For not only did Indonesia and Thailand lose their semi-final games (to Singapore and Vietnam, respectively) but both were also fined $40,000 for \"violating the spirit of the game.\" Meanwhile Mursyid Effendi was banned for life.

Sheffield United striker Brian Deane scored the first goal in what is basically still the old First Division (except the old First Division wasn't a cartel). He slotted home after barely five minutes of the Blades' home game against Manchester United, a game the United of Sheffield won 2-1. Deane beat two other players to this great honour by a whopping four minutes. Dainty Chelsea striker Mick Harford scored the opener in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Oldham, while Paul Williams was opening the scoring for Coventry in their 2-1 victory over Wimbledon. Of all the clubs we mention, only Manchester United and Chelsea remain in the top flight. What happened to all the smaller clubs since the inauguration of the Premiership, we wonder? KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE PLUG \"Martin Tyler told us the other day that Patrick Vieira will win his 50th cap against Scotland. But do other countries award caps for international appearances, or is it only the home associations?\" asks Mike Gautrey. Patrick Vieira did make his 50th international appearance, a milestone that puts him alongside other international greats such as Gary Neville. We're not sure whether the French FA will award him a cap to celebrate - can you help? - but we did cover the history English international caps in July 2000.

My brother and I have spent many hours arguing over Lee Dixon,\" says Paul Antcliffe. \"I swear blind that the man has scored over 60 career goals, but my brother maintains that the ageing right-back couldn't finish a hot dinner. Which brother is right?\" Sadly, all those hours arguing over Lee Dixon - surely you had better things to do, like the ironing? - were a waste of time. Because you're both wide of the mark. During his 20-year career, Dixon has played 813 matches for Burnley, Chester, Bury, Stoke and Arsenal, scoring 39 goals - a figure which sadly doesn't include a 40-year pearler of an own goal against Coventry a few years back. By our calculations that's a goal just over every 20 matches. Okay, so he's not Ronaldo. But for a defender, his record isn't too bad. By contrast, Nigel Winterburn - Dixon's long-time defensive partner at Arsenal - has scored only 21 goals in his 835 professional matches. HOW DID UNITED SIGN FORLAN WHEN HE WAS UNCAPPED? I heard that Diego Forlan is about to make his debut for his country, Uruguay,\" says Omar Yacub. \"My question is: if he was not a full international, let along appearing in 75% of his country's games, how did he manage to acquire a work permit? It's not the conspiracy you think, Omar. Forlan possesses a bona-fide Italian passport and therefore didn't need to appear in 75% of his country's games to get a work permit. PAUL STEWART - A CORRECTION In the February 14 edition of the Knowledge we said that Paul Stewart was the only man to have played in the Tottenham v Arsenal, Liverpool v Everton, Manchester City v United and Palace v Millwall derbies. However, as Jon Keen points out, we got it wrong. \"Paul Stewart did not actually play in a Manchester derby - his first game for Manchester City was during the 1986/87 season, but two weeks after their last game that season against Manchester United,\" he says. \"His only other season at Manchester City was 1987/88 when they were in the Second Division (and there weren't any Manchester Cup derbies in that season),\" he adds. \"Incidentally, I got this from this excellent unofficial Reading website\", he adds. Can you help? \"Just to settle an argument, can someone tell me which has the largest global audience; the FA Cup Final, or the Super Bowl?\" asks Rudy Hulsman. \"Peter Shreeves, now boss of Barnet, has claimed that England's squad for Japan and Korea is too young, adding that no country ever won a World Cup without an average squad age of 28 or 29,\" says Grace Pickering. \"I'm now intrigued -- could this be true? What is the most successful average age for a squad entering the world's greatest competition?\" \"Which player has scored a goal in the most different countries during a single year?\" asks Paul Carek. \"What was the name of the goalkeeper in the 1970s who had a plastic knuckle?\" asks Tom Alice. \"Who has played the fewest club games before getting the nod to play for the national side?\" asks Paul Antcliffe. \"Has there ever been an outfield player who played over 200 club games but never scored a goal?\" asks Neil Denny. \"Martin Tiler told us the other day that Patrick Vieira was about to win his 50th cap in the game against Scotland,\" says Mike Gautrey. \"But do other countries award caps for international appearances, or is it only the home associations?\" Email the.boss@theguardian.com if you know the answers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
