The mobile phone industry is to recycle or reuse them for nothing, or in some cases give a discount off the cost of a new handset. Preventing them being thrown away will save 1,500 tonnes of waste going to landfill every year. Shields Environmental, which is running the programme, dubbed Fonebak, has got Britain's five main mobile phone operators - O2, Orange, T-Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone - in the scheme along with Dixons Group, which includes Dixons, Currys, The Link and PC World. With 45m mobile phones in use in Britain, handsets are now a fashion accessory. The average user replaces the handset every 18 months, while its working life expectancy is eight years. This provides a second hand market in phones which are refurbished and sold to eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Most, however, will now be recycled, extracting gold, platinum, silver and copper. The metals are extracted during this process and put back into use. Contents of batteries pose a threat to the environment. One cadmium battery could pollute 600,000 litres of water. When disposed of via Fonebak, these metals are also reused, in the case of nickel into irons and saucepans. Mixed plastics (those that contain metals and plastics) are sent to a specialist recycler in Sweden who incinerates the plastic and uses the energy to heat the local village. Other plastics are sent for granulation and end up as traffic cones or are used on horse gallops. The scheme is the first to comply with current legislation and the forthcoming WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) directive, which sets guidelines and targets for the recycling of potentially harmful electrical waste. The government, which has previously failed to anticipate new waste directives, was delighted by the mobile phone recycling scheme. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said he was pleased the terms of the directive were being met before the disposal of phones became a problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
