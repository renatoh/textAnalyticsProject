The designer tried to commit suicide on Monday, Tomasz Tadla, a spokesman for prosecutors in the southern Polish city of Katowice, where the exhibition hall collapsed on Saturday, said. Mr Tadla said the unnamed designer had \"information that could help determine the cause\" of the disaster, but declined to elaborate on what this might be. He said the investigation had found that the hall had some defects before its snow-covered roof collapsed as around 500 people attended a pigeon racing show inside. It was still too early to determine how the defects could have contributed to the accident, in which around 160 people were injured, he added. In other developments today, authorities reduced the official death toll from 65 to 63, blaming the discrepancy on incorrect information from funeral homes and morgues. Several funerals for victims of the accident were held across Poland as three official days of mourning, called for by the president, Lech Kaczynski, came to an end. At the disaster scene, rescue workers using infrared cameras and dogs were today continuing to search for bodies buried beneath the debris. Officials said the number of foreigners among the victims had increased to nine after the body of a 39-year-old Hungarian man was identified. The body was one of three detected by search dogs and pulled from the wreckage of the building yesterday. The man, from Budapest, was found among the remains of the exhibition stand of the animal feed company he worked for, the Hungarian foreign ministry said. Two Germans, two people from the Czech Republic, two people from Slovakia, one Belgian and one Dutch citizen were also identified as victims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
