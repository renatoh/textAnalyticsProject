We need to confront the history of the United States \u2013 the history of genocide and slavery,\u201d said Nelini Stamp, one of the marchers and a member of the Working Families party. The march was organized after the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville that culminated in the death of the democracy activist Heather Heyer. Activists set off from Charlottesville on Monday and plan to arrive in Washington on Wednesday 6 September. Stamp said racism in the US runs deeper than the white supremacy demonstrations seen in Charlottesville. \u201cThe president keeps threatening to remove [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program] for undocumented immigrants and undocumented youths. And if he does that, that is white supremacy,\u201d Stamp said. \u201cThere is rumors out of Congress of increasing prison spending and prison budgets. That is a form of white supremacy because black and brown people are being incarcerated at enormous rates.\u201d Adios, Christopher Columbus Los Angeles became the largest city in the US to ditch Columbus Day on Wednesday, when the city council voted to rename the public holiday \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s Day\u201d. It was a victory for Native American activists and others, who have long protested the celebration of Christopher Columbus. They argue Columbus was responsible for the colonization of the US and the genocide that followed. The Los Angeles Times reported that the city voted 14-1 in favor of the renaming, which was pushed by Mitch O\u2019Farrell, a city councilman and member of the Wyandotte Nation tribe in Oklahoma. Five states in the US do not acknowledge the name Columbus Day \u2013 Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon, South Dakota, and Vermont \u2013 while cities including Phoenix and Seattle have previously voted to rebrand the public holiday (which falls on 9 October this year). Who\u2019s actually running for president in 2020? Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the standout progressives among a slew of Democrats positioning themselves for a presidential run in 2020, Axios reported on Friday. According to Axios, there are up to \u201cthree dozen\u201d Democrats weighing a run against Trump \u2013 the chances of them running ranging from \u201cpossible to plausible to probable\u201d. The candidates being watched most closely are the senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris, as well as New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, Axios said. What we\u2019re reading \u2022 Houstonia magazine has put together a list of local charities that people can donate to in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The charities include Baker Ripley, which helps low-income Houstonians, and the Montrose Center\u2019s LGBTQ disaster relief fund. \u2022 Eric Levitz, writing in New York Magazine, says that as the 2018 midterm elections approach, liberals have had considerable success in influencing the Democratic party. \u201cProgressives have created a world where darlings of the Democratic donor wing can call for the (virtual) abolition of the private insurance industry; in fact, this appears to be the politically savvy thing to do,\u201d Levitz says.
