The damage was compounded last week when 49 organisations missed out on Australia Council funding \u2013 and compounded again this week, when the federal government denied changes to jobkeeper legislation that would make the benefits more accessible to casual workers and those on short-term contracts (AKA most arts and entertainment workers). But there are small things you can do. For instance: streaming Australian music. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 brand new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. \u201cAustralian music needs all the help it can get right now,\u201d says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who\u2019ve played Sound Australia\u2019s events. \u201cStreaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
