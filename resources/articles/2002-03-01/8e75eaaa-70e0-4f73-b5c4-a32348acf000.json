Pipe, who also has Mr Cool in the race, is chasing the sponsor's bonus - which has been upped to \u00a360,000 - awarded to any horse who lands Saturday's contest and goes on to victory in any event at next week's Cheltenham Festival. Pipe, who has Polar Red entered in the Gerrard Supreme Novice Hurdle and Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle at Cheltenham, said: \"We always go for the double and Polar Red is due to run, but he went up 23lb for beating Eternal Spring five lengths at Cheltenham last time. \"It was great to get the bonus up with Blowing Wind and Olympian. I just hope we can do it again, but it won't be easy.\" Polar Red, who won as he liked at Cheltenham, was yesterday installed 5-2 favourite by internet bookmakers Blue Square, followed by Tikram, Majlis, Through The Rye and Rooster Booster all on the 8-1 mark. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
