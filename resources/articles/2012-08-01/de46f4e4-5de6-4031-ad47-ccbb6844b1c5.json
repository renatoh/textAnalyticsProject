Although exotic fruits are no stranger to northern climes (long before the industrial revolution, pineapples were grown against south-facing walls on estates in Scotland in the 18th century) news that the first commercially grown British apricots are appearing on the market should gladden the gloomiest of hearts. After the emergence of the kiwi in the Garden of England, the arrival of the apricot should come as little surprise. It is not just that winters are getting milder and summers hotter. The first commercial orchard in Kent is profiting from hardier breeding stocks developed in New Zealand and the US. Apricot trees prefer deep, well-prepared soil but they can also be grown in pots. They are relatively fast growing. A three-year-old tree can produce 20 fruit. That might seem quite a long time to wait for a couple of pots of jam, but the colour, texture and taste will be worth every mouthful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
