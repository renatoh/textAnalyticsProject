James Horler, the chief executive who is also credited with developing Frankie &amp; Benny's, the star-performing chain within the Restaurant Group, said La Tasca's value-for-money offering was not suffering in any wider consumer slowdown. \"The casual dining market continues to grow,\" he said. \"Our average spend is only \u00a313 a head.\" La Tasca's performance is being closely watched by a handful of rival restaurant groups considering flotations. They include Altia, which runs the three pizza restaurants Pizza Express, Ask and Zizzi's. Altia has appointed Merrill Lynch to consider strategic options, including a new issue. Similar reviews are being carried out by Edinburgh investment house Noble on behalf of Loch Fyne Restaurants, and by Close Brothers for Carluccio's. Last night La Tasca shares closed up 2.5p at 135.5p - 23% above the flotation price. The group reported underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a33.9m for the year to April 30, on turnover up 23% to \u00a348.8m. Trading since then \"has continued to be good\", it said. Mr Horler said the group intends to open between eight and 10 La Tasca restaurants a year in Britain, with a target of 100. He is also developing La Vi\u00f1a, an upmarket tapas chain of which two have opened so far and are said to be trading well. The company wants to open a further two to four La Vi\u00f1as a year and is confident they will not take trade from La Tasca restaurants. La Tasca is also expanding into the US. Its two sites in Washington DC and Arlington, Virginia, are already profitable, and a third is expected to open soon in Baltimore. Mr Horler said he was aware that many British restaurant operators, including PizzaExpress and the Belgian-themed restaurant Belgo, had been humbled by costly forays across the Atlantic. \"No company has really done it before. We know that. But we are not going to go and blow a whole lot of money in the US.\" About 70% of La Tasca's customers are women. Mr Horler said a 5% rise in the number of working women in the past five years had been accompanied by a 28% rise in restaurant meals eaten in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
