The oversized cutout of the former president\u2019s smiling face, taped to a long stick, bobbed above the crowd as fans cheered on the Scottish band Chvrches during their performance on Saturday. One of the four women from San Francisco who put together the prop described it as a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d during a weekend of fun amid deep divisions and conflicts marking much of America\u2019s public life. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to attend something like this and not be mindful of what\u2019s happening in our country, but I think that it [the festival] is a distraction without me feeling like I\u2019m losing sight of the work that still needs to be done,\u201d said Kaisha-Dyan McMillan, 43, a writer who lives in Oakland. \u201cI find myself getting extremely overwhelmed by the negativity and the awfulness that\u2019s happening on the news.\u201d McMillan came mainly to see Janelle Mon\u00e1e, NERD, the comedian Phoebe Robinson, and Janet Jackson, whose 1986 song Nasty made a comeback after Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton \u201csuch a nasty woman\u201d during a president debate. Jackson\u2019s headline set on Sunday began with a video collage of news images and headlines displaying many of today\u2019s ills: prejudice, inequality, shootings and more. The intro finished by asking if everyone got the social issue messages before letting them know it was time to dance. Then Burnitup! blared through the speakers and white lights swept across the stage. Jackson went on to perform many of her hits, including Nasty, What Have You Done for Me Lately, and Control. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice to get away from everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d said Patrice Wright, an Oakland resident in her 40s. \u201cWhen I heard Janet Jackson was going to be here this year, I bought a ticket right away. It\u2019s a great distraction.\u201d \u201cSan Francisco and the Bay Area in general is always seen as this really open-minded liberal place, but a lot of the incidents that have gone mainstream recently have been out of the Bay Area,\u201d Wright said, referring to BBQ Becky, Permit Patty, Jogger Joe and the murder of Nia Wilson. \u201cWhat\u2019s kind of disappointing is just the reaction to it, where everyone is just like, \u2018Well, it wouldn\u2019t happen here\u2019, or that it is just a one-time situation. It\u2019s not.\u201d N\u00e9o Modise, a 28-year-old Hayward resident came to the festival to enjoy a number of artists, including NERD. \u201cBeing here, you see a lot of \u2018Fuck Trump\u2019 shirts or things like that,\u201d he said. But the band\u2019s performance emphasized common ground, telling people in the crowd they were \u201cbrothers\u201d and \u201csisters\u201d, regardless of their racial background, Modise said Similar calls for unity came during Florence and the Machine\u2019s set. Lead singer Florence Welch said she was saddened by \u201cthese days\u201d and that \u201cwe all belong here\u201d. And in a long, calm, middle passage of the hit song Dog Days Are Over, she asked audience members to embrace, express love for one another and \u201ctell a stranger that you love them, because I promise you, on some cosmic level, you do\u201d. She went even further, asking people to put away their phones. Upraised glowing rectangles of light winked out in response. Lauren Mayberry, the lead singer of Chvrches who has discussed issues ranging from #MeToo to gun control, veered away from heavy commentary. She told the crowd that she had been criticized for speaking about Trump because he was the leader of a country that wasn\u2019t her own. She pointed out that she had the right to do so if he posed a broader threat to global stability, but left it at that. Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s lieutenant governor who is running for governor in 2018, added another political element to the lineup with a discussion on Saturday that touched upon healthcare, college education costs, real estate prices, reproductive rights, Trump, and the cannabis industry. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad what\u2019s going on on the federal level,\u201d said Angel Ortega, a 20-year-old student at the festival. \u201cBut with Gavin Newsom and other more liberal and progressive politicians making their way into politics, I personally have a more optimistic view of the future. I think we\u2019re going to do well after Trump.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
