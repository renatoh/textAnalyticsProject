Come Bonfire Night, it's always Lewes that's the media tart, hogging the limelight with its conflagrations and humorous Guys. But what about Bridgwater? Bridgwater? Exactly. Little did ye know that Bridgwater on Guy Fawkes Night claims to have the largest illuminated carnival in Europe (4 November this year). Who knew about the splendidly eccentric tradition of Somerset November carnivals? Scores of clubs in different towns and villages compete for the best themed \"cart\" (they're not called floats round here), each lit up like a Wurlitzer with multicoloured lightbulbs (lightbulbs being a post-Victorian safety initiative to stop the town burning down), and each watched by hundreds of thousands of locals. Bridgwater's is the oldest and biggest, transforming the place into carnivalesque Rio, only with hot cider and 100-watt bulbs (surely eco-bulbs these days). Check out the footage (and the marvellous Alan Partridge-ish presenter) at bridgwatercarnival.org.uk. The other 364 days? Well, Bridgwater may lack a Sugar Loaf Mountain and scantily clad beauties, but it's second to none for corn exchanges, slender-spired parish churches and a bookshop to blow your socks off. The case against You get a sense that its heyday was around 1702. Sleepy: the kind of place the M5 was designed to pass by. Would a nuclear power station bother you? Hinkley Point is just up the road. Well connected? Hourly trains to Bristol and Exeter (50 mins), and Taunton (15 mins), and the M5 with Bristol and Exeter 45 minutes away, make it prime commuter territory. Schools Lots of \"satisfactory\" schools, says Ofsted, such as St John and St Francis CofE, St Mary's CofE, Westover Green Community, and Somerset Bridge \"good\". Secondaries: Robert Blake Science College is \"outstanding\". Hang out at... My money's on Clavelshay Barn outside town. Lovely cows. Where to buy The town is blessed with architecture from its 18th-century trading heyday. Otherwise it's west to Wembdon, with Victorians up the hill for a quick escape to the Quantocks, Exmoor and the coast. Durleigh Road is pleasant.

From the streets Laura Costello \"Bridgwater is no gem, but it redeems itself with its location on the edge of the Quantocks.\" Alison Palmer \"Good Georgian architecture in Castle Street and King Square. The carnival \u2013 a huge amount of energy goes into one night a year. Dead town centre, caused by the many supermarkets, and rough as a badger's bum after dark.\" Alona De Havilland \"Scott cinema, a wonderful reminder of a trip to the movies from a bygone age.\" \u2022 Live in Bridgwater?
