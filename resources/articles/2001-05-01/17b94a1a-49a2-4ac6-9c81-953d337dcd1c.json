Last week, the Football League's board of directors claimed that Chesterfield's punishment was too lenient - and asked their disciplinary panel to reconsider their decision. But today the panel upheld their original verdict. If the nine point deduction is upheld - and it still needs to be ratified by the League's board of directors - Chesterfield will drop to third with 77 points, three points ahead of Hartlepool, who only have one game left to play. Chesterfield chief executive John Green felt it was \"the common-sense decision\" for the panel to agree the same punishment again. \"I knew this would happen,\" he added. \"It's a common-sense decision made by a panel of three men who have been honourable throughout the hearing put in a position by the authorities above them to find another decision that suited their views and not a decision based on the facts presented at the hearing. \"This is a fantastic day for everybody at Chesterfield and a great boost for the lads against Brighton tonight and let's just everybody get behind the team now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
