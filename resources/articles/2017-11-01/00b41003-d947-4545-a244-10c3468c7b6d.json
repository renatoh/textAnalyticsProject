As the party launches inquiries into claims of improper conduct against at least four parliamentarians, complainants said that they have been offered no guarantee that their names will be anonymised before being passed on. Alleged victims have also expressed concern that they have not been told the identities of the three panel members who will hear their cases. Party sources claim that the panel has not yet been set up, even though the inquiries have sent out their first letters inviting complainants to come forward. It comes as Theresa May also faces criticism that parliament will once again be allowed to \u201cmark its own homework\u201d on sexual harassment, as her new cross-party working group to deal with the problem will be made up of 10 senior MPs and just two staff representatives. It will be chaired by Andrea Leadsom, the Tory leader of the House of Commons, and is set to be dominated by frontbenchers, including Dawn Butler and Valerie Vaz for Labour and Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems. The group, which is expected to meet for the first time on Tuesday, will set up a new process for sexual harassment complaints by staff against MPs, but in the meantime it is up to the parties to deal with allegations of misconduct. Four Conservative MPs have now been referred to the party\u2019s new internal disciplinary panel, which was set up two weeks ago following a flurry of allegations against politicians. Daniel Kawczynski, the MP for Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham, was referred to the panel for investigation over allegations he had put pressure on a female colleague to go on a \u201cdate\u201d with a business contact. Former health minister Dan Poulter was referred to the panel concerning allegations of improper conduct towards female party colleagues. Kawczynski and Poulter deny any wrongdoing. Former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb is also under investigation regarding text messages sent to a 19-year-old woman who applied for a job in his office. He has apologised for inappropriate \u201csexual chatter\u201d. Former whip Christopher Pincher, the MP for Tamworth, has referred himself to the panel after being accused of making a pass at a party activist in 2001. He has denied the allegations. But letters sent out by the panel say that allegations received from complainants will be forwarded on to the accused but does not say they will be anonymised. One party official said: \u201cThis is not going to encourage anyone to come forward.\u201d Complainants have not yet been told the identity of the three panel members who will hear the cases. One said: \u201cAs far as I know, it could be the MP\u2019s mother. We need to be told.\u201d Letters inviting complainants to submit their claims within two weeks have been sent out by a party official. Contacted by the Guardian, the official declined to comment. According to the party\u2019s website, the party seeks written statements from complainants, notifies the respondent and seeks their reply. A panel consisting of no fewer than three people will examine the complaint and evidence gathered which should represent both the voluntary and professional party alongside at least one independent person. If the complaint regards an MP, the panel must include at least one person nominated by Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee. Jess Phillips, who chairs the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, said the Conservatives\u2019 failure to guarantee that complainants could remain anonymous shows a lack of knowledge and sensitivity. \u201cThe Conservatives desperately need to get a specialist to advise them. Accusations have to be made and answered in an investigation and it may very much be obvious to the accused who a person is, like in any employment grievance, but should the victim wish to have no reporting on their name then they should be able to request that.\u201d She also criticised May\u2019s working group, saying it should not be made up predominantly of frontbenchers, and called for it to include an independent specialist who understands sexual violence, assault and harassment. \u201cAt the moment, I still don\u2019t believe solving the problem is the priority. I still think politics seems to be the priority,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a massive worry to me. What hope is there if we don\u2019t get it right of changing the culture for people in law, media, the armed forces or elsewhere. If we don\u2019t get it right, that is really fatal for this moment in history when culture is on our side and we don\u2019t want to stand for it any more.\u201d Unite\u2019s parliamentary staff branch is also unhappy with the working group, saying there was a danger its members would have no confidence in the process because it will be dominated by MPs, with only two spaces set aside for staff representatives. The group, which is petitioning for trade union recognition of parliamentary and constituency staff, wrote to Leadsom saying its members were \u201cdeeply concerned and angry at several elements of this proposed process that must be changed if staff are to have confidence in the results\u201d. \u201cStaff do not have confidence that employers can take the lead in fixing this broken system,\u201d they said. \u201cSelf-regulation has failed for years. Unite\u2019s parliamentary branch is clear that this must be a staff-led process, and either the numbers of staff be balanced on the group or an outside expert body such as Acas be asked to review the whole system and make independent recommendations for a new system.\u201d It added: \u201cStaff need this system to be fixed to ensure a safe, decent and respectful workplace. Unite is committed to working to ensure this. We have no faith that the working group as currently constituted can achieve this vital change and would respectfully ask that you reconsider its composition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
