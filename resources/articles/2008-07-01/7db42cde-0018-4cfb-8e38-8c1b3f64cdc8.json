Born in California, the grandson of a stagecoach driver who fought off Apaches, the nine-year-old McCrea was taken by his family to Hollywood the year Cecil B DeMille arrived to make the first movie there in 1914. As a lad he delivered William S Hart's morning newspaper, and his only ambition was to be an actor in the movies. He rose rapidly from extra to supporting actor to star, his first real role being in DeMille's first talkie, Dynamite. Tall, rangy, conventionally handsome, he proved himself equally adept at comedy and drama, often in roles first offered to Gary Cooper or Cary Grant, though over the years he built up as formidable a filmography as either of them. He worked with most of the great directors of the time, including three times each with William Wyler and Preston Sturges, giving possibly his finest youthful performance as the comedy director who wants to make the deeply serious 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' in Sullivan's Travels (1941). The previous year he was better than Cooper would have been as the innocent American abroad in Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent Wells Fargo, one of the four pictures he made in 1937, was his first western, and from the mid-Forties until Sam Peckinpah's magnificent debut, the elegiac Ride the High Country (1962), he only made one picture outside the genre. He became one of the Mt Rushmore faces of the West, and in the Peckinpah picture he was joined by another great, Randolph Scott, to play ageing ex-lawmen on a final assignment in a transformed West. 'That was a great film for Randy and me to go out on,' he said. As always he played a man of probity. The cowboy-philosopher Will Rogers advised him: 'Save half of what you earn and live off the other half.' He and his wife for 57 years, the actress Frances Dee, became one of Hollywood's richest couples, living modestly and giving to good causes. They were quietly religious, and McCrea named as his favourite movie Stars in My Crown (1950), in which he played a gun-toting parson in a post-Civil War township. McCrea on McCrea 'People say I am a one-note actor, but the way I figure it, those other guys are just looking for that one note.' His greatest movie line 'All I want is to enter my house justified', says upright ex-Marshal Steve Judd in Ride the High Country, an echo of Luke 18:14 ('I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other...').
