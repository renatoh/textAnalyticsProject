The England captain, who has improved after a back spasm and expects to face Afghanistan at Old Trafford on Tuesday, is optimistic his first\u2011choice opener could be fit for the match against Australia at Lord\u2019s on 25 June. The extent of the left hamstring injury Roy suffered against West Indies last Friday has not been disclosed, however, despite talk of a possible grade two tear that would have a recovery period of two to six weeks depending on the damage to muscle fibres. Morgan, who confirmed James Vince will open in Roy\u2019s absence as England look to chalk up their fourth win in five games, said: \u201cI certainly believe Jason will play again in this tournament. \u201cAt the moment he\u2019s going to be assessed continuously over the course of the next week. He\u2019s out of the next two games. We\u2019ll see how he pulls up after that.\u201d On his own injury Morgan added: \u201cI\u2019m positive about playing. Unless I pull up worse tomorrow in the morning, I\u2019ll be in. If the game was today, I think I could play.\u201d Roy\u2019s injury highlights the opportunity squandered by Hales, who was ejected from the World Cup squad during the team\u2019s pre-season training camp in Cardiff following news of a second failed test for recreational drug use. Morgan asked for the views of his senior players before making that decision. Seven weeks on it appears the captain remains mindful of how any recall \u2013 albeit still hypothetical at this stage \u2013 would go down in the dressing room. Citing the seniority of the national selector, Ed Smith, on the subject, Morgan told BBC Sport: \u201cIf Smith came to myself and Trevor Bayliss and said he felt that Alex was the best option, we would have to assess how that would sit in the changing room and the stigma it would bring with Alex coming back in.\u201d Though not ruling anything out, Morgan\u2019s hesitance to speak definitively on the subject without discussing it with Smith or his players first is understandable. So, too, is the captain\u2019s disappointment at losing Roy in the short-term given he is averaging 77 in 2019 and struck 153 against Bangladesh two games ago. Hales, whose Nottinghamshire contract is for white-ball cricket only, has batted in two innings for the county since being excluded by England and would clearly be the best-qualified replacement with six ODI centuries. But he has instead presented Vince with a golden chance to prove his talent can transfer to international level. Vince will need to do so on Tuesday on the same pitch that India beat Pakistan on Sunday. There was considerable turn for Kuldeep Yadav in the second innings of Virat Kohli\u2019s sideIndia\u2019s 89-run DLS win and in Afghanistan\u2019s Rashid Khan, England\u2019s batsmen face a wrist-spinner of arguably greater quality. With training once again moved indoors on Monday due to rain, they were training using the Merlyn spin bowling machine. Morgan, who had a decent net session and showed no sign of discomfort in his back, will assess the pitch in the morning and said he may yet go against his usual preference to chase if he wins the toss. Liam Plunkett was absent from training because of illness and could be the bowler to make way if a second spinner, Moeen Ali, is required. Morgan denied suggestions that Adil Rashid, his first-choice slow bowler, is still struggling with the shoulder injury that required injections before the tournament. Morgan said: \u201cAdil has probably been at his best in the last two games. He\u2019s been unlucky. He\u2019s had two dropped catches. That might have affected how his figures look but how it\u2019s coming out of the hand is very impressive.\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s captain, Gulbadin Naib, admitted his side are lucky that Roy is missing and believes the pitch holds the key for Khan as his side look to secure their first win of the campaign and only a second in World Cup history. He said: \u201cRashid is not like other bowlers; he\u2019s an attacking bowler. Every time he\u2019s attacking. But the surfaces have not suited him. If this wicket is like it was between India and Pakistan, Rashid will be the success for Afghanistan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
