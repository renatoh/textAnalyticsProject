Now, after Ofcom ruled that Blake\u2019s website, dreamsofspanking.com, did not fall under Atvod\u2019s remit, she is free to reinstate its content. \u201cNow I\u2019ve won my appeal I feel vindicated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe war against intrusive and oppressive state censorship isn\u2019t over but this decision is a landmark victory for feminist porn, diversity and freedom of expression.\u201d \u201cIf you look at [Atvod\u2019s] archive, the sites they were ruling against, a lot of them were run by women,\u201d Blake said. \u201cIt did really feel like they were upholding a kind of patriarchal sexuality.\u201d Atvod, a quango which regulated video-on-demand websites, was stripped of its powers earlier this year. It had been widely criticised for acting against sites outside its remit and, after new rules were introduced in 2014 banning some sex acts in pornography, free speech campaigners also said it disproportionately acted against websites run by women. Blake had been among those who spoke out publicly against the Audio Visual Media Services regulations (AVMS), which in 2014 banned the depiction of sex acts that were judged morally damaging or life-threatening, including face-sitting, female ejaculation and spanking that leaves marks. She appeared in panel discussions on Newsnight and Women\u2019s Hour opposing the new rules. She says she was placed under investigation by Atvod soon after. In August 2015, after a five-month inquiry, she was forced to censor her website, which Atvod ruled had breached rules in three areas: a failure to pay regulatory fees, a lack of effective age controls to restrict access to over-18s, and the broadcast of harmful material. Atvod\u2019s investigation into her work had been traumatic, Blake said. \u201cMaking porn was part of an act of self-acceptance for me, to say I\u2019m not ashamed and to reach out to other people who share the same sort of fantasies,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, the films that I was making did show very honestly the sort of play that I enjoy in real life, it does include quite heavy impact with things like belts and canes \u2013 always consensual, but it does leave welts and bruises that might take a few days to heal.\u201d In a ruling published on Monday, Ofcom decided in favour of dreamsofspanking.com. A spokesperson said: \u201cOfcom found that the site was not a video-on-demand service and therefore it was not subject to regulation. When regulated video-on-demand services break our rules, we take robust action to protect children.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
