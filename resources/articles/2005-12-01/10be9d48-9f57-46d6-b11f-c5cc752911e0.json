As the Leopardstown crowd buzzed with astonishment, many racegoers were just too stunned to notice that the great champion had just struggled home fourth of the five runners. Jessica Harrington, his trainer, has not saddled a winner for nearly two months, and Moscow Flyer may have been suffering from the same malaise that has gripped his stablemates. The simple truth, though, is that he looked like a horse whose time is nearly up. Encouraged by upbeat bulletins from Harrington's yard, the punters sent Moscow Flyer off at 8-11, but he was never travelling with any real purpose and made one of his characteristic blunders at the fourth fence. He picked up ground over the third last, but his momentum dissipated when he hit the next, and victory was beyond him well before Loughran's embarrassing error grabbed everyone's attention. Some bookmakers have now pushed Moscow Flyer out to 5-1 to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase for a third time in March, when he will be 12 years old. Kauto Star, the Tingle Creek Chase winner, is the clear favourite for the race, at around 2-1. \"We'll have to see where we go with him now but we're not going to hurry with any decisions,\" Jessica Harrington, Moscow Flyer's trainer, said. \"Barry [Geraghty] said that he wasn't swinging along like he used to. We thought that he was back to himself but it seems that he wasn't, but he wasn't beaten far either and he was having a good blow afterwards. \"The [66-runner] losing run that we're on is the worst part of it, but what can I do, if the horses won't win, they won't win. They're starting to come back, but it will take a while. Moscow Flyer is still there and still galloping, and that's the main thing.\" The main target for Hi Cloy, who kept galloping on to win under Andrew McNamara while Loughran celebrated 80 yards too early on Central House, is the Grand National in April. Michael Hourigan, his trainer, concedes that as a Grade One winner, albeit a fortunate one, Hi Cloy will be saddled with plenty of weight at Liverpool, but believes the race will suit him. Irish bookmakers Cashmans cut him from 28-1 to 20-1 for the Aintree marathon. \"He was struggling all the way, but we were still in contention when we got to the fourth-last,\" McNamara said. \"When we made a mistake there I thought we were beaten, but when we straightened up he found another gear and he kept staying on all the time. \"I thought we were in with a chance at the last, but up the run-in I thought we were beaten and that Roger must have seen something. I don't know if I would have got there [otherwise].\" The Philip Rothwell-trained Black Apalachi, a 25-1 outsider, took easily the most valuable race on the card, the Paddy Power Handicap Steeplechase, a length clear of Camden Tanner, with Ross River back in third. The most interesting prospects yesterday with the spring Festivals in mind, however, were both novice hurdlers, and both from the yard of Noel Meade. Mr Nosie was a comfortable winner of the Grade Two Future Champions Novice Hurdle and remains unbeaten after three starts after jumping past Blueberry Boy at the last. He will be considered for the Royal &amp; SunAlliance Hurdle at Cheltenham, but a more significant performance on the undercard may have been the winning debut of Sweet Wake in the maiden hurdle. Sweet Wake was a Group Two winner in Germany on the Flat, and also ran well in a Group One event at Baden-Baden. He sauntered to victory under Paul Carberry yesterday, jumping with a fluency that often eludes the better Flat horses, and received a quote of 16-1 from Paddy Power and Boylesports for the Supreme Novice Hurdle. Meade admitted afterwards that Sweet Wake is \"towards the top\" of the pecking order among the novice hurdlers in his yard, which also includes recent Fairyhouse winner Iktitaf, another leading prospect for the Supreme. There was a sense as he talked, though, that Sweet Wake may soon sit at the top of the pile, and 16-1 could easily look like a very big price come the first day of the Festival. \"He's been like a rocket ever since we got him,\" said an animated Meade afterwards. \"He's never once been off the bridle in anything he's done at home, and nicer ground would suit him a lot better as he's got loads of toe. \"I just loved him from the moment I saw him at the Newmarket sales. I was bidding on another horse the day before that went for a huge amount of money, but I was pleased I didn't get that one in a way as this one was the next choice and I really wanted him.\" Sweet Wake carries the same colours as Sausalito Bay, who beat Best Mate to win the Supreme Novice Hurdle in 2000, and remains Meade's only winner at the Cheltenham Festival. With normal improvement, though, Sweet Wake could well be the next, and he could return to Leopardstown for a valuable novice hurdle at the Hennessy meeting in February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
