It just took most of the world two years to catch up. The classically trained Detroit singer and rapper racked up seven weeks at number one in the US this summer with her sleeper hit Truth Hurts, an exuberant flip-off to a loser ex which leapfrogged Cardi B\u2019s Bodak Yellow to become the longest-running solo female rap number one in US chart history. Much like Lil Nas X and his recent megahit Old Town Road, Lizzo\u2019s rise was powered by a groundswell of online support. In this spring\u2019s #DNATest challenge on social network TikTok, global users flipped the song\u2019s\u2019 indelible opening line into playful affirmations of their own cultural identities. (\u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% ... Arab,\u201d quips one young person, as her mum dances with a hookah pipe.) Lizzo\u2019s outspoken politics, body-positive message and irreverent persona chimes with many young music fans\u2019 desire for stars who reflect their own social values as well as churning out ear candy. That magnetism hasn\u2019t been lost on Hollywood, either: she cameoed in this autumn\u2019s crime caper Hustlers, starring Jennifer Lopez. Tonight, Brixton Academy seems like a blithely uncool hen party. Punters chug cans of pink cocktails outside the venue; the merch booth sells thongs emblazoned with \u201cJUICE\u201d in tribute to Lizzo\u2019s brilliant synthpop track; and dozens of fans wear bridal veils in a nod to Truth Hurts\u2019 wedding-themed video. The stage backdrop is painted to resemble a cathedral\u2019s stained glass and there\u2019s a DJ in a pulpit on which Lizzo, wearing a corseted gold leotard, occasionally twerks to deafening screams. As if daring heavenly powers to smite the venue with a lightning bolt, she promptly launches into the brassy funk of her cunnilingus manifesto Worship, on which she commands: \u201cWorship me / On your knees.\u201d In an efficient 80-minute show, Lizzo\u2019s pace and exuberance barely let up, allowing her to breeze through similar-sounding songs from her patchy album Cuz I Love You without the pace dragging (although a cover of Respect has a whiff of X Factor). She\u2019s flanked by four charismatic dancers, whose high-cut leotards enable Lizzo to affectionately squeeze their bare bums. On Good As Hell, an empowerment anthem as happily naff as a Netflix romcom, Lizzo embraces her squad and pogos on the balls of her feet, before giving them the floor during the trap-leaning Tempo for a braid-flipping dance-off, girl power style. After leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cI am my inspiration\u201d \u2013 a lyric from her 80s-inspired 2017 track Water Me, she hops on to a stool with a promise to spill \u201cthe tea\u201d. \u201cFuckboys don\u2019t love themselves,\u201d she informs the rapt crowd. \u201cLet the love you have for yourself shine brighter than any scrub.\u201d Later, she mimes drop kicking a bad boyfriend: \u201cWe don\u2019t got time for that in 2020, bitch!\u201d Lizzo\u2019s unadorned powerhouse vocals could recall gospel greats, but her live singing style has one red-lining volume level, which strips a song like her tortured break-up chronicle Jerome of the album version\u2019s nuance. In a poignant moment towards the end of the show, she talks of battling depressive episodes. \u201cI get lost sometimes,\u201d she says pensively. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the bitch who wrote an album about loving yourself!\u201d A little more of that self-reflection beyond the superwoman veneer would have been welcome. But when Lizzo re-emerges for a triumphant one-two punch of Truth Hurts and Juice, wearing spangly bell-bottoms that read \u201c100% That Bitch,\u201d she leaves little room for doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
