Take Bill Crompton, who slept every night for three months in the same cage as a young female elephant. \u2018He has since returned home,\u2019 noted Pavord (much to the relief of his wife). Anna, the young Indian elephant in question, had come to London Zoo too young, said Crompton. \u2018In the wild they are with their parents much longer.\u2019 Deciding the only thing to do was to stay and sleep with her, he found that each night Anna had \u2018her trunk over my legs so I didn\u2019t slip away in the night\u2019. But why elephants? \u2018They don\u2019t bite. I don\u2019t much care for things that bite.\u2019 Fair enough. And it was just as well Anna didn\u2019t roll over in the hay. Or snore. Also spare a thought for Mike Colbourne looking after the gorillas at Bristol zoo. His arrival in the cage each day was something of a relief to Delilah, Daniel\u2019s mother. She could offload the baby and play with Caroline, her friend next door. Mike was basically a gorilla babysitter with the upshot being that Samson, Delilah\u2019s mate, was kept next door. \u2018He\u2019s likely to view me as a potential rival and beat me up,\u2019 said Colbourne. Philip Glasier owned a falconry centre in Gloucestershire and had been a falcon expert for 50 years. He admitted that the methods of falconry hadn\u2019t changed much in 4,000 years, starting with the taming. \u2018You\u2019ve got to treat it quietly, gently and patiently.\u2019 Pavord was utterly captivated (so to speak) by their relationship: \u2018Man and bird are bound in a curiously hypnotic rhythm.\u2019 Harry Stevens, meanwhile, the keeper in charge of the rhinos at Whipsnade, was far less sentimental about his job. \u2018I don\u2019t really think they\u2019ve got much brain. Rustle a feed bag and they\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
