I'm under pressure at work to join the union, at a cost of around \u00a320 a month. I'm not sure I can afford it and anyway I've got an accident, sickness and unemployment insurance policy. I'm not really anti-union, but don't see why I should just cave in. What do I say to get the guy off my back? Or is it actually worth the money? You get Mondays off The fact that last Monday was a day off for millions of people is an old but great reason to join a union. Us union members get better rights and that includes more holidays. Four other reasons are: union staff are better paid; in times of strife (redundancy, re-organisation etc) unions are invaluable and act in your interest; unions can send you on courses, much to the envy of your non-union colleagues; you can even get a credit card from the union, which includes 0% balance transfers. All these reasons to join and there's no small print. Which is more than I can say for your carefully worded sickness and insurance policy. N Johal, East London We fought for it long ago Bear in mind when you decide that the terms and conditions you enjoy in the workplace today were hard-fought for over decades. By joining you will be acknowledging the work of countless unionists and also, more importantly, making sure that future generations of workers can experience the same benefits that you now have. \u00a320 a month is a small price to pay for this. Mark J Bartlett, Peterborough Stop whinging freeloader It's a bit like asking \"is it OK not to tax my car?\" I'm sure that you will be quite happy to accept the longer holidays, better wages and improved working conditions that are associated with a unionised workplace. Effectively, you will be freeloading on the union members within the workplace whose contributions achieve these benefits. And I don't think your insurance will help you much if you run across an abusive, bullying manager. Join the union and stop whinging. Ian Soady, Birmingham You're lucky to have one In most workplaces today the reverse is the case: pressure - covert and overt - is applied by bosses to deny workers their basic human right to belong to a trades union. Witness the less than subtle tactics used by some major employers in the UK to effect this. Consider, also, the antics of Walmart across the Atlantic, ruthlessly closing stores where staff have voted to join a union. As for your comment that \u00a320 a month is possibly unaffordable, it is either highly unlikely or a scandal waiting to be exposed (there is now a minimum wage) and all the more reason why you should be a union member. Payment of union subs is not a \"cost\", it is, among other things, an investment in workplace protection, legal advice and representation, and economic advancement. Jim McCabe, Bootle, Merseyside Alright, Jack? Why not go the whole hog and dismiss any notion of human solidarity, embracing the Thatcherite principle of there being \"no such thing as society\", since you are alright, Jack? Frankie Green, by email It's a waste of money Don't waste your money! Unions are an unnecessary evil in the modern world. Keep paying into an insurance policy. My wife paid her subscription to the National Union of Teachers for 23 years. When she was bullied and intimidated by her headteacher she asked for legal help. The union failed to help her and she used her home insurance policy, which covered legal advice, to obtain legal representation at an employment tribunal. My wife is now suing the NUT for breach of contract, duty of care and negligence. Don't join a union. PB You won't regret it There's power in the union. As a part-time tutor paid by the hour in higher education I had little motivation to join my union - especially since I was earning so little. However, a colleague talked me into joining and since membership fees are staggered according to income, it cost me less than I expected. A few months after joining I was locked in a dispute with my employer over non-payment of additional teaching. My union rep stepped in and dealt with the matter swiftly and professionally. I am pretty sure that without the union on my side I would never have received the payment I was owed and I am now a loyal union member. I would recommend joining. Rosie, East Sussex What are you, a lawyer? If you are a qualified barrister in employment law, if you have total control over your work environment, if you have built up a vibrant support network there, and if you are dedicated to protecting your own - and only your own - interests, then don't think about it. If not, join! JK McCarthy NW6 They won me \u00a340,000 Union membership is also like an insurance policy. You hope you will never have to claim on it but union support can be invaluable if you do. When I got into difficulties with my former employer my union backed me all the way to an employment tribunal and won nearly \u00a340,000 compensation. Cheryl Smith, by email It's about more than insurance As a result of negotiations by paid-up union members, all the company's employees are able to enjoy benefits such as acceptable annual pay rises and more flexible working hours. Without any union members we would all be at the mercy of whatever working conditions the company wished to impose on us. It seems that people are happy to overlook this when calculating the \"value\" to themselves of union membership. Surely the more union members there are within a company or industry, the stronger the voice asking for even more wide-ranging and beneficial changes for all? Being a member of a union really is more than simply insurance for your own job. Elizabeth Dalby, Wolverhampton Ask not... Ask not what the union can do for you, but what you can do for the union. It's not an alternative to insurance, it got you the rights, pay and conditions you enjoy today. As for the cost, most unions have additional benefits - my cheaper mortgage rate pays for my membership subscription. Lesley Hall, Wiltshire In case of dismissal In the event of disciplinary proceedings against you, your union will be there for you, at no extra cost. Should matters go as far as dismissal then at industrial tribunal the union will represent you. This may seem a negative view but, believe me, these things can and do happen. Annie Cooper, Aldershot Don't be a scrounger No one likes a free-loader. Although it is unlikely these days, that any of your workmates will openly take issue with you, you can bet your bottom dollar that behind your back they despise your being tight-fisted and not playing the game. That's how it works in my workplace! Do the decent thing, if it is a problem with the thought of union membership, make your position clear and set up a standing order to a reputable charity to pay a similar amount as your workmates pay the union for their - and your - working conditions. M R Teece, Nottingham You smug, comfortable, rich git Union membership fees are graded according to income. If you were joining my union, fees of \u00a320 a month would mean you were taking home in the region of \u00a32000 a month. For this they represent you when negotiating pay and pensions, redundancy, personal disputes, industrial tribunals etc. You could sit smugly and let other people pay for the collective negotiations (many of whom are less well-off than yourself) but remember that if everyone did that there would have been no-one to negotiate your (apparently) comfortable salary. Carole Langley, Bristol It's worth it It's money well spent. For a weekly amount that wouldn't even buy you a cup of coffee and a glossy magazine you safeguard your right to help, advice and even representation in all employment matters. Who are you going to turn to if your employer suddenly varies your contract, sells out to a bigger organisation or tries to sack you because you are pregnant? What if they decide your face doesn't fit the organisation anymore, or if you find yourself facing a disciplinary hearing? If you're finding it difficult to say no to your union rep, you might find it even trickier to stand up for yourself in an employment tribunal. Keep your \u00a320 if you must, but remember that access to such services don't come much cheaper.
