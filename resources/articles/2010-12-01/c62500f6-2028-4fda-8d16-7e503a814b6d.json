And the outbreak of winter flu, which mainly involves an increasing prevalence of H1N1 swine flu infection, is likely to continue causing sometimes serious sickness until the end of January. \"We are still on the upward trajectory. We probably haven't quite reached the peak yet,\" said Dr Meirion Evans, of the UK Faculty of Public Health, which represents public health doctors working in the NHS, local councils and academia. \"My guess is that it will reach a peak either this week or early next week, and will then start coming down. But we will continue to see seasonal flu around for most of January. So it's still got four to five weeks to run.\" Evans, a public health consultant and consultant epidemiologist in Cardiff, is also a member of the scientific advisory committee on pandemic flu, which advises the government on how to prevent outbreaks. The number of people affected has been increasing for about three weeks, he added. But he said the next seven days should bring the high point of the winter flu season, which usually lasts for six to eight weeks. While seasonal flu usually begins in earnest at the start of January, this year it struck in early December, although experts cannot explain why. Hospitals are preparing for worse to come and senior doctors insist last year's major outbreak of swine flu has left them ready. \"The NHS is well-placed to manage what may well yet prove to be an unprecedented demand for critical care as a result of seasonal flu,\" said Dr Bob Winter, the president of the Intensive Care Society. \"The public should be reassured that there are [critical care] beds available at the moment and, should it be required, there are well-rehearsed plans to double critical care capacity if needed.\" Winter added: \"At the moment seasonal flu is a pressure but not yet a problem.\" Last week brought a doubling in those receiving critical care in hospitals to 460, and a jump from 10 to 27 deaths attributed to flu \u2013 24 of which involved H1N1. Those figures go up to last Thursday. The latest batch of statistics from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), due tomorrow, are likely to show a jump. Winter said: \"I'm not getting a sense generally that things have gone ballistic.\" But parts of the NHS are under greater pressure than others. \"There are clusters of swine flu. For example, the north-west had 117 cases in the week before Christmas whereas the east Midlands, with a comparable population, had 42,\" he said. Hospitals across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are generally coping well, he added. The NHS in those three countries is divided into 29 different critical care networks \u2013 groups of neighbouring hospitals that help each other if there is a sudden spike in demand for beds. Winter said the networks were \"tight on beds\", but all had some spare. In other words, this winter's outbreak of seasonal flu \u2013 mainly swine flu \u2013 has not caused anything like the problems that H1N1, then a new virus, did in the months after it first arrived here early in 2009. Winter, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, said there were empty critical care beds in the network that his hospital belonged to, which covers Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Burton-on-Trent. \"I wouldn't over-egg this,\" he added. \"Swine flu is just another form of seasonal flu, and we usually get 3,000 deaths a year from seasonal flu. Swine flu is just one of the three strains [of flu] circulating.\" Winter's own hospital has 17 intensive care beds and 16 high-dependency beds. Just four or five of those 33 have been occupied at any time in the three weeks since flu began circulating again. He dismissed media reports that some elective surgery procedures, including cancer operations, had been postponed as swine flu put pressure on critical care capacity. The usual winter rises in car accidents and breathing conditions lay behind the few recent delays, he insisted. Sandwell hospital in West Bromwich and its sister, City hospital in Birmingham, have been \"busy with seasonal flu\", according to Richard Kirby, the chief operating officer of their NHS trust. There are three patients in critical care at each hospital \u2013 three men and three women \u2013 and another seven children have been left very unwell, mainly due to H1N1. Isolating patients known or suspected to have flu has posed problems, said Kirby, with side rooms and two- or three-bed bays given over to diagnosing and treating them without fear of contamination. But Kirby said broken legs, hips and arms caused by falls on ice and snow had so far proved more demanding than flu. The trust has had to put on extra sessions of emergency trauma surgery, and last week treated between 12 and 20 patients for fractures. So far it has not put in place any special measures to cope with flu. Meanwhile, the parents of Natalie Hill, 17, who died on 15 December after catching swine flu, have described her as \"a blessing in so many ways\". Michael and Carol Hill said she had been in Hull Royal Infirmary because of complications caused by a rare condition she had had since she was born."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
