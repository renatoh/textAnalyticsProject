She knows so much about living with relentless pressure that making significant, split\u2011second decisions comes as second nature. It is all just another part of her job as an Everton and England player. For the moment, though, there are no adrenaline highs, no trophies to pursue and no need to provide constant proof she deserves her place in the starting lineup. On one level, lockdown has been immensely frustrating but it has also afforded the 28-year-old midfielder time to reflect on a renewed love for the game and a new-found determination to promote social justice. On Friday, Christiansen joins Common Goal. It is a collective social-impact movement enabling anyone involved in the world game to donate at least 1% of their salary to a network of football-based community projects supporting young people in more than 90 countries. Of the 153 players and managers signed up \u2013 Juan Mata and J\u00fcrgen Klopp included \u2013 more than 50% are female. Considering the often vast gender disparity in salaries, that represents quite a statement. As Christansen sits at home, addressing a Zoom-linked computer screen against a backdrop of French art before preparing to head out for one-to-one training with a conditioning coach, she looks anything but surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to women footballers that we\u2019re role models,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives you an insight into the type of people we are. We\u2019ve fought battles throughout our careers to change perceptions. Common Goal is so relevant to us.\u201d The sincerity radiating through the screen emphasises this is not virtue signalling, a point reinforced when it becomes apparent her desire to support sanitation projects in developing countries is intensely personal. Her younger sister, Rosie, a recently graduated medical student in Glasgow, is working long, stressful hours on hospital wards as part of the first of two foundation years prefacing qualification as a doctor. \u201cMy sister did a master\u2019s degree in tropical medicine and came back from Africa with some incredible insights,\u201d Christiansen says. \u201cIt sparked my interest in Common Goal projects and how they can help sanitation across the world. In poorer countries sanitation is massive \u2013 and not just in the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a while but lockdown has give me time to both assess what I want and to live a different way.\u201d It has also left her missing Rosie horribly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult to support her. She\u2019s on her own, a long way away and working long shifts. It\u2019s difficult for me because she\u2019s a very close friend, not just a sister. She\u2019s on the frontline, doing an amazing job.\u201d Christiansen must wait to return to centre stage after a disappointment-punctuated year. A treble winner with Lyon in 2019, she sat out last summer\u2019s World Cup in France after fracturing a fibula and damaging ankle ligaments in March of that year. In December she joined Everton as very much Willie Kirk\u2019s marquee signing only for the pandemic to bring an end to the WSL season. The irony is that, after a tough induction at Lyon when she briefly considered quitting football, the Birmingham University sports science graduate has fallen in love with the game again. Norway\u2019s Ada Hegerberg helped Christiansen through the dark days and the Lyon striker has influenced her Common Goal decision. \u201cI\u2019m the first Everton player to join so I\u2019d like to think it can set an example to my teammates because football\u2019s a really powerful tool for change,\u201d she says. \u201cAda\u2019s someone I look up to; she\u2019s not afraid to speak up and fight for what she believes in. I\u2019ve always had a voice, I just haven\u2019t necessarily had the confidence to use it. But now I think that if you believe in something or can contribute to change for the better then it\u2019s important to speak up. As footballers, we\u2019re in a very privileged position. People look up to us. We have to make sure we deliver key messages.\u201d She cannot wait for football to return. \u201cThe days are just drifting by, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going \u2013 I haven\u2019t even watched much TV,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot of dog walking, a lot of reading.\u201d Christiansen remains optimistic the previously burgeoning women\u2019s game will recover strongly from the coronavirus-induced pause. \u201cWSL players are world-class, teams are getting stronger and everyone\u2019s hunger and excitement about returning will naturally increase the league\u2019s level,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some ways, we could end up looking back on this time of self-reflection as a blessing in disguise. \u201cBut I\u2019m constantly looking ahead now. I can\u2019t wait to get back to training, to a normal routine and weekend fixtures. When it\u2019s taken away, you realise how much you miss it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
