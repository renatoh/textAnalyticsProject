It was disgusting\u2019", "bodyText": "I remember once spending a Christmas with a friend\u2019s family as our guests and as they arrived the electricity went off in the house. I had to phone the next door neighbour (who\u2019d gone to his parents\u2019 home with his wife and kids) and ask: \u201cPlease can I let myself in and cook my turkey in your oven?\u201d In the spirit of things, he said: \u201cOf course.\u201d My very first memory is of Marie biscuits. They were in a green packet, thin and like Rich Tea biscuits but with more writing. We\u2019d always have butter on top. It\u2019s a very Welsh thing, putting butter on your sweet Maries. I was born on Easter Sunday and raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, by my mother, a housewife and sometime house cleaner, and my father, a bricklayer and great general builder, in a village [Aberbargoed] in the Rhymney Valley where the colliery had recently closed. The dining table was in the middle of the narrow galley kitchen, which led to our downstairs bathroom. We always ate there and Dad would start every meal with a prayer, based on what had been going on that day. Very personal, individual and sometimes sad. On Saturday mornings, if it wasn\u2019t torrential rain \u2013 and it needed to be torrential for us not to go \u2013 we were knocking on peoples\u2019 doors, Witnessing. I hated it, if I\u2019m honest, not least because I was bullied at school. There were times when we knocked on the homes of the parents of children who bullied me at school. You\u2019d see kids sat in front of the box having their cereals, doing what I wanted to be doing on a Saturday morning \u2013 watching Why Don\u2019t You\u2026? with a bowl of Frosties. I was a terribly fussy eater when I was a kid. All the things that kids generally like, such as baked beans, bacon and sausages, I didn\u2019t like. And all vegetables. I\u2019m an only child and I think that might have been the problem. When you haven\u2019t any siblings you don\u2019t have to worry that they\u2019ll eat your food. I had a real problem with food. I hated eggs and would vomit at the smell of carrots. But that all changed at 12 or 13 \u2013 I started to eat everything. That was also when kebab shops started trickling up the valleys. I remember when a great one arrived in Aberbargoed and kebabs became our treats. I loved baking with my mother. I would pretend that we were on a cookery programme and the galley kitchen wall was the audience and cameras, and my mother would give me a wine glass with some lemonade in it, like Keith Floyd. I\u2019d make her have all the ingredients of the cake measured out in separate bowls and she was my cooking assistant. I called her Doreen and she used to go with it. I still call Mum Doreen sometimes, when she gets on my nerves. I moved out of home to Cardiff when I was 16 and employed a voice coach for my singing while working at a finance company. A slightly older woman there wanted to move to London and I did too, so at 17 I was sharing with her in London, while studying at the London Studio Centre. She was a terrible cook. I don\u2019t think she ever ate in the house, but she certainly used to drink a lot. I did musical theatre for eight years. In the West End on matinee days I would finish around 4.30pm, and go to a dumpling house on the edge of Chinatown and have a plate of sweet dumplings with vinegar, soy sauce and chilli and probably buy myself some jelly candy to get me through the evening performance. After the show we\u2019d go to a bar and drink and then I would get a kebab to eat on the number 19 bus home. I drink a lot of liquorice tea for the singing voice. There can be immediate comfort in food. When I\u2019ve been away filming, the very first thing I want when I arrive home is bread, frozen in the freezer, and baked beans from the cupboard. I really miss my baked beans on toast. I think I\u2019m pretty self-critical about my acting \u2013 because I want to do it better the next time \u2013 and the same is true in the kitchen. When I\u2019m at home, with Mum especially, I\u2019ll say lots of things like: \u201cIt\u2019s better to get a chicken from the freezer that\u2019s had a better life because it will taste better, Doreen.\u201d The best catering on a film I\u2019ve acted in is a toss-up between Beauty and the Beast and Fast &amp; Furious 6. Great chefs making great food: Mexican fare, Mediterranean steaks; one time a huge pig was roasted for lunch on a spit. It was pretty extraordinary. Back on [the film] Tamara Drewe, which was shot through October-November in lovely Dorset, we had a big and very nice celebration one night with fireworks and a big pig-roast out in the fields in the countryside. I had to drink Charles Dance\u2019s blood in Dracula Untold. It was actually a mixture of beetroot juice and cherry juice to give it that viscosity. So it was thick and gloopy, because I had to have congealing blood on my teeth, lips and chin. Drinking it was supposed to almost kill my character, and it was disgusting to taste. Some of the best meals I\u2019ve eaten have been at Ian McKellen\u2019s house in New Zealand \u2013 where I lived for much of a year (making The Hobbit). Ian had a wonderful man called Steve who looked after him, drove him, helped him with his lines and this guy could cook the most incredible food. If you were invited over to Ian\u2019s after shooting or on a weekend for dinner, you knew you were going to leave feeling very content indeed. My favourite things Food There\u2019s nothing quite like a kebab with the meat cooked incredibly well, from a good Turkish restaurant, with beautiful salads, garnishes and sauces. That\u2019s lush, that. Drink I like an Aperol spritz and enjoy a good shiraz. And love a vermentino cinque terre \u2013 which I drank a lot of while making a movie last summer in Portofino. Dish to make I can make a full roast dinner, for 10. Three roast chickens \u2013 one with garlic, one with lemon and one with honey. With roast potatoes, honey-glazed parsnips and pears. On time and no problem. Luke Evans\u2019s debut album At Last is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
