Young has not been selected since the end of last month when he started the 1-1 draw at Leicester City. Yet despite being named in the squad for each of the following three fixtures Young remained an unused replacement in the goalless draw with West Ham United, the 3-2 defeat at Wolfsburg in the Champions League and the defeat by Bournemouth. Young had been carrying a minor injury, though he was passed fit to start against Bournemouth and again ended the defeat on the bench. This was understood to have been a surprise to Young who had expected to play. Van Gaal\u2019s decision not to start him at right-back against Wolfsburg had also been unexpected. Instead the Dutchman opted to give Guillermo Varela his full debut in a game United had to win to be sure of qualifying from the group to the last 16. Two minutes before half-time the manager could have again fielded Young when Matteo Darmian was replaced but instead Van Gaal sent on Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, an 18-year-old with only 14 minutes of senior football for the club. As well as United dropping into the Europa League their poor form has left them six points behind the leaders, Leicester City, and many are questioning the morale at the club. Yet David de Gea has claimed the mood is fine. \u201cThere\u2019s a great atmosphere,\u201d the goalkeeper said. \u201cThe dressing room is very together and united. I think that\u2019s really important in a team if it wants to achieve big things. That\u2019s what we all want, to stay up near the top, and to get to April and be in a position where we can win the league. \u201d De Gea also defended captain Wayne Rooney, saying \u201cwhen things are going badly it\u2019s always him who speaks up and encourages us. He\u2019s the club captain and he\u2019s the one who has to do the talking and motivate us. That\u2019s what he always does.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
