Hicks and his fellow co-owner, George Gillett, have been seeking new investment of varying forms for almost two years and the US financial management company was employed to carry out that task by Hicks last year. It is understood the firm is now targeting businesses or wealthy individuals in the Middle East who would be prepared to buy a minority stake, allowing the Americans Hicks and Gillett to retain majority control. The co-owners value the club at \u00a3500m, despite postponing the proposed new stadium indefinitely in the current economic climate, but a minority shareholding would come at a discount. Despite a controversial and often fraught tenure, Hicks and Gillett remain intent on bringing the stadium proposals to fruition and recently extended their refinancing package on the club to July 2010. Their reign continues to attract fierce protests from Liverpool supporters and the Spirit of Shankly group, which held an EGM on Saturday to discuss intensifying its campaign against the Americans, met the club's managing director, Christian Purslow, to reinforce its concerns before last night's Champions League game against Debrecen. Unusually Hicks, Gillett and Purslow have all gone public in the past week with messages on the improved health of Liverpool's finances. This follows the biggest commercial agreement in the club's history, a four-year shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered bank, which is believed to be worth \u00a320m a year. Hicks vowed to continue reducing Liverpool's debt, which is scheduled to decrease by \u00a360m to \u00a3250m under the terms of the latest refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia, and revealed that an arrangement with Carlsberg will continue to bring around \u00a36m a year into the club when the brewer's deal as main sponsor ends next summer. The Texan also claimed there is new-found stability at Anfield. \"I think the management situation at the club has dramatically improved. There is a real sense of optimism,\" he said. Hicks also championed Liverpool's value as a global brand with a history of success, while dismissing the spending of the Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City as \"not sustainable\". Gillett went on record at the weekend to state that: \"The club is in outstanding shape. Economically, it's never been stronger. We just paid down our debt very substantially. We have less debt per dollar than any club in the league.\" Liverpool posted a record turnover of \u00a3159.1m for the year ending July 2008 but the club's parent company, Kop Football (Holdings) Limited, suffered a \u00a342.6m loss for the same period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
