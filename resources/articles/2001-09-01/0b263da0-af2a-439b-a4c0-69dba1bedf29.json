In his third game as captain Giggs was dismissed after 85 minutes for a late tackle on Roar Strand, his second bookable offence after having been cautioned earlier for dissent. Afterwards a subdued Giggs said: \"Yes, it was my first [sending off], and yes at any level. But I don't want to talk about it.\" It came two minutes after the substitute Frode Johnsen had settled the result, leaving Wales without a win in 12 games, matching the runs between May 1968 and April 1970 and March 1896 and February 1900. The end was in sharp contrast with Wales' fine start. After 10 minutes Giggs, Simon Davies and Steve Jenkins combined well and, when Ronnie Johnsen headed away the resulting cross, Robbie Savage met the ball with a dipping volley into the top corner from 25 yards. Ronnie Johnsen atoned seven minutes later. Paul Jones could only parry a first-time effort from Johnsen's Manchester United colleague Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Johnsen hooked in the equaliser. Craig Bellamy restored the lead in the 27th minute, firing home when Thomas Myhre could only half stop Giggs' drive from the edge of the area. Bellamy was a whisker away from increasing the advantage before the interval with a dipping shot from 20 yards. After the break Wales conceded too much space in midfield and Norway steadily increased the pressure. It eventually told in the 65th minute when John Carew, a first-half replacement for Steffen Iversen, who fell heavily on an ankle after an aerial challenge, tapped in from Oyvind Leonhardsen's cross. Norway (4-4-2): Myhre; Basma, R Johnsen, Berg, Riise; R Strand, Sorensen, Leonhardsen, Rudi; Solskjaer, Iversen. Wales (4-4-2): P Jones; Delaney, Page, Symons, Jenkins; Savage, C Robinson, Davies, Giggs; Bellamy, Hartson. Referee : F Stuchlik (Aut)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
