A prime example of this curve is 'top comedian' Russell Brand who has built a career on having given up heroin. A little bit of giving up can take you a very long way these days and Brand is everywhere attempting jokes and telling everyone of his love of West Ham. Since he has become ubiquitous, West Ham have become useless. His ascendancy has coincided with the club's decline. Brand, clearly, is to blame for the nineteenth richest club in the world being eighteenth in the Premiership and five points shy of safety after yesterday's feeble performance. Either he goes or they go down. Watford had not scored for 200 minutes but they edged the first 10 minutes, being driven on and forward by their captain Gavin Mahon who is as menacing as he is bald. West Ham appeared twitchy. Manager Alan Curbishley had said it was a must- win game and his use of the imperative might have unsettled his team. Certainly it had a malign effect on Anton Ferdinand who made a miserable attempt to leave the ground to head clear and then grappled Darius Henderson to the ground. Referee Alan Wiley gave Watford their first penalty of the season and Henderson struck it low and into the corner to Robert Green's right. It was the striker's first goal for 25 games. Before 20 minutes had gone the home fans were chanting for Carlos Tevez. And little wonder. Their team seemed bereft of skill and application and, most crucially, confidence. They forced corners but failed to test Ben Foster. Their best chance falling to Bobby Zamora who sliced his first-time effort over the bar after Nigel Reo-Coker's shot had skewered wide. Lucas Neill, the 50-grand-a-week man, hobbled off. On the pitch Zamora dispossessed Foster as he attempted to roll the ball out but the linesman felt he had done so unfairly. Just before half-time Foster was forced to make his first save, a fine effort denying the increasingly influential Yossi Benayoun. But an even better chance went to Malky Mackay at the other end only for him to head over. Tevez came on and almost had an immediate impact curling a free-kick over the bar. His presence also acted as an inspiration on Benayoun and Matthew Etherington. Suddenly there was some urgency. Tevez wriggled into the area, took the ball round Foster but his shot was cleared off the line by Mackay. And then, seemingly, a break for West Ham. Nigel Reo-Coker burst into the area and was crunched by Mahon. Marlon Harewood stepped up for the penalty, Foster went one way, the ball went the other, but wide of the post. The curse of Brand. And perhaps a defining moment of West Ham's season. After failing to score a penalty, against Watford, in a must-win game, they subsided. And Watford clung on for their first away win of the season, Damien Francis coming nearer to doubling the lead than West Ham to equalising. 'You're not fit to wear the shirt,' sang the fans. Man of the match: Malky Mackay Solid and dependable against his former club. The big centre-back's clearance off the line from the Argentine Carlos Tevez guaranteed his team three points. And he even went close to scoring, but his header went over the bar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
