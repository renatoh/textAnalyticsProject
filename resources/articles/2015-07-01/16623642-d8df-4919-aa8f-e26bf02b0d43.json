An NFL spokesperson said Tuesday in a statement that Bell has been suspended without pay for the first two games of the regular season. The All-Pro running back had initially been handed a three-game ban in connection with his August arrest on DUI and marijuana charges following a traffic stop with then-teammate LeGarrette Blount. The 23-year-old Ohio native pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 15 months of probation and entered into a diversion program. \u201cLe\u2019Veon made a mistake and now he must learn from his mistake and focus on eliminating distractions from his life,\u201d Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with Le\u2019Veon to try to help him reach his full potential as a person and as a player.\u201d Bell will be eligible to return to Pittsburgh\u2019s active roster on 21 September following the team\u2019s Week 2 game against the San Francisco 49ers. He is coming off a breakout sophomore campaign that saw him carry 290 times for 1361 yards and eight touchdowns, while making 83 receptions for 854 yards and three additional scores."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
