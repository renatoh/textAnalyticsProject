Mr Justice Roderic Wood, who said that he was \"very concerned\" about the children, asked for help from the public finding Jessica, Tomas, Eva and David Palacin Jones, aged between eight and 14, whom he described as vulnerable. The children had been in the care of their Spanish father Tomas Palacin Cambra, 52, who lives in Mallorca, according to the judge. However, he said that their mother, Jennifer Jones, 46, had abducted the children and defied a high court order to return them to her estranged husband, He had ordered the children's immediate removal from their mother at a high court hearing on Monday but police officers who went to Jones's house in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on Tuesday found that she and the children were not there. \"All these children are now missing,\" the judge told a hearing in the family division of the high court in London. \"The mother removed them from her home in the middle of the night. Her and her children's whereabouts are unknown. I do not know the mother's intentions.\" He ruled that Jessica, 14, Tomas, 12, Eva, nine, and David, eight, could be identified and authorised solicitors representing Palacin Cambra to release photographs. Lawyers said that Jones, who teaches English as a second language, and the children were thought to be with her partner, John Williams. Another family division judge, Mr Justice Hedley, ruled last week that Jones had abducted the children from her estranged husband's care in Spain for the second time. The first occasion was in 2009. Jones had been ordered to return the children to Spain by midnight on Friday 12 October but had not done so. An elder daughter, Sara Maria, 16, has already returned to Spain. Palacin Cambra's legal team said he had not seen his children since they came to Britain at the end of June and said that they would be returning to the high court on Wednesday if the children were not located overnight. Mr Justice Wood said Jones had been at a high court hearing in London on Monday. \"The mother came to my court yesterday and argued through her barrister that the order of Mr Justice Hedley ... should be set aside,\" he added. \"I declined to set that order aside.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
