In a withering attack on the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Guy Verhofstadt dismissed the idea that he could dump Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, withhold payment of the UK\u2019s \u00a339bn divorce bill and still negotiate a free-trade deal in Brussels as a \u201cmyth\u201d. And he said that, years after the referendum, Johnson was \u201ca man who continues to dissemble, exaggerate and disinform\u201d. Verhofstadt\u2019s assessment, which is shared by most European officials, is the most forceful European intervention so far into the Tories\u2019 leadership election. In an article published by the Project Syndicate website and the Guardian, the former prime minister of Belgium concludes that Johnson and his rival, Jeremy Hunt, who also claims to be able to to renegotiate the Brexit deal, have \u201clearned nothing whatsoever\u201d from the last two years. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the agreement and that the UK will crash out unless the House of Commons ratifies the full package, including the protocol containing the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. But Johnson has said he believes that with \u201cpositive energy\u201d he will be able to either persuade Brussels to ditch the backstop, which would otherwise keep the UK in a customs union until another border solution is found, or agree to a \u201cstandstill\u201d in current relations through article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. The latter claim has been described as \u201cnot true\u201d by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, among others. He pointed out article 24 requires EU agreement, which Brussels has said it will not give. EU officials and diplomats close to the last two years of talks have looked on aghast at the hardening of Johnson\u2019s positions around what they regard as unfeasible proposals. Sources echoed Verhofstadt\u2019s concerns on Thursday, saying that they feared an early visit to Brussels by Johnson, on becoming prime minister, could lock both sides into a no-deal Brexit. Officials said it would be desirable for Johnson to instead tour the EU capitals in order to gain a sense of what might be realistic before seeking concessions. One EU diplomat said there would be a natural desire to give a new prime minister a hearing but that there increasingly seemed little hope of reaching an accommodation. \u201cIs the withdrawal agreement really dead?\u201d asked one. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cYou could possibly foresee add-ons to the deal to offer aspirational timelines for getting out of the Irish backstop,\u201d said the source. \u201cMaybe he could sell it at home. But Johnson is backing himself more into a corner every day.\u201d EU diplomats said they recognised that much of Johnson\u2019s positioning was designed to put the blame on the bloc for a no-deal exit. One diplomat said: \u201cWithout the withdrawal treaty there will be no standstill transition. It is in the draft treaty, nowhere else. The idea that the EU would stand by as Britain tears up a painstakingly negotiated treaty and then say, \u2018Hey have a transition anyway,\u2019 is frankly ridiculous. \u201cIs Johnson serious? I hope he understands what he\u2019s on about because no else does. \u201cIt is nonsense and is presumably meant to be incomprehensible for the purposes of his campaign unless he is completely divorced from reality.\u201d In his article, Verhofstadt described Johnson in similar terms, saying that he appeared to be unable to stop spreading \u201cuntruths\u201d. He added: \u201cChief among them is the myth that Britain can tear up the withdrawal agreement that May negotiated with the EU, withhold its financial commitments to the bloc and simultaneously start negotiating free-trade deals. \u201cTo Johnson\u2019s followers, however, he is more prophet than politician: only he can deliver a mythical \u2018true Brexit\u2019 that will deliver the prosperity promised during the referendum campaign. \u201cAs is often the case with populists, reality does not square with Johnson\u2019s ensorcelling combination of false promises, pseudo-patriotism and foreigner-bashing. \u201cHe and his fellow Brexiteers speak of a \u2018global Britain\u2019 that will trade freely with the rest of the world, even as they drag their country down a path strewn with uprooted trade ties and substantial new barriers to commerce.\u201d The EU is due to announce the finalising of a trade deal with the Mercosur bloc \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay \u2013 that will reduce tariffs on European products being exported to those countries. The EU has been keen to burnish its trade credentials after enjoying a purple patch of negotiations, including with Japan, with which it has struck the world\u2019s largest bilateral free-trade deal. \u201cWith Johnson likely taking power in late July, Europe will have offered still more proof that Brexit is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to Britain\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Verhofstadt writes. \u201cThe \u2018buccaneering\u2019 Brexiteers might then finally have to explain what it is they\u2019re still complaining about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
