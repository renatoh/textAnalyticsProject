A minute or so later, I was bundled to the ground by two policemen, handcuffed, pushed into a police van, taken to the police station, questioned for hours, and only released seven hours later. At the same time, my bedsit, and my landlady's house were searched by the police. I had gone into a branch in Northamptonshire to withdraw \u00a3200 on my Barclaycard - it was money to pay for the rent on my lodgings. I handed my card over in the normal way, asking for the money. I was given it, without any odd questions asked. Then, without any warning, the police charged in and I was handcuffed and arrested. I did not resist - for a man, I am relatively short and weigh less than 10 stone. While I was at the police station, I did not know what to do. I had never been arrested before, so I didn't have any idea what my rights were or who to phone. I was accused of taking money from someone else's account - a Mr B who lived in the town. No one explained how I was supposed to have done this. The card I used had my own name and signature on it. I had no idea who Mr B was. Eventually, the police said they had spoken to Mr B who said he had no accounts with Barclays and had neither lost any cards nor had them stolen. After seven hours, I was released on bail to reappear in mid-February. I was too shaken to do anything. I was really worried what my fianc\u00e9e might think. But although I was innocent, I did not want Barclays to discipline the cashier whose mistake started this all off. Eventually, my family protested to Barclays on my behalf. Earlier this month, Barclays wrote to apologise, offering me \u00a31,000 in full and final settlement. What do you think of this amount? And why was I in this situation? VH, Nottingham Money is never a sufficient balm for what you experienced. But it can help a little, as well as sending a signal to Barclays that it needs to improve the way it deals with customers. And the Barclays offer is too low. It appears there was an error in issuing your card - you say this was the first time you had used this particular card in a bank branch. This mistake flashed up when the cashier processed your card. She was not at fault. But Barclays, in common with other banks, has staff guidelines. These suggest you should have been told something like there was a small computer problem, and then taken to one side or invited into a private room until the difficulty was sorted out. Instead, someone pressed the panic button - for use in dangerous situations such as armed robbery - and the police swarmed in almost immediately. Barclays says: \"We have clear guidelines in these cases and, unfortunately on this occasion, these were not followed. The branch was totally at fault in involving the police.\" The bank adds: \"We cannot apologise enough for the distress and trauma this whole matter has caused you.\" The bank also \"cannot apologise enough\" for the police search of your lodgings and it has contacted your university to explain your absence. Barclays initially translated these apologies into a \u00a31,000 offer. Capital Letters said this was not enough for your unwarranted nightmare. We consulted lawyers Christian Khan, who specialise in wrongful arrest claims. The law firm suggested looking at \"Thomson, Hsu and Commissioner of Metropolitan Police\", a 1997 landmark case which sets a \"tariff\" for wrongful detention cases. This suggests around \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 an hour, plus, if you take the case further, the possibility of exemplary damages of up to \u00a350,000. After Capital Letters intervened, Barclays increased its offer to \u00a34,000 - in line with the \"tariff\". This is a reasonable offer after a very unreasonable experience. You wish, not surprisingly, to put all this behind you and get on with your studies. So you will not be claiming for exemplary damages. Barclays has been less generous to your landlady. It has sent her a bouquet of flowers. The bank's police liaison department will also contact the local police in Northamptonshire to ensure you are exonerated in this matter, wiping out your bail conditions so you will not have to report to the police station in February. You should ensure any fingerprints or DNA tests taken during your incarceration are destroyed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
