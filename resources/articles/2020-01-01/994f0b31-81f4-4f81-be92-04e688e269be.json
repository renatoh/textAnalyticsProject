Ministers have been considering a merger of the FCO and DfID for months, but in recent weeks it was reported that the plans advocated by Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, had been put on hold. Fox, still influential in Conservative policy making, is to urge Johnson not to grant a last-minute reprieve to DfID in an attempt to buy political peace. In a speech to the Institute for Government on Tuesday he will argue \u201cthe Conservative victory has created a political moment which is as important as Mrs Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979\u201d, and as a result the reshaping of Whitehall must be as radical. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been pressing the case for a single merged department, but the resistance has come from DfID, which is concerned that the key poverty reduction goals of the aid budget will be blurred if its work is conducted inside a politically directed FCO. Raab confirmed in the Commons that ministers were preparing a root and branch foreign security and development review as part of the post-Brexit landscape. Fox will claim in his speech that the Foreign Office has seen \u201cdecades of degradation of the UK\u2019s overseas capability as the Treasury has taken advantage of Britain\u2019s Eurocentricity to penny pinch\u201d. He continues: \u201cUnsurprisingly, the selling of global property assets has had a cumulative diminution in Britain\u2019s standing abroad with no benefit, economically or politically at home. When we returned to office in 2010, having worked as a Foreign Office minister in John Major\u2019s government, I was horrified at how hollowed out the FCO had become. This process must be reversed.\u201d Fox will deny accusations that a reorganisation is a distraction, arguing it is central to ensuring the UK has a single coherent overseas policy. \u201cWith a new government elected, with a strong majority, in a Britain about to abandon some of the institutions to which it has been shackled for the last 40 years, this is no time to give undue weight to traditional self-interest.\u201d Fox will say DfID is \u201cundoubtedly regarded as a hugely successful global brand \u2013 just not a British one, despite the valiant efforts of recent secretaries of state\u201d. He will say: \u201cI was particularly struck at the last Commonwealth heads of government meeting in London where African leaders, in particular, were keen to talk to DfID officials rather than their Foreign Office counterparts. \u201cA country can have only one foreign policy, not two, and this is an opportunity to correct the problem without undermining our legal commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.\u201d Fox complains that the UK currently has more DfID staff in Kenya than his old Department for International Trade has in the whole of Africa. Fox will claim that those advising against reorganising Whitehall will be \u201cthe very same people who sought to thwart Brexit itself\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
