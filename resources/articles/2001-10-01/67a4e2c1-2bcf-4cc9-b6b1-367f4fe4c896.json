Senior and frontline social workers at the London borough told the Laming inquiry last week that no one was responsible for the management or supervision of Victoria's case because their system of assessment and referral was \"chaotic\". As a result it took nine weeks for a social worker to be allocated to the girl and her great-aunt Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kouao - later found guilty of her murder. During this time, staff also failed to carry out a home visit, check whether Victoria's childminder was registered, or find out why she was not in school. Nor did they document their concerns about the girl's injuries or pass them on to the neighbouring borough of Brent, where they placed her and Kouao in accommodation. Sarah Stollard, manager of Ealing's referral and assessment team, admitted Victoria's case was not considered a priority because they believed it was about housing and finance. The council's homeless persons unit had referred Kouao to them in April 1999 after her application for accommodation failed, Ms Stollard told the inquiry. \"She did not present with injuries, she did not present as a child that other agencies were concerned about,\" she said. \"It was an accommodation issue and a finance issue. We did not go looking for child protection issues.\" But, Judith Finlay, who was senior commissioning manager for social services at the time, acknowledged this assessment was inadequate. \"We failed to assess Victoria's individual circumstances and needs, and focused on the presenting problem, which was an issue of housing,\" Ms Finlay, now director of children's services, said on Thursday. Sharmain Lawrence, a senior practitioner at Ealing, added: \"There was no specific guidance around how we approached cases or referrals where the presenting issue was homelessness or destitution, and there was no particular assessment framework for approaching the case.\" There was a particular lack of guidance for dealing with people from abroad, despite the fact they made up 60-70% of the team's caseload, she said. The inquiry heard how the duty system in operation at Ealing social services meant staff were not responsible for following up and completing cases they were presented with on any given day. \"I actually found the system somewhat chaotic,\" said Ms Lawrence. \"No one of us were responsible for management or supervision of [Victoria's] case, because it was a case that was open to the duty system, so it would be managed if it came to our attention on the week that we were on duty.\" This confused arrangement was made worse by the team's heavy workload and staff shortages, she added. They had a backlog of 200 cases and at times 50% of the staff were agencies workers. \"I think it was impossible to allocate the number of cases that there were on the duty system,\" said Ms Lawrence. A few days after being referred to Ealing, Kouao and Victoria were placed in accommodation in Brent. However, Godfrey Victor, the social worker who made the placement, did not notify Brent council even though this was standard procedure. This breakdown in communication may have led to Brent never following up the call about Victoria's welfare made by Kouao's relative because the borough was unaware of where the pair were living, the inquiry heard. Ealing eventually allocated social worker Pamela Fortune to the case but decided a week later that Kouao would no longer be funded. The council offered to give her money to return to France and to look after Victoria until Kouao was more settled. Both of these offers were refused by Kouao and Ms Fortune told her the council was closing her case. A week later Kouao returned to the Ealing offices, on the same day Brent social services contacted its neighbouring borough concerning a call about Victoria's injuries that a consultant at Central Middlesex hospital regarded as non-accidental. Kouao told Ms Fortune the scars were caused by scabies. She then left Victoria alone for an hour in the office reception. Ms Fortune was asked to send details of their case to Brent social services but because a proper assessment had never been carried out she could only send a summary. This did not include concerns raised by other Ealing social workers - including Deborah Gaunt who thought the child looked like an advert for the charity Action Aid. Ms Gaunt, who saw Victoria and Kouao, said last Tuesday that the girl had an odd relationship with Kouao, which led her to question whether they were mother and daughter. But she made no written record of her concerns. Ealing's referral and assessment team was created during restructuring of Ealing social services after it received a damning report by the social services inspectorate in 1997, the inquiry heard. However, senior practitioners, managers and the department's solicitor failed to realise a full assessment had been undertaken on Victoria's case because they did not monitor casework Ms Finlay acknowledged there had been no arrangements in place to ensure staff had carried out assessments. She told the inquiry no one could say how many other cases were not properly assessed in that period \"because it has never been looked at\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
