The recommendation was unofficial and the commission is due to name a new election date today. The suggested delay conflicted with calls from the country's opposition leaders for the vote to go ahead on schedule on January 8. It was unclear how a decision to postpone the vote would be greeted in the southern province of Sindh, the heartland of Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP). The province was still volatile yesterday as it began to recover after three days of riots and clashes between PPP supporters and security forces in which more than 40 people were killed. The Karachi stock exchange, the country's biggest, opened for business for the first time since the assassination and suffered an immediate fall of nearly 5%. Polling stations, ballot boxes and ballot papers were destroyed in the unrest, and preparations for the election were set back. The European Union said a full election monitoring mission could no longer be fielded in time for next Tuesday. Such logistical problems were behind the commission's recommendation for a delay. Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), insisted the vote go ahead on time. He also called for Pervez Musharraf, the president, to stand down to make way for a national unity government. \"He is a one man calamity,\" Sharif said. \"The United States should see that Musharraf has not limited or curbed terrorism. In fact terrorism is now stronger than ever before with more sinister aspects.\" Siddiqul Farooq, a spokesman for Sharif, said that if there were to be a delay, it would have to be \"very short\" and the PML-N would seek to form a common front with the PPP and other parties to keep pressure on Musharraf to stick to his commitment to restore democracy after eight years of military rule. \"If there is rigging in the general elections, the parties will join hands to form a movement to get rid of this government,\" Farooq said. The movement would use peaceful means including strikes and protests to \"paralyse the entire government machinery\". Sharif called for a boycott of the elections in the immediate aftermath of Thursday's assassination, but Farooq said his leader had changed his mind out of respect for Bhutto's political will. The testament was made public on Sunday and called for elections to go ahead. Bhutto's 19-year-old son Bilawal was made PPP chairman after her death, with his father, Asif Ali Zardari, acting as caretaker while the young heir continues his university studies. Zardari had called on Sunday for elections to be held on time despite his wife's assassination, but was non-committal yesterday in response to reports of the election commission's recommended delay, saying he would have to consult his party once a new date had been announced. The US and Britain, who persuaded Bhutto to return to Pakistan last year to take part in elections, have both been pressing for the Musharraf government to stick to its timetable for a return to democracy. But US and British officials said they would back a delay for logistical reasons, if it was as short as possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
