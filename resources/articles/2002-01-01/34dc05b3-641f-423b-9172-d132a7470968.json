Keira Morgan Williams, whose father Hugh is chairman of the North-East in Europe pressure group, bought a tube of Smarties with euros at the WH Smith's outlet at Newcastle airport today. The child from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, used coins flown in specially by the pro-European MP, Kevan Jones, Labour member for Durham North. Mr Jones took an early flight from Newcastle to Amsterdam's Schipol airport early in the morning and returned at around 10am with notes and coins. At Heathrow, airport travellers on their way to New Year breaks on the continent were getting to grips with the new notes as currencies were phased out across 12 European countries. Bureaux de change reported brisk business in euros early today as Europe woke up to the new currency. Debbie Moorhouse, manager of Travelex at Heathrow Terminal One, said all travellers heading for European destinations adopting the euro had opted to buy the new currency. \"It's a fairly quiet day of the year for us, but we've done quite a bit of business so far in the euro,\" she said. \"You can still get the old currencies for a short while if you want them, but we are advising customers to take out euros as they will get their change in euros if they pay in the previous currency.\" Passengers checking in for European flights broadly welcomed the new currency saying it would make future transactions simpler once they were used to its value."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
