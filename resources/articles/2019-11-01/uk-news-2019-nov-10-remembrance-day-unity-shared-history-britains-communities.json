Called \u201cremember together\u201d and coordinated by the Royal British Legion and thinktank British Future, it encourages people from different backgrounds to commemorate their shared history 75 years after major battles such as D-Day. The initiative comes as Labour and the Conservatives use Sunday to launch competing pledges to help veterans. Jeremy Corbyn announced that Labour\u2019s manifesto, to be released later this month, will include \u201ca new social contract\u201d for former armed forces personnel, including reserved homes for rough sleepers alongside free education and training. The Conservatives unveiled plans for veterans to get a third off the cost of train travel under a majority Tory government. Under its pledge, the party believes that 700,000 veterans not covered by existing railcards will benefit. The promises came as dignitaries joined servicemen and women on Saturday night at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall to honour Britain\u2019s war dead during the Royal British Legion\u2019s annual festival of remembrance. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen and other members of the royal family for the event. Senior royals will also attend Sunday\u2019s remembrance service at the Cenotaph in central London. They will, it is hoped, be joined by blind veteran John Robinson, 53, from North Wales, who has vowed to battle through health difficulties for a third successive year to be present. The former Parachute Regiment corporal attended the 2017 commemorations two weeks after suffering a heart attack and was rushed to hospital immediately after last year\u2019s ceremony when he needed an operation on his pancreas. The \u201cremember together\u201d campaign celebrates servicemen and women from allied nations such as Poland and the Czech Republic who fought for Britain in the second world war, alongside millions from pre-partition India, including modern-day Pakistan and Bangladesh, and the Caribbean, Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In a joint letter, Labour\u2019s David Lammy, Conservative MP Neil O\u2019Brien and Lib Dem defence spokesperson Jamie Stone urged the public to remember \u201chow soldiers from Britain and its allies from across the Commonwealth nations, the US and the free armies of Europe fought side by side to overcome adversity,\u201d and to \u201creflect on the things that we share\u201d. They are joined by former chief of defence staff Lord Richards of Herstmonceux along with senior representatives of the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths and from Britain\u2019s Sikh and Hindu communities, Polish veterans and Pakistan\u2019s High Commission to the UK. The Royal British Legion\u2019s Catherine Davies said: \u201cToday\u2019s Britain is made up of so many communities whose ancestors stood together in our darkest hour. Remembering the service and sacrifice of all of these communities is vital to understanding our shared remembrance heritage.\u201d Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s tradition of remembrance is as relevant if your parents came here from India, Pakistan or Poland as it is for someone whose family has lived here for generations. It\u2019s something we share that can bring us together.\u201d In a statement released at midnight Corbyn pledged to \u201cguarantee justice for veterans\u201d and referred to figures claiming that more than 60,000 veterans have been let down by the Tories. Among other initiatives in his party\u2019s manifesto include new career opportunities through increased apprenticeship places and ensuring that every surviving veteran that suffered from exposure to unsafe levels of radiation during nuclear tests from the 1950s onwards receives compensation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
