You read about the person you're going to meet, and form some advance impressions \u2013 but everything still rests on those first few minutes in each other's company, when you find out if you're going to connect. If this interview really had been a date, I think I might have made my excuses and slipped away quite quickly. Gary Lineker is every bit as handsome as you'd expect \u2013 and friendly, in a polite sort of way, with a smooth and winning smile. But you'd be tempted to suspect that he'd been put up to the meeting by a mate, for beneath the smile he wears the unmistakable expression of someone who is only here on sufferance, willing to do whatever necessary to meet his obligations, but no more than that. It's a bit disappointing, obviously \u2013 but probably not so surprising, for you don't get to have a career like Lineker's if you cannot keep your mouth shut. And his is an incredible career \u2013 or, rather, pair of careers \u2013 for to be a world-class footballer, and captain of your national team, would be an extraordinary achievement in itself. But then to transfer from the pitch to the TV studio, to anchor Match of the Day, and become one of the country's favourite sports broadcasters, is practically freakish. At 50, he is not just a household name, but a national treasure. I don't think I have ever heard anyone say a bad word about Lineker, and even his adverts for Walkers crisps have a charm that falls just the right side of cheesy. Lineker has been the face of Walkers for 16 years, and he's now promoting their stunt for Comic Relief, in which four comedians compete to sell specially flavoured crisps (Jimmy Carr is flogging Jimmy con Carne flavoured ones, Al Murray's are Steak and Al Pie, and so on). So we meet at a PR company's office, surrounded by reams of press releases that say things such as: \"Walkers loves having a laugh and Red Nose Day is a great way to have fun,\" none of which strikes me as massively interesting. I'm more interested in Lineker's views on themes in contemporary football \u2013 but alas, these turn out to be as carefully sanitised as an FA press release. The game, he says, hasn't been spoilt by money, nor is wealth the motivation for aspiring youngsters today. \"You've got no chance of reaching the top if you're just playing for money. No, you play because you love it \u2013 and if you've got a talent you'll love it even more. You're not telling me that five-year-olds go: 'If I do this I'll earn lots of money and have a great life.' I don't think they watch their idols play and go, 'Ooh, he's on 150 grand a week'.\" He's not jealous of the earning power of today's players, but thinks if he'd been paid their sort of wages, \"I would have handled it all right. I was always relatively level-headed.\" The suggestion that today's national team is too pampered by riches to bother really trying for their country is also wide of the mark, he says. \"You cannot reach the top unless you're truly motivated and passionate about the game, and care about your performance and care about your team's performance.\" Equally inaccurate, he says, is the impression of premiership footballers as vice-ridden bad boys. \"Most young footballers are a cross-section of working-class society, and so as in any life you're going to get some people that drink too much, or take drugs, or like the girls. So you read about these things, and can dangerously make the assumption that all footballers live like that, and it's not true. By and large, most of them will probably try to live a reasonable life and be professional. But that doesn't make great copy. You're not going to get a front page News of the World headline: 'Footballer has night in with wife.'\" And on it goes, this masterclass in vanilla diplomacy. I ask about the Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson's long-standing boycott of Match of the Day, and Lineker says mildly: \"He's got his reasons, and he's within his rights. If he doesn't want to speak, he doesn't have to speak, he's under no obligation.\" Reflecting on managers in general, he offers: \"Different managers have different skills and probably the most important thing is bringing the best out of the players you've got, and getting the best out of whatever budget is available to you. I think those are the two key things.\" Losing the will to live, I have a last stab: where does he stand in the debate over whether England should have an English manager? \"I'm not really that fussed. I want England to have a really good manager.\" Oh-kaaay. A little bit of me wonders whether Lineker might not really be that fussed about discussing football with a woman, but I think that would probably be paranoia. It is interesting, though, that on one of the rare occasions when he ventures what could almost be described as bold opinion, it's to express sympathy for the two Sky sports presenters who lost their jobs in a sexism row. \"Obviously I don't know what's gone on there,\" he begins cautiously. \"They're both very good broadcasters, no question about that. I guess it was the manner of how it happened, rather than possibly the content, that was the problem. If it had been the old jokey, 'Oh women don't know the offside rule, blah blah, have a laugh about it', I think it would probably have gone unnoticed. But it came over as if they really meant it rather than were joking. Whether that was true or not, I don't know. And it went on from there. But I don't know why the thing played so big.\" It sounds, I suggest, as if he thinks what happened to the Sky presenters was unfair. A faintly uneasy pause, as Lineker considers his response. \"Well,\" he finally says, \"I think any broadcaster would say, 'There but for the grace of God.' Which is why you can't be holier than thou. I totally disagree with what they said, of course,\" he adds. \"But off air, every single one of us would have said something that would probably get us the sack. Cos we all do it. I'm sure you'd be the same. It made me think, my God, you've got to be so careful now. So that's the side of it where I'm going, God, is this the way it should be?'\" Did the Sky presenters' fate feel a bit Big Brotherish to him? \"Yeah, very much so.\" But then, of course, he balances this by saying he hopes that any sexist \u2013 or in his words \"blokey\" \u2013 culture in professional football will one day be offset by the arrival of a female player alongside the men. \"If a genius is born, why not? There's no reason why at some point some superstar woman can't emerge, who could possibly play. Why can't a strong and quick woman come along? It's not impossible. It would be great, it would be brilliant for the game if it happened, a great boost for football. It would be a great story.\" It isn't hard to see how Lineker managed to receive not a single yellow throughout his entire football career. It's an astonishing record \u2013 virtually unequalled in the modern game \u2013 and indicative of almost superhuman professional self-control, in a career distinguished by an absence of failure. Signed to Leicester FC as a schoolboy in the late 70s, the striker transferred to league champions Everton in 1985, to become the first division's highest scorer. The highest scoring player in the 1986 World Cup finals, he signed for Barcelona, followed by Tottenham Hotspur, and finally a Japanese side, where an injury brought his career to an end in 1994. He turned his hand to broadcasting, and has been presenting Match of the Day since 1999. In fact, the only loss of self-control occurred at the 1990 World Cup finals, during England's match against the Republic of Ireland, when Lineker had a \"dodgy stomach\" and lost control of his bowels during a tackle. Footage shows him dragging himself along the grass, not unlike a dog, and hastily wiping his hands before playing on \u2013 yet he managed to keep the incident quiet for 20 years, only admitting to it in an interview last November. I get the feeling he's far from bland in private, but is formidably careful when it comes to his public image. He always looks immaculately groomed, and suspiciously bronzed, but Lineker swears the tan is natural. On Saturdays he arrives at the TV studios by noon, watches all the games, and writes his own script before broadcasting live. In the early days, he used to watch every show with his editors \u2013 \"I told them to be brutal with me, I just really wanted to learn\" \u2013 and hired a voice coach \"to get some enthusiasm and light and shade into my voice\", which, off air, still sounds resoundingly flat. He is so disciplined that I don't for a minute imagine that he'll say yes when I ask if he ever has a drink before going on air late on Saturday night. And, of course, he says no. But occasionally his regular studio guest Alan Hansen looks as if he might have had one or two, which is what I'm really getting at \u2013 but when I ask Lineker he just laughs and says: \"No, that's been said to me before, but no, that's not right. With Alan, it might just be nerves.\" Nerves? Hansen? How unlikely. \"No, he's always uptight before the show,\" Lineker chuckles happily, in that way sportsmen do when teasing each other. \"He has this shuffly foot thing on the floor before his first question, before he speaks. He says that as a player before every game he ever played he either felt sick or was sick.\" Was Lineker ever nervous before a game? \"No, not really, I never got nervous.\" If nothing else, he must surely have worried towards the end of his playing career about getting booked and spoiling his clean sheet? \"No, I never even thought about it. I never really realised [I had a clean sheet] until very near to the end. Truthfully, I never thought about it once during a match. I was only interested in scoring goals. I wasn't interested in anything else.\" He wasn't even that interested, he admits, in the sport. From his early 20s he knew he wanted to go into TV journalism after retirement, being nowhere near obsessed enough with football to even think about becoming a manager. \"I never was, to be honest. I never really liked training that much, and the thought of watching other people train . . .\" He shudders and laughs. \"I just think to be a manager you've got to live and breathe and have this incredible enthusiasm for football, the whole thing. And while I love the game, and it's been a large part of my life, it's not the only thing in my life. I wouldn't want to go out six nights a week and watch somebody's reserves playing to check out a footballer to see if we're going to buy him. I have a much better life this way.\" In fact, he hasn't played a game of football since the day he retired. \"I never really enjoyed playing friendly matches or warm-up matches and stuff like that. So without the buzz of the big game, what buzz am I going to get from playing? And I just don't fancy being rubbish. I mean, you've got to play regularly to avoid being useless, and what's the point in being useless?\" Instead he took up golf, and says he's useless at that, but that's not really true for he has a handicap of five. Does he actively avoid trying anything unless he thinks he'll be good at it? \"Oh yeah, for example, entertainment television. I've had lots of offers but I'm just not that kind of presenter. I don't think I can be false in terms of being larger than life; when I present Sport Relief, I'm always a little bit out of my comfort zone, cos I feel like I've got to be a little bit showbiz, and I feel uncomfortable with myself, I don't feel like I'm me. I like what I do, and I don't think there's any need to be greedy.\" He did appear in a documentary about step-families last year, alongside his second wife, Danielle, an underwear model he married in 2009, who is now stepmother to his four teenage sons. Lineker's first marriage lasted 20 years, without attracting the sort of publicity common to Wag culture nowadays \u2013 and again, he says, this was no accident. \"Well, I've never sold my private life and I'd be uncomfortable to do that. I don't think it's good to sell your new baby or sell your wedding, personally. Other people might think differently and fair enough, they're entitled to that. But I think it's about finding a balance. I don't mind giving up a bit of my life, I understand how it works, and I think you learn as you go along that it's quite good to give a little bit of yourself. \"When you're a player, you have to be terribly guarded cos anything you say can be taken out of context, so you're very careful and very dull and make sure your answers are pretty bland. Whereas after football, if you want to go into the media, you've got to try and make yourself a little bit more interesting.\" And somehow, Lineker has managed to do just that, making himself irresistibly appealing without ever taking a risk. When we go outside for the photo shoot, literally every passing car slows down to stare and smile and wave. Strangers have been waving at him for almost all of his life \u2013 and I wonder whether he would have missed that had he disappeared from public life when his playing career came to an end. \"Quite possibly, yeah,\" he agrees. \"It just becomes so normal to me, it's how my life is and people are unbelievably kind, almost across the board. People are just really pleasant, so why wouldn't you enjoy that and embrace it?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
