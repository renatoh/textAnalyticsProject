In two days I read over 30 comments in emails to me and letters to the editor as well as hundreds of comments posted on a blog written by Emily Bell, the Guardian's director of digital content. Users' concerns were neatly summarised by someone who asked three questions in a posting on the blog: \"(a) Why were people originally consulted on the redesign if their views weren't taken on board (or were they)? (b) What was it about the old site that needed 'fixing'? (c) What is it that has improved about the new site?\" The website launched the new homepage, rather sneakily, in the wee small hours of Thursday morning. Reading the first comments was like listening to someone pull petals from a daisy - you loved it, you loved it not. Most didn't love it: too busy; too many ads; doesn't work well with older hardware and smaller screens; star writers were not flagged; don't like the font; menus should have stayed on the left; too generic. Bring back the old page. People who had bookmarked the Guardian site felt ambushed by the change. One disgruntled user said: \"It's like waking up to find that your spouse has redecorated the house during the night - with the best that flatpack can provide.\" The redesign of the homepage is the second in a series of rolling launches that will take place over the next 18 months. It is part of a major rebuild and redesign of the entire Guardian site. Changes to the underlying structure were made last year - that part of the project culminated in the launch of a new Travel site at the end of November. This was styled, as some of you will know, like the redesigned front page. The redesign is partly about making the site more accessible and easier to navigate. Last week some people struggled to locate favourite content and the website posted FAQs on the blog to help users find their bearings. User experience in the first few days may not be the most reliable indication of whether the new homepage is more or less easy to navigate. Emily Bell pointed out in a posting on her own blog that, according to our research, the old site was actually more difficult to navigate - but users who accessed it from the front page (and many didn't) had got used to it. One user was sanguine about the possibility that familiarity might breed contentment: \"Hate it at present, will love it in a week, no doubt, and will have completely forgotten what the old layout looked like in a month (or considerably less).\" The old site lacked the tools and flexibility our web developers need to change ways of hosting and accessing different types of content. We could not for example play videos off the page, nor could we accept ads in new formats and sizes. The redesign will enable the site to do these things and much more. Emily Bell has made it clear that there is no going back - but she is listening to the feedback from users. Comments posted to her blog are being reviewed and sorted into \"silos of concern\" to be considered by editors, web developers and designers. She said in a posting on her blog: \"If the design fails to attract and engage users it will change pretty quickly.\" There are no signs of this at present. These discussions about the new homepage indicate two distinct sets of users. There are those who expect the website to behave and feel like the newspaper - represented by this comment: \"I hate the new front page. It looks like a blog rather than a newspaper and lacks the authority of the previous design which at least resembled the print edition\". Others view print and online Guardian products as mutually exclusive, at least in terms of presentation - represented by this posting: \"I personally loved the new site. It's adapting itself to the new things that the web has to offer, because that's what the Guardian does. It is a leader not a follower.\" It may not be possible to please everybody. reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
