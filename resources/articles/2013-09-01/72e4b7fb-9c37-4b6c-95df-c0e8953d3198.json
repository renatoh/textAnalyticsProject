Galileo Rock has looked an obvious contender for Doncaster since his third-place finish, just behind one of today's opponents Libertarian, in the Derby at Epsom in June. Wachman seems to be looking for a reason not to run, however, and, even if Galileo does take part, he will need to be at his best to win, which is far from certain with more rain forecast for Town Moor overnight. Excess Knowledge seems likely to start favourite whether Galileo Rock runs or not but his price looks to owe more to his trainer's outstanding record at this stage of the season and in this race in particular than it does to his chance on the book. The fact that Cap O'Rushes, who beat him last time out, can be backed at 18-1 while Excess Knowledge is 7-2 is bizarre, for all that he looked a little unfortunate to lose at Goodwood. Libertarian also put up an outstanding trial for this race in the Derby, and for that matter in the Dante Stakes at York too, but needs to be forgiven a dismal run in Ireland last time out. This looks like a daunting task for the Oaks winner Talent, who would be the first filly to win for 21 years, while Leading Light has not been out since winning the two-mile Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot, a race which is generally one of the weakest Group Three contests of the season. His stablemate Foundry (3.50), however, makes plenty of appeal. Ryan Moore, who won the Derby on Aidan O'Brien's Ruler Of The World, takes the ride on the son of Galileo, who ran Telescope to a length-and-a-quarter in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last time. That was Foundry's first run since winning a Leopardstown maiden on his racecourse debut in November last year and time may show that getting as close as he did to Telescope over his optimum trip of 12 furlongs was an exceptional performance first time up. He has stamina on both sides of his pedigree and is open to any amount of improvement, though he might not need to find too much to win what is, by the standards of some recent renewals, a competitive Leger but not, perhaps, a high-class one. Other Channel 4 TV races Doncaster 2.05 A fascinating contest which pulls together form lines from the big festival meetings at Newmarket, Goodwood and York, and also from Ireland too, as Ger Lyons's Exogenesis was third behind War Command in a Group Two last time out. Success for Charlie Appleby's Outstrip would be a further boost for the form of Richard Hannon's Toormore, who beat him by a neck in the Vintage Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, but Anjaal is preferred. The style of his success in the six-furlong July Stakes suggested that today's seven will suit him ideally. Chester 2.20 Mehdi has been making steady progress since joining David Nicholls at the start of the season and his run at Ripon last time was another step forward. Assuming Adrian Nicholls can get him out quickly and make the most of his rail draw, a repeat of that could be enough off today's mark of 88. Doncaster 2.40 The Portland Handicap offers its usual challenge, to find a winner from a big field of tough, experienced sprint handicappers when there may well be little more than two or three lengths between the first 10 home. There are all manner of possibilities but backers of Roger Varian's Steps can at least be sure that their horse is fit, fairly weighted and prepared by a trainer who could not be in better form. Chester 2.55 Tac De Boistron has been stabled in France and Australia at various points in his career \u2013 he was in the field for the Melbourne Cup last November \u2013 and made a promising start for Marco Botti, his latest trainer, at Goodwood last month. He may struggle against the lightly raced Cubanita, though. Ralph Beckett's four-year-old is making only her ninth start but has come good in the autumn in each of the last two seasons and was a good third in a better race last time out. Doncaster 3.15 The Prix Jacques le Marois proved to be a step too far for Aljamaheer last time out but he ran well enough behind Moonlight Cloud, Olympic Glory and Intello to suggest that he remains in the sort of form which took him into second place in the Group One Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. He is back in Group Two company on Saturday and may also benefit from the drop to seven furlongs.
