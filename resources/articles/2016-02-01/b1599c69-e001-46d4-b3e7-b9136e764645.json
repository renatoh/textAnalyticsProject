He is an amenable athlete, one who is already exploring the fruits of his labours, but maybe one too accommodating for his own good. Prince Charles, as he styles himself, is an unbeaten 6ft 5in southpaw who holds the IBF\u2019s heavyweight belt, which he displayed proudly in London on Friday for the benefit of the media and his upcoming antagonist, Anthony Joshua. While the Londoner is determined to send the champion home to California with just his bling and a cheque rumoured to be around $3.5m to ease his pain, Martin, naturally, sees the assignment differently. \u201cMy first time here, a great experience,\u201d he said of London. But the \u201cPrince\u201d title is not for the heir to the throne, he says. \u201cIt is something that is memorable, so when I make these big impressions on boxing I got a name that goes with it.\u201d On the evidence of his win over the Ukrainian Vyacheslav Glazkov on an injury retirement in the third round when they met in Brooklyn last month for the title the International Boxing Federation stripped from Tyson Fury, Martin is either a pie-eyed optimist or a most generous champion to risk his title against Joshua. \u201cThey threw some names at me: Dominic Breazeale, Chris Arreola \u2013 but I don\u2019t want one-sided fights. I\u2019m a little bit different. I always take risks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had to agree with me because I\u2019m the boss. I want Anthony Joshua\u2019s fans, on his playing field. Winning this fight will change my life. Money has nothing to do with it. It will turn me into a superstar. I want people to know me like they know [Floyd] Mayweather. Everything is calculated.\u201d They meet at the O2 Arena in London on 9 April, the first world heavyweight title fight in the capital in 16 years and a most curious affair. When the fight community gathered at the Dorchester on Park Lane to inspect the American and his credentials, a room full of cynics could not remember a time when a world heavyweight champion chose to risk his title at the first time of asking against a non-mandatory contender with 15 stoppage wins in as many fights. While it makes little fistic sense, Eddie Hearn says he could have sold out Wembley Stadium many times over \u2013 although maybe not at the tailend of winter. Martin brings a familiar CV. \u201cI was in construction out in Phoenix, Arizona, double shifts. I know about hard work, adversity, all the ups and downs. I didn\u2019t want to be that smart guy stacking groceries for the rest of his life.\u201d Taken to the gym by his mother\u2019s brothers, he also describes himself as \u201ca natural\u201d in the ring, although the available evidence is scant. Martin, a born port-sider, boxes with his left fist poised like a hammer, throws it hard and enthusiastically but with little discretion, and turns square in the delivery, head held high, which will expose him to fierce counters if Joshua\u2019s trainer, Tony Sims, has done his homework. All that will unfold on the night; meanwhile, there should be a minimum of trash talk in the coming weeks. Born in Missouri 29 years ago, Martin took up boxing in his late teens, a later starter than even Joshua who is three years younger. So both are relatively callow \u2013 and fresh, with considerable power in both their fists. Martin turned pro after losing in the final of the 2012 Golden Gloves; Joshua turned over after winning Olympic gold. Martin\u2019s camp manager and travelling companion here is Paul Cain, who has not lost his Scouse accent during 30 years across the Atlantic. A caterer and chef, he got into boxing when the TV producer Mike King asked him provide the food on the Wheel Of Fortune programme. \u201cMike had a gym looking for American heavyweights,\u201d he says. \u201cCharles was a kid we found, he\u2019d never put a glove on, 208 pounds. So 65 amateur fights, 24 pro later, been with him the whole time and he\u2019s a world champion. I first met him seven years ago. He came into The Rock in Carson. He was a talent right away. Lived in America 30 years and come back as much as I can.\u201d One way or another, he will not forget his visit in April. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 February 2016. It was Eddie, not Barry, Hearn who said he could have sold out Wembley Stadium many times over; and Anthony Joshua has had 15 stoppage wins in as many fights to date, not 16."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
