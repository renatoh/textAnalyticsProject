A week of talks between football bodies and the players\u2019 union, the PFA, has led to little movement before an extraordinary Premier League shareholders meeting on Friday. Away from negotiations, debate has centred on the tone-deafness of some clubs seeking tax payers\u2019 money to furlough non-playing staff. According to one expert, however, it is also possible that substantial wage bills could hinder the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back after the crisis, leaving leading players as easy pickings for rival leagues. \u201cThey have to agree player wage reductions; that has to occur,\u201d said James Barford of Enders Analysis, author of a recent report into the effects of Covid-19 on the football industry. \u201cBut if the agreed temporary wage reductions are not adequate, there could be problems.\u201d This week Barcelona players announced they were taking a temporary 70% cut in their pay. According to Lionel Messi the decision was made in order to \u201cfind a formula to support the club\u201d. Players at Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have made similar efforts, and Juventus\u2019s first team have agreed to freeze their pay. As the Premier League\u2019s rivals have taken action, English clubs continue to pay out wages that in several cases \u2013 according to the most recent accounts \u2013 equate to 75% of revenue, most of which has suddenly come to a halt. \u201cIf the reductions aren\u2019t sufficient but they are in other big football clubs and other big leagues in the world, then the only other option to avert bankruptcy for many Premier League clubs will be to sell their players,\u201d Barford said. \u201cThey could be forced even to sell them at cut prices, perhaps to the Chinese Super League or to rivals in Europe that have got their act together.\u201d The PFA is believed to have resisted direct calls from the Premier League to consider wage cuts, preferring an arrangement which would defer wages. The union is thought to be sceptical that savings from cuts won\u2019t be used to finance clubs\u2019 future dealings in the transfer market. Pressure is set to come to a head at Friday\u2019s shareholder\u2019s meeting, but if a solution can be found, Barford believes the Premier League can expect to return with a decent bill of health. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back,\u201d he said, \u201cprovided the players are there and clubs are still solvent. People still want to see football and they are missing it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
