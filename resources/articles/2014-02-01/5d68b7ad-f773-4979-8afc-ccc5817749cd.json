The Boston psych-folk trio's music is redolent of those things \u2013 this is an album that defies you to believe it was made in a Brooklyn studio. Their patchwork sound is comprised of languid pastoral harmonies (especially lissome on Eye of the Pearl), Incredible String Band-like patchouli-drone (check The World is Flat, which flicks from lulling psychedelia to hotel-lounge jazz halfway through) and lysergic reverb that hints that Tame Impala may have been an inspiration (I Sleep in Nature). Throughout, the trio sing trippily of water, sky and animals, both real and metaphorical: \"And now I'm seasoned as a swan,\" they croon in three-part harmony on Secondary Swan, which, like all their lyrics, lends itself to mind-bending interpretations. It's all lovely, if a bit aimless \u2013 the most distinctive element is Anna Fox Rochinski's breathy soprano voice, which should be more of a feature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
