Before making up his mind to attack Iraq and Saddam Hussein, he should remember the Suez crisis in 1956 and Anthony Eden's ill-fated attempt to impose his will on Egypt's President Nasser. The similarities are striking. Today, as in 1956, a British prime minister is calling the nation to war. Tony Blair, like Eden after Nasser had seized control of the Suez canal, emphasises the danger of inaction, of allowing an untrustworthy dictator to threaten the West and the rule of international law. There was no doubt that Nasser was a dictator - but in a different mould from the European dictators of the 1930s. That was when Eden's character as a statesman had been shaped. Twenty years later he looked at the Middle East as though it were an extension of that earlier background, ignoring the quite different forces at work there. When Eden, in an intemperate broadcast, compared Nasser to Hitler, the editor of the Manchester Guardian - as it still was - asked me as his Middle East correspondent to tell our readers how the comparison looked from Cairo. I wrote that Nasser was \"a nationalist leader, an opportunist, whose objectives of strengthening the Arab world and establishing its full inde pendence . . . are painful to us, but arouse the natural enthusiasm of his own people\". Saddam Hussein too is a dictator, a less able but a far more dangerous one than Nasser. Surely any means must be justified to restrain so palpable a menace to society at large? Acting on this reasoning, the British government has dispatched a naval force and thousands of troops to the eastern Mediterranean in readiness to join the huge American land, sea and air forces assembling in the Middle East. In the same way 47 years ago, Anthony Eden's cabinet authorised the dispatch of substantial forces to Cyprus, from which they were to join the Royal Navy and the RAF in a combined attack on Egyptian defences around the Suez canal. It is worth noting that today, as in 1956, these preparations have been undertaken at the express instance of the prime minister. There are indications today, as there were in 1956, that the cabinet is less than wholly united on the objective in view, or on the means of achieving it. More significant is the fact that the British public is deeply divided, as it was during the Suez crisis. Then, as now, the opposition to the government's strategy included senior members of the armed forces, clerics, academics and businessmen, as well as politicians of all parties and many of their constituents. To encourage this growing opposition, I warned in 1956 that \"any military action against Egypt would lead to varying degrees of unrest in neighbouring Arab states, with attacks on Western-owned commercial and oil installations a certainty . . . and revolutions in Jordan and Iraq a distinct possibility\". Substitute Iraq for Egypt and Saudi Arabia for Iraq and the prospect looks discouragingly similar. Then there is the question of legality. Eden, when he flew off the handle on hearing of Nasser's takeover at Suez, jumped to the conclusion that the Egyptian must be in default of some clearly established treaty obligation. This led to long and involved researches into the status of a document known as the Constantinople convention, which had been drawn up in 1888 when Egypt was still nominally a province of the old Ottoman empire and whose conclusions were far from clear. When I went to see the legal adviser at the British embassy, he told me with exasperation that the convention was so badly drafted that it contained two clauses which contradicted each other. One stipulated that the canal must be kept open under all circumstances to the ships of all nations. The other gave the ruler of Egypt the right to close the canal if there should be a threat to the security of the country. And it was difficult to deny that Eden's fulminations against Nasser did constitute such a threat. So the case for an assault on Egypt in 1956 collapsed. Can we be sure that the case for an attack on Saddam's Iraq is any more sound? The security council's resolution 1441 is clearer in its terms than the Constantinople convention was, but it is debatable whether it authorises military intervention without further discussion. And what about the \"special relationship\" and of our obligations to the Americans and theirs to us? In 1956 President Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles, the US secretary of state, were our closest friends and allies all through the months of manoeuvring that preceded Britain's invasion of Egypt. But when the moment of decision came the Americans opted out, and for the best of reasons. They realised that to attack Egypt would cause needless bloodshed and recriminations, and would provoke turmoil all over the Middle East and beyond. In 1956 it was the Americans who saw the red light and stopped in time, while the British were driven on by a reckless leader - to disaster. Is it too late to hope that this time it may be the other way round?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
