But \u00d3scar and Valeria never made it, and now the graphic image of the father and daughter lying drowned in shallow water on the banks of the Rio Grande has given new urgency to the debate over the migrant crisis. At home in San Mart\u00edn, \u00d3scar\u2019s mother Rosa tells Anna-Catherine Brigida: \u201cI feel a huge emptiness.\u201d Treacherous waters.

The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and a former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, are vying for the leadership of the Conservative party, a contest whose victor will end up in 10 Downing Street. Odds on? Johnson said this week the UK must leave the EU in October \u201ccome what may, do or die\u201d, refusing to rule out no deal. But a day later, the flexible frontrunner insisted the odds of a no-deal Brexit remained a \u201cmillion-to-one against\u201d.

According to federal government data, clean energy such as solar and wind produced 23% of US electricity, compared with coal\u2019s 20%. Wealthy countries including the UK and Australia are within reach of eliminating cervical cancer, thanks to widespread take-up of the HPV vaccine, a major study has found. The Dutch national railway will attempt to atone for its part in the Holocaust by paying up to \u20ac50m to the relatives of those it transported to Nazi death camps during the second world war. A fossilised thigh bone recently unearthed in a Crimean cave suggests when humans first arrived in Europe from Africa, they may have shared the continent with a species of giant flightless bird that dwarfed ostriches and weighed close to half a tonne.

Just like in Europe, harsher policy doesn\u2019t stop people from trying to come, it merely forces them to take more risks.
