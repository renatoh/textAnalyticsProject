Another dismal defeat to Munster, who became the first team this season to qualify for April's quarter-finals after claiming a bonus point, left the Stockport-based club out of the tournament and facing a period of uncertainty with a number of players following the Frenchman out of the gates. Munster have struggled for consistency this season, but they scored two tries in the opening 13 minutes tonight and ran in six in total. They spent the final 20 minutes toying with Sale, who had briefly threatened a revival after falling 13 points behind within a minute into the second period, only for Charlie Hodgson, often so fallible on the big occasion, to give away a soft try. The opening try after just four minutes had also been given away cheaply, Luke McAlister and Richard Wigglesworth watching the ball bounce near their line rather than diving on it, and while the Sale captain Juan Fernandez Lobbe afterwards denied that his team bore any scars from the mauling here three years ago, their big players froze and their ploy of holding back the likes of Andrew Sheridan until the second half backfired. Where Munster blew Sale away at forward three years ago, now they outplayed them behind, performing with a width and pace that left a side with pretensions of winning the Guinness Premiership struggling to keep up. Sale's attack lacked variety, but their defence was pitifully thin and Munster's first four tries were given away as much as they were created. The third, 20 seconds after the restart, was a case in point. Donnacha O'Callaghan stole the kick-off and David Wallace squirmed out of one tackle and through two others to score under the posts. Munster's captain, Paul O'Connell, who opened the scoring, put in a commanding performance that enhanced his claim for the Lions captaincy. His return to full fitness has coincided with Munster finding their best form of the season, but he was not getting carried away after yet another bonus point victory over English opposition in Europe. \"This was all about filling the jersey, but we still have a way to go,\" he said. \"A lot was talked about the impact the crowd have at Thomond Park, but the players are the ones who have to front up on the pitch, not the spectators, and we did that tonight. We may have made the quarter-finals, but we want a home draw and that means winning in Montauban next week.\" Sale were given first use of the breeze but trailed 12-6 at the interval. O'Connell's try was followed by one from the hooker Jerry Flannery who was then sent to the sin-bin for tripping. Wallace's try prompted a brief revival from Sale, but Hodgson then wasted his own try by dropping a Ronan O'Gara kick near his own line to present Ian Dowling with a try. Scores by Tomas O'Leary and Paul Warwick confirmed Munster's superiority and Sale find themselves on the brink as the Saint-Andr\u00e9 era nears its end.
