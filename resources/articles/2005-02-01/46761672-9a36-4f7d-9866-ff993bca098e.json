Go on the Grey Mist boat which takes you really close to the falls. Also, see the falls all lit up at night. Cathy Kingsbury \u00b7 Yes, Niagara Falls is over-comercialised and you will be hard pressed to find a decent meal in the main thoroughfare, but it is still worth a visit. I lived in Canada for years and the falls themselves never failed to impress the many friends we brought to the area. The town is full of T-shirt shops, fast food joints and amusement fairs. Unless this appeals or you want to try your luck at the casinos, three days is definitely too long. The falls are under two hours from Toronto and can be seen on a day trip. Alternatively you could stay a night or two. That would give you an opportunity to see the falls lit up at night time, catch an IMAX film and enjoy some of the attractions by the Niagara River - which include a Buddha Temple, Butterfly Conservatory, and the Botanical gardens. And don't miss out on Niagara-on-the-Lake, a picturesque town about a half-hour drive from the Falls via a route through wineries and fruit orchards. Incidentally, visiting the falls in the winter is a chillier but much nicer experience. The food won't be any better but with less tourists and neon signs to distract you, you might find it easier to appreciate the beauty of the falls themselves. Marianna Tzabiras \u00b7 Niagara Falls is very commercialised, but well worth a trip, and three days sounds just right. Whilst the town has a Blackpool-funfair air, nothing can detract from the awesome power of the falls, and the sight of millions of gallons of water cascading down, just feet away from an ordinary road and pavement. A trip on the Maid of the Mist is essential, to experience the force and beauty of the water. All other attractions- Behind the Falls, The Boardwalk and Spanish Cable Car- are also worth doing, although not as exciting. On dry land, the IMAX cinema tells the stories of some of the people who have gone over the Falls, and survived, and the various vessels in which they did so are on show in the museum there. Definitely worth it! Deborah Vink \u00b7 Is Niagara Falls over commercialised? For the most part, yes. Is it worth a three day visit? As a native of the area, I can confidently say that three days at in Niagara Falls is probably two-and-a-half days too many, but there is more than enough in the surrounding area for a great trip. The falls are spectacular, but how long can you look at a bunch of moving water? Beyond the view of the falls, he highlight of your visit will probably be a trip on the Maid of the Mist tour boat, which takes you near the base of the falls. A visit to the state park on the American side is worthwhile, although the best views are on the Canadian side. Avoid both the American and Canadian cities of Niagara Falls, both are full of tacky tourist trash (unless you like casinos and wax museums). Instead, if your legs are up to it, take a hike down into the Niagara Gorge at Devils Hole State Park, to see the whirlpools and rapids in a more natural setting. So what do you do with the rest of your time? Visit Niagara-on-the-Lake for some quaint dining and shopping, or if you are an architecture fan, the city of Buffalo New York has some outstanding buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan, along with a magnificant art deco city hall. Buffalo's collection of grain elevators inspired the founders of modern architecture and are icons of the areas industrial heritage. Any trip to the falls should also include the city of Toronto, for great shopping, dining and nightlife. If you are going any time before April, be prepared for chilly temperatures and snow. Brian Szpakowski \u00b7 I went to Canadian Niagara on a day visit while staying with friends near Toronto last year. The resort of Niagara Falls is unbelievably tacky, and personally I wouldn't spend an hour there. This does not, however, intrude on the grandeur of the falls themselves, and one is able to view them away from all that razamataz. I was told that the Canadian side was better than the US side, but then they would say that, wouldn't they? Just north of Niagara Falls is the resort of Niagara-on-the-Lake, which is chintzy and folksy, but is a better bet if you want relative peace and quiet and a bit of culture (eg Shaw Festival Theatre) and it has a fine view across Lake Ontario to Toronto. I would recommend staying in or around Toronto and making Niagara part of an excursion. Whatever you do - Canadian hospitality is wonderful! Bruce Edwards \u00b7 Is Niagara Falls over-commercialised? Yes it is. Is it worth a three day visit? No. The attractions at Niagara, apart from the falls, can in some cases be described as North American Tacky. A full day would probably suffice to provide you with some of the best attractions. I personally would recommend, The Spanish Cable Car above the Whirlpool Rapids at the end of the Niagara River Gorge, The Board Walk beside the river itself, and the descent into the cave that takes you behind the falls a truly awesome experience. By all means base yourself at Niagara, but you will no doubt find hotel or motel prices are geared to the area. For your remaining time in the area try a visit to the town of Niagara-On-The-Lake and to one or more of the wineries producing some very reasonable wines on the Niagara Peninsula John Enell \u00b7 The answer is ONE DAY ONLY; a trip on the Maid of the Mist (boat under the falls) a few photos and that's it. Toronto is an hour-and-a-half away; spend the other time there. Anon \u00b7 The Niagara Falls are stunning, but you can soon tire of the roar of the waters and the heavy mist. We only visited the Canadian side, where the town of Niagara is tacky, with casinos and slot machines. You will probably need a car to get there, but this will enable you to visit the local wine country, and see sights such as the Welland Canal. The Niagara Parkway in particular is delightful, and we especially enjoyed a visit to Old Fort Erie, built to defend Canada against the United States in 1812. Rob Lawrence \u00b7 What nobody has mentioned yet are the wonderful wine country tours you can do in the Niagara area. I would recommend perhaps a half-day in the town of Niagara Falls itself, and another couple of days in the vicinity. Outside Canada, our wine industry is little known, but it is not insignificant. The area is beautiful, especially in autumn, with little towns and many wineries where you can stop and sample what they have to offer, and of course purchase wine and wine-related products. Renting a car is necessary and easy, and maps of the area are readily available. See Wines of Ontario for more information.
