The victory will salvage something from disastrous polls for Tony Blair who, four years ago, refused to back Mr Livingstone as the Labour candidate. With no candidate gaining more than half of first preference votes, Mr Livingstone won 828,380 of the combined first and second preference votes, beating the Conservative candidate Steven Norris, who secured 676,178 votes. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Simon Hughes, won 284, 645 of first preference votes. Former boxing promoter Frank Maloney, the Ukip candidate, came fourth with 115,665 votes, while the BNP's Julian Leppart (58,405) beat Green candidate Darren Johnson (57,331) but trailed the Respect candidate Lindsey German (67,731). Mr Livingstone made a brief speech of thanks, in which he pledged to \"leave London more beautiful\" than he found it. \"I think that is a good statement for any mayor to make,\" he said. Admitting that Mr Norris had been \"more of a threat than I would have liked\", Mr Livingstone used the Tory candidate's success to make the point that \"rumours of the death of the Tory party have been rather overplayed\". \"There is a clear choice in the months to come,\" said Mr Livingstone, in what seemed an attempt to shore up support for Mr Blair. \"A clear choice - not just about international policy, but a clear choice about our public services.\" Mr Livingstone's win spared Labour further humiliation following the party's trouncing at the local elections. The prime minister's initial refusal to back Mr Livingstone for the first mayoral elections four years ago led to the candidate's expulsion from the party. Mr Livingstone was subsequently elected after deciding to pursue his mayoral dream on a independent ticket. However, his popularity led to Mr Blair changing his mind about the firebrand politician and backing his selection as the Labour choice for a second term. In an effort to distance himself from the prime minister's policy on Iraq, Mr Livingstone played down his Labour links during his campaign. Instead, his pitch was been based around signalling his opposition to the Iraq conflict, coupled with citing the achievements of his first term. His second success means an end to Mr Norris's hopes of a return to political office. Accepting his defeat, Mr Norris said: \"I am sorry I lost but if I had to lose, I would rather lose to Ken Livingstone.\" The mayor can expect a more difficult time in his second term, having lost some of the nine-strong Labour member grouping that would have helped push through key policies in the devolved assembly. Under proportional representation, the initial election of the 14 constituency members is topped up by the nomination of 11 London-wide members drawn from the party lists. These results have yet to be declared. The Labour group has lost seats, while Respect and the Eurosceptic Ukip should have gained following wins of 5% and 10% respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
