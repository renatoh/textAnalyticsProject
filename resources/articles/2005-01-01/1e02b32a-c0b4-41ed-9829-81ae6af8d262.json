I am a sportswriter.' Within a few more sentences Ford establishes an idiom and a style for what is less a book about sport and journalism than early middle age male perplexity and disappointment: Bascombe is divorced from a wife he still loves, his son has died and his career as a writer of fiction faltered after just one promising collection of stories. The novel that he began many years before remains unfinished in a desk drawer. He won't be picking that up again. Bascombe works for an unnamed New York-based magazine and specialises in events away from the field of play, in hard luck and where-are-they-now stories. He understands, as Ford naturally does, how central sport is to the American psyche, at all levels of society, how irrational fandom can be and how so many of us live vicariously through the experiences of others - those who act rather than watch. He knows how sport, with its inherent sense of an ending, offers the shape, continuity and narrative definition so often absent from life itself. In short, it offers good stories and human drama, played out in public and often in vast supercharged stadiums and auditoria. Yet the complexities of sport are often lost on the practitioners themselves, which is why, until Tony Adams's Addicted (1998) and Paul Kimmage's The Secret Life of Tony Cascarino (2000) revitalised the genre, the ghosted sports autobiography was so lame and predictable. ('I rose to head home Jabber's cross. We hit the town hard that night. For once the gaffer turned a blind eye,' is my idea of the ideal stylistic register.) Young sportsmen do not really like talking about what they do; they simply want to do it: to kick, run, compete and score. The novelist Ben Markovits, in an article on the NBA draft in the July 2004 issue of OSM , wrote that the 'secret of sport is this: there are only stupid questions. If the mystery of sport could be explained, we could all do it.' And yet we never cease trying to explain the mystery of sport: why it means so much to so many and why we are so curious about those who succeed at it. This desire to explain is one of the main reasons why there is such a rich sports literature and why, with your help, we are seeking to compile the definitive list of the greatest sports books of all time. No genre is excluded. Fiction is permitted so long as sport is the engine of the narrative rather than being merely incidental or peripheral to it. This rules in, for instance, Bernard Malamud's fine novel about baseball, The Natural (1952), and Alan Sillitoe's story about an alienated teenage athlete at a borstal, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1959), while Martin Amis's London Fields (1988), with its diabolical darts-playing, wife-beating anti-hero Keith Talent, and LP Hartley's The Go-Between (1953), with its elegant portrayal of a village cricket match, are reluctantly ruled out. Nor, we hope, will one sport be privileged, though few would disagree that, as Chip McGrath, the former editor of the New York Times Book Review , once said: the smaller the ball, the better the writer. In the late 1950s Brian Glanville published an influential essay in Encounter magazine. 'British sports journalism,' he wrote, 'is still looking for an idiom; still waiting for its Red Smith, its Damon Runyon, its AJ Liebling, let alone its Ring Lardner; still waiting for the columnist who can be read by intellectuals without shame and working men without labour. Meanwhile it is afflicted by dichotomy: a split between mandarin intelligence and stylised stridency. This is itself a valid reflection of the class structure.' Glanville compared the position in Britain with that of the United States, where, liberated from the tyranny of the non-negotiable deadline and class constraints, writers such as Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Malamud, John Updike and Roger Angel have long written about sport with the grace, seriousness and ambition it deserves and where The New Yorker, Esquire, Sports Illustrated and even Playboy helped to establish the tradition of literate sports writing. In Britain, with its class anxieties and educational apartheid, as well as its robust and hectic newspaper culture, it has taken much longer for a comparable tradition to emerge. That hasn't stopped good books from being published, particularly good football books, such as Herbert Chapman's On Football (1933), Hunter Davies's The Glory Game (1973) or Eamon Dunphy's low-toned account of his late career struggles at Millwall, Only a Game (1976). There are, too, some wonderful books about boxing (notably Norman Mailer's The Fight, David Remnick's book about Muhammad Ali, King of the World, and AJ Liebling's The Sweet Science) and horse racing (no one who has read Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit will ever forget it). It is hard, by contrast, to think of a truly great book about rugby union or even cricket (to me, CLR James's Beyond a Boundary is, pre-eminently, an opaquely written political memoir). You may, however, disagree. In 1822 William Hazlitt published an essay called 'The Fight'. It is one of the finest journalistic accounts of a boxing match in the English language and is, in many ways, a model for Norman Mailer's account of the clash, in 1974, between Ali and George Foreman in Zaire. Both Hazlitt and indeed Mailer understand the grandeur of a great sporting contest: they each liken the fighters to something more than merely human. They understand, too, how participants and spectators alike are for the duration of the fight suspended in a state of heightened crisis: they know the fight will end, but they do not know when it will end, or how, and so they look on helplessly in thrall to events over which they have no control. And they are as interested in what is happening beyond the ring - out there among the spectators or behind the scenes, where the chancers, the money men and hangers-on gather and swarm. This is rich material for literature. The past 15 years or so have been perhaps the best ever for sports publishing in Britain. The emergence of writers such as Pete Davies and Nick Hornby, who introduced an entirely new literary genre, the stylised fan's memoir; the arrival of an imprint such as Yellow Jersey Press, which has issued a series of distinguished works of often fascinating and unpredictable subject matter; the journey sport itself has made from the margins to the very centre of our information and celebrity culture; even dare I say the launch of this magazine - all this means that never before has there been such a willing and enthusiastic audience for good sports books. I'll leave the final words to Frank Bascombe, the 38-year-old narrator of The Sportswriter: 'Why, you might ask, would a man give up a promising literary career - there were some good notices - to become a sportswriter? It's a good question. For now let me say only this: if sportswriting teaches you anything, and there is much truth to it as well as plenty of lies, it is that for your life to be worth anything you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible, searing regret. Though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined. I believe I have done these two things. Faced down regret. Avoided ruin. And I am still here to tell about it.' \u00b7 Jason Cowley, editor of Observer Sport Monthly, is a former literary editor of the New Statesman and judge of both the Booker Prize and Whitbread book of the year award.
