FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher buttonholed the Guardian's political editor, Michael White, as he emerged from prime minister's question time and asked him about today's developments. \"Gosh. You do sometimes wonder how Tony Blair keeps all those balls juggled in the air. He's spent the last 30 hours or so in Belfast dealing with the highly detailed and fantastically important politics of the Northern Ireland peace process. The general tone has been upbeat and the assembly elections have been postponed for several weeks while the parties look at the proposals for restoring confidence in power sharing. \"And as if that weren't enough for Mr Blair to deal with, Iain Duncan Smith came at him from right field with a report out today from the audit commission. It surveyed a number of NHS trusts and found some of them have been manipulating waiting list figures. Mr Blair rattled off the improvements to the NHS under Labour. But health is a real gamble for Alan Milburn, Mr Blair and Gordon Brown - who's providing the money but has slightly different views on how to go about reform. If they don't get this right with taxes rising and all this money going in, then the Tories will be ready to pounce. \"More importantly, the chancellor put out a written answer this morning announcing that the Budget would be on April 9. That's late by modern standards. The Treasury points out that it always used to be in April until the 1970s and 1980s, but it will now fall just after the start of the new financial year on April 6. The suggestion is that it will create a bureaucratic nightmare if taxes have to be adjusted for the new financial year afterwards and not before. But there's a political row, too: April 9 puts the Budget perilously close to the local, Scottish and Welsh elections on May 1 and the SNP in particular says this is wrong. You are not meant to make major announcements during an election period, and there will almost certainly be a legal challenge. On a domestic note, MPs were due to leave Westminster for an Easter recess on April 10 and will now have to debate the Budget on April 11 and 14. And heaven knows where we will be in the Iraqi crisis on April 9. So we have the makings of a first-rate row. \"Why has Mr Brown postponed it? Last year, the Budget was also postponed, but everyone understood the reason - the death of the chancellor's premature baby, Jennifer Jane - but this year, people generally accept that it's being delayed because of the general uncertainty about war. It's almost as if some people are assuming that it will all be resolved one way or another by then. \"What's the timetable? The Sun has announced that war's going to start on March 13; but many people are expecting it to begin towards the end of this month, although they disagree about how long it will last. General Wesley Clark, who ran the Nato operation in Kosovo, said in a newspaper today it will last a fortnight. Others say it will last a month. The doomsday scenario is that it will be a terrible disaster - like the British army's invasion of the Ottoman Empire up through Basra in 1914-15, which ended in a very serious defeat at a place called Kut-al-Amara. The army had to be rescued the following year. I wouldn't make any confident predictions. This is a very funny business.\" PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS A tired-looking Tony Blair today fielded questions on London's Olympic bid, the euro, cancelled NHS operations, the Middle East and Iraq. Read Matthew Tempest's minute-by-minute report. NEWS ROUND-UP This year's Budget will take place on April 9, it was announced today, the second year in a row that the chancellor has postponed it. Tony Blair held talks with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, today to pile diplomatic pressure on Moscow not to veto a United Nations resolution paving the way for war with Iraq. The foreign ministers of France, Russia and Germany were today discussing their drive against war on Iraq at a hastily arranged mini-summit in Paris, in a further sign that the UN divide on Iraq is hardening. MY FIRST VOTE Roger Evans, Tory GLA assembly member for Havering and Redbridge and, until recently, would-be mayor of London - he was pipped to the candidacy by Steve Norris - remembers his first, belated visit to the polling station. \"Politically, I was a late developer. I used my vote for the first time in the London local government elections of 1990. Having joined the Conservative party less than 12 months earlier, I decided to stand for election to the local council myself. \"Initially, I was seeking experience in the safe Labour ward of Leytonstone where I lived, but rather late in the day, one of the experienced Conservative councillors in Chingford chose to retire. I was drafted in to replace him. \"I voted for three candidates - including the father of my best friend, who kept the flag flying in difficult territory. I also found myself delivering most of their leaflets, which at least worked a few pounds off. \"At the count I was relieved to be elected with a greater majority than my predecessor and the three candidates for Leytonstone were, I suspect, equally relieved not to be successful. Labour retained control of Waltham Forest, but at least now I had a small voice in their deliberations.\" THIS WEEK'S COMPETITIONS David Davis' slogan in the last Tory leadership campaign was \"Modern Conservatives\", as Phil Avery correctly pointed out. Mr Davis, incidentally, has not sold the domain name just yet. This week, the Backbencher has a pristine copy of Robert Phillipson's English-Only Europe? Challenging Language Policy (\"Perceptive\" - Neil Kinnock.) to give away, courtesy of Routledge). To win it, tell the Backbencher the name of a certain ex-Communist close to Tony Blair who, Peter Hitchens hints, is being \"coy\" about his past. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. TOO MUCH, TOO YOUNG \"Politics is too important to ignore or ridicule,\" Young Labour urged would-be members recently. How very true - although the Backbencher suspects YL regrets urging them to \"go on a demo ... if you feel strongly about an issue.\" Leading YL's efforts to stamp out ridicule is 22-year-old Macum Jonny Reynolds, rookie NEC youth representative and new father, who assures fellow activists that he won't be hanging around Westminster \"trying to talk to MPs and special advisers\". Early days, Jonny, early days. The Backbencher will be keeping an eye on you. Just remember - if anyone invites you to join them for a curry and a Chasse-Spleen at the Cinnamon Club, just say no. Give the Backbencher a call when you next arrive at Euston. She can recommend an unlicensed little place on Drummond Street where the bill rarely exceeds a tenner. WANDERING MINDS The revelation in this week's Telegraph that Paul Baverstock - star scorer for the Westminster Wanderers football team, and survivor (some say instigator) of the Quiet Man's most recent cull of Central Office - stood as a Labour councillor in Wandsworth in 1998 intrigues the Backbencher. (\"Paul Baverstock left Labour in 1999 out of mounting frustration with Tony Blair's broken promises and failure to deliver on public services,\" a spokesman from CCO said. Presumably he was bored with Gordon's late-nineties fling with fiscal prudence and wanted him to put up national insurance right away.) She will be in touch with Paul shortly to invite him to reveal his First Vote. In the meantime, she notes that Paul is languishing at number nine in the Wanderers' \"Who's Hot?\" stakes. If any fans want to share the memory of a Baverstock own goal with her, email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS The Backbencher has no intention of getting involved in the catfight between Peter Mandelson and Andrew Pierce (\"occasional stranger to the truth ... fey ... self-congratulatory preening,\" he wrote in the Times today. Never snub Andrew at a party.) But she would like to draw readers' attention to the answer Peter gave to a constituent's question about his relationship with the Hartlepool Mail and the monkey formerly known as H'Angus. \"Townspeople can judge what the mayor does in practice and our feisty local paper, the Hartlepool Mail, will be there to help make this possible,\" Peter assured him. Feisty! Let's hope the new editor shares Peter's concern for the freedom of the press. COMING DOWN TO EARTH (SLOWLY) Redwood to mothership. Redwood to mothership: Tory leadership contest imminent. Request urgent advice on strategy. Mothership to Redwood: Temper logic with emotion. I repeat, logic with emotion. Redwood to mothership: Affirmative. Request advice on topic. Mothership to Redwood: Urban transport infrastructure. Sure enough, during an interview with a low-cirulation broadsheet, John reassured the interviewer: \"It's emotional, too; I feel it. I feel rage in traffic jams.\" FAMILY VOICES Harold Pinter is rarely cheerful at the best of times. And the Iraqi crisis has only stoked his hatred of the imperialist butchers, Bush and Blair. Fortunately, his handsome stepson Orlando Fraser - a 35-year-old bridge-playing barrister - has neatly dodged Harold's wrath by becoming the Tory PPC for Devon North. The Backbencher imagines the news took a while to sink in in the Pinter household.
