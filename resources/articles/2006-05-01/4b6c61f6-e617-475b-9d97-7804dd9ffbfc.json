GMG said it would retain a majority stake in the business after the float, which is expected to take place before the end of its current financial year in March 2007. The group reached its decision after hiring investment bank Merrill Lynch to conduct a strategic review of its assets, which include the Guardian Unlimited web operation, the Real Radio and Smooth FM radio stations, the Manchester Evening News and 40 other regional newspapers. \"This will enable the group to retain a majority stake in Trader Media Group, while enabling further investment in other group businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities,\" said GMG. The announcement follows months of speculation over the outcome of the review which included reports, denied by GMG, that the group was considering the sale of its regional newspapers. Last year the group rebuffed takeover approaches for its five radio stations. GMG is wholly owned by the Scott Trust, formed in 1936 to safeguard the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian. The group bought control of Trader Media nearly three years ago when it acquired the 52% of the company that it did not own from private equity firm BC Partners. The deal valued the cash-generative business at \u00a31.14bn. Trader Media owns 70 publications including Auto Trader, Britain's leading motoring website and magazine. Its titles have a combined circulation of 1.5m and it employs nearly 4,000 people in the UK, Ireland, Holland, Italy and South Africa. The business reported pre-tax profits of \u00a385.4m last year, on revenues of \u00a3304.9m. GMG turnover rose 18.4% over the same period to \u00a3751.9m, though revenues rose 3.7% to \u00a3444.1m if the deal to take full control of Trader Media is excluded. GMG has yet to appoint advisers on the flotation, but Merrill Lynch is expected to play a leading role. GMG declined to comment on the size of the stake that will be floated. Alex DeGroote, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said Trader Media's online assets would play an important role in valuing the business because British regional newspapers were struggling with a decline in the print-based classified market. Rightmove, the online property advertising site, floated at 335p a share in March and now trades around the 360p level. This year, Amsterdam-based Trader Classified, which is not connected to Trader Media, raised $650m (\u00a3351.6m) by floating its central and eastern European business on the London Stock Exchange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
