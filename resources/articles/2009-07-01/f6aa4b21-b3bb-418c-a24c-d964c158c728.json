When men care to exert themselves they can easily double their workload. They can, for instance, do their nine-to-five job and watch the Ashes. They can do child care and watch the Ashes. They can wash the dishes and watch the Ashes. They can do anything and watch the Ashes. Ideally, though, they would like to be watching more sport and watching the Ashes. To this end, I took myself to Newmarket on Thursday in search of the near unbeatable combination which is live racing combined with televised cricket (this is, I think, edged out by live cricket accompanied by televised racing, but I wouldn't argue the point too strongly). Not only was there above-average racing to be had at Headquarters, it was also Ladies Day and East Anglia's finest had high-heeled it to the track for the second biggest social occasion in the region. (The first \u2013 and I would argue this every time \u2013 is the Norfolk Show which, combining top-quality livestock competition with niche activities such as little men being fired from cannons truly offers something for everybody. Indeed, now that the Royal Agricultural Show has, in the face of competition from PlayStation, Xbox and the Wii, given up the ghost, \"The Norfolk\" can lay claim to being the only show in town, or country.) Among the gang at Newmarket was a war correspondent who soon exposed (it has been a canard-crunching week) the falsity that there is any similarity between gambling and soldiering. Gamblers are forever using martial terminology to make tawdry investments sound more macho. Poker players, in particular, love to talk about killing and slaying when their interminable tales of \"raising with QK suited after the flop came J, 9, 6\" really do sound tame in comparison to true stories about fighting the Taliban. Unfortunately, the assembled gang, while long in hacks, was short in expertise and we were soon losing. Since time began, and before even Pinkie at Brighton, gangs have been vital to racing. This is because if enough people are gathered together to go racing then it is statistically likely that one will be a winner and if one is a winner then it is easy for others to succumb to the illusion, fortified by the winner buying them drinks, that everyone is a winner. But this did not happen on Thursday. Everyone was a loser. And all this losing in front of the dispiriting backdrop of Ponting and Katich (the drabbest of department stores) grinding out their risk-free hundreds. Grim is not the word. Forgive me, then, if I sought refuge, and a much-needed change in fortune, with heavy bets on the Best Dressed Lady competition. As ever the renewal of this competitive Group 1 contest attracted a bigger crowd to the parade ring to see the runners go through their paces than any of the equine contests. As ever there was much jiggery pokery after the field was reduced to 10 (for safety reasons?) and flabbergasted mums assailed the judges pointing at the wares of their daughters and demanding late inclusion. As ever there was plenty of wit from the onlookers as one friend of a contestant, on hearing that the winning purse was 52 bottles of champagne, said: \"Bye bye, Blossom Hill.\" Quite the best clarion call I have heard recently. As ever, I did my dough, backing a woman whom, I am fairly certain, finished a good second at Punchestown last spring but failed to frank the form. When your luck is out, your luck is out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
