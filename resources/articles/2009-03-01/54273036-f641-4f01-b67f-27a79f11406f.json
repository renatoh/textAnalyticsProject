British Shooting's chairman, Phil Boakes, reacted with \"utter dismay\" to the decision, which he said would leave no legacy despite costing more than \u00a340m, and vowed to carry on fighting for an alternative venue at the National Shooting Centre in Bisley. After a meeting of the Olympic board yesterday, it said that following a feasibility study of two alternative sites in Bisley and Barking, shooting would remain at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south-east London.\"The Olympic Delivery Authority has conducted a thorough review process of all three locations. However, the board still feels that Woolwich is the best choice of venue,\" said the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, Lord Coe. \"It is an iconic venue close to the Olympic Village, with a strong shooting heritage, and is one of the Greenwich cluster of Olympic and Paralympic venues.\" The decision, following a three month review that flowed from last year's KPMG audit of all temporary venues, provoked immediate condemnation from Boakes.\"My reaction is one of utter dismay. This is very, very disappointing,\" he said. \"The main thing is that there is no legacy for shooting now. This is more than \u00a340m of public money being spent and there will be nothing to show for it after 2012. This is not about sport, it's about politics.\" But organisers claim the alternative venues would have been even more expensive and that Woolwich remained the most cost-effective option. Ranges, targets and other infrastructure would be reused, said LOCOG. Organisers argue that the logistical challenges and extra costs required to upgrade Bisley and provide athlete accommodation on the site make it prohibitively expensive. Yesterday's decision leaves the only outstanding question mark over 2012 venues around a temporary structure on the Greenwich Peninsula slated to host badminton and other sports. A decision will be made later this year on whether to build it or move the events to Wembley or Excel.Meanwhile the ODA and Locog will also have to overcome opposition from some likely participants and local residents over the decision to host equestrian events in Greenwich Park. Zara Phillips is among those who have criticised the decision, which will not leave any legacy facilities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
