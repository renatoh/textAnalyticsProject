The American author\u2019s Census, which follows a terminally ill father and his son as they conduct a survey of a nameless country, beat works including Guy Gunaratne\u2019s Booker-longlisted novel In Our Mad and Furious City to the \u00a35,000 award at the Durham book festival on Thursday evening. The prize is for work that follows in the footsteps of Burn \u2013 \u201cnovels which dare to enter history and interrogate the past; non-fiction adventurous enough to inhabit characters and events in order to create new and vivid realities\u201d \u2013 and has been won in the past by writers including Paul Kingsnorth and Benjamin Myers. Ball said: \u201cFrom the first, [Census] was for my brother, a person who no longer exists (he is in the ground)\u201d. His brother Abram died at the age of 24. \u201cAs his, it is a book pointed at a world that we do not live in, but perhaps could,\u201d the writer said. \u201cI would like for people to read the work because I think we can see differently than we do. We need not be limited by the poverty that is forced upon us, when we are already, every one of us, so rich in sight.\u201d Artist Gillian Wearing, who was one of the judges for the prize, described the experience of reading the \u201cbeautiful, moving\u201d Census as \u201clike walking through someone\u2019s surreal grieving mind as they attempt to make sense of existence\u201d. Carol Gorner of the Gordon Burn Trust said Ball was a very fitting winner. \u201cGordon Burn cared deeply about writing style,\u201d she said, \u201cand he also cared deeply that those people who aren\u2019t obvious subject matter should be written about. This strange and beautifully written book is perfectly matched to the aims of the prize.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
