Take it from a Guant\u00e1namo Bay lawyer", "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a quiz question: how many famous songs, or films, can you name that address the serious contemporary issues of torture and rendition? There aren\u2019t many. When I think of music in connection with our US secret prisons, it is the kind blasted at prisoners at deafening volume, all day and night. One such unfortunate was my client Ahmed Rabbani, a Karachi taxi driver sold to the US for a bounty, accompanied by the false accusation that he was Hassan Ghul, a notorious Pakistani terrorist. That was 10 September 2002; I saw him recently on my 39th visit to Guant\u00e1namo Bay where he has been held for 17 years without charge or trial. Artists tend to be leery of entering the political fray, which is a pity, as surely art is just another medium that can bring power to the powerless. Happily, the weekend before I saw Ahmed, I heard a single from the first Who album in many years. The song is Pete Townshend\u2019s take on the world\u2019s most infamous prison: \u201cDown in Guant\u00e1namo, we still got the ball and chain. That pretty piece of Cuba, designed to cause men pain.\u201d The censors will never allow Ahmed to hear the song, and my own imitation of Roger Daltrey\u2019s growl was a poor substitute. Yet Ahmed and the other men were thrilled that someone remembered they existed. At the same time, Amazon has released The Report, starring Adam Driver as Senate staffer Daniel J Jones. Jones worked for Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), investigating the use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (\u201cEITs\u201d), which the CIA vehemently claimed did not amount to torture. All one really needs to know is that the Gestapo\u2019s euphemism for torture was Versch\u00e4rfte Vernehmung, which translates as \u201cEnhanced Interrogation\u201d. Various Nazis were hanged for applying \u201cVV\u201d to their prisoners. The subject of The Report could barely be more dry: in real life, Driver\u2019s character spent five years in the bowels of the CIA documenting the abuse of prisoners, writing his 6,400 page \u201creport\u201d. Yet the film is gripping and \u2013 as far as it goes \u2013 compellingly accurate. I likewise spent long hours in a windowless room reviewing classified evidence, and I empathise with Driver\u2019s descent into paranoia when would-be whistleblowers accost him beside the concrete pillars of the subterranean Agency garage. As he encounters proof of the torture, the most incriminating papers begin to disappear. This prompts him to leak one document to a senator, who then reveals it in a public hearing. In turn, the CIA tries to have Driver prosecuted, and starts bugging the senators themselves in their cover-up. The movie does not flinch from the torture to which the prisoners were subjected. Throughout, the action cuts from Langley and Capitol Hill to dark cells in Thailand and Afghanistan where American interrogators are inflicting unspeakable pain and suffering upon the men they (often wrongly) believe to be terrorists. It is exceptionally rare for a film to show US personnel torturing their captives, and the film-makers are to be commended for their courage. The concluding battle comes between Senator Feinstein and President Barack Obama, the constitutional law scholar who insists on replacing Driver\u2019s massive tome with a heavily redacted \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d. I discussed the film with Ahmed. Indeed, I told him that watching closely as the camera pans around the CIA basement I saw his picture pinned to the wall. He acknowledged it would be hard to tell the whole story of CIA torture in two hours, but felt that The Report missed some important details. In the \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d Ahmed is listed as one of 17 victims whose torture was \u201cunauthorised\u201d. The film might have considered whether torture is morally more or less acceptable if it has been \u201cauthorised\u201d by the president. The larger omission is in the report itself. Daniel Jones did not talk to any of the victims: Ahmed asked how we would feel if an inquest into genocide in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia looked no further than the diaries of the murderers? Ahmed will not be allowed to see the film in Guant\u00e1namo, but he has read the actual \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d as he appears in it several times. He was surprised that some CIA agents concluded he was not Hassan Ghul just 24 hours after he was originally kidnapped. Why, then, did they render him to the Dark Prison in Kabul? There, he endured more than 540 days of torture (he did not keep count, but the report helpfully told him). He learned that at some point in his misery, the US captured the real Hassan Ghul and brought him to the same prison. Ghul was \u201ccooperative\u201d and spent only two days there. He was later released back to Pakistan and went back to his terrorism, before being killed by a drone in 2012. Meanwhile, Ahmed was sent to Cuba, to rot as a \u201cforever prisoner\u201d. Much more that could have been said, then, but given its subject The Report is a surprisingly entertaining film. Most importantly, it shines a light on an important story in recent history, and if we hide our sordid mistakes, we will be destined to repeat them.
