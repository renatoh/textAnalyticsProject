Did he deserve any? And if he didn\u2019t, who did? Those were the questions at the center of the billionaire\u2019s second day of testimony in the defamation case brought by Vernon Unsworth, a British cave explorer, against the Tesla entrepreneur. Unsworth told the federal court in Los Angeles that Musk\u2019s 15 July 2018 tweet calling him \u201cpedo guy\u201d made him feel \u201chumiliated, ashamed, dirty\u201d. The court is considering if the tweet constituted defamation. As jurors heard on Tuesday, Musk made his remarks after Unsworth mocked the miniature submarine that he had built and delivered to the rescue site. In an interview on CNN, Unsworth asserted that the underwater vehicle would never have worked, and suggested that Musk \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. Musk and his attorney, Alex Spiro, attempted to present the Tesla chief executive as sincere, self-sacrificing and modest when Musk took the stand for a second day on Wednesday. Musk denied he had ever sought to take credit for helping the cave rescue: \u201cThe pump and generator team deserve immense credit,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody talks about them.\u201d Under cross-examination by Unsworth\u2019s attorney, Lin Wood, one of the reasons for this came into focus, however. Musk was asked why he had used Twitter to apologize to Unsworth for the \u201cpedo guy\u201d remark, rather than contacting him directly or giving an interview on television. Musk said: \u201cMost things I say on Twitter will generally get some press awareness \u2026 If I write something on Twitter, it will get reported.\u201d Indeed. Wood introduced into evidence what appeared to be dozens of tweets sent by Musk documenting the process of building the submarine and delivering it to Thailand, including a video showing SpaceX engineers testing the tube in a swimming pool. Faced with the volume of tweets that Musk had just admitted were likely to generate press coverage, the billionaire responded defensively. \u201cI mean, I tweet a lot in general \u2026 I was looking for feedback from the public to see if there were any improvements they could suggest. \u201cI frequently solicit feedback on Tesla car design, even rockets,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve incorporated quite a lot of feedback from Twitter on Tesla car design.\u201d Unsaid, but obvious to the members of the media who chased Musk out of the courtroom the moment he was dismissed, was that nobody was talking about the pump and generator teams because everyone was talking about Musk and his mini-sub. Much of the rest of Musk\u2019s testimony involved a close parsing of the degree of flippancy that should be accorded to \u201cpedo\u201d versus \u201cpedo guy\u201d, and further questions about Musk\u2019s intent when he deployed the phrase against Unsworth. \u201cI did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile,\u201d Musk said. Unsworth speaks After sitting silently with his attorneys for the first day and a half of the trial, Unsworth took the stand on Wednesday afternoon to describe the impact of Musk\u2019s words. \u201cWhen you combine \u2018sus\u2019 with \u2018pedo guy\u2019, I took it to mean I was being branded a pedophile,\u201d Unsworth said with obvious distress, his voice breaking multiple times. \u201cI feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty \u2026 I was effectively given a life sentence without parole. At times I feel very vulnerable. It hurts to talk about it.\u201d The 64-year-old Briton\u2019s noticeable discomfort provided a striking contrast with Musk\u2019s appearance that included references to the Simpsons, marijuana and his own net worth. Unsworth said he had worked as a consultant on three books about the cave rescue, and appeared in two documentaries, for which he was paid a total of about $3,000. His testimony will continue Thursday. Ineptitude and heroism The head of Musk\u2019s family office, Jared Birchall, also testified on Wednesday about efforts to dig up dirt on Unsworth that might prove the cave explorer was actually a pedophile. Birchall testified to hiring James Howard, without performing any due diligence. Howard was a private investigator who falsely claimed to have worked for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the financier George Soros. Birchall\u2019s own attempt to use a false identity while interacting with Howard was unsuccessful, but provided the jury with the opportunity to learn that he had previously used the pseudonym \u201cJames Brickhouse\u201d to arrange travel for Musk\u2019s family, help a Libyan refugee, and make inquiries about purchasing the domain name justballs.com. A former wealth manager for Merrill Lynch, Birchall offered Howard a $10,000 bonus if he provided proof of \u201cnefarious behaviour\u201d by Unsworth. It was Howard\u2019s fictional reports to Birchall that formed the basis of Musk\u2019s email to a BuzzFeed News journalist falsely alleging that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d. The fourth witness to testify Wednesday was Richard Stanton, one of the undisputed heroes of the cave rescue effort. An internationally recognized cave diver, Stanton and his dive partner were the first to locate the missing boys in the cave, and Stanton directed the subsequent extraction efforts. Musk and his lawyers invoked Stanton\u2019s name numerous times, noting that the British volunteer had invited Musk\u2019s contributions and provided guidance on what was needed. \u201cIt is absolutely worth continuing with the development of this system in as timely a manner as possible,\u201d Stanton wrote in an 8 July email to Musk that was introduced as evidence. In another email, the diver advised: \u201cIf you make a capsule that tightly encloses a 15-year-old boy it will fit through.\u201d On the witness stand however, Stanton paid tribute to Unsworth\u2019s role in the rescue. \u201cHe was the first person to greet us and guide us through the chaos. He had the best knowledge of that cave \u2026 He guided us through the geography and culture.\u201d Stanton also testified that Unsworth\u2019s description and drawings of the cave passage were more detailed and valuable than other surveys of the area. Under cross-examination, Stanton resisted efforts by Musk\u2019s attorneys to diminish the importance of Unsworth\u2019s contributions. The cave diver also spoke twice to reporters outside the courtroom on issues that he had not been able to testify on, due to objections by Musk\u2019s attorneys and rulings by the judge. Stanton was \u201cacutely disappointed\u201d when he saw photos of the submarine Musk built, he said, noting that the pod appeared to lack life-support, ballast or trim systems. \u201cI realized it could not work.\u201d Asked whether he agreed that it was a PR stunt, the diver said: \u201cI think he had well-meaning intentions, but there must have been a point when surely his engineers discovered it was not possible, and what happened from that point, when he decided to bring it on site and showboat \u2026 you can decide for yourselves.\u201d Stanton also said that Musk\u2019s visit to the cave with a non-functioning mini-sub \u201cdetracted from the rescue effort\u201d by taking up the time of rescue personnel. Stanton addressed the media again after hearing Unsworth\u2019s testimony. \u201cWatching Vernon being questioned is the first time I\u2019ve really seen the impact on him personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful Elon Musk isn\u2019t here to be able to look him in the eye and see the damage that he\u2019s caused.\u201d The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
