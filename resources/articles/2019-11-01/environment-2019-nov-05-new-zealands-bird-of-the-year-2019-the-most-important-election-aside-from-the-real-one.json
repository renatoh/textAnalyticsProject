Something funny was going on with the shag. Of course, by then \u2013 the 13th year of the competition \u2013 organisers knew to expect dodgy dealings in New Zealand\u2019s bird of the year poll. If a nationwide vote to name a favourite native bird sounds like innocuous good fun \u2013 a creative means of celebrating unique, threatened fauna \u2013 you may be underestimating bird of the year. Coordinated by the Royal Forest &amp; Bird Society, an environmental nongovernmental organisation, it is often described as the country\u2019s most important election \u2013 second only to, you know, the actual elections. Since 2017, too, it has had the same validation as two other Kiwi creations, pavlova and Russell Crowe: Australia has tried to pass it off as its own. From a total of 900 votes received (some by post) in the first vote in 2005, bird of the year has grown to about 28,000 in 2015 and more than 48,000 in 2018 \u2013 nearly double the number that just elected the mayor of Wellington. For this year\u2019s competition, voting has been changed to proportional representation, allowing five choices, owing to persistent feedback that it was \u201ctoo hard for people to choose just one bird\u201d, according to a Forest &amp; Bird spokeswoman, Megan Hubscher. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some interesting campaign strategies starting to take shape around that as well \u2013 for example, the penguin species are grouping together to campaign for \u2018five ticks to penguins\u2019.\u201d As in politics, electioneering has become more advanced. Each bird has a campaign manager or team, who stop at nothing to give their species the edge. In the past there have been Tinder profiles (for the black stilt), tattoos (of the saddleback) and celebrity endorsements (by Stephen Fry and Bill Bailey, for the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d and the takah\u0113). It is a testament to the close competition that, in 14 years, no species has won twice. Last year\u2019s victor, with 12% of the vote, the kerer\u016b \u2013 the native wood pigeon known for gorging itself on fermented fruits and making drunken crash landings into trees \u2013 took flight early on in the competition with memes celebrating the \u201cmagnificent thicc boi\u201d. Team Kereru promised to \u201cgovern for the many\u201d, while Jacinda Ardern \u2013 who had backed the black petrel or t\u0101iko, \u201cthe bogan of birds\u201d \u2013 accepted the outcome of the democratic process with dignity. A seabird is yet to win bird of the year. A vote for \u2018the underbird\u2019 Another underdog is the banded dotterel or pohowera, a skittish little plover, for which George Hobson of Wellington has served as campaign manager since 2015, when he was 11 years old. His campaign was \u201cpretty average\u201d back then, he admits, winning just under 150 votes; this year he has been directly contacting businesses, NGOs, \u201cbasically as many people as I can\u201d to ask for their support. His highest profile supporter so far is the former PM and UN development programme head Helen Clark. Hobson, now 16, says a vote for the nationally vulnerable \u201cunderbird\u201d is a vote for diversity: \u201cOut of the 14 bird of the year winners we\u2019ve had, eight of them have had names beginning with the letter \u2018k\u2019 \u2013 so we really need to change it up a little bit. And we\u2019re playing a reasonably fair and straightforward campaign \u2013 compared to some others.\u201d Not every bird plays by the rules \u2013 the black-billed gull ran a notoriously foul-mouthed campaign in 2017, calling the kiwi \u201ca fat flightless fuck\u201d \u2013 and the competition is reliably derailed by voter fraud. In 2018 the shag was among 16 species to be boosted by fraudulent votes. In 2017 someone in Christchurch used a random email address generator to lodge 112 votes for the white-faced heron. (The black-billed gull called it racist.) And in 2015 hundreds of illegal votes for the North Island kokako sent it briefly to first place, before the bird\u2019s campaign manager nobly reported foul play. The culprits, two sisters in Auckland, were later identified by their apologetic father. \u201cI actually think we were mostly impressed that two teenagers went to the effort of hacking the system for their favourite bird,\u201d says Kimberley Collins, then competition coordinator. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Hey, maybe don\u2019t do it again \u2013 but good on you for caring so much.\u2019\u201d Collins, a freelance science communicator, managed bird of the year for four years and remembers it fondly as a \u201cstressful time\u201d. This is her first year not formally involved, though she is backing the hoiho, the yellow-eyed penguin. \u201cAnd one of our campaign values is we don\u2019t heckle other birds, because we think other birds are awesome.\u201d The passion \u2013 and occasional skulduggery \u2013 is a testament to that personal connection that most New Zealanders feel to their native birds, Collins says: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of friendly heckling but also a lot of support, because we\u2019re all people who care desperately about our native birds, and We don\u2019t want to see any extinctions in our lifetimes.\u201d \u2018Catering for the bird nerds\u2019 In the absence of any large native mammals \u2013 there are two species of bat that, by and large, fail to capture public imagination \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s idiosyncratic birdlife serve as its best known and loved symbols of its unique biodiversity. Some New Zealanders would even have their namesake bird on the national flag, as was memorably established in the 2015 referendum. The challenge for bird of the year, Collins says, has been striking the balance between keeping it fresh and fun for the public \u2013 \u201cbut also catering for the bird nerds who get, um, quite caught up in it\u201d. A teenager once sent her a spreadsheet of every bird species and subspecies from New Zealand, the Chatham Islands and the sub-Antarctic islands. There were more than 200 \u2013 not practicable for an online poll. Another voter emailed Collins \u201cmultiple times, absolutely furious\u201d at the inclusion of the pukeko because the swamphen species is also found in Australia. The nation\u2019s enthusiasm for its endemic wildlife is not always matched by efforts to understand or protect it. A 2016 Lincoln University study found that the perception of native species\u2019 condition is largely adequate to good. Yet a report by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services this year found that more than 4,000 animals and birds were at risk of extinction. The serious side to bird of the year is engaging the public in the breadth of New Zealand\u2019s birdlife, beyond species that appear on the banknotes \u2013 as well as the challenges they face. For Hobson, staring down his fifth campaign year, he admits: \u201cI\u2019d quite like to see a banded dotterel win\u201d \u2013 and with the former PM\u2019s backing, the chances of the \u201csmall little brown birds that run around our beaches\u201d have never been better. \u201cIf we can connect people with our beautiful birds, then that\u2019s almost a gateway for them to start caring more about conservation,\u201d he says. Collins agrees that a passion for birds can lead on to an interest in the rest of New Zealand\u2019s flora and fauna. The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network already runs plant of the year, she notes. \u201cI\u2019ve always personally been a big advocate for bat of the year, because it would be so easy to run,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo bats. One tick.\u201d \u2022 Voting is at birdoftheyear.org.nz. The winning bird will be announced on Monday 11 November We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand.
