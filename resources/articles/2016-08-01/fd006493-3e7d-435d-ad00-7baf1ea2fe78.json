Currently, the average price for a room in the capital is \u00a3135 and rising because today\u2019s hotel stay, with more than 80% occupancy, is, as the jargon goes, an experiential luxury. \u201cBD\u201d is Richard Born and Ira Drukier, formerly in engineering and medicine; they are now billionaires and the biggest owners of boutique hotels in New York. \u201cThe aesthetic nature of the hotel business has evolved slowly,\u201d Drukier said in an interview last year. \u201cThey have become stylised\u2026 hotels are more than just a bed and water.\u201d And then some. Possibly Drukier was referring to the swimming pool that De Niro \u201chelped to implement\u201d in the BD Greenwich Hotel framed with beams from a centuries-old Japanese farmhouse. One of the many follies of uber-affluence is that people will pay hugely to grope their way around the black-painted lobby of a dimly lit designer hotel, manned by undertaker-suited staff, sphinx-like, snooty and clothed to be indistinguishable from the decor. Inevitably, too, the lavatories are marked by obscure post-modern hieroglyphics and the cost of a glass of water is heading to the hourly rate of the London living wage (\u00a39.40 and in the dreams of many of the abysmally paid hotel staff who carry the cases, clean rooms, stock the bars, cook and work as below-stairs porters.) In the classic 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino, Robert De Niro plays Sam \u201cAce\u201d Rothstein, a mafia associate, sent in to run a crooked Las Vegas gambling joint. At one point, he says: \u201cThere are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\u201d Last year, at the Ludlow in New York, , a non-unionised BD hotel (where De Niro is not involved), the management showed the way it prefers to do it. It allegedly engaged in tactics to persuade its staff not to vote in favour of joining the strong New York union, the Hotel Trades Council (HTC). Hints were made that staff would be sacked if they defied management\u2019s wishes. Nevertheless, the staff voted 97% in favour. In New York, a large number of hotels are unionised. HTC has 32,000 members including those working in other BD hotels. Ludlow staff, pre-HTC, earned around $14 (\u00a311) an hour. In contrast, staff in HTC hotels can earn up to $27 an hour plus free family medical insurance, pensions, proper holiday pay and a guaranteed working week. In London, is that going to be the way? Possibly not. A report published on Tuesday, Unethical London, drawn up by the Unite Hotel Workers branch, rightly charges that, in London, global hotel chains harass, block and intimidate to stop collective union action, contrary to global employment agreements. In a predominantly non-unionised climate, tips \u2013 12% to 15% of bills \u2013 are \u201creallocated\u201d and pay is poor. Employees are pressured to work extra time without pay and complaints or any sign of union interest are too often dealt with by a cut in shifts on zero-hours contracts or by awarding the complainer with extra rooms to clean. Staff are, in many cases, disrespected and disregarded; ill, depressed and broke. All of which, the report says, makes, \u201cLondon one of the most unethical tourist destinations in the world\u201d \u2013 a highly profitable one. Hotel and tourism is the fourth largest employer in the country. By 2025, tourism is predicted to be a \u00a3257.4bn industry. It is shameful that collective action and the right to join a trade union are blocked, allowing exploitation and fear to flourish. Over the past several decades, what has happened in hospitality and tourism offers in miniature a picture of general developments in employment. In the 1940s, Conrad Hilton may have had his flaws but it was clear who was accountable. His name was on the business. Now, hedge funds and financiers are the obscure investors and, as the Unite report points out, hotel buildings are sold, brands are franchised and major hotels are atomised with different services outsourced, each new contract driving wages and conditions down further. A process, which, without collective action, kills the spirit of the hardest workers. Seventy per cent of UK hotel employees are immigrants. Post Brexit, if they go, who will replace them? The Unite report makes demands that are modest \u2013 a wage on which you can live; safe, secure work; guaranteed hours every week; training opportunities and a collective voice and union representation. That these rights are still denied demonstrates how successive governments, Labour included, have accepted that, in the words of social historian Selina Todd, \u201cprofit making and the people\u2019s welfare [are] ultimately irreconcilable\u201d. In New York, in addition to trade unionism, collectivism has channelled into consumer clout. A kitemark operates so that you know that the hotel you choose has a fair policy on wages and conditions; not too difficult for TripAdvisor et al to add to its criteria? It works for fair trade, so why not for many of the millions labouring in hotel and tourism? Or don\u2019t we care enough? Today, perhaps, we are all travellers, nomads not just geographically but politically, too. In a recent column in the New York Times, David Brooks suggested that young people, reared on individualism, privacy and the power of the dollar, preferred the community and class solidarity of the Bernie Sanders campaign to the \u201cboomer autonomy\u201d of Hillary Clinton. Brooks quotes from Sebastian Junger\u2019s book, Tribe, in which he describes how 18th-century colonials, captured by Native Americans, when freed, often chose to return to the materially poorer life for a society of communal living. Junger writes: \u201cThey would have practised extremely close and involved childcare. They would have done almost everything in the company of others.\u201d Money talks, but what also has a powerful eloquence is empathy and the determination to look out for each other. Paradoxically, individual choice can add up to a collective message. And with a kitemark system in operation, this could inform your next choice of hotel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
