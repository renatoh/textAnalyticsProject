The west African country is one of a number currently affected by the most deadly outbreak of the disease to date, which the director of the World Health Organisation said on Friday was \"moving faster than efforts to control it\". There was some confusion about a second athlete from the country, after Sierra Leone's chef de mission at the Games told the Daily Telegraph that another cyclist, Mohamed Tholley, had failed to compete in the same event and had possibly absconded. \"The situation is very serious at home, and it is possible this is why he does not want to return,\" the paper quoted Unisa Deen Kargbo as saying. But Brock-Doyle later said the organisers were not alarmed. \"We have now contacted the chef de mission and asked if they are concerned about the welfare of this athlete, has he gone missing, and whether they would like us to help, and they have said they are not concerned about the welfare or whereabouts of this athlete.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
