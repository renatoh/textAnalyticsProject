The revelation came in a message written 12 days ago by the Bolton Wanderers chairman, Phil Gartside, to his fellow FA board members and representatives of the professional leagues. Gartside was writing in response to what he called the unacceptable tone of a complaint by Ian Watmore, then the FA's chief executive, to the board and leagues about leaks from within the organisation. Gartside wrote: \"Unfortunately in the industry we are involved in we are subject to a great deal of interest from the press and I did actually point this out to our CEO [Watmore] at the interview prior to his appointment. We have had several incidents of this nature for a very long time \u2013 however, to react by sending a general communication which could also be leaked or briefed in my opinion is not acceptable. We have even had private detective agency investigate a previous incident and as far as I am aware it did not reach a conclusion.\" The FA yesterday declined to comment when asked whether a private investigator had indeed been used to make inquiries into the leaks. But it is believed there will not be a probe into the leaking of the angry exchange of private emails, which coincided with Watmore quitting his job. Within 24 hours of Gartside's email, the FA announced that Watmore had resigned. Insiders corroborate the chronology offered by Lord Triesman, the FA chairman, which is that Watmore had already tendered his resignation to him on Friday 19 March, 48 hours before Gartside berated the chief executive. The damaging passages related to Watmore's warning that if he ever discovered the source of the leak he would \"damage beyond repair\" the person's reputation. \"I am extremely concerned that the situation may get out of control and would suggest that we immediately convene an emergency board meeting to address the concerns of the CEO and the resulting email on Saturday evening,\" wrote Gartside. Several observers have interpreted this last paragraph as being what precipitated Watmore's resignation. They speculate that Watmore, an independently wealthy man, had decided such a dressing-down to be beneath him and stepped down accordingly. However, Triesman and others at the FA deny this, insisting Watmore had already made clear his intentions two days previously. Cole off the hook Anyone hoping for the public crucifixion of Ashley Cole looks likely to be disappointed. Cole was in hot water after it emerged he had misled Chelsea officials over his dalliance with a woman during an overnight stay in a club hotel. There was talk of a sizeable fine \u2013 possibly running as high as \u00a3400,000 \u2013 coming his way, but there are strong indications he could get away with it. The club are said to be carefully nursing him during his recovery from a broken ankle and, even if he is to be pursued, Chelsea have a policy of keeping private any disciplinary action they take. The best guess is that when theChelsea's senior players and staff were called to a meeting with the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, the manager, Carlo Ancelotti, the owner, Roman Abramovich, and his lieutenant, Eugene Tenenbaum, the collective rollicking meant Cole was dealt with. Elephants to pack trunks Sven-Goran Eriksson's management of an African team at an African World Cup will not lead to his players preparing on that continent. Eriksson is in the process of identifying European warm-up camps for his Ivory Coast team, since the lion's share of the Elephants are based with European clubs. It is understood Switzerland is the current favourite. Are F1 trends electric? The days of the 100% electric Formula One could be approaching. The sport's regulators, the FIA, noted that the stars of the recent Geneva Motor Show were electric-powered concept cars capable of incredible speeds. Keen to ensure that F1 is viewed more widely to be greening itself, the FIA is exploring all forms of alternative powering for its cars, including hybrid engines and cleaner fuels, and has not ruled out the possibility of running pure electric cars in the future. The FIA knows that engine sounds are part of the \"grandstand experience\" and that it might be a controversial development for petrol-heads. But if it does pursue development of a 100% electric car, at least the Scalextric sets of their childhoods will have given F1 fans an early taste of the possibilities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
