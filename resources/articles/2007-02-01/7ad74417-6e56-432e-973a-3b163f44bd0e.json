Boiler rooms - usually based offshore - recommend shares to unsuspecting investors through hard-sell techniques. Often the shares are not listed on stock exchanges and can be very difficult for investors to sell. In this instance, though, the FSA obtained injunctions after admitting it was investigating \"potential misconduct\" in share dealings in a small listed company, Northern Lynx. The property development and investment group, listed on the Alternative Investment Market, admitted that it was \"aware that a number of Northern Lynx shares may have been acquired by one or more unregistered brokers\". The high court has granted objections against Chesteroak, based in the UK, Bingen Investments, incorporated in Gibraltar, and Samuel Nathan Kahn, because the FSA believes they are involved in assisting overseas boiler rooms to operate in the UK. They must stop their activities and their assets are frozen. Neither of the companies nor Mr Kahn are authorised by the FSA, which means that investors who may have lost money will be not be able to claim compensation from the financial services compensation scheme or make a complaint to the financial ombudsman service. The trio are thought to have attracted at least \u00a31m from around 400 people. The FSA believes Chesteroak has been dealing in investments without the necessary authorisations while Bingen was arranging investment deals. Mr Kahn is \"knowingly involved\" in these activities - usually regulated by the FSA - without authorisation, the FSA alleged. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
