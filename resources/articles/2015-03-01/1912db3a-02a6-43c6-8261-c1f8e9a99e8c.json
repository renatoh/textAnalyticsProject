France may have had an underwhelming season but, as Courtney Lawes succinctly put it, they do still have some \u201cbig dudes\u201d with the physical attributes to dent English hopes of lifting the trophy on Saturday. In theory, everything is in the hosts\u2019 favour at Twickenham \u2013 home advantage, a superior points difference, kicking off last \u2013 but across the Channel they prefer to imagine an alternative scenario. A French win by eight points or more, coupled with defeats for Wales and Ireland, would deliver the title into Gallic hands and stun everybody from Tipperary to Toulouse. By the time Saturday\u2019s final game kicks off that remote chance may have already disappeared but the sheer bulk of Yoann Maestri, Alexandre Flanquart, Romain Taofif\u00e9nua, Uini Atonio and Mathieu Bastareaud, among others, makes them tough noix to crack. In four games France have conceded only two tries and are vying with Ireland for the tightest defensive record in the competition. Taofif\u00e9nua and Atonio both weigh more than 20 stone, Maestri is almost 6ft 8in and over 19st, Flanquart is an inch taller and Bastaureaud\u2019s monstrous presence in midfield is well documented. Size is not everything in rugby but England are already braced for a full-on test of their credentials as one of the best packs in the world. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to go out there and expect to get pushed around,\u201d confirmed Lawes, who enjoyed a satisfyingly robust return to Test rugby against Scotland. \u201cWe\u2019re not the biggest pack but we are certainly physical. We like the contact and it\u2019s certainly going to be a big area of the game at the weekend. We\u2019ve got to make sure we bring our physicality and show them they can\u2019t just roll over us. Then hopefully we can get them moving around and maybe our fitness will tell, come the end.\u201d Lancaster is also waiting to see what his opposite number Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 chooses to do selection-wise, given France have a six-day turnaround between their final two Six Nations games. Their 29-0 win over Italy in Rome may cost them the services of the fly-half Camille Lopez, who limped off with a dead leg, and Jules Plisson, if fit, could yet start at 10. The No8, Louis Picamoles, is also back in contention after recovering from the thigh injury that has ruled him out of the tournament so far. \u201cWe won\u2019t be favourites, but we can win,\u201d Saint-Andr\u00e9 said. \u201cThere is very little difference between the teams in this tournament.\u201d England are merely contemplating the possibility of \u201cone or two tweaks\u201d, with Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling both pushing hard to start after impressing off the bench against Scotland. Lancaster is also weighing up the merits of including Alex Corbisiero in his matchday squad specifically to counter France\u2019s scrummaging strength but, despite Sam Burgess\u2019s presence at training in Bagshot, there is no chance of the latter making a surprise debut. The management also believes the recent stability in terms of selection \u2013 only 29 players have featured so far \u2013 has been among the factors behind England\u2019s rise to the top of the table after four rounds, along with a collective desire to win the title following three consecutive seasons as runners-up. \u201cIt would mean a huge amount for the players and the fans,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cI know how much hard work people have put in and how much it hurt to come second for three years in a row. But you can\u2019t start thinking about things like that until you get the detail of the game right. It could still be the case France have something to play for, so we won\u2019t start dreaming yet.\u201d He is also adamant England will not waste time sweating over permutations, concentrating instead on producing a display so good it delivers everything they want. \u201cPlaying last doesn\u2019t give you an advantage, it just gives you knowledge about what you need to do,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cThe emphasis will be on getting our performance right and taking opportunities when they\u2019re there. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to insulate the players from the result of the previous games because 82,000 people are shouting it at them when they run out on to the field. \u201cBut if you start chasing as many points as you can you\u2019ll undoubtedly become unstuck. Our priority is to win the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
