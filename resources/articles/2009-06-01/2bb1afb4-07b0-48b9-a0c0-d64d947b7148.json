South Africans have waited a dozen years for today's collision and Phil Vickery, Paul O'Connell and the visiting forwards coach, Warren Gatland, all feel a successful campaign would be the pinnacle of their careers. \"It would be the biggest thing I could be involved in if it were to happen,\" Vickery said, admitting he has never felt as nervous before a game. Even gnarled World Cup winners are struggling to keep a lid on their emotions. Often that means one thing: a banana skin is around the corner. At this stage before the 2005 series, Sir Clive Woodward was still urging people to jump on a plane at Heathrow to witness a historic Lions win over New Zealand. It did not turn out that way and it is perfectly possible that South Africa, the world champions, will trample underfoot the dreams of the thousands of travelling fans who have defied the credit crunch to be here If the Springboks were to coast to a 25-point win today, following a string of mostly half-baked provincial games, it would put the entire Lions concept under fresh scrutiny. Anyone who claims to know what will happen beside the Indian Ocean this afternoon, however, is either a liar or a clairvoyant. Even by the standards of past Lions tours, the form lines are extraordinarily blurred: South Africa have not played a proper Test since November and the Lions are always an unknown quantity. The referee, Bryce Lawrence, can be whistle-happy, and the likely warm weather should encourage both sides to go wide at some stage. In such circumstances, the ability to stay cool under pressure looks likely to be the critical factor. In that respect, if not everywhere else, the Lions might have an edge. Recent history has shown that South Africa can be rattled: the 2007 World Cup games against Tonga and Fiji and last year's tour matches in Scotland and Wales spring to mind. Gatland is also convinced, despite protestations to the contrary, that the home side will take time to adjust to the latest law revisions. \"We can take a lot of confidence out of France's performance against the All Blacks last week,\" the forwards coach said. \"Traditionally the first Test is an opportunity to catch the home team a little underdone. We've got to go in with some confidence and self-belief.\" Could we really be in for a repeat of the delirious scenes in Brisbane eight years ago, when magnificent tries by Jason Robinson and Brian O'Driscoll tore up most pre-match forecasts? Ruan Pienaar and Frans Steyn play their provincial rugby for the Sharks, but the familiar backdrop cannot camouflage their recent lack of game time. While Steyn's long-range boot may prove a factor, given Stephen Jones's relatively modest range, the Lions are more concerned about avoiding a slugfest with the home pack. \"If we got involved in a one-on-one confrontational battle, that's something the South Africans will enjoy,\" Gatland said . \"We have gone for mobility and hopefully we'll move their pack around and ask questions of their tight five.\" There are, to be fair, not many questions to which Bakkies Botha and Victor Matfield cannot supply short, sweet answers. But the referee's interpretations at scrum and breakdown will be scrutinised, with the Lions keen not to allow Heinrich Br\u00fcssow to be a persistent, ball-slowing menace. \"We're just looking for clarity and consistency,\" Gatland said. \"During the Super 14 there was less respect for the breakdown because the sanction was only a free-kick. We hope the referee is going to be strong in that area.\" Lawrence has told both sides he wants to see props scrummaging with heads and shoulders above waist height. This could work in the Lions' favour, Gatland believes, if Gethin Jenkins and Vickery make early inroads. \"If one of the scrums is dominant, and we hope it's going to be us, he should make sure he referees accordingly,\" Gatland said. If they can obtain quick ball, the Lions have the firepower to make it count. In the two tour games in which they fielded the majority of today's starting XV, they scored 15 tries and conceded one. The South African organisers yesterday urged home supporters to turn the 52,000-capacity stadium into \"a sea of green\", but they will struggle to dilute the crimson tide that has rolled into town. \"The hype has been bigger than before any other Test match I have played, and I have played in some big games,\" South Africa's captain, John Smit, said. It is precisely because of the screeching pressure on the Boks that the prowling Lions have a shot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
