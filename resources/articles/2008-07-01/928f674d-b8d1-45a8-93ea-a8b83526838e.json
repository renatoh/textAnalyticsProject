It's nigh on impossible to get your hands on a decent caprese salad north of Turin, so who better to divulge their black book of Italian trattorias and family-run pizzerias, from Siciliy to Genova, than Giorgio Locatelli and his team from Locanda Locatelli. We sent Elizabeth Day to Tuscany to talk Chianti and poodles with haute-designer-turned-vintner, Roberto Cavalli, at home in his vineyard, Il Poggio. Camp chat and macaws ensued and it appears Cavalli loves wine as much as women. Eva Wiseman went less far afield, spending a warm afternoon in north London chewing the fat with Michelin starred chef Angela Hartnett, formerly of The Connaught, and her familial entourage over lunch in the run up to the opening of Murano, the latest culinary outing from Gordon Ramsey. Gordon, however, wasn't invited. To celebrate the triumph of perhaps Italy's finest export, we've also got an eclectic range of super-simple pasta recipes from Anna Del Conte and Eric Treuille. Meanwhile our resident Italophile, Nigel Slater, has come up with a selection of fresh, simple and notably pasta-free Italian summer dishes. We'd like to know if you have any other chanced-upon culinary secrets to add to Locatelli's list. What do you like to grate on their penne other than parmiggiano? And what do you think of carb-free Italian summer dishes, a la Nigel Slater - a travesty or tremendous? Where are the best Italian eateries across the country? And is it even possible to muster up the guster to enthuse about Italy in the summer when a British one has clearly eluded us?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
