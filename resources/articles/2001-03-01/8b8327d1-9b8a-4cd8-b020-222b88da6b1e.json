The three-year exclusive agreement between Mr Beckham, his agents SFX and games publisher Rage is likely to be worth in excess of \u00a31m to the 26-year-old, who will receive royalties on each game sold plus an initial payment. The first units will go on sale in time for Christmas and will be a vital seller for the company, which yesterday announced an eight-fold increase in interim pretax losses. \"Through the association with David we believe we can create a long-term strong and global game franchise,\" said Paul Finnegan, managing director of Rage., whose development laboratories are based in Liverpool, above. Mr Beckham is likely to receive \u00a31 for every game sold. The announcement took the attention away from a disappointing set of results for the six months ending December 2000. The loss of \u00a37.9m and revenues of \u00a32.7m were in line with analyst's revised expectations following a series of profits warnings last year, however. Like many games companies, Rage is experiencing tough times. Shares closed down 1.5p at 5.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
