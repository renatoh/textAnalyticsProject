It is true that the sport enables the working masses to show a form of solidarity that can only by definition be expressed in segregated groups about a sport that is, in the final analysis, purely illusory. Taking all this into account, Eagleton misses one essential point about football though ... it's bloody great! Tim Matthews Luton, Bedfordshire \u2022 Simon Hattenstone's roll-call of literary goalkeepers (Who would be a goalkeeper? G2, 15 June) fails to mention Arthur Conan Doyle, who played in goal for Portsmouth Association Football Club (a predecessor of Portsmouth FC), in between practising as a GP in Southsea and trying his hand at scribbling short stories. Harry D Watson Edinburgh \u2022 Your article refers to \"the British public\" forgiving the error by Robert Green. This is another example of the interchangeability of the terms \"British\" and \"English\". The truth is that the Scots, in accordance with their \"anybody but England\" policy, would be even more ecstatic at this costly fumble than the most rabid of US soccer fans. David Pemberton Hulme, Cheshire \u2022 Simon Hattenstone's article reminded me of my 45 minutes as Maryhill primary school's goalkeeper. I was moved out from the goal after helping us to go 11-0 down to the local Catholic primary school by half-time, an important match for Glasgow schoolchildren in the 70s. Presumably I was unhappy out of the limelight once I was put in defence, so scored an own goal with a great header to help St Mary's win 21-0 in the end. The opprobrium Robert Green has endured is mild. Paul Climie Glasgow"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
