The drivers' already tense relationship deteriorated further last week after Hamilton criticised Alonso and the Spaniard was quick to respond in kind as it emerged his former team, Renault, would welcome him back. \"I'd be delighted if I didn't carry on with Hamilton,\" he said. \"If we are not together next season and I can go to a good car, then great. If we have to carry on together then we will have another great battle.\" Alonso has won the formula one title for the past two years but looks set to lose out this time to Hamilton, who is 12 points clear with two races remaining. The antipathy between the drivers is mutual. \"I'd much rather it were Fernando at Ferrari and me at McLaren,\" Hamilton said before his win in Japan on Sunday. Given the bad blood between the drivers, Hamilton's declaration that he sees a long-term future for himself at the team did little to calm matters. But Alonso denied speculation that he could take next season off and return to drive for Ferrari when his McLaren contract - which has a year to run with a one-year option - expires. \"It hasn't entered into my plans not to race next year,\" Alonso said. \"I don't have any news about Ferrari. They have a contract with Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa for next year, it's not a possibility that has entered into my thoughts for the coming year.\" Ferrari's Jean Todt has described as \"zero\" Alonso's chance of driving for the team next year. There were more welcoming noises from Renault. \"I told Fernando that the moment he is free from McLaren we would be pleased to have him back,\" the team's head, Flavio Briatore, said. He is convinced Alonso would not have joined McLaren if he had been aware he would receive the same treatment as Hamilton. Alonso's relationship with the McLaren team principal, Ron Dennis, has broken down. It reached a low when Alonso threatened to reveal evidence about the Ferrari spying row that led to McLaren being thrown out of the constructors' championship and fined \u00a350m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
