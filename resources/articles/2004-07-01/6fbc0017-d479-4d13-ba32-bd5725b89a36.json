While the gallant Tory knight, Peregrine Worsthorne, waxed lyrical about the romanticism of a system which commemorates a \"glorious period\" of national success, the Empire phase, the novelist JG Ballard (who turned down an honour) dismissed it as \"completely Ruritanian\" and something no writer should need. That sentiment must have produced a collective shudder from Grub St to the Hay-on-Wye Festival. But the largely sensible recommendations from Dr Tony Wright's committee will also disappoint republicans and other levellers who believe grown-up people do not need such baubles as OBEs or RVOs, let alone the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. Nowadays the GCMG goes mostly to diplomats (who refer to it as God Calls Me God), though it was origi nally intended to honour top locals in British-held Corfu and Malta. The committee rightly wants the GCMG and other anachronisms dumped, name-changing knighthoods and damehoods phased out, and all three classes of the Order of the British Empire to be rebranded: E for enduring Excellence, not for expired Empire. Some will quibble over an MBA-speak corporate word. Surely Order of Britain will do? Yes, but continuity matters, too. Existing CBEs, OBEs and MBEs are, mostly, highly deserving people who do good work. No reform of posh gongs can be complete until the fate of the Lords (Senate?) is resolved. But the Wright committee is also right to say that an open honours commission on the Australian model, its members and processes widely known, would also be an improvement. Rascally politicians who use honours to grease the system or fill the party coffers should be kept at bay. Nor should mere celebs be used to add \"stardust\" to a list. But humankind craves recognition. Honours are not inherently wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
