If Sam Mendes\u2019s big, punchy first world war epic was still on your to-see list when cinemas succumbed to lockdown in March, its digital release on Monday will come as a welcome quarantine care package. You will have missed an opportunity, though. Justly rewarded at the Oscars for Roger Deakins\u2019s propulsive, sleight-of-hand cinematography and its layered, pummelling sound design, 1917 remains involving and impressive in any format, but had more immediate sensory grandeur on the big screen. Setting aside the commotion over its smartly executed illusion of being shot in two long takes, Mendes\u2019s film is a man-on-a-mission tale in a simple, even classical vein, thinly characterised in ways that somewhat curtail its emotional impact. The technical showmanship here isn\u2019t mere window-dressing. It\u2019s what makes the film distinguished and immersive in the canon of films about the first world war \u2013 which rarely gets such elaborate cinematic treatment, at least relative to the ongoing parade of pyrotechnically enhanced second world war spectaculars. Perhaps it\u2019s the knowledge of all that deathly bravado to come, however, that gives an additional sense of piercing tragedy to the greatest first world war films \u2013 many of which are available to stream, if you feel like situating Mendes\u2019s blockbuster in context. Lewis Milestone\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front (BFI Player) is, astonishingly, 90 years old this year, and hasn\u2019t dated a whit, neither in its strikingly crisp, clean, unadorned film-making, nor in its tough, unsentimental perspective. It remains pretty much the master template for any anti-war film, its non-partisan depiction of daily life for German soldiers in the trenches as vividly harrowing in its way as Mendes\u2019s missive from the opposite side. That it deservedly won the best picture Oscar in 1930 is all the more remarkable when you consider that the same award went the year before to Wings (Amazon), a sweeping, silent action romance that seems largely enamoured of its WWI airman derring-do until its slightly ungainly \u201cwar kills\u201d coda. It\u2019s smashing, old-school entertainment, but hasn\u2019t aged nearly as gracefully. See also Howard Hughes\u2019s ludicrously glamorous planes-and-dames spectacle Hell\u2019s Angels (1930), available on the Internet Archive. It\u2019s not much of a history lesson, but it\u2019s a glistening romp. More stately decorum returned in A Farewell to Arms (Amazon Prime), a handsome, stirring 1932 adaptation of the Hemingway novel that accrues a genuine lump-in-throat gravity to its doomed romance between Gary Cooper\u2019s dashing ambulance officer and Helen Hayes\u2019s Red Cross nurse. Still, Hollywood depictions of the war veered ever more toward grandstanding and patriotism: see Howard Hawks\u2019s flawed but fascinating Sergeant York (Chili), a war-hero biopic caught between its subject\u2019s anti-war principles and conservative cheerleading that spoke very much to the moment in 1941. It would take the French to bring some cynicism to proceedings: Jean Renoir\u2019s peerless La Grande Illusion (1937), currently streaming on Mubi, still cuts deep with its humane, complex comedy, astutely threading class solidarity through opposing factions in its prisoner-of-war escape saga. After that, it wasn\u2019t until Stanley Kubrick\u2019s still-breathtaking Paths of Glory (1957; iTunes) that the Great War got a cast-iron classic film, with a portrayal of trench warfare as unflinching as its thorny examination of the moral consequences. In 1981, Gallipoli, Peter Weir\u2019s majestic, sun-scorched study (Amazon Prime) of Australian soldiers swallowed whole in the eponymous allied war campaign, brought a fresh national perspective to a genre dominated by American and European points of view. Recent decades have brought fewer essential first world war dramas, unless you count Steven Spielberg\u2019s claggy, custardy War Horse adaptation (2011), or a serviceable but standard-issue 2017 remake of that old chestnut Journey\u2019s End. Over both of those \u2013 indeed, over 1917 \u2013 it\u2019s James Kent\u2019s exquisite, underrated 2014 Vera Brittain biopic Testament of Youth (Amazon Prime) that I return to. A rare, bracing treasure for its foregrounding of female perspective in a tale of war, it has the soaring swirl and plunging sadness of the very best. More titles new to streaming this week The Beach Bum (Blue Finch, 18) Harmony Korine\u2019s first all-out stoner comedy never found a Spring Breakers-level following, but it\u2019s mellow and enveloping if you\u2019re in the mood, so to speak. If you\u2019re not, at least the ice-cream tones of Beno\u00eet Debie\u2019s cinematography make it a beautiful indulgence. Richard Jewell (Warner Bros, 15) The businesslike nature of Clint Eastwood\u2019s recent films works to the benefit of this gripping, dourly ambiguous biopic of the security guard caught up in the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing. The script wobbles, particularly on its gender politics, but Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates are superb. Water Lilies (Mubi, 15) With Portrait of a Lady on Fire having woken up a wider audience to C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s brilliance, the time is right for Mubi to stream her shimmering 2007 debut \u2013 long unavailable in any format \u2013 which demonstrated her sensual command of the female gaze early on. The Family Way (StudioCanal, 12) This re-release of the 1966 Britcom about newlyweds trapped under the same roof as the groom\u2019s family certainly makes for timely quarantine viewing. The film itself is a charming time capsule, no longer edgy but gently wry, buoyed by Paul McCartney\u2019s score."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
