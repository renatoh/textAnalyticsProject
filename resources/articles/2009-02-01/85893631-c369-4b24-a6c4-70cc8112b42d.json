The bank, which owns Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley branches in the UK, said a fundraising last year and strong profits from businesses in Spain, Latin America and Britain offset a rise in bad debts that led to \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.17bn) of writedowns for 2008. Abbey seized almost a third of the UK's shrinking mortgage market during the year as rivals curtailed lending. Net mortgage lending jumped 28% to \u00a311bn from \u00a38.7bn in 2007. Analysts said they bracketed Santander with HSBC as safe from the worst of the global downturn. Antonio Ramirez, of brokers Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said the Spanish regulatory system continued to insulate its banks from the worst of the economic downturn following restrictions on off-balance sheet debt vehicles and leveraged loans that were the downfall of many banks in the US and other European countries. He said the capital strength and decision to diversify from its home market, where it generates only 35% of its revenues, had also protected the bank. Santander raised more than \u20ac7bn in December to bolster its tier-one capital ratio, which now stands at 8.8%. Shares fell by a fifth, but it was deemed necessary by the chairman, Emilio Bot\u00edn. He buoyed up investors today when he ruled out further fundraising. \"With the ratios we have, we're not going to do it.\" However, Spanish industrial production fell by almost a fifth in December, tipping Spain deeper into recession. Fears that some Spanish banks will not survive the collapse in economic activity and over-inflated house prices have dogged Santander. A rise in company bankruptcies, up almost four times in the last quarter against the same period of 2007, increased fears of a rise in bad debts. Gloomy forecasts for the UK are also expected to dent prospects of growth in the bank's overseas market. Only Brazil and Latin American businesses were expected to grow during 2009. Abbey was able to capitalise on the woes of rival British banks last year following several years of conservative lending while it underwent reorganisation following its acquisition by Santander. Customer loans grew by 10% last year, and the bank sources 70% of funding from deposits. The bank said its net lending market share had rocketed from 8% to 30%. Overall Abbey said customer loans grew by 10% last year, supported by deposit growth of 16%, which means the company now sources more than 70% of its funding requirements from customer deposits. Anto Horta-Oso, Abbey's chief executive said: \"We are cautiously optimistic about our business prospects and are continuing to benefit from the strength of our parent company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
