Adelaide\u2019s Housing Legal Clinic is the latest service to bear the brunt of a funding squeeze, after the New South Wales Welfare Rights Centre said it feared for its future because of a $55,000 cut last month. The chair of SA\u2019s Welfare Rights Centre, Malcolm Downes, said the service would close on 30 June because the Liberal state government had not provided about $160,000 in future funding. \u201cWe reached a point where we needed to pull the plug to look after our clients, partners and our staff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tough decision.\u201d The outreach service offered legal advice and referrals to about 500 homeless and at-risk people a year, as well as representing people facing eviction at South Australia\u2019s civil and administrative tribunal. Downes said the previous Labor state government had also reduced its funding, and a \u201cwindback of federal funding\u201d had squeezed its budget further. The centre had provided free legal advice to Centrelink recipients until the earlier cuts. It has since survived on cash reserves, and the Housing Legal Clinic was its last service. Downes acknowledged the centre did not have \u201ca right to exist\u201d, but said its closure did not mean homelessness would go away. \u201cThere are 6,500 homeless people in South Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will probably add to that significantly. \u201cThe legal problems can be an unpaid fine. Those fines escalate and they either get a custodial sentence or they have to scrape together the money which means they get evicted. \u201cBeing out of stable accommodation is the tipping point.\u201d The SA human services minister, Michelle Lensink, told InDaily, which first reported the story, the government had stopped funding the centre because of \u201cperformance issues\u201d. \u201cOver several months, the SA Housing Authority has been actively engaged with the [centre] regarding long-standing concerns with the performance of their service,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we grant taxpayer-funded money to any organisation it is critically important we have certain performance criteria attached to that funding. \u201cUnfortunately [the centre] was unable to put forward proposals to address performance issues, and it was determined funding would cease.\u201d Downes acknowledged performances issues had been raised but said they were an \u201cexcuse\u201d for the government to meet efficiencies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
