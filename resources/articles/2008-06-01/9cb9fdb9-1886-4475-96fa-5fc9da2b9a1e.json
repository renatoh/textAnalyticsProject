Price \u00a38.99. Age 7-9 Maths is, according to this addition to Usborne's popular See Inside series, \"a way of finding out about the world\". With maths, \"you can count things, and measure things, and solve all kinds of problems\". The emphasis here is not on how to do it, but rather on the uses maths can be put to and the enjoyment to be found in playing with mathematical ideas. Across 10 double-page spreads, the book examines numbers and their history, simple mathematical functions, shapes, measurement and the basics of probability. Produced using sturdy cardboard pages, it poses a series of questions for readers to think about with explanations and solutions hidden under flaps. The focus is on applying maths to everyday functions - working out change when shopping, or using Pythagoras's theorem to calculate how long a ladder should be - and the full-colour pages are cheerfully illustrated with small figures busily engaged in a variety of activities. Final spreads add to the prevailing sense of fun with games that employ mathematical and logical skills. While the maths covered loosely corresponds to, and builds on, that learned in years 3 and 4, confident younger mathematicians will enjoy exploring the new ideas to be found here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
