In fact no serious economist claims to know the future with certainty and there are perfectly coherent analyses of the economy that suggest cutting interest rates further and faster, as you advocate, would be a mistake. But a bigger question is how you reconcile this with your enthusiasm for sustainable growth. The economy has enjoyed a consumer boom. Savings rates have been too low to make spending levels sustainable and so one must question the wisdom of measures designed to stimulate consumption. Perhaps, like many of the people you criticise, you want sustainability, but not just yet.
