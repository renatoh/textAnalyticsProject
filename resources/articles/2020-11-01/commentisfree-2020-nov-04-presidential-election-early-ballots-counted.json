This, of course, is not a surprise. Many experts, election officials and journalists have anticipated precisely such an outcome, and have sought to counsel patience. An election, after all, is not a day but a process, and the process is not complete until all votes have been counted. If we are unaccustomed to having to wait for the results, we are also unaccustomed to voting in a time of pandemic. The fact that we don\u2019t yet know who our next president will be is not evidence of a system malfunctioning; to the contrary. It is proof that election officials around the country are taking the requisite time to make sure that all ballots \u2013 including all those cast by mail \u2013 are properly tallied. Counting early ballots \u2013 and some 100 million Americans cast their vote before election day \u2013 is labor intensive. Envelopes often need to be hand-opened; signatures need to be checked against those in-state records; and election officials will have to perform these acts while practicing safe-distancing. Some states, such as Colorado, have been counting mail-in ballots since they arrived; others, such as several counties in Pennsylvania, will only begin the task after election day. So patience is the order of the day. The integrity of the electoral system demands no less. Alas, this commonsensical message appears to have been lost on the president himself, who early Wednesday morning recklessly declared, \u201cFrankly, we did win this election.\u201d At a campaign rally in the key swing state of Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump direly predicted that if election day passes without a clear winner, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have bedlam in our country.\u201d Such fearmongering is nothing new for the president. More troubling was the opinion penned last week by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, supporting the US supreme court\u2019s refusal to extend the date for the receipt of mail-in ballots in Wisconsin. In a sloppy concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh averred to the state\u2019s interest in avoiding \u201cthe chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election\u201d. States, he added, \u201cwant to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter\u201d. In warning of \u201cchaos and suspicions of impropriety\u201d, Kavanaugh appears to be simply repeating, in modified language, Trump\u2019s baseless attacks on mail-in voting, amplified early Wednesday when Trump falsely declared that the continued count of mail-ins constitutes a \u201cmajor fraud in our nation\u201d. On the same day that the court issued its opinion, the president tweeted: \u201cBig problems and discrepancies with Mail in Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3.\u201d Twitter marked this post with the warning, \u201cSome or all of the content shared in this tweet \u2026 might be misleading.\u201d Unfortunately, Twitter was not able to issue a similar warning about Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion. And so while we might hope that the call for patience might rise above partisanship, Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion reminds us that patience too has its politics. A couple of years ago, election law expert Ned Foley coined the term \u201cblue shift\u201d to describe the fact that mail-in and provisional ballots tend to break for Democratic candidates. For example, in the 2018 Arizona senatorial race, Martha McSally, the Republican candidate, enjoyed a 15,000-vote lead over her Democratic rival, Kyrsten Sinema, on election day. But by the time the state completed its count of mail-in and provisional votes McSally found herself defeated by Sinema by some 56,000 votes. Trump and Kavanaugh are not the first to raise suspicions about blue shift. In 2018, the former House speaker Paul Ryan groused about several Republican losses in California congressional races: \u201cWe had lots of wins that night [ie, on election night], and three weeks later we lost basically every contested California race.\u201d The losses, Ryan insisted, were \u201cbizarre\u201d. But there is nothing bizarre about the fact that in this election, more than twice as many Democrats \u2013 who have expressed greater concern about the health risks of in-person balloting \u2013 as Republicans have chosen to vote by mail. Indeed, if this weren\u2019t an established fact, then Trump\u2019s unrelenting attack on the integrity of voting by mail would be unintelligible \u2013 if not foolhardy. Of course, the president might be correct in predicting bedlam \u2013 especially if he works overtime to cause it. The last four years have demonstrated Trump\u2019s power to sow chaos, discord and division; and if the president believes that triggering unrest will serve to muddy the count of mail-in ballots, he will certainly not shy away from doing so. Here we can share the hope that we will quickly enough know the winner. But should the count take time, we must practice precisely what the president and his minions insist we can ill-afford \u2013 patience.
