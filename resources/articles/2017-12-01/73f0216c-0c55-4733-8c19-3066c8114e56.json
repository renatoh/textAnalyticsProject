The former British prime minister also accused Russia of winning the right to stage the 2018 Fifa World Cup via corruption. Giving his first British public lecture since his resignation in the wake of the Brexit referendum defeat in 2016, Cameron also defended multilateral institutions such as the European Union, warning isolationism driven by anti-globalisation endangered the world\u2019s security. Giving a lecture in London to Transparency International, he said: \u201cJust as with all our biggest challenges \u2013 on trade, on terrorism, on climate change, on global poverty \u2013 we need to work with other nations if we want change. We cannot do this alone.\u201d Cameron warned that Trump\u2019s attacks on news organisations such as CNN and the BBC were not just tactically wrong but dangerous. He accused the US president of \u201can attempt to question the whole legitimacy of organisations that have an important role in our democracy\u201d. Cameron said: \u201cLet me put it like this: President Trump, \u2018fake news\u2019 is not broadcasters criticising you, it\u2019s Russian bots and trolls targeting your democracy pumping out untrue stories day after day, night after night. \u201cWhen you misappropriate the term \u2018fake news\u2019, you are deflecting attention from real abuses. Ignoring what\u2019s happening on social media is facilitating a form of corruption that is undermining democracy.\u201d He then directly challenged the way in which Russia won the right to stage the 2018 World Cup describing the event as a fiasco. \u201cPresident Putin actually boycotted the whole thing because he said it was riddled with corruption,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe was right \u2013 it was.\u201d Adding he was putting it as diplomatically as he could, he said: \u201cI am sure he wasn\u2019t completely surprised when Russia actually won the bid. You couldn\u2019t make it up. In the years since, 10 of the 22 members of that Fifa executive committee were indicted or punished.\u201d Cameron made the global fight against corruption one of the themes of his premiership, and it was the major issue of his chairmanship of the G8 in 2015. He also staged a corruption summit in 2016 at which world leaders made a series of pledges to clamp down on money laundering and kleptocracy. In his lecture he defended his record as premier, saying he persuaded British Overseas Territories, often seen as tax havens, to set up central registers of beneficial ownership that were open to law enforcement agencies. In the UK he introduced a public register on beneficial ownership. But legislation promised by Cameron in 2015 on a public register of foreign companies owning property in the UK or seeking public sector contracts has been delayed, with the government promising this week to introduce a draft law in this parliamentary session. Overall, No 10 has not given the impression of wanting to give global leadership on the issue and Cameron pointedly referred to his corruption summit as the high water mark of UK government action. He warned that the fight against corruption needed international cooperation and institutions to succeed. Returning to some of the themes that lost him his premiership, he insisted: \u201cI am not some starry-eyed Davos-devotee who thinks there is nothing wrong with globalisation. Of course we need to help those left behind economically, with better skills, more apprenticeships and higher minimum wages. And we cannot ignore those who feel left behind culturally; whether by immigration that has been too high, or by international organisations \u2013 yes, including the European Union \u2013 that have been too high handed.\u201d But he urged: \u201cDon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater, including market economics, institutions with rules and openness to the world. These are things that make us strong. \u201cThe things the wave of anti-globalisation is in danger of ushering in \u2013 isolationism, protectionism, unilateralism \u2013 endanger our countries and our world. And they particularly threaten the fight against corruption. \u201cThe cancer of corruption is developing, metastasising and becoming more commonplace, more complex, more multi-layered, elusive and ingrained,\u201d he said, adding that the best antidote was \u201ctransparency, real democracy and accountability\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
