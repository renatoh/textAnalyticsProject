The charge set at 8% would raise \u00a31bn a year and remain in force until the mandate to eliminate the current deficit is met. The levy would remove the reductions in corporation tax on the banks since 2010 and would be additional to the existing bank levy. The proposal will be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto for May\u2019s general election if \u2013 as looks likely \u2013 the chancellor, George Osborne, is not persuaded to include it in the final budget of the parliament later this month. Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems are committed to a further \u00a330bn of fiscal \u201cconsolidation\u201d in the new parliament to clear the deficit in the public finances by 2017-18. But unlike the Tories \u2013 who say they would do it through a combination of spending and welfare cuts and a further clampdown of tax avoidance \u2013 the Lib Dems say they would seek to raise at least \u00a38bn through additional taxes. Alexander said the banks had recovered sufficiently to make a contribution to deficit reduction on top of the existing bank levy. \u201cFailings in the banking system were a major factor in the great crash of 2008. That is why we have always insisted that the banks help fund repairing the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo that end, we introduced the bank levy, which is on track to raise \u00a38bn in this parliament. With the final stage of deficit reduction requiring around \u00a330bn of savings, it would be totally wrong for all of that to be found from cuts to public services as the Conservatives propose.\u201d Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cNobody will trust what the Lib Dems say after they broke their promises on tax by raising VAT on families while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. \u201cLabour will introduce a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people. We\u2019ll reverse this government\u2019s \u00a33bn-a-year tax cut for the top 1% of earners to help get the deficit down fairly.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
