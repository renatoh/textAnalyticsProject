Les Bleus have been playing like a collection of Clouseaus and Monsieur Hulots, one scrape following another, but if they beat Ireland next Saturday and by a sufficient margin, they will sit above the rest, although they will not be alone in wondering how they got there. It is an unlikely outcome, not least because their points difference is relatively poor, but the fact it is a possibility is a wonder. France's lineout on Saturday was shambolic at the start and deteriorated. Their scrum, steady at first, crumpled like the turf, and had Scotland won it would have been because of the penalties they generated from the set-piece in the second-half, their ball protection in contact was lamentable and they made a series of egregious errors: kicks were charged down, passes and kicks were dropped, try-scoring opportunities were squandered and their lack of clarity was exposed at the end when Jean-Marc Doussain lined up the kick to put them back in front. There were some 100 seconds to go when he called for the tee for a kick that was virtually in front of the posts. He was expected to dawdle and use the maximum amount of time allowed so that when Scotland restarted all France had to do was secure the ball and kick it dead to claim victory. Instead, he hurried, as if his team needed to score again to win, fortunate that the home side did not manage to reclaim possession with more than a minute remaining. France's head coach, Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, when asked afterwards if he felt Ireland were the best team in the tournament, replied that the question would be answered this weekend. \"I hope the Brian O'Driscoll party was in Dublin last Saturday and not this week at the Stade de France,\" he said before pointing out, not unfairly, that while his team had struggled at times in all four of their matches, their record of three wins and one defeat was considerably better than at this stage a year ago when three losses were supplemented by a draw. \"We have shown great mental strength,\" he said. \"We were clinging on at times, but the players believed. It was the sort of game you remember only for the result and we would have probably lost a year ago.\" In the first 10 minutes it seemed France would not only win but inflate their points difference, clearly stung into a response after the capitulation in Cardiff the previous round: they were six points up through two Maxime Machenaud penalties, Mathieu Bastareaud was bouncing off tacklers and one counterattack recaptured the France of old with its mix of adventure and skill. Instead of taking a grip on the game, they conceded a soft try to Stuart Hogg and confidence turned to diffidence. \"We were afraid to try things,\" said Machenaud, whose poor clearance kick was the foundation for Hogg's score. \"We cannot be satisfied with the performance and our attacking game reflected a lack of confidence. People are right to criticise us, but we kept going until the end. We know it will be much more difficult against Ireland and we have a lot of things to put right, but there is no such thing as a bad win.\" It was a bad defeat, though, for a Scotland team unrecognisable from their last home match the previous month when they were passive in defeat by England. They overcame the early loss of John Beattie to hold sway at the breakdown; Jim Hamilton dominated the lineout where the France hooker Brice Mach had an uncanny knack of finding an opponent; Geoff Cross became a key figure in the scrum; and Matt Scott has the guile in the midfield they have long been searching. For the last 70 minutes they looked in control, but like France they have a capacity for giving opponents a break. The try they conceded came from a long Duncan Weir pass that was caught by Yoann Huget on his own 22. \"I could see we were outnumbered defensively and took a chance,\" said the wing, who opened the tournament with two tries against England. Scotland are not used to winning, as they showed in the final minutes first by wasting position in France's half and then by giving away a penalty under the posts. They have beaten Les Bleus only once in 15 years and their record against the team they face on Saturday, Wales, is little better, one success since 2003. \"I think it is fair to say we will not be the favourites in Cardiff and that will allow us to express ourselves,\" Hogg said. \"We are more than capable of winning there. Losing at the very end of a game the boys up front had done so well in was hard to take, but we are going in the right direction and we have the structures in place to succeed.\" France are succeeding despite having a structure all too prone to collapse and they have lost to Ireland only four times in the postwar period, twice since 1952. \"It is a roller-coaster ride with us,\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 said. \"Everything is not perfect, but we have already won more matches than we did in 2013. The more you win, the less you fear.\" Scotland Hogg; Seymour, Dunbar, Scott, Lamont (Evans, 30); Weir, Laidlaw; Grant, S Lawson (Ford, 51), Cross, Gray, Hamilton (Swinson, 68), Beattie (Wilson, 16), Brown (capt), Denton.
