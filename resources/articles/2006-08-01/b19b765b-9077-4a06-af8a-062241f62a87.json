Research commissioned from 12 European sports economics experts suggests the victorious club will earn huge additional revenue from television income, sponsorship and the benefits of an enhanced international profile. Sponsorship is likely to be the biggest source of financial gain, worth up to \u00a334m to the winning club, according to the study published yesterday. The experts, drawn from England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Croatia, suggest victory could increase sponsorship revenue by 400%. The study also projects merchandising could increase by up to 100%, that an improved international image could earn the club up to \u00a313.5m and the value of players could increase between 10% and 30%. Clubs could also expect to earn additional TV revenue from rights in the run-up to the final and in the domestic league and international cup competitions in the following season. The report, commissioned by MasterCard, one of the Champions League sponsors, says: \"Significant benefits are also realised from prize money, an increase in attendance at games, an increased fan base [due to higher recognition and prestige], an increase in hospitality income, and an increase in sponsorship and advertising income. There may also be a knock-on effect that leads to the value of the players increasing, and the club having more influence in the leagues.\" The \u00a367m victory bounty is put into perspective, the study concludes, by the fact that it is less than the majority of the UK's top clubs have spent on transfers and wages in the past season. The findings, however, do suggest hidden rewards of victory in the tournament beyond the guaranteed revenue figures published by Uefa. Last season's winners, Barcelona, received guaranteed income from performance and starting bonuses, point bonusesand television market share of \u00a321.3m. The figure included \u00a34.3m for victory against Arsenal in the final in Paris. As runners-up, the north London club received slightly more, based on the same bonus system, of \u00a323.5m, including \u00a32.6m for participating in the final. The research also calculated the benefit of a Champions League victory to the winning city of about \u00a323.7m on average. The experts say Liverpool benefited by \u00a347.4m after victory in 2005, while Porto benefited by \u00a38.1m a year earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
