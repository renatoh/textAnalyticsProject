Napoli and RB Salzburg played out a 1-1 draw tonight and Liverpool can qualify for the last 16 when they take on the Serie A side later this month. The mood in the Liverpool is understandably feelgood but James Milner knows they were not at their peak best. \u201cI thought we were good at times and a bit sloppy at others, but the workload has been massive at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just pleased to get the result. Set pieces are always going to be dangerous and when you have six changes one of the hardest things bits to pick up is team shape and people doing different jobs to what they normally do. It\u2019s something to look at and improve on.\u201d Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with a whacking ice pack on the ankle, says: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting better with every game physically but I think there\u2019s more to come from me. It\u2019s nice to be chipping in with the odd goal as well. Job done. 90 min: Liverpool have three minutes to extend their lead/hang on. 89 min: Origi lashes one wide, and that\u2019s his final contribution. He gets a hearty reception \u2013 another decent shift \u2013 and on comes Bobby Firmino. 88 min: Onuachu has been lively since coming on. Genk try to float the ball into him to attack but Alisson gathers. Firmino is about to enter for Liverpool. 87 min: Salah, almost! The Liverpool forward is slipped in a treat but after a marvellous show of strength, he overplays a little and is eventually crowded out. Meanwhile Genk are not going down without a fight ... 86 min: Onuachu and Bongonda replace De Norre and Hrosovsky. 85 min: \u201cHi Ben, watching Liverpool struggle to kill off Genk while reading about the 4-4 down the (long-ish) road has me thinking we\u2019re watching the wrong game, a bit like watching Liverpool do away with Porto while City and Spurs traded four goals in seven minutes last year,\u201d emails Bobby Moore. Me too. 82 min: A raging Casper De Norre is booked for dissent after Joe Gomez buys a cheap foul out of Dieumerci Ndongala. 81 min: Genk almost level! De Norre dinks a wonderful ball into Heynen, who chests the ball down, swivels inside the box and rattles an effort goalwards. He had the freedom of Liverpool as he turned and wellied the ball at goal but Alisson does well to get down low to his left. Klopp and co have been warned. 80 min: Origi makes a crude challenge on Dewaest. The striker tries to jump out of the way of the Genk midfielder but crashes into him instead. 78 min: Liverpool are not trying too hard for a third and Genk are not trying hard enough to dig out an equaliser. At Stamford Bridge, chaos and a good old fashioned nine-goal thriller: 74 min: Robertson replaces Ke\u00efta and a standing ovation from the Kop as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is withdrawn. On comes Man\u00e9. 73 min: Not a lot is happening, so here\u2019s a killer stat, courtesy of Opta: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored four goals in his last four games for Liverpool; as many as in his previous 45 appearances for the club. 70 min: Liverpool are knocking the ball about for fun. They\u2019re enjoying themselves \u2013 but could do with a third. Will Klopp add Man\u00e9 or Firmino into the mix? He must be tempted. 69 min: Andy Robertson is getting stripped to come on. 68 min: Genk\u2019s Dieumerci Ndongala replaces Ito. 67 min: Salah kills the ball with a wonderful first touch and tries to pick out Milner roaming down the left but Genk cut it out. 65 min: Alexander-Arnold sends a piledriver sailing over the bar with his left foot. Liverpool are certainly trying to hunt down a third goal. 64 min: Genk have stuck at their task, as did Slavia Prague: 62 min: Liverpool win a corner after another exquisite move. Salah dummied the ball for Wijnaldum, who struck at goal with the outside of his boot. The corner comes to nothing and Ito breaks forward for Genk but he blasts the ball into Row ZZ. 60 min: Dewaest heads a Heynen free-kick straight at Alisson. The Genk defender appeared offside anyway. Meanwhile, Chelsea are getting thumped: 58 min: Salah does absolutely everything \u2013 but finish! The Egyptian does superbly to brush off a robust challenge from his marker before allowing the ball to run into his path. He drives into a yard of space, drifting on to his left foot but, in the end, it\u2019s a powder-puff strike. An anticlimax after another incisive Liverpool break. 55 min: Another stunning Liverpool move, with Origi nonchalantly flicking the ball into Wijnaldum, who almost supplies Salah. \u201cWe are the champions, champions of Europe!\u201d comes the chant. Normal service resumed at Anfield. Superb, smarting finish. Salah does well to keep his marker at arm\u2019s length before Oxlade-Chamberlain takes over the baton and swivels before smashing one into the bottom corner from 20 yards out at the Kop end. Sublime strike. 51 min: Close! Another great move by Genk culminates in Trent Alexander-Arnold diving in to steal the ball away and clear Liverpool\u2019s lines. Heynen surged forward into acres of space behind the defence before pinging a ball across goal. The assistant referee raises his flag, presumably for offside but replays show the midfielder was miles on. Nothing new there. 49 min: Origi tries his luck from 25 yards! It is curling into the far corner but Coucke gets a strong left hand down to it and smothers the ball. It was bending in and the Genk goalkeeper had to act. He made a bit of a meal of it, but got there in the end. 48 min: A flat start to the second half. Klopp\u2019s not having this. He orders Man\u00e9, Firmino and, er, Lovren out to warm up. 46 min: Liverpool get us back under way at Anfield. Pep Guardiola doesn\u2019t think Man\u00e9 is naughty after all: Half-time news bulletin: Van Dijk flicks a header just wide as the referee blows his whistle. Lucum\u00ed had conceded a corner, which Alexander-Arnold recycled on the edge of the box, lashing at goal. Van Dijk connected with it but his header drops just wide. And with that the players head down the tunnel. Liverpool were in cruise control but in the end they did not have things all their own way. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: Origi drags wide! The striker should have done better. He smashes the ball wide of a post after being played in by Fabinho, who made a heavy challenge on a Genk defender to steal the ball away before nudging it into the path of Origi. 43 min: What\u2019s Samatta with Liverpool? Genk bare their teeth as Joe Gomez drops off Heynen, allowing the Genk midfielder to send a stinging shot just wide of Alisson\u2019s right post. Liverpool have gone to sleep the past five minutes. What a header! Mbwana Samatta flies to the front post and powers home a corner to punish Liverpool, who totally switched off. In truth it was a mad minute or so for Liverpool, who allowed Genk to whip an initial cross in from the right, which Alexander-Arnold got a crucial touch on to intervene to take the ball away from Samatta, conceding a corner in the process. But then Liverpool allowed Samatta a second bite of the cherry and the Tanzanian unmistakably finished. 37 min: Ke\u00efta drags wide! It stems from another Alexander-Arnold corner, which is fired into van Dijk, who is lurking off centre. But the Dutch defender swipes thin air. Liverpool work it to Ke\u00efta, as Genk\u2019s defence go missing but the midfielder\u2019s shot is off target. Moments later Salah is in on goal but the Slovakian referee pulls up the forward for a foul on Dewaest. 35 min: Liverpool go close! Another sumptuous ball in from the left by \u2013 you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 Milner and Salah fires just wide! He latched on to the pass and tried to drive the ball into the corner but he could not squeeze it inside the far post. Liverpool have mustered 11 attempts on goal. Genk? Just the none. 34 min: Ke\u00efta surges forward but runs into a roadblock. Meanwhile Oxlade-Chamberlain goes to ground after taking a wholehearted whack. He seems to have twisted or rolled his ankle. But the Liverpool midfielder is soon back up on his feet. He\u2019s trying to run it off. Nothing to see here? 30 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain twists and turns just inside the box, as if he is skiing down the slopes \u2013 he works a wonderful opening \u2013 but Genk make a last-ditch block. A second goal is coming. Liverpool fans can feel it, smell it. 29 min: James Milner is verging on unplayable down the left. The makeshift defender piles forward down the left and whips in another cross, this time to no avail. Liverpool are enjoying themselves and Genk, too. The visitors are under the cosh but are no longer happy to merely shut up shop. 28 min: Genk get away with one as the goalkeeper Coucke makes a mess of a routine clearance. Luckily for him, De Norre is in close proximity and able to hoover up the danger with Salah lurking. Liverpool supporters promptly drown Anfield in the sweet sound of Si Se\u00f1or, an infectious ode to Roberto Firmino. 26 min: Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Origi combine \u2013 but the latter is flagged offside. It is another electric move down the left. There is so much going on, so much for Genk to handle. 23 min: Dewaest hacks it clear, Genk surge forward but then they gift it straight back to Liverpool, who break through Oxlade-Chamberlain. Then Ke\u00efta is in down the left, with the midfielder forcing a save out of Coucke in the Genk goal. This game is beginning to ebb and flow, with Genk coming out of their shells. 22 min: Jhon Lucum\u00ed is booked for pulling, tugging and just about everything else at Mo Salah\u2019s shirt. The Genk defence is already strained. Salah and Alexander-Arnold are stood over the free-kick, on the edge of the box. Twenty yards out ... 20 min: Naby Ke\u00efta nicks the ball away from Ito, just as it seems the Genk striker is winding up for an ambitious shot, a good 35 yards from goal. Then Liverpool pound forward down the other end and Milner sends a snapshot wide. 18 min: It\u2019s going to be a long night for the Genk defence. Salah almost races in behind the visitors\u2019 back line \u2013 but the flag goes up. 16 min: That was all rather easy for Liverpool. A simple move down the left, after neat interplay and a triangle or two. And then a teasing cross into the box is not dealt with and Wijnaldum fires home instinctively. Ke\u00efta, Milner and Origi combine down the left flank and, when Milner delivers approaching the byline, the Genk defence panics and they duly fail to clear their lines. There is Georginio Wijnaldum, who applies a deft, hooked finish. 12 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain is pickpocketed on halfway after Ke\u00efta found the midfielder. It was patient buildup play, with Alexander-Arnold cannoning a pass into Ke\u00efta, who wriggled away from a couple of white shirts before the move broke down. Genk pour forward on the counter but nothing comes of it. 11 min: Salzburg lead Napoli. Erling Braut Haaland, of course. 9 min: Another corner. Another Alexander-Arnold training-ground routine, with the full-back playing the ball into Virgil van Dijk, who peels off his man into shed loads of space. Van Dijk hooks it towards goal but it\u2019s wayward. 8 min: It\u2019s taken preposterously quick, but Salah cannot connect properly with the pass. Liverpool, who are dominating possession, will go again. 7 min: Alexander-Arnold wins a corner ... 5 min: Van Dijk plays a flawless 40-yard diagonal into James Milner, who finds Naby Ke\u00efta. Nice little move but Liverpool cannot get a clear shot away. They recycle the ball down the right, with Wijnaldum driving into plenty of space down the right. Origi is in the middle but the midfielder failed to pick him out. 3 min: De Norre tries and fails to dink the ball over the top to Ito. 1 min: Divock Origi, who joined Genk aged six before later joining Lille, surges down the left. Then Wijnaldum goes on the rampage. Liverpool begin with plenty of intent. Genk get things started. The teams trudge out of the tunnel at Anfield. It\u2019s time. Beat this for a Genk/Gent tale. \u201cWhilst I was in charge of Liverpool Hope University\u2019s outdoor activity centre in North Wales, one enterprising student who had missed the coach to take him to his week-long residential course near Barmouth, decided to catch the train from Liverpool instead,\u201d begins Graham Moger on email. \u201c\u2018Well done, lad\u2019, we thought and said we\u2019d pick him up from the nearby station. Sadly, he caught the train to Bournemouth instead of Barmouth. He was studying Geography.\u201d Well, well, well ... \u201cI can see Liverpool lining up 4-2-3-1,\u201d emails Joe Shelton. \u201cFabinho and Gini the two, Ox, Ke\u00efta and Salah behind Origi?\u201d Quite possibly \u2013 there\u2019s only one way to find out. And Klopp reckons Genk could make life difficult by shoving five defenders, and possibly a few more, behind the ball. \u201cIt looks a little bit like they could play five at the back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be the first time in ages but it is still possible. There is always some space in between the lines, we have to find that and make the pitch wide. We have to be strong, quick and direct.\u201d Klopp speaks, and says he is confident his captain, Jordan Henderson, will be fit for Sunday\u2019s showdown with Manchester City despite not training because of illness on Monday. Henderson is absent this evening. \u201cHe wanted to make himself available but we said \u2018go home again, you are whiter than a sheet\u2019 so from tomorrow I think he will be fine,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cWe have to be really careful, because we don\u2019t want all of them [to be ill].\u201d Of those six changes, he adds: \u201cIt is to bring in fresh legs, fresh ideas, new skills and different ways to play. We never know what the other team is going to do to us. We didn\u2019t meet in the car park before the game, we trained a couple of times together and, yeah, let\u2019s play a football game. I said today in a meeting it looks like for two-and-half years every game is the most important in our life and this is again like this, a very important game and we want to show that on the pitch.\u201d Regarding that Genk/Gent mix-up, and the possibility of a handful of Belgians following suit in search of Anfield, a tweet. \u201cYou\u2019ve overlooked Liverpool Nova Scotia, which is also on the Mersey River,\u201d says Steven Kempton. \u201cA few have shown up in Sydney (Cape Breton) looking for the Opera House only to find a large fiddle.\u201d And an email courtesy of Shane O\u2019Leary: \u201cI find it easy to respect and admire Pep, but impossible to connect in the same gut reaction way that I do with Der Kloppster. Pep gives the impression that he approaches making toast in the same way while Der Kloppster seems to be a more visceral, jumpers for goalposts and toast with a flamethrower kind of guy. Am I right?\u201d Alisson speaks, and says others raise seem to raise their game against Liverpool. \u201cEveryone looks at us as the champions so when we go to the pitch, everyone wants to beat us,\u201d he says. \u201cI always have a big expectation on me all my life, so all of my life I have dealt with that. I just need to show my best on the pitch for my supporters and the team to achieve big things. I think I did really good last season and I want to do that again and, if possible, even better. We gave everything on the pitch last season and will try to do that again. Why not?\u201d Obviously we are only thinking about Genk \u2013 but Pep Guardiola did stoke a fire with those comments about Man\u00e9 and diving. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s riposte? To touch on Manchester City\u2019s tactical fouls and defend his man, of course. \u201cI don\u2019t understand these types of things,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cMy brain is not big enough to think about another team as well. I have enough to do to think about us.\u201d From Paris to Berlin Birmingham to Qatar: Team news news: J\u00fcrgen Klopp makes six changes, with James Milner filling in at left-back in the absence of Andy Robertson, who is given a breather ahead of the big one on Sunday. The Scot is on the bench, alongside Sadio Man\u00e9 and Roberto Firmino, though Klopp will hope he does not have to call on any of the trio. Divock Origi gets the nod up front and Fabinho in midfield, while Oxlade-Chamberlain will play out wide and Gomez replaces Lovren. Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, van Dijk, Gomez, Milner; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Ke\u00efta; Salah, Origi, Oxlade-Chamberlain Subs: Adri\u00e1n, Lovren, Robertson, Lallana, Jones, Man\u00e9, Firmino Genk (4-4-2): Coucke; Maehle, De Norre, Lucum\u00ed, Cuesta; Heynen, Hrosovsky, Dewaest, Berge; Ito, Samatta Subs: Wouters, Onuachu, Piotrowski, Hagi, Vandevoordt, Bongonda, Ndongala Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (Slovakia) Hopefully no Genk supporters have rocked up in Illinois or New South Wales expecting to watch their team turn over J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side at Anfield. Two Liverpool supporters missed their 4-1 victory in Belgium last month after travelling to Gent, 80 miles away from Genk, by mistake. Surely not. Anyway, this is the easy bit for Klopp. Hours after Liverpool confirmed they will play twice in two days next month \u2013 presumably Klopp will not be in both Birmingham and then Qatar for the Carabao Cup and Fifa Club World Cup respectively \u2013 it is back to the day job and a competition they truly cherish. Their Premier League showdown against Manchester City is not until Sunday but first they have the chance to brush aside Genk. Fabinho could return after skipping Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win at Aston Villa, while Klopp could start James Milner and hand Jordan Henderson a breather. Napoli top Group E and will qualify for the last 16 if they beat Red Bull Salzburg and Genk fail to win at Anfield. There seems a good chance of that, with Liverpool in no mood to surrender with City on the horizon and Genk having conceded five goals in each of their past three Champions League away games. Klopp could not help but indulge in Sadio Man\u00e9 talk and tactical-foul chat in the buildup to this one, though his players know the drill. \u201cThe story the boys wrote in the past three years was only possible because we were always focused on the next game,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe have bigger ambitions in this competition than Tuesday night so we have to be 100% spot on. I don\u2019t doubt my players at all. I would feel a bit embarrassed if I had to tell them \u2018don\u2019t think about Man City already.\u2019\u201d Think about Gent Genk. Kick-off: 8pm (GMT)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
