Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the late Sean Connery assisted him in getting planning applications passed in Scotland fell apart quickly on Sunday when the chair of the planning committee said the James Bond star was not involved. In a series of tweets, two days prior to the US election, Trump paid tribute to Connery, saying he was \u201chighly regarded and respected in Scotland and beyond\u201d. It was announced on Saturday the James Bond actor had died aged 90. But his claim that Connery stepped in and shouted \u201clet him build the damn thing\u201d in connection with a big development raised eyebrows in Scotland. He tweeted that \u201ceverything went swimmingly\u201d with his development plans after initially \u201chaving a very hard time getting approvals\u201d. In 2008 Connery is reported as saying of the project: \u201cDuring tough economic times, this is a major vote of confidence in Scotland\u2019s tourist industry and our ability to rise to the challenge. I look forward to seeing a new gem in the north-east that is good for Aberdeenshire and good for Scotland.\u201d But Martin Ford, the Aberdeenshire councillor who was chair of the planning committee that initially refused Trump\u2019s application to build the resort, told the Guardian: \u201cMr Connery was not involved in the due process that led to the granting of planning permission for a golf resort at Menie. He did not submit a letter of representation to the council, appear at the planning hearing, or at the public local inquiry.\u201d Ford added: \u201cOpinions offered in press articles are not material considerations in decisions on planning applications.\u201d Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said: \u201cScotland and much of the world is mourning the loss of a great spirit. Sean Connery\u2019s contribution and life\u2019s work was immense, real and lasting and everyone with an ounce of class is reflecting upon just that today. Tributes are great from all sources but this is not a time for tweeting silly claims or indeed responding to them.\u201d David Milne, a near neighbour of the Trump golf course in Scotland, and the US president\u2019s most vocal local critic, said the claim that Connery helped him land planning permission for his golf resort was \u201cutter bollocks\u201d. Milne said Connery had never played the course, despite Trump\u2019s invites. The actor was offered the honour of becoming the first member of Trump\u2019s golf resort at Menie, north of Aberdeen, with membership number 007, which the property mogul built after bulldozing a very rare dune habitat as well as overriding local planning rules. Trump had said that he wanted the star to play the first shot on the course. But when the resort was opened two years later, Trump played first balls with former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie instead. The pair did know each other, however. Connery and Trump were photographed together at several events in New York, including the Johnnie Walker Dressed to Kilt fashion show in the early 2000s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
