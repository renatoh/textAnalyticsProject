The fire, the deadliest in Oakland\u2019s history, sent shockwaves through the vibrant underground scene in the northern California city, which is a haven for experimental art and music. \u201cThis is a mass loss. It\u2019s reverberating throughout the entire community,\u201d said Sarah Carlberg, assistant director of the Bay Area Book Festival, who knew many at the party. \u201cEvery one of those people were really active community makers and agents of culture and art.\u201d The last victims identified were Jonathan Bernbaum, Barrett Clark, Michele Sylvan, Peter Wadsworth and Nicholas Walrath. Cash Askew, 22 Askew, an Oakland resident, was well known for her band Them Are Us Too, an emerging goth duo who launched their first album with Dais Records. \u201cShe was without a doubt one of the most talented and loving people we\u2019ve ever known,\u201d the label wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe will never be the same.\u201d Friends and loved ones have offered tributes online, with the band Wax Idols writing: \u201cI cannot find words adequate enough to describe what a loss this is.

She was always a champion for people who were on the margins.\u201d Bohlka said he plans to establish a fund at a local LGBT center \u201cin memory of Em, so that more transgender people will be able to become who they truly are, and so that there will be more safe spaces available\u201d. Jonathan Bernbaum, 34 A visual artist from Berkeley, Bernbaum toured with musical acts around the world and was remembered by his friends as a generous, joyful man whose creativity spilled out into every part of his life.

His brother, Paul Igaz, wrote in a Facebook tribute, \u201cHe shaped me in many areas of life beyond music, but it was in particular his ability to transmit to me his love of music \u2013 and through music, an appreciation of a culture of diversity \u2013 that ensures that his soul will live within my soul, and the soul of all who know him or his music, eternally.\u201d Nick Gomez-Hall, 25 Gomez-Hall, from Coronado in southern California, worked at Counterpoint Press, a publisher in Berkeley. The company wrote on Facebook: \u201cWhether he was recommending new music to listen to (and it was always so good), regaling us with tales of the bowling alley, offering his beloved truck for a ride if anyone needed it, or sharing his much appreciated opinions about a book jacket or manuscript, he made everyone feel like they were his friend. He was kind, considerate, hilarious.\u201d Gomez-Hall studied at Brown University, where community members were mourning on Monday and sharing memories of his music.
