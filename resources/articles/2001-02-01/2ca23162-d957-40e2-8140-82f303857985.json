The American brewing company had been seen as the favourite to take over from Carling, which last month pulled out of negotiations to renew its deal. But Budweiser said yesterday that it would not be involved in the \"final bidding process\" now under way. The Premier League is expected to name its new sponsor in the next fortnight. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are thought to be among the front runners but other companies are understood still to be negotiating. Budweiser's decision comes after it had discussed a deal worth about \u00a315m-20m a year. It appears finance was behind its withdrawal. Reports that it had demanded American football-style conditions, such as grounds with no other perimeter advertising and a guarantee of top players always being available for interview, were wide of the mark. Budweiser said yesterday it would focus on its role as official beer sponsor of the 2002 World Cup. Wolves made the first major signing since Dave Jones became their manager last month when they paid Sunderland \u00a31m for the Republic of Ireland defender Paul Butler. Butler, 28, who has signed a 3-year deal, played five games for Wolves on loan before Christmas but a permanent move was delayed when Colin Lee was sacked as manager. Stan Collymore has completed his free transfer from Bradford City to the Spanish first division side Real Oviedo. Ian Rush, the former Liverpool player, has joined Barnsley part-time as strikers' coach. The former Aston Villa defender Allan Evans has been sacked as Morton's manager after their 4-1 Scottish Cup defeat by Peterhead. Joe Kinnear has left the Second Division's bottom side Oxford United after four months as director of football. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
