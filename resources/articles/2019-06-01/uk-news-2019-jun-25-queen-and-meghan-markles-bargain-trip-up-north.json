Linda Rhead Hampton, London \u2022 The sculpture in Bilbao (Letters page, 25 June) is by the renowned woman sculptor Louise Bourgeois. It would have been nice if you could have acknowledged this in the text as it has more significance than as A Spider from Mars. She died in 2010 at 98 and was working well into her 90s. Worth reading her biography. Jane Officer Birmingham \u2022 Jane Moth is puzzled that female footballers are called \u201cLionesses\u201d (Letters, 25 June).

Margaret Farnworth Liverpool \u2022 Eric Ogden\u2019s amusement (Letters, 25 June) at the possibilities of the Fox/Hunt combination (and why not Johnson, Hancock and Truss for that matter) gives me hope that someone will come up with something to rival that all-time favourite concerning compulsive 1950s polar explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs, immortalised in the headline, \u201cDr Fuchs off again\u201d.
