He led the well-regarded Labour administration on Fife council for nine years and was held in high esteem across the political spectrum. At Westminster, he was a loyalist in the Labour mainstream, which reflected his belief in party unity. In spite of a long illness, he continued to attend conscientiously to his constituency duties until the last weeks of his life. His last visit to the House of Commons, in circumstances of great pain, was in June to vote in support of the government over 42-day detention for terrorist suspects. MacDougall grew up in a Fife tradition of big politicians, at both local and national levels. Whenever the need arose - which it invariably did in response to every outbreak of local government reorganisation - he was at the forefront of campaigns to ensure that the kingdom of Fife remained a single, undivided entity. He enjoyed a close political and personal relationship with the prime minister Gordon Brown, who paid this tribute to him: \"In Fife, [John MacDougall] pioneered free travel for the elderly, led Scotland and Britain with nursery education for three and four-year-olds, was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at Rosyth naval base, and was well known for his support of all local causes.\" The industrial disease that killed MacDougall is linked to contact with asbestos, and his doctors believed it probably derived from his early working days at the Royal naval dockyards in Rosyth. Born in Dunfermline, and educated at Templehall secondary school, Kirkcaldy, he served a boilermaker's apprenticeship before studying naval architecture at the Royal Dockyard College. He later obtained a diploma in industrial management. He then worked at the RGC oil rig construction yard in Methil, becoming shop stewards convener in 1978, a role in which he prided himself on never having led a strike: \"I could win more for the men through argument and negotiation.\" This was his style - not flamboyant but definitely respected for his cool head and commitment to social justice. After joining the Labour party in 1981, MacDougall became a councillor for Burntisland, the town in which he lived for most of his life, and for 19 years was always returned with huge majorities. He became the full-time leader of Fife regional council in 1987, serving until its abolition under local government reform. He was elected to the new Fife unitary council in 1995, becoming convenor when the council assumed its powers the following year. One of the local causes on which he devoted much energy was the demand for a second road bridge across the river Forth - now likely to be fulfilled; another was an attempt to build on Fife's coalfield tradition by making it a centre for energy innovation, both renewable and clean coal technology. He was also a member of the Scottish constitutional convention, which established the framework for the Scottish parliament. In 2001, Henry McLeish, the sitting MP for Fife Central, left Westminster for the Scottish parliament; MacDougall took his place, winning the Commons seat with a majority of 10,075. Following a boundary review, the seat became Glenrothes, which he took in the 2005 general election. He is survived by his wife Cathy, whom he married in 1968, and his children, Scott and Julie. \u00b7 John William MacDougall, politician, born December 8 1947; died August 13 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
