He told ABC radio that the government would release its mid-year budget update on 19 December with an updated projection for the likely date for a return to surplus. Deloitte Access Economics released its latest Budget Monitor on Monday, warning the federal budget deficit was projected to expand by another $24.3bn over the next four years. It said Australia\u2019s record low wages growth and a shortfall in company tax were likely to blow a hole in the income tax take, dashing the government\u2019s hopes of returning the budget to surplus in 2020-21, and raising the spectre of credit ratings downgrade. When asked about Deloitte\u2019s report, Morrison said he had always been \u201cvery careful\u201d when talking about the likelihood of returning the budget to surplus. He said the government\u2019s 2020-21 date was a projection based on the best available numbers in the May budget. \u201cWhat I said was that the projection based on the parameters at the time was that the budget would return to balance in 2020-21,\u201d he told ABC host Michael Brissenden. \u201cNow I\u2019ve always been very careful about that \u2026 I know others in the past have made bold predictions and promises about these things. \u201cThe 2020-21 budget balance position was a projection based on those numbers. Now these numbers move, they always have.\u201d Brissenden asked Morrison: \u201cSo if the numbers aren\u2019t there you won\u2019t get to that [surplus] position [by 2020-21]?\u201d Morrison replied: \u201cWell that\u2019s simple arithmetic. But no one has made that call yet, and no one\u2019s suggesting that yet.\u201d He also repeated his argument that Australia had an \u201cearnings problem\u201d, with wages growing at a record slow pace, company profits down, much lower terms of trade, and lower commodity prices, so the government had to keep cutting spending. When he first became treasurer last year, Morrison had said Australia had \u201ca spending problem, not a revenue problem,\u201d but he changed his mind in August this year, admitting the country did have an \u201cearnings problem\u201d. \u201cOur nominal growth today is lower than our real growth, by a full percentage point,\u201d he told the Bloomberg Economic Summit in Sydney in August. \u201cThis is an uncommon predicament and a core challenge in working to bring the budget back to balance.\u201d After Labor\u2019s 2012 budget, the then shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, told the National Press Club that a future Abbott government would generate many surpluses. \u201cBased on the numbers presented last Tuesday night we will achieve a surplus in our first year in office and we will achieve a surplus for every year of our first term,\u201d Hockey had said. In early 2015, after a huge fall in commodity prices, and struggling to get large savings measures through the Senate, Hockey told the Coalition party room that the budget may \u201cnever get back to surplus.\u201d Hockey left the Treasurer\u2019s portfolio without delivering a surplus, like Labor treasurer Wayne Swan before him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
