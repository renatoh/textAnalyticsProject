How then do you explain Burnley, who managed to dig out a decent performance and result at the expense of West Brom, despite it being their seventh match so far in January? Throw in the soul-destroying experience of last Wednesday night's extra-time aggregate defeat to Spurs in the Carling Cup semi-final and the Lancashire side's efforts here were even more laudable. The only fly in the ointment is that the Claret-and-Blues now have an extra match to play in the near future. A replay was the least Burnley deserved, though the 24th-minute penalty from which they opened the scoring certainly had a soft look about it. Jonathan Greening's challenge on Robbie Blake appeared slight, but down went the winger and up stepped Graham Alexander to drill his shot high to Scott Carson's right. Albion countered strongly and scored twice before the break. Robert Koren notched the first with a splendidly hit volley from 20 yards, then in first-half stoppage time Kim Do-heon's free-kick took a vicious deflection to wrong-foot Brian Jensen and Burnley's heroic yet ultimately futile week looked complete. Not so. If Carson had not pulled off a candidate for save of the season, pawing away a Steve Thompson header from point-blank range, then Burnley would have pulled level in the 71st minute. As it was, they had to wait until two minutes from time to score the equaliser they so richly deserved, Martin Paterson sweeping home Wade Elliott's cross to spark delirious scenes in the away end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
