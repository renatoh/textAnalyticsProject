No sooner had he established himself as something more substantial than a former boyband pin-up than he started making noticeably more adventurous records than was strictly necessary. It was as if he were taking risks in order to keep himself interested in music, rather than acting, fashion design, golf course ownership or any of the multitude of other things his latter-day career involves. The shadow of Prince, Kraftwerk and David Bowie\u2019s album Diamond Dogs hung over at least some of 2006\u2019s FutureSex/LoveSounds, while 2013\u2019s The 20/20 Experience offered the sound of visionary hip hop and R&amp;B producer Timbaland at his most exploratory and audacious. But Man of the Woods may be Timberlake\u2019s riskiest musical venture to date. Its USP is \u201cAmericana with 808s\u201d, an attempt by the singer and producers Timbaland and the Neptunes to meld the country and western and southern rock of his native Tennessee with latterday R&amp;B. Cue songs with names such as Livin\u2019 Off the Land, guest appearances from the Nashville star Chris Stapleton, a songwriting credit for Toby Keith and so much lyrical boosting of Timberlake\u2019s southern roots that it\u2019s hard not to feel he may be laying it on a bit thick. This is obviously ambitious, but it\u2019s not entirely without precedent: in the late 60s and early 70s, the lines between R&amp;B and country were frequently blurred. If you wanted to give a certain kind of heritage rock mag-reading music fan a case of the vapours, you might suggest that what Timberlake is trying to do is a kind of 21st-century answer to the country-soul hybrid peddled by Tony Joe White, Dan Penn or Jim Ford. The big difference is that joining the sonic dots between the two genres is far more difficult today than it was 40 years ago: the kind of R&amp;B in which Timbaland and the Neptunes specialise is boldly futuristic, while the country and southern rock Timberlake wants to evoke is entirely traditional. Melding the two is a tough call, and the finished product is of decidedly mixed quality. At one extreme, there\u2019s some fantastic music here. Midnight Summer\u2019s Jam is skeletal, hyperactive disco, with a chorus you could imagine Earth Wind And Fire singing, lightly dressed with harmonica and fiddle. The Hard Stuff offers a bewitching haze of acoustic guitar, pedal steel and electronics. The single Supplies is utterly thrilling: spectral, vaguely psychedelic mandolin, Pharrell Williams growling and barking words, and lyrics which, improbably, use backwoods survivalism as a metaphor for sex. At the other, there\u2019s stuff that sounds awkward \u2013 Sauce\u2019s ungainly lurches from funk-rock to Nashville and back again \u2013 or flatly awful: you can see what they\u2019ve tried to do on Wave \u2013 stick a perky walking-bassline country song over a half-speed R&amp;B slow jam beat \u2013 but the overall effect is just horrible, while Flannel deals in one of country\u2019s least appealing aspects, schmaltz. Some tracks don\u2019t recall country, southern rock or R&amp;B so much as the surfer-friendly, reggae-tinged acoustic pop of Jack Johnson, which is a pretty peculiar end result, given the intention. But for all its flaws, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by Man of the Woods. You can hear the effort that went into making it: Timberlake could more easily have churned out an identikit pop album using the same writing and production teams that every identikit pop album calls on, and relied on his celebrity to make it a massive hit. The good bits are great, the bad bits best avoided, but in a pop world where originality isn\u2019t much encouraged, there\u2019s something really laudable about the intention behind it, and its author\u2019s willingness to think outside the box."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
