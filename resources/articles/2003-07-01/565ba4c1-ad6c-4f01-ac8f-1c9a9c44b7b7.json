For the rest of the field, that is the good news. The bad news is that the other two misses were for a birdie - he made par - and an eagle - he settled for a birdie - in a round cut to 10 holes, presumably to minimise the attentions of camera-clicking spectators. As on Tuesday, he teed off at 6.15am and did so accompanied by the wiry Charles Howell III, plus his usual entourage of security guards, police, coach, caddie and about 200 spectators. After he and Howell had completed the 1st and 2nd holes, each caddie dropped balls for their men to play approach shots to the four sectors of the green where they assume the competition pins will be placed. After completing his reconnaissance of the 2nd, Woods walked to the tee of the par-three 3rd, where spectators had already gathered, and beckoned to his waiting security guard. The party then carried on to the 11th. \"I think he's got his own plan in mind,\" said the wistful minder. The majority of the spectators followed and the par-three 11th was played in regulation figures, before Woods and Howell made their experimental ways back to the 18th. Tiger picked up another birdie at the 17th, by which time the crowd had swollen to a couple of thousand. Autographs were not an option and interaction minimal but he greeted one \"Good luck, Tiger\" with a polite \"Thanks\" and later shook the hand of a more zealous supporter. By 8.45am the pair had finished, shook hands and leapt into a buggy which whipped them off to the practice ground. Woods set to work on his short irons before going through the full repertoire, his coach Butch Harmon standing by dutifully. Howell reappeared on the 1st tee at 11.20 and began another round, with Kenny Perry. Perhaps he was keen to check out the holes Woods missed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
