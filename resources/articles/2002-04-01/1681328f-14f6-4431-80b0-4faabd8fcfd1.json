The home side, who had not won since 2 February, also became the only team other than Celtic to defeat Rangers in the league this season. The result puts Livingston level on points with Aberdeen, behind the Old Firm, but a home win had not looked likely early on when slack defending gifted the visitors a fourth-minute lead. Andrei Kanchelskis floated a corner into a crowded six-yard box but Lorenzo Amoruso still found the room to head home. Javier Sanchez Broto was required to prevent Michael Mols from doubling that lead when the Rangers man produced one of his trademark turns followed by a low drive. The Spaniard could only parry but defender Didier Santini was there to mop up. Livingston began to get back into the the game and it needed a fine save from Stefan Klos in the Rangers goal to preserve the lead. Cherif Toure Maman gained control of the ball just outside the area to feed Barry Wilson in the box and when the ball was fired into the danger zone Cherif was there to get a close-range connection only for the German to parry. Klos was behind a Stevie Tosh volley soon afterwards but was given no chance with the equaliser when Wilson received the ball from Santini some 25 yards from goal and turned to smash it into the top corner. The second half began in similar fashion to the first, with Rangers taking the early initiative only to be pegged back later. Maurice Ross, who is hoping to hold on to the Rangers right-back position when Fernando Ricksen returns from suspension, made a rare foray forward but Broto denied him an even rarer goal with a spectacular tip over. Rangers sent on Tore Andre Flo in place of Billy Dodds but it was David Fernandez who set up the winning goal for Livingston. Captain Lovell, on as a substitute, was the man who provided it, launching himself into the air to fire a bicycle kick past Klos with two minutes left. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
