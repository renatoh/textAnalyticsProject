With Andrew Shore as the cheerfully leering, murderous protagonist, and conductor Edward Gardner ensuring that Birtwistle's score has all the force it can muster in the confines of the Young Vic, it is easy to imagine oneself back at the famous first performance of Punch and Judy at the Aldeburgh festival 40 years ago, when the brazen aggression of the music drove some of the audience out at the interval - including, it's always said, Benjamin Britten himself. After that initial impact, though, doubts begin to creep in. Not over Shore's towering portrayal, which is a dramatic triumph from beginning to end, or the high quality of the other performances. The problem is the way director Daniel Kramer realises the work on stage, even if in some ways his production follows Birtwistle's dramatic prescription more closely than most. The wind players are seated apart from the rest of the ensemble, behind the circus ring that serves as the focus of Giles Cadle's set. Ashley Holland's authoritative Choregos, the Greek chorus-cum-master of ceremonies who links the human world to the puppet origins of the other characters, and Gillian Keith's simpering Pretty Poll, the object of Punch's affections, have their own stations on stage. The stylised violence and the mixture of ritual and anarchy are uncomfortably real. But as the 100-minute work goes on, Kramer introduces a troupe of dancers - Punch lookalikes - who join in the final murder of Choregos. These blur the dramatic economy from which much of the work's raw power derives. The production loses its nerve at the very point when it should be most focused. And with the singers in one place, the wind in another and the rest of instruments elsewhere again, one constantly has to piece the sound picture together in a way that becomes ever less convincing. There is still much to admire in the evening, though. The score is ageless and extraordinary, and to hear it performed by singers of the quality of Shore - as well as Lucy Schaufer as Judy, Graham Clark as the Lawyer and Graeme Broadbent as the Doctor - is a delight. The Young Vic space, totally reconfigured since Lost Highway two weeks ago, shows its versatility, too. ENO has every reason to regard its short season there as a success. \u00b7 In rep until Sunday.
