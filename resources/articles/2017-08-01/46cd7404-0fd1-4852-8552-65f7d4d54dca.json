Marc Francis, chair of Tower Hamlets council\u2019s development committee, told developer Regal Homes on Wednesday that its plans had failed to win approval because not enough had been done to ensure that a new LGBT bar would thrive amid the development of offices and luxury flats. Francis said the council welcomed Regal\u2019s ground-breaking planning proviso to ensure that an LGBT operator had first refusal to rent the space for 12 years, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded that this goes far enough.\u201d Over the past decade, London has lost 58% of its LGBT venues as their prime locations have been snapped up by developers, and some clubgoers have abandoned nights out for Grindr, Tinder and other \u201chookup\u201d apps. Eleven London boroughs, including Harringay and Kensington and Chelsea, have lost all their LGBT bars. Tower Hamlets has lost seven of its 10 LGBT venues since 2006. Campaigners, who attended the council meeting in T-shirts reading \u201cLong live queer spaces\u201d under rainbow umbrellas, welcomed the council\u2019s decision as a victory for \u201cqueer power\u201d and hoped that the developer would meet their demands for a larger, better-equipped venue with a later licence and outdoor smoking area. In an emotional speech, Amy Roberts, co-chair of the Friends of the Joiners Arms campaign group, told the committee that she was campaigning for the Joiners as it was one of few places in London were she felt safe enough to kiss another woman without fear of attack. \u201cThere was an immense feeling of liberation in [the Joiners Arms],\u201d She said. \u201cOn nights in non-queers spaces I\u2019ve had pictures taken of me while making out with another woman.\u201d Roberts said Regal\u2019s proposals for a single-level bar closing at half past midnight at weekends was \u201cnot a viable replacement for east London\u2019s most iconic LGBT venue\u201d. She said the developers\u2019 offer to give first refusal for the tenancy to an LGBT operator for the first 12 years was \u201cnothing more than a Trojan horse draped in a rainbow flag\u201d. Under pressure from the Tower Hamlets council and the mayor of London, the developer had written into its planning application that the development would include a pub that would \u201cremain a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-focused venue for a minimum of 12 years\u201d. It is believed to be the first time that the sexual orientation of a venue\u2019s target clientele has been included as a condition of planning approval. Roberts welcomed the council\u2019s decision to defer the planning decision for a month while they sought further reassurances from the developers. \u201cSo many of the spaces where we feel safe have been closed down and taken away from us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to fight to protect them, and I\u2019m so pleased that the council has listened to our concerns. I\u2019ve been violently attacked, and I couldn\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve been verbally attacked in the street, which I\u2019m sure is true for all people who don\u2019t look straight walking down the street.\u201d Councillors were concerned that the developers proposed to lease the space as a bare shell without bar facilities or toilets and worried that refurbishing costs might make taking on the venture too prohibitively expensive for a community-run gay bar. Councillor Chris Chapman, who told the meeting he had also suffered homophobic attacks in the capital, called on the developer to help meet the costs of fitting out the bar. A spokesman for Regal Homes indicated that the developer would consider helping with the costs, and had already offered to let the space rent-free for the first year. A spokesperson for Regal said in a statement: \u201cWe fully acknowledge the council\u2019s decision and look forward to working with them and the LGBTQI+ parties to ensure the ultimate success of this scheme for all.\u201d Campaigners, who held placards outside the town hall reading \u201cAll the fun happens after midnight\u201d, were also concerned that the proposed venue would stay open only until half past midnight. The Joiners Arms, which was closed in 2015 shortly after Regal bought the Hackney Road site, was open until 4am. Peter Cragg, of the Friends of the Joiners Arms, said he was \u201cpretty thrilled\u201d that the council had listened to the campaigners concerns and not \u201ctold us what we want and just accepted the developers recommendations\u201d. \u201cOur demands are pretty radical, that it becomes a community-run space. I\u2019d love to see the Joiners Arms back on Hackney Road as it was and as it should be, not a wine bar that closes at half-midnight.\u201d The Joiners, which was opened as a gay bar by landlord David Pollard in May 1997, quickly became an east London institution. Pollard said the purpose of Joiners was to provide a space for \u201cjoyful sinners\u201d. \u201cIf you want to enjoy yourself, come in. But we don\u2019t want to know how important you are. Are you interesting to talk to? Are you a good shag? Can you dance? These are the questions we\u2019re interested in as a pub,\u201d he told i-D magazine. Many regulars were leading lights of fashion, music and the arts. They included the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, singer-songwriters Rufus Wainwright and Patrick Wolf, designer Christopher Kane, actor Rupert Everett, and Westlife\u2019s Mark Feehily. Craig Green, the British menswear designer of the year, got one of his first jobs working behind the bar, and Turner prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans was often seen documenting life in the bar with his camera."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
