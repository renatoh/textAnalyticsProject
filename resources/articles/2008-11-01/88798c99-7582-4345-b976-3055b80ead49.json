Andrew Miller in Columbus, Ohio, put it like this: \"Being on the Obama side of things, we're all on pins and needles.\" It's not just because as a Democrat he watched John Kerry go down to an election-deciding defeat in his state four years ago. It's not just that the race is tight in the state, with Barack Obama holding onto a five or six point edge in the polls, but he's also concerned with voting issues in the state. Even four years after George Bush was re-elected, the state is still bogged down in legal battles over the last election. Democrats have lingering concerns over the voting machines and ID requirements for voting that some in the party believe could lead to voter intimidation. Republicans have grown increasingly angry over voter registration fraud tied to the community organising group Acorn. \"It's interesting that the United States is held up as a beacon of democracy, yet we have so many issues with voting. And we have such low voter turnout compared to a lot of countries,\" he said. It's worth noting that voter turnout has been steadily increasing in last few elections, and this year some secretaries of state predict that 80% of registered voters could vote, and nationally, more than 60% of eligible voters are expected to cast a ballot, which would surpass the high water mark for modern elections in 1960, according to the political scientist Larry Sabato. Lawyers already involved This is the first election in several years that Andrew won't be working as a poll worker or precinct judge, and he had intended to vote on election day because he hasn't been able to in the past. \"I got so anxious about the election that I voted early with a paper ballot,\" he said. He has deep concerns about the voting process. \"In the '04 and '06 [elections], there are documented examples of vote flipping,\" he said. Vote flipping is when touch-screen machines register a different choice than the voter intended. Voting rights group have also seen paper ballots with stickers placed over the top of the ballots that could prevent optical-scan machines from correctly registering the vote, Andrew said. Cliff Arnebeck, a Columbus lawyer involved with an ongoing lawsuit over the 2004 election, said: \"We have sworn affidavits from people who saw white stickers placed over the Kerry-Edward ovals in this optical scan county.\" Some Democrats are less worried this year with a Democratic secretary of state overseeing the election, but Andrew says, \"My concern is generally how valid the results are going to be regardless of who is in charge.\" As a precinct judge and poll worker, he saw a range of procedural problems. People didn't know what form of identification they needed in order to vote. People had moved and had outdated identification and didn't know whether they needed to vote provisionally. Provisional balloting was meant to ensure that everyone could cast a vote, but it's turned into a complicating factor in elections that leaves them open to legal challenges. \"It wasn't necessarily any concerted effort [to deny people the right to vote], but the rules have become so confusing that your average voter, poll worker or even precinct judges don't fully understand what the guidelines are on whether someone can vote,\" he said. Andrew thinks there is an \"incredibly high chance\" that the result in Ohio will be challenged legally. The election process already has been in court. Republicans have sued over voter registration drives in Ohio. The Republican party challenged same-day voter registration and early voting in Ohio, and a Columbus-based think tank filed a lawsuit against Acorn calling on the organisation to be dissolved for submitting fradulent voter registration applications. The American Civil Liberties Union sued one county in an effort to force election officials to accept the same-day voter registrations. In terms of Republicans' accusations of fraud, Andrew pointed out something that many Democrats have in terms of the lawsuits against Acorn. This is registration fraud, not voter fraud, he said. Voter registrations under the name Mickey Mouse or members of American football teams are being caught. \"People are not voting under these names,\" he said. \"Registering under Mickey Mouse and being caught by the secretary of state is exactly how the system is supposed to work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
