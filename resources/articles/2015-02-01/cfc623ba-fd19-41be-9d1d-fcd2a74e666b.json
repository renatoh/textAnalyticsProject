At least, the world was certainly watching at 5.30pm GMT. After which the world may at some point have found itself a little distracted or remembered an urgent appointment on the other channel with Chinese Idol, or Big Boss, or Qui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario? Either way, Chelsea\u2019s and Manchester City\u2019s intense, occasionally heavy-legged 1-1 draw qualifies as the Premier League\u2019s most-watched game ever in terms of rights holders present, broadcasters employed, TV sets reached and \u201ceyeballs\u201d hauled in. If the action itself was sometimes less than prime-time entertainment, then this is simply the nature of the game, not least in the fine margins of a mid-winter title race. A point suited both sides well enough. Chelsea are still clear at the top. City remain as they were: in the race if not quite on the shoulder. Beyond this, if there were winners on Saturday they were probably Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. Chelsea certainly looked tired and understandably so given those thrilling 120 minutes against Liverpool on Tuesday night. City hardly looked full throttle either with several players clearly feeling their way to freshness and form. This is simply the nature of the English league which has always been won at a stagger, not a canter. And yet in the middle of this Chelsea will also play PSG in two weeks\u2019 time in the Champions League last 16. Marco Verratti, who will look to dominate the midfield possession for their opponents, has featured in 29 matches this season. Nemanja Matic, who will look to chase and close him down, has played 37. Similarly Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG\u2019s own spiky goalscoring menace, has played 24 matches to Diego Costa\u2019s 29. While for City, Fernandinho (31 games) will be required to concentrate as hard as at any stage this season while shutting down the space in which Neymar (26) likes to create for Barcelona. This is not to make excuses, to crank up once again the debate over a winter break, or even to engage in any domestic hand-wringing over a match that was understandably tight. In any case there were still some encouraging signs for both teams at the Bridge. Chelsea\u2019s central midfield defensive block looked more resolute. City\u2019s defence coped better with Eden Hazard who has in the past made Pablo Zabaleta suffer. Really, though, the lasting impression was of fatigue, physical and mental, and a genuine regret for the neutral that there is not a third contender for the title. Just as both leading teams will drop points from here so the real shame is that the chasing pack are not able to apply more pressure. Southampton, Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all either in buoyant form or further down the line to untangling their own knots. Oh, for another five points in autumn. How long it takes the leaders to find their second wind will perhaps decide the destiny of the league. It has become received wisdom that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has erred in failing to rotate his line-up, although the truth is a little more mixed. Every member of the back five has had a rest in recent weeks just as the central midfield two have been mixed and matched regularly. Against this Hazard, so vital to Chelsea\u2019s incision, has played 10 games in six weeks while Matic and Cesc F\u00e0bregas have generally always appeared at some stage when fit. Chelsea have a large squad with cover in all positions, not to mention those 26 players out on loan. But there is no doubt Mourinho has his trusted irreplaceables and that one or two of them look a little weary right now. Possibly Mourinho will adapt from here. It would be interesting to see a bolstering of the midfield and a lessening of Matic\u2019s burden with Ramires and F\u00e0bregas both playing a little deeper in a three. The (planned) signing of Juan Cuadrado also makes sense: Chelsea\u2019s speed and penetration in wide areas comes almost exclusively from Hazard. Cuadrado can share the burden. And, at \u00a323.3m Mourinho will surely trust him with the opportunity. On a similar note, Costa\u2019s ban carries with it the consolation of a refreshed all-action centre forward for the trip to Paris and the slog of early spring. For City, creative reinforcements are also in the offing. Samir Nasri was playing well when he injured a calf but should be back next week. Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s return will bring variation as well as class and power. Wilfried Bony is an excellent addition for a title run-in, a fine all-round finisher who offers Premier League-ready physicality and an alternative route to goal. Either way, if Saturday\u2019s match was intended to showcase the Premier League, it did precisely that in the end. This remains a physically gruelling title race, a battle of attrition as much as wits where, like so may other things in life, the winners often tend to be those who simply refuse to stop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
