For Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour party, it was the bold, if belated, decision earlier this year to break with the Murdochs in the midst of the phone-hacking scandal. In interviews several months later, rather like a magician pleased to discover that there actually is a rabbit to pull out of the hat, he still sounds surprised at his own acuity. \"People had a sense that we were reflecting the mood of the country,\" he has said. \"And that's what you try to do as leader of the opposition\u2026 it was a set of people whose power had never been challenged and who thought they were untouchable. That's why you've got to rip up the rule book.\" Unfortunately for Mr Miliband, as his critics are quick to point out, much of the rule book was written during New Labour's 13 years of power. It was during this time, as Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, reminded the Liberal Democrat conference, that the Labour leader and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, were \"the back-room boys\" for Blair and Brown, \"always plotting, always scheming\". Undaunted, Mr Miliband has hinted that \"ripping up the rule book\" will be one of the major themes of this year's Labour party conference beginning today in Liverpool. How that develops into a political vision that resonates both with Labour supporters and the wider public at a time of drastic cuts, rising prices and downward mobility is Mr Miliband's challenge. How might he rise to the occasion? Mr Miliband has everything against him and, therefore, perhaps nothing to lose. While Labour is just ahead in the polls, Mr Miliband's personal appeal is poor. According to yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll, only 30% of voters and 49% of Labour supporters agree with the statement: \"The party has the right leader in Ed Miliband.\" He has possibly three years to change the electorate's mind. His speech on Tuesday will be key to that process, as he acknowledges in his interview with the Observer today. As he points out, keeping his head down is not an option. A major millstone is Labour's chronic lack of fiscal credibility. New Labour allowed itself to be deflected by admiration for the rich, the banks and the City. Consequently, the party isn't trusted with the public purse \u2013 and that lack of trust previously kept it out of power for 18 years. So far, while criticising government for cutting too fast and too deep, Mr Miliband has yet to detail how Labour would tailor the cuts to stimulate growth while keeping to the former chancellor Alistair Darling's plan to halve the deficit in four years. However, some policy details have emerged. They include a \u00a36,000 cap on tuition fees revealed in the Observer and yesterday's announcement that Labour would act against price-fixing by the six energy companies. These have a theme that this paper sees as heartening. It's a theme that, thanks to the current bumper harvest of \"legacy-lite\" autobiographies of prominent political players, tells us that while Mr Miliband might have been a New Labour apprentice for many years, he may have grown into a different politician. Philip Gould in The Unfinished Revolution, for instance, says that Ed Miliband was \"never fully comfortable with New Labour, he wanted something more emphatic, more ideological\". So Miliband has talked of the \"squeezed middle\" (a group with which an increasingly large number identify, irrespective of income); the plight of young people and the need for \"a new settlement\". He says he abhors the old settlement, one that is about \"an ethic of take what you can, something for nothing, the short term, the fast buck\". Where Mr Miliband is at risk is in defining the new. He says in the Observer interview that he believes that the country is ripe for \"this moment of reckoning\". Elections are won when the centre is won but since the centre is always dynamic, Miliband appears to be banking on the support of \"a new centre ground\" \u2013 one united by concern about \"the gap between the rich and everyone else\". One that may also be troubled by the marketisation of every aspect of our lives, including health and education and the manner in which materialism is corroding the values and relationships that are at the heart of a decent, well-functioning society. The electorate can and has united in the past behind a political leader with the rhetoric, vision and character to define, at a particular period, a different path ahead. It happened with Margaret Thatcher and it happened again in 1997 under Tony Blair. However, neither was labouring in an era of austerity infused with such profound mistrust of the establishment. Can Ed Miliband find the right words to describe the Britain of which he wishes to be part? The Observer endorses Mr Miliband's view that this is the time for boldness and risk-taking. The evidence that \"bad\" capitalism has failed is all around. The neoliberalism that began in the 1970s has resulted in a global financial crisis and the demonisation of the public sector and the welfare state. The belief that tax cuts, deregulation and small government would enable wealth to trickle down to the benefit of all has proved an expensive mirage. New Labour's adoption of key aspects of this agenda meant it failed to broadcast many of its notable achievements, for instance Sure Start, the minimum wage and combating child poverty. Mr Miliband's different kind of settlement needs to champion these achievements and articulate a better form of capitalism that treats equality and prosperity as intrinsic to each other rather than separate and competing goals. A new settlement imposes responsibilities on the rich as well as the poor; it stops the government's ideological and extreme reduction and privatisation of the welfare state. Instead, it sees the state as a springboard, an enabler for citizens, not a paternalistic creator of greater dependency. Better capitalism recognises that the more equal a society is, the more prosperous it is, so top pay rises no faster than low incomes. It encourages long-termism in investment in industry and manufacturing; it ensures that families are protected from the challenges they cannot manage alone \u2013 illness; childcare; unemployment. It's a society that works for all, not just the affluent few. On Tuesday, we hope we will hear more of Mr Miliband's new settlement. Then we shall also learn whether caution is his undoing \u2013 or whether, once again, he can seize the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
