Although Southampton had been interested in appointing Hoddle the story was written with a misplaced certainty and a lack of qualification for which we apologise. An editing error in a comment article gave the impression that the Lancet's estimate of 100,000 Iraqi deaths since the invasion applied only to civilians. The authors of the Lancet report state that \"many\" of the dead in their sample may have been combatants (No excuses, page 25, December 9). On the same day a leader article quoted the same report and stated that \"up to 98,000 have died\". That figure is, statistically, the most probable based on the survey. It could be higher, or lower (Dead reckoning, page 27). We printed a black and white photograph of St Paul's cathedral, taken in about 1950, in which the clock appears in the left tower of the west front instead of the right one. The original photograph, supplied to us by an agency, had been flipped (Pauline conversion, page 9, December 7, early editions). The Northern Ireland newspaper, the Andersonstown News, is owned by the Andersonstown News Group, not Andersontown (Tensions rise on Ulster's newsstands page 21, December 7). Dame Elizabeth Neville, who appeared in our Birthdays column, page 29, December 4 (marking her birthday the following day, Sunday), is no longer chief constable of Wiltshire. She actually left the force in September this year and was succeeded by Martin Richards. We described the emblem of former East Germany as a hammer and a pair of protractors. It is, in fact, a pair of dividers set on a hammer (email, page 18, December 6). \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
