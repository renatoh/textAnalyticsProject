Sophie Turner Laing, the BBC's controller of acquisitions, will head up the satellite broadcaster's films and acquisitions business. Ms Turner Laing, 42, joined the corporation five years ago and was the BBC's acting director of television before Jana Bennett's return last year. \"I am thrilled to welcome someone of Sophie's talents to Sky,\" said Ms Airey. \"She has an enviable track record for timely and imaginative acquisitions and a very strong commercial reputation. She will thrive in the growing multichannel environment and build on Sky's status as the destination point for film and series.\" Ms Turner Laing will report directly to Ms Airey, the former chief executive of Channel 5, who arrived at Sky last week. Her other acquisitions at the BBC have included Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Malcolm in the Middle and Steven Spielberg's alien abduction series, Taken, which was watched by nearly 5 million people on BBC2 on Saturday night. Her film deals have included Titanic, Chicken Run, Walt Disney hits like Toy Story and the Harry Potter series. Jana Bennett, the BBC's director of television, said: \"Sophie is a formidable operator in the international market and highly regarded within the television industry. She has a keen eye for upcoming trends and has contributed enormously to the BBC's ability to bring some of the best programme acquisitions to British television. \"We are reluctantly parting company with Sophie, but appreciate she was made an offer she just could not refuse.\" Ms Turner Laing, who was once described as a \"tough old bird, with a heart of gold who has a computer for a brain, never repeats mistakes and doesn't suffer fools,\" joined the corporation as head of acquired programmes in 1998. She was later appointed to controller, programme acquisition and controller of business affairs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
