But free-flowing rugby alone is not enough to win a competition as fierce as the Guinness Premiership, and in this victory over Northampton there were signs that Meehan's side are starting to marry their attacking instincts with a more hard-headed desire to grind out results. It looks an ominous combination for their rivals. The result, sealed by two second-half tries from Michael Claassens, put Bath back on top of the Premiership table. Meehan, a calm and softly-spoken man, refused to get carried away with his side's position. \"It doesn't mean much to be top on 1 January,\" he wryly observed. \"I'll be a lot happier if we are still there in April.\" Meehan went on to grumble: \"We won't be overly pleased with our performance, our play was not consistent enough.\" Even the outstanding Claassens earned an underwhelming review from his coach. \"It was his best individual performance in a number of weeks, but then the two tries were really just the law of averages \u2014 he's had plenty of goes in recent matches, and they've not come off.\" The Australian also criticised his side, and by implication his scrum-half, for \"not being quicker to the breakdown and sharper in distributing the ball\". The man is clearly a perfectionist. Bath took an early lead through Matt Banahan, who stooped to gather a grubber from Butch James and swept over the line. James was playing in front of his parents, who had come over from South Africa to join him for Christmas, and Meehan suggested he clearly had a point to prove. He was in far from his finest form, but as well as making the first try he kicked two crucial penalties that held a resurgent Northampton at arm's length during the remainder of the first half, in which the Saints dominated possession and territory. James also put in a bone-shaking tackle on James Downey in the second half, galvanising both team-mates and fans. The breeze caused all manner of problems for both full-backs, and it was Bruce Reihana's spilling of a high ball that led to Bath's decisive second try. The mistake invited pressure, and after five minutes of Bath play on the Saints try-line Claassens decided to go for broke himself and stepped deftly through a gap to put the home side 18\u20139 up. His second try, in the 74th minute, came from another snappy break, this time around the blindside of a scrum for a touchdown in the far corner. Meehan preferred to laud the \"good, tight, work\" of his forwards but Northampton's director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, was quick to pick Claassens out as the difference between the two teams. \"He did excellently,\" said Mallinder, \"Bath's half-backs really kept them in the game. That said, we really need to look at our defence and work on the fine details. If you look at all three tries we were at fault, particularly the first.\" Northampton have not won away from home in the Premiership this season, but they had several good opportunities to end that hoodoo on Saturday. Their obvious power advantage in the front row was too easily negated by some shrewd scrummaging by David Flatman, and they lacked the conviction to take their chances. \"It is very disappointing to come away with nothing,\" Mallinder said ruefully, \"because we played a lot of good rugby.\" Indeed they did, and Bath were forced to work hard for the win. The play-off structure of the Premiership may have devalued the satisfaction Bath can take from being league leaders, but at the end of the season it will not be the points they won in this match that matter so much as the ugly style in which the result was achieved.
