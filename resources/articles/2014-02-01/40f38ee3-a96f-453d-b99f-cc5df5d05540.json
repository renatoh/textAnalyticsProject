Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes nine and ten of the second season. Read Stuart Jeffries' blog for episodes seven and eight Oh dear. And I thought Pernille was going to have a lovely flingette with Martin after Mette told him she didn't love him any more. But no. The Bridge doesn't roll that way. It's not quite unremittingly bleak, but these superb two final episodes can't have done much for the Malm\u00f6 or Copenhagen tourist industries. The glowering grey exteriors, the bleached-out interiors, the body count, the corruption, betrayal, lies and vilely virtuosic viral murders all made for superb TV. But as for a city break, I'll stick with Bruges or Bath. Instead of finding love and losing her fingers in Martin's luxuriant chest hair, Pernille wound up shooting herself in the head in a Copenhagen toilet to elude the more lingering death into which she was sliding thanks to the fatal virus dispatched by a human biological weapon. We've all been there, right? Of course we haven't. But what would you do in those circumstances? You're going to die: better by your own hand and fast, or would you prefer to let the virus carry you off more slowly and painfully? Women taking their own lives to elude the misery of a lingering death is becoming quite a TV theme this January what with Hayley Cropper on Coronation Street and now Pernille erasing herself from the possibility of a starring role in season three. Coincidence? Or do we like to see women rather than men put through the existential wringer in TV dramas? Probably the former, but you never know. Let's hear it, incidentally, for the unwitting human biological weapon as dramatic device: the Chandlerian trope of a guy walking into the room with a gun to move the story along, or Brody strapped with explosives in a sub-al-Qaida terrorist plot at a vice-presidential summit in Homeland. Both of these seem dramatically impoverished in comparison to what Gertrud did to her sister-in-law Viktoria, and its multiple ethical ramifications. Did you see Gertrud Kofoed as the evil chemistry genius with a crazy environmental agenda (essentially, kill off all the EU ministers who've been stonewalling on climate change policies and replace them \u2013 somehow! \u2013 with new ministers who will take effective action) rather than a wronged woman whose husband gets off on watching his sister taking a bath using the CCTV system he furtively installed in her home? Me neither. But evil genius she was. So when Gertrud clubbed Oliver with the table lamp to stop him killing Viktoria, it wasn't a humane action that had the perhaps unintended consequence of killing him; rather, she was protecting her timebomb, whom she needed to attend that EU summit so her nefarious scheme could achieve maximum nefariousness. Of course, Gertrud's plan didn't succeed because Viktoria and Pernille were sealed off in the toilets by quick-thinking cops (Malm\u00f6's finest, Saga Nor\u00e9n, principally). The targeted EU ministers, I couldn't help thinking, might have included our very own secretary of state for energy and climate change Ed Davey. But Davey, to my mind, should face the electors next year rather than being murdered by a Danish human biological weapon. Perhaps those of you who aren't Liberal Democrats disagree. But here's the twist. Gertrud got her comeuppance even as she made her triumphalist video explaining why she'd murdered all those ministers. Some guy, presumably Gertrud's even more nefarious boss, plugged her because her minister-slaying didn't come off as planned and she was now a liability. But who was that man? Who shot Gertrud? The image of Gertrud's killer was blurry, but am I alone in thinking it looked like the outline of Chris O'Dowd from The IT Crowd and Bridesmaids who \u2013 big respect to Chris! \u2013 has learned idiomatic Danish for the scene? Probably I'm wrong about that. I've been wrong about a lot in this series, so I see no reason to change tack now. But who could the killer be? Bee-keeping shipping magnate Marcus Stenberg? Mysterious Lennart Blomgren, who's come back from his unexplained post-fake death exile in Thailand to administer the coup de gr\u00e2ce to Gertrud, the woman who replaced him as head of research at Medisonus? Probably a bit far-fetched. Or Rasmus, the baby-faced twerp of a cop who's lost the ethical plot? Again, fanciful. Most likely, it's somebody we haven't seen before played by an actor we've seen in several Scandi dramas already (there being only 10 adult male actors in Denmark and a similar number in Sweden, all of whom rotate roles on Borgen and Wallander). And my hunch is they'll show up in season three and, fingers crossed, Saga will take them down. Saga and Martin redux But forget about the eco-terrorist conspiracy, the bafflingly complex police investigation and, you know, the whole future of the planet thing. That's all incidental to the main story, which is the psychodrama of our odd couple cops. Here is the finale's unbearable dramatic twist: their friendship, based on opposites attracting, collapsed in mutual betrayal. Martin betrayed Saga by digging into her family history; she betrayed him because, perhaps, professional duty is a greater thing than personal loyalty in her book. And, even though he wound up getting arrested for the murder of Jens thanks to Saga dobbing him in to her Danish colleagues, really she's the one who is destined to suffer as she stands alone in the rain. What happened to them? Martin pulled the file on her dead sister and found out something Saga had wanted buried. Not just her hideous family past (a mother with M\u00fcnchausen by proxy who tried to kill Saga's sister), but Saga's own culpability in the tragic circumstances of her sister's death. We don't quite know what Saga did all those years ago but we know that, by her admission, it was criminal. And, we may infer, that criminal act went unpunished by law, but has tormented her ever since. Can you imagine what she did? But even if Martin sticking his head unsought in to the Nor\u00e9n family dirty laundry was unconscionable to Saga and amounted to a betrayal of their friendship, were we to take it that her betrayal of him to the cops for killing Jens was revenge for his intrusion into her private past? The script didn't rule out that interpretation, but more likely this was a question of Saga, the good cop, doing what she thought was the right thing even if it added to the world's suffering \u2013 and, in particular, her own. This storyline was, I thought, superbly handled. \"Are you sure I did it?\" Martin asked Saga. \"You know I do,\" she replied. But even then we weren't quite sure she would act on that knowledge. Until, that is, she told her boss Hans: \"I think I know how Jens died.\" NOOOO! I howled at the TV. Don't do it, Saga, don't betray your only friend for a crime that scarcely calls for punishment. But she did. Again, what would you have done? I predict at least 93.5% of you will say that you wouldn't have betrayed Martin. But we all know how reliable my predictions have been in the past few weeks. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Fulfilling one of my few correct predictions, Jakob left Saga. And he also lost his facial hair, which was nice. \u2022 I liked the Dr Evil-like final words of Oliver to Viktoria before he tried to suffocate her with that go-to Danish murder weapon, a designer pillow: \"My finale will make you immortal. You're going to save Europe.\" Who wouldn't want to club him with a high-end minimalist Scandinavian table lamp for that? \u2022 Detective Rasmus went rogue, though the script lost interest in his jejune, embittered plot to derail the superb Saga and her investigation early in the finale, which was understandable. He's such a jerk. How he got through the detective selection process is anybody's guess. My thought is that the interviewing panel were charmed by the notion he looks perfect to play keyboards in Abba Juniors. \u2022 If you have to give a keynote EU summit address, here's a tip: wear the dress Viktoria wore. What a superb dress! Just a shame she died in agony before she got to the lectern to give her (probably) stupefying address. \u2022 But I'd happily bulldoze Viktoria's unlivable white cube house. It looks like a padded cell with huge privacy-eliminating windows; don't Danish architects realise the panopticon penitentiary vibe is so 19th century? \u2022 The winner of most boring placard slogan at an EU climate summit protest is ... \"Act now!\" No wonder the planet is screwed. \u2022 And the winner of the most risibly fascistic police instruction at an EU summit menaced by an airborne virus goes to: \"Clear the building! Ministers first!\" Not women and children, but ministers. Sheez. \u2022 The word is that season three is already being written by head writer Hans Rosenfeldt and that Detective Martin Rohde is to be a lead character. But how? Isn't he in the slammer for offing Jens? Can't wait to find out how they resolve that. Can't wait, in fact, for Saga and Martin to renew their partnership. \u2022 And finally: thanks, readers, for sticking with this blog through five late Saturday nights, despite my hopeless inferences, lame predictions and lamer gags. Really enjoyed your company. Yes, even you, despite that hurtful thing you said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
