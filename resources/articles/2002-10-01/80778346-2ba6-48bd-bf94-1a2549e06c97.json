In July 2000, I forecast that Blair would call the referendum - as he had promised in the election manifesto - in November 2001, and win it, just. My forecast was based on the nearly half of the British population who say either (split equally) \"I am generally in favour of British entry into the single European currency, but I could be persuaded to vote against it if I thought it was in Britain's economic interests to do so,\" or \"I am generally opposed to British entry into the single european currency, but I could be persuaded to vote for it if I thought it was in Britain's economic interests to do so\". I thought that with the concerted support of the prime minister and the chancellor, big business and the City, the major trade unions and both the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, joined by the \"big beasts\" of the Conservative party, Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine, a sufficient number of voters could be persuaded to learn to love the euro. But the outcome of the last election means that there is no pressure on the prime minister to do anything. The Liberal Democrats are marginalised; the Conservatives cannot choose an electable leader. The only dangers on the horizon for the prime minister are joining the Americans in a war with Iraq without UN support and losing it, or calling a referendum on the euro and losing that. Losing a euro referendum would destroy the credibility of Tony Blair's government in the same way that Black Wednesday destroyed John Major's government. Why risk it before the next election? It is true that important decisions about the management of the currency and the EU economy will be taken in the next couple of years and Britain will be excluded from them. Yet other big euro countries want Britain to join, so they are unlikely to take decisions that will make entry harder. Indeed, the signs are that European politicians, if not central bankers, want to shift the management of the euro to something rather closer to Gordon Brown's system for managing sterling. Pollsters measure people's behaviour, their knowledge and their views. Their views can be further sub-divided into three levels. The first is people's opinions, the \"ripples on the surface of the public consciousness\", easily blown about by political winds and the media. Below the surface are attitudes, things which people have thought about, discussed and care about. Attitudes are not so easily shifted. You must present persuasive argument to change them, and the arguments must come from someone the hearer respects. Deeper still are the tides of the public's view which we call values (things like belief in God, the death penalty, euthanasia). Values change very slowly, if at all. Opinion polls are unlikely to produce the same results as referendums. Polls are here today, gone tomorrow. When an interviewer asks you some questions, you do not feel an obligation to think carefully about them. The media will not have covered the questions in advance. You are just courteous enough to answer. Referendums are more considered. At the end of a four-week campaign, people know what is at issue, and those who cast their vote have thought about it. It is not sprung on them. Bearing in mind that qualification, what can opinion polls tell us about views on the euro? First, the broader identity issue. Three people in four, 75%, of the British public say they feel strongly that they belong to their local community; 78% say they feel strongly about England or Scotland or Wales, and 84% say they feel strongly that they belong to Britain. However, only 35% say they feel strongly that they are Europeans. Every two months we ask: if there were a referendum now on whether Britain should be part of the euro, how would you vote? We also ask a second question - how would you vote if the government really put its back into winning the referendum? (The latter makes about a three-point difference to the result; it narrows it, but nothing like as much as it did in the 1975 EEC referendum.) A four-part question is put to people, which enables us to gauge strength of feeling and assess likelihood of voting. It is: \"Which of the following best describes your own view of British participation in the single currency? \"I strongly support British participation\"; \"I am generally in favour of British participation, but could be persuaded against it if I thought it would be bad for the British economy\"; \"I am generally opposed to British participation, but could be persuaded to vote in favour of it if I thought it would be good for the British economy\"; and \"I strongly oppose British participation.\" The figures are these: some 19% are solidly in favour, so the euro supporters need to add 32% minimum to achieve a majority at a referendum. There are 24% leaning to the \"yes\" vote so, to win the referendum, the euro supporters must get their 19% to the polls, plus the 24% leaning to \"yes\" and then convince nearly half those leaning against to shift their vote. A tough hill to climb. On the other side, the 29% who strongly oppose Britain joining the single currency need only to ensure that the 22% leaning towards them get out to vote and they have won. The lower the turnout, the more important the 10-point advantage for the no vote. Elite opinion will make some difference during a referendum campaign, but it is more divided than in 1975 and voters are less inclined to defer to it. Big business opinion is, in any case, ambivalent. Mori interviewed 187 senior board directors of Britain's leading companies between September 5 and November 12 2001. Following a decline over the previous three years, belief in the value of the euro to Britain has risen again, but business leaders support joining by only around three to two. The introduction of euro notes and coins on January 1 went better than the most ardent europhile could have hoped. But it made no difference to public opinion. And, despite the continuing Labour lead in the polls, mid-term blues are setting in; a euro referendum in 2003 would end up being a referendum on the government, as it was in France when they voted on Maastricht. That is why I believe there will not be a referendum until after the next Labour victory, in May 2005. And the result, when it does come (perhaps in spring 2006)? Most likely a narrow win for entry - that, at any rate, is what a majority of the British public believe will happen, even while opposing that outcome. Britons have yet to be convinced of the economic benefits. In a survey last July, a majority said they thought the euro would not create more jobs, would not result in lower inflation and would not create faster economic growth, whereas they thought it would cause Britain to \"lose control over its economic policy\" and to \"lose too much of its identity\". While only a third expect to see a United States of Europe by 2010, more than half, 57%, expect a US of E by 2050. Only 17% of the British said they supported \"a United States of Europe with a federal government\" in 1994 and 18% in 1998, but omitting the words \"federal government\" almost doubles support, to 34%, according to a Mori survey for the Sun in October 1997. It may not be here tomorrow, but it is on the way. Bob Worcester is chairman of Mori International.
