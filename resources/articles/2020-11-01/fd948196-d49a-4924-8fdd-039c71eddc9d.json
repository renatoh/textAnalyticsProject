On Tuesday, Parramatta\u2019s main thoroughfare will close temporarily from midday, to make way for a protest march to save Willow Grove, an 1890s villa that sits at the centre of the site selected by the state government to house one of the country\u2019s largest museums. Two of the state\u2019s largest unions \u2013 the NSW arm of the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) and the NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association \u2013 have placed a green ban on the house, effectively preventing its demolition. The issue has also caused bitter division among the City of Parramatta\u2019s councillors, with last week\u2019s meeting deteriorating into a shouting match during debate over whether council should support a motion in favour of the NSW government\u2019s response to the EIS\u2019s submissions, which recommends the building\u2019s removal from its existing site. The council ultimately voted to support it. In a report prepared by a major accountancy firm at the behest of the state government to convince the unions to lift the green ban, the relocation site for the historic building is revealed. In the confidential report seen by Guardian Australia, it\u2019s confirmed Willow Grove will be dismantled brick by brick and rebuilt directly opposite old Parramatta Gaol. Representatives from the Dharug community, recognised by the state government as the traditional owners of the area, who have strong historical ties to both the house and the land it sits upon, have also condemned the relocation site. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to take something that is so meaningful to the Dharug people and relocate it into a colonial setting, into a place with such a dark history of violence and Indigenous incarceration,\u201d said Richie Howitt, a director of the Dharug Strategic Management Group, which sits on Powerhouse Parramatta\u2019s community reference group. The report said the relocated Willow Grove would have \u201cstrong connectivity with community and cultural activity\u201d and promised the CFMEU ten \u201copportunities to collaborate\u201d, including broadening the government\u2019s apprenticeship program to help deliver Powerhouse Parramatta and other NSW government projects. The CFMEU told the Guardian the report has not shifted their firm stance on the green ban, industrial action the union has not taken since the heritage row over Bondi Pavilion in 2016. The union\u2019s NSW construction secretary, Darren Greenfield, said the proposal to demolish Willow Grove and rebuild it in a different location \u201cwas absurd and completely unacceptable to the people of Parramatta and to the CFMEU\u201d. Greenfield said the dismantling of the building would inevitably result in the destruction of much if not all of the original materials. \u201cWhat will be rebuilt on a completely different location will not be Willow Grove \u2013 it will be a copy ... and a poor copy at that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community along with heritage experts and the CFMEU do not accept this as saving our heritage.\u201d Arts minister Don Harwin said Willow Grove\u2019s relocation to a new site in North Parramatta would provide the community with better access while restoring the villa to its former glory. \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to the community tell us of their connection to Willow Grove,\u201d he said in a statement in October. \u201cWith this decision we will deliver vastly improved access to Willow Grove on a better site, and Western Sydney gets its long awaited and much deserved first cultural institution.\u201d In the same 8 October statement, the lord mayor of Parramatta, Bob Dwyer, said: \u201cRelocating Willow Grove and preserving it at a new site will provide an opportunity to breathe new life into this historic building, while still delivering a world-class cultural institution at an iconic location in Parramatta\u2019s CBD.\u201d On the same day, Powerhouse trustee David Borger told a NSW parliamentary inquiry that Willow Grove was not historically important enough to make it onto the state\u2019s heritage register. \u201cIt is not a particularly significant or unique building,\u201d he told the inquiry. \u201cIn fact, it is a pattern-book Victorian Italianate house that has had significant and substantial change.\u201d In late October, a NSW government spokesperson told the Guardian it would \u201ccontinue to consult with the Dharug Strategic Management Group as well as the many other community groups\u201d and it was \u201cfocused on delivering a heritage interpretation strategy that will honour the strong connection Indigenous communities have to Parramatta and Greater Sydney and honour heritage buildings\u201d. Last Monday\u2019s council meeting heard that the heritage issues surrounding Parramatta Powerhouse had become so controversial that the government had received more submissions to Infrastructure NSW\u2019s Environmental Impact Statement on the project than those combined for the similarly polarising Westconnex and Sydney Metro West. More than 90 percent of the more than 1,300 submissions raised \u201closs of heritage\u201d concerns over the demolition of St George\u2019s Terrace \u2013 a row of 1880s residences and shops \u2013 and/or the dismantling and relocation of Willow Grove a couple of kilometres north, to make way for the new museum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
