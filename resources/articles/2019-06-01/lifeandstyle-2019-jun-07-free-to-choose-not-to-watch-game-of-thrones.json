He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes, express an interest a little too solicitous.\u201d He seems to be playing a part, with a surfeit of enthusiasm. Why? To deceive himself, Sartre concludes. The waiter throws himself into the role because he wants to persuade himself he has no choice \u2013 that he\u2019s \u201csome kind of automaton\u201d, whose very essence condemns him to be a waiter. That\u2019s more comfortable than facing the truth, which is that he\u2019s choosing to be a waiter and is free to make a different choice \u2013 though you can\u2019t help wondering how Sartre, who basically lived in cafes, would have coped had the waiters of Paris all acted on his advice. I thought about Sartre\u2019s waiter the other day when I read an article in the magazine Fast Company, which offered tips on using meditation to cope with the stress arising from watching the closing episodes of Game Of Thrones. It\u2019s slightly mean to single it out, given that stories with gratuitous Westeros angles have been such a staple of the last eight years. Still, it seemed to capture something essential about life in 2019. Since you had to watch Game Of Thrones, the article implied, and since the final season had been so infuriating and/or emotionally draining, didn\u2019t it make perfect sense to find time in your schedule for a little calming meditation? To be sure, there was a more elegant solution to this problem: not watching Game Of Thrones. But, as with Sartre\u2019s waiter, the possibility of that choice didn\u2019t even seem to arise. In reality, I doubt many people felt truly obliged to watch Game Of Thrones. But most of us do make this error in some domain or other. Digital technology offers an obvious wealth of examples. We persuade ourselves that something is a non-negotiable aspect of modern life \u2013 being on Facebook, carrying a smartphone, being reachable on email at weekends, keeping up with the news \u2013 then figure out ways to deal with the downsides, rather than stopping to wonder if it\u2019s even necessary in the first place. The tricky part is that some things are obligatory: any given person\u2019s situation genuinely might oblige them to be (say) reachable at weekends or be on Facebook, or to work as a waiter when they would rather not. But the same economic forces that constrain our choices like this also want us to believe that our choices are more constrained than they really are. The truth is that, however little choice you have, you almost certainly have more than you believe. These days, were he to accuse a waiter of failing to appreciate the full range of his options, Sartre would be told to check his privilege, and fair enough. But it wouldn\u2019t follow that he was wrong. Maybe you actually don\u2019t need to keep doing the thing you tell yourself you have to keep doing. Maybe you could turn on your heel and walk out of the cafe, oblivious to the philosopher snapping his fingers for another espresso.
