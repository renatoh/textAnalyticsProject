Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes three and four \u2013 and please do not leave spoilers if you've seen further in the series. Catch up with Vicky Frost's episodes one and two blog here. No! Tintin! Lieutenant Fromentin is down, caught by a bullet in a shootout with jewel thieves. In good news, he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which could mean he could just be winded (copyright: a certain Scandi detective). In bad news, there was a lot of blood on the floor, which rather suggests otherwise. I'm hoping for a bloody but not fatal wound to a limb, but Laure's reaction suggests this might not end well. (I have everything crossed: sometimes Tintin is seemingly the only sensible police officer CID has.) We will return to this week's police goings-on below. But first a couple of thoughts sparked from last week's comments. There was an interesting conversation around the physicality of actors in Spiral \u2013 including a question of whether the show only really works if you fancy one of the six leading characters. I couldn't possibly comment \u2026 But I quite like it as a playful accusation: it's not as if the cast are representative of any population as a whole. Even les flics, who in general look like they could do with a good bath, are on the more attractive end of the scale. And then there's Pierre and Josephine who make quite the handsome couple ... But the people who make their most of physicality on screen are Laure \u2013 who has that lean, fidgety, nervous energy thing going on \u2013 and most particularly, Roban. Ah Monsieur le Juge, welcome back indeed. This was a return to screen to give the whole doublebill a massive lift. The way in which Philippe Duclos uses his spare, wiry physique as Fran\u00e7ois Roban is brilliant: long fingers gently prising the truth from those who come before him, sharp features twitching at a half truth, slight frame belying the heavyweight intellect and nose for a fight. It's first-rate stuff. So let's get stuck into discussing it below. There were some slightly bad-tempered exchanges last week \u2013 which is frustrating because the joy of these blogs is the quality of discussion in the comments. Please, we must respect each other's opinions and also our way of stating them whether flippant or deadly serious. Let's listen to each other and be welcoming. On which note: @MatthewCobb gave us a great insight into the bank raid last week. Not only did I miss the WWII significance of the shaved head/collaborator sign round the bank worker's neck (which @LCDance also discusses here) but also the significance of attacking the deportation centre, echoing the actions of Resistance groups during the war. Thanks to both. Les flics Is Herville a misogynist, or determined to divide and conquer, muses Laure. I'd hedge my bets and say both. He's certainly been busy sowing the seeds of discontent between Gilou and Laure \u2013 seeds that Capitaine Berthaud seems determined to weed and water, despite her righthand's man defence of his boss \u2013 while also throwing about references to \"les hormones\". What a charmer. Presumably Tintin's shooting will also have an impact here, either pushing officers Berthaud and Escoffier together or apart. Let's hope it's the latter. Although I fear Gilou could get used to being \"someone special\", not least while Amina is praising him so determinedly. That despite Gilou using a criminal with an electronic tag to illegally plant a tracker on a suspect's car and, of course, having got into bed with the Sarahouis, who are now going to expect Gilou to make good on his end of the deal. Elsewhere les blunders were also very much in evidence: Laure et al starting a riot outside the prison by pursuing Sophie through the crowd; losing Riffault with a rucksack full of incriminating evidence; losing Sophie and Riffault as they busted out of Police HQ of all places; stomping all over counterterrorism's operation. (Though they seemingly knew nothing about the lockup, or indeed the bombing target, so they can't have been that on the ball.) On the upside: Amina did not come face-to-face with Thomas and that nasty-looking iron bar. And we have the first bit of info re: Erkan. He drank his last caf\u00e9 at Cafe Soliman, where Tintin and Amina spy Umit \u00c7etin, a known Kurdish people smuggler. Les r\u00e9volutionnaires Or \"our gang of leftist toerags,\" as Gilou would have it. I'm not sure that Thomas's nutter status could be more thoroughly underlined \u2013 although just to make sure we got the message, he greeted Josephine naked and later launched himself at a departing Christophe, who had covered for the gang to the police, with some gusto. It's all a little bit overdone. I'm also not entirely sure I believe that the cell would have been able to stage the fire at the Pref\u00e9cture, or at least not with Sophie acting in such a ludicrously suspicious manner. In any case: wouldn't there be a backup of all these files somewhere? If only for forgetful civil servants to leave on trains/in pubs. With the squat presumably gone, and Christophe unlikely to align himself with breakaway cell, Thomas, Sophie and their silent friends (bit odd) are presumably likely to step things up a level. Question is, will Laure and her team be allowed to get involved? Les avocats What's this? Both Pierre and Jos\u00e9phine saying no to clients on matters of principle? Although Ms Karlsson finds herself persuaded to break the rules for honourable reasons, for once. An interesting two episodes for the partners and \u2013 if Jos\u00e9phine's sister wasn't jumping the gun \u2013 engaged couple. I know there are some who find the way the barrister is drawn as a super-sexy, evil queen a bit much really, although I did love that she turned up to her sister's wedding basically in that costume. But this week we saw a bit more of her: a few extra glimpses of her being thrown by situations and then regaining her hardened exterior; that argument with her estranged father, a judge, over his treatment of her mother; that urgent sexual encounter afterwards. I've always really enjoyed Audrey Fleurot's performance, and I like seeing some of her character's backstory. But I'm not entirely sure I want to see Jos\u00e9phine Karlsson \"healed\" by Pierre's love and made into a nicer woman. In any case, as Laure notes following Mr Cl\u00e9ment's rather brilliant peformance before Wagner: \"You're starting to think like her.\" Is it wrong that I rather hope so? Monsieur Juge Roban's back, and within a mere few minutes has both outwitted and pissed-off the higher-ups. I fear not even he will be able to weather the storms almost certain to come his way. The first of which concerns Raulic, a burglar accused of three rapes currently on hunger strike. Despite his brilliantly cutting line: \"Tell him to eat. It's irritating when rapists play the martyr card,\" Roban has his doubts. Suspiciously, there are large holes in the case file \u2013 an unrecorded alibi appears to hold up, for instance \u2013 and I suspect we will find political reasons behind Raulic's possible framing. Certainly, if there's anything to uncover Roban will unearth it. He's like a reasonable terrier, if such a thing existed. And he seems particularly uncowed by the events of season three \u2026 Notes, quotes and observations. \u2022 Those references to \"Police HQ\" when it came to the anarchist attack, refer to the pref\u00e9cture, which also deals with administrative issues such as work permits and residency. \u2022 I must apologise for making JP into PJ last week (insert your own Byker Grove joke). In any case, Gilou's now bullied him into leaving. \u2022 Vincent asks Laure to move in: \"This would be a good time to look delighted. Even a polite smile would be nice.\" \u2022 I liked the idea of the anarchists all lining up nicely to buy their Metro tickets for the riot. \u2022 \"So you have a man who hopefully won't change his jacket. What is this, Keystone Cops?\". I'd warrant that Keystone Cops could only dream of Spiral-level blunders. \u2022 \"I have a sister, a family even.\" Such a great line \u2013 I, too, presumed Jos\u00e9phine had neither. \u2022 Mme Jorkal looked almost comically expensive: massive shades, beautiful highlights, fur coat, high heels, lots of cream silk. \u2022 Interesting French language aside of the week: \"Ma\u00eetre\" is used for addressing lawyers, both male and female. There's no English equivalent. \u2022 Fascinating discussion last blog about whether the BBC sanitises the swearing somewhat, as compared to Netflix's subtitling. Thoughts from those who have watched both versions very welcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
