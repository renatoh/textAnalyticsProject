The United States men\u2019s national soccer team were using the Cleveland Browns\u2019 training facility during the 2019 Gold Cup, and the young midfielder decided to entertain his colleagues \u2013 and anyone else in eyeshot \u2013 by turning his hand to the sport of their NFL hosts. Passes were flung 50, 60 yards, with perfect spirals and textbook quarterback technique, from left to right, right to left. Increasing the difficulty level, McKennie would run in one direction and fire the ball back the other way. Next up: 50-yard field goals, no problem. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at him and thinking, \u2018This guy could easily have been an NFL athlete,\u2019\u201d says USMNT manager Gregg Berhalter, recalling the scene. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable athlete. He\u2019s messing around with the ball and the Cleveland guys from the Browns were there watching him as well. They were like, \u2018Oh my God, this is amazing.\u2019\u201d In the eyes of his coaches and teammates, those minutes of post-practice exertion exemplified McKennie \u2013 the athletic talent, the boundless energy, the natural inclination to entertain and the work ethic that combined to earn a dream move to Juventus, where he plays on loan from Schalke, at the age of 22. It was by a quirk of fate that the athletic gifts McKennie possesses came to be applied to football. When he was six, his father, John, a staff sergeant in the army, was due for a PCS \u2013 permanent change of station. One option considered was Alaska, but the family instead decided on Germany, and the Ramstein Air Base, around 10 miles outside Kaiserslautern. It was upon arriving there that McKennie was first introduced to football. He was taken to the local club, FC Ph\u00f6nix Otterbach, by his mother, Tina, who was looking for another activity to supplement the organised tag American football her active infant played on the base. He scored eight goals in his first game and was quickly moved up to play alongside the club\u2019s eight-year-olds. Knowing little about the sport he found himself excelling in, it wasn\u2019t until the USMNT came to town, for a friendly against Poland in Kaiserslautern in 2006, that the 7-year-old McKennie\u2019s eyes were opened to the world of possibilities football presented him. He met the stars of Bruce Arena\u2019s team, had his boots signed by Landon Donovan, and resolved to someday play for the USA. After three years in Germany, McKennie and his family returned to the States, his soccer obsession surviving the journey back across the Atlantic. He soon joined FC Dallas, blossoming into one of the country\u2019s finest box-to-box midfielders, earning regular US youth call-ups and helping the MLS club win the Soccer Development Academy national championship in 2015. McKennie rose through the US youth ranks, quickly. At under-19 level, coach Brad Friedel was so impressed that he pushed the then-18-year-old Dallas standout on to the under-20s. \u201cMy first impression was he\u2019s a player that has this endless energy in the middle of the field,\u201d says Tab Ramos, the US under-20s coach at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s a very powerful player. He\u2019s a relentless worker.\u201d At the same time, McKennie was pondering a decision which would shape the rest of his career. He\u2019d been offered a scholarship at the University of Virginia, and Dallas wanted to tie him down to a Homegrown Player contract. Then Schalke made their interest known, offering the chance to return to Germany test himself in the Bundesliga. \u201cHe was in my camp in California and at that point is when things were getting worked out,\u201d remembers Ramos. \u201cHe had come to me from Dallas but left for Germany from my camp. \u201cHe told me he had already lived in Germany and that it was easy for him because he already spoke German. He was waiting for that opportunity and when it came along I think he was ready.\u201d As part of their efforts to entice McKennie, Schalke had under-19s manager Norbert Elgert \u2013 a respected veteran coach who has helped develop the likes of Mesut Ozil, Manuel Neuer and Leroy Sane \u2013 to outline the club\u2019s plans for the American. And McKennie and his family were taken on a tour of the impressive, 62,000-capacity Veltins-Arena. \u201cThis is gonna be you one day,\u201d Tina McKennie said to her son as they stood at centre-field of the vast stadium. \u201cYeah, I hope,\u201d he replied. Upon his arrival in Gelsenkirchen, Schalke\u2019s industrial home city built on the grit and graft of its coal miners, McKennie\u2019s skills impressed, but it was his work ethic that most resonated with his new surroundings. \u201cWes radiates a great enjoyment of life, provides a lot of fun and positive atmosphere in the team,\u201d says Elgert. \u201cOn the other hand, when it really counts, he can immediately switch from fun to seriousness and focus fully on the match and on the practices.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the guy who\u2019s always dancing in the locker room before training or games but has the ability to switch it off when it\u2019s time to focus,\u201d adds Nick Taitigue, a 21-year-old American midfielder who roomed with McKennie before his move to Juventus. McKennie\u2019s maturity and dedication to his development saw him quickly outgrow youth football. Within nine months of his arrival in Germany, he was promoted to Schalke\u2019s first-team squad, making his debut in May 2017 before establishing himself as a regular senior starter the following season. In November that year, he fulfilled a dream 12 years in the making, following in the footsteps of Landon Donovan and the other USMNT players he\u2019d met as a star-struck 7-year-old with a full international debut in a friendly against Portugal. His bustling arrival into the penalty area and cool finish in the 20th minute made him the third-youngest debuting scorer for the US. And even at international level, the work rate that had endeared him to Schalke fans and coaches alike stood out. \u201cWeston has so much energy,\u201d says Berhalter. \u201cTraining is never done for him. He\u2019s always the last one off the training field.\u201d Schalke were Bundesliga runners-up in 2017-18, but player sales and mismanagement meant they struggled for much of McKennie\u2019s time in the first team. Through the club\u2019s turmoil, the American emerged as a leader. At international level, his energy, commitment and the gravity of his personality have made him a respected figurehead for this emerging generation of gifted young US players. As his profile has increased, McKennie has strived to lead and inspire off the pitch, too. Similar to Manchester United star Marcus Rashford\u2019s work to battle food poverty in the UK, McKennie and international teammates Tyler Adams and Christian Pulisic came together to support Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the States. And the 22-year-old has been one of football\u2019s strongest voices in the campaign against social injustice, sporting an arm band emblazoned with the words \u2018Justice for George\u2019 in May, in reference to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, and he has been open in his criticism of Donald Trump. \u201cI think it is a very sensitive topic for him and I\u2019m proud of him for advocating for what he believes in,\u201d says Taitigue. \u201cNot everyone will speak up, especially with a bigger platform, so I\u2019m happy that he stands up for what he believes in. Having stamped his mark on the field where, four years earlier, he\u2019d stood in wonder alongside his family as he weighed up his move to Germany, a departure from Schalke was expected in the summer of 2020. A move to the Premier League, those around McKennie thought, was the next logical step. Few, though \u2013 McKennie included \u2013 anticipated a switch to one of the true giants of the global game. Juventus\u2019 interest took him by surprise, and it was only as the move drew nearer that he allowed himself to believe it was really happening. \u201cWes was fascinated by the idea to take the next step in his development and career by practicing with football stars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Gianluigi Buffon, Paulo Dybala and so on,\u201d says Elgert. \u201cWhen a coach like [Andrea] Pirlo really wants you and thinks you can make an impact in his team, it\u2019s very difficult to say no to that,\u201d adds Berhalter, who likens McKennie stylistically to Liverpool\u2019s Georginio Wijnaldum and thus expected him to join a Premier League side. \u201cJuventus is a top club in the world.\u201d Even given his natural athletic talent and early promise with a ball at his feet, McKennie, at age 22 and playing for one of football\u2019s greatest clubs, has over-achieved. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those players you don\u2019t see as having a weakness, because every day he comes to work and he comes to work hard,\u201d says Ramos. \u201cEvery day he makes the team better. Every day he\u2019s improving.\u201d McKennie\u2019s story is one of potential fulfilled through opportunities grasped, a little serendipity and, above all else, sheer force of work and will. He stands as the embodiment of the possibilities laid out before the young US starlets he leads, the American dream realized in Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
