When Kyle Walker steered home an 87th-minute winner the champions had finally broken down fiercely resistant opponents, having been behind to the south-coast side until the 70th minute. At that point the visitors\u2019 riposte to their 9-0 humbling by Leicester the last time out in the league appeared to be a shock victory over Pep Guardiola\u2019s team. James Ward-Prowse\u2019s 13th-minute strike, from an Ederson howler, had been protected admirably for nearly an hour as City hogged the ball yet could find no way through. But then Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s volley from Walker\u2019s cross gave the Argentinian a 13th goal of the season and the right-back\u2019s late winner meant all three points were taken. Guardiola was left pleased at his team\u2019s tenacity against opponents who had lost 3-1 at the same venue in midweek. \u201cWe were patient but aggressive in all the actions \u2013 the corners, the throw-ins,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe rhythm was high from the first minute. Big compliment for the team. It was not easy but we did it.\u201d Guardiola was reminded of how Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side had been humiliated by Leicester. \u201cFootball players have pride,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to live that again. It is our job to try and attack them. \u201cI knew it in the Carabao Cup. Our big problem in the last two games is one team who suffer with their own pride and they are not going to accept under any circumstances what happened against Leicester again. After the goal we conceded it is more difficult.\u201d City began the afternoon imperiously. Raheem Sterling\u2019s instant control was followed by him moving inside. Ag\u00fcero let fly a header. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan sought to play David Silva in with chipped balls along the left. Kevin De Bruyne smacked a shot at Jack Stephens. The next time one was fired the visitors scored, though, from a simple move. Nathan Redmond fed Stuart Armstrong, who took aim from 20 yards. Ederson fumbled \u2013 a rare error from him \u2013 and Ward\u2011Prowse finished. Guardiola saw what he would wish in response: City continuing to probe along the channels and across the Southampton \u2018D\u2019. The two Silvas \u2013 David and Bernardo \u2013 had efforts repelled by a Saints body. Here was a relentless blue wave that would surely engulf Southampton. But no. Soon Guardiola was berating Angeli\u00f1o for holding too deep a position and G\u00fcndogan for hesitating in possession. City ended the half facing a wall of black\u2011and\u2011yellow shirts that proved impossible to breach. Guardiola walked off at the interval maybe debating a change for the second half. When it commenced he had \u2013 Gabriel Jesus on for the injured David Silva. The issue remained the same, though: could City turn all the ball they enjoyed into an equaliser? Jesus operated alongside Ag\u00fcero in what was a front four, Bernardo Silva and Sterling completing the quartet. City\u2019s effort was admirable, their devilry lacking. When Guardiola raced to retrieve the ball for a Southampton throw-in an hour had not yet gone, so his franticness seemed premature. The manager\u2019s mood was reflected in him kicking a bottle of water and darkened further when a Silva cross landed sweetly on Ag\u00fcero\u2019s head only for the striker to miss. The City No 10 did not do so on 70 minutes. Walker pulled the ball back and Ag\u00fcero\u2019s volley beat Alex McCarthy through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. Now came City\u2019s grandstand finish, culminating in Walker\u2019s goal from seven or eight yards after McCarthy had mishandled an Angeli\u00f1o cross. The scorer showed composure considering the stage of the match and what was at stake \u2013 and the result might have been even better for City if not for Liverpool\u2019s later show in coming from behind to win at Aston Villa. \u201cWhen we win, Liverpool still win,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWhen they win many games in the last minute, it is because of special character. The first season we won the treble, we won four or five games in the last minute.\u201d He had ended the game infuriated at the officiating, causing Hasenh\u00fcttl to offer a telling observation. \u201cWe have seen him be a little bit nicer than today,\u201d said the Austrian. \u201cThe reason \u2013 because he was a little bit nervous because he could lose this game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
