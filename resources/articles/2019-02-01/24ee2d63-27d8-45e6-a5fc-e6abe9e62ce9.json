Ed Aarons was there. Ivan Cavaleiro scored the odd goal of five as Wolves finally got the better of Shrewsbury Town. Paul Wilson was there. Ben Fisher braved the rain at Rodney Parade to see Newport book a fifth round tie at home to the Premier League champions. League One strugglers Shrewsbury Town did themselves proud at Molineux, but the class and quality of Wolves saw them through to the fifth round. Matt Doherty scored two and created a third, to earn his side a trip to Bristol City. Barnet\u2019s whiteknuckle FA Cup run is over, while Brentford have earned themselves a trip to play Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. They\u2019re still playing at Griffin Park and Molineux. Brentford are 3-1 ahead against Barnet, while Wolves are hanging in there against Shrewsbury with three minutes of added time to play. It\u2019s Wolves 3-2 Shrewsbury. More good news from Joe Day: Joe Day, who missed the first game against Boro because his wife was due to give birth to twins, ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle. While the kids decided to stay put that time, Mrs Day has apparently gone into labour during this game and Joe is rushing off to the hospital to be with her. Here\u2019s hoping he has time to grab a quick shower before he gets to the maternity ward. Steve McClaren\u2019s Championship side saw off League One opposition in Portsmouth courtesy of goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith. They will host Watford in the next round. Sensational goals from Robbie Willmott and Padriag Ammond won the replay for Newport, who will entertain Premier League champions Manchester City in the fifth round. Deep into added time at Rodney Parade: Newport\u2019s fans are singing in the rain as their heroes run down the clock out on the quagmire that is the football match. They\u2019ve humbled Middlesbrough tonight and on the touchline, Tony Pulis is looking very displeased indeed. Newport County made the thick end of \u00a31m from their Cup run last season and look set to earn even more tonight. Back at Rodney Parade: Considering the conditions they have had to deal with \u2013 torrential rain and a cut-up morass of a pitch \u2013 Newport\u2019s performance against Middlesbrough tonight has been outstanding. They have bossed a team from two divisions above them for 81 minutes tonight, lead by two goals and could conceivably five or six goals ahead. Their defence has been stout and obdurate, while going forward they have been outstanding. Robbie Willmott has been outstanding, scoring a wonderful solo goal, while getting ball after ball into the penalty area. Up front, Jamille Matt and Padriag AMond have also been excellent. Remember, their reward for winning this game, assuming they hang on, will be a televised home tie against Manchester City. FA Cup latest Brentford 3-1 Barnet Newport County 2-0 Middlesbrough QPR 2-0 Portsmouth Wolves 3-2 Shrewsbury Town Non-league Barnet grab themselves a lifeline at Griffin Park courtesy of David Tutonda. Matt Smith doubles QPR\u2019s lead against Portsmouth, heading home a Luke Freeman free-kick. Brentford increase their lead and all but guarantee themselves a fifth round tie against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Ivan Cavaleiro gives Wolves the lead by the odd goal of five, shooting low past Steve Arnold after being released by Matt Doherty and cutting inside. QPR\u2019s superiority eventually yields dividends as Nahki Wells fires them ahead against Portsmouth. It\u2019s a scruffy goal from a corner, but they all count and he won\u2019t mind. Newport double their lead as they continue to pile the hurt on Middlesbrough. It\u2019s a brilliant goal from a set piece, with Padraig Ammond sprinting from back to a pocket of space at the front stick to turn on a sixpence and volley home the delivery from Robbie Willmott. A trademark Teddy Sheringham move, it was a brilliant delivery and a brilliant finish. There are over 20 minutes left, but Newport already look home and hosed, such has been their dominance. Another substitution for Middlesbrough: Britt Assombalonga is forced off with an injury and is replaced by Ashley Fletcher. Boro have lost both their forwards, which will not help their cause. The still trail by the only goal of the game. Meanwhile at Loftus Road: It remains scoreless between QPR and Portsmouth, but Nahki Wells and Massimo Luongo have both gone close for the home side, who are dominating their opposition from League One. A substitution at Rodney Parade: Middesbrough Jordan Hugill limps off with some manner of injury and is replaced by Rudy Gestede, whose existence, I must confess, I had completely forgotten about. Sorry Rudy. This just in from our man at Griffin Park ... This just in from Wolves v Shrewsbury Town: The half-time proposal takes big stones ... and not just the ones on the engagement ring. Luckily, this chap wasn\u2019t humiliated in front of a full house at Molineux. Newport County take the lead and it\u2019s no more than they deserve after dominating throughout the first half. Robbie Willmott picked up the ball in midfield and bore down on the Middlesbrough penalty area with the defence back-pedalling. Ignoring a run from Padraig Amond, he drops his shoulder and unleashes a shot from the edge of the area. In the Middlesbrough goal, Dimi got a hand to the ball but was unable to keep it out. Newport lead 1-0 at Rodney Parade. Brentford 2-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 2-2 Shrewsbury Town Matt Doherty scores his second of the night, heading Wolves level against Shrewsbury at Molineux. FA Cup half-times Brentford 2-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 1-2 Shrewsbury Town (still playing) League One outfit Shrewsbury have come from behind to take the lead at Molineux. It\u2019s a gaffe from John Ruddy, one of the fringe players brought in by Nuno tonight, that gifts the Shrews the lead. Josh Laurent took a speculative long range shot which the goalkeeper spilled and allowed to trickle over the line. Laurent\u2019s celebrations bordered on the sheepish, but those of the travelling Shrewsbury fans did not. Newport go close again: Robbie Wilmott is sending cross after cross into the Middlesbrough box, wreaking havoc in the process. His latest finds the head of Jamille Matt, who sends a header looping over the bar and onto the roof of the net. It remains 0-0 with four minutes of the half remaining. At Griffin Park, Julian Jeanvier has doubled Brentford\u2019s lead in a match which they\u2019re completely dominating. A Said Benrahma free-kick was curled in from deep and the defender fired home past Mark Cousins. How are Newport not winning? Getting on the end of a cross of a Robbie Willmott cross, Padriag Amond blindsides his marker and sends a bullet header from nine or 10 yards straight at Middlesbrough\u2019s goalkeeper. It was a fairly straightforward save in the end, but Amond really should have scored. Newport are completely bossing this game and should be three or four up by now. Tony Pulis hands a note to Adam Clayton: It seems to be quite a long one, written on a piece of A5 paper. It takes Clayton almost a minute to unfold and read, before he folds it up and tucks it into his sock. I have no idea what it says, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s something along the lines of \u201cYou\u2019re getting hammered by a team from League Two, managed by somebody who went to the same school as me. I was born and reared near here, so if you don\u2019t pull your fingers out, I will be embarrassed and you and your team-mates will be running laps all day tomorrow.\u201d Newport go close again: Jamille Matt leaps to try to get his head on a long ball from deep sent into the Boro penlaty area by Regan Poole. He fails to make contact and the ball drops by the far post, where Joss Labadie is following up, but fails to head home. With a little more savvy, he had a very straightforward tap-in there. There are 28 minutes gone at Rodney Parade and it\u2019s still scoreless, but Newport are on top. QPR 0-0 Portsmouth: QPR are on top at Loftus Road, where both Luke Freeman and Massimo Luongo have both shot wide. Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough: Padriag Amond brings a smart save out of Boro goalkeeper Dimi, volleying into the Greek\u2019s face and winning a corner from five or six yards. FA Cup latest scores Brentford 1-0 Barnet Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Wolves 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Shrewsbury equalise at Molineux, recovering from their early setback. Unmarked at a corner, James Bolton buries a powerful header after getting on the end of Oliver Norburn\u2019s corner. Middlesbrough go close: Jordfan Hugill hits the outside of the foot of the left upright with a low drive from distance. There are 17 minutes gone at Rodney Parade, where it remains scoreless and very wet. Back at Rodney Parade: It remains scoreless between Newport County and Boro, but the League Two side have been denied a penalty after Adam Clayton handled in his own penalty area. The Middlesbrough midfielder foolishley and deliberately controlled a ball into the box with his arm, but referee Stuart Attwell somehow missed it. From a subsequent corner, Newport\u2019s Jamille Matt should have scored from a narrow angle, but his shot-cum-cross was stopped by Jass Labadie on the line. At Griffin Park, Brentford have taken the lead against their non-League opponents, with Sergi Canos opening the scoring, converting from close range as a corner came his way. There\u2019s an early goal at Molineux, where Wolves have taken the lead against their League One opponents. Wolves have a corner cleared and Morgan Gibbs-White sends in a cross. The ball breaks for Matt Doherty who makes no mistake. 6 min: Playing in all white, Middlesbrough win a corner when George Friend puts the ball out of play off a Newport defender. The ball\u2019s played to Jonny Howson outside the Newport box and he unleashes a shot from distance. It sails wide, but not by much. Newport 0-0 Middlesbrough: They\u2019ve kicked off at Rodney Parade, where there\u2019s a lot of surface water on a pitch that has hosted over 60 rugby and football matches in the past year. It\u2019s a filthy night in Wales and the pitch is turning into a bog. In the evnt of any of our four Cup matches ending in draws tonight, there\u2019ll be extra time and possibly penalties. Not long now: Our fourth round replays are about to kick off and we\u2019ll be focussing mainly on Newport County v Middlesbrough, while keeping you up to date with the three other matches as they unfold. Weather report: It\u2019s chucking down with rain at Rodney Parade, where little puddles are forming on a very sodden pitch ahead of Newport County\u2019s match against Middlesbrough. I fancy the Welsh outfit to cause an upset here tonight. Newport County: Day, Butler, Demetriou, O\u2019Brien, Bennett, Poole, Bakinson, Labadie, Willmott, Matt, Amond. Subs: Townsend, Pipe, Forbes, Sheehan, Crofts, Dolan, Marsh-Brown. Middlesbrough: Dimi, McNair, Fry, Ayala, Flint, Friend, Clayton, Wing, Howson, Assombalonga, Hugill Subs: Lonergan, Besic, Downing, Tavernier, Van la Parra, Fletcher, Gestede QPR: Lumley, Furlong, Hall, Lynch, Bidwell, Freeman, Luongo, Scowen, Osayi-Samuel, Smith, Wells. Subs: Ingram, Kakay, Leistner, Manning, Wszolek, Eze, Hemed. Portsmouth: Macgillivray, Walkes, Burgess, Clarke, Brown, Naylor, May, Lowe, Close, Dennis, Hawkins. Subs: Bass, Haunstrup, Thompson, Evans, Morris, Pitman. Wolves: Ruddy, Doherty, Bennett, Coady, Boly, Jonny, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Cavaleiro, Costa, Traore.

Subs: Charles-Cooke, Edwards, Whalley, Amadi-Holloway, Sears, Rowland, Ward. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo makes six changes for the FA Cup fourth round replay with Shrewsbury. John Ruddy, Morgan GIbbs-White, Romain Saiss, Ivan Cavaleiro, Adama Traore and Helder Costa all start at Molineux. Former Wolves midfielder Dave Edwards has overcome a groin injury to make the bench for the Sky Bet League One visitors. Brentford: Daniels, Jeanvier, Sorensen, Dalsgaard, Odubajo, Sawyers, McEachran, Konsa, Canos, Maupay, Benrahma. Subs: Bentley, Watkins, Mokotjo, Da Silva, Ogbene, Barbet, Forss. Barnet: Cousins, Alexander, Sweeney, Johnson, Tutonda, Taylor, Robson, Fonguck, Mason-Clark, Coulthirst, Elito. Subs: Harrison, Sparkes, Matrevics, Akinola, Boucaud, Payne, Bettamer. Referee: Roger East (Wiltshire) Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo may field a few fringe players against tonight\u2019s League One opposition, in a move that could open him to criticism is his Premier League outfit gets beaten. With Wolves\u2019 Premier League status already secure and a fifth round tie against Bristol City awaiting the winners of tonight\u2019s match, the Midlands club have a glorious chance to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1960. Diogo Jota will definitely miss out after picking up a knock against Everton at the weekend, while Ruben Vinagre is also out with illness. Ruben Neves faces a late fitness test and may start on the bench, if at all. \u201cThey will come here, and for them it is a cup final,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cSo we expect a very tough game against a highly motivated team. We have to match them in that regard. I know it\u2019s going to almost be a full house, I\u2019m really glad for it because we\u2019re going to need their support.\u201d For the Shrews, Mat Sadler and Anthony Grant must sit this one out on the naughty step, while manager Sam Ricketts is cautiously optimistic Dave Edwards can return from injury to play some part in proceedings. Tomer Hemed has recovered from a hernia operation and may make tonight\u2019s match squad. Steve McClaren will have to make do without Angel Rangel and on-loan Geoff Cameron, who are both injured. \u201cI like the buzz that has been created and that is why I put great significance on the first game,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cWe had to get a result and make sure we got in the hat. We did that and that has given the winners Watford at home which is an extra incentive to play for. We\u2019ve none more so than to win. We want to go through in the Cup. As much for the supporters than anything, it\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere with plenty of fans.\u201d Portsmouth manager Kenny Jackett will be without the four signings he made last week, as none of the players concerned were at the club for the drawn game at Fratton Park. Dion Donohue is also out, while defender Jack Whatmough is a doubt. Joe Daly is back between the sticks for Newport, having missed the original match to be with his wife who was due to give birth to twins. Middlesbrough boss Tony Pulis is liklely to make changes to the side that beat West Brom by the odd goal of five on Saturday, as they line up for their fourth game in 12 days. \u201cI am not thinking about Man City one bit, not a chance,\u201d said Newport manager Michael Flynn. \u201cThis could end up like Bullseye - Bully\u2019s special prize, look what you could have won. You start getting carried away and you see the boat floating off, and you end up with a rubber dinghy. I have too much respect for Tony Pulis, too much respect for Middlesbrough Football Club, and that is all I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d We believe him, although thousands wouldn\u2019t. Brentford full-back Rico Henry has been ruled out of tonight\u2019s game after picking up an injury in his team\u2019s win over Blackburn on Saturday, while midfielders Lewis Macleod and Emiliano Marcondes are also out. Barnet have no such injury concerns going into this game, but their chairman Tony Kleanthous has announced that he and other Barnet officials will not be attending tonight\u2019s match as a protest over the allocation of tickets at Griffin Park. Brentford\u2019s ground has a capacity of 12,763 and Kleanthous is upset that Barnet have been allocated less than the maximum away allocation of 15%, which is 1,914. Brentford have cited health and safety reasons for only distributing 1,600 tickets to Barnet because the section reserved for visiting fans only hands a little over that number. As a consequence of all this, officials of Barnet FC have decided to give their boardroom tickets to the players\u2019 families and not to attend the boardroom of Brentford FC,\u201d said Kleanthous in a statement. \u201cThis is in order to show solidarity with our fans who will now miss out on this very special occasion.\u201d We have four FA Cup fourth round replays to keep tabs on tonight, all between teams from different divisions. Following their thriller at The Hive, Brentford and Barnet will resume battle at Griffin Park, where the only non-League side left in this year\u2019s competition hope to secure a fifth round home tie against Swansea. Meanwhile in Wales, a home tie against Manchester City is the reward for whoever prevails at Rodney Parade between League Two side Newport County and their Championship opponents Middlesbrough. At Loftus Road, Championship side QPR will be hoping to end a poor recent run of form when they entertain Portsmouth from the top end of the division below. And finally, at Molineux, Wolves take on Shrewsbury Town from League One, with a home tie against Watford in the next round up for grabs. All four games start at 7.45pm (GMT) and we\u2019ll provide news of all the goals as they go in, as well as other talking points. In the meantime, stay tuned for team news and build-up as we countdown to kick-off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
