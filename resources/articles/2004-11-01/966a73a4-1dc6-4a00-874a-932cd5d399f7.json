When the rebel leaders are dead, the insurgency in the rest of the country will wither away. But this is a dangerous assumption. History has shown that it is rarely possible to destroy an insurgency in one decisive military operation. The US argument that the insurgency is being led by foreign mercenaries and a hard core of Ba'athist thugs is not plausible ... \"There is evidence that most Sunni Muslims in Iraq are now either in revolt or sympathetic to the revolt. A brutal assault on the town of Falluja will only alienate them further.\" Tim Hames Times, November 8 \"The battle for Falluja is now the battle for Iraq ... The whole focus today is whether or not a relatively small band of well-armed extremists can impose anarchy on a nation. \"It is not, unfortunately, the case that if the terrorist network in Falluja is crushed, then bombings and killings across Iraq will stop in short order. To deprive Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his ilk of their base would, nevertheless, make life considerably more difficult for them. The sort of meticulous planning displayed in the atrocities at Samarra and Haditha would be hard to duplicate when forced to operate on the run. \"Further ... unless order is restored in places such as Falluja, then credible elections in Iraq in January may well be impossible. The victors in that contest can claim a mandate only if all parts of the Iraqi population are to participate in the ballot.\" Kuwait Times Editorial, November 8 \"The ... assault against Falluja is largely based on Washington and Baghdad's biggest concern in Iraq: the upcoming elections. For the elections to be considered successful, and for the outcome to lay the groundwork for a sovereign, democratic Iraq, largely rebel-held Falluja has to be reincorporated into the rest of the country ... \"If the US forces are successful in their assault, leaders throughout Iraq will probably do what they can to avoid such an attack against their cities and tribes. Launching an assault against Falluja has other tactical components. The city has become a way station for travelling insurgents and foreign fighters, as well as weapons, intelligence and other materials. By gaining control of Falluja, the US military can put a large dent in the supply lines of other insurgent cells 'downstream' in Baghdad.\" Herald Editorial, Glasgow, November 8 \"At times, it takes greater courage to show patience and restraint. So it is in Falluja. With Iraq's first elections due in January, the pressure on the US is increasing by the day and, predictably, it has succumbed to temptation. Instead of continuing the relatively successful policy of containment, US troops are to quell the 'city of mosques' with an all-out assault; the path towards democracy will be made to run smooth through the use of overwhelming force. That was made clear by Sergeant Major Carlton W Kent who in his crass battle-cry to the troops yesterday urged them to 'kick butt' and predicted another 'Hue City in the making'. It is an unfortunate comparison, considering the eventual outcome in Vietnam and the bloody offensive at Hue, and one that will do nothing to win the hearts and minds of Iraqis ... \"The US-led coalition would do better to listen to the voices of their critics who have long warned that violence begets violence.\" Daily Mail Daily Mail, November 8 \"If all goes according to plan, the insurgents will be routed in their most formidable stronghold. Stability of a kind could be restored, paving the way to January's elections ... \"But even with awesome American firepower, there have to be forebodings. When 100,000 civilians have already been killed in this war, doesn't it seem equally possible that this attack may worsen the shambles of the occupation and rouse Iraqis to greater hatred of the west? ... Meanwhile there are fears that hundreds of rebels may have slipped out of Falluja to regroup elsewhere. And thousands of shoulder-launched missiles have gone missing, on top of the [350 tonnes] of explosives that were supposedly under US control. The omens are not promising.\" New York Times Editorial, November 8 \"Present American force levels leave the army and marines too thinly stretched, and too worried about their own security to handle successfully all the challenges facing them. Besides the just-begun battle for Falluja, these include protecting the elections, guarding weapons sites and safeguarding efforts to rebuild Iraq's shattered infrastructure. Iraqi security forces are now being recruited and trained, but at this point their reliability is largely unknown. Other countries in George Bush's slim coalition are announcing departure dates for their troops, and few replacements are in sight. \"If Mr Bush feels he now has a mandate from the voters to stay the course until he creates a stable, unified Iraq, he owes it to the Iraqi people and Americans stationed there to commit enough additional troops to make that look like a plausible possibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
