The sight of the 18-year-old sending the Manchester City midfielder off course with a flick of the instep and evading his attempted recovery tackle to score a first Everton goal was therefore a significant step. It also underpinned Leighton Baines\u2019s theory of what makes \u201ca proper player\u201d. Baines was among the first to congratulate Davies and the debutant Ademola Lookman after the teenagers opened their Everton accounts in the 4-0 defeat of Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. The England international has been a mentor to his fellow Liverpool-born Evertonian since Davies graduated to the senior squad late last season and was unsurprised by the midfielder\u2019s impact against City. \u201cYou get some players who train well but flatter to deceive in a game because it can be a bit overwhelming and daunting as a young lad,\u201d Baines said. \u201cBut Tom is the opposite. He trains well but he finds another level when he gets out on the pitch and that is always the sign of a proper player. He\u2019s a lovely kid, a great player and he\u2019s Everton \u2013 he\u2019s one of the ones we\u2019ll all get behind.\u201d Davies\u2019s Everton credentials are well-established. A nephew of the 1970 title winner Alan Whittle, the teenager has told how he has taken inspiration from the championship medal he admires on visits to the former Everton forward\u2019s home. The same may apply to Whittle\u2019s haircut from his playing days, judging by the similarity. Davies joined Everton\u2019s under-11s from Tranmere Rovers \u2013 where his older brother Liam turned professional before being released last summer \u2013 and captained England under-17s at the 2015 World Cup in Chile, where his temperament and talent were noted by the Football Association\u2019s coaches. He was invited to train with the senior England squad in October of that year by Roy Hodgson, scoring twice in one session, and made his full Everton debut on the final day of last season when the caretaker manager David Unsworth deployed several of his under-23 charges against Norwich City. There was concern opportunities would be limited under Ronald Koeman, not least when the Everton manager said in early December that Davies, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Kieran Dowell and Jonjoe Kenny were \u201cnot ready\u201d for a consistent run at Premier League level. Impressive substitute appearances at Leicester City and Hull City over the festive period prompted a U-turn and starting roles in the 3-0 defeat of Southampton and the FA Cup exit against Claudio Ranieri\u2019s champions. City, and Tour\u00e9, were undoubtedly the biggest test so far of a player who signed a new five-year contract with Everton this season. Davies said: \u201cGoing into the game it was a test for me to see where I was as a player, coming up against him [Tour\u00e9]. What it has shown me is that if I keep working hard I can reach the level they are at. To beat Manchester City 4-0 is unbelievable, really. I would never have dreamed I would be in a game or in a team where Manchester City have been beaten 4-0. \u201cIt was a great boost to start. Then you see the substitutes getting ready to come on and you think it could be you but the manager left me on and I am thankful for that. It\u2019s good to have the new players in and the lads back around because it is great competition for the squad and that is what you need. Hopefully I can keep performing as I have done and keep my place.\u201d The Everton midfielder insists Koeman \u2013 who has also handed a full debut to Calvert-Lewin since expressing those doubts \u2013 has been instrumental in his development this season. \u201cHe speaks with me a lot, as does Erwin [Koeman, the assistant manager],\u201d Davies said. \u201cTogether they have helped me a lot and I think my game is improving because of them. Hopefully that continues and I can keep improving as a player. The first pass [that led to Romelu Lukaku\u2019s opener] is something I have been working on with my positioning, trying to be in the right position to make the passes. I can always improve and I will do that. \u201cThe manager told me to be aware of players running in behind me. With the players they have got, like Sterling, Ag\u00fcero, Silva and De Bruyne, they are always on your shoulder. It was something I had to be aware of and something I am working on. City could have really put us to the sword but, as a whole, the shape we kept as a team was very good and it showed by keeping a clean sheet. Afterwards the manager came into the dressing room and congratulated us as a team and he congratulated myself. He is always professional and he\u2019d want us to celebrate the result but then focus on the next game, which I think is key for us to keep the momentum going in the league.\u201d The grounded Davies planned to celebrate on Sunday by \u201cseeing what my mum and dad and my brother are up to\u201d and has no plans to roll his socks up, not in the sartorial sense at least. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. It\u2019s just how I have always played,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it but it is just the way I feel comfortable playing. I think that is the best way to be. If you feel comfortable and relaxed, then your game is going to be as good as it can be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
