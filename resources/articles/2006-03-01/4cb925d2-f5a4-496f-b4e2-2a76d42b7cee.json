It's an intriguing mix of North Africa, Oriental Islam and decaying imperial Mediterranean grandeur - with a hint of Classical Rome thrown in. Green Square (Assaha al-Khadrah) is at the centre, with the old walled city - the Medina - to the west, dominated by the Red Castle (As-Serai al-Hamra), which is home to the Antiquities Department and the National Museum. Modern Tripoli lies to the south and east. The city owes its importance to its position: the meeting point of three important Saharan caravan trade routes, from Sudan, Chad and Niger. It was only after the Arab conquest in the seventh century that the name Tripoli came into use, when the Arabs chose ancient Oea as their main centre. Virtually no Roman antiquities remain visible in the city today, but the ancient sites of Sabratha and Leptis Magna outside the city have been left virtually untouched for us to enjoy. The National Museum The impressive fortified Red Castle was long the centre of control for Tripoli's rulers, but today houses Tripoli's National Museum, a spectacular collection of Phoenician, Greek and Roman artefacts. Immediately inside is a fine Statue of Venus from the Hadrianic Baths at Leptis. Just opposite this is a complete Libyan-Roman tomb from the Ghirza region. And slightly out of step with the timeline, is a colourful Volkswagen Beetle, used by Colonel Gaddafi leading up to the revolution. The main collection is split into two sections - one for Leptis, the other for Sabratha. Models show how the crowded cities would have looked. The first floor features original carvings from the Arch of Septimius Severus at Leptis, with other rooms dedicated to later Roman and Byzantine rule. The second floor covers the Islamic period in Libya, while the third explores folkloric themes from around the country with traditional dress and household items. The fourth floor is dedicated to Libyan independence. The Old City (Medina) To enter the Medina through the main gateway from Green Square is to glimpse what it was like centuries ago. Since Roman times, the city has been rebuilt frequently; today most of the buildings date from the 16th century. These include mosques, souqs and caravanserais - the traditional stone buildings that house traders who continue to bring goods from the depths of the Sahara. The great thing about the Medina is that it's not so large as to get you lost, and whichever direction you take, you will soon find yourself back in the modern world. Mosques The Jama Ahmed Pasha Karamanli (Karamanli Mosque) is the largest mosque in the Medina, but this mid-18th-century domed building still retains an air of intimacy for worshippers who pray amid a forest of marble columns. The roots of the Karamanli dynasty that ruled Tripoli for over a century can be seen in the minaret and their tombs. There are plenty more mosques to be found while exploring the Medina's streets. The Jama an-Naga (Mosque of the She-Camel) has foundations said to belong to the first mosque in Tripoli and nearby, the small Sufi mosque with its minaret hanging out over the street is the Zawiat Sidi abd al-Qader. Close to these is the Jama al-Kharruba (Mosque of the Carob Tree), said to have been built on the site of the last carob tree, stripped bare by sufferers of the plague looking for its medicinal properties. Gurgi Mosque (Georgia Mosque) has a slender twin-balconied minaret that is the tallest in the Medina. The Jama ad-Draghut (Draghut Mosque), named after a notorious pirate and governor of Tripoli in the mid-16th century, is an extensive building containing a pillared prayer hall, a hammam (Turkish bath), tombs and two courtyards, and has a circular minaret. It belongs to an earlier Turkish style, which has been reconstructed after damage in the second world war. From here turn left for fine views of the fishing boats in the harbour. Along this waterfront is the Yahzarkom Arts Centre. The isolated white building on the right is the Sheikh Sidi Abdul Wahab Mosque, named after a holy man of the early 14th century who is buried there. Libyans making pilgrimage to Mecca traditionally say their final prayers here before leaving. Markets Straight ahead through the Medina's gateway, Souq al-Mushir (Marshal's Market) has glittering displays of gold and silverware, colourful bridal shops, and everything from miniature perfumes to giant suitcases, all of which stretches away to the Ottoman clock tower in the distance. Among the many markets in the Medina is the Souq al-Ghizdir (Copper Market), a hive of noisy activity producing metal plates, bowls, urns, trinkets, and the large crescents placed at the top of minarets. The Souq al-Attara (Spice Market), has many popular gold shops, and leads to the smaller Souq al-Siagha (Goldsmith's Market), and the restored Fonduq Bir Zekry, an old caravanserai resting place for overland traders, their animals and goods - now home to a busy teahouse. Souq al-Siagha has more gold and jewellery shops and if you continue along here, the entrance on the left leads to the covered textile souq, selling clothing and materials. Lifestyles of the old rich Close to the Medina's \"four Roman columns\" crossroads, where ancient columns have been reused on the corners of the buildings, is the famous Dar Karamanli (Yusuf Karamanli House), one of the homes built by wealthy families in this area around 200 years ago. The basic design of an open courtyard surrounded by colonnades and balconies is similar to some of the Roman villas excavated along the coast. Extra elements include the Arabic love of water, with a central fountain, and colourful Turkish tile-work on the lower walls. Inside the rooms are displays of traditional dress, period furniture, musical instruments and other items showing the wealth of this Turkish family. The Old French Consulate on the corner of the small street leading away from the arch is a restored building with central courtyard and colonnaded galleries dating from 1630. the Old British Consulate behind the Gurgi Mosque is another restored house, built in 1744 for the Karamanli family and offered to the British, who used it until the 1920s. There are wonderful views from the roof terrace across the Gurgi Mosque to the modern harbour. Just opposite is an old house called ad-Dar, recently converted into dining rooms, also with great views on a summer evening from the roof terrace. Ancient archway The Arch of Marcus Aurelius is the only substantial relic of Roman Oea and once welcomed visitors arriving at the old port. Dedicated to the co-emperors in AD163, today this heavy square archway of carved stone appears to be sunken, but this was the original level of the ground at the road junction of the Cardo and the Decumanus. The triumphal arch was a small part of the forum, and, intriguingly, undisturbed Roman ruins must lie buried at this level under most of the Medina. The story of the arch's survival is interesting, as it has been a storehouse, stable, public house, shop and even a cinema - essential establishments at various times over two millennia. The arch was once completely covered in marble, and carvings of the two deities of the city, Apollo and Minerva, can be still be seen. Some of the carved blocks on display around the edge of the arch are remains of a nearby Roman temple. \u00b7 Tomorrow we will explore the ancient sites that lie outside Tripoli - Leptis Magna and Sabratha. \u00b7 This is an edited extract from the new Berlitz Pocket Guide to Libya \u00a9 Berlitz Publishing"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
