How to prepare yourself for the hell of a self-catering kitchen", "bodyText": "In Switzerland, it is illegal to unload a stranger\u2019s dishwasher: it can be months before your vandalism has been made good and everything is where it belongs. No, sorry, that\u2019s wrong: in Switzerland it is illegal to keep one guinea pig without a cagemate. But the dishwasher thing should be illegal. The ordering of a kitchen is idiosyncratic and unguessable. There is no natural taxonomy to tell you where, for example, the grater should go (near the knives, or near the cheese?). There is no universally established list of things a kitchen should have, so that when you are away from home you can spend hours looking for a hand blender only to discover that these are considered, by unnatural people, to be non-essential, or give up after five minutes looking for a pestle and mortar, only to find a magnificent one of industrial size and high-quality stonework, stored on the third shelf behind the Tupperware. It doesn\u2019t usually matter, because you wouldn\u2019t cook in someone else\u2019s kitchen, unless you are related to them. Either that, or you have gone round to help a friend who is injured or has had a nervous breakdown, in which case, boil an egg. Prolonged exposure to a stranger\u2019s kitchen otherwise happens only on holiday, where it joins a constellation of stressors, including other people, and having been drunk since lunchtime. So that\u2019s something to look forward to this summer. British self-catering is the worst in the world. I can\u2019t prove that. But I\u2019ve been everywhere in the UK that is more idyllic than Lambeth \u2013 which is all of it, St Keverne to Pitlochry, Hunstanton to Anglesey \u2013 and I\u2019ve never met a kitchen knife sharper than David Davis. My friend\u2019s mum travels with a bread knife and an all-round kitchen slicer as a bare minimum, and everyone calls her Villanelle (before Killing Eve, they used to call her Scarface), until they\u2019re trying to make a tomato salad armed only with the art of persuasion. I would also, if I ever remembered, take a peeler: it is more common to find one that works but more troublesome if you don\u2019t. There\u2019s a level of uselessness that is actively insulting: the glass breadboard; the one-person cafetiere. There are items that would be innocuous as part of a well-stocked kitchenucopia \u2013 the fondue set, the Chinese basket steamer - which, in a place that doesn\u2019t have a bloody colander, look like a trolling operation. There\u2019s the world turned upside down \u2013 the electric hob with a gas oven. Hardly anyone really understands gas marks: they just stick everything on at six, for the very good reason that all gas marks are the same as six, except for eight, which is what you use to check the smoke alarm has batteries, and one, which is for farmers trying to resuscitate a barely-alive lamb. The electric hob, meanwhile \u2013 nothing\u2019s happening, no, still nothing, help it\u2019s on fire \u2013 is really fit only for boiling water. In a mysterious cupboard that you had assumed was the fusebox, you\u2019ll find everything essential: the corkscrew, the tin opener, the zester. (Ha! Only joking \u2013 you\u2019ll never find a zester.) In a large, well-placed cupboard that you would have used for core business \u2013 saucepans, sieves etc \u2013 you\u2019ll find stacks of bakeware you don\u2019t know how to use: it is not made of metal so you wouldn\u2019t want to use it for roasting or baking; often, it will have a decorative lemon painted on it with a high glaze, which may or may not be heatproof; or it\u2019s crenelated, or it\u2019s made of clay, or glass, and the only thing any of this was designed for is the thing that nobody makes \u2013 moussaka. In an eye-height cupboard that the rational world would use for cups and glasses, you\u2019ll find bad herbs: dried basil, powdered onion, Cajun mix. There\u2019s probably a make-your-own-cheese kit at the back. Do not make your own cheese. Looking for silver foil, you will eventually hit the miscellany drawer: honey spoons, sweetcorn stabbers, tiny good-for-nothing skewers, cocktail umbrellas, over-designed bottle openers, melon ballers. Immediately run towards your associates, shouting: \u201cI\u2019ve found cocktail umbrellas!\u201d It\u2019s good to get other people on to alternative tasks, otherwise they\u2019ll be hovering by your elbow the whole time, going: \u201cBut why are you so angry?\u201d You\u2019ll never find a user-friendly set of scales, but you may eventually find one of those contraptions with weights labelled in the smallest imaginable writing, and then have to summon a child to ask which one says \u201c200g\u201d. Measuring implements generally \u2013 jugs, spoons, cups \u2013 will be in very short supply. The subliminal message of the entire self-catering world is: \u201cWho wants to spend their holiday measuring things?\u201d To which the answer is: \u201cPeople who want to eat things.\u201d I\u2019d like to end on an upbeat note, floating some notion of the incredible resourcefulness embedded deep in all of us, and how you can astonish yourself crushing garlic with the heel of your hand. That is not true. The best thing about a stranger\u2019s kitchen is going back to your own kitchen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
