Having used a sat nav system in the car, it would be brilliant to have a little box guiding my route rather than dealing with a map. My question is: are all such systems programmed at the same level? The moorland roads we drove along are perfect cycling routes but the sat nav box could not see them. Lesley Close, via email There are systems for walkers, so there must be ones for cyclists, too. Numerous models claim to be \"portable\", but some don't have batteries and need to run off a car's juice. My brief survey dug up one promising item specifically designed for pedestrians and cyclists, which comes with a bar-mount. The Bluemedia 6300/6380 has rechargeable batteries and claims to have full street-level maps of the UK and Ireland as standard, down to the scale you will need. At \u00a3300, it's reasonably priced, as this kit goes; but check some product reviews online, because cheaper models sometimes have trouble \"seeing\" satellites. Visit a reputable dealer for advice before you buy."}, "isHosted": false}}}
