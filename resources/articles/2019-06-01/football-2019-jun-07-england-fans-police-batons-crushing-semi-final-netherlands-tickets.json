Fans also criticised police for failing to intervene when around 800 fans were penned by gates six and seven at the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques in Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 and then raising batons when asked for help. One England supporter, Tom Ambrose, who posted pictures of the incident on social media, accused the police of \u201cstanding back and allowing dangerous crushing\u201d. \u201cEveryone [was] soaked through, some stood for five hours,\u201d he added. \u201cKids in tears, women fainting. No violence, just panic. When people asked for help, police raised batons and sparked further crushes.\u201d Another England fan, Adam Coatham, said police had said the ticket scanners outside gates six and seven had failed. \u201cHaving arrived in a barely moving queue 45 minutes pre-game, gates were slammed shut 10 minutes pre-kick-off with thousands locked out,\u201d he said. \u201cRiot police then stormed in with batons. I tried to head to another gate but was shoved away by police.\u201d \u201cThere were no serious injuries, more by fortune than design,\u201d Coatham added. \u201cGates six and seven were utter gridlock and a mess. We arrived 45 minutes before kick-off so the usual \u2018arrived late\u2019 default response counts for nothing.\u201d A third fan, Thomas O\u2019Dea, said that the stadium was not equipped to cope with international football. \u201cGuimar\u00e3es is a lovely little stadium and a nice old-fashioned place but sadly isn\u2019t capable of hosting huge international games,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole electronic ticket system was a shambles. No surprise the gates got charged in the end.\u201d A Uefa spokesman confirmed there had been congestion and that police had \u201cintervened to maintain order\u201d before deciding to open the gates to let fans into the stadium. \u201cThe turnstile operation at certain parts of the stadium was slightly slower than anticipated and this \u2013 coupled with the late arrival of supporters at the stadium \u2013 led to congestion at some entrances,\u201d he said. \u201cAs fans started to push their way to the entrance, a dozen police officers briefly intervened to restore order. After assessing the situation, the police decided to open the turnstiles and let around 800 fans, who all had already undergone the initial ticket check, enter the stadium.\u201d Fans also reported problems with the late trains back from Guimar\u00e3es to Porto, with some queuing for hours to get back. As one put it: \u201cWhat a joke of an organisation Uefa is. We had to queue for just under three hours to get a train home in the rain. We were one of the lucky ones by the sounds of it. Town, station and stadium inadequate for such an occasion.\u201d The stadium hosted two matches at Euro 2004, both involving Italy. Police in D\u00fcsseldorf have detained 16 men following a brawl between English football fans. Officers were called on Thursday after \u201cabout 40 supporters of various British clubs\u201d began throwing chairs, tables, beer glasses and bottles at each other. D\u00fcsseldorf police say four people required medical treatment and the brawl caused \u201csignificant property damage\u201d. Police say the detained men, between the ages of 32 and 56, included supporters of Newcastle and Everton. None are residents of Germany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
