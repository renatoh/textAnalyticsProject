The company's business-to-business division, Emap Communications, said it had paid for the London-based DeHavilland Information Services in cash. Emap said the acquisition was expected to boost earnings in its first full year, and the business had \"exciting growth prospects\".

The company's crop of public sector magazines comprises Health Service Journal, Local Government Chronicle and Nursing Times. \"DeHavilland is a very high quality subscription information business which will be an excellent addition to our public sector business,\" said Derek Carter, the chief executive of Emap Communications. \"This is a good example of our strategy of bolt-on acquisitions for our B2B business.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
