In a statement, the Recording Academy said the change came \u201cas we continue to embrace a truly global mindset \u2026 Over the summer we held discussions with artists, ethnomusicologists, and linguists from around the world who determined that there was an opportunity to update the best world music album category toward a more relevant, modern, and inclusive term ... The change symbolises a departure from the connotations of colonialism, folk, and \u2018non-American\u2019 that the former term embodied while adapting to current listening trends and cultural evolution among the diverse communities it may represent.\u201d The term \u201cworld music\u201d was originally coined in the UK in 1987 to help market music from non-western artists. The Grammys created the best world music album category in 1992, with winners since including Ravi Shankar, Gilberto Gil and three-time recipient Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo. The term has fallen out of favour more widely in recent years. The Guardian stopped using it in July 2019, tagging articles about music from non-western countries instead with a more inclusive genre descriptor such as \u201cpop and rock\u201d or \u201celectronic music\u201d. Our world music album of the month column was, like the Grammys, renamed global album of the month. Guardian music critic Ammar Kalia reasoned that the change \u201cdoes not answer the valid complaints of the artists and record label founders who have been plagued by catch-all terms. Yet, in the glorious tyranny of endless internet-fuelled musical choice, marginalised music still needs championing and signposting in the west.\u201d UK music festival Womad has also stopped using the term. \u201cWe understand \u2018world music\u2019 is ghettoising for a lot of the artists,\u201d festival director Chris Smith told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re respectful of the term because it\u2019s our heritage, but we need to evolve it because the music has evolved.\u201d The Grammys\u2019 change is the latest in a number of alterations to the music industry\u2019s most prestigious awards ceremony. In June, the Recording Academy announced best urban contemporary album would be renamed best progressive R&amp;B album, as the term \u201curban\u201d is increasingly seen as inappropriate descriptor of Black music. Academy chairman Harvey Mason acknowledged \u201csome uncomfortable feelings\u201d around the term in the academy. Tyler, the Creator, who won best rap album at the 2020 Grammy awards, said: \u201cI don\u2019t like that \u2018urban\u2019 word. It\u2019s just a politically correct way to say the N-word to me\u201d, while Republic Records, home to Ariana Grande, the Weeknd and others, has stopped using the term. The academy does, however, continue to use the word \u201curban\u201d in the context of Latin awards, including the newly created best Latin pop or urban album award. Nominations for the 2021 Grammys will be announced on 24 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
