The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that the Australian government had issued 16 permits to arms manufacturers to export weapons or military technology to Mali in 2019. Mali has been in near-perpetual conflict for eight years. Last year, while Australia was approving the weapons sales, the UN warned that internal conflict was causing an \u201cunprecedented humanitarian crisis\u201d in Mali, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and putting millions of civilians at risk. Alioune Tine is currently monitoring the deteriorating human rights situation in Mali as the UN\u2019s independent expert. Just last month, Tine warned the multiple failures of the state \u2013 in administration, justice and security \u2013 were facilitating \u201cmass violence with impunity\u201d in central Mali. He told the Guardian that Australia should stop exporting arms to Mali. Tine said the diffusion of arms in the region should be considered a crime against humanity, and urged the international community, including the UN security council and African Union, to do more to pressure those nations exporting arms to conflict zones. \u201cWhat solutions exist to stop the spread of weapons, end violence and its tragic consequences in the Sahel, which actively poses a threat to the existence of states, results in millions of deaths and precipitates humanitarian catastrophes?\u201d Tine said. \u201cThe international community, notably the security council of the United Nations and the African Union, must hold countries which are actively producing and selling weapons accountable, and pressure them to cease these practices in all conflict zones, including the Sahel.\u201d \u201cThe democratisation and the diffusion of weapons must be considered to be a crime against humanity.\u201d The Australian government says its export licences are only issued after thorough assessments on whether arms will be used to breach human rights or any of Australia\u2019s international obligations. If there is an overriding risk that the weapons could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of humanitarian law, defence says it will not issue an export permit. The department has, however, refused to say what it is exporting, to whom, and for what purpose. Requests under freedom of information law for such details have been refused. Human Rights Watch, Oxfam and Save the Children have all called for greater transparency on Australia\u2019s arms sales. Tine said the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 seeks to put an end to the use of weapons, as well as controlling the quantity of weapons circulating in the Sahel, a massive stretch of Africa that incorporates central Mali. \u201cIn the Sahel, the intent behind the possession of weapons and the practice of violence has never been democratic in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, no less than 20 million weapons circulate in the Sahel (including kalashnikovs, heavy machine guns, rocket propelled grenades, and surface to air missiles).\u201d \u201cIn Libya, between 800,000 and 1 million weapons are estimated to be in circulation.\u201d Nikita White, from Amnesty International, said the organisation had repeatedly called on the Australian government to publicly report the details of its international arms transfers. \u201cAs we approach the fifth anniversary of the conflict in Yemen it would behove our government to remember that Australia is obliged under the Arms Trade Treaty not to authorise weapons transfers to countries where there is an overriding risk these weapons could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international human rights or humanitarian law.\u201d White said Australians had a right to know whether weapons from Australia were being sent to countries where they risked being used to commit war crimes. \u201cAll parties to the conflict in Yemen, including the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. The coalition has carried out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring civilians and the conflict has displaced millions and put up to half of Yemen\u2019s population at risk of starvation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
