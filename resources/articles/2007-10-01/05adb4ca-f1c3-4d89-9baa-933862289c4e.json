The article, on the official response to this year's Commission on Integration and Cohesion report, indicates that the money \"is to be channelled over three years to groups which promote integration, rather than towards bodies which represent a single ethnic or religious identity\". It would be a shame if the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, did shift funds away from faith and minority ethnic groups. She talks about measuring success in terms of progress towards greater cohesion, something we would all welcome. I believe this injection of funds could, and indeed should, lead to more funding for many such groups. Your article rightly points out that the \"shift in funding to groups which promote integration has been criticised by the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action (Navca), which has raised fears that it could trigger a funding crisis for some minority ethnic groups\". This is a view firmly held by Navca and many other national bodies. The commission's report, Our Shared Future, took the view that funding minority groups increases segregation and should become the exception. I disagree. During my career I have worked with community groups in Hull, Newcastle and Derby, and I am now in touch with Navca's members throughout England. That experience has convinced me that, far from reinforcing segregation, funding for faith and minority ethnic groups often helps them become effective advocates on behalf of their communities. All such organisations have a responsibility to build bridges between communities in order to improve understanding and acceptance. Many also provide valuable local services, tailored to meet the needs of people whom mainstream services frequently fail. Your article quotes Ted Cantle, chair of the Institute of Community Cohesion, who says that \"with 120 languages spoken in most UK cities, the point has been passed where every group is going to get a community centre\". Of course, no serious person is going to argue for 120 community centres in any one area. Cantle misses the point: this is not about centres but about how all communities are able to voice their concerns. To me, Blears hedges her bets. While she does suggest that councils \"think twice\" before funding \"one particular community\", she understands that \"particular groups\" may \"draw strength from resources within their own community\" and that in some communities women require very specific support. I firmly believe that funding should be directed to those groups that make a contribution to their own particular community or to society as a whole, but the two are not mutually exclusive. By helping minority ethnic groups build their self-sufficiency we enable them to take an active part in civil society. Removing support would disadvantage the most vulnerable and socially excluded. Yes, we must promote integration, but we should never apologise for offering support to those who need it. \u00b7 Kevin Curley is the chief executive of the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action kevin.curley@navca.org.uk If you wish to respond to an article in which you have featured, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
