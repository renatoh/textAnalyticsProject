Sullivan, who described Birmingham's current form as \"appalling\", said that the club \"would go bankrupt\" if they failed to retain their Premiership status after buying new players during the January transfer window. The news will be a severe disappointment to Bruce, who last week expressed his desire to add to a squad that has been plagued by injuries. He has already targeted the Austrian international Paul Scharner, though that deal might now have to be put on hold. \"I don't think we can actually get better players than we've got,\" said Sullivan. \"We've spent all our money, we've done a pile on wages this season and we would be in a dire mess financially if we gambled and got relegated. We would go bankrupt. By January we could be so badly adrift it wouldn't make a difference if we signed the whole England team. Saying that, it depends who becomes available and what the prices are. I think we have to make decisions based on the circumstances and events at the time.\" Birmingham are currently second from bottom, having won once in the league this season. They have lost their last four Premiership matches without scoring a goal and have picked up one point from a possible 18 at home. Sullivan dismissed reports that he has considered sacking Bruce as \"ludicrous\", though he did admit to harbouring genuine fears about whether Birmingham are capable of climbing clear of the relegation zone. \"I really don't know if we are going to turn this round,\" said Sullivan. \"I can't deny I'm extremely unhappy with our appalling form and the way we are playing. It's extremely worrying and I'm on the floor about what's happening.\" The Bolton striker El Hadji Diouf has been charged with drunken driving and has been released on bail. The Senegal international was arrested early on Sunday morning in Bolton, police said. He is to appear before a Bolton judge on November 21. In a statement police said they stopped the Bolton player at 4.20am and gave him a breath test. \"He was then arrested and taken to Astley Bridge police station, where he was charged with drink driving,\" the statement said. Diouf is to stand trial on December 8 in a Middlesbrough court, charged with spitting on a young Middlesbrough fan during a match late last year. He has denied the charge of disorderly conduct. Mathieu Flamini's 2004 move to Arsenal has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which dismissed an appeal from Marseille, his former club. The French club petitioned the CAS to annul Flamini's contract with Arsenal, claiming they had prior claim on the midfielder. However, the Lausanne-based body -sport's highest court - rejected the appeal, confirming Marseille were due only the \u20ac480,000 (\u00a3326,530) \"training compensation\" fixed by Fifa last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
