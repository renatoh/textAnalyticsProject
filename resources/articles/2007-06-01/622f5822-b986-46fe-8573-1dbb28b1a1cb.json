Karlovic fought back from a set down to defeat the Frenchman Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment 3- 6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday to finish his Wimbledon preparations with a flourish. The 29-year-old Karlovic succeeded Richard Gasquet as champion with a typically serve-dominated showing to claim his second title of the season after winning in Houston in April. \"To tell the truth I didn't really expect to win,\" Karlovic said. \"I came here to play a few matches, I was the last player in the draw. I was injured last year for six months and I did not really have good preparations for this year but so far it is my best year.\" Cl\u00e9ment, the No8 seed, defeated Karlovic at Queen's Club last week and took the opening set in the final here after breaking serve in the fourth game when Karlovic skewed a simple backhand volley. But the Croatian rallied, breaking in the 10th game to take the second set. The 6ft 10in Karlovic's serve was always his biggest weapon, with one ace recorded at 153mph - just 2mph short of the American Andy Roddick's world record. The Croatian broke Cl\u00e9ment's fifth service game in the final set as the world No38 began to show the signs of having played two matches on Friday. After saving two championship points, the Frenchman was wrongfooted when his opponent's backhand ricocheted off the net cord and fired wide to hand his opponent the title. Karlovic will face Fabrice Santoro, of France, in the first round at Wimbledon. Jamie Murray and the American Eric Butorac fought back from a set down to win the doubles title. The third seeds defeated the British youngsters Joshua Goodall and Ross Hutchins 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 to clinch their third ATP title of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
