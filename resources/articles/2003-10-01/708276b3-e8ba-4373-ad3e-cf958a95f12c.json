Have disappointed otherwise. Darkest day: Fell for David Campese's wind-up tactics in the days before the 1991 final. England decided to throw the ball around, rather than playing to strengths and keeping it with the forwards. Australia ran out 12-6 winners. Won't let you forget: Campo again. His deliberate knock-on late in that final was spotted by the referee who stated after the game that it was not, in his opinion, a definite try scoring opportunity. He awarded a penalty, rather than a penalty try that would have levelled the match and left Will Carling's troops with a great chance of victory. Svengali factor: Clive Woodward can lay claim to being the best coach currently earning a wage. Has signed on until 2007, but if the unthinkable was to happen and Martin Johnson's men flop, then what? How do you beat them? Not very easily. The hard way is to hope to keep them out with strong defence and frustrate them. An easier method, though still with no guarantees, is to nobble fly-half, playmaker and kicker supreme Jonny Wilkinson as soon as possible and risk having a man sent off. Hardly Corinthian, but... How do they beat you? By squeezing the life from you with their relentless defence and by pressing home every advantage in attack. Oh, and Wilkinson averages more than 15 points per Test. Lost without: No less important than Wilkinson is centre Will Greenwood. Chief organiser of an impregnable defence and a close friend of the tryline. Avoid in a dark alley: Lawrence Dallaglio. Just ask the members of the New Zealand and Australia back rows who played against him this summer for their warm, glowing memories. Home view: 'England have never been better prepared, mentally or physically. If Wilkinson avoids the hit-men and England reach the final, they will win,' says Observer chief sports writer Kevin Mitchell. OSM prediction: Should make the final playing their cold professional stuff, where the form suggests they will meet New Zealand. Close, but who will be puffing on that cigar? The squad Backs: I Balshaw, B Cohen, J Lewsey, D Luger, J Robinson, S Abbott, W Greenwood, M Tindall, M Catt, P Grayson, J Wilkinson, K Bracken, M Dawson, A Gomarsall. Forwards: J Leonard, P Vickery, J White, T Woodman, M Regan, S Thompson, D West, D Grewcock, M Johnson, B Kay, N Back, M Corry, L Dallaglio, R Hill, L Moody, J Worsley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
