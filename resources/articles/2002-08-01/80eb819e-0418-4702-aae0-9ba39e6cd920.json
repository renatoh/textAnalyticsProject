Escud\u00e9, a France Under-21 international, returns to his club for treatment this morning on crutches after straining the ligaments in his left knee. He is expected to be sidelined for up to three weeks, effectively ending any chance of completing a move to Old Trafford before the transfer deadline on August 31. \"I was walking the dog and I slipped on the curb and hurt my left knee,\" said the defender, who had been training alone in protest at his club's reluctance to bring forward the talks with United. \"I've strained one of the ligaments in the knee; I've got a splint on it and I will have to use crutches for three or four days. \"I'm having anti-inflammatory drugs to try and reduce the swelling but I think it will take about three weeks to recover. I hope it doesn't bring my transfer into question. It's not too serious and I will recover fully but it's really infuriating. I really didn't need this.\" United officials, including the chief executive Peter Kenyon, flew to Rennes a fortnight ago hoping to open formal talks over a \u00a34.5m move for Escud\u00e9 to act as cover for his compatriot Mikael Silvestre, only for Rennes to put back any talks until August 25, six days before the deadline. Those talks will go ahead regardless, though the French club are adamant that they do not want to sell. \"Julien's had an unfortunate accident and injured his left knee but it's nothing too serious and we hope he will be all right in two or three weeks,\" said the spokesman J\u00e9r\u00f4me Poupard, who will now be hoping that United's attentions turn to Lazio's unwanted Argentinian left-back Juan Pablo Sorin. \"This makes no difference at all to our plans,\" Poupard added. \"Julien is a Rennes player and we hope that he will remain so, though maybe it will make a difference to Manchester United's plans. \"There is no question of him being allowed to leave, whether he likes it or not. We had a meeting with them on August 11 and there is another meeting planned for this Sunday. We have had no contact from them since the first meeting, although we know United have been in contact with the player again, which it seems we can do nothing about.\" Gary Neville, meanwhile, expects to make his comeback from the broken metatarsal he suffered in April when Bolton are their visitors on September 11. Fabien Barthez, however, is hopeful of making it for next Tuesday's Champions League qualifier with Zalaegerszeg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
