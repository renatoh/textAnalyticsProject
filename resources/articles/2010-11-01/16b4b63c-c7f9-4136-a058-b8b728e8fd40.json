The policy work is being overseen by Norman Lamb MP, chairman of the federal policy committee and one of Nick Clegg's closest political allies. The move reflects determination within the party that it has a distinctive message in the latter half of this parliament and by the time of the next election, that will allow it to remain politically equidistant between the main two parties. Many Liberal Democrats are worried about how the party will manage an exit strategy from the coalition at the 2015 election. The Lamb-led work was being emphasised today by senior Lib Dems as it emerged that Clegg and David Cameron have given their blessing to separate plans for senior Conservative and Lib Dem politicians to work together unofficially on a joint policy prospectus for the coalition for the second half of the parliament. It is thought the bulk of the current coalition programme will be implemented by 2013-14, so the two parties will need what they hope will be a joint post-austerity programme, and want to look at how their distinct philosophies might operate in less constrained financial circumstances. Lib Dems involved in this second initiative include Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, David Laws, former Treasury chief secretary, Julian Astle, director of CentreForum, the Liberal Democrat orientated thinktank, Paul Marshall, a hedge-fund millionaire and Tim Leunig, a Liberal Democrat minded academic at the London School of Economics who has also written for Policy Exchange, the leading Cameron thinktank. The Conservative team is led by Greg Clark, minister for decentralisation, and includes education secretary Michael Gove, and Times columnist Danny Finkelstein, a close ally of George Osborne. Both Finkelstein and Clark are ex-members of the SDP, the party formed as Labour moved left in the early 80s. But it also contains right-leaning Euro-sceptic Conservatives such as Owen Paterson, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Tim Montgomerie, editor of the Conservativehome website. Sajid Javed, the MP for Bromsgrove, is also involved. Astle stressed that the work being prepared through seminars at CentreForum was not designed to prepare a programme for the coalition beyond 2015, the date of the next election. But the work does show the extent to which the two parties are probing their differences and similarities. It also reflects a recognition that the Liberal Democrats, whatever their current difficulties over tuition fees or counter-terrorism legislation, recognise that their fate is tied to ensuring the coalition works right through the parliament. At a seminar on future Liberal Democrat thinking, organised by the Institute for Government, Astle argued that Lib Dem policy had \"been insufficiently alert\" to state failure. He wanted to promote devolution from Whitehall and town hall to individuals, families, communities and other groupings. He felt that David Cameron's \"big society\" was core liberalism, and that this was a joint insight the two parties had come to understand. Change could not be achieved unless all these resources were mobilised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
