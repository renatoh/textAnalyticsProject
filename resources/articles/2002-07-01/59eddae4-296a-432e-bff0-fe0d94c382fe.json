It may seem absurd to describe an Intertoto Cup game in July as a crunch match, but when the Cottagers go to FC Haka tomorrow, having drawn the first leg 0-0, they know the result could play a major part in their season - and beyond. The belief at Craven Cottage is that victory in the Intertoto - and the Uefa Cup place that it brings - could mark a breakthrough in Fulham's development. So far, despite having his chairman Mohamed Al Fayed's millions to play with, the manager Jean Tigana has been frustrated in the transfer market, largely because foreign players simply have not heard of a club who just six years ago were languishing in the Third Division. Uefa Cup qualification would change all that, and the players are well aware that Sunday's match is anything but a meaningless friendly. \"This is a very important game for us,\" said the captain Andy Melville. \"We know what getting to the Uefa Cup could do for us. It would make it a lot easier to attract the big players and there is no doubt that we need a larger squad this season - especially after starting so early in the Intertoto. \"It's important to have a big, strong squad. Last year when we played the top teams we came unstuck a little bit and lost touch with the top six. We knew the squad wasn't big enough. So now we have to bring more in if we are going to improve. \"We just need two or three players at the most, we don't have to go mad. But we need people to be refreshed during the season and we need to be able to give players a rest sometimes.\" Tigana, told this week by the new director of football Franco Baresi that he is still in sole charge of signing players, has already begun the process of boosting numbers at Craven Cottage, having signed striker Facundo Sava and goalkeeper Martin Herrera. He is also pursuing Arsenal's Japanese midfielder Junichi Inamoto and Vitesse Arnhem's Viktor Sikora and has worked hard to keep his own promising players such as Steve Finnan out of the clutches of the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal. \"That's what the chairman and manager are about, they want to keep the best players here,\" said Melville, who this week joined Bjarne Goldbaek in signing a new contract. \"I don't think people like Finnan are going. Fulham want to keep everyone together and the way Finns played for Ireland in the World Cup was good for Fulham. His performances will encourage big players to come here.\" Fulham will have to cope without Finnan in Finland because he is yet to return from an extended summer break after his World Cup exploits. But Tigana has no other major absentees and his only concern is how to end the goal drought that cost his team so many points last season - and that saw the first leg against Haka end goalless despite a succession of chances. \"That was frustrating,\" admitted Melville. \"We will have to do something different in Finland and we will work on that before the game. We may have to to mix it up instead of just playing in front of them. The name of the game is patience. \"But we know we have quality players up front and if we create as many chances again then they will score. We are fully focused on doing that and we know this is not a friendly game. It may have come a little early, but it is an important match for Fulham.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
