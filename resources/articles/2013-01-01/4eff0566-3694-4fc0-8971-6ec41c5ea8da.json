That's the signature sound of much new jazz today, after all. But Loop Collective bassist/composer Dave Manington's Riff Raff mix the leader's clever composing with a formidable lineup, including Ivo Neame on piano and occasional accordion, the articulate Tomas Challenger on tenor, and the excellent Tim Giles on drums. Add John Scofield-like guitarist Rob Updegraff and softly surefooted vocalist Brigitte Beraha, and the soundscape embraces a 21st century sax-led cool school sound, raw guitar-fusion, diffident Wayne Shorteresque lyricism, and vocals that showcase Beraha's eloquent lyrics and inventiveness as a wordless improviser. Some pieces are staccato and angular (like the opening Agile), some gracefully seamless (Challenger's and Beraha's entwining lines on the title track before its guitar/drums burnup). Not A Worthless Thing demonstrates the band's capacity for relaxed, asymmetrical swing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
