Shelvey collected his sixth yellow card of the league season against Aston Villa on Friday following a cynical foul on Gabriel Agbonlahor \u2013 he was sent off against Everton in November after being booked twice \u2013 and Monk said the midfielder is running the risk of becoming a liability. Although Monk described Shelvey as a player with \u201cfrightening ability\u201d and stressed that he does not want his criticism to come across as harsh, the Swansea manager admitted he has become increasingly frustrated with Shelvey\u2019s tendency to pick up \u201csilly bookings\u201d that impact on his performance and run the risk of costing the team points. Monk explained that it was for those reasons that Shelvey, 22, was withdrawn early in the second half of the Boxing Day win against Villa. Before Monday\u2019strip to Liverpool, where Shelvey spent three years before joining Swansea, Monk said the time has come for the former Charlton trainee to \u201cwise up\u201d and learn from his mistakes or be prepared to watch games from the sidelines. \u201cI have spoken to him clearly about it. Silly bookings, we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d the Swansea manager said. \u201cAt the end of the day it costs him being on the pitch. I could have made that substitution [against Villa] at half-time, but I didn\u2019t. I thought about it. But then I knew within 10 minutes or so that I would make the substitution. Those conditions, any slight mistimed tackle, which could have been unfortunate, and it would be a red card. I have spoken to Jonjo about this and he has to wise up. \u201cThe yellow card came from laziness, and he has to be better than that. I have spoken to him a number of times about this and there is only so many times you can say it. He has to learn very quickly and make sure he does the work instead of being lazy with it and he won\u2019t pick up those yellow cards and risk a red or coming off the pitch. \u201cIt is about doing your job properly, understanding the role that you are playing, not just for yourself but for the team. Jonjo has to learn very quickly from it, otherwise he won\u2019t play games, it is as simple as that. I don\u2019t want to be in that position where he gets a yellow and I\u2019m thinking the rest of the game that there could be a sending off here. I shouldn\u2019t be put in that position, I shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that, so it isn\u2019t my problem, it is Jonjo\u2019s.\u201d One of the biggest frustrations for Monk is that Shelvey, who was called up to the England squad for the European Championship qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia in October, is supremely talented and capable of being one of the most influential players in the Swansea team. \u201cI see him every single day and his ability is frightening,\u201d Monk said. \u201cI said to him that I\u2019m more than willing to give him the chance to show that ability, I work with him every day and I will push him every day, but you also need to want it yourself. I think he does want it, but he has to understand that the time for being lazy with it has gone. He has to push himself. The team are trying to push now, and the demands I put on them is the same I put on him. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, Jonjo. This sounds harsh, but I am not meaning it to come across harsh. I have told him privately. I am not making this a massive issue, but it is about Jonjo understanding what it is. The last thing I want to do is take him off the pitch because I know the ability he has. But I can\u2019t afford with what has been going on this season a few times with Jonjo \u2026 as soon as you get a yellow card, you run the risk of a red. And the other bit is, even if he doesn\u2019t make a silly challenge, you are taking away half the player again because he feels he can\u2019t make a tackle or touch anyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
