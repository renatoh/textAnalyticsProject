Shinji Okazaki scored Leicester\u2019s first after Liverpool could only half-clear a corner and Islam Slimani added the second following a throw-in, leaving Klopp lamenting familiar failings. \u201cThe story of this game is really easy to tell,\u201d the Liverpool manager said after the 2-0 defeat. \u201cWe were the much better team in the first half, we didn\u2019t score \u2013 that\u2019s sometimes part of football. It was unlucky in one or two moments, maybe not clinical enough in others. But as long as we concede goals like we conceded today again, then it is quite difficult. \u201cWe should have scored three but as long as you leave games open, you have to defend. We always have to defend these situations better. The second ball after the corner, it\u2019s close but it\u2019s not offside. So we need to make it more clear that it\u2019s offside. The only thing you can do is to push up \u2013 we didn\u2019t. With the second one it is a throw-in again. Everyone can imagine we know how to defend them but obviously we don\u2019t do it, because always somebody else is doing it. It doesn\u2019t feel too cool but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d Klopp, who decided before the game that Philippe Coutinho would play only the opening 45 minutes, denied Liverpool\u2019s heads dropped. \u201cAfter the first goal you saw the heads from Leicester went up, that was a bigger difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game changes in moments like this \u2013 you have the chance to do it by yourself or sometimes you are on the wrong side. But that we concede like this, that makes me really, really sick.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
