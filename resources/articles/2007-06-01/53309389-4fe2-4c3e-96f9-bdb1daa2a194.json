Mick Nanyn is one of the few Widnes players not to have played in Super League but at this level the powerful three-quarter is a prodigious points-scorer. In this game the centre scored a try and kicked five goals as his side beat the Tigers for the second time this year. Their opponents in the final next month will be Whitehaven, who recovered from 18-0 down to beat Halifax 34-19. Still, it would be a major surprise if the Vikings and Castleford were not the two sides contesting the National League One Grand Final come October. The Widnes coach, Steve McCormack, has been on the losing side of the past three Grand Finals - the first two with Whitehaven - but on this evidence his side look well placed to end that run. The Northern Rail Cup provides an intriguing mid-season diversion and the chance for the Vikings to lift their first piece of silverware since 1992. \"This club has been on a downer for the last two to three years but this is a competition I've always taken seriously,\" said McCormack, who lost several players to head injuries. \"Physically it was up there with anything I've seen at any level this year. There was a lot of battered, bruised and cut bodies out there. It was a good, old-fashioned game.\" Widnes dominated the first half-hour to take a 14-0 lead. They opened the scoring when the wily scrum-half Dennis Moran put the prop Oliver Wilkes over out wide. Soon afterwards Nanyn powered through several tackles to score. He added both conversions and a penalty awarded against Danny Brough for dissent. The Tigers dragged themselves back into the contest before half-time with two tries to the teenage prop Ryan Boyle, one of a host of promising youngsters at the club. Boyle twice took passes from Brough to close the gap to two points. However, Nanyn's boot twice punished Castleford indiscipline with close-range penalties after the interval. The Tigers rallied briefly late on but Widnes stood firm, with Paul Noone, Mark Smith and Bob Beswick leading the resistance. \"We had to do so much tackling that we didn't seem to have any juice when we were attacking,\" the Tigers coach, Terry Matterson, said. \"I was happy with the effort but we were dumb at times. It would have been good to make the final but we can concentrate on the main one now.\" Castleford Tigers Saxton; Donlan, Shenton, Dixon, Wainwright; McGoldrick, Brough; Leafa, Henderson, Huby, Guttenbeil, Charles, Clayton.
