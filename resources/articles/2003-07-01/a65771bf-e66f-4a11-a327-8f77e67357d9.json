Victors who came from nowhere", "bodyText": "Olin Dutra 1934 US 0pen Not a name to conjure with and one that appears in the history books just the once when he went to Merion, had his week and beat Gene Sarazen. It got him into the 1935 Ryder Cup team and in the foursomes he played with another wonderful name, Ky Laffoon, the man who once tied his putter to his back bumper and dragged it to the next tournament, to teach it a lesson. They lost to the Whitcombe brothers, Charles and Ernest. Alf Perry 1935 Open championship A club professional from Leatherhead, he begged a few days off from the club and won by four from an undistinguished field. Last seen nursing the trophy on his knees sitting on a bench at Drem, the railway station nearest to Muirfield, waiting for a train to take him home. Herman Keiser 1946 US Masters He had won nothing of note when he won the green jacket but, amazingly, he held on to beat none other than Ben Hogan. He won nothing of note after that tournament, either. Ed Furgol 1954 US Open The man with the withered arm. That was his claim to fame. He couldn't straighten his left arm, which led to all sorts of compensations in his swing and made people wonder why he was a professional golfer. He showed them in '54, but never again. Kel Nagle 1960 Open championship The Centenary Open; Kel, a good but hardly well-known golfer from Australia, spoiled the script when he won from Arnold Palmer, then at the height of his powers. Nagle putted about as well as Bob Charles did when he won from nowhere in 1963 and Justin Leonard did in 1997. Paul Lawrie 1999 Open championship Until Curtis, Lawrie was the lowest-ranked golfer to win a major, being placed at 159th when he took the title at Carnoustie. That championship could have been won by the 156th-placed golfer in the rankings, had not Jean Van de Velde taken a triple-bogey seven at the last.
