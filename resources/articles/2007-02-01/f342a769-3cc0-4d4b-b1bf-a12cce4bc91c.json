Welcome to Moscow where, unlike paralysed Britain, life continued much as usual yesterday, despite 15cm of snow and temperatures as low as -27C (-17F). After the warmest December and January on record, Russia's winter arrived on Wednesday night, carpeting the capital in whiteness and freezing the Moscow river. But when it comes to winter the Russians have one thing the British lack - a comprehensive plan. From the early hours of yesterday an army of snegoborochnaya mashina - snowploughs - took to Moscow's streets. The city council employs some 50,000 workers to clear snow from yards. Result: everyone gets to work on time. Marina Orlova, a spokeswoman for the council, said: \"For us winter starts on October 15. It ends in March. We have a committee of experts who meet every day at 5pm. They include a weather expert and an official from the crisis ministry. If there's going to be snow, we load up trucks and send them out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
