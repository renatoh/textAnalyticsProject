I'm not prejudiced. I believe in an open and tolerant society. It's just that I think we've let too many Lib Dems into politics. I blame the last government. Labour claimed to be tough on Lib Dems, but then enacted policies that saw them flooding into Parliament. They're not all bad. Some of them dress a bit funny, but then, some of their practices have become accepted. The problems start when you have too many. They dilute the government's identity. I'm not Lib Demist, but I do think that if they want to be part of a Tory administration they should learn to speak like Tories. Some of them manage it very well, but there is a minority of extremists who wreck coalition cohesion. And when I point it out, they get upset and accuse me of \"inflaming tensions\". I'm not trying to chuck them all out, I'd just like to see their number reduced back down to 1980s levels. What's the problem? David Cameron Dear Mr Cameron You have to understand the context in which your views will be interpreted. Since you come from the majority community in Parliament, you might not appreciate how the minority reads implicit threat into your words. The Lib Dems have suffered a long history of electoral oppression and it is understandable that they are wary of Tories who pronounce critically on their status. To many liberals, your \"tough\" language comes across as cynical opportunism, especially when you rely on many Lib Dems for essential coalition services. I suspect the cause of your irritation lies in political problems elsewhere. Making a scapegoat of this small party demeans you. Dear Dr Mander For many years, I have presided despotically over a regime famed for its cruelty. I have maintained my vice-like grip by humiliating anyone with ambition, dashing their hopes of a better future, while bribing a tiny elite to remain outwardly loyal. There are superficial trappings of democracy, giving the masses some illusion that they control things. But really it is a personality cult. I am colossally vain, demanding an entourage of personal attendants, nurses, lackeys etc. I tolerate no criticism and enjoy playing rival factions in my administration off against each other. It's not easy running The X Factor. Now I want to expand into the US and I need a trusted deputy to take over the operation at home. I'm not sure anyone in the world is up to it. Simon Cowell Dear Mr Cowell It is difficult for a regime that is centralised around a charismatic figurehead to survive transition to a new leader. You don't want The X Factor to Balkanise into autonomous shows run by warlords such as Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole. You need someone with experience of total, megalomaniac control. As it happens, I have the perfect candidate, based in Tripoli, who will soon be in need of work abroad. Communications with Libya are a bit tricky right now, but you can contact his agent c/o the London School of Economics. Dear Dr Mander I'm worried that the News of the World hasn't ever hacked my phone. Everyone who's anyone was snooped. Even John Prescott. Now I won't get a penny in compensation. But it's not about the money \u2013 my profile has really suffered. It's bad for my image if sleazy hacks don't consider me worth spying on. Bea Lister Dear Ms Lister If you are worried that journalists aren't being sufficiently intrusive, go to court to get an injunction blocking all reporting of your private affairs. Nothing is more certain to stoke media interest. Dr Gerry Mander shares his consulting room with Rafael Behr"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
