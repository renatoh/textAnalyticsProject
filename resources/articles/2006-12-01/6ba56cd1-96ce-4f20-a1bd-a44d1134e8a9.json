Born March, 28, 1981. Occupation Plays Ianto Jones in Doctor Who spin-off, Torchwood. College Coleg Gwent. Course BTec in performing arts. Attended 1998-2001. Peter Williams, lecturer and retired head of drama, recalls: \"I met Gareth when he was 14 and playing Henry V in a Gwent Young People's Theatre performance. The following year he played Macbeth. Then, in his first term at college, he played Faustus, while at the same time doing Macheath from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. By the time he was just 16, he'd played four of the major roles most actors would give their right arm to play in their lifetime. You just knew he was going to be something special and that it was only a matter of when. We've become great friends. I've been on the Torchwood set twice. He loves it and I think he'll start to get some valuable roles out of all this. He was asked by Newport borough to turn on their Christmas lights this year - that's when you know you've made it!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
