They pull out all the stops in order to match SNJO's enthusiasm and technique: Stern's purrs and feints rise up from Fred Sturm's sinewy remake of Marcus Miller's Splatch into a howling funk dialogue with drummer Alyn Cosker, while vibraphonist Joe Locke's cruising bebop lines unveil new twists to Wayne Shorter's Yes or No, and Bill Evans ducks, dives and thunders his way through Chick Corea's Quartet No 1 (Part 2). With the atmosphere of a live show, it's further testament to the SNJO's commitment and class, and a great set for big-band fans and admirers of the star soloists alike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
