It made for a moving ceremony at the Tate Modern in London, where the awards were presented by Dame Suzi Leather, Charity Commission chair. The awards, for small and medium-sized charities, are intended to recognise innovative practice that fills a gap in social welfare provision. Paying tribute to the distinctive role of smaller charities, Leather said: \"Their creativity, independence, their tenacity in pursuing their vision and championing their causes is truly impressive.\" Sponsored by NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, the awards offer each of the five winners a prize of \u00a36,000, plus a new PC provided by Smartchange.org, which promotes employee giving to charities. This year's winners are: \u00b7 1Voice, which brings together children and young people without speech, most of whom use communication technology. \u00b7 Motorvations, which works with young people excluded from formal education. \u00b7 Mosac, which helps families of children who have suffered sexual abuse. \u00b7 KPC Youth, a community project engaging young people and keeping them away from drugs and crime. \u00b7 Nacoa, the National Association of Children of Alcoholics, which supports youngsters living with parents with alcohol problems. Leather urged smaller charities not to feel pressured into playing down their campaigning role. She told the winners: \"Please be in no doubt at all that speaking out on the causes you represent is a key part of your charitable activity.\" This year's judges were: Jane Asher, president of the National Autistic Society, Lady Howarth, former chief executive of ChildLine, Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Tracey Betts, of NatWest/RBS, Vinay Khosla, of Smartchange.org, and David Brindle, public services editor of the Guardian.
