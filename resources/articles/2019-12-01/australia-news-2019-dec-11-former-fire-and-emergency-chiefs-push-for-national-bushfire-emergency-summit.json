It comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, rejected calls on Tuesday for additional help for volunteers who have been fighting fires and assisting fire-affected communities in New South Wales and Queensland for weeks. Asked how tens of thousands of volunteers were expected to continue without pay, Morrison said they \u201cwant to be there\u201d. But two former fire chiefs \u2013 Greg Mullins from NSW and Lee Johnson in Queensland \u2013 say a national summit is necessary to discuss not only the increasing strain on volunteers battling more extreme and frequent bushfires, but also how Australia deals with fire in a changed climate. Mullins and Johnson are part of a coalition of former emergency leaders who have been calling on the government do more to address the climate crisis. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying long term is there needs to be a paradigm shift for how we deal with these fires,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cA big national conversation needs to be had. We need farmers, councils, the military, politics. \u201cThere needs to be an emergency summit and there needs to be an acknowledgment from the government that climate change has created conditions for the worst fires we\u2019ve had in NSW and Queensland.\u201d Mullins, who has been volunteering with RFS crews in Taree, said well-structured resource-sharing arrangements between states and other countries were working well. The challenge would come if more major fires took hold in Victoria and South Australia further into summer. Mullins said it was not unusual for volunteers to work 12-hour shifts, with a two-hour drive on each side of that. \u201cIt\u2019s not even peak season yet and the fires haven\u2019t come into suburbia yet, which is historically where the worst losses have been,\u201d he said. But the bigger challenge was longer-term planning for fire seasons similar or worse than the current one. A summit needed to talk about not just resourcing for increasingly challenging fires, but also adaptation measures such as reviewing building codes for houses in fire-prone areas, examining how to make better use of the defence force during bushfires, and other measures such as fuel reduction. Johnson said: \u201cVolunteers are under a great deal of strain, no doubt about it, and that\u2019s impacting their personal circumstances.\u201d That was the case not only for fire crews, but also organisations such as the CWA, the Red Cross and religious organisations that were supporting regional communities. \u201cWhat your regional communities are going through is putting a great strain on the economy and wellbeing of those communities. It\u2019s not to be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re asking people to fight fires in a season extending months, that\u2019s a big ask for free labour. \u201cThe real worry is: is it going to be the same again next year?\u201d Johnson and Mullins said they did not believe governments had the budgets to support a professionalised firefighting force that could do what the volunteers do. Instead they needed to look at ways to support the volunteers they already have and develop incentives to encourage new and younger ones to sign up. The NSW RFS said the fires have had on average 2,000 firefighters from all services on the ground each day. On Tuesday there were also 47 personnel from New Zealand and 21 each from the US and Canada. Defence personnel have helped with search and rescue, logistics and building impact assessments. A spokesman said the organisation did not expect a shortage of volunteers heading into Christmas and as more fatigue set in, but the duration of the emergency was \u201cstarting to take its toll\u201d. Requests for resources from other states or overseas are coordinated through the national resources sharing centre, which sits within the Australasian fire and emergency service authorities council. In a statement on Tuesday, the council\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Ellis, said suggestions there was a lack of national coordination of fire and emergency services were wrong. \u201cAustralia has a formidable emergency management capability,\u201d he said. He said state and territory governments spent more than $5.5bn to support fire and emergency services across Australia and New Zealand last year and the country had more than 290,000 personnel and thousands of specialist vehicles. There was integrated engagement with the commonwealth and national protocols for managing incident responses and the available fleet of 140 aircraft and international personnel. \u201cThese personnel are all trained, equipped and prepared to assist,\u201d Ellis said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
