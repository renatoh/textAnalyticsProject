As a former supreme court justice, surely he knows that our personal freedoms are rightly constrained by the imperative that they do not harm others. We are not allowed to drink and drive; most people who do this judge themselves not to be a risk. Science shows that they are wrong. The tragedy of this virus is that it pits our freedom to socialise, not to risk our mental health or our jobs against the freedom of others not to have their lives and jobs put at risk. There is no good solution, only a balance that we should not see as an entitlement, but accept with regret and compassion. To balance all these factors would require a government that was competent, well-informed, compassionate, willing to admit failure and trustworthy about being fair \u2013 one that treated us as adults and involved us, and was seen to have our best interests at heart. Then we could make a free decision to follow the rules; we would not need to be terrorised. This government has failed on all counts. It treats us as children and we behave as such. Ellen van der Bij Bristol \u2022 Jonathan Sumption believes future generations will consider the UK\u2019s response to Covid as \u201ccollective hysteria and governmental folly\u201d. Another prediction is that future generations will marvel at the remarkable collective unity that the world achieved to meet this health challenge. The world has come together to protect the lives of the vulnerable, sacrificing collective freedoms and financial gain for the health of all. This isn\u2019t folly, but rather reflects one of humanity\u2019s greatest aspirations \u2013 to care for one another.
