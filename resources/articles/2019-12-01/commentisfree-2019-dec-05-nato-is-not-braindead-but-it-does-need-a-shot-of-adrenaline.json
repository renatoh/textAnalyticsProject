Another multilateral summit with democratic allies, another embarrassment for Trump and the country he\u2019s supposed to lead. Sigh. Nato is facing a crisis sparked by Trump. The leader of Nato\u2019s most important member regularly criticizes the alliance. He acts as though Nato countries owe the United States money as part of a protection racket, revealing a lack of understanding of the value of the alliance and how Nato works (countries don\u2019t pay one another). He praises the leader of Russia \u2013 Nato\u2019s biggest adversary \u2013 and asked for Russia\u2019s help to win his campaign in 2016. He abruptly pulled US forces out of Syria with no coordination with Nato, despite the potentially major implications for European security. The Syria withdrawal appeared to be the last straw for France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron. Tired of vacuous Nato summits spent tiptoeing around Trump, Macron let loose in an interview with the Economist, saying that Nato is suffering from \u201cbrain death\u201d. Macron claimed that Europe does not recognize how dangerous Trump is to the alliance and that it\u2019s time for Europe to take responsibility for its own security. And Macron is not the only leader who\u2019s had enough. In London, while sitting next to Trump, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, pushed back against Trump\u2019s criticism that allies don\u2019t do enough, schooling the president about Canada\u2019s significant contributions to transatlantic security. Allied leaders could be seen on camera making fun of Trump, which seemed to be the cause of Trump\u2019s precipitous departure. But Nato\u2019s problems are bigger than Trump, and no matter how much longer he\u2019s in office, Nato members will have to contend with threats to the very nature of the alliance. Nato\u2019s first out-of-area mission in Afghanistan has sputtered along without conclusion. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, invaded Syrian territory which was being defended by three other Nato allies \u2013 the United States, Great Britain and France. Turkish and Hungarian leaders have gutted their democracies and warmed up to Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, with Erdo\u011fan going so far as to purchase weapons from Russia. In order to remain relevant, alliances must evolve, which Nato has done before: after the cold war Nato embraced new members, and after 9/11 it took on terrorism. Nato\u2019s last \u201cStrategic Concept\u201d \u2013 the document outlining its priorities \u2013 was adopted in 2010. To adapt to today\u2019s world \u2013 a newly aggressive Russia, an unreliable US president, growing challenges from China and instability within the EU \u2013 Nato must evolve again. To strengthen the alliance, Nato\u2019s members must look to the organization\u2019s roots. Nato was created to deter the Soviet Union, protect the fledgling democracies of western Europe, and bind the United States and Europe together. Replace the Soviet Union with Russia, and these three goals are as relevant as ever. Here\u2019s how to achieve them. First, Nato members must maintain its democratic identity. Nato is not just a military alliance \u2013 it represents values embodied by democracy. While Nato included some non-democratic states during the cold war, today democracy is a prerequisite for Nato membership. But the erosion of democracy in Turkey, Hungary and elsewhere threatens the very identity of Nato. Nato must impose consequences on those members who no longer reflect its values \u2013 or maybe they should not be members at all. Second, members must see Nato as part of the broader transatlantic relationship. America\u2019s commitment to defend Europe through Nato provided the security necessary for Europe\u2019s democracies to flourish and for their economies to integrate and grow. The European Union blossomed under Nato\u2019s protection, and together the two institutions welcomed new members when the cold war ended. But the EU faces serious challenges, from Brexit to democratic erosion in member states like Hungary and Poland. Nato\u2019s future cannot be divorced from the future of the European project \u2013 keeping the continent united and free. For Europeans, that means not taking for granted what they\u2019ve built in the EU. For the United States, that means building a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the EU, as my Center for American Progress colleague Max Bergmann suggests. Third, Nato must have the right Russia strategy. Russia\u2019s provocations against eastern Europe are seen as existential threats for those countries that were formerly behind the iron curtain. Europe and the United States are under attack from Russian active measures to undermine democracy. Nato must deter Russia, and it must support its neighbors like Ukraine who want to be closer to Europe but face threats from Russia. This does not mean Nato should return to a cold war footing \u2013 Nato must deter and defend, but it also must find a way to cooperate with Russia on reducing the threat of nuclear weapons and push for dialogue to reduce tensions, while leaving the door open to Russia to change course. Fourth, Nato allies must build stronger bonds with the world\u2019s democracies. From Japan to South Korea, South Africa to Indonesia, Ghana to Costa Rica, democracies across the world share values and interests \u2013 and often face similar threats that undermine democratic institutions. Nato members must look abroad \u2013 not for military alliances, but for partnerships with other democracies and forums like the Community of Democracies to tackle global issues from climate change to internet freedom. Nato is not braindead. But it does need a shot of adrenaline \u2013 and that can only be provided by its member states once again embracing the values that birthed Nato."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
