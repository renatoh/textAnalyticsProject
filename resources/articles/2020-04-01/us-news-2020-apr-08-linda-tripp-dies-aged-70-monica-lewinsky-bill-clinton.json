She was 70. Tripp\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Murtha, confirmed Tripp\u2019s death to the Guardian earlier today, but did not provide further details. Thomas Foley, Tripp\u2019s son-in-law, told the New York Post she had died from an illness that was not related to the coronavirus. He described her as \u201ca special person and a fantastic grandparent who was devoted\u201d to her family. Allison Tripp Foley, Tripp\u2019s daughter, shared in a Facebook post late on Tuesday saying her 70-year-old mother was terminally ill, according to the New York Post. Her Facebook profile was later made private. \u201cWe were like sisters. I loved her. I\u2019m heartbroken right now,\u201d Diane Spreadbury, a close friend of Tripp\u2019s, told the Daily Mail. \u201cI\u2019m glad for her that it was very peaceful. I\u2019ve been told she died with a smile on her face,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had discussed death many times and spoke of it together when she faced breast cancer 18 years ago. It wasn\u2019t something that she was afraid of.\u201d Tripp was a Pentagon employee in 1997 when she secretly taped conversations she had with Lewinsky, who confided in her about the affair with Clinton when she had been a White House intern. Tripp later turned over 22 hours of recordings to the special prosecutor Ken Starr, putting herself in the crosshairs of Clinton\u2019s supporters. Tripp\u2019s recordings blew the whistle on Clinton and nearly sunk his presidency \u2013 making him the second US president to be impeached. But the recordings also saw Lewinsky publicly attacked and shamed for years. After denying the affair in a sworn deposition, Clinton was impeached on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury. He was acquitted in the Senate after a 21-day trial. Murtha, Tripp\u2019s attorney, later defended Tripp against charges that she had illegally recorded the conversations and the charges were eventually dismissed. Lewinsky recounted to Barbara Walters her feelings when she learned of the secret recordings: \u201cGutted and violated and betrayed. And scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never been so afraid in my entire life. I wanted to die.\u201d Regardless, Lewinsky early Wednesday offered words of support for Tripp\u2019s family, writing on Twitter: \u201cNo matter the past, upon hearing that Linda Tripp is very seriously ill, I hope for her recovery. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this is for her family.\u201d Speaking publicly in 2018, Tripp said she had just one regret: \u201cNot having the guts to do it sooner. \u201cIt was always about right and wrong, never left and right,\u201d Tripp said at an event marking National Whistleblower Day on Capitol Hill, according to the Washington Post. \u201cIt was about exposing perjury and the obstruction of justice. It was never about politics.\u201d Talking to the Slate podcast Slow Burn in 2018, Tripp maintained that Clinton\u2019s behavior was inexcusable for anyone, \u201clet alone the leader of the free world in the Oval Office\u201d. She said the scandal didn\u2019t define her life, but she believed that if Clinton had faced stiffer penalties for his role in the scandal, the #MeToo movement that held powerful men to account would have come sooner. \u201cI think #MeToo would have been history and we would have been so much further along with ensuring that none of this happened in the workplace, making it the exception rather than the rule,\u201d Tripp said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
