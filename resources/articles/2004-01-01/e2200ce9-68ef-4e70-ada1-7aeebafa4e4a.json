Unlike rival sites, it does not sell holidays; buyers are directed to the website or telephone sales centre of the company they select. Cheapholidays.co.uk, which has been launched with 200,000 holiday deals from 120 travel companies, is an offshoot of Cheapflights Ltd, one of the top five travel sites on the web. David Soskin, chief executive of Cheapflights, said: \"We are an independent shop window that allows people to compare and contrast thousands of holiday deals in an impartial way. We are not a bargain basement although we hope to have keen prices for all types of holiday. \"There may be a trend for people to set up their own holidays but millions still prefer to take a package. A huge number still want security when spending a significant proportion of their income on their annual holiday, and many like the comfort of having a local rep.\" The site features holidays from the big four travel companies - Thomson, MyTravel, First Choice, and Thomas Cook - as well as smaller specialist companies such as Guerba and Frontier Travel. It also lists holidays from the other big travel sites, including Expedia and First Resort. It has a fast search function for the leading destinations - Spain, Greece, Cyprus and the Caribbean. Other options are divided into categories such as cheap holidays, short breaks, cruises, skiing and last-minute deals. In each case, the choices are sub-divided into departures from London and regional airports. Options are listed alphabetically in price categories, rather than by cheapness. Cheapflights.co.uk, founded in 1996, records more than one million hits a month. Cheapholidaydeals was launched after a trial on the flagship site suggested that online package holidays could attract as much interest as cheap flights. Dakota expands Ken McCulloch, founder of the Malmaison boutique hotels, is to build the second of his new chain of \"super budget\" Dakota hotels in South Queensferry, Edinburgh. The first in the chain is due to open in Ashfield, near Nottingham, in the spring. Dakota Hotels will offer services and facilities pitched between the budget hotels such as Travel Inn and boutique hotels. Rooms are expected to cost around \u00a380 per night. McCulloch sold the Malmaison chain in 2000. Seat sale MyTravelLite is selling seats for \u00a340 return, including taxes, on flights from Birmingham to four destinations: Almeria, Murcia, Faro and Palma. The sale (on mytravellite.com, 08701 564564) runs until midnight on Monday. * Helsinki and Rotterdam were the leaders in the league table of fastest-growing cities in Travelscene's annual survey. Trips to Helsinki were up 66% while Rotterdam was 47% up. More choice for disabled travellers Enable Holidays, a travel company for disabled people, their family and friends, has been launched this week with an endorsement from Scope, the national disability charity. Enable features holidays in mainstream destinations including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Florida, where a range of accommodation has been audited to ensure that the needs of people with mobility impairments are met. Hotels, apartments and resorts are graded according to their suitability for access in terms of door widths, gradients of ramps, numbers of steps and so on. Holidays can only be booked by phone (0871 2224939, enableholidays.com for information) so that advice can be tailored to individual needs. Scope, which reviewed the auditing process, receives a donation from each holiday booked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
