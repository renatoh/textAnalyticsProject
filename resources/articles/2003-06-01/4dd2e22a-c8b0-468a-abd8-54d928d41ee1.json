It was cold and dark. By car, William Morris travelled north to Birmingham where he met his mother, a widow living in one bedroom in a shared house in Handsworth. His was a typical story, the same told by thousands of Afro-Caribbeans who arrived with great optimism, the post-Windrush generation. They knew all about the opportunities in Britain. And its history, kings and queens, pomp and ceremony. 'We learnt about Francis Drake and Henry VIII at school,' Morris says now. 'No one told us much about Paul Bogle and Marcus Garvey.' Morris had lived a rural life until then. His father had five acres of land in the village of Cheapside in the Jamaican parish of Manchester. It was a one-shop venue. The nearest police station was a five-mile mule ride away. The family kept a few chickens and rabbits, and grew some crops. What you couldn't eat you sold at market and used the money to buy kerosene, clothes, a few extras for the family. Sunday was church day. Once in the morning. And once in the afternoon. In Britain he started in engineering, as his uncle had before him. Forty years of factory life and retirement, to a backdrop of Enoch Powell and rivers of blood, race riots and the rise of BNP, was before him. Morris is now in his sixties. Two weeks ago he received a knighthood. This week he will make his final speech to the annual conference of the Transport and General Workers Union before he retires in the autumn. There has been talk about him being the next governor general of his country of birth. His house in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, is a classic of the Middle England genre - short driveways with clean cars, neat flowerbeds, no rubbish. If it wasn't for the bronze Jaguar with leather seats sitting in front of the garage, you'd feel that there should be a Ford Mondeo around here somewhere. Inside the front door, by the recently delivered computer, is a small pile of Waitrose Food magazines. The overcoat on the stand is from Marks and Spencer. Sir Bill Morris has the trappings of the establishment. 'It's been a long journey,' he says with a smile as he looks over the expertly tended back garden which he himself admits is 'not much larger than a postage stamp'. He is wearing a light blue T-shirt with 'T&amp;G' stamped on the front. 'A long, long journey.' The letter from Buckingham Palace came a few weeks ago. If he were to be offered a knighthood, would he, the missive politely inquired, accept it? 'I said I wanted time to think about it. In the end I thought it's not just a recognition for myself or the union but a recognition for the causes that I've been promoting, asylum seekers and refugees. 'I'm also mindful that young black kids in Britain today, well they haven't got that many heroes - people to inspire them. And I thought, well, they may find some inspiration in me travelling a broadly similar route to the one they have travelled or are trying to follow. They would find some inspiration that would keep them on the straight and narrow. I hoped that they, like me, would see race as an inspiration and not as a barrier. So, I accepted.' The mantelpiece is overflowing with cards offering congratulations on his new title. Should I call you 'Sir Bill', I ask on arrival. 'No, no, goodness me,' he says. 'Would you like a coffee?' He sips honey and lemon. 'I never did get into that coffee thing.' In the corner of the living room is a drum from a steel band with the notes scribbled on it in felt pen. Morris is learning how to play 'Happy Birthday' for his partner, Eileen, in August. She gave him the drum two years ago and made him promise that he would practise hard. 'There is a woman at the union who plays. I think I'm going to have to call on her good nature to teach me how to do it,' he says. 'Happy Birthday' has exactly 25 notes in it. If he had started two years ago he could have learnt at the fossilised rate of one note a month. But there are the meetings, and watching his favourite, cricket, or dealing with the Labour Party, or gardening, or being a member of the Court of the Bank of England, or listening to jazz. 'I can't play any notes yet,' he says. Among the cards is one covered with the black and white image of Martin Luther King Jr. 'One day' is picked out in bold, black type. One day the children of Alabama, whether black or white, Jew or Gentile, Protestant or Catholic, will be equal. I have a dream. It is one of Morris's favourite pieces of text. When he was 10 years old, Morris thought he was going to play for the West Indies cricket team. With a green, unripe orange for a ball and a branch of the coconut tree for a bat - 'You must cut it off as close to the trunk as possible. It gives you a pretty good bat,' - Morris would play every night. 'I was going to do everything, as a starry-eyed 10-year-old. I was going to change the world before breakfast and change it back again by lunchtime.' He never played for the West Indies. But, still, he did change many things. The first black person to make it to the top of a trade union whose members, more than 30 years ago, marched in support of Powell. The man who forced the government to drop its much-hated voucher scheme for asylum seekers. The man who, when on the campaign trail for his union, saw pamphlets demanding that the union 'don't let a coon call the tune'. It has been a long journey. On that cold November morning, the day after his arrival, Morris took his first look at his new, British home in daylight. 'It was quite miserable, it looked miserable. If you can imagine, I was a 16-year-old brought up in a very rural community where everything was luscious and green, with vegetation as far as you could see. And then you looked out here and you saw these terraced houses, and they have all these little things on the top. All strange, absolutely strange. They were chimney pots. I had never seen them before. 'The whole place looked like a hostile environment. There were no trees on our street, no trees at all. Just rows and rows of houses, which all looked the same. They went on and on and on. I felt like going back to bed.' He stayed because of his mother. His father had died in Jamaica, and Morris's mother had emigrated to join her brother. 'I really wanted to go back to Jamaica. But my mother didn't want me to. I didn't want to stay at all, I didn't like the place. I wanted to go home. There weren't a lot of black people living around us. The standard of living wasn't much. I had to share a kitchen with people I didn't know. We had come from a life of freedom where we could do what we wanted.' In the 1950s, for manual workers, it was virtually compulsory to be a member of a union. So Morris joined up. After a few years, and a couple of moves, he ended up at Hardy Spicers engineering firm. He noticed that his colleagues did not have much in the way of protective clothing when handling sharp metal. So he asked a man ager about whether they could be provided with gloves and aprons. His manager agreed. It gave him the taste. 'The village I came from was the epitome of co-operation, collectivism, caring and sharing,' Morris explains. 'When the time came to plant seeds the co-operation was at its zenith.' He smiles as he remembers the history. 'The villagers would get together and draw up a roster. On Monday all the menfolk would turn up at house number one and put in the seeds. And on Tuesday they would turn up at house two. If you are there on your own, digging and digging and digging, it is boring and it takes ages. It was a simple lesson. That is where I saw collectivism and I saw a social structure and a social attitude which helped to form my life.' He knows that lessons of collectivism and co-operation do not come easily to the lips of New Labour. He likes to remind them of it, attacking the Government's record on public services, asylum policy and Iraq. He is now one of the most recognisable black faces in Britain. Politically he has a platform. Privately he has lived a life touched by other horrors. Soon after arriving in Britain, Morris met Minetta, a young Jamaican woman. It was a meeting of coincidence. Minetta came from the neighbouring parish of Clarendon and was the friend of a couple living in the same house as his mother. 'She came and visited them one weekend and that was when we first saw each other,' Morris says. 'As soon as I opened the door there was this beautiful black woman standing there, radiant by the fire. I think we both felt the same way.' They married, had a joyful life, had two children. And then, in the early 1980s, creeping and quiet, came cancer. Minetta discovered a lump in her breast and went to the hospital. She had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a mastectomy. She got better. But the cancer was not cured, as Morris believed - it was in remission. A decade later it was back, this time more virulent. As Morris remembers the time, his voice becomes steadily quieter. If he has any regrets, he now admits, it was the way he dealt with the second attack. 'I refused to accept it. I wouldn't accept it and engage. This cannot be, I thought. Yes, you are ill but you'll get better. It made me recognise the importance of communication and dialogue and caring and sharing.' So they never discussed all the things they could have done together, or all the things they should do. Morris shut some of the issues out. Too much, he now says. 'Her life was quite miserable in the end. You can see somebody who literally over the years was reduced to half her size.' He moves his hands together, palms facing each other, as if trying in some clear way to reveal what that actually means. 'That was the really hard thing to take - she was bright and she gradually shrunk.' For a Christmas present, Morris bought his wife a necklace but Minetta was so sick she could not put it on. He had to do it for her. He tells of the day she died. 'I walked down to the hospital for the afternoon visit and they called me into a room and said my wife was very ill. I again just didn't realise that it was so bad. We talked and talked and talked. I came home and then went back for the evening visit. And I left her at about 9.30 that night. At about 2am the telephone rang and the hospital said can you come down straight away, so I went down and just as I got there the sister met me and said, \"I'm sorry.\" She had died.' Minetta was one of the 'great women' in Morris's life. He talks with affection - surprising in the male-dominated world of trade unions, of the effect those women close to him have had. 'All the great influences in my life have been women. My grandmother was the mainspring of the family. She was the kind of woman who could change the world. My mother was like that as well, then Minetta and now Eileen. She is my life, she is my right and left arm. I depend on her for everything.' The doorbell rings. It's his driver, ready to take him to Harrogate on union business. Morris points out at his garden, proud of the abundance of flowers. I ask him finally about race and Britain. Many would say that this is a country with an unusual and corrosive obsession with the issue. One of constant and uncomfortable discussion. 'You really need a psychologist to tell you why we have so many hang-ups in defining the society from a race perspective when other nations see it as an asset rather than a liability,' he says. 'I still think as a nation we have made great strides - social, economic and political progress. We have a stake in the system. When I first arrived you had no stake in the system. You were a servant of the system rather than a participant. 'Where I think we may be slipping is among the conservative working class, like the average person you might find in Albert Square. The politicians haven't given any leadership. As things get worse for this group socially and economically and as deprivation spreads, for example in the mill towns of the north, people come along with easy answers and you get a snowball effect. 'Then you get the language on asylum, which is awful. The policy of trying to get offshore so-called havens [for refugees] - skulking around Somalia and Albania to take the white man's burden and we will pay them a pittance. Here we are content to go and bomb Iraq and when the Iraqis then turn up on our doorstep we say, \"Go away.\"' He is animated. Race and asylum have long been his passion and he believes the government has failed the public. I have a dream. Morris has travelled a long journey. From a five-acre smallholding to Hemel Hempstead. The day after the interview he is at Wimbledon watching Greg Rusedski smashing his racket around and swearing at the umpire. We speak again by telephone. 'What a lovely day, very different,' he says. 'But Rusedski? That was bloody bad. He should have made a public gesture of contrition.' And with that, he is gone, off to the conference in Brighton and more discussions of 'composite 43, sub-section two'. His last, in fact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
