In 1970 we were returning from a holiday in Mullion, Cornwall, with our two small children when we drove past Worthy Farm and, at a whim, my late husband decided to stop there to see what was going on. We had read in the local Bath Chronicle of the plans, so I think Norman knew what to expect, sort of! He said he would hitch a lift back, and I drove home with the boys. I honestly can\u2019t remember how long he stayed at this first Glastonbury festival, but I do recall how impressed he was to have been given a lift back to Bath by Luke Rittner, who went on to become secretary general of the Arts Council. Great memories, often recalled over the subsequent years.
