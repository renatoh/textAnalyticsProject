Given the depressed economic conjuncture, that isn't much of a surprise. But under the surface other things are happening that suggest that it may not just be a return to business as usual in the Square Mile when the market picks up again. One factor is continuing Higgs-isation. To head off more Marconis, mis-selling and other corporate mischief, regulators are prescribing ever tighter restraints on company behaviour. Higgs is only one element. Moving up from the background is the long-awaited company law review and its requirement for an operating and financial review. The accounting-for-people taskforce report in November may bring still more reporting requirements. 'The Stock Exchange changed the rules - they are not at all what we signed up for in 1971,' notes Alec Reed, chairman of Reed Executive, which recently went private after 20 years as a quoted company. While the direct cost of complying with the regulations is considerable, the indirect costs may be higher. 'Today's rules are all about policing and making sure everything is above board for shareholders,' says Reed. But if you are already above board, he reasons, the controls add no value; and at the same time they interfere with what you really want to do. The present regime is designed to protect and favour capital, he points out. But people, not capital, are the crucial factor in company success nowadays. As a private company, Reed can begin to treat its staff as real company members by working out new formulas for offering them capital-related rewards. It can also choose to spend money on developing opportunities that will come to fruition in four or five years' time, instead of paying it out to shareholders. Earnings that far ahead just aren't something the stock market values, ergo, 'the Stock Exchange isn't really relevant to entrepreneurs at all. We're better off all round being private', argues Reed. Similar concerns were voiced by Sir Richard Branson in a letter to the Financial Times this summer. He remarked that, perhaps in part because analysts specialising in a single sector prefer 'pure plays', the City has in effect put a ban on diversification. Which means that a group like Virgin, consisting of five diverse billion-pound operations in travel, leisure, music, telecoms and venture capital, simply could not have evolved except as a private company, he believes. By contrast, quoted EMI, faced with moribund music sales, was advised to hand back \u00a3500 million to shareholders rather than invest in opportunities that might have offset the decline in its core market. It used to be that companies could raise money in the City and do what they liked with it. 'Now the money part is harder and they get Higgsed to death into the bargain,' sums up Chris Brady, MBA director at Cass Business School and a keen student of the Square Mile. 'The balance has changed. If it's a choice between the money and management freedom, quite a lot of companies will choose to get the money elsewhere. Branson is a good example.' At the same time, as constraints on company behaviour are steadily tightening, share trading is taking on more and more the character of gambling - even addiction is common to both, according to an article in the FT last week. In one sense, as Brady points out, 'that's a statement of the bleeding obvious'. Stock markets have always been about gambling. Now, however, there's less and less to distinguish them. On one side the explosive growth of trading in derivatives, such as contracts for difference, brings the fast-growing spread-betting companies more and more into stock market territory, while on the other day trading carries shares into the domain of the casino. As a consequence, share prices become more volatile. And the combination of more share price volatility with sharper accountabilities is making companies themselves more volatile, and possibly harder to manage. One testimony to the increased pressures is that chief executive tenure among FTSE-100 companies is nearly down to the 39 months of the average Premiership football manager. Indeed, the two have much in common, believes Brady, himself once a professional footballer: 'Share prices make winners and losers visible, like football league tables, making them increasingly attractive to bet on.' Perhaps not surprisingly, some clubs, including even Manchester United, are thought to be considering removing themselves from some of these pressures by going private. As the risks and rewards of quoted status continue to diverge, Reed knows of several non-football businesses planning the same move. Does this matter? A moment's reflection says it does. There was already more than a hint that our financial system, with its short-termist shareholder-value obsessions, was evolving alarmingly into something inimical to good management and its need to look for success in people and continuous improvement in operations rather than deals and financial engineering. Shorn of the need to please the City, that's what many private companies do. Good for them. But quoted companies are the largest, most visible and influential actors in the economy. We need them to be as inventive and creative as possible, too. 'We're on a cusp,' says Brady. It would be the greatest of ironies if the measures devised with the aim of protecting shareholders from corporate excesses should result in shareholders having nothing to invest in at all - barring the casino, of course. simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
