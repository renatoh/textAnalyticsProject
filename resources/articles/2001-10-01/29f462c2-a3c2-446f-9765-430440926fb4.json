However, the home secretary dismissed a claim that his announcment of proposal to change the law on cannabis had been timed deliberately to be overshadowed by the IRA's gesture on weapons. The candid confession that the dark arts of spin doctoring had gone too far came hours after three Labour MPs had voted with the Conservatives, and several others abstained, over Stephen Byers's refusal to sack his spin specialist, Jo Moore, for her suggestion that September 11 would be a good day to bury bad news. Mr Blunkett, responding to suspicion of the timing of his announcement, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I deliberately didn't spin this. I didn't put it out at the weekend, I didn't put a line on it. I do what people want, which is to announce it to a parliamentary forum\" - the select committee to which he was giving evidence on Tuesday. However, the home secretary, not an unqualified admirer of Downing Street's media operation, added: \"I think we've become obsessed with the method of getting information into the arena. I mean collectively - the media, politicians themselves, including me - all of us have been obsessed with the nature of the delivery of the message, rather than the message.\" On Tuesday night, three Labour MPs - Paul Marsden, Tam Dalyell and Jeremy Corbyn - voted with the Tories against Ms Moore's retention on the trade department payroll. The government won by 340 to 167, as the Lib Dems abstained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
