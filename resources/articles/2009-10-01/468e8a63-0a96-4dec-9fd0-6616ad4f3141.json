A total of 82 horses ran in Hemmings's green and yellow quartered colours last season, but Mick Meagher, his racing manager, said yesterday that like many owners Hemmings is trimming his string to reflect economic conditions. \"I'd think that there would be about 45 in training this season,\" Meagher said. \"I'd say there might have been 70 in training at any one time last year, but there would not have been 82 in training at any stage. Horses get sold, they get injuries, and so on.\" Hemmings has won many of the sport's top races, including the 2005 Grand National with Hedgehunter and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2005 with Trabolgan. His extensive list of trainers includes Paul Nicholls, Alan King Venetia Williams, Nicky Richards and Sue Smith. Tataniano, a useful novice hurdler last season, made a successful debut over fences at Exeter yesterday and is now on course to contest the Independent Newspaper Novice Chase at Cheltenham's Open meeting next month. Nicholls's five-year-old is a 14-1 chance for the Arkle Trophy at the Festival meeting with VC Bet. \"This is a nice race to win and we can now head to the Paddy Power meeting and have a go at the other good ones,\" Nicholls said. \"He has only been in the indoor school at home so that is his first time jumping fences on grass and his first piece of fast work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
