Fresh from dealing with Scholes's refusal to take part in Monday's Worthington Cup tie at Arsenal, Ferguson's mood will inevitably be darkened once again by the latest show of dissent from within his own camp. Silvestre has already criticised United's tactics this season and, in an interview with a French magazine, the defender openly disagrees with Ferguson's assessment of the team's defensive problems. \"We have let in lots of goals since the start of the season and according to the manager the problems stem from the centre of defence,\" says the French international. \"I have sat through videos of our matches with the manager but I don't agree with the theories he puts forward.\" Silvestre goes on to question why he has been omitted from United's team for some of their biggest matches so far this season. \"Alex Ferguson repeatedly opts to play Denis Irwin and that is something I find really hard to cope with,\" he says. \"However, I will hold myself back for the time being. I need to keep calm. It would be idiotic to blow a fuse but I've strung together some good performances so I feel somewhat bitter about our difficult start to the season.\" Coming in the aftermath of Scholes's uneasy truce with Ferguson, Silvestre's criticism will add to the foreboding inside Old Trafford following their problematic early-season form. Although dismayed by Scholes's initial attitude, Ferguson has decided against prolonging the spat and has withdrawn his threat of further disciplinary action rather than risk alienating one of the players best equipped to salvage a faltering season. While a training-ground row with David Beckham last year led to him being left out of a crucial match against Leeds, Ferguson has let off Scholes with nothing more than a strongly worded reminder about the order of power at Old Trafford. It is the first time in his career that Scholes, usually such a loyal and mild-mannered individual, has challenged Ferguson's authority and United's critics have seized upon it as being a sign of weakness in the manager's final season in charge. However, it is clear that Ferguson, in accepting the player's apology, has also taken into account the intense pressure the England international must feel after struggling to adapt to United's new tactics following the summer recruitment of Juan Sebastian Veron and Ruud van Nistelrooy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
