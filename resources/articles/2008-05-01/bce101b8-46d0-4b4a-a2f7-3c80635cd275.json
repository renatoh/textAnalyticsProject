Then it seemed that Jose Mourinho had bought up the rights to the future with Roman Abramovich's money. Now Manchester United are champions for a second successive season after picking their way with care through a difficult afternoon at Wigan. Chelsea have not been routed yet and the rueful expressions at the close of the draw with Bolton Wanderers will not linger for long. They still have the chance of trumping their rivals by beating them to the Champions League trophy in Moscow on May 21. Whatever happens at the Luzhniki Stadium, however, the United manager has already regenerated his club. Retaining the title proves Ferguson truly has opened up a new phase. Coming off second best to Chelsea for a couple of years was as instructive to him as it was painful. A different sort of team had been demanded of him and he showed that he could operate in new ways. Strict emulation of Mourinho's approach would not have been to Ferguson's taste. Neither would it have been tolerated at Old Trafford, where attacking football is both a heritage and a commercial necessity for a club that markets itself as adventurers. There are United fans who will say that the most fun they have had, week after week, was in the season that followed the treble of 1999. The team piled up 97 goals in the league. Conversely opponents scored 45 times against the title-winners. That kind of jamboree was never going to become an established method and eventually Chelsea made discipline the key. It is easy to see that United have become meaner and the concentration at the JJB Stadium had to be intense until Ryan Giggs's goal confirmed the win. This side has established a new defensive record for the club in a history of league football dating back 116 years. The team has conceded 22 goals whereas United's previous best effort in the Premier League, set in 1997-98 and equalled last year, was 27. That stringency, though, could not be achieved if it entailed a high cost to the expressiveness of the whole team. There had to be a compromise. While United vary their tactics, Ferguson has followed the trend by fielding a single outright striker. There have to be 10 men behind the ball as quickly as possible once possession is lost. Where United remain vivacious is in having such expressive talent in the deeper areas. Cristiano Ronaldo, for instance, normally has to drop back but that might allow him a few yards of space in which to take a pass and start running. There has been sufficient liberty for the Portuguese to pile up 31 goals in the league alone during the present campaign. Elsewhere United now get the best out of the veteran Paul Scholes by employing him near the centre-halves as a sort of Salford Pirlo. The continuity of achievement comes for United despite the fact that an era is ending at Old Trafford. Of the outstanding bunch of footballers and club servants who first came to the fore in the 1990s the few that remain realise that the countdown to the close of their careers is far advanced. Gary Neville, 33, has had such difficulty in recovering from an ankle injury that he has spent only nine minutes on the pitch since March 2007. Nothing so drastic has happened to Scholes, 33, or Ryan Giggs, 34, but their appearances will be rationed with increasing strictness. The Welshman will value yesterday's goal all the more for that reason. There is work to come for Ferguson. Since Porto's Jose Boswinga seems bound for Chelsea, another candidate has to be identified to take over the right-back role that used to belong to Neville, but it is an undertaking fully to replace people for whom United is part of their very being. Though the manager has squared up to that task, the pitfalls are apparent. For every Ronaldo there will be many who never quite reach the required standard or who turn out to be a cause of concern. Perfection is hardly glimpsed let alone reached in football and the questions keep on coming. It will be asked, for instance, if the 37-year-old Edwin van der Sar is robust enough for another season. There are trials to beset a manager at every club but Ferguson's domination persists because he has the will and mental suppleness to go on finding the right answers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
