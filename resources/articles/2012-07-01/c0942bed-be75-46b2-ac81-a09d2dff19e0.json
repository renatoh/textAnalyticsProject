And between Dafoe's quiet charisma, the eerie wilderness landscapes and the rich symbolism, there's plenty to hold the attention. Dafoe has been hired by a pharmaceutical company to retrieve samples of the rumoured tiger (which was actually hunted to extinction by the 1930s), but he's constantly being dragged out of the bush and back to town \u2013 for warming encounters with his hostess (Frances O'Connor) and run-ins with local loggers and eco-warriors, and a dash of corporate conspiracy. These subplots flesh out the story, but deflate the tension. Still, Dafoe is eminently watchable, and for the most part it's a distinctive, atmospheric movie that cherishes the persistence of mystery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
