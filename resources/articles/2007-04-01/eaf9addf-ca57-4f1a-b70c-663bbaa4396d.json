They have legal permission to divide the plot into two separate properties, but have not yet done so. They now wish to gift us the main house - their principal private residence for many years - because they are moving to another area, but want to retain the smaller house. Is there a tax problem with them dividing the properties and then giving the larger house and land to us, or would it be preferable for them to gift the whole plot with both houses as it now is, and then have us divide it and gift back the smaller property and land? My parents are in their early 70s and my wife and I are in our late 30s. SD A Before doing anything, your parents would be well-advised to get both professional tax and legal advice as there are three possible tax problems. First, if the property your parents intend to transfer to you is worth more than \u00a3125,000 in the 2007-08 tax year, the transfer will attract stamp duty land tax. Second, the fact that your parents are planning to give you what has been their principal private residence should mean they qualify for private residence relief and are exempt from capital gains tax. However, there may still be a capital gains tax bill if the garden and grounds that come with the house exceed half a hectare (a little more than one acre). For this reason, it would seem better to split the plot before making the gift. You can find out more about the rules relating to garden and grounds in a free help sheet published by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Third, depending on the value of the property, there may be inheritance tax to pay if either of your parents died within seven years of them giving you the house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
