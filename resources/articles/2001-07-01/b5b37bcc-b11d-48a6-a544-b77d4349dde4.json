Football and finance sources claimed yesterday that McManus and Magnier will increase their shareholding in United from the current 6.77% to just over 10%, a move which is likely to cost another \u00a320m. News that the wealthy Irish duo had already spent \u00a330m on their holding caught both the club and the football world by surprise on Wednesday. The move is rumoured to have strengthened the position of Sir Alex Ferguson - who is close friends with both McManus and Magnier - in his long-running dispute with the United board and their chairman Martin Edwards. It is believed that McManus and Magnier will buy more shares through their Cubic Expression Company, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, in an attempt to become more powerful at Old Trafford than Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, which owns 9.99% of the club. News of the increased shareholding was welcomed yesterday by Shareholders United, the powerful group of independent United shareholders who were instrumental in preventing the club being taken over by BSkyB. In total, 19.78% of United shares are owned by individuals, the majority of them fans. McManus and Magnier are now expected to meet representatives of the group over the coming weeks and their spokesman, Oliver Houston, said yesterday that \"lines of communication\" had already been opened with the Irish duo. Houston added: \"We are relieved to find out that Cubic Expression are a business coalition of well-known United fans and not a corporate predator. We hope that we have interests in common and that we will be able to work together in the future for the benefit of all supporters of the football club.\" However, while the Irish duo publicly declared their involvement in the Cubic Expression Company through a statement yesterday, there was speculation about who else might be involved in the venture. Both McManus and Magnier are close associates of Dermot Desmond, the largest shareholder in Celtic. However, according to Uefa rules, a company or individual cannot own shares in two clubs that are in the same competition and both United and Celtic are in this season's Champions League. Desmond also said recently that he was keen to see Celtic play in the Premiership. Speculation has also been rife that Ferguson could also be involved in the Cubic Expression Company and could become chairman if a takeover was successful. But a spokesman for McManus and Magnier denied that anybody else apart from the duo are involved in the company. The spokesman also denied that the Irish pair had long-term ambitions to take over United. So far, Magnier and McManus have not approached the former chief executive Edwards, now chairman of the football club board, with a view to buying his 6% stake, and have not requested a seat on the plc board, although the situation could change if they increase their shareholding. Yesterday Manchester United's shares rose 0.5p to 173p, valuing the club at \u00a3449m. Earlier this month, before the first rumours of a big buyer started to circulate in the City, the shares were changing hands at just 147p, valuing the club at \u00a3380m. Officials of United said yesterday that they had received behind-the-scenes assurances from Ferguson that he was not set on a course of action that would eventually see him emerge as the most powerful off-the-pitch figure at Old Trafford. Yet the United manager is unlikely to forget quickly that just weeks ago the men who employ him were prepared to see him leave the club at the end of his managerial tenure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
