Its analysis of possession notices issued over the last year suggests 215,000 homes in England are at risk of eviction or repossession and it warned rising interest rates would bring more households under threat. The research revealed hotspots where people are most likely to face losing their home with Newham in London at the top of the list and Salford the \"eviction and repossession risk capital of the north\". London boroughs dominate the repossession risk list, but Nottingham and Peterborough also feature in the top 20, according to the research based on Ministry of Justice data on homeowners and private or social renters receiving a possession notice for their home \u2013 the first stage in a process which can end with the loss of a home. \"These staggering figures show just how many families go through the trauma of learning that their home is at risk, every single week,\" said Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb. \"People are hearing that the economy is recovering, but we're seeing the reality that many families across the country are still battling to keep their heads above water and keep their homes. Just one thing such as a job loss or serious illness can tip any of us into a downward spiral that puts our home at risk.\" Shelter said its free advice helpline was taking more than 480 calls each day, offering support and advice to homeless families and those fighting to stay in their homes. \"Getting advice early is the best way to halt the spiral of rent or mortgage arrears and can mean the difference between losing a home and keeping it,\" added Robb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
