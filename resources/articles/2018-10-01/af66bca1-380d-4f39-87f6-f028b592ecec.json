The 21-year-old\u2019s beautiful second-half free-kick earned a victory that sent Wales to the top of their Nations League group and condemned the Republic of Ireland to bottom place. It also lit up an otherwise gruelling spectacle that intensified the pressure on Martin O\u2019Neill. The Republic manager was hoping for a vibrant performance that would atone for his team\u2019s sorry 4-1 defeat by Wales last month. He told them to \u201cshow you can play, take the game by the scruff of the neck\u201d. They tried but rarely came close. Individuals in green made basic mistakes for which their manager could scarcely be blamed but collectively there seemed to be a haphazardness that did not reflect well on anyone involved with the home team. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the endeavour but endeavour alone is not enough. We lacked a little bit of quality,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who insisted he can lead the Irish to qualification for Euro 2020, especially if players such as Seamus Coleman and Robbie Brady return from injuries, adding that he continually reviews his abilities and remains convinced he will plot a successful path forward. \u201cI\u2019ve never not asked questions of myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI take responsibility for every kick made on that field by us. That\u2019s my job. That will not change in terms of questioning. I do question everything that happens on the field. I\u2019ll look back on the field to see if there are things we could have done better.\u201d Both managers had promised to be bold in their approach and Giggs\u2019s lineup backed up his words. He gave first international starts to a couple of teenagers, Leeds\u2019s Tyler Roberts leading the attack while Matt Smith began in midfield. The experienced Sam Vokes and Andy King would have been safer options in the absence of Bale and Ramsey but Giggs put his confidence in youth as part of a plan to use speed and movement to pull Ireland apart. Their was little trace of such sharpness from either side during a first half when the ball drifted to and fro like a plastic bag in a fickle breeze. An error led to Ireland\u2019s best chance, Smith miscontrolling at the edge of his box as Wales tried to play out from the back. Christie pounced on the error and sent a hasty curling shot towards the bottom corner, only for Wayne Hennessey to push it around the post. Injuries for both sides meant half of the participants are more commonly seen in the Championship and the match was distinctly second rate but Wales raised the standard in the second half. Wilson contributed the classiest moment in the 56th minute after an almost laughable tackle by Harry Arter at the edge of the box. Any Ireland fans thankful that Bale was not around to take the free-kick must have forgotten about the masterpiece produced by Wilson for Derby against Manchester United last month. He served up another, dispatching the free-kick into the top-right corner past a mystified Darren Randolph. \u201cI thought about fining him after he scored at Old Trafford but I won\u2019t be fining him now,\u201d said Giggs, jokingly. Ireland tried to brew up a storm. Jeff Hendrick unloaded a shot after dainty footwork in the box but it was straight at Hennessey. Everything seemed a little aimless from the hosts and Wales would have inflicted more damage if Tom Lawrence and James Chester had finished better. \u201cWe played some really good stuff,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cBut the thing I\u2019m most proud about was that clean sheet, the will to defend and put their bodies on the line.\u201d While hailing the contribution of his young players, he said the best player was a 34-year-old who came into the game on the back of criticism for recent displays. \u201cAshley Williams was outstanding, man of the match by a million miles. I get asked all the time about the young players coming in but the older, experienced one are just as important.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
