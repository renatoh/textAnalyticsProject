Having lived a beach-and-study lifestyle in Cape Town, and a work-and-ski lifestyle in Canada, I have had some time to ponder this. If you immerse yourself in something you love, it can begin to lose its allure. A leisure lifestyle has its limitations - and more problems than you might think. The feeling of routine and \"office politics\" that affect any workplace are just as rife in a ski school. We strive for challenge and variety: these are built into the idea of a holiday and consequently away-time will always appeal. From school onwards we are conditioned to working 9-to-5 just to go on holiday. This is pretty hard to shake, even if you believe a better lifestyle exists. As I attempt to settle happily here in London, I am still a subscriber to escapism. But I also firmly believe no amount of time in the world's most beautiful locations will solve your problems for you. Tasha Lubbe London \u00b7 How very odd - you didn't interview anyone holidaying in the world's largest democracy, India. My wife and I went to Kerala in February; it is a great place for Brits to holiday and it helps the local economy no end. Joe Phillips Bingham, Notts \u00b7 Thank you for showing us so many happy Brits abroad. Would you now please show us happy Brits at home - in the garden; by the river; at their allotments. This would be a truly unique photographic record. But you had better hurry before the sun goes in.
