More than 70% of the revenue raised from direct tax and benefit changes announced in the emergency budget came from women. The latest coalition revenue-raiser, removing child benefit from families in which one earner pays higher-rate tax, falls nearly 100% on women (and 100% on children). Iain Duncan Smith says that an alternative would have been to raise taxes, which people wouldn't have liked either. Has he forgotten that non-parents and men pay income tax too, so any such tax rise would be much smaller since spread more widely? A tax rise would also not have impacted on those women looking after children full-time who have no other income of their own, while removing child benefit will leave most without any money of their own at all. Susan Himmelweit Professor of economics, Open University \u2022 Why is this one measure being aired now and not on 20 October along with all the other cuts. When you want to show you're courageously hitting the better-off, you don't want it buried among all the bad news to come for the unemployed, the low-paid and the poorer welfare claimants. Trumpet the child benefit assault now and you will for ever be able to say you're hitting the rich as well as the poor, and to keep up the mantra that we're all in this together. We used to call it a smokescreen. Steve Shaw Bude, Cornwall \u2022 How brave of the coalition to aim its first big cut at a demographic that includes newspaper columnists. The outrage is entirely predictable. Meanwhile most ordinary families are feeling only pleasant surprise that the wealthy are indeed going to be asked to share in the necessary pain. Richard Miller Whitstable, Kent \u2022 Yvette Cooper's alternative to Osborne's plan is to raise more tax from the banks. It could be the opposition's response to any of the cuts. No need to worry about intellectual honesty, just bash the banks. The banks should pay more tax, but why is Labour talking about this now, rather than in 1997, 1998, 1999 ... Is it possible that welfare cuts are now necessary precisely because New Labour encouraged the worst kinds of casino banking and tax avoidance? Matthew Roberts Rugby \u2022 Martin Narey's views on our benefits system might be less repugnant if he didn't earn \u00a3166,000 as chief executive of Barnardos (Comment, 4 October). If he is so concerned about children living in poverty, then why does he take a city salary from a children's charity?
