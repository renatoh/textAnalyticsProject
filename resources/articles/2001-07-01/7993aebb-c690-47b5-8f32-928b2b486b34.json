The specialist stockbroker in internet investments - which backed Demon and Autonomy - said it will report \"a substantial trading loss\" for the year to June 30. Durlacher said that it would also consider some \"substantial write-downs\" against the cost of its portfolio of investments in new technology companies. Investors believe that a recovery in Durlacher's share price recovery depends on the success of those companies. Shareholders nursing paper losses on a stock that once traded at 440p, but now changes hands for pennies, will have been cheered by the announcement that Durlacher has renegotiated the terms of a funding agreement. Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 4.75p. In November last year, the company secured a possible \u00a330m in new funds from the issue of two convertible bonds. It has drawn down \u00a315m of the available money. After talks with investors, it has renegotiated the remaining bond at well above the present share price level. Shareholders had feared their stakes might be severely diluted by the original terms. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we wouldn't have negotiated the original terms if we had known the technology, media and telecoms market was going to fall out as it did,\" said the chief executive, Geoffrey Chamberlain. \"This [renegotiation] removes a big black cloud overhanging our stock.\" Durlacher said it would continue to back technology companies, but Mr Chamberlain admitted \"we haven't invested in anything new for four or five months.\" The company's prospects depend largely on realising the value from investments in companies which include the email archiving specialist K-Vault Software, the online brokerage Nothingventured.com and the technology website The451.com. Stock market turbulence and a lack of appetite in the markets for technology shares makes a series of flotations likely. Trade sales seem the most likely route. Analysts also speculate that Durlacher could play a role in the continued consolidation of the sector, which has seen several internet investment vehicles merge or be taken over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
