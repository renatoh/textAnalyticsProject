Julia Ogiehor, from east London, who represents Muswell Hill on Haringey council described how two men sat down opposite her and began interrogating her about her heritage as she travelled home on Friday night. She said they refused to accept she had lived in the capital her entire life before guessing \u201cwhere in Africa they thought I was from\u201d. \u201cThey said you\u2019re clearly not from here, where are your family from?\u201d Ogiehor told the Guardian. \u201cI said it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d According to Ogiehor, the two white men said they were from Liverpool after a fellow commuter intervened and sat next to her, before the men accused her of being \u201cashamed\u201d of where she was from. \u201cOne of them called me uneducated, and looked like I didn\u2019t go to university,\u201d Ogiehor said. \u201cI had my hands up saying I do not want to speak to you any more, then one of the guys tried to pull my hands down and demanded I get out of his sight. \u201cI recoiled and said please do not touch me, as he kept saying I had no common sense and that I was uneducated at the top of his voice. I was the only black person in the carriage and he seemed to expect everyone would be on their side. They seemed to be a little taken aback when that was not the case.\u201d She added: \u201cThey had such a sense of entitlement and sounded offended that I refused to go into my heritage and did indeed come from London.\u201d Ogiehor said she has had enough of being asked this question, which happens quite often. \u201cI\u2019m as British as you are,\u201d she told the men. \u201cYou do not have the right to ask me these questions.\u201d She claimed she had been attacked previously while travelling on the underground and called on people to \u201cspeak up\u201d if they ever witnessed people being harassed. \u201cThe fact I was helped is what gave me the courage to defend myself,\u201d she said. \u201cHate crime is under-reported, so please speak up. They are the minority, and we need to stand up to bigotry.\u201d At the time of writing, Ogiehor said the police were en route to her house to take a detailed statement. British Transport Police have been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
