The shows are a spin-off from The Red Hand Files, the regular emails he sends to fans, in which he answers questions about meaty subjects such as God, evil and grief. (A moving post about the death of his teenage son, Arthur, went viral last November.) \u201cIt\u2019s about intimacy and connectedness,\u201d Cave says tonight, introducing the unusual setup. Between the interactions he plays piano-only versions of his songs, the choices dictated by random requests and the chat that emerges. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says. Cave whippets around the stage in a golden-brown suit. A mix of people sit on chairs behind him, AA-meeting style; they have been selected indiscriminately, he says \u2013 \u201cThey haven\u2019t got VIP passes.\u201d Ushers with microphones roam the crowd as hands fly up. Initially, the exchanges resemble unburdenings to a preacher. A woman who lost her daughter to a brain tumour thanks him for playing God Is in the House. A lifelong fan tells him about his terminal cancer, and how he\u2019d often fall asleep during treatment before hearing his favourite song, Jubilee Street, on 2013\u2019s Push the Sky Away. But, after delivering his sympathies tenderly, Cave jokes, \u201cSlap him awake\u201d before singing the song beautifully. Cave makes a convincing standup. He has the best answer for someone who asks if his wife can cuddle him (\u201cJoin the queue, love\u201d) and goes full Bernard Manning answering a question about working away (\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me at home after two weeks\u201d). There are also some curveballs. \u201cWhat\u2019s occurring?\u201d asks a Gavin and Stacey fan (\u201cIs that Welsh?\u201d), while another fan bizarrely duels with him about the koala, his favourite animal. \u201cIt\u2019d tear your face off,\u201d Cave rails. The glut of fans professing adoration gets wearing, but Cave\u2019s nuanced thoughts about art and morality, songwriting and stage nerves are fascinating. When he confesses to talking to Arthur each night before going on stage, you can hear a pin drop. \u201cTo go on stage with that person: all fear evaporates. Nothing can go wrong because everything has gone wrong.\u201d His singing is also extraordinary in this intimate setting. A double header of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Avalanche (the first song he loved) and The Mercy Seat takes your breath away. So do versions of Brompton Oratory and Into My Arms from 1997\u2019s The Boatman\u2019s Call, his whispers as controlled as his velvety bellows. But the best moment is the rawest. Asked to perform a Grinderman track, he plays Palaces of Montezuma (\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before\u201d), messes it up, starts again and nails it. \u201cThat was awesome!,\u201d he cheers, and it is. We\u2019re there with him entirely, just as he wanted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
