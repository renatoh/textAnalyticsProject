The Tories want \u00a39,000 per journalist for the three week campaign, Labour \u00a38,750, and the Liberal Democrats are charging \u00a35,000; the latter are also charging \u00a3500 for a day with Mr Kennedy. The parties defend the charges as being \"as much as the market will bear\". They also say that it it is expensive to organise the trips, involving hiring planes and helicopters. The electoral commission, a new body that will supervise the funding and conduct of elections and referendums, is likely to press for a breakdown of the tour costs. Otherwise it will class part of the payments as party donations. This could lead to all sorts of complications. News International, owner of the Times and the Sun, and a quoted stock exchange company, needs approval from shareholders to make donations. Foreign journalists could also be hit. Under the new strict rules party donations are banned from foreigners, although those from European Union companies will be exempt. A ruling from the commission that part of the charge is a donation might force the parties to cut their charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
