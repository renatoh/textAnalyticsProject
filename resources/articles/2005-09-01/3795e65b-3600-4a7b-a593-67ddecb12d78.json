John Tyndall, perhaps the finest of all Victorian mountain writers, might have been describing this peak when he refers to \"pillars, and towers, and splintered obelisks, grand in their coarseness ... a gigantic ruin\". My main objective that day was to peer over the north-eastern end of the summit ridge and see if there was a feasible route along the undulating aerial skyway that unites the sharp upthrusts of individual peaks beyond. It soon became obvious that there was no weakness in the mountain's defences that way - the only solution to penetrate the battlements of Drumannler and Wyssi Flue is up one or other of the steep, green spurs that fall to the Adelboden valley. Mission accomplished, I went on down the piled and tottering screes that line the steep floor of Ruggi-Talti directly beneath more insecure towers of shale. The heat of this year's early summer had almost entirely removed the usual snowfield in the bed of this high corrie, making for a slow descent over the heaped remains of earlier rockfalls. Debris of mountain foundations gave way to steep vegetation and I marvelled at the metamorphosis from bare rock to richly blessed alpine meadow. It was now easier to climb down a dry rock gully where I soon came upon the back legs of a fallen chamois: 50 feet lower was the rest of the beast, presumably washed down by spring melt water and since picked clean by carrion consumers. Unfortunately its horns had broken off and were lost - disappointing me that I couldn't add them to my collection of horns and antlers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
