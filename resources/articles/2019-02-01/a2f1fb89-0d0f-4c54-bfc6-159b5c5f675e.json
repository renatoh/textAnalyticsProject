It meant that despite ending the game with 10 men following Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi\u2019s red card, and so being without him and the suspended Fernandinho for the second leg, they remain favourites to progress to the quarter-finals. All of this came despite a controversial VAR decision to award Schalke the first of two penalties that had appeared likely to give them victory. For San\u00e9, a former Schalke player, his strike \u2013 a stunning 85th-minute free-kick \u2013 was particularly sweet. \u201cIt means a lot. I was a little bit sad for Schalke because the atmosphere was amazing like it always is,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see the will is a lot, we never give up, we always want to keep fighting.\u201d Pep Guardiola\u2019s notable selection move was deploying Fernandinho at centre-back, as he did for this month\u2019s win over Arsenal. There were two changes from the 6-0 Premier League hiding of Chelsea, with the injured John Stones replaced by Otamendi and David Silva chosen ahead of Oleksandr Zinchenko, who dropped to the bench. Domenico Tedesco, Schalke\u2019s 33-year-old coach, selected the former City centre-back Matija Nastasic, with Rabbi Matondo, who left the Etihad last month, as a substitute. At a packed and vibrant Veltins Arena, Sergio Ag\u00fcero made a hash of the first chance, mistiming a shot, then a slick free-kick routine that wrong-footed the defence ended in an Ag\u00fcero header being tipped over by Ralf F\u00e4hrmann. A second corner followed and, though Schalke cleared, they looked shaky. A factor here was Tedesco arranging Schalke in a 5-4-1 that invited City on and meant ceding the initiative. The invitation to play attack-versus-defence soon led to an Ag\u00fcero pot-shot and the City midfield of Raheem Sterling, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva took control. Schalke were restricted to aerial attacks, as when Daniel Oczipka\u2019s cross tested Fernandinho, who headed clear. When City took the lead they had David Silva\u2019s persistence to thank. After Schalke played themselves into difficulties, he hunted down Salif San\u00e9, stole the ball and squared it to Ag\u00fcero, who did not miss. City soon came close to doubling the lead. Fernandinho made an interception and strode forward before delivering a defence-shredding ball into David Silva. The Spaniard turned this to Sterling but, instead of taking aim, he dawdled and his return to David Silva allowed the hosts to escape. City looked far from watertight, though, when Schalke actually came at them. There was the concerning sight of Aymeric Laporte going to ground as Weston McKennie roved into the area and, though he did not touch the American, the Frenchman received a stern talking-to from Guardiola. Then disaster struck and it followed De Bruyne losing possession \u2013 a collector\u2019s item \u2013 near halfway. This led to a shot from Caligiuri, at which point VAR intervened. The effort hit Otamendi\u2019s right arm and Schalke appealed for a penalty. There followed near-farce as, while awaiting the verdict, the referee, Carlos del Cerro Grande, had a long chat with the captains, F\u00e4hrmann and David Silva. Finally, after a three-minute delay, Del Cerro Grande pointed to the penalty spot and Nabil Bentaleb sent Ederson the wrong way. Nor was this the end of the first-half drama. At a free-kick Fernandinho was booked for pulling back Salif San\u00e9 \u2013 meaning he misses the return leg \u2013 and a second penalty was awarded. Up stepped Bentaleb again to give Schalke a 2-1 lead. City had to regroup for the second half. They began brightly, with De Bruyne\u2019s snap-shot followed by a City break when Ag\u00fcero found Sterling, who ran up a blind alley and was dispossessed. Ag\u00fcero was culpable of the same error a little later. But these chances derived because City pinged the ball around in the manner their manager always demands. Lacking was end product. Composure before goal had to be rediscovered yet the quality was absent when Otamendi felled Guido Burgstaller on 68 minutes and was shown a second yellow. Towards the end Guardiola replaced Ag\u00fcero with San\u00e9 and it was the German, with that superb long-range set piece, then Sterling, collecting Ederson\u2019s long pass and poking neatly past F\u00e4hrmann as the clock ticked towards 90 minutes, who made the trip home for City far more enjoyable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
