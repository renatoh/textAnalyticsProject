The \u00a326m striker has scored only four goals in all competitions this season and plumbed new depths of despair when blazing over the crossbar from five yards in Tottenham\u2019s 4-2 FA Cup replay win against Burnley. \u201cIt\u2019s not about psychology,\u201d the Spurs manager said when asked if his striker might be well served by seeing a psychologist. \u201cWe see the player and the people and the holistic situation. It\u2019s about all, not a case to fix to bring in a psychologist from outside. The better psychology for him is we are the people all the time with him. We need to find the strange thing that happens in his game.\u201d Tottenham entertain Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday and Pochettino was equally quick to dismiss the notion that dropping the Spaniard might crush his fragile confidence. \u201cNo, because he knows that there\u2019s opportunities for all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of games ahead and it\u2019s not a question if you miss a chance whether you play or not play. If I decide tomorrow he will go to the bench, it will not affect his confidence. \u201cI am very happy with all players. I am happy with Harry Kane because he scores. I am happy with Soldado; he didn\u2019t score but I am happy too. I am happy with [Emmanuel] Adebayor.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s former player Jermain Defoe is expected to make his debut for Sunderland, having spent recent weeks training with the Spurs development squad. If Pochettino was concerned about his record of scoring debut goals for every club he has played for, he hid it well. \u201cAll the best for Jermain in his new era in his career,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways we need to be focused on our players but Defoe is a big finisher and a very good striker. He showed his quality here and in the last season at Toronto but we have three great strikers and we are confident in our players.\u201d Pochettino showed his confidence by confirming that Adebayor would return to his match-day squad having regained his fitness and \u201ctrained well\u201d in recent weeks after having compassionate leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
