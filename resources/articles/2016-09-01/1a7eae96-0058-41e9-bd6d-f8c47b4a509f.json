Jane Haining is the only Scot named as \u201crighteous among the nations\u201d \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from the Nazis \u2013 by Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial. Her will, which bequeaths \u201cmoney left after meeting funeral expenses\u201d along with her wireless, typewriter, fur coat and watches, was found in a box in the archives of the Church of Scotland\u2019s World Mission Council in Edinburgh. The box also held about 70 photographs of Haining with her young charges, and documents revealing efforts to secure her release from the Nazi death camp. The material is to be handed over to the National Library of Scotland. The Rev Ian Alexander, secretary of the World Mission Council, said Haining\u2019s story was \u201cone of heroism and personal sacrifice\u201d. The discovery of a will \u201cgives a sense she was fully aware of the risks she was taking\u201d, he said. \u201cScottish missionaries were advised to return home from Europe during the dark days of the second world war, but Jane declined and wrote: \u2018If these children need me in days of sunshine, how much more do they need me in days of darkness?\u2019\u201d She \u201cembodies so much of the internationalist spirit\u201d, he added. Haining moved to Budapest in the early 1930s to work as a matron in a church-run school after a sheltered childhood on a farm and 10 years working as a secretary. Many of the 315 pupils at the school were girls from the city\u2019s growing Jewish population. In 1939, when war broke out, Haining was on holiday in Cornwall but immediately returned to Budapest and her charges. A year later she was ordered by the church to return to Scotland, but refused. A Hungarian bishop, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ravasz, later reported that \u201cher superiors three times ordered her home, but she always replied that the Hungarian people were so true-hearted, honourable and chivalrous that among them not a hair on her head would be touched. \u2018I shall continue to do my duty,\u2019 she declared, \u2018and stick to my post.\u2019\u201d When Nazi troops entered Budapest in March 1944, she again rejected entreaties to leave, instead sewing yellow stars on to the clothes of Jewish girls on Gestapo orders. Within weeks, the Gestapo arrested her on suspicion of spying, giving her 15 minutes to gather her belongings. Haining was charged with eight offences, including listening to news broadcasts on the BBC. By May she was in Auschwitz, working in the labour camps, and by August she was dead. Her British citizenship meant the Nazis sent a death certificate to the Church of Scotland; it said Haining had died of \u201ccachexia following intestinal catarrh\u201d. More than a million people died in the Auschwitz concentration camps before they were liberated by Russian troops in January 1945. As well as being honoured by Yad Vashem in 1997, after a 10-year investigation, Haining was posthumously awarded a Hero of the Holocaust medal by the UK government in 2010. Two glass windows bear tribute to her \u201cservice and sacrifice\u201d at her former church in Queen\u2019s Park, Glasgow. A street in Budapest is named after her. Rev Susan Brown of the World Mission Council said: \u201cThe previously unseen documents and photographs have, for me, evoked fresh feelings of awe about this already tremendously moving, inspiring and important story. To hear of Jane\u2019s determination to continue to care for \u2018her\u2019 girls, even when she knew it put her own life at risk, is truly humbling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
