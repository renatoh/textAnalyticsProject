He stopped and let the pursuer climb back aboard. A minute later Fabien Barthez re-emerged, clutching that little bag in which footballers keep their most intimate accoutrements. \"He must have dropped it,\" a derisive scouse voice shouted from the depths of the throng surrounding the coach. Three hours later Barthez had dropped, or at least failed to catch, something rather more vital. His inability to claim possession of John Arne Riise's long throw from the left six minutes into the second half allowed Emile Heskey to flick the ball high into the goalmouth, presenting Liverpool with an immediate chance to reverse the flow of a game that had suddenly threatened to flow United's way. A couple of minutes earlier David Beckham had brought the champions back into contention at 2-1, momentarily undermining Phil Thompson's half-time sermon on the importance of maintaining total concentration. Remember, Liverpool's acting manager told his players, that Tottenham Hotspur had been leading United by 3-0 a few weeks ago, only to find themselves overwhelmed. But now, just as the visitors' hopes had been raised, Barthez's vain dash allowed Michael Owen to head the goal that killed United's hopes. \"I was expecting to be challenged so I just jumped as high as I could,\" Owen said. The challenge from Mikael Silvestre was late and insufficient, allowing the diminutive forward to rise above the strapping French defender and nod the ball home, to his own evident surprise. There had been no surprise at all half an hour into the first half, when Owen sprinted down the inside-left channel and fastened on to a ball coming across from the right. What he did next could form the content of an entire chapter in any book on the arts of the great goalscorers. He touched the ball once with his right foot, redirecting it on a path towards the near post. As he ran into the area he seemed to be leaning further to the left, as if planning to shoot low into the left-hand corner. Instead he suddenly opened up his stance, angled his right foot and hit a perfect shot into the far top corner. Struck early in the stride, as Romario would have done, the shot left the goalkeeper without a prayer. From a seat in the directors' box, Sven-Goran Eriksson had an ideal view. It was a quintessential Michael Owen goal, the pinnacle of a performance that won him the man-of-the-match award. He was \"a little fatigued\" in his third game after return from injury, according to Thompson, but will be fit to report for England duty this week. Refusing to lay the blame for the defeat on individual errors, Sir Alex Ferguson instead criticised his team's lack of appetite. He made a sharp comparison between United's apparent complacency and Liverpool's willingness at all times to go and hunt for the ball. Nowhere was that appetite more evident than in Danny Murphy, who would have received the man-of-the-match award had it been in Thompson's gift. \"They had Butt and Veron knocking it about in the middle, and sometimes he had to chase both of them,\" the acting manager said of one of the less heralded members of the Anfield squad. \"Technically he's probably our best midfield player, and that's saying a lot. You can talk to him about something and he'll take it in, which is not true of all footballers. I thought he was the pick of the bunch today.\" Thompson had spoken to G\u00e9rard Houllier before the match, and had been instructed to tell the players to expect their opponents to retain possession of the ball for long periods. \"They might have more of the ball, but it's what you do with it that counts,\" Thompson said. \"They've got a lot of exceptional players and they keep the ball extremely well. But we know what their strengths are and we try to counter them.\" Liverpool's positional play would make the difference, Houllier had said, and it did. \"This is a reward for the guy who has pointed us in the right direction,\" Thompson added, having just come off the phone from his delighted boss, who will have been cheered by the sight of the Kop holding up cards forming a vast tricolour with his initials in their centre. But it was a reward, too, for the caretaker, whose run in charge stretches to six unbeaten matches and who has done everything that could have been expected to maintain the club's momentum. One of Houllier's most widely questioned appointments may just turn out to have been his best. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
