One person, reportedly the pilot, was killed. In a tweet around 2pm on a day of rain and low cloud that obscured the tops of many tall buildings in the city, the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) said: \u201cFDNY members are operating on scene at 787 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, helicopter crash landing.\u201d The New York police department subsequently said the incident was a \u201chard landing on the roof\u201d of the building. \u201cFire has been extinguished,\u201d an NYPD tweet said, adding that people should avoid the area of West 51st Street and 7th Avenue. The FDNY said work was continuing \u201cin response to fuel leaking from the helicopter\u201d and said: \u201cThere is currently one fatality reported.\u201d A White House statement said Donald Trump had \u201cbeen briefed on the helicopter crash in Manhattan and continues to monitor the situation\u201d. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was \u201cgathering information\u201d on the crash. The building at 787 Seventh Avenue, close to Broadway theaters and Times Square, is the 54-storey Axa Equitable Center. It opened in 1986 to much comment about its extensive displays of corporate art. As the New York Times reported, such displays included \u201cmurals by Thomas Hart Benton displayed in the lobby; large-scale wall commissions by such well-known contemporaries as Roy Lichtenstein and Sol LeWitt and massive sculptures by Barry Flanagan and Scott Burton.\u201d On Monday police, cordoned off the blocks around the building, barring access to reporters. A police official told the Guardian that although the fire from the crash had been contained, authorities were continuing to clear more of the area because of concerns about falling debris. Wanda Tucker, who works at legal firm on the 21st floor of the building, was there when the helicopter hit. \u201cI was just coming upstairs from lunch,\u201d she said, \u201cand a coworker asked me if I felt the building shake. Then they just told us that we have an emergency situation and that we had to evacuate the building.\u201d Talking to reporters, New York governor Andrew Cuomo referred to common anxieties around initial reports of such incidents, as when a small plane flew into a tall building on the Upper East Side in 2006. \u201cIf you are a New Yorker,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have a level of PTSD from 9/11. And I remember that morning all too well. So as soon as you hear an aircraft hit a building, I think my mind goes where every New Yorker\u2019s mind goes.\u201d Tucker said \u201csomeone got word\u201d what happened while she was in the building stairwell. Asked what went through her head, she said: \u201c9/11.\u201d She said: \u201cI know a lot of people where having anxiety. Once you get stuck you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d On getting out of the building, Tucker said, she called her family and then her boss, to let them know she was safe. Helicopter crashes are not unknown in and around the steepling buildings of midtown and lower Manhattan. Last year, five people died when a sightseeing flight crashed into the East River, in which three people died in a crash in 2011. In 2009, not far from the scene of Monday\u2019s crash, nine people were killed when a sightseeing helicopter collided with a small plane. On Monday, outside the exclusion zone imposed around the skyscraper, on 53rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) worker called Michael, who declined to give his surname, said that though he did not see the crash, he \u201cheard a helicopter going by\u201d. He said: \u201cI figured they were headed to the heliport on 34th Street. I said, \u2018It\u2019s flying too low. It sounded like a freight train.\u201d Then there was silence. \u201cI thought he was trying to make an emergency landing,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
