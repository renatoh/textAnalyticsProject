Late offers of help flooded in unexpectedly, and came after initially low expectations over the fund-raising conference's likely success. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, speaking at the start of the event, told delegates from 77 countries that they were there to \"make a strategic investment in hope\". However, by the time the conference had reached its halfway point, countries and international lenders had pledged only $19bn in grants and loans, on top of the $20bn promised by Washington. Today's total still falls well short of the $56bn that the UN and World Bank say is required to rebuild the war-ravaged country over the next four years. Much of the money comes in the form of loans and credits, which will weigh further on heavily-indebted Iraq. The president of the Iraqi governing council, Ayad Allawi, opened today's pledging session with promises that his country would not forget those who had helped it in its hour of need. \"Your success here will be a success for humanity and a help for peace and security in the world,\" he said. The Japanese foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, tabled today's biggest pledge, offering $1.5bn in grants for 2004 and $3.5bn in loans for 2005-2007. Saudi Arabia pledged $1bn, but the richest country in the Arab world said half of that would be in the form of loans throughout 2007, with the rest coming in export credits. Saudi Prince Saud Al-Faisal said his country was also \"ready\" to reduce some of the $24bn it is owed by Iraq, but did not offer specific details. Mouwaffek al-Rubaie, a member of Iraq's US-appointed governing council, called the move \"a step in the right direction\". Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq - leading to the 1991 Gulf war - offered $0.5bn in new money, on top of the $1bn it has already spent. Iran, which fought Iraq from 1980-88 in a war that claimed 1 million lives, said it would let Iraq export oil through Iranian ports, as well as supplying its neighbour with electricity and gas. Italy today pledged $232m over three years, in addition to the 3,000 troops it has stationed in Iraq. In all, the EU is giving $812m next year. That is less than the $931m it offered to Afghanistan last year, and reflects the absence of France and Germany. The two leading opponents of the US-led war are holding back to register their disapproval of the US blueprint for restoring Iraqi sovereignty. However, Germany's deputy minister for economic cooperation, Erich Stather, said that Berlin could offer export credits and would play a \"constructive role ... in finding a solution of Iraq's debts\". In an interview published in European newspapers today, Mr Powell expressed regret that Paris and Berlin were not pledging new funds, but said it would \"not mean it's a disaster\" if the two-day conference did not raise all the money needed. The IMF estimates that Iraq owes around $120bn, mainly to European and Gulf countries, as well as reparations from the 1991 Gulf war. Its director, Horst K\u00f6hler, said the fund could lend Iraq as much as $4.25bn over three years - the IMF's first-ever loan to the oil-rich nation. However, Mr K\u00f6hler stressed that Iraq needs economic stability and reforms, as well as debt relief, to encourage private investment and lower its 60% unemployment rate. \"These results will not come overnight. We know that these reforms will only succeed if there is ownership by the Iraqi people,\" he said, referring to Washington's continued control of the country. The World Bank has said that it will lend Iraq $3- $5bn over the next five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
