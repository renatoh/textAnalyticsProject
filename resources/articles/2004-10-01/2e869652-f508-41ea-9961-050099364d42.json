But amid the sardonic asides about his Manchester United colleagues and the banter that has flowed since Wales and England were drawn in the same group, he had a couple of serious messages. One was for himself, the other for England. Responding to a question about his international career and what would leave him satisfied at the end of it, he replied: \"Qualifying for a major championship is the only way to look at it as a success. If we didn't qualify it'll probably be seen as a failure.\" Failure is not a word that trips off Giggs's tongue. Manchester United have been as good to him as he has been to them. Silverware has been plentiful. But with Wales it has been a different story. It is 13 years since he ran on in a Wales shirt for the first time. It came in Nuremberg against Germany and he replaced Eric Young of all people. Giggs was 44 days short of his 18th birthday. There have been another 47 caps won since then, meaning that next Wednesday's against Poland will be his 50th. Giggs reflected quietly on the highlights of that injury- and United-interrupted career and chose that late debut in Germany - \"it felt longer than three minutes\" - and his full debut 18 months later when he scored the first in a 2-0 win over Belgium. Ian Rush got the other. \"Some of the games at the Millennium Stadium have been memorable,\" he said. \"The Italy game.\" The Italy game was the 2-1 victory this month two years ago that seriously suggested that Wales could reach Euro 2004. \"We set a benchmark - it's keeping to it. You have to be realistic about the size of Wales, but when you have performances like the one against Italy you know you can do it.\" Wales have not scaled the same heights since. They missed Euro 2004 by losing in a play-off to Russia that left Giggs suspended for the first two matches of this campaign. By means of an explanation, though, he said the starting XI that night against Italy has not played together since. They will not do so again on Saturday - Robbie Savage is suspended - but the other 10 are available and likely to start. Perhaps this is why Giggs was relatively bullish about Wales's chances, even if Cardiff bookmakers make them 7-1 outsiders. This was the message he had for England. \"England are favourites, no doubt about that. But we know we are capable of getting the right result. If we play to the potential we showed a year, 18 months ago, we can cause any team problems. We know we have the players to hurt them.\" He added that England have plenty of the same. But few will be as motivated as the 30-year-old winger. \"For Wales there is no bigger game. It's a great occasion for all the lads to be involved in but even more so for myself because it's at Old Trafford and because I am up against so many of my team-mates.\" Gary Neville is likely to be in front of him, David Beckham behind. There is also Rio Ferdinand, and Giggs mentioned Nicky Butt - \"who I am close to\". As for the new kid on the block at United, the boy being compared to Giggs as he was as the 1990s began, Giggs offered: \"I think I've said enough about Wayne Rooney.\" Saturday, he hopes, will be all about Ryan Giggs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
