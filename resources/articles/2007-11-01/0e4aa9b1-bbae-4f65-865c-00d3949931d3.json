The judgment against Irving in his libel case against Deborah Lipstadt in 2000 set out proof that it was precisely Irving's self-appointed role as Nazi propagandist that led to the systematic distortion of history and rendered his version of the past utterly unreliable. All the Oxford Union has done is give Irving more publicity and assisted his phoney campaign to become a martyr to free speech. For, apart from defending the reputation of a totalitarian regime and its murderous F\u00fchrer, Irving has himself tried to suppress criticism of his views. That was the purpose of his self-destructive libel case against Lipstadt. A few weeks ago he threatened the Jewish Chronicle with legal action if it described him as a Holocaust denier. Thanks to the internet there is no need for prestige institutions like the Oxford Union to give platforms for hate-mongers to prove that free speech is alive and well. As for the \"nuggets\" of history unearthed by Irving, which Hastings so values, they are turned into false gold by the sludge of toxic lies in which he buries them. David Cesarani Royal Holloway, University of London I went along to have a look at the protest at the Oxford Union on Monday and, as well-meaning as the braying crowd of self-conscious adolescent radicals were, they'd got hold of the wrong end of the stick. Behind all their whingeing placards was the unmistakable implication that fascists shouldn't be allowed to say what they think in public. But offensive and outrageous opinions are precisely the ones that society must value and protect most because they're the most controversial and thought-provoking. The protesters are trying to establish a precedent for censorship that could be used to shut them up tomorrow, and also making the fascists look like the persecuted underdogs. James Aber Regent's Park College, Oxford As a member of the Oxford Union, I am dismayed by the frequently inaccurate portrayal of the society in the national media. I often hear it described as a distinguished debating society with a proud intellectual history. Yet the union is simply a social club for self-important egoists who are prepared to go to any lengths - even entertaining fascists - to win publicity and advance their political careers. I joined the union under the misconception that it was a serious debating society and I am appalled that my membership fees are being used to provide a platform for racists. I applaud Tory MP Julian Lewis - who spoke of the \"naive vanity\" of these \"ambitious young wannabes\" - and urge the media to stop dignifying these overgrown schoolchildren with the attention they so desperately and selfishly crave. Liam Taylor Balliol College, Oxford Martin McClusky, president of Oxford University student union, says the protest against the Oxford Union is because the chosen speakers are \"not qualified\" to speak about free speech. So, just who is qualified? Would it be the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, now hiding in India because her views \"gave offence\"; or perhaps the British teacher Gillian Gibbons, facing the possibility of 40 lashes in Sudan, for allowing her pupils to call a teddy bear Muhammad; or perhaps the thousands of clerics in churches, synagogues and mosques in Britain who have full support of the law to purvey dogmatic, superstitious and threatening nonsence as facts, without ever fearing that an angry mob of students will gather to protest outside their door? In reality, of course, \"free speech\" is exactly what is says on the tin: the freedom of anyone to speak about anything. Whether we listen is up to us. Tony Bayliss Chiang Mai, Thailand While I in no way condone the repellent fascism and bigotry of Nick Griffin and David Irving, they are entitled to voice their obnoxious bile according to Islam's transcendent text. The Qur'an makes it incontrovertible that all people have the right to choose their own path and perspectives in life (2:256; 10:99; 18:29; 109:6;etc). It is therefore a fallacy that Islam denies the vital principle of freedom of speech. Our progressive Oxford organisation has always endorsed the concept of undiluted free speech. Either there is free speech for everyone or there is free speech for no one. Today abhorrent rightwing racists are targeted. Who will be proscribed tomorrow? Dr Taj Hargey Chairman, Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford The sense from the Oxford Union president is that there is no cost to this event, only the benefits of defeating racists in open debate. The impact may not be felt by him but it will by the minority students in Oxford. Jewish students told me they were afraid to leave their residences; is any \"debate\" worth the price of intimidating students out of their right to walk freely through the streets? Yair Zivan Campaigns director, Union of Jewish Students Why in this country is everybody running scared of giving voice to Nick Griffin et al. Is there any need to protect those oh-so-well-educated students from the virus of BNP propaganda? Turn to France and see how they handle the far right there. I watched Ripostes on France 5 on Sunday when Jean-Marie Le Pen was cross-questioned for over an hour. At the end of the discussion there was a sense that it was all over for him. It is only by full exposure that extremism and racism lose any force they may have. Phil Jones Eastington, Gloucestershire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
