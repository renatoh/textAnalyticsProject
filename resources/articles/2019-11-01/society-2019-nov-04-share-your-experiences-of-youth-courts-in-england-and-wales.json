We want to hear from you if you have been through the system or have worked with those who have. Share your experiences If you have been through the system as a child we would like to hear from you. How did you feel at the time and how has the experience affected you since? If you work as a lawyer, judge, magistrate, social worker, or in a youth offending team, we would also like to hear about your experiences. You can share your stories by responding to the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your contributions and we will include some of your responses in our reporting. If you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here.
