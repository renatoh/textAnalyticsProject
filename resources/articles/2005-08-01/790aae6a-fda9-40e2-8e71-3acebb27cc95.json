To do so they had overcome an innings of abandon from Ricky Ponting, who might have been run out before he scored but then batted sublimely for 61, and one of immense courage and character from Justin Langer, who took Australia into the final session before succumbing to Simon Jones. There was a typical flourish from Adam Gilchrist, too, as the innings was in its death throes but he had to battle for his unbeaten 49. However, with Australia dismissed for 308 - not a single six in that total and just 39 fours - England were able to embark on their second innings with a lead of 99, and the knowledge that the pitch, dried out increasingly not so much by sun but by a buffeting crosswind that sucked the moisture from the ground, was already holding up for Ashley Giles. There is genius abroad, however. In the evening sunlight, Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss had added 25 against the new ball with some panache when Ponting summoned Shane Warne to the City End for what might be the last over. His second ball, to Strauss, projected from round the wicket to the left-hander, turned prodigiously from out of the rough and, as the batsman padded up, spun across and behind him and pegged back his leg stump. It was an omen to take into today, the most emphatic of punctuation marks. Warne, with the bit between his teeth, is the most potent weapon in the match. Australia still have to bat last but this match is by no means England's. England had bowled well as a unit, a significant factor in their success of recent times. There were no wickets this time around for Steve Harmison but he made himself felt with the new ball and created his own brand of self-doubt. But Matthew Hoggard removed Matthew Hayden with his first ball of the match - the first time in Tests that the opener has succumbed for a golden duck - Jones produced a decisive spell late in the afternoon when he mixed reverse and orthodox swing cleverly, and Andy Flintoff nipped out Simon Katich and then finished off the innings clinically with a brace of fast reverse-swung yorkers that Waqar Younis in his prime could not have bettered. Yet no sight will have been more pleas ing for England or the Edgbaston supporters than that of Giles twirling away from over the wicket and creating problems for all the Australians who faced him. He finished with the wickets of Ponting, Michael Clarke and Warne at a cost of 76, lending Michael Vaughan the kind of control from one end that has been such a factor for England, and, perhaps, going some way towards earning the respect that the Australians have appeared so reluctant to concede. As England left the pitch, Giles's colleagues moved aside to allow him to lead them into the pavilion, recognising as they did not just his statistical contribution but how much it meant to him. The King of Spain knows this ground and its quirks well enough, but this was a test of character after the press ding-dong of the past week. There was a vote of confidence of a sort in the picture of him on the front cover of the match programme and he could carry into the match the memory of his nine-wicket performance here last year. Still, he was a man with something to prove and he did so immaculately, using the breeze cleverly, varying his pace and creating trouble for left-handers from the rough outside their off-stump. This time around Vaughan allowed him proper fields too, protecting him on the boundary while giving him predatory close fielders: sometimes two, more often three. What confidence can he now take into the second innings where he knows that, whatever Warne achieves, it is within his compass to win the match for his side. Australia might have expected better from their batsmen on a pitch that still showed no demons but this is an upper order that has been creaking for nine months now, bailed out time and again by the enterprise and skill of Gilchrist. Yesterday's start, though, was beyond England's expectation. The third ball of the day, from Harmison, who had hit Langer on the elbow in the opening over of the first Test, rose from short of a length and sounded the back of the opener's helmet like a gong. Langer reeled away, dazed momentarily, with England players making a display of inquiring after his health. Last week Langer confided that he has not been on the receiving end of such a roughing-up as he got at Lord's since his debut against West Indies. Now he knows there is more to come before he returns home. Hoggard took the second over, the field for Hayden set to a plan, with Vaughan at short mid-off, and Strauss at short extra cover in addition to his slips and gully. His first ball, on a length, was driven firmly by Hayden but in the air straight to Strauss. Immediately Ponting, in attempting to get off the mark, was within a whisker of being run out, Kevin Pietersen's throw careering for overthrows instead. While Langer dug in to play the sort of gritty, head-down innings that would have had Geoffrey Boycott purring his admiration, the Australia captain embarked on an elegant cameo containing a dozen boundaries, set, it seemed, on the definitive innings that the match still demands. But by lunch he had gone, top-edging as he swept Giles, and with him, right on the stroke of the interval, was Damien Martyn, run out inspirationally by Vaughan as he tried to sneak a run to mid-on. By tea, two more wickets - Clarke, edging Giles to Geraint Jones, and Katich, also nicking to Jones, the bowler having changed the angle from around the wicket to over for the left-hander. At 219 for five, England knew they needed one more wicket to prise open the door to the tail. The breakthrough came from Jones, an inspiration at times, who had begun to gain some swing as the ball scuffed. Reverse swing demands time in the air and his full length to Langer pitched just in line with the leg stump and would probably have hit the same. Over 4 hours Langer's dedication had earned a century, and not even a fellow of Gilchrist's capability could resurrect his side this time. \u00b7 Yesterday in the Ashes Shot of the day Fair play to Justin Langer and co, but few would argue that Marcus Trescothick made the grandest statement with the willow, hammering Brett Lee through extra-cover off the first ball of the second innings. Ball of the day Trust Shane Warne to poop an English party, but he completely befuddled Andrew Strauss, bowling the left-hander behind his legs from around the wicket with a ball that turned almost at right-angles. Boiling point It didn't take long. Just two balls, in fact. A nasty, rising Steve Harmison bouncer slammed into the back Langer's helmet in the first over of the day. Still, it came as no surpirse that Langer carried on: he has a black gi in the martial art of zen do kai. Biggest surprise The sight of the former prime minister John Major throwing an inflatable shark to a group of drunken spectators. Apparently the fans, who had spent a large portion of the day slapping each other with said sharks, grew restless and pelted one at the former PM. Surely not, umpire? It's bad enough that Rudi Koertzen seemed to get it wrong when adjudging Jason Gillespie lbw off Andrew Flintoff. It's worse, still, that the veteran umpire took a full calendar year to raise his finger. Man of the day Muy bueno, se\u00f1or Giles . The King of Spain, back to his regal best, claimed 3-78. He was all matador yesterday - mesmerising the Australians with his flight and, finally, killing the young bull Michael Clarke with a quicker arm ball. Ol\u00e9 . Stat of the day It's been 22 Tests since England topped Australia on first innings. And to dial random Australian numbers to remind them of this fact, the international code is +61.
