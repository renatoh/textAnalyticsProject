That's one way of looking at things. Another way is that the drivers' union Aslef have ignored a previous agreement and are a bunch of greedy opportunists motivated by a desire to make Boris Johnson look inept. The first definition is, of course, the union's and the other is that of Conservative London Assembly Members and other Boris supporters. Whichever version you prefer, there's going to be a strike: London Underground plans to run services on all lines that were scheduled to operate (the Metropolitan was already going to be closed for engineering works), but says each will be \"limited\" or \"reduced\". An interesting question for football fans and shoppers to contemplate on Boxing Day as they try to make their way to matches or the West End is whether industrial action on the Underground, whichever union is involved, would be less frequent if Ken Livingstone were still London's Mayor. It is significant, if unsurprising, that vocal London Tories are eagerly suggesting that Ken, his running mate Val Shawcross AM and the Tube unions are all in it together, deliberately causing as much trouble as possible and making out that it's all Boris's fault. Hammersmith and Fulham Councillor Harry Phibbs goes beyond insinuation: Next year, every time we suffer at the hands of the unions \u2013 let's remember who is really behind the misery we as Londoners are having inflicted upon us. And why. The collusion theory proceeds from the fact that Aslef and the TSSA - one of the two unions involved in the separate, ongoing, dispute over platform staff reductions and ticket office closures - funded and backed Livingstone's successful campaign to become Labour's candidate for the 2012 election. Now Phibbs has published a photo of Shawcross at a picket by the RMT, the TSSA's ally in the staffing levels strikes. Attention has been drawn to Livingstone's not expressing disapproval of the Boxing Day strike or any of those that happened through the autumn. Nudge, nudge, wink wink, Red Ken is the striker's friend. But this doesn't stack up half as neatly as Livingstone's enemies would have you think. He's certainly close to Aslef and the TSSA but his relations with the RMT, notably in the person of Bob Crow, have been decidedly ratty in the past. I seriously doubt that any of the three unions' leaders put the interests of the Livingstone campaign at the top of their priority lists when formulating policy, and it seems even more unlikely that their members do when balloted about industrial action (Aslef's voted in favour of the Boxing Day strike by a massive nine to one). The reality is that the unions know they'd get a more sympathetic hearing - or at least a more empathetic one - from London Underground and TfL under a Livingstone mayoralty than they presently do under Johnson's, and the two that don't dislike him have thrown their weight behind him accordingly. Big surprise. Boris's mayoral campaign will doubtless be funded by individuals from London's financial sector for equivalent reasons, just as it was in 2008. Big surprise again. If London's voters want to see fewer strikes on the Underground in future, they should pay less attention to Ken Livingstone's relationship with Tube unions now and more to the possible benefits of it should he be returned to City Hall. Would there be fewer Tube strikes under a Ken mayoralty or a Boris one post-2012? Ask yourself that on Boxing Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
