Normally there\u2019s a peak in calls after school, but everyone is at home so there are loads of young people coming through all the time. There is also a lot more risk than we\u2019re used to \u2013 it\u2019s not just friendship issues, it\u2019s problems with much more complexity. Kids are stuck at home with families where there\u2019s already problems. Some used to go for walks to get away from it and now they can\u2019t, or kids have had their counselling sessions cancelled or moved to phone calls. For those with really severe problems, like suicidal thoughts, hospitals are less safe because of coronavirus, so some parents are having to watch them 24 hours a day. We\u2019ve had to close the service between midnight and 9am because of the lack of [staff] resources. Our management team have been great, they really want to keep the service going, but there are so many volunteers who can\u2019t come in because they\u2019re ill or high risk. I\u2019m part time, but I\u2019ve already done overtime, nights and weekends. I\u2019m doing three late shifts a week at the moment to cover shifts, when normally I do maximum one or two. The police officer, Yorkshire We get assaulted a lot, but there\u2019s a new wave of people threatening to cough on us or saying they\u2019ve got Covid-19 and using it as a way to threaten the officers. The vast majority of people are following the guidance, but for some, having police officers tell them they can\u2019t do something makes them challenge it, because it\u2019s so different to how things normally are. We\u2019re stuck in the middle, because we haven\u2019t put these restrictions in place, we just have to enforce them. There are quite a lot of staff in self-isolation, and all non-essential training has been cancelled, but at the moment staffing is relatively normal. If we\u2019re going to an address where we know there\u2019s symptoms, or someone is self-isolating, then we wear personal protective equipment, but we have a shortage like everywhere else. In custody, we don\u2019t have the facilities to space people out any more than we would normally do. If they present symptoms, we can wear face masks whilst interviewing them, though. In a way, I\u2019m quite glad I\u2019m still working, because I think I\u2019d be going stir crazy in the house. Normally, when we work on the weekend, a lot of our involvement is in people going out drinking, but if you drive through the city centre now, it\u2019s empty. It\u2019s like a parallel universe. The bus driver, south-east England I\u2019ve lost a lot of hours because of the reduction to the service, so my income has dropped significantly. Despite this, I\u2019m still expected to go out and drive buses with people coughing and sneezing. When I pick up my bus, I do all our usual checks, and then I sit in the driver\u2019s seat and go over every single part that I might touch with my antiviral wipes, then gel by hands, and then I can set off. For many of my elderly passengers, taking the bus to go shopping is the only way they can get out. There\u2019s one old boy who says that the moment he sits in a chair at home, he won\u2019t get back out. Most of them aren\u2019t online either, so they can\u2019t order anything for delivery. I\u2019m worried about giving something to them. The authorities don\u2019t want to run empty buses because it won\u2019t be profitable, so they have to limit the number. But that means people are waiting for ages and all pile on, which reduces the space they have. There\u2019s no social distancing there, but I can\u2019t go round and clean the bus every time I stop. It\u2019s quite frightening, really. My partner has a heart condition, and I don\u2019t want to think about the possibility of giving it to him. I don\u2019t want to be the reason my husband dies. It\u2019s a horrible situation, but my husband can\u2019t work, so I\u2019m the only breadwinner. If I don\u2019t earn money, we don\u2019t have any. The care home manager, Scotland At the moment, we\u2019re lucky enough that no one has symptoms. It\u2019s a strange atmosphere but it\u2019s still quite positive. There aren\u2019t many residents who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on; even those with dementia understand that things are different because of a global phenomenon. They\u2019re all going along with it really well, and if they start to feel lonely, we set up a private video chat with their family. We\u2019re placing a lot of trust in the staff, like when they get home they\u2019re staying indoors, but they\u2019re worried too, and very dedicated. They take their temperatures in the morning when they arrive, sanitise their hands, and bring a change of clothes to work in. We\u2019ve set up WhatsApp and Facebook groups to keep in touch with families while they can\u2019t visit. We take photos and videos throughout the day so they can see that our residents are still doing things. This is something no one could ever have imagined, but we have dealt with diarrhoea and vomiting outbreaks and had to isolate residents. The biggest difference is the uncertainty. The government don\u2019t seem to have a clue, so we\u2019re just doing what we believe is the best way to do things. Getting food has been difficult for staff. We had a member of staff turned away from Tesco at the healthcare workers\u2019 hour \u2013 they were told they weren\u2019t a real nurse because they didn\u2019t work for the NHS. I made ID badges and laminated them for the staff, but again they said we couldn\u2019t go at the NHS time. Even when you can get in, the shelves are empty. The postal worker, southern England I\u2019m still delivering junk mail and that seems mad at the moment when post office workers are going off sick \u2013 one piece of junk mail for pizza showed a picture of people in a park together. Online shopping has led to a huge swell in the number of packets we\u2019re delivering. It\u2019s like Christmas. Social distancing means new rules \u2013 no more than one person to a post van. The other postie, who would normally be doing the walker\u2019s side of our route, is now expected to walk out to the drop-off point or catch a bus. The two-metre rule is almost impossible to enforce when we\u2019re working in the office, and people are very worried about that. One of the extra key services I\u2019m providing is conversation. There\u2019s one older woman who lives by herself and wishes it could all be over for her birthday in a week\u2019s time. She\u2019s asked to me to swear I won\u2019t stop delivering to her, whether I get the virus or not. The supermarket worker, Cumbria The first huge panic took us by surprise \u2013 we had no restrictions in place. A lot of our customers are regular people who we\u2019ve known for years, but there were lots of new people who didn\u2019t know how things worked or where they were. They wouldn\u2019t use self-checkouts because of the germs, so there were long queues. There was a lot of anger directed towards us, and it was panic-stricken. We\u2019re only letting in about 40 people at a time, and there are queues outside in the early mornings. The car parks are normally full with about 150 cars, but there are about 15 there now. During the initial lockdown, the car park was deserted, and a large rabbit came up to the staff door everyday. We never normally see wildlife, but it was so quiet that the rabbits were coming out to play. What\u2019s most strange is that people just don\u2019t talk in the store \u2013 they nod and smile and whisper. The delivery driver, Somerset It\u2019s worse than it is at Christmas. I would normally do about 10 or 12 drops each day, 14 at a push, but yesterday I did 20. I\u2019m still dropping off orders of \u00a3400. Sometimes people shop for multiple families because they can\u2019t get delivery slots. Nowadays, we have no complaints about replacing items with alternatives, people understand, and that\u2019s very different to usual. Our policy was to carry shopping in if needed, but now we aren\u2019t allowed in anyone\u2019s house, we just leave them at the door in bags and step back. We won\u2019t collect the bags either, which has caused a massive explosion in plastic. It\u2019s a very stressful time, and I\u2019m definitely concerned about bringing [the virus] back. We don\u2019t get gloves or face masks, just gel. None of the people packing the vans wear gloves, and we share vans which run from 6am to 11pm, so you don\u2019t know who\u2019s touched what. I was working on the night of the national NHS clap, and people came to their gates while I was driving down the road and cheered, saying, \u201cWell done, driver,\u201d and things like that. That was great. The cemetery worker, London This week has been really draining for me. I have been present at eight funerals and five of them were coronavirus-related. I\u2019ve been a gravedigger for five years, I work in one of the smaller London cemeteries; there\u2019s a nice community vibe here. Doing what I do, I\u2019ve been really aware of the seriousness of the outbreak, but I think it took the public longer to become aware of it. Even after the lockdown was announced, people were still playing football and frisbee in the cemetery. At one burial there were about 30 people standing closely together and they all hugged each other afterwards. I was thinking I could end up burying some of them. I do worry about what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s incredibly stressful. Workers here are concerned about catching something because the virus lives on surfaces. It can be on a coffin, or anywhere, you just don\u2019t know. We do have enough PPE at the moment, but it won\u2019t be easy for a family to see us in hazmat suits during a funeral. Death is such a taboo subject, but we have to be more open as a society about talking about it, particularly now. We just don\u2019t know where we\u2019re heading. The atmosphere is very tense.
