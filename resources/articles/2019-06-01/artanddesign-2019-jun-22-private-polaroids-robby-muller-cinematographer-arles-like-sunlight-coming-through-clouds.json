On weekends, when he wasn\u2019t completely immersed in his day job, Robby M\u00fcller would pull out a SX-70, a 600, a Spectra, or whatever model of Polaroid camera he was using at the time, and start capturing the everyday details he saw around him. Often it would be an interior shot of his hotel room: he\u2019d notice light seeping through a pair of green shutters, or his own reflection multiplied to infinity in the bathroom mirrors, and take a picture. Or it could be a street scene: a deserted car park in Memphis or the neon-lit exterior of a Santa Fe bar. Pulling the print out of the camera, M\u00fcller would write the date and location on the back and tuck it under his T-shirt for safe-keeping. Later, he stored the Polaroids \u2013 around 2,000 of them, taken over three decades \u2013 in a wooden box at home in Amsterdam. The day job, for M\u00fcller, was as director of photography on some of the most strikingly composed films of the late 20th century. His closest working relationship was with Wim Wenders; he shot 12 of the German director\u2019s features including Alice in the Cities, The American Friend and Paris, Texas. He also worked with Jim Jarmusch on Down By Law, Mystery Train and Dead Man, and Lars von Trier on Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. On these films, as well as others by William Friedkin, Peter Bogdanovich, Sally Potter and Michael Winterbottom, the Dutchman built his reputation as a fearless experimenter who preferred to shoot spontaneously, riffing on whatever caught his eye in the moment rather than constructing shots in advance. He used natural light, eschewing cumbersome lighting rigs where possible, and the resulting images \u2013 of lurid LA drinking dens in Barfly, or of Johnny Depp paddling down a monochrome river in Dead Man \u2013 seem to glow from within. After M\u00fcller died in Amsterdam last July aged 78, following several years of illness, Jim Jarmusch told the New York Times: \u201cHe was inspired by painters who used light the way Caravaggio and Vermeer did. I used to tease him that he should have been born in the same century as Vermeer.\u201d M\u00fcller had a knack for finding beauty in the most unpromising places. To understand how he achieved this over more than 70 feature films, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his off-duty camerawork. \u201cHe was always taking photographs,\u201d says his wife, Andrea M\u00fcller-Schirmer, a Dutch art magazine photo editor who has curated an exhibition of M\u00fcller\u2019s Polaroids which opens to coincide with the annual photography festival at Arles next month. \u201cHe never left the house without a camera, he always had at least three or four in one bag.\u201d Polaroid cameras appealed to him because \u201cthey had this instant result,\u201d says M\u00fcller-Schirmer. He would take a photograph, study the printed image a moment later, \u201cand then take another one to improve what he saw.\u201dSometimes he took multiple Polaroids of the same situation; in one wonderful sequence, shot at the Mayflower hotel in Manhattan in 1986, sheer curtains billow in a breeze. At first the light from outside dominates, but over the course of six photographs the windows darken and the light from a bedside lamp takes over. It\u2019s easy to imagine M\u00fcller filing this lesson away for a future piece of understated, but masterful, cinematography. From the sense of loneliness that haunts the Polaroids, and his keen eye for the tawdrier side of American life, it\u2019s no surprise that M\u00fcller was an admirer of the painter Edward Hopper. But according to M\u00fcller-Schirmer, who met her future husband on the set of Wim Wenders\u2019s Until the End of the World in 1990, the scarcity of people in his frames also reflected his character. \u201cI think he was too shy to approach people and ask them [if he could take their photograph],\u201d she says. The Polaroids have the feel of an intimate sketchbook, a way of working things out in private, and according to M\u00fcller-Schirmer they weren\u2019t intended for public consumption. But a decade ago, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen, who hired M\u00fcller to shoot his 2002 video installation, Carib\u2019s Leap, and remained friends with the couple in Amsterdam, took one look at the collection and said, \u201cOh, these are so beautiful, you really have to do something with them.\u201d In 2016, as part of a celebration of M\u00fcller\u2019s work at EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, a small selection of the Polaroids went on display, accompanied by two small photo books entitled Interior and Exterior. The forthcoming exhibition at Arles will feature a larger selection of the Polaroids, including first sight of M\u00fcller\u2019s nature photography \u2013 among them the glorious images of trees that had caught McQueen\u2019s eye. Preparing for both exhibitions, M\u00fcller-Schirmer went through the many thousands of images her husband captured before he was incapacitated by vascular dementia, which robbed him of his speech. They reminded her how thoroughly his job saturated his waking hours \u2013 \u201cFor Robby there was no division between life and work,\u201d she says \u2013 and they also helped her to see the world around her with fresh eyes. Selecting just 100 or so Polaroids to go on show at Arles was no mean feat. \u201cWhen I start to look back through them,\u201d says M\u00fcller-Schirmer, \u201cI always see new ones and think, Oh this is also very beautiful\u2026\u201d She pauses to take a breath. \u201cSome of these images are also really magical.\u201d Robby M\u00fcller: Like Sunlight Coming Through the Clouds is presented by Polaroid at the Place de la R\u00e9publique 12, Arles, France, 1-28 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
