Trent Alexander-Arnold escaped a handball inside his penalty area 22 seconds before Fabinho\u2019s stunning goal sent Liverpool on their way to a hugely significant victory which leaves them eight points clear at the top. The City manager made his feelings clear to the fourth official Mike Dean, and again when a second penalty claim against the Liverpool defender was rightly dismissed in the second half. He also exchanged words with the match referee Michael Oliver after the final whistle \u2013 appearing to sarcastically say \u201cthank you so much\u201d \u2013 but denied saying anything untoward. Afterwards Guardiola, who has been on the receiving end of several VAR controversies, insisted it was Riley\u2019s responsibility as general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited to explain the varying interpretations of the handball rule. The City manager said: \u201cAsk Mike Riley and the big bosses about that. Don\u2019t ask me. Ask Mike Riley and his people. I\u2019m here to talk about the game. Every time I\u2019m being asked why one day it\u2019s handball, the next day it\u2019s not. Don\u2019t ask me. Ask them. I know the way we were champions last two seasons, I\u2019m so proud of that. \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable because it looks like Pep is complaining but congratulations to Liverpool, 3-1, could we have done differently on the second, third one \u2013 is it a penalty, isn\u2019t it a penalty? I don\u2019t know what with all these ifs, you don\u2019t know what will happen in the future. Ask the big bosses. \u201cTomorrow I go to the Uefa meeting and we discuss these things. What can I say? It\u2019s not nice for this club. We have started to be in the elite in the last 10 years, not like Liverpool, you\u2019ll never walk alone, who have been there 30 years, 40 years, 50 or 60 years. We are new to that. The organisation will help us to grow, these experiences will help. These games are part of life, sometimes for us and sometimes against. The referee and these kind of decisions, ask the big bosses, they know more than me.\u201d However, the City midfielder Ilkay G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cI saw the incident again in the dressing room afterwards and for me, obviously, it\u2019s a penalty, but if you ask a Liverpool player they would say: \u2018You can give it but it\u2019s maybe a 50-50 situation.\u2019\u201d The Premier League has a different threshold for handball than Uefa. Under the explanations given by the Premier League in August, Alexander\u2011Arnold could have been penalised for making his body \u201cunnaturally bigger\u201d but not for a handball that followed a ricochet off a nearby player. PGMOL clarified: \u201cThe VAR checked the penalty appeal for handball against Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold and confirmed the on-field decision that it did not meet the considerations for a deliberate handball.\u201d Defeat, City\u2019s third of the Premier League campaign, leaves the reigning champions fourth in the table and with a major task of catching J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s unbeaten leaders. Guardiola said his team\u2019s performance \u201cshowed why we are champions\u201d and left him feeling prouder than ever at Anfield, but Liverpool ruthlessly exploited City\u2019s defensive vulnerabilities as they recorded a 46th league game unbeaten at home. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the penalty incident in the first half before Fabinho scored so I can\u2019t say anything about, but I\u2019ve heard it was first handball by Bernardo Silva. I don\u2019t know. I can imagine it\u2019s not a situation Pep is really pleased with. That\u2019s normal. But the reaction we showed, 22 seconds later we were in front of their goal and Fabinho with his stunner brings us the 1-0 lead. \u201cThe second goal we scored, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a goal like this. A right full-back with a 60-yard pass to the left full-back, two touches and then a cross over 40 or 50 yards and a header. All around these three goals it was the hardest work. The boys deserved these three points.\u201d Klopp insisted Liverpool have given no thought to remaining unbeaten all season and are feeling no pressure as they enjoy a commanding position in their pursuit of the club\u2019s first title for 30 years. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any pressure. If you are with us then nine points is a positive. Other people will 100% say that from now on Liverpool can only lose it. That\u2019s a very negative approach, but you can see it like this. But we don\u2019t care. \u201cNine points ahead of City, you cannot imagine that something like this would happen. But it\u2019s not important because who wants to be first in November? You want to be first in May. The pressure is not there yet. It will come, but at the moment it\u2019s just opportunity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
