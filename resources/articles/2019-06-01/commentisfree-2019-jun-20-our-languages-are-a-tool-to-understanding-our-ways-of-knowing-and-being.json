I was named after my paternal grandfather Mohamed Ali Drummond, who belonged to the Wuthathi people of Cape York, and my maternal great-great grandfather Jimmy Wailu, who belonged to the Dauareb people of the Murray Islands. I am a Meriam and Dauareb (Murray Islands) traditional owner and a member of the Wuthathi Aboriginal Corporation. My family lines expand beyond this but those that need to know my connections know. As a nurse academic, I am privileged to teach the next generation of nurses. Most undergraduate health professional education now requires students to undertake education in Indigenous health. Balancing the expectations of health professional groups and universities is complex work. Navigating this as an Indigenous man while trying to learn how to better privilege Indigenous peoples\u2019 knowledges and perspectives is challenging. This yarn is about how reconnecting with Torres Strait Islander languages, knowledges and community. The lessons I learnt about belonging and relationality have stayed with me and continue to evolve my practices. Like many yarns, this starts with something I saw on Facebook. I saw a promotion for Mabuiag language classes in Brisbane. Mabuiag is a dialect of Kalaw Lagau Ya, the Western Islander language group of the Torres Strait Islands. I was surprised by the access to learn a Torres Strait Islander language in Brisbane, and I was curious about how the opportunity came about and what I could learn if I participated. Driving down Montague Road towards a small industrial building for my first language class, I was getting increasingly nervous. I had spent all day switching between teaching activities and working on my PhD, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to prepare for my language class. I hadn\u2019t done any readings or listened to any podcasts nor had I spoken to my mother or father, my go-tos for proper cultural matters. Who was going to be there? Will I be related to them? If so, how? What are the proper protocols? Relationality or how we relate to one another is imperative and protocols refer to how we negotiate relationships in dynamic contexts. I didn\u2019t want to make mistakes and then have my mistakes determine my worthiness of the language. I was also not sure if I would be accepted, because while I had family connections to Mabuiag through marriage, this was not a language that I identified with growing up. My nervousness was at its peak as I walked towards the class. Then, upon seeing the familiar face of Aunty Mattie, the nerves started to dissipated. Aunty Mattie and her husband Uncle Brian were our generous language teachers. Aunty Mattie pulled me aside to recite our family connectedness and we yarned about family. These lessons were not promoted on the Facebook page of course. The warm embrace (actual hugs and welcoming engagement) was a familiar feeling; like visiting family. It was not just about feeling welcomed but about belonging. Relationality was a pivotal pedagogical or teaching principle. This wasn\u2019t just limited to our relationship with each other and other Torres Strait Islanders, but also our relationship to our home \u2013 the land, the sea, the sky and the cosmos. Uncle Brian taught us the basics, including the Ephraim phonetic orthography (alphabet), words, pronunciations and sentence structures. The relationality to our home was pivotal to the teaching. Learning about words required us to gain an appreciation of the seasons and their relationships to the weather, stars, and the life cycles of the animals and plants. It was like learning about these entities all over again, from a position that privileged our knowing and being. We learned about the origins of words, as you would a word based on Latin or Greek, only their origins were here. This provided insight into the founding ontology (being) and epistemology (thinking). Poetic and lyrical, our languages are not just a reflection of the English translation of one reality but more insight into our ways of being and knowing within multiple realities. At the end of our second semester, we were taught songs. Although short, these songs were layered with meaning. One particular song was associated with a story that took 30 minutes to tell. Within these songs and stories were the lessons about day-to-day activities and philosophy. If learning single words was like learning about the stars in the sky again, then learning through songs and stories was like connecting the stars and realising full constellations. I have learnt so little of Mabuiag language \u2013 this would take years of dedicated learning. However I have a more profound understanding about the imperative of harnessing language as a tool to understanding and privileging our ways of knowing and being. The United Nations has declared 2019 the year of Indigenous languages. Language is not a neutral form of expression that centres English as normal. To translate from and to. Language makes accessible our ontologies and epistemologies because our languages in turn are realised by them. We must remember and reconnect, not just through speaking our languages, but through reconnecting with our ways of knowing and being. \u2022 Ali Drummond, a Meriam and Wuthathi man who grew up on Torres Strait, is a PhD candidate, a nursing lecturer and a director of Indigenous health at QUT.
