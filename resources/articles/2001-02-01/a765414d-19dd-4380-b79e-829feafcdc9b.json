It's to stop all you poor frozen people back in England from being jealous of me - at least for a week. You see, this week has been my first real week at the hotel and I've found that they are more than happy to give us travellers a lot of work. In fact, if we wanted, we could be there practically 24/7. But as I've said before, work is a reality for a lot of young travellers - though I've mentally promised myself that the moment I begin to feel stressed, or that my enjoyment of my travels is being dampened, I'll stop. That's the wonderful thing about my year out and I'm still enjoying every minute of it. Thursday, the day after my evening of karaoke stardom, was a very long day. At 5.30am I was at the bus-stop having had three hours of sleep, just wondering how I was going to stay vertical until the end of the day. Fortunately, I had one of the easiest jobs of all - looking after a conference group. Basically, for nine hours I waited for them to leave the room, at which point I would leap behind a table and pour coffee. Not particularly taxing on my brain (which was lucky), and the added bonus was that I got several good feeds. In fact, I'm getting very spoilt - I'm so used to eating five-star food that it's going to be a shock when I return to the endless pasta meals I used to cook for myself! On Friday, as if the day before hadn't been early enough, I had to start work at 6am. When I left my apartment it was still pitch black and several people were on their way home. The crazy thing, though, was that my bus was absolutely packed - far more so than in the afternoons! At least I got to see the varieties of people who were around Circular Quay (home of the Bridge and the Opera House) at that time of day. There were several men wielding large fishing rods, a couple of people huddled under blankets or coats sleeping on benches, and a large group sat around still drinking outside a 24-hour cafe, of which Sydney has plenty. I was overjoyed that my day's work was over and done by 10am, leaving me some free time. In the afternoon I met up with Sam, one of the other Netjetters. It was a gorgeous, hot afternoon, so a couple of drinks in a bar on Darling Harbour seemed like the best place to go to catch up. I found it quite strange to meet Sam after following him via the website whenever I got a chance. As he says in his report, we found a lot of our reactions to situations had been similar. It was nice to sit and have a beer and a chat with another traveller - and we both had many stories to tell. He also made me even more excited about my coming trip to New Zealand as he seemed to have had such a fantastic time. That Saturday morning I went to a big travel expo to try and sort out my flight and was surprised to learn that only two airlines fly to Christchurch - the man helping me said it was a pain to get people there. So, no success yet, but I'm determined. On Saturday night I was meant to be watching rugby, until we discovered it was on a week later than we thought. So I chose my other favourite hobby - back to work!! Honestly, I quite enjoy it. I can hardly believe I'm saying that but I'm actually enjoying doing some work. Besides, the people I work with are lovely, which helps. That night I got off at 1am and had to be back in at 7am, Sunday. Myself and two other working travellers were all in the same boat and said we may as well have slept there - still, I'm getting good at working on three hours sleep so it didn't seem that bad. Despite the temptation to stay on all Sunday night and work at a hairdressers' banquet, I thought it would be better to not kill myself from overwork so instead went home and had Thai take-away from Chicken Out. I can't believe how cheap food is here - for $6, I had a meal that was so enormous I couldn't even finish it. That's less than three pounds (although I'm trying to avoid converting prices back as I travel). On Monday morning I was in for breakfast, which I can't imagine will hold your interest enough for me to describe it. That afternoon I went to see the woman who sorts the rota and asked her if she could give me some more shifts, which she did there and then. This assertiveness I learnt off Adil, a French working traveller, and I've found that it will get you amazingly far. I just need to develop his knack for getting all the easiest jobs now. So, that evening I was the host for the hotel's resteraunt. This may sound quite classy, but basically I am the girl who smiles at the door and walks you to your table. It was a fantastically easy job, with most of my night spent fielding desperate calls from men who'd not yet booked anywhere for Valentine's Day. The highlights of the evening were another worker calling me across the hall to point out Ronnie Corbett at reception, and being able to correctly answer the question \"where's the capital of Australia?\" On Tuesday morning I booked my flight to New Zealand!!!!! I hope that conveys how excited I am about it - massively. As the day was hot and I was feeling sun deprived, I headed to the beach for a short while. Brian tried to tempt me into the water again but I refused. I know I'll get back in again soon, but it's just a case of when I have the confidence. That night I resumed my position of host at work, only this time I think I counted close to a million calls about Valentine's Day, to which I replied: \"Well, sir, maybe you should have thought about it before 10pm the night before and have appreciated that your partner is within the same hemisphere as you, because we have been fully booked for days and I am getting really annoyed by all your calls.\" Well, maybe not my exact words, but the sentiment was there. Wednesday was Valentine's Day. I hope everybody reading had a lovely day or night or both. In the evening Brian and I made some popcorn and watched a video, and I tried to ignore the significance of the day totally. I guess when you travel alone there are meaningful dates (Christmas springs to mind) when it would be nice to see some of the people from back home. Still, there are many other dates (nearly every day springs to mind) when I think I wouldn't change what I'm doing for anything... Until next week (more long days, short nights, and the prospect of seeing some familiar faces) Milly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
