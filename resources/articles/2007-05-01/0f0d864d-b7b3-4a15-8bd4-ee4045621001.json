But many observers were convinced that Spinks's superior boxing skills had been enough to get the verdict against Taylor. The 29-year-old former world champion was sure he had won and said afterwards: \"It was highway robbery. I executed my game plan and I thought I won.\" However, Taylor said: \"He ran the whole time and I couldn't punch. You can't take a championship running.\" There is speculation that Taylor may now choose to step up to super-middleweight to fight Joe Calzaghe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
