In 2016 she wrote, directed and starred in Prevenge, and last year appeared in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. Next she stars alongside Bill Nighy and Sam Riley in Sometimes Always Never, a film written by Frank Cottrell Boyce about a Scrabble-loving family coping with a loss, to be released in cinemas on 14 June. What attracted you to the project? Frank Cottrell Boyce is on my list of people I\u2019d say yes to, even if he asked me to play a paper bag. And when I found out Bill Nighy was involved, I was over the moon. It\u2019s a really warm comedy, without being soppy or cheesy \u2013 it\u2019s wry and witty, with lots of surprising humour. Like Prevenge, it seems to be about one thing (demonic possession, Scrabble) but actually deals with loss and grief. Is there something in the British psyche that struggles with articulating these things more directly? Definitely. It\u2019s about families not saying what they mean to each other, all that miscommunication. That\u2019s quite a British thing \u2013 everybody knows something\u2019s the case, but it\u2019s just never spoken about. And there\u2019s all this repression. The one positive is that it\u2019s often really funny. For me, Prevenge was an explosion, a primal scream about stuff we don\u2019t talk about, that we keep concealed and civilised. Sometimes Always Never, in a very gentle way, is really cathartic as well. It\u2019s about a family letting those emotions go and being healthier for it. What was Bill Nighy like to work with? Amazing. I was slightly scared \u2013 just before we went to do a rehearsal, he gave this interview where he said he hated it when actors didn\u2019t learn their lines. I use a lot of improvisation, so I was terrified he was going to hate me. Then I turned up and Sam [Riley] was telling exactly the same story about this interview. But Bill could not have been lovelier on set. He\u2019s a consummate entertainer: he has all these amazing stories, where you sit all day and listen to the people he\u2019s met, the stuff he\u2019s done with his life. And Sam and I both really, really learned our lines. What did you find most satisfying about creating Prevenge? A sense of freedom. I was just like: \u201cAh, I get to do stuff the way I want, and everybody has to listen to me, because I\u2019m the director.\u201d I can\u2019t wait to direct again, which I\u2019m doing this summer: a film called Timestalker, which I\u2019ve been working on for a couple of years. It\u2019s a fantasy, in a way, about reincarnation. It\u2019s going to be funny, but with bits of horror and melancholy. Presumably, now that Prevenge has done well, it gives you more freedom? I think so. My dream is to be allowed to do my thing \u2013 it\u2019s this idea of an auteur. I don\u2019t know how many women get called auteurs, but I like the idea of it. It\u2019s a really pretentious word, which is partly why I like it, but it also means you get to do what you want. What\u2019s the most challenging part of directing? Probably my fear that I might offend other actors by telling them what to do. The way I get around that is by just trusting them to do whatever they want. It will be different directing with a toddler as well: before, she was in my tummy, which makes her a lot easier to keep your eye on. Luckily, the company, Western Edge Pictures, who also did Prevenge, are so supportive of me being a mum \u2013 that is vital. Is there a widening understanding of this in the industry? Definitely \u2013 there was a creche for the first time in Cannes this year, and I support Raising Films, a charity all about parents and carers working in the film industry. Being a film-maker shouldn\u2019t mean you have to be completely antisocial and never see your family \u2013 it\u2019s not very self-sustaining. Why do you think it\u2019s taken so long to have women on screen \u2013 in things like Prevenge, Killing Eve, Fleabag \u2013 who behave badly but are still likable and three-dimensional? It\u2019s changed so much. Some of the reason I started writing was my frustration, as an actress, at the lack of diverse roles for women \u2013 they\u2019d be really one-dimensional and boring. But there\u2019s this whole wave coming through, which is really exciting. We pitched Sightseers as a TV idea a few years ago and no-one wanted it; they were like, \u201cYou can\u2019t have violence and comedy in the same show.\u201d That would seem ridiculous now \u2013 that\u2019s changed in just seven, eight years. What do you think the future holds for choose-your-own-adventure type narratives, like Bandersnatch? I think there\u2019ll always be a place for conventional film, because there are always going to be people who want to know what the exact narrative is. It\u2019s like this weird thing with Game of Thrones, people going: \u201cWe want a different ending.\u201d But sometimes the best ending isn\u2019t an ending you want. You might not want the lead character to die, for example, but that\u2019s still the best ending of the film. It\u2019s interesting that people feel like they have the power to choose. When you\u2019re writing, do you second-guess what the audience would want? I do, actually. I come from live performance, so I really relish giving the audience a reaction, a visceral feeling. That\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to comedy and horror \u2013 there\u2019s a reaction there. Phoebe Waller-Bridge [creator of Fleabag and Killing Eve] said something really interesting: that it\u2019s fine to scare people or shock them, but it\u2019s criminal to bore them \u2013 that\u2019s how I feel. What do most people in the street recognise you for? Hot Fuzz, bizarrely, because I think it\u2019s shown on ITV so often. But I don\u2019t get recognised generally. When you talk to taxi drivers or something, they go: \u201cWhat have you been in?\u201d So I list what I\u2019ve been in, and they\u2019re are like: \u201cNah, nah, nah.\u201d If someone does recognise me, it\u2019s actually quite nice, because I know they\u2019re a fan of really obscure comedy. Then I\u2019m like, OK, you\u2019re a nerd like me, nice to meet you. How has comedy changed since you first started out? There are a lot more women around, which is brilliant, I remember going to Edinburgh 20 years ago and feeling like I was the only woman there. And I think comedy has become less fantastical: there\u2019s less surrealism, which personally I quite miss. Things always go one way and then back again. So I think there\u2019s room for a return to more craziness in comedy, more weirdness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
