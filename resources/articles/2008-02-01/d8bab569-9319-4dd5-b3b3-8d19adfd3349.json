Last week Fulham chairman Mohamed Fayed was outlining his conspiracy theories, and he had more grist for his mill during a London derby that was as dull as it was bleak. The desperately mediocre contest was decided by substitute Nolberto Solano's elbow, an intervention that Howard Webb failed to spot, and one that meant Fulham's grim run of having only won once since 4 November continued. 'When you are down the bottom, it does go against you somewhat,' said West Ham manager Alan Curbishley. 'It was a tight game.' 'There's been a foul and the goal should have been disallowed,' said Roy Hodgson. 'He went in with two feet up in the goalkeeper's face. We have to keep going. The performance was reasonably satisfying. It was an even game but I don't think we deserved to lose it.' Before the game began, there was a minute's applause for Bobby Moore on the eve of the 15th anniversary of his death. The players wore black armbands. West Ham, their fans in fine voice, dominated from the start with Carlton Cole to the fore. Three times he was denied as he showed his strength and athleticism. It was frantic stuff with the ball zipping back and forth at great pace but to little effect. Luis Boa Morte had the best chance, the ball falling to him four yards out with his back to goal, but his header lacked power and direction. Fulham huffed and puffed but produced nothing. Paul Konchesky had a weak shot saved by Robert Green early in the half, and a weaker one from Brian McBride came in towards the end of the half. Their fans' desperation was evident in the incidents that would bring them to their feet. A non-penalty, a non-foul, a non-throw. There were conspiracies everywhere and referee Webb, as far as the home fans were concerned, was at the heart of them. The second half continued in the same vein. A Diomansy Kamara shot hit Anton Ferdinand in the area - 'Penalty!' they screamed. A Bullard shot was diverted - 'Penalty!' they screamed again. West Ham came back, Mark Noble pushing a shot just wide and a fine ball from him found Cole, who was stopped by a good tackle from Aaron Hughes. The game opened up. A Kamara pass released the clunky Clint Dempsey but one-on-one with the keeper he shot tamely at Green. At the other end, Boa Morte should have done better when given a free header on the six-yard line. Next, a very strong back-pass from Hughes very nearly confounded Antti Niemi. Fulham made a brave late effort. Leon Andreasen put Bullard through and Green had to save well. And then the contentious goal. Lucas Neill crossed, Boa Morte chested back and a sprawling Solano elbowed the ball past a flailing Niemi. A rubbish, probably illegal goal. Andreasen was sent off for banging on about its lack of aesthetic merit. 'If you don't protest things like that, it shows you have no interest in winning matches,' said Hodgson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
