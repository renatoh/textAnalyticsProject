The woman is thought to be from the north-east of the republic and left the country several years ago. The Irish Times reports that she is believed to be in her late 30s, and left the forces in 2011, having served in an infantry unit and the country\u2019s air corps. The Garda released a statement saying: \u201cAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is aware of an Irish woman who left Ireland three or four years ago having become radicalised. She was previously a member of the Irish Defence Forces.\u201d Her existence appears to have been revealed 10 days ago, when an ITV news crew visited a camp in northern Syria. While they interviewed people alleged to be foreign fighters and their families, the crew noticed that one woman spoke with an Irish accent. The woman told ITV: \u201cThe people don\u2019t have food. They\u2019re struggling for food and money and everything is expensive, so I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to keep living.\u201d A spokesman for Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cWhere possible, we will provide consular assistance, but we do not comment on individual cases.\u201d A source told the Irish Times that as the woman had not contacted the Irish government, she could not be offered consular assistance. They said: \u201cUntil we get a request for her for assistance, there is little we can do.\u201d A spokesman for the Ministry for Justice in Ireland said they were aware of the woman, but that \u201cit would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of security matters, or indeed on individual cases\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
