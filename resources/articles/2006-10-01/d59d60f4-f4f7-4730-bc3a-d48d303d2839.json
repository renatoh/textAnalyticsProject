He is just one of many students who have realised recruitment fairs can offer much more than a carrier bag full of pens and mousemats. \"I was quite secure in the knowledge I would become a translator before I went to the fair,\" says Smith. He was in his third year of a modern languages degree when he wandered up to a stall promoting careers in PR, \"just to see\". Smith now runs the successful Sonus PR agency in London, specialising in the telecoms market in the UK, Asia and North America. Smith says he wasn't even planning to go to the fair but a couple of friends talked him into it. \"At that time I didn't have a clear idea of what PR was, so I spent five minutes talking to the PR person and I was blown away. I found out about the fast pace of the work, the creativity and organisational skills required. It seemed like the perfect fit for my interests and skills.\" After his Damascus experience at the fair, Smith did some shadowing in the university's PR department and \"there was no going back\". Dan Hawes is co-founder of the Graduate Recruitment Bureau (GRB), which visits recruitment fairs across the UK every autumn and summer. He says if you don't know what you want to do with your life, \"after two hours at a fair you will be 80% clearer.\" He adds: \"You get a chance to get behind the website and meet people working at the company. This could be a previous graduate recruit or the recruitment decision-makers themselves. \"It's an excellent opportunity to leave a positive impression on a recruiter by being inquisitive, smart and keen on the day. Far more effective than a CV or speculative letter. Moreover, some recruiters only advertise at fairs so you may be surprised to discover companies you never thought hired graduates.\" Louise Polly, 24, from Bangor, Northern Ireland, graduated from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a first-class degree in marketing. She had registered with online recruitment agencies, was checking the papers and had visited the university careers service, but it was her university recruitment fair that landed her a job as a marketing executive at Nigel Wright Recruitment in Newcastle. \"I got the job when one of the employees I spoke to passed my CV on to the marketing and business development manager,\" she says. \"He then invited me in for an interview.\" Polly is pleased with the outcome: \"The beauty of working here is that I am exposed to a great deal of marketing activities, ranging from research to PR, which will equip me to transfer more easily in the workplace at a later stage.\" It was especially lucky for Polly as marketing is a notoriously difficult field to break into, \"especially in the north-east,\" she says. \"There is so much competition with three large universities in the region, offering good business degrees.\" Polly says her job search prior to the fair had been largely fruitless and she was almost at her wits' end. \"Many of the vacancies that appeared were located further south, mainly in London,\" she says. \"And the hardest part is getting to the interview stage. With so many other people applying it is difficult to ensure your CV is picked up and put at the top of the pile.\" She says this is why recruitment fairs are most definitely not a waste of time. But it's best to go prepared, she says. Make sure you've got your CV, have an idea of who's attending and, if you can, find out what roles they are likely to be advertising. Don't restrict yourself to your own university fairs, try to find out about fairs in places you would like to live, and make sure you arrive early to catch representatives at their most responsive. Moreover, don't just stroll up to desks asking, \"So what do you do?\". This is a question they will hear any number of times. Doing some research will help you stand out. As Polly points out, \"Dandering round and picking up leaflets is a waste of time, but stopping at the stalls, chatting to company representatives can help you decide what sort of company you really want to work for.\" Clare Price, graduate personnel manager for Tesco, says recruitment fairs are a great place for an employer to alert students to different career paths. \"They are such a useful tool for graduates to find out about the programmes we offer.\" And, as Smith says: \"You owe it to yourself to explore the opportunities that could lead you into a really satisfying career.\" \u00b7 The Autumn Graduate Fair takes place at Old Billingsgate, London on October 25. Exhibitors include Reuters, the Royal Navy and IBM. www.egrex.co.uk for details"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
