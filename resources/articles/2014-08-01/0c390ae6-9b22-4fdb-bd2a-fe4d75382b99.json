The prime minister will make the comments in a letter to Nato in the wake of Russia's role in arming Ukrainian rebels suspected of shooting down the MH17 airliner and deteriorating relations with President Vladimir Putin. He will also call for a review of Nato's relationship with Russia, saying Putin now views the organisations as an adversary and not a partner. In a show of military strength, the UK said it would send 1,300 troops and 350 armoured vehicles to take part in a Nato exercise in Poland in October to help reassure eastern European countries that they have western allies. However, earlier this week, the House of Commons defence committee warned Nato is ill-prepared to confront new threats posed by Russia, and members of the western military alliance may not have the collective political will to take concerted action to deter an attack. The US and EU have already imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia this week that are the most severe since the end of the cold war. On Wednesday, G7 leaders said they were prepared to \"further intensify the costs\" to Russia if it does not change its policy of supporting separatists in the Ukraine. With six weeks to go before the Nato summit in Wales, the prime minister wrote to leaders from the alliance's member states and the secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, warning that security threats across the globe are multiplying. \"In 2014, the world is more unpredictable than ever and we meet at another pivotal moment in the history of the alliance,\" he will say. \"In Afghanistan, our combat mission is coming to an end. To the east, Russia has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal annexation of Crimea and aggressive destabilisation of Ukraine. To the south, an arc of instability spreads from north Africa and the Sahel, to Syria, Iraq and the wider Middle East.\" Cameron's letter comes in advance of his visit to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (Shape) in Belgium on Monday. \"Six months into the Russia-Ukraine crisis we must agree on long-term measures to strengthen our ability to respond quickly to any threat, to reassure those allies who fear for their own country's security and to deter any Russian aggression,\" he writes. He lists specific actions he would like to see: a new exercise schedule adapted to the new security environment; the necessary infrastructure; pre-positioning of equipment and supplies; and an enhanced Nato response force. \"This should be part of a broader action plan that enables us to respond more quickly to any threat against any member of the Alliance, including when we have little warning,\" he writes. \"We must also review our long-term relationship with Russia. While Nato has only ever sought to be a partner to Russia, not a threat, it is clear that Russia views Nato as an adversary. We must accept that the cooperation of recent years is not currently possible because of Russia's own illegal actions in Nato's neighbourhood and revisit the principles that guide our relationship with Russia.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
