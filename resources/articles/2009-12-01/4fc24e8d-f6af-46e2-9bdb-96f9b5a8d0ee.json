After seven successive draws, against the likes of Burnley, Fulham and Hull, along come back-to-back victories over Arsenal and Chelsea. Lift-off for the richest club in the world? It is still early days, the team still very much a work in progress, but this first league win since September has at least got them moving in the right direction again. Not so, Chelsea. Eliminated from the Carling Cup in midweek, they now find their lead at the top of the table down from five points to two after Manchester United's demolition of West Ham earlier in the day. Carlo Ancelotti had the good grace to shake Mark Hughes's hand at the final whistle, when he probably felt more like throttling Didier Drogba, who spurned a straightforward chance from six yards just before the end. The biggest crowd City have had at Eastlands were in raucous, celebratory mood as they left the stadium, but there were 40,000 hearts in mouths after 81 minutes, when Nedum Onuoha brought down Drogba inside the area and Frank Lampard stepped up to take the penalty. The England man is usually deadly from 12 yards, but this time he shot too straight and too close to Shay Given, who brought the house down with a save low, to his right. Justice was served by the result, which came courtesy of goals by the strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tevez. Ancelotti thought his team deserved a draw, but then, as someone once said, he would, wouldn't he? When pressed, he was honest enough to admit that City did \"a good job\" on the Chelsea midfield, pressuring them into making more mistakes than is their custom. The match had seemed destined to take an altogether different course when Chelsea took the lead in the eighth minute, with a daft goal of the sort that has restricted City to one clean sheet in their past 11 league games. Given saved a shot from Branislav Ivanovic, and kept out, but was unable to hold, the follow-up by Nicolas Anelka. The ball bounced out to Adebayor and went in off his back, for an embarrassing own goal. To their credit, City took this latest blow on the chin, regrouped and hit back hard. Gareth Barry had a shot from 20 yards deflected wide by Michael Essien and Adebayor saw a goalbound header cleared off the line by Ricardo Carvalho. The breakthrough that City's high-tempo, high-morale efforts warranted came after 37 minutes, when Petr Cech punched the ball only as far as Shaun Wright-Phillips, whose crisp drive hit Micah Richards and flew to Adebayor, who scored close in at the second attempt. Drogba was within inches of restoring Chelsea's lead just before half time, with a curling free-kick. City were full of vim and vigour in the second half. They have had a habit of throwing away promising positions, but this time Chelsea were worried. Drogba's demeanour is a barometer of his team's angst, and he was bleating in overdrive. Cech, under pressure from Adebayor, booted the ball nervily into touch and Carvalho was booked for a rash challenge that was the product of City's pressure. Wright\u2011Phillips got away from Ashley Cole for once to create a shooting chance for Adebayor, who was thwarted by Ivanovic's last-ditch clearance. Then after 56 minutes City were ahead. A free-kick from inside the D by Tevez went through Chelsea's defensive wall, leaving Cech unsighted and embarrassed as the ball flew past him. Cue celebratory songs of \"Fergie, Fergie sign him up\". Drogba, climbing above Kolo Tour\u00e9, headed wide at close range, fuelling the impression that it was not Chelsea's day. Ancelotti sent on Juliano Belletti and John Obi Mikel to rescue a point, but City were in no mood to oblige. Ivanovic headed over from six yards from a Deco corner. Suddenly, it was Chelsea who were wasting scoring opportunities. Drogba should have equalised at the death, but justice was served by the result. The richest club in the world have shown what they can do. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Danny Pugsley, BitterandBlue.blogspot.com This was a fantastic game of football. Both sides were very good today. The one-touch football on a greasy pitch was great. Mark Hughes went for an attacking line-up from the off. That is the reason why we got points today. In recent weeks, with all the draws, we have been hesitant and cautious, but today we were constantly pressurising. It was one the best team performances from City that I have seen in a long time. There have been grumblings about Hughes, but this result will have quelled that for the time being, but there is a minority who will never accept him.

We had a couple chances even before we scored, then we took our foot off the pedal thinking it was going to be like Arsenal. But City fought for everything. Every 50-50 tackle, they won. It was the worst performance from our midfield that I have seen. Cech was nervy and our full-backs were poor; it was one of Cole's worst games, and that starved the front two. I'm not superstitious but that kit has got to go. We have never won while wearing it. Having said all that I still think we'll win the league.
