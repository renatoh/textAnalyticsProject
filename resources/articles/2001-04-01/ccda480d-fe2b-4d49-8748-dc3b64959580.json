In some cases it may be at the root of real financial hardship. Relentless pleading by children for particular items is contributing to family debt problems, says Paul Millins, general manager of the National Debtline. 'Pester power is becoming one of the reasons that a household budget goes into the red. It is a particular issue for those on lower incomes because their children go to school and want the same clothes, games, computers and what-have-you as everyone else. The parents can't seem to say no to the request. So they fulfil them, even though they don't really have the means to do so.' But this pressure is not the preserve of the poor. Millins points out that even parents with higher incomes are putting costly kids' products on to their credit cards only to find, later on, that they can't always meet the repayments. Eileen Jones, founder of the charity PositiveParenting.org, says that regardless of class, 'the commercial focus on children has led some people into money troubles'. Rebecca Thomas, a trained social worker and mother of three, agrees. She takes a 'firm but fair' approach to her children, telling them 'very clearly' what they can and can't have and coming up with a compromise where appropriate. But she admits: 'It can still be very difficult to simply say, \"No, we can't afford that\". 'Children are no longer content with just teddies or dolls or footballs. Now they not only want more, they want more expensive things, and those things have got to be the \"right\" brand.' Psychologists and retailers agree that children's demands depend on several factors, not least their age. The accepted wisdom is that the older they get, the more expensive they become. Jamie, a 12-year-old from Wales, has a personal wish list of kit worth several hundreds of pounds. It includes a colour Game Boy, a DVD player, Play Station 2, all the Pok\u00e9mon cards, the James Bond Thunderball and tickets to see Liverpool play Manchester United. But haven't children always wanted particular things and done their best to get them? Is pester power really new? Yes, says the 18-month-old National Family and Parenting Institute, which claims that the pressure for purchase has become greater. It is perhaps no coincidence that a conference called Kids 2001 will be held next month aimed at companies keen to capitalise on what has become known as the 'playground market'. The value of this is impossible to estimate, according to Peter Lancaster, joint managing director of the youth market consultancy Teenzworld. 'It runs into billions and billions of pounds. It is astronomical.' And, he says, it's going to get bigger. Marketing professionals admit they have only recently started to milk its potential. Nic Jones, who has long worked with leading international children's brands, says: 'Five or 10 years ago if a company had a kids' product in their portfolio they wouldn't really take it seriously. Now they take it very, very seriously.' This summer, Jones will launch his own brand. Pesterpower.com will invite children aged between seven and 12 to fill out their own wish list, which will be sent off to their parents. This is one of several sites being launched directly at children's spending behaviour. As for teenagers, there is Teenfront.com, Worldpop.com, Gameplay.com and Mykindaplace.com - most featuring big name sponsorship. Shopping on these sites is becoming easier for young people with the introduction of payment systems that don't require a credit card. On Uksmart.co.uk, for example, visitors pay with a type of token available from Post Offices. They simply quote the number on the token and away they go. As the site's splash page declares: 'Age is no barrier'. But all this is about 'empowering children', not harassing parents, says Nic Jones. He insists that websites like his are 'a way of children expressing their identity and their own opinion. It gives them a voice.' Others may disagree, but to date it is not the web that is the main focus of parental ire, but TV advertisements. 'They are pernicious,' says Mike Jempson, director of the media ethics charity PressWise. 'Their message is, \"If you haven't got this product, you are abnormal\". This is designed to get kids to pressurise their peers and parents.' Not so, insists Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College, London. He analysed 20 international studies of children as consumers and has published a report called 'Children and Advertising: the allegations and the evidence'. In it he concludes that the cause of pester-power is not advertising but 'irresponsible parenting'. Furnham says what is needed to combat it is an 'authoritarian' approach, where rules are established, expectations are managed and decisions are explained, all with the child's point of view kept in mind. Mother of four Sue Jupp, aspires to this and claims to get it right most of the time. 'It is very easy to respond to a child's immediate request, especially when you know they want it so they can fit in with everyone else, but you just have to set boundaries,' she says. 'If there is something they are particularly keen on, they have to work towards it, doing extra jobs around the house to earn the extra money to pay for it.' Rebecca Thomas thinks that doing anything else sets a bad example, especially in households where money is tight. Thomas says: 'Kids need to learn the value of things. If they just get whatever they want whenever they want, even if it means mum and dad are going into debt to pay for it, then what are we teaching them about money management?' Some might ask what are the parents teaching themselves? So how do you fight pester power? Best-selling author Elizabeth Hartley Brewer offers these tips: \u0095 Give regular pocket money, and stick to the limit. This encourages children to learn a sense of value. \u0095 Show them how to collect their 'wants' over two or three weeks, so they can prioritise them. \u0095 Put the waiting back. It's amazing how the 'must have now' soon fades in urgency. \u0095 Ask for a contribution towards the cost of expensive items. \u0095 Wherever possible, buy online, so your children can't be seduced by displays. \u0095 When you go shopping, be very clear what it is for. This makes it easier to stay firm. \u0095 If you decide to buy something, don't do it to assuage guilt: love shouldn't be measured by price tags. \u0095 Don't be frightened to say no. Children can learn that family and real friends don't judge by possessions. It is who they are inside that matters.
