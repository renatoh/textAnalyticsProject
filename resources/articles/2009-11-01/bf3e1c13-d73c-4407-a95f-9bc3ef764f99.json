I was recording with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in West Berlin when the wall fell. When I came to the recording studio on Friday 10 November I discussed with the musicians, who were in a highly excitable state, what we could do to mark the event. We planned a free concert on the Sunday evening exclusively for the citizens of East Germany, of Beethoven's 7th, a purely practical decision because we'd been practising it for the recording. There were no tickets, they just had to show their GDR ID cards. People were queuing outside from 4am in a line that stretched around the building. For many it was the first time they'd been in the Philharmonie [concert hall] and in the west. After the concert I sat in my dressing room, and a woman came to the door accompanied by a young man, with a bouquet of flowers \u2026 she came up to me shaking and gave me the bouquet and thanked me profusely, saying the Berlin Wall had separated her from her son (the man with her) and that they had been reunited again just the evening before for the first time in almost three decades. I was moved to tears by her story and told the woman she could always reach me and I'd invite her to a concert. She never got in touch, but she's stayed in my head for the past 20 years. I do hope she attends our concert at the Brandenburg Gate, where we'll also be playing Beethoven's 7th, which I'll personally always associate with the fall of the wall.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
