Since the Prince of Wales's Stakes was granted Group 1 status two years ago, the royal blue colours have been carried to victory by Dubai Millennium and Fantastic Light. Grandera may not be in their league, at least not yet, but he can carry on the good work for Godolphin in today's high class contest, centrepiece of the second day at Royal Ascot. Trained by James Fanshawe last season, when he was an unlucky third in the French Derby and runner-up in both the Eclipse and Juddmonte Stakes, Grandera showed he had arrived on the big-race stage by beating Paolini and some top international horses in the Singapore Airlines Cup at Kranji last month. Initially inclined to run Noverre today, Godolphin made a significant switch to Grandera, whose recent work on the Newmarket gallops suggests he has continued to improve. This is certainly the acid test, with runners of the calibre of Nayef and Banks Hill in opposition. But on the evidence of his latest win Grandera represents value at around 6-1. At Kranji he beat Hawkeye three lengths farther than Nayef managed in last season's Champion Stakes, and Hawkeye was only a length and a half behind Banks Hill when the latter was no match for Godolphin runner Slickly at Longchamp last September. Banks Hill has been beaten on the three occasions she has taken on colts and was well below form when third to Best Of The Bests and Poussin on her reappearance at Longchamp. Although he has won in the mud, soft ground was put forward as the reason for Nayef's lacklustre third behind Rebelline and Bach at the Curragh last month. He could well bounce back, but it is also possible Nayef won a substandard Champion Stakes last October, beating Tobougg and Indian Creek, with Carnival Dancer fifth. Bach, one place behind Grandera (3.45) in the Eclipse Stakes, is fully exposed but looks sure to run his race. The one largely unknown quantity is Desert Deer, who went a long way to justifying his trainer's high opinion of him when winning a Class B race by nine lengths at Newmarket. He will find life a good deal tougher here, though. The 32-runner Royal Hunt Cup poses its usual problems for punters, not the least being the effect of the draw. Last year Surprise Encounter burst clear on the far side to beat Big Future, who led home the stand side runners. It should pay to be drawn near either rail and, from stall six, Island Light (4.20) can make a bold bid. Ridden for the first time by Kieren Fallon, Island Light has the scope to improve on what he has shown in just five starts to date. He was unlucky to be touched off by Duke Of Modena last time out at Sandown, where his rider appeared to mistake the winning post. Beauchamp Pilot has benefited from Fallon's strength during his winning run. But he is another who should be thereabouts from his low draw. In the battle for supremacy among the high numbers, Kelburne and Scotty's Future enter calculations. Few Royal Ascot races can be whittled down to two runners, but the opening Jersey Stakes really does seem to concern Redback and Millennium Dragon. Redback is the one with Classic form, but Millennium Dragon (2.30) is not far behind him judged on his all-the way success in a fast time at Newmarket and a 3lb pull in the weights can give Michael Jarvis's colt the edge. At first glance it might appear that Somerset trainer Bill Turner is tilting at windmills with Dusty Dazzler (3.05) in the Queen Mary Stakes, but from her rails draw this speedy filly can go close in the hands of Jamie Spencer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
