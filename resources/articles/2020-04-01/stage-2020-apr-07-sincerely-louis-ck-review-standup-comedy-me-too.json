Anybody else get in global amounts of trouble?\u201d It was only a matter of time before Louis CK, disgraced in 2017 when he admitted to masturbating in front of several female comedians, confirmed his comeback with a special. Sure enough last weekend, mid-lockdown and out of the blue, Sincerely Louis CK \u2013 recorded in Washington DC last year \u2013 was made available on his website. Like Aziz Ansari\u2019s corresponding show a year ago, this set is hard to watch through any lens other than that of CK\u2019s behaviour. And, of course, he addresses them, in a manner you may find less pious than Ansari\u2019s, or less penitent, depending on how reprehensible you considered CK (or how much you loved his work) in the first place. Judging by this set, CK doesn\u2019t think he did anything uniquely bad. Everyone has their sexual quirks, he argues, and now, he reports shamefaced, \u201ceveryone knows mine\u201d \u2013 from Barack Obama to the Italian kid pointing at him recently in an airport. Towards the end, he fronts up to the issue of consent, reminding his audience that he sought consent from the women involved, but acknowledging (indirectly, via jokes about a similarity between the sounds of female sexual pleasure and slaves singing \u201cNegro spirituals\u201d in the fields) that that may not have been enough. This not-quite apology \u2013 heavier on self-pity than concern for the women involved \u2013 won\u2019t be enough for those outraged by CK\u2019s behaviour. But it\u2019s all we\u2019re getting, and at least it\u2019s consistent with CK\u2019s unsentimental worldview, which sees us all as amoral screw-ups struggling to get from cradle to grave with some shreds of dignity intact. That is the keynote in a show with a handful of jokes to recall CK\u2019s once permanent residency on all those \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d lists, and more that recall his too cynical 2016 Edinburgh festival show. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s not hunting big game, comedically speaking. He opens with a section on God that includes an unsparing riff on his mother\u2019s recent death and cremation. God is summoned to Earth to clear things up with a five-minute press conference \u2013 which, coincidentally, gives sexual deviants a free pass but comes down hard on carnivores. (\u201cHow could you eat a perfectly fuckable pig?\u201d) That\u2019s far from the only routine in whose margins CK\u2019s harassment scandal lurks, just out of vision. Elsewhere, there\u2019s some straightforward baiting of liberal pieties, as with a routine about \u201cretarded people\u201d that feigns to strike a blow for social justice while savouring the phrase \u201cretarded people\u201d a little too much; a riff on whether CK wants to \u201cfuck kids\u201d or not; and another about a Japanese waitress with a funny accent. Sometimes, it\u2019s all a bit of a strain: \u201cI used to date a woman who was vegan. So I had to fuck her with my dick substitute.\u201d Oh dear. Perhaps, now the veil has slipped, CK can no longer be bothered pretending to the loftier ideals that used to offset his more cynical material. But then some of his cynical gags here (the one about visiting boutique gift shops, say) are wickedly good, and there\u2019s higher-minded material, too \u2013 on his grandfather\u2019s flight from Hungary to Mexico, or on his relief, aged 52, that he now has only a manageable length of time left to live. On this evidence, it looks as if that time will be spent performing standup, even if \u2013 because the context\u2019s changed and because that doesn\u2019t seem to be bringing out CK\u2019s best instincts \u2013 he may be doing so to smaller and less joyful audiences. \u2022 Available at louisck.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
