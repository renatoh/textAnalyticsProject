Then, his poignant story of love and loss was turned into a musical performed in the lowly environs of a pub. Now, Pendennis learns David Blunkett's wooing of Kimberley Quinn is to be made into a 90-minute satire for Channel 4. Love is such a cruel mistress. \u00b7 Tory MP Andrew Robathan delighted last week in asking during a Commons debate whether the government's attempts to encourage 'respect' was compatible with the Deputy Prime Minister 'thumping people in the street and swearing at and insulting people in the corridors of this House'? The latter part of Robathan's question referred to the response he always receives when he bumps into Prezza and wishes him good morning in an exaggeratedly polite manner. The DPM's reply varies between 'f*** off' or muttering something about 'boneheads'. \u00b7 The fame of ITV's new journalistic signing, Rageh 'Scud Stud' Omar, clearly precedes him. The ex-BBC man recently pitched up to his Sri Lanka hotel to start filming a documentary on the tsunami and was confronted with a huge sign which bore the greeting 'Welcome Rageh Omar and ITV'. Rageh, your book might not have done too well, but at least you're big in the Subcontinent. \u00b7 Pity Boris Johnson. The MP-cum-columnist-cum-editor-cum-motoring correspondent was taking a holiday on a Greek island recently when he bumped into some of this nation's electorate. Typically droll salutations, according to Boris's sensational new blog, included: 'Oi, Boris, long way from Henley', and: 'Don't you MPs do any work?' Forgive them, Boris for they know not what they do. \u00b7 Oh, the photo opportunity that was missed. Trinity College Dublin's Philosophical Society thought it had landed a coup last week after persuading pop chanteuse Beyonc\u00e9, right, to present Archbishop Desmond Tutu with his honorary patronage of the society. Scheduling issues, however, meant Beyonc\u00e9 had to pull out, although her spokesman confirmed she had been 'very grateful for the invitation'. \u00b7 No surprise to see the Daily Mail running an anti-Europe screed last week ('Why I, an ardent Europhile, toast the French and Dutch for rejecting the Brussels lie machine'), but some raised eyebrows that the identity of the Europhile recusant was none other than Private Eye deputy editor, Francis Wheen. Is this the same Francis Wheen who, a couple of years ago, led the motion in a public debate entitled 'The trouble with this country is the Daily Mail'. The same Francis Wheen who averred: 'The Mail has no sense of humour whatever, and is certainly not heart-warming: its purpose is to provoke constant fear and loathing with lurid stories about asylum seekers ravishing our daughters, wild health scares and doom-laden pieces about property prices.' Not forgetting diatribes against the European Union. \u00b7 Channel 4 director of programmes Kevin Lygo recently stressed his channel was about more than Big Brother . 'Sometimes, I think it's like heroin addiction, but it's only 40 minutes a day for the summer - for a period of 10 weeks or whatever.' A glance at the schedules, however, reveals in the first week of the new series, C4 showed more than 38 hours of Big Brother and related spin-off shows, averaging nearly five hours a day. Some addiction, Kev. \u00b7 To Charles Clarke's meet and greet with hacks last Wednesday night where the bearded chap held court having spent the day talking up his bill to combat binge drinking. Unfortunately, Clarke's words of wisdom were drowned out by the sound of thirsty hacks guzzling the buckets of free booze the Home Office had laid on. pendennis@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
