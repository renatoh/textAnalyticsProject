Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi was reported on Monday to be fighting with the Islamic State militia group in Syria and Iraq. Social media accounts linked to the group posted photographs on Wednesday that appear to show Bilardi preparing to attack an Iraqi army unit in the Anbar province west of Baghdad. The images have not been verified, but reports from Iraq have claimed that 10 people had been killed and up to 30 injured in a wave of up to 21 suicide attacks on Wednesday. An Islamic State-linked Twitter account lists Bilardi as one of the \u201cmartyrs\u201d from the attacks. Guardian Australia has found a now-deleted blog written under Bilardi\u2019s nom-de-guerre, Abu Abdullah al-Australi, which appears to provide a chilling insight into how a precocious young man became obsessed with political injustices and embraced violent extremism as the answer. The blog\u2019s veracity could not be confirmed, but references to the writer\u2019s age and origin in a non-Muslim family in Melbourne line up with reported accounts of the teenager\u2019s life. The blog includes claims that before fleeing to Syria, the writer drew up plans to launch \u201ca string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes\u201d. The attacks would culminate \u201cwith myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar\u201d, he wrote. He got as far as collecting materials for explosives and preparing to start building devices before stopping, fearing authorities would become suspicious, and instead focused on crossing the Syrian border. \u201cWith my martyrdom operation drawing closer, I want to tell you my story,\u201d he wrote in the 4,300-word manifesto in January. He detailed his conversion from a \u201cbeing an Atheist school student in affluent Melbourne to a soldier of the Khilafah preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam\u201d, beginning with the September 11 terrorist attacks when he was five years old. He wrote that during the subsequent occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 before he converted to Islam \u2013 he instinctively empathised with the insurgent groups. \u201cMy views almost six years ago would be considered by the Australian government as extreme and myself an Islamic extremist, although I was still an Atheist, a little confusing I know,\u201d he wrote. The war on terror seems to have shaken the young man\u2019s faith in democracy. \u201cThis was the turning point in my ideological development as it signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system Australia and the majority of the world was based upon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was also the moment I realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that it I would likely be killed in this struggle,\u201d he said, suggesting he had become radicalised even before converting to Islam around the beginning of the Syrian civil war four years ago. The blogger wrote that he was initially drawn to the al-Qaida linked group Jabhat al-Nusra and another Islamist militia, Ahrar al-Sham. Meanwhile he had determined \u201cto finally remove myself from this land\u201d. \u201cI continued my search for a contact, even at one point considering simply crossing the border alone without any assistance. Finally, I made contact with a brother online who promised to bring me across the border, it was a risky decision to trust someone online but I was desperate to leave and was confident the brother was genuine,\u201d he wrote. He does not reveal how he fled Australia undetected, but said that he entered Syria via the Turkish border into Jarablus, a town in the northern Aleppo province. According to the blog, the young man quickly signed up to commit a suicide attack but had a \u201cfailed operation\u201d in Baiji, Iraq. \u201cAfter I witnessed the mistakes made, I turned to fighting in the city before once again registering for a martyrdom operation, a decision that would bring me to the large yet modest city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province.\u201d Police said they had searched Bilardi\u2019s home after he was reported missing last year and found \u201cchemicals that could be used to construct an explosive device\u201d. A statement said: \u201cNo actual explosive device was located by police.\u201d His family alerted authorities after he fled for Syria in August and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the government began to track his movements. \u201cI can also confirm that I have been aware of Mr Bilardi\u2019s presence in Iraq and Syria for a number of months now,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIn October on the advice of our security agencies, I cancelled his Australian passport. This is a tragic story. If the reports are confirmed, Mr Bilardi will be yet another Australian who has been killed in this conflict on the side of a brutal terrorist organisation.\u201d The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, on Wednesday described the unconfirmed reports of Bilardi\u2019s death as \u201can absolutely horrific situation\u201d. \u201cIt shows the lure, the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters and it\u2019s very, very important that we do everything we can to try to safe guard our young people against the lure of this shocking, alien and extreme ideology,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
