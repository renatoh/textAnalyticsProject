I haven't been plagued by the curse of the cortex for a few years now - I used to be beige and morose for at least three days a month until I finally detoxed what I can only describe as my digestive system, clogged up with chicken fat and ration-book sugar since birth. \"You'll never eat another banana,\" commanded Ms Gibeau, the nutritionist, and I never have. Nor mushrooms or aubergines, though they do tend to slip unnoticed into things and seem fairly blameless. Salt was banned and sugar and tea and coffee and, of course, I've slipped back on some of these; but, on the whole, she cut down my attacks remarkably and it's like an anvil has been taken off my chest. This migraine struck on a two-show Saturday. I had merrily declined the celebratory chocolate cake and champagne which marked our 100th performance. I'm in remission for life and I know it. In fact, over dinner with some friends in a posh restaurant later that night, I told my host that I was virtually cured of migraine. I told him this while I was busy tucking in to festive roast goose - my first - and drinking a glass or two of white wine. Then, at 3.30 in the morning, I awoke with a screwdriver in my brain. Days later, I have a tongue the colour of Anaglypta and my understudy, Sioned Jones, is probably right now hunting out a pair of brown trousers, her passport and a ferry to Bruges. It's a combination of stress and food that hits the jackpot. I don't know if the sauce on the goose contained monosodium glutamate, but it tasted good enough to suggest that it did. But then I have murdered many a duck in pancakes with plum sauce when the pace of life was easy, and not had the slightest reaction. All I know is that, migraine wise, I know nothing and neither do most of the experts I have ever consulted. Tony Porter, the reflexologist who is used to saving my life, came over and saved it again. It is miraculous; to observe someone pressing a place on your foot which makes your stomach gurgle and start to work again after a three-day lay-off. Without him, every understudy I have ever had would, by now, be a major star. My daughter once told me that she always knew when I had a migraine coming because I wore green clothes and my voice changed. I have noticed that people's voices express their wellbeing. When I'm on the phone I can tell immediately if a friend is down or unwell because there is a deadness of tone which comes from trying to retain energy. This theory only breaks down when one is talking to people from Hull, whose dry tones tend to be as flat as the countryside in which they live, with or without an 'eadache. An accent coach once told me that a local accent will always mimic the lie of the land - hence the up-down lyricism of the Welsh and wide-open throat of the mid-west. Certain Scottish accents can be attained by covering the teeth with the upper lip in a puritanical way, and speaking through the nose happens when the indigenous folk want to lose the cosmopolitan fragrances of living in a port, as in Liverpool or New York. The only exception to this is Birmingham. Of course, nothing can explain a Birmingham accent ... except, perhaps, chaos theory. When exploring how far I could extend my vocal limits for the play that I am currently appearing in, I picked up a book from a shelf in my study called Unlocking Your Voice. I was given this volume years ago by its author, Esther Salamon, a voice teacher who lived in north London. My memory of visiting her house is that it seemed psychedelic. There were the most vibrant hues everywhere. Pinks and blues and golden yellows and a garden filled with enormous summer flowers, growing as if in a child's painting. Esther herself looked like an advert for a natural health magazine. She filled her skin to the very edges, with a glorious head of white, white hair and cornflower eyes. I must have been having throat problems during the run of the musical Wonderful Town, and she directed me to the bel canto way of opening the throat and adopting a \"welcoming\" stance. I had forgotten all of this until the day, almost 20 years later, when I found myself, once more, struggling with a raw throat and some ray of sunshine directed me back to her book, hibernating on a study shelf. Since then, I have had no trouble at all, even when singing every night like a fox attempting to compromise a Siamese cat. \"I'd really like to thank her for that chapter,\" I thought to myself a few weeks ago. \"I wonder if she is still living round the corner.\" I was thumbing through the local paper as I had this thought and, two thumbs later, I saw her obituary on the page before me. I had to shake my head in wonder. If she'd had one more tip to pass on before she went to her next psychedelic garden, I'm so grateful that it was me to whom she passed it. \u00b7 The most powerful democracy in the world, nailed to a post with deadly precision last week by the new Nobel Laureate, has shown, by its actions in San Francisco that it is preachin' but not practisin'. Murdering murderers after more than 20 years on death row is an uncivilised act, and one which negates all hope of rehabilitation for offenders. A spokesman, when asked if Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams hadn't redeemed his acts by the children's books he had written in prison rejecting gang culture, replied: \"Yeah, well, he had some help with those from a journalist, y'know.\" The saddest fact is that had Tookie admitted his guilt on national television, possibly weeping uncontrollably into Oprah's lap, he would have been forgiven and possibly given his own chat show. As it was, he kept his dignity to the end and governor Arnie kept his movie-star title, The Terminator - or should that be Conan the Barbarian? \u00b7 This week Maureen listened to a sneak preview of the Radio 4 play Incurable Romantics: \"It's by Perry Pontac and is about Keats, Shelley and Byron living in an old folks' home in Italy. Divine, almost sublime comedy.\" Maureen watched Coleen's Story on Five: \"This is a young woman who's going somewhere and will probably end up editor of Vogue.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
