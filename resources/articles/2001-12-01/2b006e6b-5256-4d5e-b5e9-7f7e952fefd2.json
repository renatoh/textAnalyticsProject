Since switching to cable-skiing (pulled by an overhead cable rather than boat) at the age of 15 she has won seven national titles and eight European titles, and in 2000, only two days after her 20th birthday, she won the world slalom title. Kate Allenby, Stephanie Cook, Georgina Harland and Sian Lewis Modern pentathlon - women's individual (Cook), team (Allenby, Cook, Lewis) and relay (Allenby, Cook, Harland) If the Olympic victory of Stephanie Cook, right, was the finest hour for Britain's pentathletes, the world championships at Millfield School in Somerset in July ran it close. In a rare show of dominance the host nation came away with all three women's titles. Cook, of course, was the star of the show, participating in relay and team victories before adding her first individual world title. Cook chose that moment to bow out. It was a blow, but she could hardly have left the sport in better heart. The 23-year-old Georgina Harland, who had beaten Cook in the British championships in April, powered through in the final stages of the run to take third place at Millfield; the Olympic bronze medallist Kate Allenby placed fifth; and Sian Lewis was 14th. Remarkably, had Cook's score not counted at all, Britain would still have won the team title. Kate Brown Clay pigeon shooting - English sporting The 22-year-old from Walton in Leicestershire took up the sport little more than four years ago but has twice been crowned world champion in the English sporting discipline. Her first title came at Findon, Sussex, last year. This spring she successfully defended her crown in San Antonio in Texas. Daniel Caines Athletics - indoor 400m Caines won his world title in Lisbon in March, squeezing home ahead of the American Milton Campbell. The 22-year-old Swansea graduate comes from an accomplished sporting family. His uncles Garry and Keith Thompson played for Aston Villa and Coventry respectively and his mother Blondelle was an international hurdler. Charlotte Cornwallis Real tennis Penny Lumley had dominated real tennis since she won her first title in 1989, losing only three games in 12 years. When the 28-year-old Cornwallis triumphed in Washington DC it was arguably the biggest shock ever in women's real tennis. James Cracknell, Matthew Pinsent and Neil Chugani Rowing - coxed pair and coxless pair When you have won three Olympic titles before your 30th birthday motivation can be a problem. So, for Matthew Pinsent the priority for this year was to find a goal that would challenge the rower generally recognised to be the strongest in world sweep rowing. The partnership with James Cracknell, right, also in the winning coxless four at Sydney, provided just that. Together, they mapped out a world championships schedule never previously successfully undertaken, that of winning both the final of the coxed pair and the coxless pair, the two events held within 90 minutes of each other at Lucerne. The first challenge had been Cracknell's, having to switch his oar to the bowside (left) of the boat meant a different pattern to the stroke. His adaptation was swift, as victory in the first World Cup win in Princeton confirmed. Two more World Cup victories secured the overall title and allowed them to opt out of the final. In the world championships at Lucerne, the coxed pair came first, Cracknell and Pinsent joined by the cox Neil Chugani. Their victory over the Italians was close but nothing like as close as what was to come. Less than two hours later, and coxless, they lined up for their second final. Pinsent, by his own admission, only ever does as much as he has to but he could surely never have planned a victory that saw them beat the Yugoslavians by four inches or two hundredths of a second. George Digweed Clay pigeon shooting - English sporting and FITASC sporting In the non-Olympic events of the clay pigeon world George Digweed has superstar status. At Texas, in April, Digweed won his fourth world sporting title and broke his own world record in the process with a score of 195 clays from 200. Digweed, who has won 11 world titles in his career to date, is also the reigning world champion in the FITASC discipline. James Dobb Motocross 125cc champion A full 12 years after he became the youngest-ever British motocross champion James Dobb achieved his ambition of taking the world title. He turned professional as a raw-boned 15-year-old in 1987 and two years later graduated to British senior champion in the 125cc class. He suffered two broken arms in 1993. This year seven wins from the 14-race world grand-prix series realised his ambition. Jonathan Edwards Athletics - triple jump Edwards's first world title came back in 1995 at Gothenburg. That summer the Newcastle athlete could do little wrong, establishing a world record of 18.29m which still stands. By Edmonton Edwards had reached the vintage stage of his career but the 35-year-old still cruised to a second world title and the recent intimation that he may retire after the Commonwealth Games next summer will have cheered his rivals no end. Kelly Fisher Billiards - women The 23-year-old from Stourbridge won the world title at Swindon in April, where she beat Emma Bonney in the final. In the qualifying rounds of the world snooker championships she was knocked out by Sharon Dickson. Paul Foster Indoor bowls - mens' individual Foster won his first world indoor title at Preston as a 100-1 outsider in 1998. At his year's championships at Hopton-on-Sea in Norfolk the Scot came up against his compatriot and three-time world champion Richard Corsie. Despite going a set down, the Ayrshire postman with the idiosyncratic delivery stride came back to win the next three sets and claim his second world crown. Peter Gilchrist Billiards - professional Mike Russell may have hung on to the world No1 slot for six years but he still had to concede the word title to his fellow Englishman at Mumbai, India, in April. In a four-hour final Gilchrist won his second world title by a score of 1,287-863, the 33-year-old from Middlesbrough collecting a first prize of \u00a312,000. Les Gillett and Mark McMahon Indoor bowls - pairs Chipping Norton's Les Gillett and Brighton's Mark McMahon won a tense five-set world final in January against the Scots Hugh Duff and Paul Foster. The event was in Norfolk and the Scots complained of the ardent support by the crowd for the English pair, which extended to cheering the Scots' poor shots. Trina Gulliver Darts The womens' world championships took place at the tail-end of the mens' championships at Frimley Green in Surrey and Trina Gulliver, who has won just about everything else in the sport, became the first world champion proper. The 31-year-old from Warwickshire has been a professional for the past four years and tours with Kevin Painter as part of a Beauty &amp; The Beast Roadshow, presumably as the Beauty. Anna Hemmings and Helen Gilby Canoeing - marathon singles (Hemmings) and doubles Anna Hemmings, above, and Helen Gilby upheld the British tradition of winning world marathon titles, and they did it in style at the championship at Stockton-on-Tees this year. Hemmings had won her first marathon title in 1999 in Hungary but last year the Surrey paddler switched her priorities, abandoning the marathon distance (2 hours' paddling) in favour of the Olympic 1,000m distance (four minutes' paddling). In Stockton the speed training stood her in good stead. Hemmings figured in two of the closest races in the nine-year history of the championships. In the singles she won by nine seconds; with Gilby in the pairs the margin was only four seconds. For Gilby it was a first world title. So Hemmings, who is 25 today, became the first woman since the championships began to win both kayak events. Jeremy Henry Lawn bowls - singles Jeremy Henry was only 22 when he collected his first world title at Adelaide in 1996. Sammy Allen was his partner that day when they took the pairs title for Northern Ireland. Henry, partnering Neil Booth this time, could not retain that title at last year's championships but the Portrush player went one better, winning the singles crown instead. Margaret Johnston Lawn bowls - women's singles The Ballymoney bowler, twice a Commonwealth gold medallist and five times world champion, must surely rank as the finest female bowler in the history of the sport. Her most recent world title, in New South Wales last year, was undoubtedly the most controversial. In the singles preliminaries her defeat by Scotland's Margaret Letham seemed to have cost her a title chance, but a post-match appeal by Johnston saw Letham disqualified for an incorrect bias on her bowls and Johnston duly went on to win the final. Dougie Lampkin Motorcycling - indoor and outdoor trials Arguably Britain's most successful sportsman, having won five indoor and five outdoor world titles in succession. Lampkin was a child star on a bike, but that was hardly surprising as his dad Martin won the world trials title back in 1975 and his uncle Arthur was a 60s legend, winning world scrambling titles when ITV took the sport seriously. Lampkin's first season in the senior ranks was 1993, and the first championship point he earned in Andorra convinced his dad that Dougie would follow in the family footsteps. As if to prove the point, later that season he won the European championship. The Yorkshire-born rider made relentless progress thereafter, eventually winning his first world title indoors in 1997. Since then Lampkin has been so dominant in the sport that world championships are invariably settled long before the final event. The 25-year-old has one remaining ambition in the world of motorbike gymnastics, to beat the record of seven outdoor titles in a row won by Spain's Jordi Tarres. Margaret Letham and Joyce Lindores Lawn bowls - pairs Margaret Letham sulked so much about the post-match disqualification that cost her a chance of the world singles title in Australia (see Margaret Johnston above), that she didn't even turn up for the sixth-place play-off match. The doubles made her happier, though, because with her partner Joyce Lindores, her fellow Scot, she beat the Australian pairing of Arrienne Wynan and Karen Murphy to become a world champion after all. Lennox Lewis Boxing - WBC and IBF heavyweight To all intents and purposes, the undisputed world champion after disposing of Hasim Rahman in a perfunctory fashion in Las Vegas last month. Just one more fight beckons for Lewis, against Mike Tyson in April, after which he'll chill out in Jamaica. He could be one of the few boxing world champions to retire and mean it. Patricia Lovell Archery - barebow The modern bow is a sophisticated implement, with every technological assistance imaginable. Not the barebow, though. It is as its name suggests, as naked as a bow can be, and the 49-year-old Patricia Lovell has twice proved herself the best woman in the world at using it, her latest victory coming in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, last year. James Male and Mark Hue Williams Rackets - singles (Male) and doubles In the rarefied world of rackets James Male has been singularly successful. The former Radley pupil won his first world title in 1988, aged 23, and kept it for the next 11 years. It should be noted, though, that in those 11 years he defended his title only three times. He lost the title, to Neil Smith, through injury but reclaimed it in the two-leg final (New York and London) this year and added the doubles with Mark Hue Williams for good measure. Andy Mapple Waterskiing - tournament slalom Mapple may have almost reached the veteran stage - he will be 40 in March - but as he showed in this year's world championships in Italy he simply has no peers in slalom waterskiing. Mapple, whose Preston accent has long since given way to a transatlantic twang, claimed his sixth world title. Alex Marshall and George Sneddon Lawn bowls - pairs Alex Marshall got his hands on this title for the first time in 1992, when he partnered Richard Corsie. His second title came in Marks Park in Johannesburg last year with the Australian-born George Sneddon. It was a case of a good young 'un (Marshall was 33) paired with a good old 'un (Sneddon was 50) and in the final, against the South Africans Shaun Addinall and Gerry Baker, they romped home. Lester Noble Sailing - 10sq metre canoe Noble is renaissance man, having been four times British windsurfing champion (1981-84), a British international on mountain bikes and the world champion sailing the International 10sq metre canoe. He won the sailing title in 1999 but as the next world championship on the whippet-quick racers is not until next year in Rhode Island he still reigns supreme. Bob Nudd and the England Team Angling - team coarse fishing Bob Nudd didn't win the world individual championships this year, but for the seventh time in his career he was part of the winning team. Will Raison, Steve Gardener, Stuart Conroy and Alan Scotthorne were his team-mates but none can match Nudd's record, not even three-time champion Scotthorne. Nudd won the first of his four titles in Maribor, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia), his second in Szeged, Hungary, and after the third in Nottingham in 1994 the Angling Times ran a campaign to get him elected BBC Sports Personality of the Year, but the votes were discounted. Nudd, who won his fourth individual title in Toledo, Spain, two years ago, was turned on to competitive angling in the late 70s when he took part in an event in Northern Ireland. \"I'd been drunk the night before and the next day caught 166lb 9oz of roach, which was over 500 fish and close to the world record. I won \u00a33,000 and thought, I'll have a crack at this,\" he recalled. Ronnie O'Sullivan Snooker When Rocket Ronnie became the youngest-ever winner of a ranking tournament, back in 1993 when he was 17, it seemed a certainty that his name would be etched on the world championship trophy sooner rather than later. O'Sullivan, though, was profligate with his talents, losing at the semi-final stage in 1998 and 1999 and in the first round last year to the little-known David Gray. This year there was even talk of retirement, which may have helped to take the pressure off. In Sheffield he was relaxed and brilliant and world champion. Sarah Stevenson Taekwondo (under 72kg) Decisions went against Stevenson in the sport's Olympic baptism, the 17-year-old narrowly missing the bronze medal in the 67kg category. But in November, at the world championships in Korea, she beat the Chinese Zhong Chen in the middleweight final. Now the Doncaster fighter is hoping to give up her estate agent job to prepare properly for Athens and another tilt at Olympic gold. St Helens Rugby League St Helens beat Brisbane Broncos last year to claim the world club championship yet the current Super League champions Bradford Bulls are due to defend it against the Newcastle Knights in January. It is a small world, though; just England and Australia. Phil Taylor Darts (PDC version) \"The Power\" should be ready to let someone else have a go; he has been world champion for nine straight years. But there was no sign of Taylor waning last January, with only a single set dropped during the entire Professional Darts Corporation event. Next week's contest will be tougher, with new players joining the \"rebel championship's\" ranks. But supporters could still be singing \"Walking in a Taylor Wonderland\" one more time. John Winn Clay pigeon shooting (down the line) Down the line, or DTL, is not Olympic, but it is one of the oldest disciplines. Winn shoots for the Anchor Valley Club in Lincolnshire and is one of three British shotgun world champions. With Richard Faulds an Olympic champion as well, the sport is in good nick. Women's 4x200m freestyle relay Swimming This is one world title the British women should not celebrate too much, having won it because someone else did just that. In Japan at the world championships Nicola Jackson, Janine Belton, Karen Legg and Karen Pickering were third best. But the United States, finishing second, were disqualified for a faulty takeover (later found not to be faulty, so they too were awarded gold medals), while the Australians, who won, were disqualified when Petria Thomas leapt into the pool while the Italians were still swimming. World champions they may be but still third best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
