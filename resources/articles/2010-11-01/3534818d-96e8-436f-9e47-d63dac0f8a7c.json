Wales was where his Test career started and he was in charge of the men in red when the Millennium Stadium staged its first match in 1999, plotting a famous victory over South Africa, Wales's first and only win against the Springboks. Henry has spent some of the week catching up with old friends but any sympathy, or indeed empathy given the way his own promising start with Wales disintegrated, he has for the hosts' coach, and fellow New Zealander, Warren Gatland, will evaporate on Saturday evening as the All Blacks look to equal South Africa's record of four grand slams on tours of the home unions. They claimed two of the previous three under Henry in 2005 and 2008. Henry is expected to stand down after next year's World Cup, regardless of whether the All Blacks end two decades of misery in the tournament. He will be 65 then having coached an international side for 11 of the previous 13 years. New Zealand's success rate under him is more than 85% and he is regarded as one of the leading coaches in the game, but he knows he will be judged by whether he delivers the Webb Ellis Trophy. \"The expectation is that the All Blacks win,\" he said. \"I think that's good because it brings out the best in people. We talked about the grand slam before we played Ireland last week: we said we would not have a chance unless we did the business in Dublin. There have been 24 grand slam opportunities for the southern hemisphere sides, but only eight have been taken. South Africa have not done it since 1961 and Australia's only time was 1984. It is 26 years since anyone but the All Blacks achieved it and we would like to add to that legacy.\" It is eight years since New Zealand lost a tour match in Europe (though Henry will never be allowed to forget the World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Cardiff in 2007). The defeat by England at Twickenham in November 2002was followed by a draw in France, but since then they have won 23 matches in succession, 22 of them under Henry, and had two grand slam tours of the home unions. All-time, including World Cups, New Zealand have won 57 Tests and drawn four out of 68 on British and Irish soil. Wales have come closest to ending the present run, losing 26-25 in 2004, the same margin as in 1978, the year of New Zealand's first grand slam. \"Our challenge is that we have played 13 Tests in the last five months and the guys are starting to feel the pinch a bit,\" said Henry. \"They started in February and are still going at the end of November. We are not overdoing it this week and are concentrating on getting their heads right. Wales will be a challenge and I am not taking notice of their draw with Fiji last week. They were very competitive against Australia and South Africa and they will be on Saturday.\" Henry would not be drawn on why consistency is so elusive for Wales. During his time in charge, they won 10 successive Tests, their best run for 90 years, but he never stopped trying to play down expectation, something he has never done with the All Blacks, likening Wales to a shower that was either too hot or too cold. Gatland started with a grand slam but Wales have won only two Tests this year out of 11 and Henry's reign ended after four defeats in five matches in 2001-02. \"I like coming back to Wales,\" he said. \"I had a very interesting three-and-a-half years here and enjoyed coaching the Welsh side. It is good to come back and see people I have a lot of respect for. There is always an edge when you come up against a team you once had an association with and especially so when they have a Kiwi in charge. I am a bit surprised that Wales have not kicked on: they are a good rugby side and some of the games against the Tri-Nations countries have been touch and go. I do not know why they have come up short but their time will come, I'm sure.\" The Wales kicking coach, Neil Jenkins, resurrected his international career under Henry, becoming the first player to reach 1,000 points in international rugby. Now it is the New Zealand outside\u2011half, Dan Carter, who has a record in his sights. Carter, struggling to overcome an ankle strain, is a penalty kick away from overtaking Jonny Wilkinson as the leading scorer in Test rugby, having made his debut against Wales in 2003. \"Graham was a breath of fresh air,\" said Jenkins. \"My career benefited from working with him and I would rate him as probably the best coach in the history of the game. His record speaks for itself. Wales fell apart a bit under him towards the end, but that was not down to Graham. We developed as a side under him and I look forward to having a bit of banter with him after the game. He is a great guy as well as a top coach.\" The grand slam is Henry's immediate goal. The World Cup is New Zealand's holy grail. Only once have they prevailed, back in 1987, and Henry, uniquely, survived a failed assault in 2007. Being top of the world rankings will mean little come September next year. Henry said in Ireland that he would be dead if New Zealand failed to win the World Cup. He was more reflective this week. \"I am pleased with where we are, generally speaking. We have learned about players on this tour. Some have been exceptionally positive, others have not quite got there. The Super 15 should sort out some selection issues. We have seen on this tour that the European challenge in the World Cup will be demanding and they will rate their chances pretty highly. To become world champions, you will have to be able to defend as well as attack. Both will be equally important.\" New Zealand in Europe under Henry Record: 100%.
