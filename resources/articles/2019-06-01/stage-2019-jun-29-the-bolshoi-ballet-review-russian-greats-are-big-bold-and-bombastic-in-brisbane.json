And it\u2019s not just in numbers that the Bolshoi reflects the definition of its name: the ballet is big in style, confidence, energy and passion too. The dual program for QPAC pairs the Brisbane premieres of two complete productions: the legendary spectacle, Yuri Grigorovich\u2019s epic showcase Spartacus; and George Balanchine\u2019s neoclassical Jewels, which makes its Australian debut by the company on Saturday night. Both are from the 1960s, and both are signature pieces from their choreographers. Spartacus\u2019 story of a do-or-die gladiatorial rebellion against enslavement has a universal appeal \u2013 and for 51 years, the Bolshoi interpretation has been considered the definitive one. My introduction to it was in 1985, when I saw a single act in Brisbane danced by Irek Mukhamedov \u2013 and the power, dynamism and intensity of Mukhamedov and the male ranks made a lasting impression. On the current season\u2019s opening night on Thursday, Igor Tsvirko gives us another memorable Spartacus, with soaring leaps, fierce attack and strong partnering delivered with a commanding presence and robust virility \u2013 requisites for the role. Renowned for featuring male strength, Spartacus contrasts two opposing worlds. Stone edifices, imperial insignias and militaristic troop formations depict an austere and oppressive Roman landscape; while the lack of embellishment in the slaves\u2019 costuming and setting concentrates on their humanity. Despite a dramatic opening, its energy is somewhat contained and takes a while to build. Given the length of the ballet (nearly three hours), bursts of virtuosic dancing are strategically spaced rather than constant, and come mostly from the leads rather than the group movement \u2013 which does become slightly repetitive at times. With a touring cast of 90, Spartacus still registers as an impressive spectacle, but it\u2019s not always as viscerally exciting as one might hope. While much of the work in the solos and pas de deux is timeless, parts of other sections remain rooted firmly, and somewhat jarringly, in 1960s balletic conventions. On one hand there are busy expressionistic responses to Aram Khachaturyan\u2019s stirring music (performed by Queensland Symphony Orchestra; conducted by the Bolshoi\u2019s Pavel Sorokin); and on the other, merely suggestive symbolism in the orgy scene \u2013 both of which sit outside today\u2019s preference for organic realism. But the musical motifs in Khachaturyan\u2019s score given to the four leads are effective and expressive, with the refrain accompanying Spartacus\u2019 wife Phrygia most recognisable (to my generation as the theme from The Onedin Line). First soloist Margarita Shrayner is lovely in this role, projecting a pliant openness and yearning in divine pas de deux (not surprisingly, she and Tsvirko are a real-life couple). The planes and shapes of the lifts are artistically beautiful with a technical wow-factor \u2013 especially the famous single-arm overhead press. Played by principals Alexander Volchkov and Olga Smirnova, Roman leader Crassus and his courtesan Aegina are a diabolical double. It is the even more scheming Aegina who emerges as Spartacus\u2019 dramatic match, in a mesmerising performance by Smirnova. Her nuanced interpretation is as exquisite as her perfect ballerina physique, her imperious bearing, flickering facial expressions and utter physical command oozing ruthless calculated sensuality. Jewels, which opens on Saturday, was inspired by the gemstones glittering from the windows of New York designers Van Cleef and Arpels, and represents them in three distinct acts: Emeralds, Rubies and Diamonds. Staged as the inside of a jewellery box, the patterns of the corps de ballet represent the shapes of its contents \u2013 and for those new to ballet, or preferring abstract dance, the performance should provide a striking overview of the artform. Emeralds is famous for evoking the essence of French romantic ballet, delicate and demure in Degas greens echoing Faure\u2019s dreamy concert suites. In Rubies, the dancers represent the notes and rhythms of Stravinsky\u2019s jazz-age Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra; it\u2019s an expression of New York razzamatazz: sassy, showy, playful and lightning-fast. With a symphonic Tchaikovsky score, Diamonds pays homage to imperial Russian heritage with regal elegance and dazzling purity and precision, culminating in a stunning display of unison by its 34 dancers. Whatever you take away from the works themselves, the calibre of the artists in conjunction with the collective weight of the company\u2019s illustrious history are what make the Bolshoi worth seeing. It\u2019s a synergetic experience, bigger (yet again) than the mere instruments allowing them to shine. \u2022 The Bolshoi Ballet is at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane, until 7 July; the season includes a free Queensland regional simulcast of Spartacus on 6 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
