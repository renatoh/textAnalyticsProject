News of his death came as figures emerged indicating that UK forces in the southern Helmand province are experiencing casualties at a significantly faster rate than during the worst fighting in Iraq. The soldier, from 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, died on a routine patrol near the town of Lashkar Gah on Friday. He was the 16th UK soldier to have died since early May, a rate of almost one fatality every three days. Death rates have reached 15 per 1,000 personnel years, a calculation that takes into account the number of soldiers deployed and the period of time they are deployed. The figure for Iraq stood at 7.5 per 1,000 personnel years during the fiercest fighting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
