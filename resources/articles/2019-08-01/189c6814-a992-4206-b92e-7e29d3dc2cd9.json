The president said the internet provided a \u201cdangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds\u201d on Monday, in his first public remarks about the mass shootings that left 22 dead in El Paso, Texas, and another nine dead in Dayton, Ohio, over the weekend. \u201cThe shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet, and stop mass murders before they start.\u201d The white nationalist screed by the suspect in the El Paso shooting was indeed posted in one of the those dark corners of the web: the extremist message board 8chan. But the language used by the alleged killer replicates language used by Trump, and his re-election campaign, not in any obscure forum but on his official Facebook and Twitter pages. The second sentence of the manifesto \u2013 \u201cThis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas\u201d \u2013 echoes white nationalist rhetoric falsely asserting that people of Latino or Hispanic descent represent an \u201cinvasion\u201d in the United States. Trump has used similar language on numerous occasions. Trump\u2019s campaign has used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe migrants seeking entry at the US-Mexico border in 2,199 Facebook ads since January, according to a Guardian analysis of Facebook\u2019s political ad archive. Those ads have been viewed between 1,059,000 and 5,559,801 times by Facebook users and cost the Trump campaign between $7,900 and $241,601 to promote. (Facebook reports spending and performance of ads as a range.) There are dozens of variations on the video clips in each ad, but just two variants of the copy. The first version reads in part: \u201cThe crisis at the Southern Border is even worse than most understand. I have taken MULTIPLE trips to the border to show the true invasion happening but the Democrats and the Fake News Media just won\u2019t listen. THE TIME IS NOW. WE NEED TO SECURE OUR BORDER! Nancy and Chuck have made it clear that they don\u2019t want to know your opinions on how to keep America safe. They don\u2019t want to know why you want the wall. But I do.\u201d This ad copy was used with different short videos, including one with a voiceover from Trump saying, \u201cLiberals care more about illegal immigrants than they do about our own citizens. It\u2019s time to put America first. We need border security,\u201d playing over what appears to be footage of migrants running toward the border wall. The ad encouraged users to click on an \u201cofficial secure the border survey\u201d, which then asks users to provide their contact information and identify their top concerns about the border from the following list: \u201cDrug trafficking, criminals, MS-13 gang members, sex trafficking, illegal aliens, terrorists, all of the above.\u201d The second version of ad copy reads in part: \u201cWe have an INVASION! So we are BUILDING THE WALL to STOP IT. Dems will sue us. But we want a SAFE COUNTRY! It\u2019s CRITICAL that we STOP THE INVASION. Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have not negotiated in good faith to fund a wall at our Southern Border, proving that OBSTRUCTION is far more important to them than YOUR SAFETY. I cannot allow America\u2019s safety and security to be put at risk any longer. We need the wall, and I must put AMERICA FIRST!\u201d These ads ran with various short videos that largely used dark and foreboding music over dark and moody images, including a series that featured pixelated images of concertina wire against a dark sky, with the slogan: \u201cAmerica\u2019s safety is at risk. This is a national emergency.\u201d These ads linked to a fundraising page rising money for Trump\u2019s campaign. The \u201cinvasion\u201d advertisements appear to have been most successful among older women. Of the 372 versions of the ads that received at least 1,000 impressions \u2013 a figure referring to the number of people who see an ad \u2013 Facebook\u2019s data revealed that 175 (47%) garnered the most impressions from women older than 55. Young men (between 25 and 34) and middle-aged men (between 55-64) were the other groups most likely to have been shown the ads. These demographic results are based in part on how a campaign chooses to target its ads and in part on how users respond to them. The most successful of the \u201cinvasion\u201d ads ran on 23 January with the second version of the copy. It was viewed by between 100,000 and 199,000 Facebook users, of whom 23.7% were men aged 25 to 34 and about 8% were from Texas. The Trump campaign spent between $500 and $999 to promote the ad. The threatening tenor of these ads is not unusual for Trump\u2019s social media campaign. Since the beginning of the year, Trump has spent more than $8.7m on Facebook advertising, much of it designed to inspire outrage or fear. Other frequent topics include the border wall, \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d. Another noteworthy ad campaign addressed the migrant \u201ccaravan\u201d from Central America that became a fixation of conservative cable news and politicians as it traveled through Mexico in the weeks before the midterms. The ads did not include the word \u201cinvasion\u201d in the copy, but did use it in a video voiceover, which said: \u201cAmerica cannot allow this invasion. The migrant caravan must be stopped.\u201d The set of six ads were launched on 5 November 2018 \u2013 the day before the US congressional elections. Facebook pulled the ads amid public outcry, but not before they were viewed by at least a million people. The video spot was also pulled from NBC and rejected by Fox News and CNN. The group most likely to have seen the caravan ads on Facebook before they were removed was men aged 25-34 in Florida and Arizona. Since Trump\u2019s remarks on Monday morning, the set of approximately 1,000 Facebook ads his campaign is running have focused on selling campaign merchandise, including plastic straws, beer cozies and baseball caps. He is also running 28 ads featuring the slogan \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d. Peter Andringa contributed reporting"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
