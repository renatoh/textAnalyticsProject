While the First Division players of Blackburn shot five goals past him in midweek, the Derby County keeper is yet to be beaten in his two top-flight appearances. Three excellent saves by the 23-year-old ensured an important point for troubled County, whose ambitions were strictly limited as they defended with depth and determination against a team they have yet to beat in the Premiership. It added up to an immensely frustrating 90 minutes for Leeds, who required a slice of good fortune or a flash of brilliance to secure a victory. They possessed neither yesterday. Leeds lacked the imagination needed to break down Derby when talented trio Alan Smith, Harry Kewell and Robbie Keane were together for the final 20 minutes. By then Oakes had added to the favourable impression created in the win over Sunderland seven days earlier. Nevertheless, Oakes's busiest spell of the game came when he spent most of the interval fielding shots from County's goalkeeping coach, presumably to make up for his lack of activity in a first half when he dealt with an effort from Robbie Keane. It proved to be time well spent because the young keeper produced athletic saves to reject long-range shots from Ian Harte and Olivier Dacourt as Leeds briefly injected some life into a moribund match after the rest. It was an unsatisfactory preparation for United's Champions League match in Anderlecht on Tuesday, though they did move up in the Premiership to fifth. O'Leary said: 'We know we can play much better, but Derby had a game plan. They didn't want to be beaten. We needed somebody like Harry Kewell playing from the start because individual brilliance gets you a goal.' There was little prospect of a goal from Derby, whose attacking contribution was a second-half shot from Malcolm Christie after he was freed by Darryl Powell. It was the only time they troubled Leeds keeper Nigel Martyn, but manager Jim Smith was not about to apologise for their approach. Smith said: 'My players stuck to their job. We would like to play pretty football, but that's the kind of performance we will have to produce when we go away for the rest of the season. 'You can't believe the same guys who defended so well here let in five in the FA Cup in midweek - but it was a serious game for Taribo West today. They don't bother with cups in Nigeria.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
