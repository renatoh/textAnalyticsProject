Over Christmas the letting agent told him the landlord had gone bust but that the property was being bought by a new owner, so the tenants need not worry. The next payment of \u00a31,125 for 15 weeks was due in mid-January and my son was told to wait for further information about the new owners. The day before his rent was due he visited the local NatWest branch to cancel the direct debit to the bankrupt company but was told this was not possible \u2013 he had to give 48 hours' notice. Apparently this was a change of policy at NatWest and the bank says it had sent him notification in the post. He has no record of receiving it. So the \u00a31,125 went to the bankrupt company and the money appears to be lost. He had to find the money over again to pay the new landlord. Banks can stop payments immediately if they suspect credit card fraud so how difficult can it be to stop a transfer the following day? LRR, Bristol We need to get a few points straight. Your son paid by standing order, not direct debit, and NatWest needs three days' notice to cancel these, not 48 hours. The bank extended this from two days in April of last year because, it says, standing orders are debited then credited to the beneficiary on the same day, so they can't be cancelled that day because the money is already in the recipient's account. NatWest can cancel direct debits at 24 hours' notice. Other banks have no such problem. They allow customers to cancel direct debits and standing orders on the same day that payment is due and will recall the money if necessary. You should not rely on this timing, though, because it is not guaranteed to work and you can't cancel online at the last moment. Ideally you should give as much notice as possible and you must make it clear if the cancellation is urgent. NatWest accepts the branch could have been more helpful when your son explained his predicament, and staff should at least have tried to stop the payment. It says there is no guarantee they would have succeeded but, because of their poor effort, is refunding your son \u00a31,125. It will try to reclaim the money from the bankrupt landlord but does not hold out much hope. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
