Chris Smalls, who had worked for Amazon for five years, was fired shortly after he helped organize a work stoppage at the company\u2019s warehouse on Staten Island, New York, in protest over a lack of protective gear and hazard pay for employees. Amazon claims it fired Smalls for \u201cviolating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk\u201d. Amazon\u2019s general counsel, David Zapolsky, in notes from a meeting of top executives obtained by Vice, wrote: \u201cHe\u2019s not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we\u2019re trying to protect workers.\u201d The meeting is held daily to brief Bezos, the chief executive, on issues related to the coronavirus pandemic. Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice-president of corporate affairs, described it on CNN as a \u201cbrainstorming\u201d meeting. Zapolsky added: \u201cWe should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer\u2019s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety. \u201cMake him the most interesting part of the story, and if possible make him the face of the entire union/organizing movement.\u201d Smalls\u2019 termination has drawn widespread condemnation from labor supporters and politicians, including the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, and Bernie Sanders, who called the firing \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Retaliation against workers for engaging in collective action related to their working conditions is illegal under federal law. Writing in the Guardian on Thursday, Smalls said he thought he was \u201ctargeted\u201d by Amazon because he had received media attention for organizing the protest. He also alleged that Amazon failed to disclose a worker\u2019s illness to the rest of the workforce , prompting him to contact public health officials and eventually organize the demonstration. \u201cI am getting calls from Amazon workers across the country and they all want to stage walk-outs, too,\u201d Smalls wrote. \u201cWe are starting a revolution and people around the country support us.\u201d Amazon says it asked Smalls to remain home for 14 days after he had \u201cclose contact\u201d with another worker who was diagnosed with Covid-19, and that by attending the protest he was putting other employees at risk. The company has continued to push this narrative on Twitter, with Carney, a former press secretary for Barack Obama who joined Amazon in 2015, engaging in back-and-forth about the issue with Sanders and others. On Wednesday evening, Carney decried \u201cfolks on Twitter who respond to facts and ideas they don\u2019t like with ad hominem vitriol\u201d. Zapolsky, the Amazon executive who called Smalls \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d, released a statement following publication of the remarks, which read: \u201cMy comments were personal and emotional. I was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians by repeatedly returning to the premises after having been warned to quarantine himself after exposure to virus Covid-19. I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me.\u201d Dania Rajendra, the director of Athena, a coalition of labor and community groups campaigning against Amazon, decried the memo. She said in a statement: \u201cHundreds of Amazon workers are telling the public about the risk Amazon poses to their health, their families and the communities they live in \u2013 and we\u2019ve got Amazon execs, working from home, trying to fix the PR problem instead of the public health problem. \u201cAmazon top brass chose tired, racist insinuations and snarky tweets. A better choice would be to make a plan that takes worker and public health seriously.\u201d Smalls released a statement responding to the leaked memo Thursday evening. \u201cAmazon wants to make this about me, but whether Jeff Bezos likes it or not, this is about Amazon workers \u2013 and their families \u2013 everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of protecting workers and the communities in which they work, however, Amazon seems to be more interested in managing its image \u2026 This is not about me. This is about all of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
