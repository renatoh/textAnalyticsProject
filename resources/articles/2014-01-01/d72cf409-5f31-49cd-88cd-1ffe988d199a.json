But don\u2019t worry, because Tom Cruise\u2019s character will return in EVERY SINGLE FILM THAT TOM CRUISE WOULD EVER SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE. Thanks for joining in, by the way. And follow me on Twitter, if you like (I\u2019m @StuHeritage). Next week: I\u2019ll be liveblogging a film that\u2019s much less stupid. I\u2019m sad too. Tom goes back to Top Gun specifically so that Kelly McGillis can jump him. I swear to god, if I see his tongue go into her mouth again, I'm going to vomit my spine out. Tom Cruise lands on the aircraft carrier. He punches the air in victory, not knowing that the full terrifying power of the Soviet army is probably about to be unleashed in vengeance. Then he throws Goose's dogtags into the sea, because screw that guy now that he's a hero. There's one Russian plane left, but Tom Cruise only has one missile left. There's one thing for it - a needlessly ostentatious piece of stunt-flying. It works! The plane explodes, the pilot dies in agony and the horrible Noel Edmonds music plays. Tom Cruise is a hero again! Tom Cruise is back in action! He's killing Russians all over the place. Forget that, if this actually happened, Top Gun would end with Tom Cruise watching everyone he's ever loved inhaling radioactive fallout and dying. He's killing Russians! Hooray for Tom Cruise! The Russians killed one of the non-Cruises. But it's OK, because here's Tom Cruise to save the day! Never mind that fatalities caused by a high-speed dogfight between Russia and America in 1986 would have almost definitely brought about instant nuclear retaliation, the onset of World War Three and the end of human life on Earth as we know it. This bit's important because Tom Cruise needs a happy ending. Some unfortunately non-Cruise pilots are already in the air, looking for the Russians. This cannot end well, because none of them are Tom Cruise, and I'm starting to suspect that Tom Cruise wrote 'I MUST BE THE ONLY ONE GOOD AT AEROPLANES' in giant letters across his Top Gun contract with a crayon. This'll snap Tom Cruise out of his funk, though - a bunch of Russians are planning to blow everything up, which means that he might get to kill people for real! Russian people! Possibly while that horrible Noel Edmonds music plays! This is like Christmas Day a trillion times over for him. So Tom Cruise goes and cheers himself up by looking at aeroplanes. That's right - Tom Cruise likes to cheer himself up by looking at the exact things that killed his best friend and father. I think he might need to look at his own bedside cabinet, to be perfectly honest. One of Tom Cruise's bosses used to fly with Tom Cruise's dad. He tries to cheer Tom Cruise up by describing how his dad died in absurdly gory detail. I'm just putting this out there, but he might want to look at his bedside manner. \"You're the best of the best\" McGillis tells Tom. \"That means you make mistakes\". I didn't realise that mistakes were a sign of brilliance. Turns out I'm a genius in every single aspect of my life, then. Who knew? It's all too much for Tom Cruise. He quits Top Gun in favour of falling asleep next to some lemonade in a bar. Kelly McGillis tries to talk him out of his decision, mainly by listing all the different ways that Tom Cruise is better than all other men. But this film has been 98% people listing all the different ways that Tom Cruise is better than all other men, so he doesn't really absorb it very well. An enquiry deems that Goose's death wasn't Tom Cruise's fault (obviously, because he's Tom Cruise). However, the tragedy throws Cruise off his game. He shouts at everyone. In a sad way, not in that weird oversincere 'Hey, I'm just like one of you guys!' way that he does in all of his other films. Goose's wife is obviously distraught. \"The worst part of this is that he'll never get to witness your undisputed godlike genius ever again,\" she tells Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise nods. He knows. He knows. Tom Cruise grieves for Goose the only way he knows how; by stripping down to his pants and staring at himself in a mirror for what could be anything up to twelve full hours. Meanwhile, back on the planes, Maverick and Goose are in trouble. Their plane is spinning out of control. They need to eject. Tom Cruise lands safely, but Goose dies. His final words, \"I meant that thing about stitching a vagina onto my leg, you know\" are as touching as they are tragic. Also, if you're keeping count, Goose's wife just said to Kelly McGillis \"MY GOD Tom Cruise is the most brilliant son of a bitch I have ever laid eyes on. I'm only married to Goose so I can be close to Tom Cruise. I want to shave every hair on his head, bundle it all up into a ball and put it in my mouth. He is literally like ten Jesuses put together\". Meanwhile in a pub, Goose is playing Great Balls of Fire on a piano in a restaurant. That's right, Goose is the sort of person who plays pianos in restaurants without prompting. Imagine being in a restaurant and having to endure that awful cack. Goose is reprehensible. Except, no, Tom Cruise lost the simulation. All the other pilots and instructors take him to task for it, saying \"GODDAMN YOU Tom Cruise, you fly like a genius. That's why you lost that simulation, you know. It's because you're just too good\". I'm not sure exactly what's going on in these planes, but Goose keeps saying \"MY GOD Tom Cruise, this is the most effortlessly virtuoso display of piloting I have ever seen. As soon as I leave here, I'm going to surgically splice a vagina onto my thigh so that you can hump me, you brilliant son of a bitch\", which means that it must be good. Back in the planes. \"I feel the need. The need for speed\" says Tom Cruise, immediately causing the man who decided that the words 'need' and 'speed' should rhyme to curse himself for his own stupidity. I genuinely can't liveblog this bit because every time I look at the screen I see Tom Cruise sticking his tongue into Kelly McGillis's mouth and it sort of makes me want to vomit tears out of my bum. Honestly, I think that's the most gruesome thing I've ever, ever seen. Oh god. They're having sex now. Oh GOD. Now some more authority figures are laying into Tom Cruise for being unorthodox and brilliant. Except, uh oh, one of those authority figures is Kelly McGillis. This is the catalyst for what would normally be called a lover's tiff, if there was even a single microscopic scrap of sexual chemistry between them. Suddenly, for reasons that I honestly can't work out, Kelly McGillis and Tom Cruise are now in a lift together. \"I don't usually invite pilots to my house,\" she says \"But GODDAMN IT, Tom Cruise you are the greatest man who ever lived\". Now for the scene where Tom Cruise discusses his father with a faraway look in his eyes. This apparently just turns Kelly McGillis on more than ever. Tom Cruise makes a mental note to talk about his dead dad in front of more girls, because he is a sociopath. At dinner, Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis attempt to drink wine without breaking eye contact with each other. It's sexy. Or at least it would be, except Tom Cruise is so busy looking at Kelly McGillis that he misses his mouth and pours all his wine into his lap and starts crying. Tom Cruise looks like Dean Gaffney. And now the volleyball scene. There's lots of topless men high-fiving each other in a needlessly aggressive way and a man singing a boys and it goes on for approximately six full hours. AND IT WORKS. McGillis invites Tom Cruise out for dinner. Which just goes to show that your bosses and teachers like nothing more than relentless sexual harassment. A lesson for us all. In training, Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis discuss dogfighting by basically saying the word 'sex' to each other again and again and waggling their eyebrows up and down. Also, it turns out that Tom Cruise's dad was a brilliant but flawed fighter pilot, and nobody will ever listen to anything that Tom Cruise says because his father's shadow is too big. Which pretty much makes Top Gun the Connor Cruise story. And now all the authority figures are sitting around indoors discussing what to do with Tom Cruise. They could kick him out for breaking the rules, but they know how inherently brilliant he is so they won't. Maybe they'll just downgrade him from 'Maverick' to 'Orthodox'. That'd certainly teach him. Oh, it is happening in real life, because Tom Cruise just buzzed an observation tower and an uptight authority figure spilled coffee on himself, shouted \"GODDAMN YOU TOM CRUISE, YOU GLORIOUS SON OF A BITCH\" and then stared at the camera licking his lips for ten minutes. And now there's a jet scene. Tom Cruise is simulating a dogfight with another pilot, but the last three scenes have blurred the lines between aeroplanes and genitals so much that I'm slightly convinced that this scene is only happening in Tom Cruise's mind, and in reality they're just standing in a toilet cubible slapping their willies around. Back at Top Gun and, whaddaya know, Kelly McGillis is Tom Cruise's boss. She immediately gets haughty and pulls rank, but Tom Cruise says \"I'm really good at flying aeroplanes\" and winks and points his thumb at his penis, and she blushes and wets her knickers. It's ON. Kelly McGillis goes to the toilet. Bereft because he can't make any more tedious flirty smalltalk where he discusses his skill as a fighter pilot while winking and gesturing at his crotch every time he says the word 'jet', Tom Cruise follows her in. Which is awful, obviously. Everyone in this film is awful. At the bar that night, all the pilots play Who Can Go To The Crappiest Bar Full Of The Worst-Dressed People And Drink The Most Brightly-Coloured Beverages While Wearing Outfits That Are Bound To Stain Within Ten Seconds Of Putting Them On. And Tom Cruise wins. To celebrate, he sings You've Lost That Loving Feeling to Kelly McGillis. And, rather than immediately stab him in the heart with a shard of frozen urine, she laughs. I automatically do not trust her for this precise reason. They're all at Top Gun now. An instructor is saying \"You're the best fighter pilots in the whole world, but we can make you better\". Tom Cruise says \"I can shoot lasers out of my penis\". The instructor says \"I love you, you tremendous Adonis\". The bald one from Masters of the Universe is all like \"GODDAMN IT! Tom Cruise, you risked lives and millions of dollars and the entire reputation of the US Air Force out there. I should take your wings, but instead I'm sending you to Top Gun because, GODDAMN IT, your brilliance brings me to tears. You're barely even a person at this point. You're like a god, you beautiful bastard\". You know, just like someone does in all Tom Cruise films. Cougar's bugging out. His jet's running low on fuel and he's refusing to return to base. He's going to crash! Except he's not, because Tom Cruise has turned around to save him. \"GODDAMN IT, MAVERICK!\" shouts the bald one from Masters of the Universe, because this is a Tom Cruise film and if there isn't an uptight authority figure cursing his unorthodox brilliance at every turn, then we won't realise how great Tom Cruise is, and that will make Tom Cruise sad. But wait! They weren't scared off. They've come back, and they've got missile lock on Cougar. So Tom Cruise does the Tom Cruiseiest thing of all time. He flips his plane upside down, flies it an inch above the Russian plane and gives him the finger. Also, when Tom Cruise gives Russians the finger, music that you suspect Noel Edmonds would like automatically starts playing. This film is awesome. So then, the film. Tom Cruise and Cougar and Goose are all flying around in their aeroplanes, making impenetrable smalltalk with each other. But then they see more aeroplanes, and those aeroplanes are from a different gang, so Tom Cruise scares them off. 'Indian Ocean: present day'. If it's the present day, that means all these moustaches are ironic. I don't know if that's comforting or not. So who else forgot that Top Gun started with so many establishing shots of people silently and painstakingly doing lots of mundane workaday jobs on aircraft carriers that the whole thing lasts for two entire songs before anything even happens? Me too. Oh, there was just an onscreen legend that I missed. I'm pretty sure it just said 'Tom Cruise is great' over and over again in Tom Cruise's handwriting. Maybe we'll never know. The film begins. Something that sounds like but isn't Do They Know It's Christmas plays. It isn't Christmas, by the way, just in case you rely on second-rate liveblogs of films on television to tell you what time of year it is. It isn't Christmas, OK? So, ladies and gentlemen, with strong language: TOP GUN. Have I mentioned that I haven't watched Top Gun for about 15 years, and that I can't really remember anything that happens in it? No? Oh well, too late, it's about to start. TOP GUN. Oh! I haven't shown you the Top Gun trailer yet, have I? Strap yourselves in, folks. Strap yourselves in for TOP GUN. Hello one and all, and welcome to this week\u2019s TV on the Box liveblog. Tonight, for those of you who have E4 and a social life as humiliatingly minuscule as my own, I will be liveblogging the 1986 action extravaganza Top Gun. Ah, Top Gun. The film that Cocktail would have been, if it had been about aeroplanes. The film that Days of Thunder would have been, if it had a gratuitous topless volleyball sequence in it. The film that Far and Away would have been, if only Kenny Loggins shouted songs about boys and cars all the way through it. Top Gun is notable for many reasons. If you want to see what Val Kilmer looked like before he became a late-period Marlon Brando tribute act, you watch Top Gun. If you want to see what Tom Cruise looked like in 1986 (SPOILER: he looked EXACTLY THE SAME), you watch Top Gun. If you want to see the only film ever made where Tom Cruise plays a brilliant but unconventional hothead who begrudgingly learns an important lesson about respect, you watch Top Gun. Top Gun! Top Gun starts on E4 at 9pm. I will be there. You, in all fairness, probably won\u2019t be. But that doesn\u2019t matter, though, because it\u2019s Top Gun.
