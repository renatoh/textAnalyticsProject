Two decades on, their fifth album doesn\u2019t journey too far from the sound of old hits such as Tattva and Govinda: it starts with a flourish of sitars, and finds frontman Crispian Mills roaring \u201cWe are one, the infinite sun\u201d. The blond-locked frontman hasn\u2019t lost his gift for tunes, and Holy Flame is reminiscent of Blur\u2019s Coffee and TV. Death of Democracy is a cheery political knees-up, and the quasi-mystical Hari Bol (The Sweetest Sweet) veers towards self-parody. However, perhaps chastened by a fall from grace and spells in the wilderness, Mills also displays a reflective side, addressing his \u201cdarkest days\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d with touching candour. Their big moment in the sun has long gone, but there\u2019s enough here for an Indian summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
