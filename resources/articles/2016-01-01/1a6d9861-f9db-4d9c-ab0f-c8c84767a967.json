Sounds like your typical indie movie drama, right? Well, too bad this isn\u2019t a movie, it\u2019s a web series made for Refinery 29, a lifestyle site aimed at millennial women. Oh, and it\u2019s not a drama at all, it\u2019s a comedy. The Skinny, a series of six episodes around 10-minutes long released to the public concurrent to its festival debut, follows a wannabe feminist YouTube star also named Jessie as she tries to strike it big in the cut-throat world of social media influencers. Just to make life even harder, her boyfriend Cole (Spencer Hill) just got out of rehab and her overbearing mother (Ileana Douglas, also an executive producer) is after her to make something of her life. All of this manages to cause Jessie\u2019s body image issues and struggle with bulimia to flare up. Yes, it all sounds dreadfully serious, but it\u2019s a testament to Kahnweiler\u2019s charisma and talent that she manages to find the humour in these situations and pull it off. Especially engaging is the series\u2019 third episode, where she teams up with a trio of 19-year-old Vine stars in the hopes that she can go viral and get even more attention on her YouTube videos. Each episode includes a snippet of one Jessie\u2019s YouTube videos, which are Kahnweiler\u2019s actual uploads, like one where she tries to \u201cfuck a vet\u201d. These are especially valuable because after watching them the audience knows that Jessie has what it takes to be the next big thing. It\u2019s also evident that if people who teach how to put on eyeliner have millions of followers, Kahnweiler deserves twice that. However, like so much on YouTube, The Skinny can be overly sincere and didactic, taking on the tone of an after-school special or one of the old \u201cwomen\u2019s issue films\u201d at times. Kahnweiler has spoken about her own issues surrounding eating disorders in the past, but the way the symptoms are manifested in almost humorous binges (no one would honestly try to eat a whole stalk of Romaine lettuce in a mouthful) sometimes make it seem as if she\u2019s making light of them. The series\u2019 strength lies in the way its characters are written. Jessie, Cole and Jessie\u2019s mother are all fully rounded, with frailties and failings that nevertheless don\u2019t define them. Jessie\u2019s struggles with weight and identity are just one aspect of a complex and funny woman, and when that is evident, the show really shines. These moments may be the hand of Transparent creator Jill Soloway, who pulls this off so wonderfully on her own series and who executive-produced this project with Andrea Sperling and Rebecca Odes. Kahnweiler is a great talent who someday will make something absolutely genius, possibly on a platform that hasn\u2019t been invented yet. While The Skinny is a highly enjoyable web series, it\u2019s a few steps shy from being mind-blowing. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s almost there. The Skinny is one of a number of television shows that premiered at this year\u2019s festival in the Special Events section but most of the others are either airing on conventional cable channels or the holy triumvirate of established streaming services: Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. Refinery29 is the only website represented and that sure takes some chutzpah. The Skinny is one of 29 original series that R29 is introducing this year in a big push towards original video content it announced last spring. It is produced to a very high quality, has a strong singular voice, and should hit right in the heart of the site\u2019s young, female demographic. It\u2019s a reminder that the future of cinema may not be in the movies but in that little screen you carry in your pocket (or pocketbook) every day. And that\u2019s the real skinny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
