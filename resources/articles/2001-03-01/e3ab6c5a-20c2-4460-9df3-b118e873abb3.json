In coming from behind to defeat a seemingly doomed Bradford yesterday George Burley's side climbed back into third spot and remain on course for a place in Europe. Today Bradford, tomorrow Barcelona. This victory was reward not just for Ipswich's dominance but for their patience. Refusing to abandon their passing principles after they undeservedly fell behind to Benito Carbone's free-kick, they were rewarded with two fine strikes from Martijn Reuser and a header from Mark Burchill in 15 second-half minutes. Burley refuses to talk of the club making it into Europe for the first time since 1983 but the chances of that fantasy becoming reality look promising. Of 10 remaining matches only one is against a current top-seven side, Liverpool. After a recent splutter of three straight league defeats Ipswich seem to have recovered form at the right time. \"They say the league never lies,\" Burley said. \"We're in third position on merit, knowing we have some very tough games coming up. We have enjoyed being in the top six. It's virtually the same squad that got us promotion. There have been one or two additions but it shows it's very much teamwork and effort.\" It is a tribute to Burley's coaching too, of course, and to his eye for a player. Hermann Hreidarsson, who arrived from Wimbledon in the close season, was again impressive. But it was Reuser, who spent the end of last season on loan from Vitesse Arnhem and signed in the summer for \u00a31m, who caught the eye. This was only the Dutchman's third Premiership start but it is hard to see him being dropped now. Having not found the net since last season's play-off final against Barnsley, he scored two fine goals, the second a 20-yard free-kick. \"I'm pleased for Martijn,\" Burley said. \"He's a very talented player. There's no doubt when you come from abroad it takes time to adapt to the pace of the game. I had a chat with him on Friday and said he had to work harder and show more. He certainly did that.\" Bradford, who denied Ipswich promotion on the last day of the 1998-1999 season, operate on a similar budget, yet their time in the Premiership has been one long struggle. Thirteen adrift of safety, they know their time is all but up. Their manager Jim Jefferies talked of \"if the inevitable happens\". For all Bradford's hard work, the gulf in quality was appreciable and Jefferies knows he must cut the wage bill and rebuild an ageing squad. \"I can't fault them for effort,\" he said. \"What they need to play at Premiership level they have not got: the ability and legs.\" Ipswich have both, yet Bradford had gone ahead with their first shot on target in the 27th minute. Eoin Jess tapped the ball aside and Carbone, making only his second start of the year after being among those told they could leave by Jefferies in January, beat Richard Wright from 30 yards. Had Carbone not failed, stretching from three yards, at 1-1 the outcome might have been different but Ipswich deserved their win. Having gone close several times, they equalised on the hour. Reuser intercepted Andy O'Brien's misplaced pass on the left flank and beat the same player inside the area before curling a perfect shot beyond Gary Walsh. When a Hreidarsson run was stopped illegally by Ashley Ward near the edge of the box, Reuser sent his free-kick beyond Walsh. The Dutchman also sent over the corner from which Hreidarsson's header was glanced in by Burchill. Hreidarsson, apparently thinking he had scored, dived into the crowd. \"I hope the people in the crowd are still alive because he's such a big bloke,\" Reuser said. Bradford's hopes of staying up look dead. For Ipswich the European dream lives on. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
