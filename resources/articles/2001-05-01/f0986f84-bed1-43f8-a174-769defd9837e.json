It had been widely expected that the Bank of England would bring rates down further since it cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February to 5.75% and then by a further quarter to 5.5% at the beginning of April. Before this, the base rate had remained at a steady 6% for a year - the longest time in more than 30 years that the base rate has been so low for such a sustained period. But while a further fall in interest rates may be welcome news for borrowers, it will not be greeted with such enthusiasm by savers. Rates on savings accounts are likely to fall to an all-time low. At present, the average net interest rate on a 90-day notice account with a balance of \u00a35,000 is 2.98%. The only time it has been lower than this in the past 20 years was two years ago when it fell to 2.50% when the base rate was at 5.25%. The volatile stock market climate has left many people increasingly reliant on income from savings. But following the cut in the base rate on April 5, virtually all banks and building societies slashed the interest rate on their savings accounts, many by further than the 0.25% base rate cut. Nationwide, for example, came under strong criticism for cutting one of the market leading rates on its e-savings account by 0.4% to 5.9%. But while Nationwide may have disappointed its customers, its internet account still offers a much better rate compared with some of its branch-based rivals. Most of the major high-street banks are paying a paltry 0.1% interest on current accounts and these banks, at least, are going to be hard pressed to reduce rates further. For some time savers have been advised to look around for a better deal on their accounts if they are being paid such low rates and, with internet banks paying rates as high as 7.25% last year, they were hardly pushed to find a better deal. But the last rate cut was evidence that even the newer institutions are feeling the pinch, with rates coming down on savings accounts, current accounts and individual savings accounts (ISAs) offered by the internet and phone banks. The consolation for savers is that, although rates are falling, in the current period of low inflation at 2.3%, even with an account paying only 5%, they will still be getting a real return of 2.7%. Following the last base rate cut in April, along with savings rates, virtually all banks cut their mortgage rates, thereby passing on the benefits to borrowers. As lenders tend to react immediately to base rate cuts, new borrowers will be the first to gain again this time round. This will be particularly welcome news for first-time buyers struggling to get a foot on the increasingly expensive property ladder. Existing borrowers are also likely to see their mortgage repayments fall from the beginning of next month, freeing up extra cash to pile into savings - for what it's worth.
