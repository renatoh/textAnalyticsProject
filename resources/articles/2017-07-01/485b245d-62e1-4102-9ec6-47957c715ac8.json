Top stories Any loan the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility gives to Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine project would likely be unlawful, says the former head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which operated under an almost identical mandate. Oliver Yates says the $1bn Adani loan, which has been given conditional approval, should never have progressed past the initial inspection by the Naif board, since it does not pass the reputation test. Like the CEFC, the Naif operates under an investment mandate that includes a clause saying it \u201cmust not act in a way that is likely to cause damage to the commonwealth government\u2019s reputation, or that of a relevant state or territory government\u201d. Yates told the Guardian: \u201cIt is beyond my understanding how the board of Naif can conclude that providing a subsidised loan to facilitate a project of this nature is \u2018not in a way likely to cause damage to the commonwealth government\u2019s reputation\u2019.\u201d The fallout from revelations in the Guardian that Australians\u2019 Medicare card details were being sold on the darknet continues. The ATO has issued and withdrawn an order that Medicare cards should not be accepted as proof of identification. An internal memo circulated to ATO staff on Wednesday said: \u201cAs a result of recent media coverage on Medicare card details being sold on the \u2018dark web\u2019, the Medicare card has been removed from the list of DVS (document verification service) documents until further notice.\u201d The memo was withdrawn a few hours later and staff were told a communique would be issued in coming days. The move signals confusion within the government on how to deal with the potential security breach. US investigators are exploring if Donald Trump\u2019s camp has any links to fake news stories pumped out of Russia during last year\u2019s election. Thousands of fake news stories that tried to implicate Hillary Clinton in murder or paedophilia have been traced back to Russia or eastern Europe by investigators. The head of the Trump digital camp, Brad Parscale, has reportedly been summoned to appear before the House intelligence committee, while Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, has said there were at least 1,000 \u201cpaid internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia\u201d. Warner also said there was evidence fake news stories had targeted key swing states, raising the possibility of co-ordination with US political operatives. Four Venezuelan politicians have been wounded after pro-government militias wielding wooden sticks and metal bars stormed the opposition-controlled Congress during a special session to mark the country\u2019s independence day. The attack comes amid three months of often-violent confrontations between security forces and protesters who accuse the government of trying to establish a dictatorship by jailing foes, pushing aside the opposition-controlled legislature and rewriting the constitution to avoid fair elections. Canberra has its fair share of honey-tongued politicians but parliament is about to produce its very own sweet treat. Three beehives have been installed in the grounds around Australia\u2019s Parliament House in Canberra to produce honey for sale in the shop and to give to visiting dignitaries. Just call it the diplomacy \u201cplan bee\u201d. Sport Australia has beaten Pakistan by 159 runs at the Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup, consolidating their position as favourites to take out the competition. Australia\u2019s powerful death-batting and tight new-ball bowling did the job against a disappointingly timid Pakistan. There\u2019s something a bit different this week from our resident football cartoonist, David Squires, as he turns his hand to cricket and the bitter pay dispute that is threatening to derail the game in Australia. Ali Fahour has stood down from his job as AFL diversity manager after being handed a 14-week suspension by his local football league for punching an opponent, triggering a lifetime ban from the sport. The sanction was handed down to Fahour after a two-and-a-half hour Northern Football League tribunal on Wednesday night. Thinking time Why? It\u2019s the obvious question that may immediately enter a casual observer\u2019s mind after seeing a streaker careen on to a sports field, legs pumping, flesh wobbling and bits dangling. Sport editor Mike Hytner approached one \u201cmid-level\u201d streaker to ask that very question.\u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating,\u201d said James. \u201cFor the first moment or two when you get on and you can hear the roar of the crowd. You can hear the laughter on the sidelines \u2013 whether they\u2019re laughing with you or at you \u2013 but in all cases it\u2019s just good fun.\u201d Simple food can be delicious, writes the Guardian\u2019s Felicity Cloake, after celebrity chef Nigella Lawson was mercilessly mocked online for sharing a recipe of tomatoes, chives and dressing. Cloake\u2019s favourite simple eats? Hot buttered toast, strawberries and cream, rice and dal, and, yes \u2013 a dressed, ripe tomato. Ian the Climate Denialist Potato has invited Bethany the intern to speak to his new coffee shop franchisees. But does he know she\u2019s in the union? First Dog on the Moon captures what happens next. What\u2019s he done now? Trump is yet to apologise for tweeting the now infamous CNN-wrestling video but the Reddit user who created the gif \u2013 HanAssholeSolo \u2013 says he regrets creating the image, and for making a series of racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic posts. \u201cI had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the president\u2019s Twitter feed,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.\u201d It is still unclear how the president discovered HanAssholeSolo\u2019s post. The White House did not respond to requests for comment but the revelations about HanAssholeSolo\u2019s past added to questions about the president\u2019s internet use and sourcing. Media roundup The police investigation into alleged NRL corruption has expanded with fresh claims of spot fixing, money laundering and more illegal salary cap payments, the Daily Telegraph reports. The West Australian reports that more than 300 WA truck drivers have had their licences suspended after claims they weren\u2019t properly assessed and the ABC reports that vacancies for mining jobs are up 70% from this time last year as activity and commodity prices across the resources sector ramp up. Coming up Vice admiral David Johnston will be providing a defence update on current Australian operations. Queensland will be throwing a tickertape parade for new hometown hero Jeff Horn, who is still celebrating his shock (and possibly shortlived) win over Manny Pacquiao on Sunday.
