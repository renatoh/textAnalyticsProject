Within hours the video, posted by the Democratic frontrunner on Wednesday evening, amassed close to 2m views, and more than 21,000 retweets. By comparison, Trump\u2019s video about his Nato trip had 1.4 million views and 14,600 retweets in the space of 12 hours. In a move to position himself as more respected by world leaders than the current commander-in-chief, Biden\u2019s minute-long video plays through the recent incident at Buckingham Palace, Trump being laughed at during a speech at the United Nations general assembly and interactions with leaders such as Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. \u201cThe world sees Trump for what he is,\u201d Biden says in the video. \u201cInsincere, ill-informed, corrupt, dangerously incompetent, and incapable in my view of world leadership.\u201d \u201cAnd if we give Donald Trump four more years, we will have great difficulty of ever being able to recover America\u2019s standing in the world, and our capacity to bring nations together.\u201d It ends with the written message: \u201cWe need a leader the world respects.\u201d CNN reported Biden\u2019s video was posted 30 minutes after Trump landed back on US soil, in keeping with Biden\u2019s policy of not criticising the president while he is overseas. Tuesday\u2019s hot-mic moment featured UK prime minister Boris Johnson, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Macron, and Princess Anne in conversation about Trump\u2019s lengthy press conferences. A furious Trump cut short his attendance at the summit after the footage emerged, and accused Trudeau of being \u201ctwo-faced\u201d. Trump later tweeted that \u201cI got along great with the Nato leaders\u201d and accused the \u201cfake news media\u201d was trying to \u201cbelittle my very successful trip to London for Nato\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
