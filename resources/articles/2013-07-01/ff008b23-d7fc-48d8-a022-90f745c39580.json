The retailer said it would invest more than \u00a31m in the shop, which will combine \"the best of home, fashion, gifting and seasonal ranges\" and forms part of its strategy to increase its international customer base. The new terminal 2 is eventually expected to serve 20 million passengers a year, with an average of 55,000 expected to pass through daily once it is in full operation. Andy Street, John Lewis's managing director, said the 334sq-metre (3,600 sq ft) Heathrow shop would give the firm access to \"one of the most concentrated, valuable and influential markets in the world\". An average full-line John Lewis department store is 12,200 square metres. The plans include the creation of around 40 jobs. The company will use the experience gained at Heathrow to determine whether there is potential to open similar stores at other airports and transport hubs. \"This is our first and we want to learn from it,\" said Sean Allam, commercial operations director at John Lewis. \"We are looking at a number of routes to get John Lewis out to international customers, and airports provide a unique opportunity because of the scale. We will have a look a year or so after to see whether there is a commercial proposition.\" He said the products on offer at Heathrow would predominantly be John Lewis's own brand, reversing its traditional store mix. The retailer currently delivers to 33 countries outside the UK and Ireland, representing 72% of terminal 2 destinations. It has a number of other new UK stores in the pipeline, including in Birmingham, Leeds, Oxford and York. Heathrow's terminal 2 will have a total of 67 outlets including shops, bars and restaurants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
