The national side received a fillip in the shape of Lewis Moody's return here, almost without hiccup, and a two\u2011try display of touch and power from Matt Banahan, playing at inside centre. Bath are demonstrating quite a penchant for Twickenham. This six-try win was an improvement even on the dazzling four\u2011try win they recorded over Wasps at the same venue this time last year. Tom Biggs, a pocketful of gunpowder, scored a hat\u2011trick of tries by half\u2011time. He played a blinder, prompting some to talk in terms of a late bid for the England squad. That may be a long shot but Banahan, somewhat larger, is all but certain to be in the World Cup squad. His second try racked up a 36-3 lead in the third quarter. Besides his usual qualities, he showed that as a pivot in midfield he could bring others on to the ball with some facility. \"I would have thought Martin Johnson will be delighted that he has an out-and-out winger who can play in the centre,\" said Sir Ian McGeechan. Nick Abendanon thrived in the wide open space and Michael Claassens may not be English but his string-pulling was a joy to watch. Moody, the England captain, was making his latest comeback from injury. He retired as planned after 48 minutes. He had, though, taken a knock to his gluteus maximus but will be fit for their trip to Newcastle this weekend. If Bath win that and the return at the Recreation Ground in the last round, with bonus points, they will have an outside chance of making the play-offs. Wasps' interest in the season, however, is over. They used to be the ones who had the penchant for playing at Twickenham, but this was a manner of defeat it would be hard to imagine Lawrence Dallaglio et al countenancing. They were woeful. \"I feel sorry for those supporters who have seen this happen two years now,\" said Leon Holden, Wasps' acting director of rugby. \"I feel sorry for the supporters who are new to rugby union. OK, they might have seen one side play well but the whole point of this exercise is to see us play well. They didn't see that.\" Last season Wasps attracted 60,000 to this fixture; this time the attendance was less than 40,000. Their deal with Twickenham for St George's Day fixtures has another year to run. They will have to put in one hell of a performance at next year's event if the arrangement is to be deemed a success. Nevertheless their team selection on Saturday may prove even more relevant to England's future than Bath's does, notable as it was for the three exceptionally young Englishmen they fielded. Two of them, Elliot Daly, a centre playing at full-back, and Billy Vunipola, a No8 of nearly 20 stone, are 18 and still at school. The third, Joe Launchbury, is 20 and plays in the second row. Simon Shaw is old enough to be his father, as are Danny Grewcock and Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe, his opponents, yet he was one of Wasps' better players. \"He'll play for England,\" said Holden. \"Physically, he's there, and his composure off the field is top notch. All three of them are very impressive young men. I've coached schoolboys in New Zealand since the late 90s and all three are right up there for their attitude off the field. If you haven't got that as a young guy, it doesn't matter how talented you are, you're not going to make the big time.\" A little further down the track to the big time is Joe Simpson, who scored a brilliant solo try for Wasps midway through the second half. There is life at Wasps, but just now they are caught between the past and future.
