It is just another drab pharmacist run by the Superdrug chain. But in 1929, local legend has it that this is where Jack Cohen opened the first ever Tesco store, and from these humble north London beginnings the story was born a giant retail empire that many now fear is destroying the traditional British high street. Tesco moved out of Watling Avenue years ago to set up a larger store round the corner. \"We drove them out,\" joked a local newsagent who doesn't want to be named. The truth though is that local retailers are feeling the pinch from Tesco and the other big supermarkets. John Doneo, runs a florist called Black and Cook on Watling Avenue. \"I can beat Tesco every time on price and I've got much more variety, but where they've got you is the big exposure. People think Tesco is cheaper because of the advertising,\" he said. \"They've also got the parking and the convenience factor. It's easier for people for to drive to a supermarket get a paper, some milk, 20 fags, and a bunch of flowers.\" Black and Cook was established in 1938, just a few years after Tesco. Mr Doneo's mother can remember Jack Cohen's daughter, the future Dame Shirley Porter, as a schoolgirl in the area, but he's got no affection for the chain. \"When was the last time you got a discount from Tesco for buying a load of shopping there?\" he asked. For now business at the florist is good. It has 13 full and part time employees. But Mr Doneo's traditional customers are dying off - one of the mainstays of the florist is funeral bouquets. Over the last decades, scores of traditional local shops have been forced out of Watling Avenue. It's a familiar pattern that led a group of MPs to warn this week that we have 10 years left to save the high street. They called for small shops to be protected against supermarket giants to help maintain the vibrancy of local streets and choice for consumers. It warned that without such protection, minority groups such as Muslims would lose out because they rely on local shops for halal meat. In Watling Avenue there are several grocers who sell halal meat. \"We are targeting Asians, Tesco is looking to the Europeans. We sell \u00a3500 worth of halal meat every day. We are not in danger of going out of business,\" said Mohan, who works in one of the stores. The problem for Mr Doneo is that those buying halal meat don't tend to buy his flowers. \"Now that the population has changed there's not such a culture of buying flowers. I used to take over a thousand pounds just selling spring flowers,\" he said. Other stores in the area have been better able to adapt to Burnt Oak's changing population. Doneo introduces Dee Georgemichaels who with her husband runs Edgware Fisheries, one of the best-stocked fishmongers you will ever see. \"At Christmas they got in a load of carp for all the Polish people in the area. You wouldn't see Tesco doing that,\" Mr Doneo said. Ms Georgemichaels rattles off how much more variety her store offers compared with Tesco. \"They don't do lobsters, they don't do scallops. We also do shark and barracuda, they've got none of that. They just buy in bulk, but we're down the fish market every day. On Valentine's Day we sold 20 boxes of Scotch oysters.\" But both Mr Doneo and Ms Georgemichaels are gloomy about the long-term future. \"They'll win in the end. We'll all close down and they'll be less variety for customers.\" Tesco says that it is an exaggeration to claim that local shops are in terminal decline. \"There is room in a thriving market for anyone who satisfied customers,\" a spokeswoman said. Some customers aren't so sure. In Norwich there is growing support for a campaign to stop Tesco opening a store in the city's Unthank Road. It's the centre of a busy, old-fashioned shopping district full of independent stores including delicatessens, a bakery, a butcher and a shop that doubles as a greengrocers and fishmongers. Campaigners say there is a \"village feel\" here that would be threatened by a new Tesco. A petition against the store has been signed by 5,000 people. The campaign is up against a formidable foe. Tesco is in the midst of an aggressive bid to get its store built. Its original planning application was accompanied by a photocopy of a similar application in another part of the country that was originally refused but later overturned at a planning appeal. Undaunted, the city council's planning committee rejected the application. Tesco has taken the matter to appeal, which will be heard later this year. In the meantime it has submitted another application that includes the added amenity for the council of two flats above the store. \"They just keep putting in applications in the hope that people resisting will lose motivation,\" said Bridget Barnes of the Stop Unthank Tesco campaign. It's a familiar tactic. According to a report last month by Friends of the Earth, Tesco is \"bulldozing\" its way through the planning system by intimidating councils with the threat of expensive appeals if they refuse new stores, and at the same time as offering community perks if they agree. Tesco denies this and insists its stores can only benefit local communities, but campaigners are joining forces for the first time to do battle with the retail giant. A movement called Tescopoly, an alliance that includes Friends of the Earth, the New Economics Foundation and War on Want, wants to stop Britain becoming a \"one-supermarket state\". Its website, for which the motto is \"every little hurts\", has a new feature to create a network of local opposition to Tesco. Here campaigners share tips on how to take on the company. \"Tescopoly means that local groups can talk to one another, which in turn builds a stronger, more united and ultimately more effective movement against supermarket expansion,\" said Chris Hull, one of the Norwich campaigners. In a statement Tesco said: \"We respect people's right to their opinion and try hard to engage with such groups so that we can explain the benefits Tesco brings to communities.\" Many people still need a lot of convincing. As Barnes said: \"We don't want a clone town Britain, where we are forced to use one supermarket because there are no local shops left.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
