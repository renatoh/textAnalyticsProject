After all, what hope could there ever be for an unheralded defender from one of the Premier League\u2019s more direct teams when Southgate has cast Manchester United\u2019s Chris Smalling into the international wilderness because he is not good enough on the ball? Appearances can be deceptive, however, because while the focus for Tarkowski has been on getting the basics right this season, he possesses a pedigree as a passer. \u201cMaybe some of you have written that I\u2019m an old-fashioned English defender but before I joined Burnley no one ever said those words about me,\u201d the 25-year-old said at St George\u2019s Park. \u201cI was more a ball-playing centre-half, playing out from the back in a Brentford team that took a lot of chances.\u201d That willingness to throw caution to the wind worked against Tarkowski when he joined Burnley in 2016. Sean Dyche had a different philosophy. He wanted his new signing to improve at the ugly side of the game and Tarkowski spent last season below Michael Keane in the pecking order. \u201cWhen I went to Burnley it sort of flipped it on its head,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take a lot less chances but do the basics right. That has really brought my game on, keeping it quite simple at times but doing the defending \u2013 the most important stuff \u2013 right.\u201d Having worked tirelessly to adapt to Dyche\u2019s ethos in training, Tarkowski was ready to step up when Keane joined Everton last summer. The Burnley manager had quietly advised him that Keane was probably going to leave and Tarkowski, who also qualifies for Poland through his paternal grandfather, has seized his opportunity to impress this season, playing a pivotal role in Burnley\u2019s rise to seventh place in the Premier League. Keane has fallen out of contention after flailing at Everton this season, but understanding Tarkowski\u2019s appeal to Southgate requires looking beyond Burnley having the fourth best defensive record in the Premier League. Southgate, who watched him play in the Championship for Brentford, likes centre-backs with technical ability. He has favoured Leicester\u2019s Harry Maguire over Smalling and dropped Chelsea\u2019s Gary Cahill for the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy. Those tough calls have left England looking short of stature and experience at the back. There is no one of the calibre of Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand or John Terry in this squad and although England kept clean sheets after switching to a back three for the November friendlies against Germany and Brazil, it is difficult not to suspect that defensive vulnerabilities could undermine them at the World Cup. Swansea\u2019s Alfie Mawson and Liverpool\u2019s Joe Gomez are promising but raw, Manchester City\u2019s John Stones still has much to prove at the highest level and Eric Dier has played only a handful of games in defence for Tottenham this season. Ryan Bertrand also pulled out of the squad on Tuesday with a back injury. Yet at least Southgate has a clear idea of how he wants his team to play. \u201cThe game\u2019s changed,\u201d Tarkowski said. \u201cThat Barcelona team made everyone think: \u2018This is the way football\u2019s got to be now,\u2019 so everyone went to 4-3-3 and opened the pitch up as much as they could. Striking the right balance will be crucial. \u201cSergio Ramos, people might say he\u2019s a ball-playing centre half, but he still does the dirty stuff right,\u201d Tarkowski said. \u201cHe sticks his head in when he needs to. He\u2019s scored a lot of big goals for Real Madrid, putting his head in the box and getting on the end of crosses. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be adaptable to any kind of style of play. If you\u2019re just sticking with one way, you can only end up playing under certain managers. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve got both sides of my game. Especially after being at Burnley for a few years. And I know the manager has seen me at Brentford, where I\u2019ve played that kind of style, so he obviously knows what I\u2019m capable of. Hopefully I can adapt to that and fit straight in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
