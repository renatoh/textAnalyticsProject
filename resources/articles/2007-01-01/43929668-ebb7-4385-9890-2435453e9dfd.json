As the US exchange's \u00a32.7bn bid enters a crucial 72 hour phase, the American bidder said the LSE had \"completely failed to engage with Nasdaq\" while the LSE insisted that the US exchange had made no attempt to talk since launching its \u00a312.43 a share offer in November. Nasdaq has made it clear it will not negotiate with the LSE beyond Friday - even though the bid technically runs until February 10 - to encourage shareholders to force the LSE chief executive Clara Furse to the negotiating table. Any talks look unlikely and some investors believe the LSE management will settle for nothing less than \u00a314. The LSE's shares are trading above the \u00a312.43 offer price and investors continue to build their stakes above this price, including US corporate raider Samuel Heyman. Yesterday he raised his stake to 10.35% from the 10.3% he declared last week. The LSE shares fell 10p to \u00a313.06. In its second appeal to LSE shareholders, Nasdaq yesterday asserted that the LSE's defence is not strong enough to prevent the shares falling below the crucial \u00a312.43 a share level. As Nasdaq chief executive, Bob Greifeld, flew to Davos rather than discuss the offer with LSE shareholders, the LSE chairman Chris Gibson-Smith insisted that the US market was trying to buy the London exchange \"on the cheap\". \"The board firmly believes that Nasdaq's offer does not even give standalone value. The board will continue to defend steadfastly shareholders' interests and we await any indication from Nasdaq regarding an offer price that the board could recommend to shareholders. It is time for Nasdaq to shut up or put up,\" Mr Gibson-Smith said. Nasdaq retorted that it had done so on the morning of November 20 when it formally launched its bid. Nasdaq said: \"LSE to this day completely refuses to engage with Nasdaq. Nothing in LSE's behaviour suggests they have any real interest in taking part in a dialogue which could lead to a recommended offer for the company.\" Nasdaq owns more than 28% of the LSE and only needs to convince 21% of shareholders if it is to reach its goal of owning just over 50% of the shares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
