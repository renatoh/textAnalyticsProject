Prior to Ogbonna\u2019s header 10 minutes from time which consigned Leeds to another home defeat, you felt as though a combination of profligacy from the visitors and the heroics of Illan Meslier would leave West Ham heading back to London with just a point, rather than the three which ultimately moved them up to fifth before the rest of the weekend\u2019s action. But this West Ham side, who continue to show promising signs under David Moyes, are nothing if not determined. Even after Ogbonna\u2019s winner, it was the visitors who pressed for another goal, as opposed to Leeds scrambling for an equaliser which, on the balance of play, they arguably would not have deserved given the dominance of their opponents. Leeds have obvious frailties at the back, underlined not only by both West Ham goals coming from set pieces, but the fact that only West Bromwich Albion have conceded more goals than Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side this season. However, the sheer litany of chances West Ham created emphasised that they are moving in the right direction this season. But how far can they go? \u201cWell, I can only talk about what we\u2019ve done up to now,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cWe were good after lockdown but we\u2019ve improved again. This game, playing Leeds, is different to any other you face in the league but we were good. We had good chances to get even further in front.\u201d You always felt that Leeds, more than other sides, would suffer with some semblance of behind-closed-doors fatigue in this campaign. That is reflected in their home form since promotion, with only one victory and just five points from their first six home games this season. Here, they can have no complaints about the manner of their latest defeat. The promise with which they started, which led to Mateusz Klich\u2019s retaken penalty giving them the lead following a Lukasz Fabianski foul on Patrick Bamford, quickly faded. Enforced defensive shuffles have been an all-too-frustrating familiarity for Leeds this season, and they were forced into another here, with Luke Ayling deputising at centre-back for the injured Robin Koch. But almost half of Leeds\u2019 goals conceded under Bielsa have come from set pieces, and those old habits came back to haunt them once again. Jarrod Bowen\u2019s cross was met by Tomas Soucek, and while Meslier should have done better in preventing the Czech midfielder from scoring his third in four games, he was crucial in keeping Leeds in the game thereafter. But despite a string of missed opportunities, several of them falling to S\u00e9bastien Haller, it was another dead-ball, delivered by Aaron Cresswell and finished by Ogbonna, which was decisive. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is not exclusive,\u201d Bielsa insisted. \u201cThis problem we\u2019re having, we\u2019ve had in the past before, resolved it and now it\u2019s happening again. There are no mysteries to the things we have to do.\u201d Not even a tactical reshuffle after half-time, with Bielsa changing his entire left side and introducing Jamie Shackleton and H\u00e9lder Costa, stunted West Ham\u2019s dominance. Bamford fired narrowly wide after the restart, but it was soon the visitors who enjoyed the majority of the opportunities. Bowen found Haller unmarked in the six-yard box, but his shot was blocked by Ayling, before Pablo Fornals dragged narrowly wide and Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena was denied by a stunning one-handed save from Meslier, who looked as though he would atone for his earlier mistake and earn his side a much-needed point. But when Ogbonna outfoxed the Leeds defence, peeled back and headed into the top corner of Meslier\u2019s net, the home defenders slumped to their knees, knowing their achilles heel had struck again. As Leeds are starting to find out the hard way, there is no room for lapses of that magnitude in the Premier League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
