The report, tabled in the Queensland parliament on Tuesday, criticised the government for having no strategy or framework to manage threatened species. Its slew of criticisms included: Long delays by a succession of state ministers to act on recommendations to list threatened species. On average, ministers waited more than three years to approve a listing. A lack of information on some species to determine whether they are eligible for listing. Efforts to manage threatened species \u201clack purpose, direction and coordination\u201d. The state does no planning to determine where it should devote its resources to protect habitats, mitigate threats and reduce species decline. Its efforts are mostly reactive rather than addressing the common causes of threats. Ineffective engagement between the government, conservation groups and landholders. Incomplete monitoring and reporting of outcomes to mange threatened species. Failure to curb soaring deforestation rates and protect animal habitat. \u201cThe [Department of Environment and Science] previously developed a strategy which it never implemented,\u201d the audit found. \u201cBecause it has no strategy, its efforts in managing threatened species lack purpose, direction and coordination. The department has not determined its priorities, clear action areas or measurable targets for the recovery of threatened species and habitats.\u201d In one case, an unnamed species was listed as threatened more than seven years after it was assessed for the list. Once listed, species are not periodically reviewed and the department \u201cdoes not know whether the extinction risk for these species has changed or remained steady\u201d. \u201cDelays in listing result in delays in species protection,\u201d the report said. \u201cOverall, the [department\u2019s] response to conserving threatened species lacks cross-program coordination and is unlikely to effectively conserve and recover many threatened species. \u201cThis is because the department has not taken a strategic approach, and has no system to prioritise, coordinate and report on recovery activities, threatened species population trends and the effectiveness of conservation management.\u201d It said conservation groups and other stakeholders had expressed \u201cfrustration and disillusionment\u201d. The impact of land clearing on native species habitat led the government to pass new laws this year aimed at curbing soaring deforestation rates. The audit said the rates of clearing had accelerated the loss of habitat of more than 300 threatened flora and fauna species. \u201cBy 2015, 26% of remnant threatened fauna habitat and 35 per cent of remnant threatened flora habitat had been cleared statewide,\u201d the report said. The World Wide Fund for Nature has listed eastern Australia as a \u201cdeforestation front\u201d, mainly because of the rates of clearing in Queensland. The Wilderness Society said the findings pointed to a need for a national approach to conservation and to halt deforestation. \u201cAustralia needs new effective environment laws and an independent environment watchdog to stop such environmental devastation happening and from threatened species going extinct,\u201d said the Wilderness Society\u2019s Queensland campaign manager, Gemma Plesman. \u201cThe Queensland government recently reintroduced laws to curb deforestation and habitat destruction but unfortunately these laws do not go far enough to fully protect threatened species like the koala, which is vulnerable to extinction.\u201d \u201cYou can still drive bulldozers through threatened-species habitat with little to no oversight. If anything the listing of a species is a death warrant because once a species go on they rarely, if ever, improve. \u201cThe solution is simple: we need urgent action from our state government and real leadership from our federal government.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
