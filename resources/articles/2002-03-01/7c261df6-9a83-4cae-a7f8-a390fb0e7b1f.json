He was talking about Igor Stepanovs but his phrase was applicable to more than just the increasingly convincing Latvian centre-half. There was this sometimes confusing, if highly entertaining, match to consider, and its replay a week on Saturday. Also, how Arsenal and Newcastle United will play out their season. There is nothing definite about any of it: the beauty is that it is in the hands of the beholders. A draw solved nothing. For Arsenal it means another 90 minutes of intense activity in a schedule they hope will become ever more crowded and demanding; for Newcastle it brought a recovery of esteem after the previous weekend's defeat by the Gunners and last Wednesday's at Anfield. \"We haven't lost to a good team,\" said Bobby Robson, and you knew what he meant. That 3-0 defeat by Liverpool was only the second time this season that Newcastle had lost consecutive games, and their manager was anxious for it not to become three. Nevertheless Robson was downcast as he swapped seats with Wenger, but he will hope Newcastle can win again in the league next weekend against Ipswich Town, and then look at Arsenal fresh in the Cup. Robson said Gary Speed and Kieron Dyer should be available to him by the time of the replay, maybe even Craig Bellamy, though that seemed optimistic. The prevailing feeling among Newcastle fans was that had Bellamy been alongside Alan Shearer rather than the clearly unfit Carl Cort, their team would have won. Rarely will Arsenal be pinned into their half in such a sustained manner, and even if Richard Wright was not forced into a series of saves, Newcastle thought that this was their moment. That sentiment grew when Robson saw the Arsenal teamsheet, he said. No David Seaman, Dennis Bergkamp or Robert Pires in the starting line-up, and no Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole, Oleg Luzhny, Tony Adams and a certain Thierry Henry on the bus. Wenger was in a similar situation to Robson as he ticked off the names of those who might return for the return. Henry will still be suspended - which means he misses only one Premiership match, a plus for Arsenal - but Parlour and Cole should be back. Home advantage should also work for them, though caveats exist. However, Arsenal will be expected to progress and that will necessitate a change in their Manchester United fixture at Old Trafford, scheduled for Cup semi-final weekend. That potential title knockout confrontation is likely to move to the Wednesday of the last week of the season. The Cup final will be over by then but definite judgments may still be difficult. One thing Arsenal will know is where they are in Europe. Tomorrow night at Highbury they face Deportivo La Coruna in a huge Champions League game. The following Wednesday they go to Turin to meet Juventus in another. Wenger said Deportivo could have been lurking in Arsenal's \"subconscious\" here, and one does not need to be Inspector Morse to detect that those European fixtures might matter a bit more to Wenger than the FA Cup. That said, teamsheet and all, Arsenal wanted to win this match. At times Wenger and Pat Rice raged in the dug-out, and had Shay Given not won a 50-50 challenge with Sylvain Wiltord midway through the second half, Arsenal may have done so. When Edu had given Arsenal a 14th-minute lead it felt as if that was about to happen. Sylvain Distin and Nikos Dabizas were guilty of poor defending as Edu stabbed in Wiltord's cross. But with young Jamie McClen and the hitherto uninspiring Clarence Acuna battling successfully against Patrick Vieira - \"he's a monster,\" said Robson admiringly - Newcastle fought back and earned a deserved equaliser through Laurent Robert six minutes after half-time. Robert had struck the cross bar earlier when he should have scored - and Lee Dixon also cleared a Distin header off the line as Newcastle surged on a tide of noisy support - but when he ran on to Shearer's flick Robert made amends for several disdainful displays with a fine right-foot shot that Wright may wish to look at again. Robert made a greater contribution all-round than usual, the result of a long good Friday spent with Robson. There was a rush to acclaim the Frenchman when he arrived last summer but at \u00a310m Robson wants more than a few decent crosses. \"I spent some considerable time with him,\" said Robson. \"You can see what he does when he's focused. We know he can play like that - he's just got to give it to us. He's a big player playing for a big club with a big audience.\" It now awaits the replay. Nervously.
