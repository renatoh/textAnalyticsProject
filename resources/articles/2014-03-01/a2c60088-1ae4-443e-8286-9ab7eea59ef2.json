But it may yet very well end up in the fire. When he was appointed only nine months ago, Mr Sutherland's appeal was that he knew how to run big retail. He came from B&amp;Q, and his remit, as he saw it, was to bring its plc management style to every aspect of the Co-op Group \u2013 ailing bank, loss-making supermarkets, farms, pharmacies, flower shops and all. But the point about the Co-op is that, unlike many businesses, it really is more than the sum of its parts: all the individual businesses and the people who work in them, their members and customers, make up something whose superficial resemblance to B&amp;Q is misleading. The Co-op's heart beats to a different rhythm. The challenge for Mr Sutherland was to recognise the difference and find a way to nurse its business model built on accountability from one that the Rochdale pioneers would recognise from the 18th century to a more viable place. Next week's miserable annual results will be a reminder of just how big the job is. Mr Sutherland, good as he is at business \u2013 the rescue package for the Co-op Bank was down to him \u2013 didn't get the co-op culture. The culture fought back, or so it would appear from the leak to the Observer, apparently from some regional directors appalled at the top team's jaw-dropping remuneration packages. His response, an angry 6am posting on Facebook denouncing the leakers, followed by the protracted resignation, suggest a man out of all sympathy with the organisation. No one would argue against the pressing need for a leaner, speedier system of governance at the top. There will be sympathy with his charge that the group's multi-tiered structure and its strong voluntary ethos leave it hard to manage. It does have to adapt or die. But it also has to remain recognisably the Co-op. At its roots, this was a fundamental cultural clash between the metropolitan Mr Sutherland and the Manchester-based group of provincial co-operatives. But the plan to double the executive pay bill to \u00a312m blew it apart. As Ed Mayo of Co-operatives UK points out, fair pay can be fair by outcome or fair by process. Hundreds of the biggest co-operatives world-wide, each with a turnover in excess of $100m, make some variation of the two work. There are global success stories among them, such as Spain's Mondragon, which felt the pain of the euro storm but survives with its democratic structure intact. The model is fine. It just doesn't work in the same way as a plc. Now they've won the fight, though, the defenders of the co-operative tradition in the group's senior management have a heavy burden themselves. Survival depends on making the tradition fit for the 21st century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
