Wearing a white T-shirt featuring the words \"Love of my life\", Symone Wilson said she and Duggan's family were concerned about the Independent Police Complaints Commission's (IPCC) ability to retain autonomy. Duggan was shot carrying a converted replica handgun by a CO19 firearms officer 10 days ago, after the vehicle he was in was stopped during an operation to arrest him. Initial reports suggested that the father-of-five opened fire at an officer. But on Friday, the IPCC admitted it might have \"inadvertently\" misled the media into believing Duggan shot at police. Speaking at an event to celebrate Duggan's life at Broadwater Farm Community Centre on Friday night, a few hours after the IPCC's admission, Wilson said: \"We put our faith in the IPCC but they have let us down. How can we now trust that they are independent of the police as they say they are? \"We want to know the truth about how Mark died and will not rest until that information is given to us.\" Wilson's sister, Michelle, who wore a T-shirt featuring the words \"Gone but never forgotten\", alleged that the family had been fed misleading information by the police watchdog. She said: \"The IPCC person told us one thing behind closed doors, once she eventually spoke with us days after the shooting, and then said something completely different in public. We have been treated appallingly by the IPCC.\" The Duggans are now calling for an independent inquiry to examine the relationship between Scotland Yard and police investigators. A family friend, who requested anonymity as he comforted the family at the home of Duggan's mother, Pamela, in Tottenham, yesterday said many in the community felt that the inquest had been scheduled for December in an attempt to defuse media interest. She confirmed that the family were seeking to commission an independent second postmortem because they could not trust the official version of events. The IPCC's alleged failure to keep the family informed was part of the reason why relatives protested outside the police station on Tottenham High Road last Saturday. For around four hours, the crowd waited for a senior officer to speak to them before a teenage girl was allegedly attacked by police after verbally abusing officers. Shortly afterward, a group peeled away and set fire to two police cars, the start of the riots that would sweep across England. The Duggans, who said yesterday it was not ready to comment in detail, also said that the volume of disinformation relating to the dead man had not been corrected by the authorities and that most of the allegations against him remained unsubstantiated. \"He was not a gang member and he had no criminal record. He was from a tightly knit group of friends who did separate things during the week and met up like childhood friends do, and yet some people are trying to describe that as a gang,\" said the friend. She said the Duggans settled in Tottenham more than 50 years ago and were an integral part of the community. Within the community, the reputation of the police and IPCC has dipped considerably after the shooting. One rumour doing the rounds in Tottenham yesterday involved reports that Duggan was initially laughing when confronted by CO19 officers. \"He didn't know the danger he was in,\" said the friend. Another rumour said that the vehicle in which he was stopped was towed away from the crime scene near Tottenham Hale station and then moved back. The family also expressed its anger at being \"hounded\" by the media. Duggan's children, said the friend, were in Manchester when Mark was killed and they had then been taken to Blackpool to shield them from attention. \"Mark was an amazing father, that's the thing he was known for \u2013 for being a dedicated dad. The biggest thing now is protecting his children,\" said the friend. Most of the flowers given to Duggan's mother are on display inside her home. But propped against a fence yesterday were nine large bouquets. One read: \"For a brother, a cousin, a friend and a dad, condolences to Mark and his family. Man still lives on. xxx\" The IPCC has previously stated that it is committed to ensuring the Duggans are provided with information, but that verifying those answers can be a lengthy process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
