Albion\u2019s centre-back was under the impression that the Premier League would be faster than the Bundesliga after leaving Mainz on a free transfer, although his observations about United\u2019s attacking approach probably revealed more about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s methods than the overall state of English football. It was a dismal effort from United and Balogun said the game would probably be played at a quicker pace when Brighton visit Anfield on Saturday. \u201cSome of the lads have just asked me that too and I said I had expected the Premier League to be quicker, but they told me this is always the kind of game you play against United,\u201d the Nigeria defender said. \u201cThey like to slow it down a little bit sometimes. Liverpool is going to be completely different. I know how [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp likes to play. It\u2019s going to be a lot quicker and a lot more intense.\u201d Brighton restricted United to three shots on target, one of which was Paul Pogba\u2019s consolation penalty, and Shane Duffy revealed they were happy to let Mourinho\u2019s side have the ball in unthreatening areas. \u201cWe know their strengths and we know we\u2019ve had good results and performances against them before,\u201d the Republic of Ireland centre-back said. \u201cWe know they\u2019ve got good, quick front players so we just had to match their runs and try to let them play in front of us. It worked and I think they got a little bit frustrated and that was the gameplan.\u201d Duffy\u2019s delight at scoring Brighton\u2019s second goal was matched by the way Chris Hughton\u2019s side adjusted to losing Lewis Dunk to an ankle injury in the 20th minute. Balogun, who played for his country at the World Cup finals in Russia, came on for his debut and formed an instant understanding with Duffy in central defence. \u201cHe\u2019s fitted straight in,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big character in the changing room. He\u2019s got a big voice. He\u2019s played with big players in big games. That\u2019s why you bring in players like that. They push us. He was great. That\u2019s another plus for us, that strength in depth with top players. You pick up injuries and suspensions so you need these kind of players to step in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
