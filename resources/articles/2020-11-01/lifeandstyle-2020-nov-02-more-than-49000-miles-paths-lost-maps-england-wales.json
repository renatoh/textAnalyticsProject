The walking charity established an online tool for the public to search historical maps for footpaths that were missing from the official maps that today record legal rights of way. Since February, thousands of volunteers have scoured 154,000 one-kilometre squares using the Ramblers\u2019 mapping site and found there are nearly five times as many missing paths as the initial estimate of 10,000 miles. More than a fifth of the lost paths \u2013 9,000 miles \u2013 are in south-west England, and Devon tops the list of counties with the most missing rights of way, with enough lost paths (2,949 miles) to take someone from Plymouth to beyond the north pole. The West Midlands has the highest density of lost paths to be potentially added to official maps. If all the missing paths were re-established as public rights of way it would increase the path network in England and Wales by up to a third. But as the search for missing rights of way continues, the Ramblers is warning that it is a race against time to get lost paths recognised by the authorities. The government has set a cutoff date of January 2026, after which it will no longer be possible to reclaim and safeguard lost rights of way. \u201cThe amazing response we had from the public to help us search for missing rights of way just goes to show what an important place our path network holds in the hearts of so many of us,\u201d said Jack Cornish, the programme manager for the Ramblers\u2019 Don\u2019t Lose Your Way campaign. \u201cAs we increasingly recognise the huge benefits of being able to easily get outdoors and access nature, saving these paths takes on an even greater urgency. With just five years to go, it\u2019s more important than ever to protect this precious asset for generations to come.\u201d The mapping effort is helping the Ramblers to start prioritising paths that would be the most useful additions to the official map, and gather the historical evidence to support applications to local authorities to have them reinstated as public rights of way. The charity has launched a crowdfunder to support its campaign. John Bainbridge, a path campaigner and Ramblers volunteer, said: \u201cI knew there were quite a lot of paths that weren\u2019t on the definitive map but I hadn\u2019t realised how many. We\u2019ve got to get out there, find the historic evidence for these paths, and save them. It\u2019s going to be a massive, massive job, and we really need as many people as possible to get involved, in whatever way they can.\u201d Once legally recorded as rights of way and added to the map the paths are protected in law for people to use and enjoy.
