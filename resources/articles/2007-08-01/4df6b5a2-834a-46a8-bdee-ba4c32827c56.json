Despite a calmer day on the markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling by 3.01, or 0.02%, to close at 13236.53, the credit crunch prompted by defaults on American home loans continued to reverberate around the world, and the volume of losses suffered by a segment of the hedge fund industry began to emerge. Goldman Sachs revealed that its Global Equity Opportunities (GEO) fund lost nearly a third of its value last week - a drop of some $1.8bn (\u00a3890m). Its deficit was due to so-called \"herd mentality\" as scores of computer-driven funds sparked each other in unwinding positions. Goldman is bailing its GEO fund out with $3bn, of which $1bn is from outside investors including the Californian billionaire Eli Broad, the New York fund Perry Capital, and CV Starr - a financial vehicle run by former AIG insurance chief Hank Greenberg. The bank's chief financial officer, David Viniar, objected to use of the term \"rescue\" and insisted that Goldman saw a valuable opportunity to invest in a vehicle whose valuation was \"way out of whack\" with its fundamental worth. \"Given the dislocation in the markets, we believe this is a good investment opportunity for us and for the investors we've brought in.\" The hedge fund is worst hit of three Goldman ventures sitting on huge write-offs. The others are the smaller North American Equity Fund, which is worth some $600m, and the Global Alpha fund, which is down by 27%. Problems have arisen with highly complex \"quantitative\" trading models under which a computer uses mathematical algorithms in picking stocks and in reacting to price movements. Hedge fund experts say the market has become crowded with such ventures, all of which have very similar portfolios. Last week, two or three such funds began to sell down their positions in \"household name\" companies. A source at one bank said: \"That had an entirely unexpected, unprecedented and incredibly fast reaction on the rest of the sector.\" Some have suggested that the incident has exposed a structural problem. Peter Morici, professor of finance at the University of Maryland, said: \"These hedge funds have become so large that they're becoming destabilising.\" He said funds needed to find arbitrage opportunities to make money which became increasingly scarce as the market gets more crowded. \"They all seem to come to the same conclusions - and that starts to drive prices in a direction that causes everybody else to trade,\" said Prof Morici. \"When you're small, you can find things and make money - but if everybody else is doing exactly the same, it becomes much more difficult.\" Market sentiment received a welcome boost from solid retail sales figures in America, which suggested that the tightening of mortgage credit is yet to slow consumers' spending habits. Retail sales were up by 0.3% in July, reversing a drop of 0.7% in June which had been the worst figure for 16 months. Included in the statistics was a 1% gain in electronics sales, partly down to enthusiasm for Apple's new iPhone. Richard Huber, an economist at AG Edwards in St Louis, said: \"Not only did the month of July come in a little stronger than expected, but June was revised upward to reflect less of a decline which will be good for the stock market.\" However, Canada's fifth largest bank, CIBC, provided a reminder of the root cause of recent slides in global markets by revealing that it was writing off C$290m (\u00a3137m) in mortgage-backed securities rendered virtually unsaleable by a slide in American property values which has left riskier home loans dangerously exposed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
