Imagine: you\u2019re sat round a table with 27 other reasonably important people, all of whom think you have done something unbelievably stupid and are now determined that you follow through with something unbelievably enormous, very soon. Your sole objective, meanwhile, is to do nothing whatsoever for as long as possible, while pretending you know what you want when actually you don\u2019t because it will be your unfortunate successor who decides. It can\u2019t have been pleasant. Afterwards of course, they all span it \u2013 to a point. \u201cThis is a sad night for me,\u201d said David Cameron, all stiff upper lip but plainly quite cut up. \u201cI will do everything I can to encourage close relations between Britain and the European Union.\u201d The atmosphere over dinner, declared German chancellor Angela Merkel, was \u201cone of camaraderie. But also ... sadness.\u201d Donald Tusk, the EU council president, insisted all had been \u201ccalm and pleasant\u201d. But underneath, it was pretty clear: Britain can have a few months to sort itself out, find a new PM, that kind of stuff, but then it needs to get a move on. There can be no going back, and there will be no special favours. Britain must be bonkers if it thinks it can have single market access without EU migration, said France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, bluntly. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had a dig at British Euroscepticism. Those who \u201cblame Brussels day after day, starting in the morning and finishing in the evening\u201d, he said, who bang on about \u201cBrussels being under the command of Eurocrats and technocrats\u201d, should maybe not be surprised if, at the end of the day, people believe them. It really can\u2019t have been an easy day. The first sighting of the sacrificial victim was in a corridor in the European commission\u2019s gargantuan Berlaymont building, talking animatedly, and to all appearances even amicably, with Juncker. The prime minister and the commission president posed for a brief photo, but did not speak. \u201cDo you regret doing this, prime minister?\u201d cried a voice from the depths of the media crowd. Answer came there none. Diving into the summit proper shortly after, Cameron declared, with commendable if misplaced optimism, that \u201cthese countries are our neighbours, our friends, our allies, our partners\u201d, and that he was looking for \u201cthe closest possible relationship\u201d. Good luck with that one, prime minister. Among others early to the party, German chancellor Angela Merkel blinked, wagged her finger \u2013 the one she pulls the strings with \u2013 and reminded everyone it was important to still see Britain \u201cas a friend\u201d. Good luck with that one, chancellor. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said the union had no time to lose. \u201cEurope,\u201d the French president insisted, \u201ccontinues. History doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d But since his story, as the least popular leader France has ever had, will very definitely stop about this time next year when he faces a very nasty-looking election, nobody took much notice. Pretty much every other leader said, in actually rather a British kind of way, that London just needed to jolly well get a move on, please, because this really was not good enough. The Luxembourg prime minister, Xavier Bettel, made it plain for the digital age. \u201cWe are not on Facebook, where things are complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are married or divorced. Not something in between.\u201d Britain did, though, find an unlikely ally in the fiery Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, himself no stranger to bitter and protracted face-offs with the beasts of Brussels. Tsipras said this whole thing was thoroughly predictable, because Europe was thoroughly undemocratic. The EU, he said, needs to \u201creplace austerity with growth, division with convergence, unemployment with decent jobs and endless negotiations behind closed doors with transparency and democracy\u201d. Good luck with that one, prime minister. Donald Tusk, the council president who is chairing the summit, did, though, say he was planning a special meeting of the EU leaders \u2013 without Cameron, clearly \u2013 in Bratislava in September, to chart a path through the wreckage. And Germany, France and Italy came up with something lengthy in a royal blue folder about boosting EU cooperation on security and stimulating economic growth and youth employment. So there\u2019s hope. After that, it was down to business. Not Brexit business, regrettably: \u201caccelerated practical co-operation\u201d with Nato, investment in the western Balkans, competitiveness, cross-border portability of e-commerce, migration, relations with Libya. Before last Friday, Cameron, sat at the end of the table in his shirt sleeves, might have been quite interested in some of this. Presumably not now. Not difficult, though, to imagine the ambience. These were the people, after all, with whom he hammered out, over some long, long nights all those centuries ago in February, that \u201creformed relationship\u201d deal between Britain and the EU \u2013 the one he was supposed to use to keep Britain in the EU, but barely mentioned during the referendum campaign. The day began, as these meetings surely now will for untold aeons to come, with a chill smile, an embrace, a brief, brave pretence that in spite of everything, we might still stay friends \u2013 and the sudden, sinking realisation that that\u2019s definitely not going to happen. Divorces are like that. First up, in the European parliament, was an avuncular Juncker, greeting Nigel Farage with a kiss. Then a slap. \u201cWhy are you even here?\u201d he shot. Finally presented with incontrovertible proof that Britain\u2019s semi-detached, not to say bolshy attitude down the years masked \u2013 as they had suspected all along \u2013 full-blown perfidy, MEPs seethed with barely contained fury. \u201cShame on you,\u201d Manfred Weber, a good friend of Merkel, hurled at Farage. \u201cThe worst among the liars.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, a mild-mannered former prime minister of Belgium, waded into the fray, taking a thinly veiled swing at Boris Johnson: much of this could be put down, Verhofstadt said, to \u201cthe selfishness of one man, prepared to do anything to become prime minister of the UK\u201d. But there was warm applause \u2013 indeed, a standing ovation \u2013 for an emotional Scottish MEP, Alyn Smith. \u201cWe will need cool heads and warm hearts,\u201d he urged his fellow parliamentarians. \u201cBut please, remember this: Scotland did not let you down. I beg you, do not let Scotland down now.\u201d With appeals to their European hearts like that, it did not take long for everyone to conclude the only thing they could possibly do under the circs was immediately pass a motion calling for Britain to begin formal negotiations on leaving the European Union \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. And so, finally, to dinner, Cameron\u2019s chance to \u201cexplain Britain\u2019s position\u201d. \u201cI want the exit process,\u201d he said, \u201cto be as constructive as possible.\u201d Good luck with that one, prime minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
