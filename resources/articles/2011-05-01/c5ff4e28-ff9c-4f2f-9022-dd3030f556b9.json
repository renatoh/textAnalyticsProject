However, that quote was also used as a 46-point headline on the article, which was inappropriate and unnecessary. The editor's guideline on the subject of bad language starts by stating: remember the reader, and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend (9 May, page 5, Media). \u2022 An obituary of David Cairns (11 May, page 34) \u2013 the Labour politician who lost his ministerial job at the Scotland Office in 2008 after declining to express confidence in Gordon Brown's leadership \u2013 mentioned \"two Scottish byelection campaigns which Labour lost badly, Glasgow East and Glenrothes\". The Glenrothes byelection was held two months after David Cairns resigned and was won by Labour, not lost. \u2022 A profile of James Gordon \u2013 who devised a counselling system for people in zones of conflict or disaster \u2013 described him as a psychologist. He is a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists must qualify as medical doctors (Aftershock, 10 May, page 14, G2)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
