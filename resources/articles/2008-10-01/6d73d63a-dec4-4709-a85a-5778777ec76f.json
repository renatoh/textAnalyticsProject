Now that remake has duly arrived. The first time around, a tough cop is drummed out of the force because of a fatal shootout caused by his getting confused by a reflection in the mirror. Afterwards, he has to take a job as a security guard in a supermarket where reflections in the mirrors start attacking people. The remake has Kiefer Sutherland as the cop, but misses out the part played by mirrors in the initial disaster, thus jettisoning the possibility of a rational explanation for what could be delusions. The remake retains the sensationally creepy ending and it's all reasonably done, but no real chills."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
