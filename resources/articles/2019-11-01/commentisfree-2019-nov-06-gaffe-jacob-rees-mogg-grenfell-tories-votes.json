Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Grenfell slur shows how Tories really think", "bodyText": "Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that those who perished in Grenfell Tower lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d was not a gaffe, as one BBC journalist declared. As Maya Angelou put it: \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d Here was a confession, an insight into a worldview steeped in a sense of class privilege and social superiority. We don\u2019t need to read between the lines: the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has done it for us. When the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis put it to him that Rees-Mogg was effectively saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice,\u201d Bridgen did not demur, adding \u2013 after a sigh-filled pause \u2013 \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we, Evan? \u2026 That\u2019s a byproduct of what Jacob is, that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d Leave aside that the Grenfell disaster itself was an indictment of a rotten social order that values money over people\u2019s lives. Here, in the minds of Rees-Mogg and Bridgen, is a world in which the masses are feeble, ignorant, simple-minded, requiring leadership by their supposed social betters who are, quite literally, born to rule. If Rees-Mogg is indeed \u201cvery clever\u201d, it needs more proof than pretentious smatterings of Latin phrases recalled from Eton, and there it is lacking. Accusations of \u201cclass warfare\u201d have always been a staple Tory attack line, normally when confronted with calls to more equitably tax wealth and income. But to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war while the other vigorously fights it. While other Tories may choose their words more carefully, the attitude underpinning Rees-Mogg\u2019s and Bridgen\u2019s words are a feature, not a bug, of their party. Without a sense of social superiority, there would be no Toryism. Indeed, Tories have often been as candid as Rees-Mogg is himself. Labour\u2019s birth as a mass political force had much to do with an infamous court ruling. The Taff Vale legal judgment of 1901 made trade unions liable for profits lost in strikes, effectively rendering industrial action impossible and underlining the need for unions to have parliamentary representation. The future Tory prime minister Stanley Baldwin later admitted: \u201cThe Conservatives can\u2019t talk of class war. They started it.\u201d When Britain\u2019s last general strike, in 1926, ended in defeat for the trade union movement, the former Tory prime minister Arthur Balfour sneered: \u201cThe general strike has taught the working class more in four days than years of talking could have done.\u201d Back in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-hand man Keith Joseph \u2013 a pioneer of market fundamentalism who was later dubbed \u201cthe Mad Monk\u201d \u2013 ruined his Tory leadership chances by making the mistake of saying what he truly thought. He argued that more and more children \u201care being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world and bring them up. They are born to mothers who were first pregnant in adolescence in social classes 4 and 5 \u2026 Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment.\u201d His final line \u2013 \u201cThe balance of our population, our human stock is threatened\u201d \u2013 outed his eugenicist bigotry in its all its ugliness: that the ill-educated poor would out-breed their social superiors. As the daughter of a shopkeeper, Margaret Thatcher herself is frequently portrayed as a challenge to the old Tory toffs, but her snobbery was no less great. As one shadow cabinet minister told the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Young on the eve of her 1979 electoral triumph: \u201cShe is still basically a Finchley lady. Her view of the world is distressingly narrow. She regards the working class as idle, deceitful, inferior and bloody-minded.\u201d Even supposed liberal Tories such as Michael Heseltine believed in the rule of those with privilege over those who did not, even if they believed that rule should be benevolent. He believed in \u201cgood enlightened capitalism \u2013 paternalism if you like,\u201d as he once put it. \u201cNoblesse oblige. I believe strongly that those with power and privilege have responsibilities.\u201d Fear of, and contempt towards, working-class people is an unbroken thread in Tory history. Take the revelation by Nick Clegg that the Tory leadership once told him: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing \u2013 it just creates Labour voters.\u201d Indeed, it reflected a traditional Tory aim: that a sense of solidarity \u2013 that the majority should use their collective power to force concessions from the powerful \u2013 was innately subversive, and needed to be replaced by an everyone-for-themselves individualism. \u201cIt\u2019s not the existence of classes that threatens the unity of the nation,\u201d as one official Conservative party document put it in 1976, \u201cbut the existence of class feeling.\u201d In other words, even to discuss social class meant asking searching questions about why some have wealth and power that go beyond believing that those at the top somehow deserved to be there. It is this worldview that underpins so many policy assumptions. Taxes should be slashed for the rich, because they amassed their wealth through their superior talents and hard efforts. The welfare state should be rolled back, because it merely incentivises the fecklessness and aversion to work that exists among the poor. It is even the rationale used to argue that buildings burn and kill dozens of predominantly working-class people not because flammable cladding was chosen because it was cheaper, or because fire sprinklers weren\u2019t in place because that costs money, but because the victims lacked common sense or leadership skills. It is this sense of class chauvinism that led, in part, to Grenfell \u2013 because who truly thinks that if the tower was full of luxury apartments filled with City slickers and hedge-fund managers that this would have ever happened? So, let\u2019s not dismiss Rees-Mogg\u2019s utterances as gaffes. This is how they see the world: it is the very foundation of their politics. As the Tories pin their election hopes on working-class communities in the North and Midlands, this eternal truth needs to be remembered. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
