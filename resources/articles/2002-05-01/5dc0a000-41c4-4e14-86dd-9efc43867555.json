Among the Croatian players tested was Alen Boksic who has recovered from an abdominal strain and should be fit for the start of the tournament. \u00b7 Ariel Ortega will wear No10 for Argentina following Fifa's decision to bar the south Americans from retiring the shirt in honour of Diego Maradona. Argentina's third-choice goalkeeper Roberto Bonano was originally expected to take the No10 shirt but he will now wear 23. \u00b7 Turkey's team manager has hit back at Brazil's Roberto Carlos for saying that Brazil would beat Turkey at 40% strength. Can Cobanoglu pointed out that Carlos was in the Real Madrid team beaten by the Turkish side Galatasaray, for whom six of the World Cup squad play, in the 2000 Super Cup. \"I well remember how he cried frantically when Real Madrid lost the Super Cup,\" Cobanoglu said. \"How many per cent of his capabilities did he use in that match? Everybody will see that no one can tease with Turkey.\" The sides meet in Ulsan on June 3. \u00b7 Southampton's striker Agustin Delgado returned to action for Ecuador after injury but failed to score as the south Americans were held to a 1-1 draw by the J-League side Kyoto Purple Sanga. Paraguay recorded their third successive win with a 2-0 victory over Urawa Red Diamonds. \u00b7 Around 10,000 tickets for the opening match between France and Senegal on Friday have been put on sale. Fifa has returned the tickets to Korean organisers because of low demand. \u00b7 Cameroon have decided to spend an extra three days at their preliminary World Cup base in Nakatsue after arriving four days later than scheduled in the southern Japanese village. The African champions will now move to their next camp in Fujiyoshida, two hours south of Tokyo, after their World Cup opener against Ireland on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
