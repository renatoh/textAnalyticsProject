There is a libertarian strain in the party, and an ancient alliance between Britain's brewers and the Tories, dating back at least to 1872, when Disraeli's favourite clergyman, William Magee, told the Lords that he'd rather see England free than that same England compulsorily sober. So David Cameron always knew he was going to have a fight on his hands; few, however, would have guessed that he might end up losing. Mr Cameron mostly keeps above the fray on detail \u2013 he could safely ditch forest sell-offs, charity taxes and parts of the NHS reforms, since these were things he never made a public show of embracing. His habit has been to fashion very few distinctive Cameron propositions, recognising that making a policy personal means sticking with it \u2013 or surrendering authority. And for better (protecting the aid budget) or worse (quitting Europe's mainstream centre-right bloc), once Mr Cameron had stuck his neck out, he used to keep it there. But now, as the Cameron command cracks, we hear him redefining aid to include some military spending, and see him putting his stamp on a shaky pledge about cheap energy which doesn't quite do what's promised on the tin. In this context, Ed Miliband's teasing question about the disintegration of unit pricing \u2013 is there anything you could organise in a brewery? \u2013 hit home in the Commons. A year ago Mr Cameron offered minimum prices as the answer to Britain's drink dependency, demonstrating a socially concerned Conservatism, and \u2013 he claimed \u2013 \"a radical government, not frightened of taking big decisions\". Sadly, frightened is precisely how he has ended up. It would be one thing if the Treasury had persuaded him that excise duties could achieve the same thing as a minimum price. Such an argument is awry \u2013 raising taxes on all drinks is a clumsy way to target supermarket loss leaders, and it would unduly punish pubs, when the real problem is drinking at home. But it would have been better for the prime minister to go down in a debate about rival policies than get ensnared in a silly row. The cabinet rebels include Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary who hugged the drinks industry so close that experts walked away from his compromised efforts on alcohol, Theresa May, the woman none too subtly parading her own leadership ambitions, and Michael Gove, the man who has made a great show of riding to Mr Cameron's rescue in response. An unholy alliance, yet it has done Mr Cameron real damage by exposing that what he says in public no longer automatically goes. In the Commons yesterday, his loss of authority was palpable; no doubt he came away feeling the need for a drink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
