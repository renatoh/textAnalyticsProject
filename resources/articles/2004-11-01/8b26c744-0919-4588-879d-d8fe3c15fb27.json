This must surely be a big relief for the coalition forces who were perhaps expecting the worst ... But the US-led forces are in no mood to celebrate the victory, as earlier, when Iraq was declared safe, some of the worst fighting took place ... \"The battle of Falluja can only be seen as one step towards establishing the rule of law in Iraq ... The insurgents had made Falluja their home and terrorised the populace ... The battle had to be taken there. Without that, elections [scheduled for January] would be meaningless.\" Michael Clarke Sunday Times, November 14 \"The stakes were always going to be high in the Falluja operation ... Coalition commanders will be relieved ... that military and civilian losses ... have been lighter than many feared and - for the first time - they are almost in full occupation of the city ... [But] none of this has been about 'peacekeeping' or 'managing insurgency'. It is urban warfare ... \"The imminence of elections means there is likely to be more of this in the weeks to come in Ramadi, Baquba, perhaps in Mosul, Baiji, Samarra or parts of Baghdad ... US commanders and the insurgents both know that the political outcome of Falluja is still to be decided ... However ... the Sunni population has not yet turned its back on the electoral process. Despite the kidnappings and assassinations, progress towards a constitutional Iraq is edging forward.\" Independent Editorial, November 15 \"As in the earlier efforts to root out the leaders of the anti-occupation forces, those specifically named and targeted by the American forces as the chief villains are said to have fled in advance of the attack ... The best hope, and justification, for the conquest of Falluja has been that it will encourage Iraqi acceptance of the interim government and facilitate something like plausible nationwide elections in January. At worst, though, what happened at Falluja will foster all manner of secondary uprisings, making Iraq even less governable than it currently is.\" Wesley K Clark Washington Post, November 14 \"The battle for Falluja ... is part of a larger bargaining process ... to pressure insurgent groups into pre-emptive surrender, to deprive them of popular tolerance and support, and to demonstrate to the Iraqi people and to others that force was used only as a last resort ... \"For most of a year, the effort at political transformation [in Iraq] has been submerged beneath the rubric of 'reconstruction' and hindered by the attitude that 'security must come first'. Security and domestic Iraqi politics go hand in hand ... Troops are in Falluja because of a political failure: large numbers of Sunnis either wouldn't, or couldn't, participate in the political process and the coming elections. Greater security in Falluja may move citizens (whenever they return) to take part in the voting ... But it's certain that you can't bomb people into the polling booths.\" \u00b7 Retired General Wesley Clark ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination Christian Science Monitor Editorial, US, November 15 \"The US has a chance to convince Iraqis that such battles will be won and that it's worth standing up against the insurgents and for democracy. The Iraqis who really need convincing are the Sunnis ... Some ... will continue to call on people to take up arms and to boycott the election. They fear the Shia majority will dominate a nationally elected government. If it can pacify Sunni cities that harbour insurgents before the election, the US will reduce the desire among some Sunnis to revive the Saddam era, when Sunnis ruled. \"Instead, Sunnis may begin to see their only future lies in competing at the ballot box. If that happens, the insurgents would be fighting their own people, and would surely lose. Then the US military will have really won.\" New York Times Editorial, November 15 \"Prospective Sunni voters are understandably sceptical of a political system that so far has favoured Shia and Kurdish exile-rooted parties at every turn ... That impression has been powerfully reinforced by the recent decision, against the strong advice of the US and the UN, to expand the voting to include as many as 4 million expatriates ... [This] threatens to heavily skew the results ... \"Iraqi electoral officials should reverse this damaging decision ... [and the] government should reach out to Sunni groups willing to talk about steps that would make it possible for them to urge their followers to participate in the elections ... \"A new constitution written without credible Sunni participation could become an open invitation to civil war, which could turn into a regional war if Iraq started to splinter into ethnic and religious fragments. A boycott is not inevitable. But avoiding it will require leaders in Washington and Baghdad to fight just as relentlessly for full Sunni political involvement as their soldiers have fought in the streets of Falluja.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
