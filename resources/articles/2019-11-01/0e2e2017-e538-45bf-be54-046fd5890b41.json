Stella\u2019s campaign Twitter account, @2020MNCongress, featured at least two posts involving the idea of Omar being hanged, according to the Washington Times, which broke the story of her suspension. The tweets concerned an unsubstantiated allegation that Omar \u2013 one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress \u2013 shared sensitive information with Qatar, which then wound up with Iran. A spokesperson for Omar previously told the Jerusalem Post of the claim: \u201cSince the day she was elected, Saudi Arabian trolls and mouthpieces have targeted Omar with misinformation and conspiracy theories.\u201d An initial tweet from Stella\u2019s campaign account reportedly said: \u201cIf it is proven [Omar] passed sensitive info to Iran, she should be tried for #treason and hanged.\u201d The Washington Times said the account \u201csubsequently tweeted the link to an article that aggregated her remark, accompanied by a crude depiction of a stick figure hanging from gallows\u201d. The @2020MNCongress account cannot be viewed. Text on the page reads \u201caccount suspended\u201d and \u201cTwitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules\u201d. In a statement, Twitter told the Guardian: \u201cThe account was permanently suspended for repeated violations of the Twitter Rules.\u201d Stella said in a statement: \u201cMy suspension for advocating for the enforcement of federal code proves Twitter will always side with and fight to protect terrorists, traitors, pedophiles and rapists.\u201d The Guardian revealed that Stella has been arrested twice this year over accusations that she shoplifted some $2,300 in goods from Target and $40 in items from a grocery, Stella has maintained her innocence. She has made claims about Omar before, claiming she broke the law by telling immigrants how to avoid authorities. Lawmakers who don\u2019t \u201cuphold the rule of law\u201d, Stella said, should be kicked out of office. A spokesperson for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since winning election to Congress last year, Omar has attracted rightwing attacks and fringe conspiracy theories as well as outright threats of violence. The congresswoman said this April she faced an increase in death threats after Trump accused her of downplaying September 11. On 19 November, New York man Patrick Carlineo pleaded guilty in relation to calling Omar\u2019s office and telling a staffer: \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].\u201d Omar, who came to the US as a Somali refugee, appealed for \u201ccompassion\u201d. \u201cAs someone who fled a war zone, I know how destabilizing acts of political violence can be,\u201d she said in a letter to the judge. \u201cThat his threat of violence relied on hateful stereotypes about my faith only made it more dangerous \u2026 it was a threat against an entire religion, at a time of rising hate crime against religious minorities in our country.\u201d She added: \u201cWe must ask: who are we as a nation if we respond to acts of political retribution with retribution ourselves? The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
