Speaking at the annual retreat for the world's central bankers, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bean said the 'slow-burn' nature of demographic change, as people live longer, and the post-war baby-boomers approach retirement, meant it was 'tempting to postpone the more sensitive decisions'. 'Decisive action may only then be triggered as public debt spirals and participants in the financial markets start worrying about the possibility of default,' he said, warning that there could then be 'movements in asset prices and in saving behaviour', as people realised the seriousness of the situation. By 2050, the United Nations estimates that a fifth of the world's population will be over 60. The Paris-based economic think-tank, the OECD, has urged governments to discourage early retirement and persuade more women to join the workforce, to offset the growing cost of supporting retired people. Bean said that in Britain the knock-on effect from living longer had pumped extra air into the housing market, as investors sought to offset shortfalls in their pension funds by buying property. His remarks echoed a speech by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, in which he called for pension reforms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
