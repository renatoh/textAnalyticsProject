In coping with the human impact, our food bank based here in Austin, Texas, has seen the food lines grow longer. We have distributed more food in the past three years than the first 20 years of the organizations existence. According to census data released Thursday, nationwide the number of people in poverty has grown to 48.5 million, or almost 16% of the population, the highest poverty number in the more than 50 years that it has been recorded. And while the data, although grim, appears to indicate the economy is slowly rebounding, it also provides some insight into what's working in our fight to feed the hungry, and what to expect in the coming months and years. Food stamps work. According to the latest figures, food stamps lifted 3.9 million individuals out of poverty, including 1.7 million children, keeping food on the table for many families. Food stamps are working exactly as they should \u2013 effectively responding to the economic realities of the time. Without them, the emergency hunger relief network in this country could not cope. The slowly rising tide of economic recovery is not lifting all boats. Working poor and middle-income families continue to be disproportionately impacted by the recession. Unless you were very near the top, incomes have declined for most Americans: the median is down. This means low- and middle-income families will take longer to recover from the economic downturn, and we expect our food bank will continue to see long lines for quite some time. Texas, where I work, has a long history with high poverty \u2013 which needs to end. Texas has the sixth highest rate of poverty in the nation, nearly 3% higher than the national rate. One in four Texas children live in poverty, and even here in Austin \u2013 a city often touted as a thriving national success \u2013 one in five Austinites lived in poverty last year. According to research by the Center for Public Policy Priorities (pdf), Texas has owned the title for having a poverty rate higher than the national average for 30 years running. Central Texas has an even longer road ahead. Austin is the third fastest growing largest city in the nation. Disproportionately poor populations, including minority children and older adults also happen to be some of the fastest growing populations in Central Texas: 41% of the clients of our food bank are children. That's 20,000 kids every week. And last year, our food program for older adults served 20% more seniors over the year before. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas is third in the nation of states with the largest share of its hourly workforce earning minimum wage or less. The City of Austin demographer Ryan Robinson recently said: \"We've got two rapidly diverging communities on our hands. One community where life is great, where really, really good jobs are being created. Others have an extremely different experience in Austin.\" This is a real tale of two cities \u2013 and of poverty and hunger in America. The harsh reality for millions of low wage-earning Americans is that even with a job, or two, they struggle to put food on the table and make ends meet. Here at the food bank, we expect to be busy for some time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
