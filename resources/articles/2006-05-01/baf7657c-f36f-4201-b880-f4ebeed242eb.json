Announcing a 19% jump in first-quarter pre-tax profits to 780m euros (\u00a3530m), Noel Forgeard, EADS co-chief executive, said changes would be in line with Airbus's \"financing capacity\". Airbus could spend up to 7bn euros on a new A350, depending on the outcome of talks to buy out the 20% stake in Airbus owned by Britain's BAE. EADS values BAE's stake at 3.5bn euros, but the British firm wants an \"astronomic\" price, EADS said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
