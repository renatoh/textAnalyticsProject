The man could not free himself and was left at the mercy of fierce waves after his leg became stuck under the rocks near the East Promenade in Sheringham on Sunday afternoon. The man spent nearly four hours in the sea, with fire officers having to cut through the rocks to rescue him and finally freeing him soon after the sun had gone down. A Coastguard spokesperson said that the man had been reaching for his child when he slipped and got his leg stuck. Coastguards, police, firefighters and the ambulance service were all at the scene. A rescue team helped to reassure the man and held his head above the water. He was also given a life-jacket and breathing apparatus. Zach Pedley from HM Coastguard said it was a \u201cvery frightening experience\u201d for the man. Stuart Facey, a retired Sheringham coastguard station manager, told the North Norfolk News he was walking his dog in the area when the coastguard arrived. He said: \u201cIt was high tide and water was coming over him so it was a very scary situation.\u201d Facey said people should stay away from the rocks and added: \u201cThe problem is that even if you are able to move a rock to free someone who is stuck, another can fall into its place \u2013 it can be a life or death situation.\u201d A 999 call came in to emergency services just after 5.30pm. The coastguard posted on Twitter that he was freed at 9.16pm. Sam Stockdale, senior maritime operations officer at HM Coastguard, said: \u201cWe often talk about how training matters between the various frontline responders and today has shown just why it does. \u201cEveryone worked together on scene to look after the man and also to free him as soon as was practically possible.\u201d The rescued man was assisted by paramedics after being freed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
