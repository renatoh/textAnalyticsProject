There's more to come from us.\" With England the hosts, and several young players on the field playing their first part in a major tournament, Powell admitted that despite their best preparations, nerves had played their part in a patchy England showing. \"There were a lot of nerves out there,\" she said. \"It's a big day, there were lots of fans here, so we didn't play our best. \"Credit to the girls, they came in at half time and weren't satisfied with their performance, so they were throwing ideas around for changing things. That's how we work.\" Half-time saw surprise starter, Kelly Smith, replaced by Emily Westwood, and England's physical presence in the game diminished. But Powell said her substitution was down to a lack of match fitness, and meant the star player could play a fuller part in the tournament as a whole. She also revealed captain Faye White was taken off because of calf tightness, but should be fine. And she reserved special praise for youngster Karen Carney, another surprise name in the night's starting XI, who scored England's winner in the 90th minute. \"It's fantastic for Karen, she was chuffed to bits with that goal,\" Powell smiled. \"She was calm, composed, she picked her spot and you could see from the bench it was going in. \"She's a really bright prospect in the game.\" England are also looking a promising force in group A, with Sweden and Denmark taking a point each from their draw earlier in the day. They face Denmark on Wednesday, at Ewood Park. \"At this moment in time I'm pleased we're top of the group and Denmark have got it all to fight for,\" Powell said of that meeting. \"Denmark have a point on the board so they're going to come at us \u2013 it will be the toughest game of the group.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
