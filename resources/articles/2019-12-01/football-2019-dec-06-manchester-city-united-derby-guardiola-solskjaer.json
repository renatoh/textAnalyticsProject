Liverpool\u2019s stellar form, a weakness in central defence and a group of players who before Tuesday\u2019s 4-1 thumping of Burnley lacked an edge are key factors for Manchester City being 11 points behind the Merseyside club. Pep Guardiola rates the midfielder Fernandinho over John Stones or Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi as first-choice cover for the injured centre-back Aymeric Laporte, illuminating how the failure to acquire an A-list replacement for Vincent Kompany was a serious error. The win at Turf Moor was a reminder of how energy and effervescence from the manager\u2019s pass-and-move play had dipped: given the deficit this has to remain until May. United, seven points above the drop zone and eight off fourth, made their poorest start since 1988. Here Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, is culpable for a recruitment policy that created a malaise during the five years before Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r became manager. Wednesday\u2019s impressive win over Tottenham is proof of what the Norwegian is hoping to build. Will things improve? Attempting to predict whether United will embark upon an upward trajectory remains a conundrum because Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are young and callow. Yet the results against Chelsea (4-0), Liverpool (1-1), Leicester (1-0) and Spurs (2-1) show how impressive United can be against the division\u2019s toughest opponents. It has to allow optimism that given time the Solskj\u00e6r project will be successful. This means he has to be in place next summer for a second close-season window. City are at a defining moment of Guardiola\u2019s reign: can he and his champions respond despite a third consecutive title seeming remote? The manager will hope his side\u2019s experience of losing at Newcastle in January of last season and then reeling off 14 consecutive victories to retain the championship can be drawn on. Tuesday\u2019s win was a reminder of why City are formidable and, if Liverpool do stumble at all, Guardiola\u2019s men will hope peak form remains to take advantage and the championship race be reignited. How have new signings fared? Guardiola\u2019s penchant for a midfielder may have broadened to full-backs given he signed two when a centre-back was needed. Of these Jo\u00e3o Cancelo has looked shaky and though able to operate along both flanks has made only four league starts. Angeli\u00f1o, re-signed from PSV Eindhoven, was in the starting XI at Turf Moor but lacks the verve of Benjamin Mendy. Rodri is City\u2019s best close-season acquisition: the Spaniard\u2019s elegant style masks a formidable physical presence that makes him a silkier yet still robust long-term replacement for Fernandinho as City\u2019s holding player. Of Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire the central defender has not matched his billing as the expected dead-cert successful acquisition. Maguire can be sloppy in possession, sluggish in anticipation and one-paced. James, though, has taken to Premier League football instantly and wears the United shirt \u2013 which can be \u201cheavy\u201d \u2013 with aplomb, adding pace and sparkle to the frontline. Wan-Bissaka also looks a natural and his \u201cSpider\u201d moniker is apt: not many attackers get the better him at right-back. What would make this season a success? Solskj\u00e6r believes a top-four place can be achieved but if so his side will have to put a run of wins together \u2013 which they have not done since January. United strolled through the Europa League group stage so maybe this or the Carabao and/or FA Cup can be won. In short, fifth place plus a trophy is progress (not real success), top four and no cups would be success. If City cannot retain the title and fail to seriously challenge then reaching the Champions League final is the bare minimum. Guardiola publicly maintains that his team are not ready to be European kings but this is surely a ploy to ease pressure on players given that he has had three seasons and counting to construct an XI of requisite quality. City\u2019s best run under him has been to the quarter-finals, which is a disappointment, so should they retain one or both of the domestic cups but fail to reach the final of the continent\u2019s premier club competition 2019-20 will still rate as a failure. Who have been the stars of the season? The effervescent Raheem Sterling, peerless Kevin De Bruyne and evergreen Sergio Ag\u00fcero lead the City roll call closely followed by Riyad Mahrez, Rodri, David Silva, and Ederson. Honourable mentions can also be given to Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus. This collective illustrate that while City may be third they still remain Liverpool\u2019s greatest threat. Beyond James and Wan-Bissaka for United, Marcus Rashford has nine league goals and was virtually unplayable against Spurs, Scott McTominay is becoming a genuine United midfielder and Victor Lindel\u00f6f is reliable at centre-back. Inconsistency is found in Anthony Martial (three league goals), Fred (good against Spurs) and Andreas Pereira (can be promising), while Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and the remainder of the squad \u2013 apart from the goalkeeper, David de Gea \u2013 all have to start returning eight-out-of-10 displays rather than their usual less than five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
