On the journey home, they fall into eager debate. Young Turk: What an amazing play! I never knew old man Rattigan had so much blood in him. But you\u2019re probably fed up with seeing this piece by now? Old Hack: Not at all. I think it\u2019s Rattigan\u2019s profoundest exploration of one of his favourite themes: the inequality of passion. After all, it shows a woman, Hester Collyer, driven to suicidal desperation by the inability of her lover, Freddie Page, to fulfil her emotional and sexual needs. It says a lot about postwar England while offering a timeless study of the human heart. YT: That\u2019s what I loved about Paul Foster\u2019s production. I\u2019d expected something a bit tight-lipped and restrained, like Brief Encounter. But Hester and Freddie really go at it hammer and tongs. Freddie, who has had a good war but can\u2019t adjust to the postwar world, reminded me of the heroine of David Hare\u2019s Plenty, and Hester even prefigures John Osborne\u2019s Jimmy Porter in her need for a partner who can match her fire. OH: All true. But this is also a play about a very English kind of male inhibition \u2013 which is perfectly exemplified by Hester\u2019s high court judge husband, Sir William, who pleads with her to return. His tragedy is that he is a victim of his class in the way he equates love with social convention, but Gerald Kyd is encouraged to play him with such table-thumping ferocity that you\u2019re almost surprised Hester doesn\u2019t go back to him. YT: You\u2019re dead wrong. The production\u2019s whole point is that all these characters have a hidden fury. That\u2019s true of Hadley Fraser\u2019s Freddie, who is not just some cheery ex-RAF chappie but a man whose sense of failure drives him to drink and who is the play\u2019s real victim, in that he goes off to almost certain death. OH: Fair enough. But did the actors have to shout so much? Perhaps we can agree about Nancy Carroll\u2019s Hester. At times, she looked at Freddie with the tender gaze of the hopelessly smitten: at other times, as when she swept a bottle of whisky off the table, she seemed to pulsate with rage. I liked her best, however, when she was at her quietest, as in the scenes with the struck-off doctor \u2013 beautifully played by Matthew Cottle \u2013 where she perfectly caught Hester\u2019s sense of shame and despair. YT: I thought she was magnificent all through. She conveyed Hester\u2019s hysteria but there were also subtle touches such as the way she carefully packed in Freddie\u2019s luggage the two things that mattered most to him: a mounted cricket ball and a copy of Wisden! OH: That was good. But I still feel in Rattigan there is a tension between the power of the emotion and the means of expression, which I only truly felt in the desolate final moments. YT: That\u2019s a cliched vision of how Rattigan should be played. I loved this production because it was about two incompatible souls trapped in an impossible situation. I\u2019d unhesitatingly give it five stars. OH: I\u2019d give it three. YT: Shall we agree to split the difference? \u2022 At the Minerva, Chichester, until 27 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
