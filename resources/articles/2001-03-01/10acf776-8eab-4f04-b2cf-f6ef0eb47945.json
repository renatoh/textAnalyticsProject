The primary, secondary and special schools have used a range of initiatives, including pupil reward systems, to encourage full attendance, registration throughout the school day, and recruitment of learning mentors to tackle the problems and take the pressure off teachers. One of the schools praised for closely involving pupils in their strategies was Water Hall combined school in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire. At the 500-pupil primary school, headteacher Jackie Barnes explained that pupils have been key to the success of the school's \"buddy\" system. Children with a record of not turning up are paired up with a \"buddy\" - a fellow pupil who lives close by - who calls on them every morning to escort them to school. This system has been highly effective in providing motivation for disorganised children who find it difficult even to get out of bed. \"Where the kids take control of something themselves, it has a better chance of being successful,\" Mrs Barnes said. \"You can't rely on parents when they have problems themselves, such as drugs or long-term unemployment. The buddy system fosters friendships and a sense of belonging, which is an additional reason for going to school.\" Calling parents on the first day of a child's absence is a time-consuming exercise, but it yields results. On Monday Mrs Barnes made 62 calls. Weekly class awards and termly awards for pupils with 100% attendance are made, with individual pupil records displayed in school. The school's target is for 95% attendance, although a handful of children remain at the bottom of the league on less than 30%. The \u00a38,000 award from the Department for Education will be used, appropriately, to help fund a breakfast club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
