He accused academics and university leaders of engaging in a \"conspiracy of silence\" about the fall in higher education standards due to underfunding. The well-known television political pundit said the twin pressures of increased student numbers and publishing research meant that students are now taught less and do far fewer essays. His intervention came as Charles Clarke, the education secretary, and fellow ministers were desperately trying to persuade Labour rebels to back the government's plans to allow universities to charge top-up fees of up to \u00a33,000 to be repaid after graduation. Prof King said that because vice chancellors and lecturers were loyal to their institutions in a competitive world, they covered up the true situation. \"Britain's universities still have areas of tremendous strength, but they increasingly resemble those elegant mansions in the American South that one sees in films, with imposing facades in front but decay and ruin concealed behind,\" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph today. Universities' response to the pressures to do research and take in more students was one of the \"best kept secrets in Britain\", he said. \"They respond in the only way they can - by teaching less.\" Prof King said when he first arrived at Essex, each student in his department took five courses throughout each academic year and was required to submit five substantial essays for each course - a total of 25 a year. Students were taught for at least 25 weeks a year. Now students took only four courses and wrote three essays in each, a total of 12 compared with the previous 25, he said. Students were now taught in larger groups and there was intense pressure to cut the teaching year to 20 weeks. \"Students in Britain are being systematically short-changed,\" Prof King said. A third pressure of administration - assessments, audits, students' rights and the fear of lawsuits - was also cutting the time for teaching, he added. \"Undergraduates at British universities do not work remotely hard enough. Indeed they work very little - probably on average not more than 20 hours a week. We, their teachers have neither the time nor the energy to make them work harder. If my department reverted to requiring students to write 25 essays a year, my colleagues and I would simply buckle under the strain. \"University teachers thus work far harder than in the past and university students work much less hard - and as a result emerge from university less well educated. That in practice is what underfunding really means,\" wrote Prof King."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
