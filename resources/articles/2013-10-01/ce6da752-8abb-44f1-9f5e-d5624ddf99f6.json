At 28 years old, Catton is the youngest author ever to win the prize, while her book is the longest to take the accolade. Though Catton is unique among Booker winners, she is in esteemed literary company for such early success. Here's an interesting list of Catton\u2019s precocious predecessors \u2013 such as Hemingway who published his first novel at 27 and Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein at 19. In a beautiful piece on what she calls the \u201cland that casts its shadows on the clouds,\u201d Catton writes for the Guardian on her homeland of New Zealand and the failures of language when confronted with such a sublime landscape: \u201cTo grow up is to confront the disappointments of language, in a way, and to suffer the divorce between what we experience and what we imagine to be real.\u201d In a moving essay similarly concerned with children\u2019s interaction with language and stories, Jeanette Winterson examines Oscar Wilde\u2019s magical children\u2019s tales, which have often been dismissed as lesser works in his canon. Winterson argues that we need fairytales, and writes of Wilde\u2019s allegorical worlds of appearance versus imagination, gift and sacrifice, love and the soul. \u201cWhen a child reads of a Nightingale who bleeds her song into a rose for love's sake, or of a Selfish Giant who puts a wall round life\u2026the child knows at once both the mystery and truth of such stories.\u201d In a different kind of books interview this week, we published an edited version of Neil Gaiman\u2019s lecture for the Reading Agency \u2013 a manifesto on the importance of reading for pleasure as a means to escape and to build empathy. Our future depends on libraries, reading and daydreaming, he writes. \u201cYou get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed.\u201d As the second in a projected 17 volume series of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s letters is published, this week\u2019s Guardian Books Podcast focuses on letter writing and the insights they give into authors\u2019 lives. We\u2019re joined by Simon Garfield to discuss Hemingway\u2019s correspondences and the art of letter writing traced through the ages, and Don Bachardy explains why he\u2019s decided to publish the love letters he exchanged with Christopher Isherwood. Elsewhere on the web, I\u2019d like to highlight two responses to controversial pieces on literary culture. Jonathan Franzen\u2019s recent essay for the Guardian was an attack on our technoconsumerism. For Kill Your Darlings Connor Tomas O\u2019Brien responds to Jonathan Franzen's recent Guardian essay on What's Wrong With The Modern World, highlighting the problem with chastisement rather than empathy. The best critics are tangled up in what they\u2019re criticising, he argues In Overland, meanwhile, Alec Patric writes a considered essay on the purpose and future of literary magazines that follows Robyn Annear\u2019s controversial article in The Monthly about the purpose (or lack thereof) of Australian literary journals. This week's reviews The most exciting fiction release this week is undoubtedly Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch. But is it worth the wait? Kamila Shamsie notes that Tartt\u2019s new work, like her two previous novels, begins with a compelling and climactic opening. She asks whether \u201cat the end of the kind of set piece to which the word \u2018climactic\u2019 should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren't you setting your readers up for disappointment? Astonishingly, the answer is no.\u201d In non-fiction, is a work that invokes in its title Miles Franklin\u2019s famous work, My Brilliant Career. Rachel Cooke\u2019s Her Brilliant Career: Ten Extraordinary Women of the Fifties looks at women who \u2013 with phenomenal energy and determination \u2013 built the brilliant careers they wanted. From a magazine founder to a racing driverthis is an inspiring work for those who, \u201cin a painfully slow job market, will find themselves trying secretly, stubbornly to keep their ambitions in view.\u201d You can read all these reviews and many more here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
