Simon Timson, currently head of the England development programme and science and medicine at the ECB, will take over as performance director from Peter Keen, who quit UK Sport after eight years shortly before last summer's Olympics. He will be charged with carrying on from Team GB's best performance in 104 years, when they racked up 65 medals including 29 golds, and secured third in the medal table. The government has already confirmed that UK Sport, which invested \u00a3312m of lottery and exchequer funding in Olympic sport in the four years leading up to the Games, will have its funding maintained for the 2016 Rio cycle. It will announce in December how that money will be allocated under its \"no-compromise funding formula\" that ruthlessly targets investment at those sports most likely to win medals. The UK Sport chief executive, Liz Nicholl, has already claimed that Team GB will become the first host nation to match their medal achievement at the next Olympics, in Rio in four years' time. \"I'm delighted to be taking up this significant leadership role within UK Sport at such an exciting time, with such a strong performance in London to build upon,\" said Timson. \"I feel confident the system possesses the knowledge, expertise and tools required to sustain success and will be looking to the lessons learned from the London cycle, to see where there is room for improvement.\" Timson will take up his role in January. Keen, who started the revolution at British Cycling before joining UK Sport to apply the lessons more widely in 2004, is to stay on in a part-time role as special adviser for performance. Before joining the ECB, where he is credited with introducing a string of performance innovations, Timson was performance director at British Skeleton. His tenure coincided with a run of medals for the sport, and winter sports are likely to be one area of his immediate focus with the Sochi Games looming in 2014. Nicholl said Timson is a \"stand-out candidate\" and his appointment was also welcomed by the sports minister Hugh Robertson. \"Simon Timson has an excellent track record both in high-performance sport and academically in sports science,\" he said. \"His experience as an Olympic performance director as well as his time at the ECB, where he helped England become the best cricket team in the world, will be a big asset to elite sport in the UK as we look to move forward from the fantastic performances at London 2012.\" Meanwhile, the only remaining rival to Lord Coe to replace Lord Moynihan as chairman of the British Olympic Association has withdrawn his application. Richard Leman, the former international hockey player who is president of GB Hockey and sits on the BOA board, said he wanted to leave the way clear for Coe to be elected on November 7. Moynihan announced immediately after the London Olympics that he planned to step down a year early. \"Recognising the unique circumstance in which we find ourselves in having the person who led the organisation and delivery of what is widely regarded as the most successful Olympic and Paralympic Games in history standing for election as our next Chair, I have decided to put my full support behind Seb Coe and his candidacy,\" said Leman. \"The opportunities and challenges we face during the next four years are unprecedented, and from my position as a member of Board of Directors, I will continue to work closely with our next Chair, my colleagues on the Board, the National Olympic Committee and our staff to meet those challenges.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
