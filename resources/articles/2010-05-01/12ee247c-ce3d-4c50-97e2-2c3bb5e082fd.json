If some actor isn't playing Boy George, then some producer is chucking together a documentary about the new romantics, and there you are, slumped in front of the box, thinking \"those were the days\" \u2013 even though when those were the days, being on Top of the Pops was \"selling out\". But the documentary about the making of Heaven 17's first album, Penthouse and Pavement, tucked neatly into the schedules after Newsnight on Monday, should have had a health warning on it, it was so absorbing. An elegiac tribute to the lost industry of Sheffield, as well as to the energy and creativity of ordinary boys who wanted their voices to be heard, it captured the period in its tragedies and triumphs, perfectly. Martyn Ware (who had previously founded the Human League) and Glenn Gregory (who hadn't) did most of the talking. They were great on growing up in a steel town, where everyone was involved in measuring and making. Growing up in a steel town myself, I knew exactly what they meant. They even talked about the lulling sound of 24-hour production, which I missed so much when I moved away, and which featured so mesmerically in their music. But they caught the ambivalence of those times as well. Neither of the men, when they were young, had wanted to go into the factories. Ware, in particular, having visited his father's workplace, described the prospect as hellish. Yet, despite this personal rejection, there was still fury that it had all been dismantled. There is talk now of reviving heavy industry in Britain, and of shipyards being adapted to make wind turbines. I like this idea very much. Yet all I could think about were the skills that were dumped in that period, and the difficulty of bringing them back now that a generation has been lost, and not all of it to the music industry. Such destruction, and such folly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
