What did audiences make of it? Freddie Cozzolino, London It's about good versus evil. If he's really the murderer of the missing girl, should the vigilante have her way? Mike McCahill, Coventry This film struck me as dishonest and insincere. Gary Powell, London I didn't know who to feel sorry for. It's a very prickly subject for a mainstream movie. Shahada Begum, London You think he didn't do it, until the last minute. If he went around killing girls, then it's damn right she castrated him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
