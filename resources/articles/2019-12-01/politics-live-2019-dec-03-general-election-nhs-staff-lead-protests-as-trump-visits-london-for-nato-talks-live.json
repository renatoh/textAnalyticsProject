If you\u2019d like to read more on today\u2019s Nato reception, my colleague Caroline Davies has the full story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s politics news: The faking of an email that was used to back up the Lib Dems\u2019 claims in a row with a news website over an embarrassing story was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d, the party\u2019s leader has said. A senior member of the party\u2019s campaign team was suspended over the debacle last week. This evening, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said: Clearly, as has been reported, that there was an email that was sent ... which was inaccurate, which was faked and that is not acceptable. There is an investigation. The member of staff has been suspended, and I am not going to comment further on staffing matters. There is an investigation. That particular incident is absolutely unacceptable and that\u2019s why we have taken the swift action and are investigating. We reported earlier that the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had said he was planning to confront Donald Trump over the plausibility of his assurances on the NHS during a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening (see: 2.44pm). There was some skepticism about whether or not Corbyn would be able to address the subject with Trump and the Guardian now understands he did not get the opportunity to do so. Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, were left out in the cold outside No 10 as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, were invited to go inside ahead of them. The world leaders arrived at the Downing Street reception together in the US president\u2019s car, the Beast, this evening. A choir ran through Christmas songs as guests began arriving, including Hark the Herald Angel, Walking in a Winter Wonderland and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, had arrived about 20 minutes earlier, followed shortly after by Justin Trudeau, then Angela Merkel, who stopped to admire the choir. The US president and first lady paused on the steps of No 10 for photographs but did not speak before entering. The prime minister has met the German chancellor and the French and Turkish presidents this evening to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: The leaders discussed the broad strategic, economic and defence partnerships between their countries and agreed the importance of further deepening these, including through Nato. On Syria, the leaders agreed that humanitarian access, including cross-border, must be ensured and that a UN needs assessment should form the basis for getting aid to those who require it in the north-east. The leaders said they would work to create the conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of refugees and that the fight must be continued against terrorism in all its forms. They also agreed that all attacks against civilians in Syria, including those in Idlib, must stop. They noted their support to the constitutional committee process and the importance of UNSCR 2254. On Libya, the leaders reiterated their support for SRSG Salame [special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salam\u00e9] to move forward a Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the United Nations and supported by the Berlin Format. The leaders agreed that meetings in this format should continue. This is Kevin Rawlinson taking over the liveblog for the evening. My colleague Vikram Dodd has this report on the damning comments of the former head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, Robert Quick, who attacks the prime minister for peddling \u201ccliches\u201d about sentencing laws after last Friday\u2019s terror attack. Quick says cuts to police numbers have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said in a press conference in the UK in June that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use. On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed that he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he also said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister. Asked about this, he replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump had very clear thoughts on the election: he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage. In a rare display of self-awareness that helped to explain his relative reticence, Trump also told the press conference today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d. During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away, and to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron (for being rude about Nato, of all things - even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d). So, on the Trump mayhem front, the UK got off quite lightly. Corbyn has cast doubt on the plausibility of Trump\u2019s NHS assurances and said he intends to take the matter up with the president at a reception at Buckingham Palace early this evening. As I write, it is not clear yet whether the two men will be able to have a proper conversation \u2013 or whether their encounter (if it happens at all) will not get beyond pleasantries. Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. Nigel Farage has claimed that Johnson only became prime minister because he launched the Brexit party this year out of anger about Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He may be right. A new biography of May claims Johnson has said something similar in private. Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents involving Labour party members and said he was dealing with the issue. A host of leading cultural figures, including the actors Steve Coogan, Mark Rylance and Julie Christie, the grime artist Kano and the writer and environmentalist Naomi Klein, have united to back Corbyn and praised Labour for prioritising \u201cpeople and planet over profit\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for this evening. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil has said the Tories are still refusing to suggest a date for his proposed interview with Boris Johnson. These are from my colleague Damien Gayle, who is covering the anti-Trump protest in London this afternoon. And Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the latest YouGov polling. Here are three polling-related stories/blogs that are worth reading. The Evening Standard says polling in London shows that Labour is increasing support. It says: In a big squeeze on smaller parties as polling day draws closer, Labour appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats and Brexit party, which have both lost support. Labour\u2019s lead in the capital has improved to 17 points, according to the YouGov survey commissioned by Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Mile End Institute, and its leader\u2019s image has improved. But the poll marks a significant decline compared with its 22-point lead in the capital at the 2017 general election, putting at least two Labour marginal seats in danger. This table has the figures. Stephen Bush at the New Statesman says Labour is gaining generally at the Lib Dems\u2019 expense. He says: After weeks of what looked like noise within the margin of error \u2013 thanks in part to the fact that very few pollsters are now doing polls more than once a week, which makes it difficult to draw out trends \u2013 we can now say with certainty that Labour are gaining ground in the polls. They are not doing so at the rate they did at the last election yet, and the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls, but there is a clear trend: of Labour gaining ground thanks to defections from the Liberal Democrats and Greens. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, you should pay very little attention to the headline figures, because they might be wildly wrong in either direction. As it stands, we are a normal-sized polling error \u2013 that is to say, if either or both of the parties are being systematically under- or over-estimated by three percentage points \u2013 from either a Labour minority government or a Conservative landslide. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now a polling specialist, says the latest polling he has commissioned shows Boris Johnson extending his lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the best PM measure. He says: Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has widened slightly to 17 points (44% to 27%) from 15 points last week. The proportion of Labour leavers naming Johnson is up slightly from last week at 40%, though still lower than when the campaign began. 84% of 2017 Conservatives name Johnson as the better of the two, while just 55% of 2017 Labour voters name Corbyn. The changes marked in the chart are from last week. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Boris Johnson floated the idea of introducing charges for the NHS, including for ambulance visits, in a Spectator column in 1995, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov has revealed. In his story Bienkov reports: \u201cIf NHS services continue to be free in this way, they will continue to be abused, like any free service,\u201d [Johnson] wrote in the Spectator magazine in 1995. \u201cIf people have to pay for them, they will value them more.\u201d He added that those who say \u201cthe future NHS should be for those who are genuinely sick, and for the elderly,\u201d are \u201cbang on the nail.\u201d Writing about his own experience of calling for an ambulance for one of his children, who then turned out not to be seriously ill, he asked: \u201cWhy should I not be charged, say, \u00a350 for that inglorious episode, a fraction of its real cost?\u201d Johnson added that \u201cit seems reasonable that the middle classes should be required to stump up for non-essential services they can well afford.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has claimed that this proves Johnson has \u201cextremist views on the NHS\u201d and that he does not support the NHS being free at the point of use. At the time Johnson wrote the Spectator article he was not an MP. He has not expressed views like this recently, and the Conservative manifesto describes the NHS as representing \u201cthe best of this country\u201d, particularly because it is free at the point of use. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that she does not trust Donald Trump when he says that he does not want the NHS to be included in a UK-US trade deal. (See 10.15am.) Responding to what Trump said this morning, and referring to what the president said in a press conference in Britain in the summer, she said: [Trump] said something different earlier in the year when he said it would certainly be on the table. So, I think he is hardly somebody who is known for you being able to trust what they say. Swinson also suggested that Trump\u2019s comments this morning had been coordinated with No 10. Asked if she thought they had been agreed with Downing Street, she replied: We can just remember what it was like when Trump went on Nigel Farage\u2019s radio show and said that he wanted Farage and Johnson to do a deal, and a few days after that that\u2019s exactly what happened ... I\u2019m sure they have had conversations whether he will be helpful or not during the time that he is here. At a campaign event in Perth, where the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart is hoping to increase his majority of 23 votes over the Tories, I witnessed a phenomenon that it\u2019s important to register is still ongoing: someone bursting into tears as they get a selfie with Nicola Sturgeon. \u201cHow can you not love her?\u201d asked a tearful June Abbott, 69, a long-time independence supporter after the first minister had apologised for making her cry. \u201cShe just feels like she\u2019s one of us.\u201d As cheering activists congregated around Wishart and Sturgeon at the city street stall, many reported what they believe is a change in mood towards their party since the last election campaign. The presence of a Brexit party candidate, who locals say has not been particularly visible, certainly helps in terms of hoovering up some former Tory voters, but Wishart himself was in buoyant mood, telling journalists that the two words doing best on the doorstep were \u201cBoris\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u201d in terms of winning SNP votes. Speaking to reporters during the visit, Sturgeon repeated concerns that Scotland\u2019s NHS was \u201con the line\u201d if a Tory-Trump post-Brexit trade deal were to take place. Asked about continuing concerns from the Scottish Jewish community about the SNP propping up a Corbyn minority administration, she said that she had yet to watch Corbyn\u2019s earlier remarks on antisemitism (see 11.32am), but added: My position is clear. We take action, as we did last week with a candidate [suspending Neale Hanvey, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after allegedly antisemitic social media posts came to light] where there is a need to do that. I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not. Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats. He said: If we had stood against the Conservatives in those seats, I think you\u2019d have seen two dozen more Liberal Democrats led by Jo Swinson. Farage also claimed that he deserved the credit for Johnson becoming prime minister. He said: The only reason Boris is prime minister is because, earlier this year, I had had enough. After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen. Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, May at 10, Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest. Johnson said: There are two people I credit for my emergence as frontrunner: Theresa May for her failure to deliver, and Nigel Farage, who exploited the position left by her failure to deliver. If you can bear reliving the last three years, May at 10 is well worth reading. Some of the revelations are extraordinary. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has posted a very good thread on Twitter explaining the extent to which drug prices would be an issue in a UK-US trade deal. It starts here. And here are his conclusions. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here are the main points from what Jeremy Corbyn said in his interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 earlier about President Trump and the NHS. Corbyn said he hoped to be able to tell President Trump tonight that the NHS would not be for sale in UK-US trade talks. The two men are both attending a Buckingham Palace reception for the Nato summit. Corbyn said, if he got the chance, he would deliver a message to Trump. Asked what he would say, he replied: I will say: \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our national health service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale and investor state protection is not acceptable to our government when we\u2019ve won this election.\u2019 Corbyn also stressed that he would be polite. He was \u201calways polite\u201d, he said. Corbyn said he would ask Trump to change the guidelines issued to his trade negotiators to reflect the fact that the NHS was not on the table. Asked what he would say to Trump if Trump told him that he did not want access to the NHS, Corbyn replied: I will say: \u2018Thank you very much. I assume that will now be the basis of your administration\u2019s talks with our Department of [International] Trade.\u201d But Corbyn also expressed scepticism about the assurances that Trump has given on this subject today. Asked about Trump saying this morning that the US would not want access to the NHS, even if that were offered \u201con a silver platter\u201d (see 10.15am), Corbyn replied: I\u2019m pleased that he said that. But if that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years. Why have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released. And I think there [are] very, very legitimate grounds for very, very serious concerns. Corbyn was referring to the talks between UK and US officials described in detail in confidential government papers that were leaked and released by Labour last week. When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied: Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied: Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point: When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied: I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else. And also make very clear that any trade relationship with the USA will not involve investor protection for US companies and will absolutely not involve access to our public services, and crucially, of course, our national health service. And this is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who was with Boris Johnson in Salisbury this morning. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale From BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stefano Q: You have the lowest popularity ratings for a leader since records began. Does that worry you? Corbyn says he does not comment on polls. He will not start now. This is not just about him, he says. He says he has a lot of highly motivated candidates who want to win the election. The interview is over. Vine says they asked if there was a record Corbyn wanted to play. He says he was told Get Ready, by the Temptations. Corbyn says he would be an \u201chonest broker\u201d in a second referendum campaign. Q: What happens if your team negotiates a fantastic Brexit deal, and you can hardly contain your excitement? Corbyn says he can contain his excitement in all circumstances. Q: But what happens if it is so good that you should campaign for it? Corbyn says he wants the public to take the decision. Q: In your heart of hearts you are a Brexiter, aren\u2019t you? Corbyn says he has been accused of many things. He wants a prosperous economy, and for the people to make the final decision. Q: You are promising lots of free stuff. Can you afford this? Referring to broadband, Corbyn says this is an essential service. Q: The IFS says it is unlikely Labour will be able to raise the sums it needs for its plans. Corbyn says that is what the IFS says. He says Labour thinks it can raise the money. There is a debate to be had about this, he says. He says the Labour party has spoken to the IFS about this. Q: And, after the manifesto came out, you announced plans to spend \u00a358bn compensating the Waspi women. Where does that money come from? Corbyn says Labour would use the \u201cheadroom\u201d available. Is it right to break a contract with these women, he asks. He says these women paid into the system expecting a pension. Q: Shouldn\u2019t Labour have pointed out in the 1990s what the government was doing on this? Corbyn says Labour has said it will address this, and it will. And here are some lines from earlier in the interview. Jeremy Corbyn is being interviewed by Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 now. Q: Dave Merritt, whose father Jack was killed in the London Bridge attack, said he did not want politicians to exploit his son\u2019s death. But hasn\u2019t Labour done some of this as well as the Conservatives, by talking about spending cuts? Corbyn says he met Dave Merritt at the vigil yesterday. He says resources for prisons and the Probation Service are an issue. Q: But won\u2019t lots of people support the Tory \u2018lock them up and throw away the key\u2019 approach? Corbyn says this would require many more prison places. And eventually prisoners come out. Q: Doesn\u2019t this case suggest deradicalisation does not work? Corbyn says the government should not allow prisons to become a breeding ground for extremism. Here is more from what President Trump said in his press briefing earlier. Asked if he could work with a possible Prime Minister [Jeremy] Corbyn, Trump replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. Trump also seemed to acknowledge that he might not be popular in the UK. This sounded new; on previous visits, he has been keen to boast about how popular he is in the UK. (He isn\u2019t.) In response to a question about the UK election, Trump said in the US, when he endorsed candidates, he helped them win elections. But Britain was different, he said. I\u2019ve won virtually every race that I\u2019ve participated in [in the US, where he has endorsed candidates.]. But this is a different country. I say often, in Germany they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn\u2019t do. I love Germany, I love this country, I love other countries. But I\u2019m representing the US. So they may not like me because I\u2019m representing us, and I represent us strong. President Obama did not represent us [strongly]; he gave everything away, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re still paying a price for what he did. So, I\u2019ll stay out of the election. Channel 4 has been cleared over its use of an ice sculpture to stand in for Boris Johnson during a debate on climate change, Ofcom has said. As PA Media reports, Ofcom said the prop \u201cwas not a representation of the prime minister personally\u201d, and that \u201clittle editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The Conservatives complained that the broadcaster failed to allow the former environment secretary Michael Gove to be its representative for the debate, during which party leaders faced questions over how they would tackle climate change. Rejecting the complaint, Ofcom said: Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate. Depending on the circumstances, they may choose to proceed without having agreed the participation of a particular political party or politician, providing they take steps to ensure the programme complies with our due impartiality and elections rules. In this case, the election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4\u2019s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative\u2019s viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight. The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants. The committee therefore considered that this programme, including the use of the ice sculpture, did not raise issues warranting further investigation under our due impartiality and elections rules. Boris Johnson said he could \u201ccategorically rule out\u201d that \u201cany part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations\u201d, including pharmaceuticals, when he spoke to reporters during a campaign visit to Salisbury this morning. He described Labour claims that the NHS was under threat (see 9.19am) as \u201cpure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Asked if Donald Trump\u2019s support was an embarrassment to him, Johnson said: On the contrary and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel and that\u2019s vital for the UK and we\u2019ll be having a series of meetings \u2013 bilateral, trilateral of all kinds \u2013 in the course of the next couple of days. Any readers requiring an explanation of the \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d jibe will find one on Wikipedia here. Like many of Johnson\u2019s cultural references, this one relates to something prominent in the media in the 1970s. Almost a third of voters now say they will vote tactically in the election, according to polling carried out for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), with the proportion rising rapidly. The polling by BMG found 30% of people said they would be \u201cvoting for the best-positioned party/candidate to keep out another party/candidate that I dislike\u201d on 12 December. This is up from 22% saying this at the start of the election campaign, and 24% in a parallel poll last week. Only 51% of people said they would pick \u201cthe candidate/party I most prefer, regardless of how likely they are to win\u201d. The ERS, which has long campaigned for a move from the first-past-the-post electoral system to a proportional method, said the polling \u201cshould sound alarm bells for our democracy\u201d, adding that given the sometimes contradictory advice on who to vote for tactically in different seats, the election could become \u201ca lottery\u201d. In his ITV This Morning interview Jeremy Corbyn also said that he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d for \u201ceverything that has happened\u201d in his party regarding antisemitism. This came when he came under repeated pressure to say sorry from the presenter, Phillip Schofield. (See 10.56am.) Corbyn said: Our party and me do not accept antisemitism in any form ... Obviously I\u2019m very sorry for everything that has happened. But I want to make this very clear: I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it, other parties are also affected by antisemitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives and by us because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever. Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community several times in the past for his party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, but he caused controversy when he refused to apologise last week when challenged to do so in his interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. That interview was mostly rather bland, but at the end Jeremy Corbyn said something that at face value sounded very interesting. Phillip Schofield asked: Would you still be Labour leader at the end of, if you were prime minister, or whatever happens on 12 [December], would you still be Labour leader at the end of the next term? Corbyn replied: I hope so, yes, because I feel I\u2019m fit, I feel I\u2019m quite young enough to do the job ... and I\u2019m very determined to carry out what we\u2019ve got there, because we\u2019ve got [to] change our country, we\u2019ve got to change our society, we cannot go on with this massive division between the richest and the poorest, and call ourselves a decent, civilised country. So, I want to help people all across the country. And that\u2019s what I want our government to do. And, do you know what? I\u2019m absolutely looking forward to doing it, starting in Christmas week. Taken literally, Corbyn seems to be saying he intends to stay on as Labour leader for a full parliamentary term regardless of whether or not he wins the election. But, taking into account the context (ie, the reference to carrying out the Labour manifesto, and being in government) it seems much more likely that Corbyn was addressing the point about whether he intended to serve a full term as prime minister if he wins the election. (He does - or at least, he always says he does when asked this question.) There are very few people at the top of the Labour party who would expect him to stay on for another five years as leader if the party loses, and that does not seem to be what he meant to say. But I will ask the party for clarification. UPDATE: I have amended the paragraph above to say there are very few people at the top of the Labour party who think Jeremy Corbyn could stay on for five years if he loses. The original sentence said that was the view in the party as a whole. It might be, but we don\u2019t know that the membership as a whole thinks on this point, and some members would want Corbyn to stay on for as long as he wanted. Q: Aren\u2019t you exhausted by the campaigning? No, says Corbyn. He says he believes in public service. He believes in representing people. And he wants to have a society where we don\u2019t have food banks, or child poverty. He says he is inspired by the wisdom he encounters. He says he goes around with a note book. He writes notes everywhere he goes. He says everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t. Q: What happens if you don\u2019t win? Corbyn says he intends to win. Q: But if you don\u2019t? Corbyn says his principles and life will be the same. Corbyn says, when he became Labour leader, there were no processes for dealing with antisemitism. He introduced those, plus a fast-track disciplinary system. And a system of education. He says a rabbi was attacked in north London this week. That was disgusting. He has discussed this with other rabbis, he says. Q: Will you apologise to the Jewish community for any antisemitism committed by Labour members? Corbyn starts an explanation. Schofield intervenes: \u201cJust say sorry.\u201d Corbyn says he is sorry for what has happened. He says antisemitism is a poison. You know what happens, from 20th century history, if it is allowed to continue. Q: Many people will fear that, if you tax big business more, prices will go up for everyone. Corbyn says people need higher wages. And we need to so something about child poverty. Raising wages is good, he says. He says he wants to invest in infrastructure and training. Q: President Trump said today he wants nothing to do with the NHS. And it has been claimed that you obtained a dossier about UK-US trade talks that the Russians might have helped to publicise. Corbyn says no one has suggested that that dossier was not accurate. Trump himself has said in the past that everything would be on the table in trade talks. Q: Diane Abbott has called for the abolition of groups like MI5. And you have called for similar things? Corbyn says he is not calling for the abolition of MI5. But he wants these organisations to be accountable. UPDATE: This question relates to an early day motion that Abbott signed in 1989. Abbott does not back the abolition of MI5 now. Jeremy Corbyn is being interview now by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Q: Boris Johnson says in the Sun today that the country would not be safe with you as PM. Is that true? Corbyn says his first job as PM would be to keep people safe. That requires more spending on the police. And, internationally, we should not allow there to be vast areas of ungoverned space. Q: Should terrorists serve life sentences? Corbyn says it depends what they did. Sentences should be decided by courts. But the Prison Service is woefully underfunded, he says. He says the lesson from the London Bridge attack is that we need to improve this. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. At his press briefing President Trump was asked about Prince Andrew. Trump claimed he did not know him. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stafano points out, the picture archive suggests otherwise. At his press briefing President Trump was most critical of his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, who recently said that Nato was suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d. Trump said Macron\u2019s comments were \u201cvery insulting\u201d. He also said has \u201cvery surprised\u201d at Macron\u2019s analysis. He said: Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead which was interesting ... I heard that President Macron said that Nato was brain dead. I think that is very insulting to a lot of different forces. It has a great purpose. Trump said Macron was being \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d to other members of the Nato alliance members, and he attacked Macron\u2019s own domestic record. It is a very, very nasty statement. I think they have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well economically at all. It is a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France when you look at what is going on with the yellow vests. They have had a very rough year. You just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It is very disrespectful. Trump is not necessarily the best person to complain about people being rude about Nato. Before he became president, he called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d in an interview in 2016. Only this week he also called some of its members \u201cdelinquent\u201d. The Trump press briefing is over. According to Sky, he was only expected to say a few words at what had been billed as essentially a photo opportunity. Instead he took questions for around 50 minutes. I will be post more from what he said shortly. This is what President Trump said when he was asked if he thought the NHS should be on the table in trade deals. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. Trump has just been asked if he thinks Jeremy Corbyn needs to do more to tackle the problem of antisemitism in his party. He says he does not know anything about this issue. This is what President Trump said about the UK election. I have no thoughts on it. It\u2019s going to be a very important election for this great country, but I have no thoughts on it. But Trump also said he would be meeting Boris Johnson while he is in the UK for the Nato meeting. Asked if there would be a meeting, he said: I will be meeting with him, yes ... I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries. Asked why he was staying out of the election, Trump said: Because I don\u2019t want to complicate it. I\u2019ll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I think Boris is very capable and I think he\u2019ll do a good job. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he predicted the result of the Brexit referendum in advance, when he was visiting his golf course in Scotland. As explained here, this is not true. Trump defends his policy towards North Korea. He has a good relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, he says. He says if President Obama were still in the White House, the two countries would be at war. Trump claims he has become \u201ca bigger fan\u201d of Nato because Nato members have been flexible. He also says Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is doing a great job. Stoltenberg is with him at this press briefing at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, but Stoltenberg is not getting the chance to say very much because Trump is rambling on at length. Here is the NHS quote. Here are more lines from the Trump press briefing. Donald Trump is speaking to reporters at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, now. He has also claimed he could work with Jeremy Corbyn. He could work with anyone, he said. This is from CNN\u2019s White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins. As Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report in their overnight story, No 10 has been very anxious for Trump to avoid doing or saying anything that would be seen as an endorsement of Boris Johnson because, given Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the UK, that would not be helpful. Trump seems to have got the message (although whether he can maintain his self-restraint for two days remains to be seen). Obviously, the claim that Trump has \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election is not true. He told LBC in an interview last month that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the country and that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man\u201d. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor, who has been covering a Jeremy Corbyn event in London this morning. Last night Jeremy Corbyn released the text of an open letter he has written to Donald Trump asking for assurances that the NHS, and drug prices in particular, will not be included in the proposed UK-US trade deal. It is one of those letters from politicians clearly not drafted in the expectation that it might receive a reply, but it is interesting nonetheless, particularly for the amount of detail it contains about the eight changes Corbyn wants to the American negotiating objectives for a UK-US trade deal. Here is the key extract. To assure the British public that the NHS and other UK public services will not be opened up to \u201ctotal market access\u201d and irreversible privatisation, and that all aspects of NHS pharmaceuticals procurement will truly be taken off the table in a US-UK trade agreement, I am writing to you today to ask you to request US negotiating objectives are revised as a matter of urgency so that they: Exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals. Accept the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to set the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. Drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services. Explicitly rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Exclude any provision on regulatory exclusivities such as data exclusivity, marketing exclusivity, therapeutic exclusivity and other non-patent monopolies. Exclude any provision that could remove caps on the amount the NHS spends on branded medicines each year, including anything that might enable the US to take legal action against the UK\u2019s voluntary price access scheme. Ensure NHS patient data are fully exempted from digital trade and data sharing provisions in the agreement. Exclude any provision that would prevent the NHS from negotiating deals for the health service as a whole. A revision of the US negotiating objectives along these lines would go a long way to reassuring the British public that the US government will not be seeking total market access to the UK public services; that the NHS will not be on the table in US-UK trade negotiations; that a US-UK trade deal will not open up NHS services to irreversible privatisation; and that the US government accepts that our NHS is not for sale in any form. Corbyn also released this video making the same point. This video features a quote from Trump at a press conference with Theresa May in June saying the NHS would be included in trade talks. But when Trump was asked specifically about the NHS, he did not seem to know what the acronym referred to and later, after his comment provoked a major row, he gave an interview saying he did not want the NHS to be included in trade talks. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. As reported earlier, in his Today interview Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was asked by the presenter Nick Robinson about his involvement in a book that advocated privatisation of health services. (See 8.21am) Raab said he has never personally advocated NHS privatisation. Robinson was referring to After the Coalition, a book published in 2011 and written jointly by Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Chris Skidmore, Liz Truss and Raab. At the time they were all Conservative backbenchers. Now three of them are cabinet ministers (Raab, Patel and Truss), Kwarteng attends cabinet as a minister of state and Skidmore is also a minister of state. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has posted an extract from the book on Twitter. Some would argue that allowing private providers to supply NHS services (which happens quite extensively at the moment) does amount to \u201cprivatisation of the NHS\u201d, which is what Raab said this morning that he opposed. But others would argue that phrase implies the wholesale sell-off of the NHS, which is something quite different. More from Dominic Raab\u2019s interview earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the foreign secretary also claimed the Conservatives have no plans to privatise the NHS. It comes after Jeremy Corbyn last week produced leaked papers detailed US trade talks which he claimed proved the NHS was \u201cup for sale\u201d \u2013 an allegation denied by the Tories. \u201c[We\u2019re] absolutely clear there\u2019s going to be no privatisation of the NHS under the Conservatives\u2019 watch or this prime minister\u2019s watch,\u201d Raab said. In relation to drugs, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our protection of consumers in this country. Obviously we want the cheapest and highest quality medicines coming into the NHS, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our position on that whatsoever. Asked about his involvement in writing a paper advocating privatisation, he said: You\u2019ve picked probably a snippet from a pamphlet written a long time ago, but I can tell you categorically I\u2019ve never advocated privatisation of the NHS. The Labour shadow minister Laura Piddock has dodged questions on reports suggesting Russia had a role planting a leaked NHS document that Jeremy Corbyn presented last week as proof the country\u2019s health service was on the table in US trade talks. Reuters reported last night that experts at Oxford and Cardiff universities, as well as the Atlantic Council thinktank, said the document\u2019s release on Reddit before it was seized on by Labour \u201cresembles a disinformation campaign uncovered this year that originated in Russia\u201d. \u201cWhoever did this \u2026 was absolutely trying to keep it a secret,\u201d Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Reuters. \u201cIt carries the spectre of foreign influence.\u201d The story, which the Daily Telegraph splashed on today, led to questioning of Piddock by Sky\u2019s Kay Burley this morning but she dismissed it as a \u201cmassive distraction\u201d. Footage has emerged of Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade apparently arriving in north London to shouts of abuse last night after he touched down on UK soil in Air Force One. The US president\u2019s motorcade was given a frosty welcome as it passed through Camden, with yells of \u201cget out of here\u201d \u2013 and some ruder cries \u2013 from passersby caught on camera. The foreign secretary also said he sympathised with the father of Jack Merritt, whose son was murdered during the London Bridge terror attack on Friday, after he said the tragedy had been used to \u201cfurther an agenda of hate\u201d. Dave Merritt wrote an impassioned piece in the Guardian saying that his son would have been seething at how his death was being used. \u201cWhat Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.\u201d Dominic Raab refused to accept that he had a fundamentally different worldview to that of Jack Merritt. \u201cI sympathise with the anguish of the family and can\u2019t imagine what they must be going through. The first duty that we\u2019ve got as a government is to take every measure we can to make sure that we don\u2019t see further families going through that same suffering and anguish,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Our duty is to protect the public and that\u2019s why, and you mentioned prison places, our manifesto is clear, we don\u2019t want to cut those, we want to increase them by 10,000. Of course, we want to reform and rehabilitate criminal offenders where that\u2019s possible but I think, in this case and in the level of very serious dangerous, criminal offenders, it\u2019s clear that some of those we will struggle to be sure that we can reform, that they will rehabilitate. We are absolutely clear, we will not allow the release of people onto the streets who present a danger. He added: \u201cAnd that separates us from Jeremy Corbyn, who has made clear he would be willing to see those sorts of dangerous offenders released.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, claims he does not know whether Boris Johnson will be meeting the US president, Donald Trump, for one-on-one talks during his visit to the UK for the Nato summit. Amid claims that the prime minister is dodging bilateral talks with Trump, fearing it would hamper his campaigning efforts in the general election, Raab was evasive on the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t know the full range of bilaterals, those things are always very fluid,\u201d Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Actually, the role of this leaders\u2019 summit, and we are hosting it, is for the prime minister to bring all of our north American and European partners together and show that through Nato we can be bigger than the sum of our parts. Asked to clarify again whether he does not know whether the two leaders will be meeting, Raab said: I said that the arrangements for bilaterals are always quite fluid because they\u2019re done on the margins. This is a meeting for Nato as a whole and the prime minister\u2019s job \u2026 is to bring all of our allies together in the same room, not syphoned off in bilaterals because we\u2019ve got this unity of purpose we need to forge to strengthen Nato and that\u2019s the leadership role that the prime minister is taking. Good morning folks, Simon Murphy here to take you through the morning\u2019s politics news as Donald Trump visits the UK for the Nato summit. Looks like the US president still had his attention on affairs back at home when he touched down on UK soil last night: From Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary Labour has promised to end what it calls the \u201chostile environment\u201d for disabled people in the social security system as part of a raft of plans to tackle discrimination. The party\u2019s disability manifesto, published on Tuesday morning, proposes a range of measures across welfare, public services, transport, housing and jobs to enable disabled people to live independently, be treated with dignity and respect, and participate fully in society. The manifesto promises to sweep away a hostile environment of prejudice against disabled people it says was promoted by government to justify nine years of austerity cuts, and replace it with system that ends poverty and offers people security and dignity. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon. The day ahead \u2022 Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in south-west England. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a speech in London on workers\u2019 rights. \u2022 Jo Swinson is expected to visit a farm in the east of England. \u2022 Nato leaders are gathering for the alliance summit over Tuesday and Wednesday. The main talks will take place on Wednesday near Watford and Johnson will break off from election campaigning to play host. Good morning and welcome to another day in politics. Today, Donald Trump is in town and his presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons, with the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason writing that Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with the president in light of the NHS accusations. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among world leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. We\u2019ll have all the politics news for, so stay with us. I\u2019ve got the blog for the first hour or so, you can get in touch with me on Twitter. Thanks for reading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
