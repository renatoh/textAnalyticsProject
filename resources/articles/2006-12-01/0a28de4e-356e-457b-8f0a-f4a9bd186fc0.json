Not a smug smile, more one of relief. For years, I couldn't look in the mirror without a feeling of dread. Being several stones overweight, I hated full-length mirrors; even head-and-shoulders mirrors showed me that I was beginning to develop a thick neck and multiple chins, and opting for fussy necklines and frilly scarves to try to mask the problem resulted in the common disorder, Frumpy Mum Syndrome. Now, I'm almost four stone lighter, five times fitter. I have just one chin, a long neck again, visible collarbones and a cleavage instead of a built-in flotation vest. It's brilliant - I can't help but smile. But it's been a long road getting here, and I've had a rough ride, particularly from so-called colleagues in the media, who reviled me for putting on weight, and then ridiculed me for trying to do something about it. My hair never used to be a problem but nowadays I hate it. It just won't \"go right\", except for maybe a couple of days each month. Trying to time it for TV appearances is a nightmare. In contrast, I've always liked my feet because they're small - size three. If only the rest of me had always been so pleasing. Bumps and spare tyres can be marvellously camouflaged by Magic Underwear, but not so the ravages of age upon my face. There's no doubt, life's baggage is beginning to show. When the time comes (and I'm holding on to the days here), I'll have no qualms about talking to a cosmetic surgeon. My mother won't hear of it yet - she says she'll feel really depressed having a daughter with a facelift."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
