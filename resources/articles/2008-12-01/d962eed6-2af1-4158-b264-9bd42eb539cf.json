Magdeline Makola, 38, who works at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, was discovered in her car in the town of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, on Boxing Day, after officers heard a voice coming from the car. Police believe she may have been held in the boot of her Vauxhall Astra for up to 10 days in freezing conditions in her nightclothes after being tied up and left there. She is now recovering from hypothermia and dehydration. Today Lothian and Borders police said a man had been arrested and charged in connection with the incident. He is expected to appear from custody at Linlithgow sheriff court tomorrow. When South African-born Makola, of Livingston in West Lothian, was found in the car she had not been seen since she left work at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 15 December. Concerns were initially raised when she failed to turn up for her shift on December 18 and she was reported missing. Specially-trained officers have interviewed her in Monklands hospital in Airdrie, where she is recovering. She is receiving support from her friends and members of her local Baptist church in Livingston."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
