But then, this time last year, Kevin Keegan was preparing to face Germany at Wembley in a World Cup qualifier. Today, they meet in the First Division. \"It's not such an incredible turnaround,\" says Vialli. \"This is part of life and part of football in particular. Nothing can be taken for granted, and in football especially things can change overnight.\" Certainly neither manager would have pictured themselves plotting Nationwide League campaigns at this stage in their careers. But it was almost inevitable that the two most high-profile managers outside the Premiership would be drawn to meet each other on the season's opening day. \"It's not so surprising that First Division clubs are attracting big managers,\" says Vialli. \"I think probably there are clubs that want to be part of the big boys, and have an organisation very similar to Premiership clubs - and that attracts managers who want to be in the Premiership. \"The project at Watford is perfect from my point of view, and I suppose that it must be the same at Manchester City. It's quite exciting thinking that you can do something to take a club into the Premiership rather than just starting there.\" Vialli was given - and has swiftly spent - a \u00a35m budget for transfers and wages. At Chelsea he could react to adversity by signing the likes of Marcel Desailly; now he has nothing to rely on but his own ability. \"I like the challenge,\" he says. \"I like the fact that everyone expects Watford to get promoted just because I am in charge. But I believe that it can be done. Actually the pressure drives me, and it's good for me.\" Oh yes, pressure. If Vialli never looked overburdened even while at Chelsea, his opposite number today has twice self-combusted under the stress of management. \"I'm very critical of myself, but I think that he's even more self-critical,\" says Vialli of Kevin Keegan. \"It is good in a way because it's nice when you expect the best from yourself. If it goes too far it can be a problem, but I'm sure that neither for myself or Kevin it goes too far. It's just the fact that we are never happy. We are two perfectionists and we always demand more, both from the team and ourselves.\" This season both are demanding promotion; this evening's game will provide the first pointer to the reality of their ambitions. Vialli could not have hoped for a tougher first test, but he is still expecting success. \"I'm quite positive and optimistic,\" he says. \"If you're going to get promoted you need to go to places like Maine Road and win. From my experience at Chelsea I know that when you've got quality players it's easier for them to perform in such a special place than when you go to the middle of nowhere in front of 1,000 supporters.\" We will learn a lot about Vialli, and indeed Keegan, over the course of this season. But first the two managers are looking forward to learning about each other. \"I've heard a lot about him,\" says Vialli, \"and I'm looking forward to shaking his hand before the match - and just telling him 'unlucky' after the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
