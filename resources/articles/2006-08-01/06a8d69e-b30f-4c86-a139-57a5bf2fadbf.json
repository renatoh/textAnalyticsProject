Gallagher showed him a yellow card for a clear red card offence. In November 2001 he was demoted for failing to send off Robbie Keane, then of Leeds United, for pushing David Beckham in the face in a game with Manchester United at Old Trafford. In 1998 he served a one-match ban after being faulted for his display in an Arsenal-Chelsea game. On Wednesday he also missed a blatant handball by Manchester City's Micah Richards. Gallagher, 49, passed the automatic retirement age but was granted a 12-month extension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
