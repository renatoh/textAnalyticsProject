There's Rock Of Gibraltar with Johannesburg, that's Hawk Wing, this one's Landseer, and here comes High Chaparral. As one gleaming piece of weaponry followed another, you knew how it would feel to take the salute on May Day in Beijing. The names that mattered most in the long line were Hawk Wing and High Chaparral, O'Brien's major contenders for the Derby on Saturday week. Both looked fit and ready for the most important date in their lives, when two minutes at Epsom will finally answer all the questions about their stamina and class. Less than a point separates them in the betting, with Hawk Wing the narrow favourite at 2-1, and even at this late stage O'Brien has no firm idea of the order in which they will finish. \"They're two very eligible horses,\" he said. \"High Chaparral has never run over further than a mile and a quarter but, being by Sadler's Wells, everybody always takes it for granted that he'll stay. \"But there's no doubt that you could have run him in a Guineas, he has that sort of pace, while Hawk Wing would probably have no problem coming back to a July Cup. \"But having said that, is it pushing the boat out to ask a horse that could run in a July Cup to get a mile and a half? His dam stayed a mile and a quarter, but obviously Woodman [Hawk Wing's sire] is an influence for speed, and that's where the big question mark is.\" As first lot warms down in a barn a few minutes later, the background noise is the banter and Europop of a local radio station. Strange as it seems, it is an example of the attention to detail that has made O'Brien the dominant force in European racing. They tried playing classical music to match the names like Bach and Mozart, but \"they never warmed to it\". So, back to the radio it was. Nothing is left to chance anywhere on Ballydoyle's 500 acres, set in the rolling hills of County Tipperary in the lush south-west of the Republic, and they have even created replicas of both the final furlong at Ascot and the sharp left turn at Tattenham Corner, which may prove decisive at Epsom. \"From the time that they're two, all the horses would canter around Tattenham Corner every work morning,\" O'Brien said. \"Just in case.\" Just in case: it would be the motto on an O'Brien coat of arms. No effort is too great or detail too small at Ballydoyle, as they try to turn young horses into new stallions for the Coolmore Stud a few miles away. Nor does he ever much worry about pitting stablemates against each other. O'Brien said yesterday that Louisville, who won his first and only race at the Curragh earlier this month, could join Hawk Wing and High Chaparral in the Derby field, although Rock Of Gibraltar, the English and Irish 2,000 Guineas winner, will run at Epsom only if he is forced to scratch one of his two prime contenders. \"I don't mind my horses taking each other on,\" he said. \"It's horses that people see racing consistently at the highest level that make the best stallions.\" And which of the Ballydoyle runners will Mick Kinane ride? \"I'll probably talk to him after they've done their last piece of work,\" O'Brien said. \"He always makes the best decision for the team.\" \u00b7 The attempt by the Jockey Club's former head of security Roger Buffham to have lifted the injunction against his involvement in a BBC Panorama investigation into racing stalled yesterday when a scheduled high court hearing was adjourned until Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
