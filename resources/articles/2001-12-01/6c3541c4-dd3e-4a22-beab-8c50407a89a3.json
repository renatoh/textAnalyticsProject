Four days before his 24th birthday Donald, born in High Wycombe but a graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago, had a final round of 69 in the tour qualifying school to win one of the cherished 36 cards. With rounds of 71, 71, 65, 68, 70, 69 he totalled 414 to be 18 under par and tied for 23rd alongside the 17-year-old Ted Tryon, who became the youngest player to qualify for the US tour. The event, held at Bear Lakes in Florida, was won by Pat Perez with 405, and among the others to get a card was Gary Nicklaus, a son of Jack, who tied for 13th place on 411. But Robert Gamez, a rookie sensation in 1990 when he won the first tournament he played on the US Tour and two months later won again, missed his card by one shot. Donald has been a professional for only 16 weeks, having stayed in the amateur ranks to take part in the Walker Cup in Georgia in August. By winning three of his four matches there, and taking his overall record to seven wins out of eight, he not only helped Great Britain and Ireland to successive wins for the first time but became the amateur with the best all-time record from these shores. But despite his desire to represent his country - and the fact that this quietly spoken young man has, after four years in America, retained his British accent - he has opted to play in America. In that he differs from Casey, who turned professional a year earlier after, like Donald, winning all four matches in the 1999 Walker Cup at Nairn. Casey, on the basis of his college achievements in America - he went to Arizona State University, as had Phil Mickelson - had expected to receive invitations to play US Tour events. But although he had beaten Mickelson's college stroke average he was ignored by sponsors and had to come to Europe, where he has made an enormous impact and won his first event, the Scottish Open at Gleneagles. Donald did manage seven invitations in the autumn of this season but won only $80,747 (\u00a357,000), well short of the amount needed to avoid going to the Q school. Now he has done it the hard way. \"It's what I've wanted my whole life. All the hard work I've put in over the years and I've finally made it,\" he said. He will soon discover, however, that \"making it\" involves a very much higher strike rate in terms of money won per tournament than he has so far managed. In order to keep his card he will have to win at least $400,000, which, at his current rate of earning, would mean playing in 35 tournaments next year - a mental if not physical impossibility. At least Donald will be able to play without the pressure of expectation that will be heaped on the teenage Tryon. This year he was invited to play in the Honda Classic, made the cut, finished in the top 30 and has since then been lionised. After five rounds at the qualifying school he was well down the field and estimated that he needed a six-under-par 66 to be sure of qualifying. But he was not on song in the early stages of his round and played indifferently for most of the front nine. His group were also playing slowly, falling behind the field, and were eventually put \"on the clock\" by officials,making his situation even more tense. Tryon responded by getting birdies at his next two holes, however, and then, at the long 12th, hit a three-iron second shot 227 yards into a stiff breeze. The ball finished 12ft from the flag, he holed the putt for an eagle, and after hitting a two-iron second 240 yards at the long 15th he birdied that hole at well. He had his 66 and qualified comfortably. \"He's got a lot of heart,\" said his father Bill, who had watched the whole thing. \"All he needs is someone to tell him he can't do it and it's as good as done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
