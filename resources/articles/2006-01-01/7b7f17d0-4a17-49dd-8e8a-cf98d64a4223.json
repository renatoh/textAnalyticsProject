The Daily Mail and rivals Daily Express and Daily Star all dropped their price by 10p to 30p this morning. \"I'm not sure it's enough,\" the executive said. \"A 20p [cover price] makes a huge difference but I'm not sure if 30p isn't a halfway house.\" The Daily Mail price cut appears to be a spoiler in reaction to a promotional campaign by the Daily Express, owned by Richard Desmond. But the Mail was not as generous to its readers as the Express, offering its price cut in London but making its readers in Manchester, the north of England and other regions pay full price. A 60-second television advertising campaign appeared throughout the day on Sunday to announce the price drop in a campaign that told readers what the paper stood for. In a front-page promotional box the Express today said it stood for \"traditions, progress, good manners and family fun\". \"The paper that stands for real values ... and gives you real value for money,\" the Express said. In December, Audit Bureau of Circulations data showed the Daily Express sales fell 1.76%, while sales the Daily Star went down by 3.01%. In contrast, a 20p cover price on Thursdays in December helped the London Evening Standard, owned by Associated Newspapers, to become the best-performing mid-market paper. Sales of the title rose 5.34% to 346,489. Sales of Associated's Daily Mail, which has cost 40p since 2000, edged down 0.39% to 2.34m. \"The problem with price cuts is it's never worked before because you have got to go up again,\" the Daily Mail executive said. \"It also damages the brand because it you are guilty of piling it high and selling it cheap.\" One analyst said the Sun and the Daily Mirror, which both cost 35p, would wait a few days to assess the impact of the lower prices before making any move. Any sustained price war would force publishers to abandon their huge investment in DVD giveaways, which will continue in January, a crucial month in which newspapers traditionally try to tempt readers back from holiday breaks with promotions and offers. Steve Goodman, the group press director at media buying agency MediaCom, said that if more than one newspaper dropped its cover price at the same time it cancelled out the benefits. \"If everyone discounts by a similar amount over the same period you don't tend to get readers trialling one paper as opposed to another,\" he said. But Mr Goodman said price cuts were preferable to DVD giveaways. \"As a method of introducing readers to trial a product I would much rather see that than free DVDs. Readers pick up titles just for the free promotion and don't even look at the product. \"The circulation spike that they cause is very short lived and goes straight back down the day after the promotion. \"We do have concerns these additional readers aren't really reading the product.\" Last year it appeared the newspaper price war was over when the Sun raised its cover price to 35p in November. The last great press price war took place in 2002 when the Daily Mirror slashed its cover price to 20p and the Sun retaliated by dropping to 10p in some regions. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
