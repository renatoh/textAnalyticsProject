We had peak kale \u2013 where it seemed there was not a restaurant menu, juice bar or cafe devoid of the cruciferous vegetable. Kale even turned up in cupcakes and biscuits. By year\u2019s end, everyone had learned how to pronounce quinoa. The protein-rich supergrain became a ubiquitous addition in salads, main meals and even breakfast cereals. While it is unlikely to be disappearing from our plates any time soon, foodies should make way for other hard-to-spell grains next year including freekeh, kamut, amaranth and teff. Of course paleo diet devotees will not have to worry as grains and bread are banned from their vocabulary \u2013 and mouths. The high-protein, low-carb diet reached fever pitch in 2014 with a stampede of followers keen to adopt the caveman-style diet (no matter that our ancient ancestors lived to an average age of 30). The Paleo Cafe, which was started in Cairns in 2012, now has outlets in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 with plans to open further franchisees across the country. Its menu includes a caveman big breakfast, and for lunch, grass-fed ribeye with roasted sweet potato chips and Greek salad. While paleo is predicted to eventually go the way of the Atkins diet, the same cannot be said for the gluten-free movement. It has spawned a food industry valued at $10bn in 2014 \u2013 and climbing \u2013 with 2016 predictions of sales of gluten-free to reach $16bn. Not only did supermarkets devote entire aisles to gluten-free products, but bar menus added icons next to gluten-free beers and restaurant chains including Dominoes and Hooters in the US, launched GF (gluten-free) menus. There was even the arrival of gluten-free dog food. While only a small percentage of Americans (around 1%) suffer coeliac disease and must eliminate gluten from their diet, about a quarter of the population quit it anyway, believing it will help them to lose weight and boost energy. \u201cIt really has become a thing, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away any time soon,\u201d chef Mark Ladner, from one of New York\u2019s top Italian restaurants, Del Posto, told the New York Times. As such he decided to embrace the craze and now offers gluten-free pasta in all the dishes, including Del Posto\u2019s famous 100-layer lasagna, and has just opened a gluten-free pasta pop-up in Manhattan called Pasta Flyer. Before you say goodbye to gluten and ask for a burger without the bun, nutritionists warn the regime does not guarantee weight loss and in fact many gluten-free products are very high in calories. Of course with the gluten-free devotees came an equal measure of gluten-free haters. A segment by late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel in which gluten-free converts in California were asked \u201cwhat is gluten\u201d (they had no idea) has attracted more than five million views on YouTube. Despite the swathe of people shunning gluten, pastries and artisan bread proved popular in 2014. In New York there was the birth of the cronut, and more recently the bruffin (a brioche muffin). Sales of artisan bread made with organic flour and no preservatives also rose, while in the world of dairy, Greek yoghurt and frozen yoghurt gained a loyal following, a trend that is likely to continue next year. Burrata, the rich gooey cousin of mozzarella, appeared on many menus in 2014 and by year\u2019s end waiters no longer had to answer: \u201cWhat\u2019s bur-rata?\u201d The delicacy from Puglia, the southern heel of Italy, turned up in many appetisers, in salads or served in the traditional way with Italian bread, olive oil and ripe tomatoes or eggplants. Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi serves it with clementine, coriander seeds and white balsamic vinegar at his London restaurant, Nopi. Asian hipster cuisine \u2013 think Peking duck burgers, Korean-style barbecue ribs and Chinese fried chicken \u2013 also made its mark this year, led by chefs David Chang of Momofuku fame, and Sydney\u2019s Dan Hong. At Ms G\u2019s in Sydney, the talented Hong adorns stir-fried Angus beef with fennel and chrysanthemum kimchi and warm tortillas. Other twists on tradition include sticky pigs tails and Vietnamese steak tartare prawn crackers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
