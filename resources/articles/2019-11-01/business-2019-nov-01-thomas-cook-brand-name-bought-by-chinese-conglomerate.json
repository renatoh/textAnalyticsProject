The deal, which also includes hotel brands Casa Cook and Cook\u2019s Club, gives Chinese group Fosun access to Thomas Cook trademarks, websites, social media accounts and software across most of the world. Fosun, which was Thomas Cook\u2019s largest shareholder and a key part of the failed rescue deal, owns a variety of businesses including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. Thomas Cook collapsed after running up huge debts as it expanded through takeovers amid stiff competition from online rivals. Its collapse triggered the largest ever peacetime repatriation to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers from overseas. The company\u2019s UK branch network was bought for \u00a36m by John and Irene Hays, who run Sunderland-based Hays Travel. The couple are rebranding the shops under the name of their family firm. Other parts of the company have continued to trade during the liquidation. Billionaire property tycoon Petter Stordalen led a deal this week to acquire Thomas Cook\u2019s Nordic business, also known as the Ving Group. It includes brands such as Globetrotter, Spies and Thomas Cook\u2019s Scandinavian airline. The brand name deal, announced on Friday, marked the final chapter in Fosun\u2019s approaches to Thomas Cook. Fosun was a key player in a proposed \u00a3900m bailout in August. It offered to inject hundreds of millions of pounds, but the deal fell through when the firm failed to secure further backing from other lenders or the government. Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 in Derbyshire by an eponymous cabinet-maker, who took his first customers 12 miles by train from Leicester to a temperance meeting in Loughborough. In its statement, Fosun described Thomas Cook as a \u201cpioneer of modern travel and one of the most well known tourism brands around the world\u201d. Qian Jiannong, Fosun\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThe group has always believed in the brand value of Thomas Cook. The acquisition of the Thomas Cook brand will enable the group to expand its tourism business, building on the extensive brand awareness of Thomas Cook and the robust growth momentum of Chinese outbound tourism.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
