Government figures revealed yesterday that the proportion of drivers exceeding the 30mph limit in free-flowing traffic on urban roads fell from 58% to 53% last year. The drop represented a sharpening of a steady decline in speeding since 1995, when the proportion of drivers exceeding limits in light traffic was 72%. Among motorcyclists, the incidence of speeding fell from 29% to 24%, and for heavy goods vehicle drivers from 53% to 49%. More than 5,200 cameras have been placed at accident blackspots, raising \u00a368m in fines annually. Critics, including the Conservatives, have suggested that their siting can be motivated by money-making. Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA Motoring Trust, said the fall was largely among marginal offenders who break the limit by a few miles per hour. He pointed out that the number of drivers exceeding 35mph in 30mph zones remained relatively unchanged. \"This could suggest that the more careful drivers, who strive to stay near the limit, are taking more care and driving within the law,\" Mr Howard said. \"If this is so, it could be the start of a long-awaited change in social attitudes to speeding.\" The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, has a target of cutting deaths and serious injuries on the roads by 40% within 10 years. Among long-distance drivers, speeding remains at a high level. The government figures suggested that 56% of cars on motorways and 48% of those on dual carriageways were still breaking the speed limit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
