For Sainz it represents a lifeline for his career after he parted company with Ford at the end of the last season. He tried the car on Monday, which is no small gesture by Citroen con sidering it costs \u00a34,000 per hour to run. \"Still nothing signed or decided but it is encouraging that at least I have been invited to drive the car,\" said Sainz. Citroen is the Spaniard's last roll of the dice. At 40 he is past his peak but remains a formidable competitor. A household name at home, he was world champion in 1990 and 1992 and his consistency is unsurpassed with a record 82 top-three finishes from 165 starts at world championship level. Tough economic circumstances undermined negotiations with Ford and Hyundai. While Citroen are keen to run him as well as McRae and the highly promising Frenchman Sebastien Loeb, they had originally planned to field two cars next season and are struggling to raise the money for a third. McRae and Sainz have an interesting past. They clashed bitterly when they were Subaru team-mates during McRae's successful title year in 1995. However, they have settled their differences and worked harmoniously at Ford. Sainz's stature could enable him to find sponsorship in Spain but he is no longer willing to predict whether he will contest the Monte Carlo Rally next month. If terms are agreed, Citroen are likely to pose the strongest threat to Peugeot, who have the largest driving squad, which includes Richard Burns and Marcus Gronholm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
