Portugal, playing with the fizz and freedom that was so markedly absent from their nervy opening defeat by Greece, won courtesy of a goal from midfielder Maniche after seven minutes and a late effort by substitute Rui Costa. \"The performance of the entire team was good,\" said Portugal's delighted Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. A poor Russian team had a player sent off for the second successive match, though the red card for goalkeeper Sergei Ovchinnikov at the end of the first half for handball just outside the penalty area seemed harsh. Russia's qualification hopes disappeared on the back of their ninth successive winless European Championship game - an unwelcome tournament record reaching back to the 1988 final. But while the Portugal fans went off into the Lisbon night full of cheer, the head-to-head qualification system means they will have to beat Spain in their final game in the same city on June 20 to reach the last eight. After Greece came back to draw 1-1 with Spain earlier today those teams have four points. Portugal have three and if they draw with Spain, Greece will go through thanks to their opening day 2-1 win - even if they lose against Russia. Asked about playing Spain, Scolari said: \"There isn't even time to imagine what's going to happen. Now, it's living this moment, talk a bit with the players review the tape, see where we made errors because Spain is a very worthy opponent.\" Wednesday's early result meant that effectively Portugal were playing knockout football from the kickoff against Russia. Scolari had reacted to their poor display against Greece by bringing in three new faces and one of them, Brazilian-born Deco, had an immediate impact. Brought in to replace stalwart Rui Costa in midfield, he fired in a low cross to the feet of Maniche and the Sporting Lisbon midfielder swivelled to shoot low past Ovchinnikov. The relief felt by the crowd and players was almost palpable after the suffering in Porto last Saturday, and the home side took control from then on. Deco sent a volley over the bar, Pauleta was inches away from connecting with a Henrik Larsson-style diving header and defender Ricardo Carvalho sent a header over the bar. Though they dropped the pace later in the half, the result was effectively decided in the 45th minute when Ovchinnikov raced from his line to face Pauleta as the forward chased an errant back pass. The keeper got a fair touch with his feet but, seemingly inadvertently, touched the loose ball with his arm and was shown an immediate red card by Norwegian referee Terje Hauge. But Portugal still found themselves forced to defend. Keeper Ricardo was happy to punch out a stinging shot by Andrei Karyaka 10 minutes after the restart and only a brilliant tackle by Carvalho denied Alexander Kerzhakov a clear path to goal. The scares seemed to spark Portugal into life and Luis Figo thought he had scored when he finished of a superb passing move with a firm low shot only for substitute keeper Vyacheslav Malafeyev to brilliantly touch it on to a post. Other chances came and went, with the occasional Russian breakaway keeping the fans on the edge their seats. But Rui Costa finally made sure of victory when he knocked the ball home after a clever cross with the outside of his foot by fellow substitute Cristiano Ronaldo in the 89th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
