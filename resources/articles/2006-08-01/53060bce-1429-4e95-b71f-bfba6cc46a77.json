What can I take to help me digest it better? Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the milk sugar, lactose. Lots of adults have some lactose intolerance by the time they reach their twenties. Yours is simply more extreme. This is not the same as a milk allergy where milk can be digested but then causes problems with the immune system, but is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lactase. The symptoms, which usually start up to two hours after eating dairy, can include excess gas, diarrhoea and stomach cramping and are the result of undigested lactose fermenting in the colon. The solution is to cut back on your dairy but if you must have cheese, then use Biocare's Liquid Lactase Enzyme to help the body better break down lactose. It costs \u00a310.05 for 15ml and is available by mail order on 0121 433 3727; www.biocare.co.uk. I am looking for a natural product to help whiten my teeth. I don't like the thought of the chemicals that appear in some tooth-whitening toothpastes. Is there anything that works? Dental Miracle is an all-natural, stain-removing powder that truthfully, will not whiten your teeth the way bleaching would, but will help prevent further discoloration and keep the gums healthy into the bargain too. Made from six different herbs, including juniper berries, peppermint, aloe vera and orris root, it contains no harsh abrasives, no artificial colours or flavours, no sweeteners and no preservatives and so it is something of an acquired taste. To use it, you simply apply your normal toothpaste to your brush and then dip the brush and paste, without using water, in the green herbal powder. Clean the teeth, gums and tongue with this dry mix before rinsing with water. Dental Miracle costs \u00a317.99 for 9g, which will last several months, and is available from Victoria Health (0800 413596; www.victoriahealth.com). It can also help tackle halitosis and plaque build-up. My husband has just recovered from treatment to get rid of a kidney stone. He is anxious not to get another one. What advice can you give him? One of the more fascinating aspects about reporting on natural health has been discovering that traditional healers often identified their remedies according to something that is known as 'the signature of plants'. The remedy I am going to recommend for your husband is a rainforest plant called Quebra Pedra which means stone-breaker. I saw for myself the signature of these plants in action in the Amazon, struggling to grow up through a stony patch of river bank. Quebra Pedra has both anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic properties and so is useful for anyone who is still suffering from painful kidney stones, as well as those who want to avoid getting another one. To prevent further stones, use Quebra Pedra in supplement form (\u00a315.99 for 90 veggie capsules; take as directed on the bottle). To help eliminate existing stones use this herb in tea form. You can either use ready-made tea bags (\u00a35.99 for 40) or buy the loose tea (\u00a312.99 for 150g) to make your own brew which you can sweeten with honey. Drink this tea three times a day to get rid of a stone and once a day to help stop recurrence. All three Quebra Pedra remedies are available from rainforest herbal specialists Rio Trading on 01273 570987; www.riohealth.co.uk. I suffer from endometriosis. I know I can't get rid of it but would like advice on coping with the pain and what to do to stop it from getting worse. The herb, saw palmetto, which is more commonly used to help support prostate health in men, can work in the body to block the action of the sex hormone FSH - follicle stimulating hormone - which increases endometrial tissue. To help alleviate the more painful symptoms, investigate the use of essential fatty acids since these produce natural anti-inflammatory substances called prostaglandins which can then help counter the inflammation which is causing the pain. This is a serious and painful condition which is not something to try and self-treat. Find a natural health practitioner who has experience with this condition and who will be able to monitor your progress. I recommend a naturopathic approach with a practitioner qualified to draw from a wide range of disciplines, including homeopathy, herbalism, nutrition and detoxification techniques to tailor a treatment regimen specifically for you. The British Naturopathic Association (01458 840072; www.naturopathy.org.uk) offers free referrals to practitioners working in your area. \u00b7 Before following any medical or dietary advice in this column, please consult your GP if you suffer from any health problems.
