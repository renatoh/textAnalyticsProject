It would have been in the past \u2013 imagine a 0-0 draw between Sam Allardyce and Tony Pulis \u2013 but these two improving sides are far less functional these days. There was an agreeably mellow mood around Upton Park at the end of a compelling contest and Slaven Bilic and Mark Hughes both had reasons to feel pleased; the former because of the way West Ham coped without five key players, the latter with a performance that was a demonstration of Stoke\u2019s brawn and brains combination. This was Stoke\u2019s seventh clean sheet in their past nine matches and West Ham\u2019s second in a week but there was little negativity. Bilic and Hughes both made daring substitutions in the second half. Bilic weakened his midfield by replacing Alex Song and Michail Antonio with Enner Valencia and Nikica Jelavic while Hughes bolstered his attack by bringing on Mame Biram Diouf and Jonathan Walters. \u201cBit risky but we wanted to win the game,\u201d Bilic said. The teams played in bursts. Missing the hamstrung Winston Reid, West Ham\u2019s defence was jittery during the opening 30 minutes and Marco van Ginkel and Marko Arnautovic were guilty of glaring misses. Yet West Ham enjoyed sustained spells of pressure and, while there was relief when Adri\u00e1n made two late saves to deny Diouf, the hosts tested Jack Butland on several occasions and had two efforts cleared off the line in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Bilic was asked if he is worried about West Ham\u2019s run of six matches without a win. \u201cIt\u2019s not a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be concerned, and it\u2019s the point where a manager should be concerned, if the team is not playing well. In these six games I wasn\u2019t happy with the way of playing against Watford or against Spurs but the last four draws we could have won a few of them.\u201d There were imperfections, such as the moment when Andy Carroll turned away from Erik Pieters on the right and skewed a cross behind for a goal-kick. However, there was plenty to enjoy. Stoke were missing Xherdan Shaqiri because of a hamstring injury but Ibrahim Afellay was outstanding on the right of their front three in the first half, while Ryan Shawcross and Philipp Wollscheid were strong in central defence. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly like them as a player but I love them as a manager,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe had opportunities to win today and it\u2019s frustrating we didn\u2019t take them.\u201d The disappointment for Stoke was that they fell below the heights of last weekend\u2019s victory over Manchester City and Geoff Cameron tweaked a hamstring in the second half. Afellay faded while Bojan Krkic and Arnautovic were quiet. It was a decent point for West Ham, who were missing Manuel Laznini, Victor Moses, Dimitri Payet and Diafra Sakho. Bilic hopes Lanzini will be back for Sunday\u2019s trip to Swansea City and he hinted that Payet could return from his ankle injury ahead of schedule. West Ham\u2019s injury problems have been blamed on the hard pitches at their Chadwell Heath training ground and they move to their new site in Rush Green on Monday. Bilic hopes it will be another step in the right direction. Man of the match Ibrahim Afellay (Stoke City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
