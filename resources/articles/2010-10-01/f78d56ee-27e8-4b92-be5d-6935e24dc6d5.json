Less than a month after saying he intended to add to his 73 England caps Vickery ended his career by saying that after four operations on his neck and back \u2013 to go with repair work on a shattered forearm as well as a fractured eye socket \u2013 he would not have another after injuring his neck again playing for Wasps at Gloucester a month ago. \"It was just a hit, a big hit that caught me and knocked me down,\" Vickery said. \"I was all right. There was a bit of a stinger and stuff and I know it sounds weird but that's normal. You just get up and get on with it.\" He was being watched on the day by his wife and family, who had been given a box at the club where he played for 10 years before moving on to Wasps in 2006. Initially the damage to one of the vertebrae high in his neck was masked by the onset of shingles \u2013 an adult version of chickenpox \u2013 but once the virus went away Vickery knew something else was wrong. \"We knew there were some other bits and pieces as well. I knew things weren't right this time. The pain levels were different,\" he said, a view shared by Richard Nelson, the consultant neurosurgeon who had worked with Vickery before. \"Before he had just said fine, we can do this or that and get back. He just tells it like it is but this time it's different. It's not we can do this or that or that it will be six months. He said: 'Look Phil, total respect to you, but not this time.' \"It was a combination of a lot of things but this time it was the medical guys saying enough's enough. I could have been pig-headed as I normally am but all I know is that I can't carry on like this. I sneezed earlier on and I thought I'd been stabbed in the back of the head.\" Vickery's decision, announced yesterday at an emotional press conference where the 34-year-old admitted he was close to tears, ends a career which started at Bude, progressed through Redruth to Gloucester and an England debut against Australia at the age of 21.He captained England to the final of the last World Cup, made 13 appearances for the Lions and won a Heineken Cup and a Premiership title in his first season with Wasps. However, yesterday's decision means that all three of the front row that helped England win the World Cup in 2003 have since retired with neck and back problems, although the hooker Steve Thompson restarted his career in France and is in the England squad preparing to play the All Blacks next week. Trevor Woodman, loose-head prop in the 2003 final and now the forwards coach at Wasps, was in the audience to hear Vickery say: \"I'm not afraid of fighting back or proving people wrong but there comes a stage when you have to listen and trust the experts.\" For England, Vickery's departure denies Martin Johnson an experienced back-up going into the autumn international series next month but the reservoir of English props is much fuller now than it was ayear ago. The England manager has Leicester's Dan Cole as his established tighthead, with Davey Wilson of Bath in contention, while Gloucester's Paul Doran-Jones, rated by both Vickery and the England management, understudies Sale's Andrew Sheridan at loosehead. For Wasps, though, it is another blow for a club that is struggling after losing a remarkable array of talent in recent seasons. To Vickery one can add the names ofan impressive list of internationals including Lawrence Dallaglio, Josh Lewsey, Danny Cipriani, Stuart Abbott, James Haskell, Paul Sackey, Tom Palmer, Eoin Reddan, Rapha\u00ebl Iba\u00f1ez, Alex King and Fraser Waters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
