Officials in El Paso, Texas, said that the detention of the woman moments after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents watched a judge grant her a protective order was an alarming development that had sent shockwaves through the community. The woman has been a victim of violence by her partner on at least three occasions, has filed three police reports and endured punching, kicking, choking and having a knife thrown at her, Jo Anne Bernal, the El Paso county attorney, said on a conference call with reporters. As the protective order was granted on 9 February, Bernal said, an Ice agent sat through the proceedings in the courtroom. Two federal agents were placed at exits, she said. After the end of the hearing, agents escorted the woman from the courtroom area on the 10th floor and out of the building. She is presently in the county jail. \u201cNone of us can recall an incident where immigration authorities made their presence known inside a courtroom in this courthouse, and especially not in a courtroom that is reserved for victims of domestic violence,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cWe need to be very firm in our voice: the courthouse is not a place for enforcement of immigration law, the courthouse is a place where victims of domestic violence come for protection.\u201d Jaime Esparza, the local district attorney, said: \u201cThey came into the courthouse and I think it sends a horrible message to victims of domestic violence on whether or not they\u2019re actually going to have the ability to seek justice in our courthouse.\u201d Michelle Ortiz, deputy director of Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Florida-based group, said such arrests threatened to undo decades of bridge-building work between immigrant communities, their supporters, and law enforcement. \u201cEnforcement action like this one, I mean, it takes us back 30 years and it\u2019s terrifying because we do so much outreach and community events with law enforcement trying to get the word out that this is safe, and in your home country it might not be safe, and in your home country there is corruption and there is law enforcement that does not care about domestic violence and is not going to protect women \u2013 but you\u2019re in the United States now, where everyone is protected regardless of immigration status,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really afraid that we won\u2019t be able to say that any more. It\u2019s disheartening and frankly it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d \u201cIt will make our communities less safe because it will make immigrants afraid to come forward to report crime,\u201d said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of Raices, a Texas-based immigrant legal aid group. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with undocumented victims of domestic violence for 30 years. They\u2019re always afraid to come forward because their entire life has reaffirmed that they should fear authority, that they should fear men, and they don\u2019t have rights. That\u2019s the process by which they have become so chronically abused and these stories feed into what is already a long-term pervasive narrative among survivors of violence, that no one cares about them.\u201d El Paso, a city of about 675,000 in far west Texas, borders the bigger Mexican city of Ju\u00e1rez and has a large undocumented population. County officials suspect Ice acted on a tip-off from her alleged abuser, since he was the only other person given written notice of the hearing. But in a statement, Ice said that the woman was arrested on a felony charge of illegally re-entering the US \u201cafter receiving a tip from another law enforcement agency indicating that a previously deported felon had illegally re-entered the United States\u201d. According to Ice\u2019s criminal complaint, reported by the El Paso Times, the woman is a Mexican citizen who has been deported repeatedly and has a criminal history. It says that Ice agents were \u201cconducting surveillance\u201d at the courthouse \u201cin attempts of seeing\u201d her, then took the woman into custody when she walked out. Bernal said that video footage indicated that her detention began inside the building. Nearly 700 people were detained last week in a series of Ice operations in cities from Los Angeles to New York, homeland security secretary John Kelly said in a statement on Monday. Many did not have criminal convictions and appeared to have been picked up by officials initially seeking someone else, adding to alarm among advocates who are worried that the government is now pursuing a less targeted strategy than under Barack Obama. While his administration deported large numbers of unauthorised immigrants, Obama pledged that \u201cfelons, not families\u201d would be the priority. Last week, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two who was convicted of using a fake social security number in 2008, went to a regularly scheduled meeting with immigration officials in Phoenix, Arizona, and was detained, then deported. Agents had previously allowed her to remain in the country under supervision. \u201cWe are hoping that this is an isolated incident,\u201d Bernal, the El Paso county attorney, said. \u201cWe are fearful that it is not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
