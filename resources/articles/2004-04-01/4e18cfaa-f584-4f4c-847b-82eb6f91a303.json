Chelsea showed a lot of quality but also lots and lots of energy, and nobody summed that up better than Scott Parker and Frank Lampard. They were phenomenal in the way they dictated the game and got about the pitch. They were getting back into defensive areas to protect the back four, then running the length of the field into Tottenham's penalty area. Arsenal's midfield will have their work cut out if Chelsea play with that work ethic and positive attitude, and I expect more of the same from Claudio Ranieri's side because they have to win at Highbury or get a high-scoring draw. I know Tottenham are a bit milky and flimsy but Chelsea impressed me. They looked bright, lively and very assertive. All through the team they were energetic and up for it. I think they've got a very good chance tomorrow, particularly if Arsenal want a slow tempo game because they won't allow that. One move highlighted a lot of what Chelsea are doing. It went from one end of the field to the other, showing how well-organised they are defensively and how quickly they can create chances on the counter-attack. It was noticeable in the build-up to the move why Chelsea aren't giving goals away. The back four was between the width of the goal, which is what you want, and Lampard, Parker and Claude Makelele were protecting them. Once Stephen Carr's cross had ended up at Parker's feet, Chelsea went the length of the pitch at high speed and with high-quality football. Parker ran with the ball at his feet, exchanged passes with Eidur Gudjohnsen and got himself into the box. All the while, Lampard was bursting a blood vessel to get into the area, and did well to get the distance and have a shot. Parker was basically played on the right but popped up everywhere. Against Arsenal he will have to hold that right-hand position a bit more because of the threat of Robert Pires and Thierry Henry, but I like the balance in this Chelsea side. Damien Duff's coming back to his best, and Gudjohnsen and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink looked as good a pair as they did a couple of years ago. Against Arsenal, I hope the Tinkerman doesn't tinker with the side that started at Spurs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
