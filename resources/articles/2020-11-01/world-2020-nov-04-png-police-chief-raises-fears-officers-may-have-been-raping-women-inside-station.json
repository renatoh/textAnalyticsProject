The woman was allegedly raped by a policeman earlier this year. Two officers have been charged over the alleged assault. Robert Ali, the director of PNG police\u2019s internal investigation unit at that time of the alleged assault in March, said he was aware of the report of the alleged incident and confirmed the two officers\u2019 cases were before the courts. The case has not yet gone to trial, delayed by Covid-19, and the officers have not yet entered pleas. Ali said that he could not confirm or deny other alleged instances inside the police station were under investigation. A Milne Bay resident who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said she believed assaults had been occurring for years and that perpetrators escaped prosecution because rape was seen as a taboo topic in conservative, deeply religious, PNG society. \u201cNo woman would come forward and say she was raped, because sadly, society would look at her differently, they would blame her and even, sometimes, this destroys their marriages, and husbands instead of supporting their wives to seek justice, divorce them out of shame that she was raped.\u201d \u201cA couple of us have tried to get this out, we\u2019ve helped to lay complaints at the Alotau police station and when there was no response, we sent a report down to the police headquarters in Port Moresby, and also sent a report to the police internal investigation unit\u2026 but most times, nothing comes out of it,\u201d the source said. Unrelated to alleged offences in Alotau Town, PNG\u2019s reformist police minister Bryan Kramer made an extraordinary condemnation of his own force last month, alleging the police force was the most corrupt public agency in the country, engaged in drug-smuggling, gun-running, land theft and criminal violence. \u201cI found our police force in complete disarray and riddled with corruption\u2026 add to that a rampant culture of police ill-discipline and brutality,\u201d Kramer wrote about his first 15 months as police minister. PNG\u2019s police commissioner David Manning, has also conceded his force includes \u201ccriminals in uniform\u201d. Alotau Town has been seized by unrest and criminal violence in recent years, including attacks on police by armed gangs, and riots after visiting policemen killed pedestrians in a road accident. Milne Bay commander Barkie urged women who had been assaulted to lay complaints with the police. \u201cOne who did come forward\u2026, I asked her to write a statement but she didn\u2019t want to and instead wanted to remain anonymous to protect her marriage, she was afraid her husband would leave her if he knew she was raped, so it\u2019s quite sad, I can\u2019t help them if they won\u2019t lay a report or tell me about it,\u201d he said. Barkie said he was working to reform the culture and practices at the station and across Milne Bay. In his three-month term as commander, four officers had been dismissed and charged over allegations of rape, murder and theft. A further eight officers have been charged with serious disciplinary offences. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve still got a long list pending. It\u2019s a difficult thing to do, to take disciplinary actions against your own men or having them charged criminally, but [if] they have stepped out of line [they] have to be held accountable. \u201cSomeone has to do it, we have to make a stand, if we are to restore... the public\u2019s faith in the constabulary,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
