That's because it doesn't just involve government bureaucrats or angry programmers, but children's education. Becta, the organisation that liaises between the technology industry and British schools, this week made an official complaint to the Office of Fair Trading, accusing Microsoft of hampering competitive practice in its dealings with the education system. The problem, it seems, is that the terms and conditions for schools using Microsoft programs are considered too restrictive. Becta believes that they often act against the best interests of schools, meaning that sometimes headteachers are paying for software they don't want - or even that they are prevented from using competing programs. The result, says Becta official Bob Fenton, is that the possible choices for schools can be severely limited while strengthening Microsoft's hand. \"Schools are obliged legally to make sure they are properly licensed, but they should look at how they are doing it - whether they are paying for one-off licenses, annual subscriptions and so forth,\" he told Technology Guardian. \"You could have a situation where schools are paying for licences on software they aren't even using.\" The two groups have been locked in negotiations since a pair of reports from Becta in January investigating Office 2007 and Vista, but without any satisfactory progress the group said it had no choice but to approach the OFT. Microsoft made an official response to the news, but has refused to make any further comment. \"At this early stage, no indication has been given as to how this issue will progress,\" the company said. \"We want to reassure our customers, partners and the education sector that it is business as usual.\" Although OFT investigations rarely move at lightning pace, it seems unlikely that the complaint will take as long to process as the battle between Microsoft and the European Commission. That war seems to be drawing to a close, as the software giant last week finally agreed to comply with an EU anti-trust ruling after nine years of fighting. Becta said that it remained optimistic. \"Schools are not organisations awash with cash, and we believe there's a valid complaint: we hope Microsoft will move,\" said Fenton. \"It's not a step we've taken lightly - you don't do something like this without thinking very hard about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
