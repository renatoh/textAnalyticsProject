The study found that in the coming years nearly all sports \u2013 from cricket to American football, tennis to athletics, surfing to golf \u2013 will face serious disruption from heatwaves, fires, floods and rising sea levels. It also estimated that globally, sports\u2019 own carbon emissions are equal to that of a medium-sized country, adding that sport administrators and stars had an important role to play in global efforts to tackle climate breakdown. Andrew Simms, the co-ordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said: \u201cSport provides some of society\u2019s most influential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow.\u201d The report found that in the next three decades a quarter of English league football grounds will be at risk of flooding every season, one in three British golf courses will be damaged by rising sea levels and the Winter Olympics will be increasingly difficult to stage because of rising temperatures. It also highlighted how the climate crisis was already having an impact on major sports events. Last year\u2019s Rugby World Cup was hit by a huge typhoon, while this year\u2019s Australian Tennis open was disrupted by toxic smoke from the country\u2019s devastating bush fires. Commenting on the findings, Rosie Rogers, the head of Green Recovery at Greenpeace, said: \u201cFrom flooding to sweltering heat, even sport can\u2019t escape the climate emergency. But it\u2019s also clear that the sector is playing a part in fuelling it.\u201d As it re-emerged from the Covid-19 lockdown the industry had a chance to think about how to do things differently and what a \u201csporting green recovery\u201d would look like, she said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s switching planes for trains, ditching single use plastic or cutting fossil fuel sponsorship, sport can show it\u2019s on the winning side as we take the climate crisis head on.\u201d The study found that of hundreds of governing bodies, only five have a zero carbon pledge, with World Athletics, Formula 1 motor racing and the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs Wimbledon, having pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030. The report\u2019s author, David Goldblatt, said sport should be doing much more. \u201cFew human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport. Making a carbon-zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics.\u201d Jens Sejer Andersen, the international director of Play the Game, the global organisation for good governance in sport, said the report underlined the need for the industry to take a lead in the fight against climate breakdown. \u201cWe must be ready to revise the ways we organise our events and tasks \u2026 But we won\u2019t stop here. Climate action must be an essential part of sports governance.\u201d He said the climate crisis would be a central topic at the organisation\u2019s next international conference in 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to engage our global network of reporters, sport leaders, athletes and officials in raising their game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
