Stan Ternent's team, who only 12 months ago produced a similar late burst to secure promotion from the Second Division, trailed to Steve Yates's 20th-minute goal before an own-goal from the same player and a second-half strike from John Mullin kept their improbable dream alive. It will still take an unlikely sequence of events for Burnley to make the play-offs but a six-match unbeaten run has established them as the team most likely to capitalise on any slip-ups by Preston or Birmingham City. \"We've given ourselves a chance, albeit a slim one,\" Ternent said. \"The other teams will be looking over their shoulders because we're on the charge.\" But Burnley suffered a blow yesterday when Ternent reluctantly ended his attempt to extend Gareth Taylor's loan spell from Manchester City for a third month. The striker has done much to inspire Burnley's run but the Burnley manager was not prepared to meet City's asking price. \"I still want to sign Gareth on a permanent basis in the summer but unfortunately there was no way we could extend the loan,\" Ternent said. \"I'm dis appointed with City but I couldn't justify giving them an exorbitant fee when we might only have him for three matches.\" Burnley had fallen behind when Yates punished some slack defending to put the visitors ahead. But the game changed when the defender helped in a shot from the former Tranmere forward Ian Moore. Mullin, hitherto anonymous as Taylor's stand-in, settled matters on the hour with a well-struck shot after good work from Glen Little. After the substitute Andy Payton twice went close, Burnley's nerves began to show in the final stages. Tranmere had Jason Koumas sent off in the 88th minute for a second bookable offence but would have sneaked a point in stoppage time had Nik Michopoulos not pulled off a fine save to deny Scott Taylor. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
