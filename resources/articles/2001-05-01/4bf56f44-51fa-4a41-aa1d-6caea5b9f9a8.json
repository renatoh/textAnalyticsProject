True or false? The straight answer is: government revenues from taxing fuel have risen since May 1997 but less \"significantly\" than during the 90s when the Tories were in power. At the end of March the \"real\" cost of petrol was 16.88p a litre. Fuel duty added 46.82p. From the government's point of view it is a vital tax. Net receipts from hydrocarbon oil duties rose from \u00a319.5bn in 1997-98 to an estimated \u00a322.5bn this financial year - though the tax take now represents a smaller proportion of national income. But the tax take jumped most between 1993 and 1996, when Kenneth Clarke was chancellor. So Tony Blair was right to call the Tories \"opportunistic\"? The fuel duty escalator - a commitment to raise the duty on fuel each year by more than inflation - is a Tory tax. It was invented by Norman Lamont in March 1993 as part of the Major government's effort to meet international agreements on climate change. Gordon Brown took it over with zest but then abolished it from spring 2000. In the latest budget he froze duty rates on all fuels till April 2002. Had Labour not kept the fuel escalator, it would have foregone nearly \u00a310bn in revenues in 1999-2000. It's not the only tax on motoring, is it? As well as fuel duty, motorists pay VAT, which currently brings in 11.15p a litre of unleaded. So how come the real cost of motoring has remained broadly stable in recent years? If petrol and insurance and tax have all risen yet total motoring costs are the same now as they were in the 80s, the explanation is that the cost of buying a car has fallen significantly - in fact by more than 25% in real terms. How do we compare? UK motorists pay more for their petrol than elsewhere. As of April 30, a litre of premium unleaded cost 77p in the UK, 1p less in the Netherlands but 18p less in Austria. When John Major won the 1992 election, Austrians were paying 5p a litre more than Britons. The EU average is 69p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
