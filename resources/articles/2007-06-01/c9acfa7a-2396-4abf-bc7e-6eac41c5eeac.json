Those union throwbacks are misguided; we are not so different from other branches of finance. For normal people, they get rather special salaries. It was reported yesterday that Stephen Schwarzman, private equity superstar and boss of the US firm Blackstone, was paid $398m (\u00a3199m) last year and should get at least $450m when his company floats on the stockmarket in the next few weeks. After all, like the rest of us, Mr Schwarzman could use some spending money for his summer holidays. This argument over how normal private equity really is - the practice of buying companies on credit then selling them at a profit - will get a useful airing over coming weeks. That is thanks to the Treasury select committee, which begins hearings this morning for its inquiry into the industry. For the first time, the backroom boys will come under major public scrutiny. The usual jibe about private equity is that it lives up to its name all too well. Two things have changed that: increasing public pressure, and especially the \u00a311bn takeover of Boots - with its 2,600 high-street outlets, 85,000 UK employees and vital importance to the NHS. Now, as one senior Labour backbencher says, private equity \"has been brought blinking into the bright lights of the public arena\". One area MPs will consider is the impact of making a company private. Here, the evidence is mixed. Do buyouts create jobs? Yes, where led by a management already in place - but only in small numbers. When outside buyers take over, workers lose jobs and pay. Does private equity encourage better management? Any number of academic papers could be quoted, but better is this recent comment by one leading privateer, Jon Moulton of Alchemy Partners: \"As an industry we are only barely able to demonstrate that we are superior at managing companies compared to the public markets.\" So: nothing special. Why, then, does the industry enjoy such generous tax breaks? That question was raised most forcefully last week, not by some hopeful for the Labour deputy leadership rediscovering the old religion, but by another industry bigwig, Nick Ferguson: \"A highly paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady ... can't be right.\" One big break privateers enjoy was brought in, not by some retrograde Tory, but by Gordon Brown. He now taxes gains on investments made by private equity at a minimum rate of only 10%. This was meant to encourage entrepreneurs; instead it's spurred financiers to fill their boots. It is time to close that break. If they want to be treated as normal, private equity businessmen should not get special treatment on tax."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
