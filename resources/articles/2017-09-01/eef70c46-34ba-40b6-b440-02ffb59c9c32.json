Every five years the ABS examines how much and on what we spend each week. As the latest household income and wealth data released yesterday revealed, incomes have generally fallen in the past two years and have been flat over the past five years. The stagnant real income growth has seen households shift their spending priorities away from luxuries and discretionary items. In 2015-16, the biggest spending category for average households was housing costs \u2013 which include rent, mortgage interest payments, rates, home and content insurance and repairs and maintenance. Australian households on average spent $279 a week on those costs, well in front of the $237 a week spent on the second-largest category of food and non-alcoholic beverages. The third-biggest spending category was transport \u2013 costing $207 a week on average. As has been the case since the early 1990s, spending on tobacco was the lowest category \u2013 just $12.84 on average a week is spent. Such a figure reveals of course the limitations of \u201caverage spending\u201d. A 25 pack of cigarettes will set you back between $28 and $35 depending on the brand, so clearly if you are still a smoker, you spend a lot more than $12.84 a week. But these figures attempt to paint a picture of Australian households in general and inform the calculations of the quarterly inflation figures. While housing costs are the biggest category, the area of spending that has risen the most in the past five years is education \u2013 the average of $43.86 spent each week is 44% more than was the case five years ago. Of the broad categories, only the average amount spent on tobacco and clothing have fallen \u2013 reflecting the continuing decline in the number of people who smoke and the fall in the price of clothing since 2009-10: But nominal amounts spent on items doesn\u2019t tell us a hell of a lot. What is more interesting is the breakdown of spending over time and across different households. The ABS figures highlight just how much Australian households have shifted their spending towards essential items. In 2015-16, households on average spent 59.4% of their weekly budget on housing, food, fuel and power, medical and healthcare, and transport \u2013 up from 56.2% at the turn of the century: When broken down into broad categories, we can see that households on average spent 19.6% of their weekly spending on housing costs \u2013 up from 18% five years ago. Similarly, the large increase in the nominal spending on education has also seen the share of that spending grow from 2.5% to 3.1%: While spending on tobacco has fallen over the years, so too has the share we have spent on alcohol. Back in the 1980s, Australian households on average spent 3.4% of their weekly budget on alcohol \u2013 in 2015-16 it was down to a record low share of just 2.2%. While there was a slight increase in the share of weekly spending spent on food and non-alcoholic drinks, on this as well we spend a lot less of our budget than we did in the past. In the 1980s, households spent 19.7% of their budget on food and drinks, now it is just 16.6%. One of the biggest growth categories is medical care and health expenditures \u2013 in the 1980s we spent 3.9% of our weekly spending on medical care, now that is up to 5.8%. That isn\u2019t surprising given the aging population. Households with the main resident aged between 15 and 24 spent just 2.5% on average on medical care, compared with 8.3% by households with those aged 65-74: Younger households also spend a greater share on communication than older ones, but lest we think such young people are flinging their money around on the latest phone, they also spend a greater share of their weekly budget on housing costs compared with households with residents aged over 45. The survey also shows how income affects spending, with the poorest 20% of households spending much more of their budget on housing costs, food and drinks, and fuel and power than other households. The poorest 20% of households spend 47% of their weekly budget on those three categories compared with 40.2% by median-income households and just 34.4% by the richest 20% of households: Not surprisingly, this difference is echoed in spending by those who gain most of their income from private sources compared with those who are reliant upon government pensions and allowances: The survey also reveals that those households suffering from over-indebtedness spend much more of their income on housing costs compared with other households. Such over-indebted households spend 24% of their budget on housing costs compared with just 17% for those households with a mortgage but who are not over-indebted: But while households have become more in debt, they have not become more subject to financial stress. The survey found that 15% of Australian households (approximately 1.3 million) experienced four or more indicators of financial stress within 2015-16 \u2013 slightly down on 2009-10. The ABS suggests a main reason financial stress has not increased in line with increased debt is the ageing population. Households in financial stress tend to be younger, and similarly are more likely to have dependent children and be renting \u2013 two aspects that are more likely to be those of younger households than older ones. The latest household spending survey confirms flat income growth has had a big impact on our spending habits. With real wages flat over the past four years households have shifted their spending from luxuries to essentials with households now spending more of their budget on housing costs and education than ever before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
