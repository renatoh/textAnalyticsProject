But the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has defended the prime minister, describing his as the \u201cpurest donation of all\u201d because there could be no suggestion the money bought influence from the government. On Wednesday evening Turnbull confirmed he had given $1.75m to the Liberal party, explaining that he had made the \u201csignificant contribution\u201d to ensure that Labor was not elected at the July double dissolution. On Thursday at a press conference in Melbourne, Turnbull said the $1.75m donation was the largest he had made to the party and added it was \u201cmy after tax money\u201d, clarifying he will not claim a deduction for it. He said he had \u201cput his money where his mouth is\u201d to demonstrate he \u201ccan\u2019t be bought by anyone\u201d. Turnbull claimed the Coalition was \u201cmassively outspent in the election campaign\u201d by Labor, the unions and activist organisations like Get Up. \u201cThey had a big financial advantage and I\u2019m proud to be able to say that I\u2019m my own man. I can\u2019t be bought. I don\u2019t belong to anybody.\u201d Earlier on Thursday Jim Chalmers, the Labor finance spokesman, said it was \u201cno wonder\u201d Turnbull had wanted to keep the figure secret because it showed he had \u201cbasically bought himself an election\u201d. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t rely on the power of his arguments or his policies to win the election \u2013 he had to buy it.\u201d Chalmers claimed Turnbull wouldn\u2019t be Liberal leader or prime minister \u201cif he didn\u2019t have $1.75m in his back pocket\u201d. Tanya Plibersek, the deputy Labor leader, told ABC News24 the Liberal party would have used the $1.75m on \u201cslick advertising\u201d and \u201cdirect voter contact\u201d rather than relying on its ideas and record to win. Asked if the donation really made the difference, Plibersek observed that Labor \u201ccame pretty close\u201d. \u201cWe were within about 12,000 votes across the different marginal seats of forming government,\u201d she said, adding it was up to the people to decide what effect the $1.75m had on the close contest. On ABC News Breakfast, Frydenberg defended Turnbull, dismissing the suggestion he wouldn\u2019t be prime minister without the donation and he must be angry the party didn\u2019t show more gratitude. \u201cNo, look, the point is the prime minister has made this donation public. \u201cHe\u2019s abided by all of the rules and the hypocrisy of the Labor party who receive millions of dollars from the union movement, which in fact does determine their policy positions, is \u2013 they are the ones that have the case to answer.\u201d Frydenberg tried to turn the donation into a positive, arguing: \u201cThere is no inference of influence when a person makes a donation to their own campaign. In fact, it is the purest donation of all.\u201d He also noted that opposition leader, Bill Shorten, had received a $40,000 donation from a construction labour hire company, which he only declared when it was discovered by the trade union royal commission. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, hit back at Chalmers in an interview with Radio National, labelling the claim Turnbull had \u201cbought\u201d the election a \u201cgrubby political smear\u201d from a \u201cpolitical hack\u201d. He challenged Shorten to repeat the claim. Morrison also noted unions had donated $20m to the Labor party, which he said amounted to Shorten \u201cputting his hand into the pocket of every union member in the country\u201d to fund Labor\u2019s campaign. Speaking on Radio National after Morrison, Chalmers said it would come as \u201cno surprise\u201d to voters that unions, the industrial wing of the labour movement, donated to the Labor party, the political wing. \u201cThe point we\u2019re making is that the prime ministership ... should be determined by the person who has the better policies for this country, not the person who has the most zeroes on their bank balance,\u201d he said. Chalmers accepted that politicians are allowed to make personal political donations, and that state and federal Labor MPs pay a levy of 4-6% of their salaries to their Labor branches. But he said Turnbull\u2019s was the biggest personal political donation in history. Chalmers said the Australian people would ultimately judge whether it was good for democracy \u201cthat one of the leaders can find $1.75m down the back of the couch to spray around in the dying days of the election\u201d. He said Turnbull must himself think the donation was \u201cpretty dodgy or it wouldn\u2019t have taken seven months for the figure to be dragged out of him\u201d. On Wednesday Turnbull addressed donation reform in his first major speech for 2017 at the National Press Club, supporting release of public information \u201cmore promptly or in as close to real time as possible\u201d. He said he would have no objection to more timely donation reforms and said it was a matter for the joint standing committee on electoral matters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
