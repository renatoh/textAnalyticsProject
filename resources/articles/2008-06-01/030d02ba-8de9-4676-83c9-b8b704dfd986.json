He sounded, she said, like a headmaster. Martin Stephen, 58, successively head of the Perse school in Cambridge, Manchester grammar and now St Paul's in London, was responding to my request for an interview (\"I hear you want to do a hatchet job on me\"). He has been a head for more than 20 years and, measured by mentions in the national press, he is the school leader with the second highest profile in the country after Wellington college's Anthony Seldon, the biographer of Tony Blair. He is also apparently the model Jilly Cooper used in her latest novel for a private school head, described as \"a great teacher because he was a great communicator\". Stephen is a roll-up-the-sleeves, get-out-and-about kind of head. One parent from his time at Manchester grammar recalls that he was always on the sports field on Saturday mornings, chatting to players and spectators. He patrols the school grounds with his pet labrador, to which, with the self-conscious eccentricity that headteachers often affect, he attaches a school tie. He is an unashamed elitist - \"one of the saddest things about the past 30 years is how the word 'elite' has changed from a term of admiration to one of derision\" - and talking to him is a bit like being in a pub with a man who thinks the country is going to the dogs. You hope he'll stop, or at least give you a chance to request elucidation, but he keeps saying \"and another thing\". He believes in streaming not only children but also teachers (of which more later), doesn't think anything like 50% of the population should go to university, and hates the idea of Oxford and Cambridge admitting comprehensive students with lower grades. He gets very angry about such things and bursts out with, for example: \"What the hell's wrong with being middle class? When are we going to admit the middle class have got it right?\" And: \"It's absolute piffle to say we're looking for potential in 18-year-olds when they've been at school for 13 years.\" And: \"Every child in the UK should have an education like the one we give here.\" I point out that, if every school had grounds as extensive as St Paul's, there wouldn't be much space left for houses or growing food. Stephen also gets angry about school league tables which, on several occasions, he has denounced as \"a cancer on the face of education\". He says anger is an important part of his character. \"It is a much underrated emotion. It can produce all sorts of horrible things, but also wonderful things.\" Nasty raven He once suffered from an appalling stammer, and was rejected when he first applied to do a DipEd course because, they said at Leeds University, he'd be a laughing stock in the classroom and could never enter any career that involved public speaking. So he got rid of the stammer, he says, \"by getting angry\". He adds: \"It never leaves you. It's like a rather nasty raven perched on your shoulder. Every time I stand up to speak, I have a fear.\" About a year after he started at St Paul's in 2004, he suffered a stroke - and got angry again. \"I found myself in a hospital bed, hardly any feeling in my left side, no control over my hands, couldn't talk properly. Got no help from the hospital at all. All they wanted me to do was lie there. For about an hour, I was in complete despair. Then I got angry.\" He still sounds annoyed. The NHS, he says, would have left him to rot, and he had to steal a Zimmer frame to start moving at all. When he got home, he designed his own rehabilitation programme, drawing on the experiences of his father-in-law, who'd also had a stroke. Each day included bouncing and catching a tennis ball 2,000 times, two hours of Victorian copybook handwriting, two hours of reciting poems with a cork between his teeth, and two hours of walking up and down the stripes on the lawn. He also - \"this was the only fun bit\" - played computer games, crashing an onscreen jet 4,796 times before he finally landed it. He's quite riveting about all this - much more so than he is about education - and has written a book, out this month, called Diary of a Stroke. I have no idea to what extent his rehab programme is generally applicable but I suspect the book will be an inspiration to many. A chunky extract has already appeared in the Daily Mail. Stephen is no novice as an author. He's written 15 books on English literature and naval history, plus four rather curious historical thrillers. Their hero is Henry Gresham, a sort of 16th- and 17th-century James Bond, who does improbable things with swords and doublets. Most other characters are real historical figures such as James I, Drake and Shakespeare. Stephen gave me The Conscience of the King to read. I expected to dislike it because it has a convoluted plot based on silly theories about Shakespeare not writing his own plays, and I don't much care for thrillers anyway. But it's well paced, the 17th-century background is convincingly done and, in the end, I enjoyed it. Codpiece fingering It isn't exactly a \"bodice-ripper\", as some press accounts promised, though I can report (for St Paul's boys who don't want to linger over the high master's prose) a man fingering his codpiece on page 55, a breast falling out of a gown on page 215 and an aborted rape, quite graphically described, on page 252. Stephen says writing books was all he ever wanted to do, and he went into teaching by accident. After reading English at Leeds, he intended to get an Oxford or Cambridge PhD and become a don, writing learned tomes about literature. But he fell \"absolutely, totally, stupidly, hopelessly, head-over-heels in love\" with a woman in the year below - she is now his wife and also head of a fee-charging school - and didn't dare leave during her final year lest somebody else snap her up. Rejected by Leeds, he took his DipEd at nearby Sheffield. He still didn't intend to go into teaching, but was advised he should combine it with a part-time PhD, because a university would value proof that he could teach and research at the same time. He did once have a university job lined up, but it fell victim to spending cuts. So, in the end, he wrote his books while teaching and later headmastering. He started the Gresham books, he says, \"because my wife was fed up with losing me every holiday to books that sold only about three copies\". Apart from a brief spell in remand homes before university - where two boys threatened his life, one with a garden fork, the other with a kitchen knife - and later a visiting lectureship, his entire working life has been in public schools, starting with his old school, Uppingham. That was surprising because he had been \"absolutely miserable\" as a boarding pupil there, took up smoking, led a hunger strike against repeated servings of prunes, and nearly got expelled for chatting to village girls. \"The whole system,\" he says, \"was alien to my basic instincts.\" His father was a Sheffield GP and chairman of Sheffield Wednesday football club - he later became chairman of the Football Association and sacked Alf Ramsay, England's World Cup-winning manager - and the family lived in a large stone house, around which the council built a housing estate. \"I spent holidays on this estate, and I had a friend who was very, very intelligent but had failed the 11-plus and was clearly going to leave school at 15 for some minor clerical job. I remember going back to school and seeing a charming and delightful member of my year group who was just not very clever. It was clear he would go off and read medicine. I've spent most of my life praying that, if I wake up in casualty, I won't see this guy looking down on me. I thought at the time: this is wrong, wrong.\" Places on merit Stephen's passionate belief is that independent school places should be allocated strictly on merit. At Manchester grammar, he raised \u00a310m so that 300 out of 1,400 boys were financed by bursaries that paid all or part of their fees. At St Paul's, even more ambitiously, he wants to raise a big enough endowment fund to make admissions completely \"needs-blind\" by 2030, so that nobody gets in just because their parents can pay. Isn't he proposing a more efficient way of creaming off talent from comprehensives? Isn't he aware of research showing the best way to raise standards across the board is to give every school a cross-section of abilities and social backgrounds? \"No, I don't believe it. It irritates me beyond belief when people say middle-class parents will march on bad standards in the maintained sector and change everything. What they'll do is colonise two or three schools. Flinging the nice middle-class child into a comprehensive whose values the parents don't agree with simply wouldn't work.\" Stephen argues bright children should be taught together so \"they egg each other on\". But he doesn't want selection at 11. \"You're hitting children at a massively vulnerable age, when they're very fragile and malleable and plastic. The natural age for transfer to secondary school is 14.\" Even then, he doesn't want conventional selection because, he says, \"you can't ignore the leftwing argument\". He wouldn't stop any children choosing the grammar school at 14. If they wanted to progress, however, they would have to meet the requirements at the end of the first year. If they failed to do so and didn't then leave, they would just stay where they were, with the 14-year-olds. \"Never, ever throw a child out.\" Stephen has several slightly wacky ideas like that. He believes, as I mentioned earlier, in streaming teachers, so that the brightest children are taught by the top graduates in their subjects. \"It's not a question of the best teachers,\" he insists. \"It's the most suitable.\" Teaching the most able, he argues, should be a specialist career path, like teaching children at the other end of the spectrum. \"Many, many graduates know they can teach their own kind, but can't teach children who will leave at 16. My life at school was ruined by brilliant mathematicians who couldn't understand I was as thick as the main deck of HMS Victory when it came to maths. I was in the bottom set, and my life was saved by a man who came in and ordered us not even to try to understand what he told us. We all fell at his feet, and got the equivalent of a GCSE maths C grade.\" A few years ago, a Financial Times profile described Stephen as \"ever so slightly smug\". Inevitably, it made him very angry, but I can't quite clear him of the charge. He explains how St Paul's runs Saturday masterclasses in maths for 30 children from local state schools and, though I'm sure they're a good thing, he can't help sounding a bit patronising. \"We at St Paul's specialise in bright children. We know what switches them on and, more importantly, what switches them off.\" Even when he talks about his stroke, there's a hint of self-satisfaction: \"I am one of only 10% to make a full recovery.\" But, like all journalists, I appreciate a man who uses vivid language and doesn't care too much what he says. The FT also called him pompous, but he isn't that. It's just that he's run three of the country's top fee-charging schools, believes absolutely in what they and he do, and offers an articulate, media-savvy defence. Whereas I, believing the very existence of such schools damages the prospects of more than 90% of our children, would place dynamite under them at once."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
