So the Home Office's insistence that the Act should not apply to almost 3,000 children in prison or on remand was always morally wrong. Friday's landmark court judgment confirms that the Home Secretary's position was also 'wrong in law'. The decision meets one of the central demands of The Observer's Children Behind Bars campaign. The Howard League, the Children's Society and the coalition of children's charities which brought the case deserve Mr Justice Munby's commendation for 'bringing to public attention matters which ought to shock the conscience of every citizen'. The 75-page judgment sets out in stark detail how placing children with chaotic and troubled backgrounds in a prison service designed for adult offenders exacerbates the worst of their lives to date. The high levels of bullying, of mental health problems, of self-harm and attempted suicide are, tragically, all too predictable. Prisons Minister Hilary Benn says he welcomes this judgment and that the Home Office will respect it. But he should also act urgently to end the scandal of children under 16 being placed in prison on remand. Admitting that child prisoners have statutory and human rights may finally lead to the recognition that prison is no place for children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
