I had been slim all my life, but one day I looked at some photos of myself and said, 'Nah. I'm not happy. I'm going to sort this out and get back to how I was.' So now I work out three times a week and I love it. Even the perfect workout can start off really badly. I wake up in the morning and it's grey, as it usually is, and I just can't be bothered. All I want to do is roll over in the bed, but James Lloyd, my trainer, bounces on to my doorstep and announces that we're going for a run. I always say, 'You're having a laugh, it's freezing,' but he always drags me out and tells me how wicked it's going to be. We do a five-mile run around Regent's Park and Primrose Hill, and he gossips away to entertain me. He can run and talk at the same time because he's just an Adonis. When you look at him, you just know he has to be a model or a trainer and it gives you great hope that you can achieve the same for yourself. By the time we get halfway through the run, I'm just jogging away and loving it. I want to take on the men when I lift weights, so I do serious weights when I get back to the gym. I really like working my abs - it's the hardest thing to do, but the most rewarding when it all comes together. I work every single body part, but you have to be careful of the ying and yang when you workout because if you create any imbalances it can be really dangerous. For instance, you can't do your biceps without doing your triceps. I finish off with yoga stretches and I feel a million dollars. When I finish and I know I've done all I could, it's just bliss. It feels like the cuddly stage after sex and I'm ready to face the day. \u00b7 Beverley Knight plays tonight at the Brixton Academy supporting Jamiroquai"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
