Andrew Hall became Michael Hall, and Nadeem Malik was simply beyond him. This was hardly the cutting-edge image that the miniature game is seeking to project. Worcestershire had already qualified for the knockout stage by winning three out of three before yesterday, and could be forgiven for relaxing the foot on the throttle. But Somerset had only pride to play for, as they await the arrival of Ricky Ponting, and at least seemed to summon up some spirit from a disturbed dressing room. The diminutive 19-year-old James Hildreth has emerged this summer as a batsman of rare quality, but too often he has had to try to mask the failings of more experienced players. Yesterday he had scampering support from Keith Dutch (47) and John Francis (31) as he moved to a 30-ball half-century. One six at the expense of the England spinner Gareth Batty went into the River Tone, placing Hildreth in the proud Somerset line of Arthur Wellard, Harold Gimblett and Ian Botham, all of whom liked to see the ball come back wet. Hildreth perished on 51, slashing a Kabir Ali full toss to point, but Somerset had something at which to bowl. Worcestershire were immediately undermined by the mix-'em-up medium pace of Aaron Laraman, whose ration of four overs brought him the top four wickets at a cost of 15. Graeme Hick snicked behind, Hall lofted to deep mid-off, Vikram Solanki lost his off stump to the slower one, and Ben Smith slashed to short extra-cover. David Leatherdale put one ball into the car park and another on to the roof of the old pavilion. But it was all too late, and deafening music engulfed a jubilant crowd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
