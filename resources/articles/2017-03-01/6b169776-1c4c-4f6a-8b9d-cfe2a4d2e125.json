Here\u2019s what happened. FBI director James Comey announced for the first time that \u201cthe FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts\u201d. Trump campaign figures mentioned at the hearing included Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, JD Gordon, Jeff Sessions and Kellyanne Conway. Comey declined to say whether the president was or is being personally investigated. Comey knocked down Trump\u2019s assertion on Twitter that Barack Obama had \u201cwire tapped\u201d him. \u201cWe do not have any information that supports those tweets,\u201d Comey said. Republican chairman Devin Nunes admitted: \u201cWe know there was not a physical wiretap at Trump Tower. However it is possible that other surveillance technology was used against President Trump and his associates.\u201d Tweets sent from the @potus account during the hearing mischaracterized Comey\u2019s testimony and that of NSA director Michael Rogers. One tweet said the witnesses had told Congress that Russia \u201cdid not influence electoral process\u201d. Comey was asked about the tweet. \u201cWe\u2019ve offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact, because it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve looked at,\u201d Comey said. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t our intention to say that today.\u201d Rogers denied a White House claim that the Obama administration asked GCHQ to conduct surveillance on Trump, saying it would have been a violation of US law to ask the British to conduct such an operation. Republicans called for punishment for anyone who leaked classified information to the press, concerning Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian operatives or other issues. One member promised to grill former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper about leaks next week. It emerged that the FBI investigation of Russian tampering was launched in late July, although the public did not learn of the investigation for months, well after the FBI saw fit to announce its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
