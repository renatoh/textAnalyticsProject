The news will come as a blow to McLeish, who has seen Birmingham slip to 16th, within two points of the bottom three, after winning only two of their past 15 Premier League games. The City manager was informed there would be no funds available at a meeting when the club also discussed the improved offer they have since made to Sebastian Larsson in a bid to prevent the former Arsenal player from leaving on a free transfer in the summer. McLeish, who has on trial the USA striker Edson Buddle, who scored 19 goals in 28 matches while playing alongside David Beckham for LA Galaxy last season, said: \"It looks as though we'll be looking to bring players in on loan. We are not in a position to spend at this moment. We are looking at the loan situation and if push comes to shove then we will see.\" Larsson's future remains unresolved and has not been helped by Peter Coates, the Stoke City chairman, revealing his club's interest in signing the player in a television interview this week. Birmingham will not be making an official complaint to the Premier League but they have contacted Stoke to make it clear that Coates's comments were unacceptable and to remind them of the rules regarding discussing players under contract at other clubs. \"Maybe Peter doesn't know the rules,\" McLeish said. \"I'm sure he will have been aware of them by today. Julia Shelton, the secretary, would be on to that. She has been in the game a long time. We'll forgive him on this occasion.\" Larsson has rejected Birmingham's initial offer of a new contract but the club have since gone back with an improved deal. \"We have made Seb and his representative [another] offer,\" McLeish said. \"We'd like to keep Seb. We don't like young guys like Seb walking away on free transfers. He's a good asset and he's had a good season so far. We will have to see whether he accepts [the offer] or not or if there is any further negotiation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
