Later, with his writing partner Phil Coulter, he also came up with hits for Cilla Black and the Bay City Rollers. When Shaw was chosen to represent the UK in Vienna in 1967, Martin and Coulter were determined to write the winning song. Martin reasoned that it should open on a long note, along the lines of Domenico Modugno\u2019s Volare. \u201cThat\u2019s stealing,\u201d said Coulter. \u201cNo,\u201d said Martin, \u201cHe stole it from \u2018Oooo-kla-homa\u2019 so we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Puppet on a String gave the UK its first Eurovision victory and was a No 1 single for Shaw. She disliked the song, which was the last of her three chart-topping singles, and felt that it destroyed her credibility. But it went on to sell more than 4m copies. The following year Martin and Coulter felt confident of repeating their success with a new composition, Congratulations. Having arrived one morning before Coulter at their shared office in London, Martin saw that his writing partner had been working on a song in which the five key notes had been given the title I Think I Love You. He disliked the title on the basis that \u201cyou either love someone or you don\u2019t\u201d, and wondered instead whether it could be replaced by a single, five-syllable word. By the time Coulter had arrived, Martin was able to say: \u201cWe\u2019ve just written a hit song. Congratulations!\u201d Although their composition lost out to Spain by one vote, Martin told me later: \u201cWhile it was embarrassing to come second to such a poor song as La La La, really we won, because nobody plays La La La today and Congratulations is everywhere.\u201d The Spanish entry disappeared without trace, but the runner-up got to No 1 in the UK singles chart, was a hit throughout the rest of Europe and remains ubiquitous. In 1969 Martin wrote about the collapse of his marriage in Surround Yourself With Sorrow, which was a hit at No 3 in the UK for Black. In 1970 he and Coulter wrote the official song for England\u2019s World Cup squad, Back Home, once the silver-tongued Martin had persuaded the England manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, that it was a good idea. They then followed up with My Boy, a translation into English of a French song that had originally been released by Claude Fran\u00e7ois. It was recorded by Richard Harris (1971) and then Elvis Presley (1974). They wrote for the Dubliners, their most poignant song being Scorn Not His Simplicity, about a child with Down\u2019s syndrome. In the early to mid-70s, Martin and Coulter began to establish the look and sound of the Bay City Rollers, and wrote several hit songs for them, including Summerlove Sensation, Shang-a-Lang and All of Me Loves All of You (all 1974). In a similar vein they recorded The Bump (1974) with Kenny and had another UK No 1 with Forever and Ever for Slik (featuring Midge Ure) in 1976. Martin was born William Macpherson, the son of Letty (nee Wylie) and Ian Macpherson, in Govan, the dockside district of Glasgow, where his father worked in the shipyard. \u201cThere was shipbuilding around me all day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe reason I have such a loud voice is because we all had to shout to make ourselves heard.\u201d His parents liked to socialise, and his father would entertain on accordion or piano, but at Govan high school their son was more interested in history and geography than music. After leaving school at 15, he worked in the shipyard himself, and then trained as a marine engineer. It was on a night shift doing that job, while listening to Bobby Darin\u2019s Dream Lover playing on the radio, that he first seriously considered the idea of composing music. \u201cThe lyrics were tight and modern,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was my kind of rock music and I felt then that I could make it as a songwriter.\u201d Martin did not take an immediate change in direction, however. Having married Margaret (Mag) Howe in 1960, he accepted a post as an engineer in South Africa, where, shortly after his arrival, he witnessed the Sharpeville massacre, watching from the safety of a tree as police fired on a crowd of anti-apartheid protestors, killing 69 people. When he and Mag returned to the UK in 1962, Martin tried to interest Denmark Street publishers in songs that he had written while he was away. The music publisher Cyril Gee told him to change his name, suggesting that that any combination of 10 letters was lucky for songwriters \u2013 and so in early 1963 he became known as Bill Martin. That year a Liverpool singer, Tommy Quickly, recorded his song Kiss Me Now, and he wrote English lyrics for the winning Eurovision song of 1965, Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son, which became A Lonely Singing Doll (1965), sung by Twinkle. He also wrote for the Dublin pop group the Bachelors, and through that work befriended Coulter, their young arranger. Martin suggested the two of them write together, and their first success was Hi Hi Hazel for Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band in 1966. Eventually, in 1983, he broke up his partnership with Coulter. The same year he also fell out with the entrepreneur Eddie Healey over the financing of a West End musical, Jukebox. His ambition to write his own hit musical was never realised; he came close with a proposed stage version of the 1979 film The Water Babies, which he had scored with Coulter, but the logistics of having a large water tank on stage were too great. He was appointed MBE in 2014 and his autobiography, Congratulations \u2013 Songwriter to the Stars, was published in 2017. He and Mag divorced in 1970, after which he bought John Lennon\u2019s former home, Kenwood, in Weybridge, Surrey, and moved in with Jan Olley, whom he married in 1972. He is survived by Jan, and their children, Angus and Melanie, and by Meran and Alison, his children from his first marriage. \u2022 Bill Martin (William Wylie Macpherson), songwriter, born 9 November 1938; died 26 March 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
