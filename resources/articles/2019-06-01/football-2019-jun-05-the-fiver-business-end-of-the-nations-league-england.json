Fiver readers of a certain age and nationality will remember Turnabout, a daytime BBC TV quiz show that was as ludicrously complicated as it was utterly compelling. Despite nobody involved, least of all its host \u2013 erstwhile Football Weekly stand-in Rob Curling \u2013 appearing to have any idea what on earth was going on in its Sphere, Palindrome, Star or About Turn games, the show ran for 239 episodes across eight series and all involved seemed to have a very nice time. More recently, in their own attempt to put an end to the kind of meaningless friendlies that have long been the scourge of international football, Uefa introduced its own similarly complicated competition and called it the Nations League. Since its inception last year, England have played four games and advanced to this week\u2019s finals and now stand on the brink of winning their first trophy since 1966 without, one suspects, many of their fans and possibly even players having even the foggiest idea why or how. Not that any of that matters as we approach the business end of the competition, as things couldn\u2019t really be simpler. It\u2019s semi-final time with Switzerland taking on Portugal in Porto on Wednesday, before England face the Netherlands in Guimaraes on Thursday, before Sunday\u2019s final and third-place play-off. Flying off to Portugal, having welcomed the England internationals who contested last weekend\u2019s Big Cup final back into the group, Gareth Southgate will address the press there later on, which means that by the time people read this he\u2019ll have already answered questions such as \u201cAny knocks?\u201d, \u201cWill Harry Kane start?\u201d and \u201cWere he, Dele and Eric upset when Jordan, Trent and Joe wore their winner\u2019s medals down to breakfast?\u201d Worryingly, in their absence, Marcus Rashford has been holding the fort and said there is unlikely to be any sour grapes between the two sets of players. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you play for Tottenham or Liverpool or whoever,\u201d said the striker who clearly wasn\u2019t involved in Madrid. \u201cWhile we\u2019re here that doesn\u2019t matter at all. We\u2019ll battle for each other. That\u2019s what\u2019s special about this group, because that transition to international football seems to be very smooth. [Gareth Southgate] always says to us: \u2018When you\u2019re in camp we want you to enjoy yourself.\u2019 He wants it as close as it can be to how it is at a club.\u201d Unless that club happens to be the one Rashford plays for, one hopes, where at least half the first-team squad are surplus to requirements. \u201cBasically it\u2019s like your club, where you\u2019d fight for the person next to you,\u201d Rashford added, without laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same thing here.\u201d With that in mind, England fans are advised that Sunday\u2019s third-place play-off kicks off in Guimaraes at 2pm BST.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201c[He] was our biggest international football leader of all time, no Swede has had a similar influence on football in the world. He was deeply respected as Uefa president and vice-president of Fifa, his leadership has aroused admiration worldwide\u201d \u2013 the Swedish FA\u2019s Karl-Erik Nilsson pays tribute to Lennart Johansson, who has died aged 89. FIVER LETTERS \u201cNot to worry. USA! USA!! USA!!! reader Chris Fuller\u2019s \u2018argument\u2019 regarding your perceived tea-timely politic bias (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) lost all credibility before he\u2019d even started. Anyone who opens by describing The Fiver as \u2018often humorous\u2019 is clearly talking nonsense\u201d \u2013 Steve Bennett (and 1,056 others). \u201cAs a California-born, USA! USA!! USA!!! citizen who has long been a fan of The Fiver and its typically clever letter writers, I have to express scorn and take umbrage at Chris\u2019s clumsy and buffoonish attempt to defend his vote for our disgrace of a president. Yes Chris, it\u2019s your right to vote. It\u2019s also your obligation to take criticism for enabling a corrupt and predatory charlatan to ascend to the most powerful position in the world. And frankly, Fiver, I\u2019d respectfully request you not publish idiotic letters from my compatriots. I read The Fiver for a daily dose of the beautiful game and the culture of its supporters across the pond. I get enough of dumb Americans every day\u201d \u2013 Todd Condor (and others). \u201cThanks to Chris for providing a rare bit of humour in The Fiver\u201d \u2013 Kim Lightbody.

Juventus have asked Manchester United if they would rather have loads more cash for the Glazers to take out of the club instead of Paul Pogba in their midfield. Meanwhile, Diego Maradona has offered to be the strong and stable leader Old Trafford needs. \u201cIf Manchester [United] need a coach, I\u2019m the man to do it,\u201d he tooted. \u201cI know they sell lots of shirts around the world, but they need to win trophies, too. I can do that for them.\u201d Maurizio Sarri has amazing hearing and can hear Italy calling him home. \u201cI feel that something is missing,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cIt has been a heavy year. I begin to feel the weight of distant friends and elderly parents I rarely see.\u201d Ryan Lowe has jumped ship from financially-knacked Bury to drop a division and become Plymouth Argyle manager. After test-driving Bayern Munich for two years, 2014\u2019s James/Hames/Hamez Rodr\u00edguez has said \u201cNo, gracias\u201d to a permanent deal and ambled back to Real Madrid. And isn\u2019t Fifa brilliant? \u201c[It] has gone from being toxic, almost criminal, to what it should be, an organisation that develops and cares about football,\u201d backslapped president Gianni Infantino after trumpeting news that its cash reserves had tripled to more than \u00a32bn. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending it on dodgy deals, we\u2019re investing it.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?
