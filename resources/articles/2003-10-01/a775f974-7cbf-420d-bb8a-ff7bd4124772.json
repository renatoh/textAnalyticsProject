Will Greenwood is back with the squad after a week's compassionate leave and, if England can show the same fortitude as their 31-year-old centre, their World Cup campaign is far from over. One would never have guessed from Greenwood's remarkably candid press conference yesterday that he and his family have been to hell and back over the past nine days. First-class return flights on British Airways cushioned the journey slightly but the Harlequins player is adamant his wife's recent pregnancy complications will not undermine his contribution to England's cause in Australia. If that proves to be so, it will be a massive triumph of professionalism over all the odds. Caroline Greenwood is still in the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital but is no longer in intensive care and has urged her husband to rejoin the squad he left after the victory over South Africa in Perth last Saturday week. \"We're in a different ball-park to where we were last Monday and it's just fingers crossed now,\" said Greenwood. \"The doctors are doing an amazing job, Caro's a tough cookie and we're hopeful that in three to four weeks' time, or whenever the English team return, she'll be in a good state and the doctors might allow her to come home. She has had an operation, the results have been good and she's now stable.\" When Greenwood flew back to the UK, though, there was no way of knowing what might await him. The couple lost their first child Freddie, who was born prematurely, last September and his wife, as previously, was 21 weeks pregnant. \"There were all sorts of things going through your mind. I had no idea going back what I would be faced with. You almost don't want to discuss ifs. At this moment we're delighted with the progress Caro has made and I'm delighted to be back on the Gold Coast. \"Life does go on; we learnt that with Freddie last year. It's important I continue to do what I do and hopefully provide for a future family. This World Cup is part of my life and this squad have been through a lot already. \"When we lost Freddie last September I found the squad a fantastic place to be during the autumn internationals. I've been good mates with a lot of these guys for a long time. You even get to the stage where you're comfortable with silence. \"I wouldn't have come back if I hadn't felt this was the place where I could get a smile back and look forward to playing my rugby. You find it almost comforting to go and put your kit on and have a game. It's a chance to escape and that's what I enjoy about it. As far as I'm concerned I'm available to play against Uruguay on Sunday.\" Woodward will ponder that decision overnight before announcing his team tomorrow but, until then, the entire squad have been given a couple of days off to reflect on their progress so far. Not all of them will want to pore over every bruising detail of the 35-22 win over Samoa, particularly as the video is likely to reveal more unsettling evidence that sides are working England out. If you hassle England's half-backs, knock their big men back in the tackle and stop their back-row at source, they start to look as mortal as anyone. The coaching staff are also concerned about the rising penalty count but Greenwood has proved a breezy antidote to any unease - \"I'm not trying to be an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger but I haven't seen the video\" - and believes he has returned to a squad whose mood remains buoyant. \"You can tell immediately they weren't elated with the performance but, as far as I'm aware, the boys are in good spirits, excited about going through to the further stage of the tournament. There's been cricket on the TV, Sachin Tendulkar's scored a century against Australia and there's not been too much chat about rugby.\" Nor will casual insults from outside the camp about England's backs resembling a plodding diesel vehicle bother Greenwood and co. \"We know we're not the flashiest side in world rugby but we enjoy competitive games and we like grinding out victories if they need grinding out. Professional sport is about winning games. If people want to call us a tractor, then they can call us a tractor.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
