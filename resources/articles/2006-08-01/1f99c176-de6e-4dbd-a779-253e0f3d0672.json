Lyon, who will return to the National Rugby League in Australia next season, scored two of the 12 tries and added 12 goals for a 32-point haul as Saints displayed some wonderful attacking football to maintain their six-point lead over Hull at the top. Paul Wellens and Sean Long also scored two tries apiece as Saints, 36-0 ahead at the break, ruthlessly turned the screw with anothet 36 points. The Saints coach Daniel Anderson has made clear he intends to field a young and inexperienced side away to the Catalans Dragons next weekend, so this game was a last chance to give his Challenge Cup final squad a run-out. Huddersfield, Saints' opponents in the final, will not relish running the rule over the video of this game. Long and Jason Hooper successfully returned after leg injuries and Paul Sculthorpe came through another game on his comeback trail. Only James Graham and Lee Gilmour of Saints' likely 17-man squad for the final were absent. \"I spoke to the players about Graham and Gilmour missing out,\" said Anderson. \"They're not happy as they are fit but that's indicative of the strength we have. Lyon was fantastic today. He is extremely skilful and I thought the young boy opposite him [Castleford's promising centre Michael Shenton] did little wrong.\" Castleford's points tally of 17 is four more than any previously relegated side but such is the competitive nature of Super League this season they look in increasing danger, especially with only one of the remaining four games at home. They badly missed Peter Lupton, who was one of five first-choice players ruled out by injury, and his suspended half-back partner Danny Brough. Gray Viane grabbed their only try in the last minute, the first points the Tigers had scored for 222 minutes. \"We are needled up to the eyeballs,\" said Terry Matterson, the Tigers coach. \"The rigours of the season have taken their toll and we have got to find a way to regroup. But what a side Saints are. They are running hot. It was no bigger blow to confidence and morale than losing last week to Wakefield. We only have a short turn-around before we go to Bradford on Friday and, apart from Brough, I'm not sure we'll be getting anyone else back.\" Castleford Tigers Platt; A Fletcher, Viane, Shenton, Bird; McGoldrick, Handforth; D Sculthorpe, Henderson, Nutley, Manu, R Fletcher, Payne.
