CoverGirl announced its newest spokesperson is actually a cover boy. The brand announced that James Charles, a 17-year-old makeup artist from New York, is its newest model. The news was fittingly announced via Instagram, where Charles regularly posts his makeup looks and has nearly half a million followers after creating an account last year. Singer Katy Perry, another of the company\u2019s brand ambassadors and current CoverGirl, was the first to break the news. \u201cJust wrapped another great @COVERGIRL shoot. Honored to have the pleasure to announce the very first COVERBOY, James Charles!\u201d she wrote on Instagram. CoverGirl\u2019s Instagram posted a video of Charles speaking about his new role. \u201cToday I\u2019m living out one of my biggest dreams and I\u2019m currently on set of my first ever TV commercial with CoverGirl,\u201d he said with a huge smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I am a new CoverGirl.\u201d Charles will be appearing in advertisements for CoverGirl\u2019s newest mascara called So Lashy, according to the Huffington Post. In a statement, the makeup brand said that all of their CoverGirl models are \u201crole models and boundary-breakers, fearlessly expressing themselves, standing up for what they believe, and redefining what it means to be beautiful\u201d. \u201cJames Charles is no exception. One year ago, he boldly chose to launch his Instagram to the world, using transformative, dynamic makeup looks to showcase the many facets of his personality, serving as an inspiration to anyone who might have been afraid to do the same,\u201d the statement said, according to the Huffington Post. Singer and actor Zendaya became one of the brand\u2019s spokesmodels earlier this year, joining the ranks of women such as Queen Latifah, Ellen DeGeneres, Rihanna and Taylor Swift. Many on Twitter praised CoverGirl for choosing Charles to be the face of their brand and congratulated the young makeup artist using #CoverGirlJames. Charles retweeted a few supportive messages himself. \u201cFind a more iconic moment \u2026 I\u2019ll wait,\u201d musician and makeup artist Talia Mar wrote alongside Charles\u2019s photo. There were some negative responses to CoverGirl\u2019s Instagram post, with a few people threatening to boycott the brand. A photo of him retaking his senior portraits in his makeup racked up tens of thousands of likes and retweets last month. In an interview earlier this year, Charles told Marie Claire that makeup is an art form for him. He said it \u201ctook a lot of thorough conversations\u201d with his parents to make them understand that it wasn\u2019t an expression of his gender identity. \u201cI\u2019m still confident as a boy and I will always be a boy. I can be confident with bare skin and with a full face,\u201d he told the magazine. Charles expressed his excitement for his new gig on his Instagram and Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s only 12 and today has already been so crazy. I am so thankful/excited for everything in store and the support has been amazing,\u201d he tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
