The Tottenham Hotspur manager, who was arrested on suspicion of false accounting and conspiracy to defraud in November 2007, learned on Friday that HM Revenue and Customs would institute criminal proceedings against him in the new year. His solicitors, BCL Burton Copeland, released a statement last night confirming that was the case and Redknapp has now sought to play down the significance of the latest development. Redknapp is set to be charged with cheating the public revenue in relation to allegations of unpaid tax on an offshore payment he received from the former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric when the duo were working together at Fratton Park. Mandaric, who is now the chairman at Leicester City, will also be charged and both have strongly denied any wrongdoing. \"It's not a major issue,\" said Redknapp, who was speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme today. \"It's something that was done between myself and my ex-chairman, away from football, and it really is ... well, it's unbelievable, I've got to be truthful. I can't comment on it, but it's farcical.\" Tottenham have given Redknapp their \"full support\" and said that his position at the club is \"unaffected\". The 62-year-old's solicitor, Ian Burton, who represented Kieren Fallon, the jockey whose race\u2011fixing trial collapsed in 2007 because of insufficient evidence, said: \"We believe that the decision to commence proceedings will, in due course, be shown to have been totally misconceived.\" The news that Redknapp and Mandaric will face charges comes a little less than a month after Peter Storrie, the Portsmouth chief executive, appeared before City of Westminster magistrates court in central London charged with having cheated the public revenue over a signing-on fee paid to Amdy Faye, the Senegal midfielder who joined the club from Auxerre in 2003. Storrie later claimed that the \"proceedings are a waste of public money\" and vowed to clear his name. Redknapp and Mandaric were informed in October that they had both been exonerated in relation to Faye's transfer and have always maintained their innocence over the existing allegations. \"It was entirely a private matter between Harry and myself,\" Mandaric told the Guardian in October. \"I just helped him on the side to make some money away from football,\" said the 71-year-old. \"I paid for it myself off the stock market in America. It had nothing to do with the football club \u2013 it was a deal between Harry, who is a friend of mine, and myself \u2013 and it was a very small amount. I was just helping him to make investment outside.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
