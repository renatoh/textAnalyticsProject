The headset, called Oculus Go, won\u2019t require plugging in a smartphone or a cord tethering it to a personal computer like Oculus Rift or its competitor HTC\u2019s Vive do. \u201cI am more committed than ever to the future of virtual reality,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to a crowd of computer programmers gathered in San Jose, California, for Oculus\u2019s annual conference. \u201cThis all-in-one device makes VR more accessible than ever and represents a huge leap forward in comfort, visual clarity, and ease-of-use,\u201d added Oculus in a blogpost. The headset is lightweight and features a high-resolution LCD screen and speakers built in to deliver \u201cspatial audio\u201d. When it hits the market next year it will cost $199, which is a big drop from the Rift, which originally sold for $599 and required a powerful computer costing at least $500 to power the virtual reality experiences and games. Recent discounts lowered the Rift\u2019s price to $399 at various times during the summer, a markdown Oculus now says will be permanent. \u201cThe strategy for Facebook is to make the onboarding to VR as easy and inexpensive as possible,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research company. \u201cAnd $199 is an inexpensive entry for a lot of people who are just starting out in VR. The problem is you will be spending that money on a device that only does VR and nothing else.\u201d The Oculus Go will straddle the market between the Rift and the Samsung Gear, a $129 headset that runs on some of Samsung\u2019s higher-priced phones. It will be able to run the same VR as the Samsung Gear, leading Blau to conclude the Go will rely on the same Android operating system as the Gear and probably include similar processors as Samsung phones. The Gear competes against other headsets, such as Google\u2019s $99 Daydream View, that require a smartphone. Google is also working on a stand-alone headset that won\u2019t require a phone, but the company hasn\u2019t specified when that device will be released or how much it will cost. Zuckerberg promised the Oculus Go would be \u201cthe most accessible VR experience ever\u201d and help realize his new goal of having 1 billion people dwelling in virtual reality at some point in the future. Two days earlier, a cartoon version of Zuckerberg visited hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico, in a livestream that was part disaster tourism, part product promotion. He and Facebook\u2019s head of social virtual reality, Rachel Franklin, appeared as avatars within the broadcast from his profile as they \u201cteleported\u201d to different locations using Facebook\u2019s \u201csocial VR\u201d tool Spaces. In reality they were at the company\u2019s Menlo Park, California, headquarters wearing virtual reality headsets. After many people criticized the VR broadcast in the comments on his Facebook profile, Zuckerberg apologized. \u201cOne of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what\u2019s happening in different parts of the world,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to publicize a partnership with the Red Cross where Facebook helps create population maps that can be used by rescue workers. \u201cReading some of the comments, I realize this wasn\u2019t clear, and I\u2019m sorry to anyone this offended.\u201d Facebook and other major technology companies such as Google and Microsoft that are betting on VR have a long way to go. About 16m head-mounted display devices were shipped in 2016, a number expected to rise to 22m this year, according to Gartner. Those figures include headsets for what is known as augmented reality. Zuckerberg, though, remains convinced that VR will evolve into a technology that reshapes the way people interact and experience life, much as Facebook\u2019s social networks and smartphones already have. His visions carry weight, largely because Facebook now has more than 2 billion users and plays an influential role in how people communicate. But VR so far has been embraced mostly by video game lovers, despite Facebook\u2019s efforts to bring the technology into the mainstream since buying Oculus for $2bn three years ago. Facebook has shaken up the Oculus management team since then in a series of moves that included the departure of its founder, Palmer Luckey, earlier this year. The former Google executive Hugo Barra now oversees Facebook\u2019s VR operations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
