But the market is still dominated by two of the world\u2019s oldest sales houses: 253-year-old Christie\u2019s, and Sotheby\u2019s \u2013 which turned 275 this year. Despite a flurry of online art sales startups launching over the past decade, many with the aim of disrupting the art world in the style of Spotify or Amazon, it\u2019s still business as usual where the real money is. Most of the work sold by online art companies last year was under $5,000 (\u00a33,900), with less than 10% above $250,000, according this year\u2019s UBS/Art Basel Art Market Report. \u201cThere was all this talk about disrupting the market, that this was the end of the market and that everything was going to move online,\u201d says Clare McAndrew, author of the Art Market Report. \u201cIn terms of disrupting, [online startups] haven\u2019t really made the impact or overthrown the incumbents.\u201d There have of course been technological advances in the way art is bought and sold. Some art fairs, galleries and sites have started trading in bitcoin and using blockchain as a way of authenticating artworks. You can buy a share in a Warhol or a Monet for less than \u00a320 through blockchain-based online platforms. The global online art market grew 9.8% in aggregate in 2018 to $4.64bn , according to the 2019 Hiscox Online Art Trade Report. But the four online art platforms most trusted by buyers are Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s, Phillips and Bonhams, the report says, while forecasting \u201cconsolidation and casualties\u201d among the new online startups in an overcrowded market. When it comes to high-stakes investments, collectors prefer to stay within the art establishment. \u201cCollectors feel safer with the traditional established brands which give you a great peace of mind with the whole process, due diligence, authenticity, payment terms etc,\u201d says London-based art adviser and collector Daniel Turriani. Sebastian Cwilich, the co-founder of New York-based art platform Artsy, believes many startups failed because the business is so complex and rooted in tradition. \u201cAround the time we started, a lot of business launched with us,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of those no longer exist or are much smaller.\u201d Artsy partners with auction houses, galleries and art fairs to sell works on its site. \u201cWe always believed that the \u2018we\u2019re going to replace everything and do it better ourselves\u2019 approach wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Marion Maneker, industry expert and publisher of Art Market Monitor, notes that there was a misguided assumption that people would buy art online sight unseen, like clothes or grocery shopping. \u201cArt\u2019s never been a retail business for the simple fact that art is not a necessary item. Art\u2019s a wonderful thing but not a real requirement,\u201d he says. In his view, the market\u2019s biggest disruption happened a long time ago with the advent of email. \u201cAs soon as BlackBerries could handle a jpeg, people were buying and selling off of that.\u201d Tawn Albright, a US-based tech executive who led the expansion of online gallery Saatchi Art into art fairs, says new platforms have helped open up the art world. \u201cI spend hours on Invaluable [an art sales site] looking at things that would normally go out to auction. I don\u2019t have to wait for the special invite,\u201d he says. But, according to Michal Szczesny, chief executive of UK-based Artfinder, the high end is still a relatively closed shop. \u201cThe transparency of pricing and democracy of online selling is not something that suits the high end of the market or its collectors, who very much enjoy the physical VIP experience they receive through traditional auction houses,\u201d he says. The art trade revolves around a network of relationships between auction houses, dealers, gallerists, collectors and advisers, presenting another barrier to entry. \u201cAlthough information flow has been accelerated by the internet, email and Instagram, in many ways the art world remains quite old-fashioned and undemocratic,\u201d says Teresa Krasny, a London-based art adviser. \u201cPersonal relationships between the collector and the major players are established over time.\u201d But there\u2019s a new generation of art buyers who are more comfortable purchasing art online. The Hiscox report found that 29% of millennial buyers surveyed said they preferred to buy art online, compared with 14% a year ago. Big auction houses use their online platforms to attract new buyers. \u201cIn future, the number one auction house will be the one that\u2019s right now bringing in the next generation of collectors. Digital is where they are coming in,\u201d says Matt Rubringer, Christies\u2019 deputy chief marketing officer. AI continues to infiltrate the art world and, as well as creating artworks, is being used to predict what art buyers want. This year Sotheby\u2019s acquired Thread Genius, a startup that personalises recommendations to clients using image recognition. But the tech is a long way from replacing human specialists. \u201cSerious collectors generally have a clear sense of their acquisition goals. Their approach, which can be both intellectual and emotional, doesn\u2019t lend itself easily to the product of an algorithm,\u201d says Krasny. Machine learning is also being used in the push for greater transparency around pricing, with an image-recognition app called Magnus allowing users to see the cost of certain artworks by pointing a phone at them. The industry is notoriously opaque when it comes to revealing prices, which is a concern for online buyers and hinders the growth of the digital art trade. \u201cUntil prices are transparent, I think the upper echelon of the art market will continue to hold its own,\u201d says Albright. In a sector where secrecy and exclusivity are considered vital components to doing deals, would-be disruptors have a battle on their hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
