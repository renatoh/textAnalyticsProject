Jon Trew, by email Wow. A tremendous response to this question so far. Thanks to everyone for contributing to such a constructive discussion. I'm pleased to see that I am not alone in being a bit of a heating anorak. There are many potential strands here to discuss, but it's probably best if we concentrate on the topics that have generated the most heat. (Pun intended.) So let's start with the siting of radiators. Should they be placed under a window or not? Victoriatheoldgoth didn't seem convinced by the current convention of sticking radiators under windows: \"It seems to be a great way of heating the outside world, when the curtains are closed.\" Bluespring kindly responded with the observation that \"I heard somewhere that radiators are deliberately fitted under windows as the colder air just above helps to convect the hot air up and into the room, and colder air in the room swoops back toward the radiator, setting up a cycle of warm air in the room.\" I agreed with Errr who remarked that \"it's just the fact that people tend to put furniture against walls\". So I asked the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to adjudicate on this matter as it does seem to be a common query about modern central heating systems. A spokesperson responded: Traditionally, radiators have been located under windows for comfort reasons. A radiator sets up a convection current which circulates air around the room. Consider two cases: 1) Window against the wall opposite a single glazed window: The air rises above the radiator and moves out towards the window, cools and falls down the opposite side of the room. The air close to a single glazed window can be quite cool and this cooler air will be dragged down into the centre of the room, reducing comfort. 2) Window against the wall below a single glazed window: The air rises above the radiator taking the cool air with it up to the top of the room, the warmer air starts to cool and falls down the opposite side of the room but there isn't cold air to drag into the centre of the room so it is more comfortable However, now that double glazing is quite prevalent, this isn't such a problem so radiators can be put in most places in the room. You just need to make sure the radiator is unobstructed so that the air can flow freely around it (definitely no shelves and try to make sure that curtains are cut to hang higher than the top of the radiator and held flush against the wall). The issue of radiator boosters, or foil liners, also led to some hearty discussion. Sparerib seemed convinced they were worth the effort, especially on outside walls: \"We made our own for next to nothing. All you need is a piece of cardboard cut to slip behind the radiator, stick polystyrene tiles on it and cover with tin foil.\" PeteinSQ and janeinalberta agreed. As did the EST spokesperson: Radiator panels do work, but we recommend the real deal, not just a bit of foil. You only need to put them behind radiators against heat loss (external) walls, not internal walls. They work much better on solid walls and uninsulated cavity walls (but then these should be insulated). The effect is reduced with insulated cavity walls. But perhaps the most contentious discussion of all was the issue raised by Martinthehack. Should heating be left on low 24/7, or should it be timed to come on only when you need it? \"I've been leaving the central heating on 24/7 during the winter for a number of years now with the temperature left at 17/18c,\" said Martinthehack. \"The result is lower bills and the house always warm.\" Not many people seemed to be buying this argument. (Thanks to squareroot for providing some back-of-the-envelope figures.) A rare voice of support was fridihem who described their home in Sweden: \"Super insulation, triple glazed windows, and a heating system that is always on 24/7, controlled by outside thermostat, which in turn controls the indoor computer on my district heating system heat exchanger. This is a small unit, about the size of a microwave, no noise, no smell, no emissions, and the house is always about +21.\" This reminded me of a so-called \"passive\" house I visited last year just south of Dublin. Sure, if the home is super efficient then it might make sense, but who really has triple-glazed windows in the UK? It probably amounts to no more than a few thousand homes at best. The reality is that the UK's housing stock is, by and large, grossly inefficient and leaky. To leave your heating on all day, even down low, in any home that doesn't meet the very highest efficiency standards would be equivalent to burning money for fun. A few years ago I toured a home in Kent with an energy efficiency advisor and he said to me that the \"I leave my heating on all day\" myth was the one he heard the most often from householders. But he was adamant that it was, indeed, a myth. The EST spokesperson seemed to agree, too: Leaving a radiator on all day is not efficient. We recommend getting to know your heating system and be aware of how long it takes to warm up and cool down your home. We have some great tips on our website to get the most out of your heating system. But, personally, I particularly enjoyed LongFlap's advice: \"Thermals from Uniqlo, chunky ethnic fleece-lined woolly hoodies from the market, and a session on the turbo (indoor bicycle trainer) for when it's really icy outside and in. My heating doesn't go on before 6 pm, but then I'm hard (more like a tight-fisted masochist in reality).\" Please do keep this discussion going over this festive period, especially if temperatures where you are remain low. Thanks again for some excellent contributions. Merry Christmas. On 21 December Leo originally wrote: As central heating is now the most common set-up in most UK homes, I'm guessing that's what you have and therefore you have a boiler of some description and radiators throughout the home. (For those with a \"real fire\", please read my previous article on that subject.) There are a number of ways to increase the efficiency of your system, ranging from bleeding radiators and installing radiator boosters, through to regularly maintaining the boiler. But just how much impact do each of these measures have? Please share your own thoughts and experiences below. And any other thoughts on how best to reduce fuel bills over winter are most welcome too. I'll be back later in the week to sift through your ideas and add some of my own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
