Not that long ago it might have seemed a step too far to hope that you could get a group of players together from four countries, give them about a month together and then expect them to take on the world champions in their own backyard. Now, after the Lions have been together for less than a week, it doesn't seem that fanciful any longer. There's a buzz in camp. The first team has been announced, players are getting to grips with life at altitude but, in particular, I have been amazed how the Lions have come together since we left our base in Surrey last Sunday. Not so long ago we were knocking lumps out of each other in the Six Nations and even more recently there have been some pretty physical encounters in the Heineken Cup, but you can look long and hard and still not find divided loyalties in this camp. Look around the tables at meal times and they are all a mixture of English, Irish, Welsh and Scottish. During the down times you don't find little groups of Welsh or English. And, most importantly, everyone seems to have bought in to one core feeling. I suppose if anyone was going to get the formula right, then it had to be Ian McGeechan. The man is on his fifth trip as a Lions coach and his seventh in total, so he knows a bit about touring and has ordained that this be an old-fashioned \u2013 old-school if you like \u2013 tour, the kind that he has seen work in the past. Forget what might have happened in 2001 and 2005, the Lions of 2009 are back mixing the serious business of Test rugby with learning as much as possible about the country in which we are touring. Wednesday was the perfect example of life with the Lions on many levels, public and private. Mindful of our limited numbers and the injuries suffered before we even left Britain, training has been tailored to avoid the kind of damage done to Jerry Flannery's elbow, but you can't pussyfoot around for ever and Wednesday had to be the most brutal practice so far. It had to be done, because leaving it any longer would have risked a welter of injuries close to the first Test. Anyway, there were bumps and bruises, thankfully none of them serious enough to be a problem or to delay the afternoon helicopter trip to a township just south of Johannesburg, which was mind-blowing for anyone who does not know the scale of these things. We were there to open a multi-purpose sports pitch and went armed with a pocketful of Lions pins to give away. Unfortunately not even a sackful would have met demand and the rollercoaster day continued back at our base where another layer of Lions expertise was found wanting. All across the squad committees have been formed, some with greater success than others. Donncha O'Callaghan, for example, appears involved in most things and particularly the administration of justice. I won't explain it now, but don't be surprised if you see the odd Lion sprouting facial hair or perhaps glowing in the dark after being painted with fake tan. The whys and wherefores will have to wait for another day, but it is enough to know that some of these committees fast become integral to life in camp. Less so, I'm afraid, is the one I'm involved with. It's charged with coming up with a decent bet every day of the tour and on Wednesday night we advised going a bundle on the game in Rome, in particular, a banker bet on the first half remaining goalless. Obviously Samuel Eto'o sent our money down the drain, but thankfully some of the punters remembered other more successful tips and generally morale is sky high. That, though, is probably down to one of the more serious points Ian hammered home even before he set about selecting his squad. Months ago, when we started looking at players, he promised to pick solely on form and the tour party has been told that he doesn't intend changing that policy now we are in South Africa. Yesterday the 22 for tomorrow's tour opener in Rustenburg were announced. The promise is that by the time we have played the Golden Lions in Johannesburg and the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein, everyone will have been involved and everyone will have had a chance to shine and catch Ian's eye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
