In contrast for Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel, what has already been a difficult weekend looks set to end only in another largely thankless slog on Sunday afternoon after he could manage only seventh. Indeed, such was the gap between Mercedes and Ferrari, for the first time this season Hamilton clearly indicated his battle for the title was now with his teammate Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton has 86 career poles. This is his third this season and with five wins already his form here suggests another is well within his grasp. He is, as he put it in France, firing on all cylinders. Calm and collected enough to put in an almost flawless performance with equanimity. Hamilton delivered a piece of controlled, precision driving to secure pole with two clinical laps. He had set the pace with a strong opener on the first hot runs in Q3 with a time of 1 minute 28.488 seconds. On their second outings, Hamilton found another level altogether; he was almost half a second up, but for losing time at the last two corners. He still had enough, however, and concluded with a 1m 28.319sec lap, a track record. Bottas was almost three-tenths back in second but Mercedes were in a different class. Charles Leclerc finished in third for Ferrari, sixth-tenths down. Hamilton has a 29-point advantage over Bottas and is 62 points clear of Vettel. Ferrari trail Mercedes by 123 points in the constructors\u2019 championship and, with 14 races remaining, for the first time this season there appeared to be an admission from Hamilton that his focus is now on his teammate in the title fight. \u201cI do feel strong, each weekend I feel I start on the right foot but Valtteri goes in and puts in bloody good laps every time,\u201d he said. \u201cI am constantly being pushed by Valtteri.\u201d Hamilton has talked up Ferrari\u2019s challenge until now but after Mercedes dominated all weekend in France, he appeared to now consider it a two-horse chase. \u201cThere are some races where we as a team have not been pushed as hard as we would like to be by the others,\u201d he said. \u201cNonetheless there is still the battle within us. \u201cIn a lot of the races there has been half a tenth to a tenth and a half between Valtteri and I. So I still have my work cut out, I still have to perform, still have to deliver. The work ethic is exactly the same, the stress is exactly the same as if we were fighting with the Ferraris.\u201d Of concern for Bottas, however, was that Hamilton knows he is entering the period of the year when his form generally only improves. \u201cIt usually gets better when I get to this point of the season,\u201d he added. \u201cI am definitely getting more comfortable with the car. I don\u2019t expect that to stop.\u201d Ferrari and Vettel, however, have faced a weekend that reflects their season. Vettel had been given a five-second penalty after he was pressured into an error by Hamilton and went off at the last round in Canada. The team have since pursued a review of the decision which was summarily dismissed by the stewards on Friday. They were left angry and disappointed, although what they had cited as \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence in their favour turned out to be distinctly underwhelming and was judged to be irrelevant. Hamilton\u2019s reaction at learning Ferrari were putting forward Sky pundit\u2019s Karun Chandhok\u2019s analysis as part of their case perhaps summed up the weakness of the Scuderia\u2019s position. \u201cI heard it was Karun Chandhok\u2019s video that was the new evidence so I was pretty relaxed after that,\u201d he said to considerable laughter. Unsettled as Ferrari have been by underperforming all season, they have reeled from errors, bad luck and an inability to catch or better Mercedes even when they have an advantage. In France, Vettel had to abort his first hot lap after he went wide when he missed an upshift at turn nine and then just could not find the grip on his last shot in Q3. As inconsistency has dogged his and Ferrari\u2019s season, so it had blighted his qualifying. \u201cI am not happy with that and not happy to not extract the maximum today,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not have a good feel for the car. It is the inconsistency that made it difficult. Some laps it felt really good, others didn\u2019t.\u201d Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen was in fourth, but there was a real shot in the arm for McLaren. Britain\u2019s Lando Norris put in a superb lap to take the highest grid position of his F1 career in fifth, one place ahead of his more experienced teammate, Spain\u2019s Carlos Sainz. Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was in eighth, Red Bull\u2019s Pierre Gasly in ninth and Antonio Giovinazzi in the Alfa Romeo was in 10th. Alexander Albon was in 11th for Toro Rosso, with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in 12th for Alfa Romeo in front of the Renault of Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Racing Point\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez and the Haas of Kevin Magnussen. Daniil Kvyat was in 15th for Toro Rosso in front of the Haas of Romain Grosjean and the Racing Point of Lance Stroll. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th for Williams. Russell will start form the back of the grid for an ERS change and Kyvat will be in 19 after a penalty for taking a new power unit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
