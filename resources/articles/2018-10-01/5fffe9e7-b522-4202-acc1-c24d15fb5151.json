Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City side face Tottenham at Wembley on Monday night. City\u2019s manager made the comment about Kane following the win against Chelsea last September. Mauricio Pochettino branded Guardiola disrespectful for seeming to suggest Spurs were a one-man side, but Guardiola disputed this, saying he meant only that Kane had been scoring consistently. This context was mentioned to Guardiola when it was put to him that Tottenham, who are two points behind City, have shown this season they can perform when Kane does not score. He said: \u201cThey have shown me how wrong I was.\u201d Given how close Spurs are to City the manager is aware of how vital matches may be against direct title rivals. \u201cWhen you play against the contenders it\u2019s almost six points, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cThese are important. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened in the past but it\u2019s true that the strong teams are making a lot of points; they are not dropping points easily. That\u2019s why maybe the games against the contenders are becoming so important. \u201cWe\u2019ve started with three games away against them [Arsenal and Liverpool, previously]. That\u2019s why it is so important to take those points. But nothing is going to change. Southampton is then next at home \u2013 the same points [are available, as against Tottenham]. \u201cThe first year we dropped a lot of points against contenders. Except at Anfield and United at home, we won all of these games in the second season. The reality is what we\u2019ve done last year shows you have to be focused on everyone. We had 100 points because we were focused on all the games.\u201d Guardiola also suggested Spurs perform better at White Hart Lane, which is being rebuilt, than at Wembley. \u201cTottenham feel more comfortable at home. That is going to happen in your stadium. We are more comfortable at the Etihad Stadium.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
