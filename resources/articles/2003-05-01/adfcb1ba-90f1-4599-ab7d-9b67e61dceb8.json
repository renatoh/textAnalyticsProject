That's a remarkable achievement for an actor who'd only just been installed in Hollywood's $20 million club. Or should that be reinstalled? Five years before, he'd rocketed to the top table thanks to the summer-long success of Speed. Co-star Sandra Bullock parlayed her sidekick role into superstardom. Keanu? He made Chain Reaction and Johnny Mnemonic. And lived. In the five years since Matrix I, he's given us Sweet November, The Replacements and Hard Ball. For these we should not thank him, either. And here come those questions: Does any other actor work this hard at lowering his stock between blockbusters? Does he actually give a toss about his career? And the ones that never go away: Can he act? Is he some sort of idiot savant? Or should we subtract the \"savant\"? What could have possessed him to do Hamlet in Winnipeg? Is he, finally, more than a Whoa-man? I liked Keanu much better when I was absolutely sure he was an idiot, but I've always had my doubts. Within certain narrow parameters, he's a competent actor blessed with mesmerising screen presence, and his early, stoner-stoopid roles in Bill And Ted and Parenthood are a joy to revisit. But once he gets his Hamlet hat on, and tries hanging out with the big boys - Shakespeare in My Own Private Idaho, a Luciferian Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate - he often starts to look like nothing more than a particularly lush aspect of the production design. On the other hand, once you tidy him up a bit, put some muscles on him and let him intone portentous monosyllables, as he does in The Matrix, he starts looking rather like an American icon. He's the face of the zeitgeist once again, but will he blow it third time around as well? Career high I take my Keanu early and stoned: Bill And Ted (but especially KR's \"Evil Ted\" in Bogus Journey), also his funny-horrific, \"butt-reamin' asshole\" scene in Parenthood, and all of Point Break, especially when he screams at Patrick Swayze, \"I am an EFF! BEE! EYE! Agent!\" Career low He spends most of his time on a plateau of lowness, occasionally rising up from the wreckage (of movies like Sweet November or A Walk In The Clouds) and back into our affections. Then he holds his nose and goes under again. Need to know His estranged dad served two years of a 10-year bit for selling heroin. His mum was Alice Cooper's clothes designer for a spell. And yes, Keanu dropped out of high school. The last word \"I'm a meathead man. You've got smart people, and you've got dumb people. I just happen to be dumb.\" From the man himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
