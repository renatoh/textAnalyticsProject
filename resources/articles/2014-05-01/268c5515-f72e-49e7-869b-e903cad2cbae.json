Now there is news, as there is every so often, that a new way of keeping the ship of life away from the rocky reef that will one day sink it is under study. It involves mice, as it usually does, and it involves something that might be ready for use on humans many years from now. This, too, is always the case. Before we pin our hopes on the crock of gold at the end of this rainbow, shouldn't we ask whether old age is all that bad? It can't be abolished. No doubt it can be improved. Indeed, it has been improved, but the facts suggest that the two most important things at this time of life, as at all the other times of life, are luck and love. Mice, unfortunately, cannot transmit these qualities. It is a blessing to have reached old age, so there is some luck there already. It would certainly be nice if old age were healthier but, on the other hand, it would be terrible to spend one's old age desperately trying to be young."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
