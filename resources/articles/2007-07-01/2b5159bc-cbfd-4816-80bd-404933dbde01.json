Did no one tell the EOC about sport? Over to the golf for a bout of good old-fashioned sexist banter. Thanks to Wayne Grady for this classic from Carnoustie, addressed to his fellow commentator Maureen Madill who, rather controversially in the 21st century, turns out to be a woman. We were on the 16th, and Madill was cued to speak. Grady talked over her and Madill continued. An incy-wincy cock-up. \"It's like talking to my wife,\" he said. Which could, of course, mean \"I love you, I treasure you, you inspire and enrich me like my beloved\". But is more likely to mean \"nag, nag, nag, nag nag, just like 'er indoors, can't get a bleedin' word in edgeways\". \"Good job you were a long way from me when you said that,\" Madill replied, with a hint of steel in her softly-softly voice. \"You'll need to buy me a drink for that when we get back in.\" At which point veteran provocateur Peter Alliss threw in his threepence worth. \"That's nothing compared to what he's going to have to do for his wife!\" Is this how far we've come? Is this what Emily Davison threw herself in front of a horse for, what our sisters camped out at Greenham for, what Beth Ditto took her knickers off for? I think not. The world of sport, as my good friend Dickie Davies used to call it, is a parallel universe - one in which men play and drink together, and women exist only as remote derogatory reference points and baby incubators. If Bernard Manning were still around, he'd be a no-brainer for a top commentating job. (\"Nice lob from the black lass with the knockers!\") A couple of years ago, Gary Lineker at the Sports Personality of the year surpassed himself, when he segued back to Sue Barker after phwoooarghing Zara Phillips with the elegant link, \"And now for more posh totty . . . Sue!\" This year as the Sex Discrimination Act finally found its way to Wimbledon, John Inverdale whined that men play five sets so of course they should get more money than the women. (On that basis, presumably he'd argue 100-metre runners should get paid a fraction of what marathon runners get.) That time, it took the Beeb's very best, John McEnroe, to put him right - no men, he said, could have provided the quality of entertainment both Williams sisters had. When the BBC did try to get it right, by hiring a female Match of the Day commentator, Jacqui Oatley, their own pundit Lee Dixon only went and pissed on their progressive chips with \"Didn't she do well\". Meanwhile, that cerebral philosopher of the game Dave Bassett announced he would be switching stations because female commentators simply weren't right. Another manager, Luton Town's Mike Newell, criticised the appointment of female official Amy Rayner with the measured, \"If you start bringing in women, you have big problems . . . I know that sounds sexist but I am sexist.\" Ah, that's OK then. Way back in the last century Rodney Marsh wise-cracked, \"Of course, there is a role for women in football - otherwise who will make the half-time tea?\" Stone-age views have been expressed since, well, the stone age. The problem is that the world has changed, but sport has not kept pace. The commentators and managers are only an expression of entrenched sporting attitudes at large. At least women are allowed to talk about sport these days - Barker, Madill, Oatley, Clare Balding, Hazel Irvine, all do a fine job for the Beeb, despite the banter. Playing or officiating appears to be a different matter. It is unbelievable that in 2007, we do not have champion women jockeys, ditto grand prix drivers, ditto snooker players. If anything, women appear to be more excluded than ever. While there is more sport on TV, thanks to Uncle Rupert and his money-making machine, less and less appears to involve women. As a child I could tell you that Rachel Heyhoe-Flint was the captain of the England women's cricket team, 15 years ago I knew that Allison Fisher was snooker's greatest player. Nowadays, I haven't got a clue who their modern-day equivalents are. Disturbingly, women only appear to have profile if they have the temerity to take on men at their own game - so Michelle Wie is ridiculed for her failure to compete on the men's circuit, while Serena Williams is mocked for her muscles. Sport is dominated by a bunch of macho men running scared. It is in danger of becoming the last bastion of institutionalised misogyny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
