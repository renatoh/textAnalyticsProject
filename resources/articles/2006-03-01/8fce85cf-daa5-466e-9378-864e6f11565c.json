The arrival of Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell and TV presenter Ben Fogle in Antigua at the end of January after 49 days of rowing across the Atlantic offered us all the perfect excuse to run front-page photos of two well formed half-naked men. Most of the reports, with an eye more on titillation than any representation of the experience, concentrated on their claim that they had rowed naked to prevent 'chafing'. Cracknell and Fogle were rowing for Children in Need - a worthy cause, though one that increasingly speaks more of celebrity than charity. Then it emerged that a BBC series about the pair's progress was in the pipeline, while their website states that a publisher will bring out 'the only account of this unbelievable undertaking in time for Christmas 2006'. I can't wait. Cracknell soon announced his retirement from rowing, in a newspaper 'exclusive', to which the only response could be: 'Hadn't he already done that?' It would be nice to think that Fogle will return to the soporific cosiness of daytime TV and Animal Park. I suspect, however, that he has an eye on 'greater things'. If you thought Craig Doyle on Grandstand was irritating ... As it happens, the Atlantic Rowing Race was not all about posh young men with books to sell going off on awfully big adventures. Five days after the British pair, the Bout de Vie boat came in, manned by two Frenchman, Frank Bruno (no, seriously) and Dominique Benassi. Bruno had lost his right leg while serving with the French army in Lebanon in 1983; Benassi, a fireman, had lost his right leg after being accidentally shot. Theirs was truly an unbelievable achievement and they finished ahead of 16 able-bodied crews. Did you learn about this on the front pages? No."}, "isHosted": false}}}
