Could we be seeing an outbreak of morality among the corporate elite? Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, announced last week that he is sharing out his \u00a32.4m bonus among his retailer's 19,400 staff; the head of one of Austria's biggest banks \u2013 Herbert Stepic of Raiffeisen \u2013 has handed back \u00a31.2m of his pay on the grounds that he is overpaid; and the incoming head of miner BHP Billiton, Andrew Mackenzie has taken a 25% cut to his salary. In these austere times \u2013 GDP data next week will show whether the UK has sunk into an unprecedented triple-dip recession \u2013 an acknowledgement by top bosses that they are overpaid should be embraced. Or should it? Take Mackenzie of Billiton. Even with the 25% cut in his pay, his salary is still \u00a31.1m before any bonuses. Wolfson, a Tory peer and Conservative party donor, still enjoyed a 13% rise in basic pay to \u00a34.6m at Next (the store's staff got 2%). The Austrian bank boss still walked away with more than \u00a32m. And, as is usual with executive pay, there are many more bosses grasping for more. The attempts at restraint demonstrated by BHP's boss contrast sharply with the behaviour of Xstrata's departing Mick Davis. He is walking away with \u00a375m as a result of the takeover by Glencore \u2013 a staggering \u00a39.6m of which is to be handed to him in cash rather than shares. Similarly, compare Stepic's gesture of goodwill with Barclays, where the much-welcomed retirement of Rich Ricci seems unlikely to stop millions of pounds of previously awarded bonus deals continuing to flow to him as he enjoys his retirement \u2013 which is beginning at the age of 49. Ricci is a symbol of anything but restraint. This is the man who was handed \u00a317m under the cover of this year's budget \u2013 when Barclays seemed to hope attention would be focused on the chancellor's speech \u2013 taking his earnings since 2010 to over \u00a370m. The announcement of Ricci's retirement came just a few days before the bank's annual meeting with investors this Thursday. The hope is that it will take the heat out of an uncomfortable few hours for new chief executive Antony Jenkins. Remember the fuss last year\u2013 even before the Libor crisis had struck \u2013 when Bob Diamond was at the helm? Diamond also had unimaginable wealth but was determined to take a bonus for 2011. Almost a third of Barclays investors failed to support the remuneration report. That rebellion heralded last year's \"shareholder spring\", during which an unprecedented number of remuneration reports were voted down and a number of bosses ousted after years of being overpaid for underperformance. There are signs that this year could see a replay. Standard Life has angrily criticised the pay policies at BP, and fund manager Jupiter \u2013 which itself polices pay policies \u2013 suffered a serious humiliation on Thursday, when 42% of investors failed to back its own remuneration report. Corporate governance expert Manifest reckons that any dissent of more than 10% is something for a management team to worry about. Governments keen to pass the buck on the pay controversy point at shareholders to keep a lid on pay excess, but non-executive directors have at least an equal responsibility. Bonus schemes that pay out so much that their bosses are embarrassed to take the proceeds should never have been approved. Directors on remuneration committees need to think much longer and harder about how bonuses are handed out. And then there are the executives themselves. Wolfson, Stepic and Mackenzie are to be applauded. But the loudest cheer should be reserved for those executives ready to acknowledge that they do the job to their best ability regardless of the bonus attached. Shell's former chief, Jeroen van der Veer, once admitted his work would have been the same regardless of his bonus arrangements. Surely he cannot be the only one. Npower's tax bill may be justified, but its record isn't glowing Almost 90,000 people have put their names to an online petition for RWE npower to pay more corporation tax more in line with the rest of the business community. Revelations last week that npower \u2013 one of the Big Six energy providers \u2013 had paid \"almost nothing\" (just \u00a35m) over three years understandably infuriated many. Comparisons have been made with Starbucks, which faced similar protests and eventually decided to make a \u00a320m ex gratia payment to the taxman. Will npower have to do the same? Maybe, but the energy company is in a rather different position from the US-based coffee chain, not least because it has invested much more heavily in Britain. The German-owned company has spent almost \u00a35bn over recent years putting in place new gas-fired power stations and wind farms. Npower is legitimately able to write off some of the cost of those investments against its profits in Britain, where it has more than 6.5 million gas and electricity customers. Certainly, Britain needs new lower-carbon power stations rather more urgently than it needs caramel macchiatos. It is more vulnerable to criticism over an estimated \u00a3350m of \"interest payments\" from the British company to the German parent. Npower argues that this is just good business: the British arm can borrow money for infrastructure building more cheaply from its colleagues in Essen. But critics, including crusading tax experts such as Richard Murphy, say there is no difference between such \"interest\" and the \"royalties\" paid by Starbucks for use of the brand name, which triggered the coffee crisis. And there is still no need for any of the Big Six to give regulator Ofgem anything other than retail and generation profits. Yet sitting in between these two are big trading divisions. The real problem is that npower and the rest have been tarnished by a string of Ofgem fines, criticism over tariffs that seem designed to baffle, and some executive pay excess. Few feel inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt when a tax row breaks. Departing lingerie boss leaves Bolland looking exposed The sudden departure of Marks &amp; Spencer's lingerie boss 12 weeks after her much-heralded arrival means at least six senior bosses at the ailing retailer have recently quit. When Janie Schaffer was recruited, her appointment was described as \"inspirational\" . Dubbed \"the knicker queen\", she had learned her trade in the M&amp;S undies department, founded the Knickerbox chain in 1986 and for the past five years had been creative director at Victoria's Secret in the US, injecting new glamour that has helped to haul the brand out of the doldrums. M&amp;S sources say that Schaffer had come to the end of a three-month probation period \u2013 with the clear suggestion that she wasn't up to the job. Schaffer's supporters say she didn't have a probation period and quit because she wasn't allowed to make even basic decisions, such as new packaging for women's tights. Who to believe? Who knows. But a little of the Victoria's Secret sparkle would have been welcome at M&amp;S, where sales of clothing and homewares have been falling for the past seven quarters. Chief executive Marc Bolland should be worried: the executive exit door is revolving fast, and he might soon find himself spinning through it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
