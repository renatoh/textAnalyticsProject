But, while there's no doubting Kautzman's compassionate concern, his 90-minute play tends to circle round the issue rather than addressing it head-on. It's difficult to describe the play without revealing the moral dilemma it poses. All I can say is that it takes the form of a fraught family reunion in which an elderly couple invite their grownup children to what looks like a Christmas dinner even though it is only mid-June. Gene, the dad, has an unspecified terminal illness, and his wife, Mary, who periodically lapses into fantasies of being a Sumerian fertility goddess, has only the shakiest grasp on reality. Together they have made a big decision which they announce to Robert, a recovering addict, and their adopted daughter, Melissa, who is into tantric healing. At this point you expect the play to open up a discussion of the ethical, practical and social problems attending the right to die. But, although there is a good deal of sibling argument and some sharp dialogue \u2013 including Melissa's dismissal of care homes as \"waiting-rooms for the half dead\" \u2013 the play never really gets to grips with the big issue: it's as if Kautzman has planted the subject in our midst and evaded its implications. You certainly can't fault the acting in Max Pappenheim's production. Susan Tracy's Mary excellently combines momentary lucidity with a sense of inhabiting a world of her own, Martin Wimbush is all baffled concern as her husband, and Cory English and Lisa Caruccio Came play their adult offspring with the right resentful tenderness. Kautzman has written a perfectly good family play, with palpable echoes of O'Neill. I just wish he'd done more to challenge our assumptions about how best to achieve a dignified exit from life. \u2022 Until 12 July. Box office: 0844 847 1652. Venue: Finborough theatre, London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
