On Monday the 25-year-old footballer from Melbourne, a Bahraini refugee, was remanded in prison for another two months after the Ratchadaphisek criminal court gave him 60 days to prepare a defence to Bahrain\u2019s extradition request. Speaking after the hearing, the Thai prosecutor confirmed that the country\u2019s attorney general has powers of executive discretion and could return Al-Araibi to Australia at any point. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the Australian government remained \u201cdeeply concerned by his ongoing detention\u201d and continued to advocate \u201cat the highest levels\u201d in Thailand and Bahrain. \u201cThe Australian government reiterates its calls for the Thai government to release Hakeem al-Araibi home to Australia to be with his friends and family following his extradition hearing,\u201d Payne said. \u201cBoth governments are aware of the importance of this matter to the Australian government and Australian people.\u201d At Monday\u2019s court hearing Al-Araibi was brought to the court barefoot, in prison clothes, with his legs shackled. As he walked past media and supporters he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t send me to Bahrain.\u201d On Tuesday evening the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said seeing Al-Araibi in shackles had prompted him to write to Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a second time, after first writing last week to call for Al-Araibi to be sent back to Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve written to him again, because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day,\u201d Morrison told Sky News. \u201cHe was shackled and I thought that was very upsetting and I know it would have upset many Australians. \u201cI\u2019m respectfully reminding the Thai prime minister that Australians feel very strongly about this, very very strongly.\u201d The images, which were broadcast internationally, have also upset Thai people. Thai media is not permitted to show prisoners in restraints and local outlets including the Bangkok Post airbrushed the shackles out of pictures. \u201cI think this is causing an outrage because a lot of international media are on this story and Thai people don\u2019t want to see Thailand treating prisoners like this,\u201d a senior Thai journalist said. The corrections department\u2019s director general, Police Colonel Narat Sawatanan, said the restraints were not \u201cshackles\u201d because they could be locked and unlocked, and defended the decision to use them on Al-Araibi by saying there was a lot of public interest in the case. \u201cIt is our duty to transport prisoners to prevent them from fleeing,\u201d he said. Al-Araibi fears he will be imprisoned and tortured \u2013 as he alleges occurred in 2012 \u2013 if he is returned. The Bahraini government bases its extradition request on an act of vandalism which occurred when, or very shortly after, he was playing in a televised football match, but Al-Araibi believes it is attempted political retribution. \u201cThe Thai government should see that Bahrain\u2019s sole motive is to further punish Hakeem for the peaceful political opinions he expressed,\u201d said an Amnesty International Thailand campaigner, Katherine Gerson. Supporters of Al-Araibi have stepped up calls for sanctions and boycotts \u2013 primarily imposed by world sporting bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee \u2013 against Bahrain and Thailand. \u201cYou cannot have the privileges of the international community if you are not prepared to live by its rules or behave by its standards,\u201d said the head of Professional Footballers Australia, John Didulica. Allan McKinnon, Australia\u2019s ambassador-designate, would not be drawn on whether Australia was considering sanctions against Thailand if it failed to act. \u201cWhat we are considering at the moment is anything we can do to more rapidly move Hakeem al-Araibi out of detention, have this case finished and allow him to go back to Australia,\u201d McKinnon said outside the court. He said Australia and the other 14 countries represented in court to support Al-Araibi would \u201ccontinue to press\u201d. Pressure on Thailand is increasing, and its head of immigration, Surachate Hakparn, personally responded to criticism of Al-Araibi\u2019s shackles and bare feet at court on Monday. Hakparn replied to numerous tweets to say it was in line with international standards \u2013 something disputed by human rights groups. On Tuesday morning Hakparn tweeted a screenshot of McKinnon\u2019s statement, posted by the Australian embassy in Thailand. He added the words: \u201cWe hope that Hakeem will be able to go back to be with his family and his wife in the coming days.\u201d The posted comment, on behalf of McKinnon, said the actions of Bahrain had put Thailand \u201cin a very difficult position\u201d. \u201cThe government of Bahrain knew very well that Hakeem al-Araibi lived in Australia since 2014. During these four years, the Bahraini government did not attempt to ask Australia about Hakeem at all or to request to send him back to Bahrain.\u201d The role of Australian authorities in Al-Araibi\u2019s arrest has become a key question, and supporters have said that while they are now concentrating on getting him released, they would seek accountability when the ordeal was over. He was arrested in November on an Interpol red notice, issued against Interpol\u2019s refugee protection policies. Australian federal police, working as locally based Interpol, notified Thailand of his arrival \u2013 a process that is understood to be largely automatic when someone subject to a red notice is travelling \u2013 and did not flag his refugee status. Al-Araibi has said he asked Australian government officials if he was safe to travel and was told he would be. Speaking to 2GB radio at the weekend, Morrison suggested Al-Araibi bore some responsibility. \u201cIf you have a permanent protection visa and you live in Australia, please don\u2019t go to countries where you can put yourself at risk in these situations,\u201d he said. Asked by the host, Alan Jones, about Australian officials \u201ctipping off\u201d Thai authorities, Morrison said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on is getting him home.\u201d While Payne and diplomatic staff have lobbied on behalf of Al-Araibi since his arrest, Morrison personally intervened only last week, speaking to the Thai ambassador and writing to the Thai prime minister. He told 2GB he was yet to receive a reply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
