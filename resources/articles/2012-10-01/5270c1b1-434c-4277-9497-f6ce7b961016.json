Councils must spearhead new policy agendas while keeping pace with growing demand for services and delivering deep spending cuts. It's a tough ask. A new report from the Family and Parenting Institute underscores this. We worked with research company, Esro, to interview local officers and analyse revenue spending in eight local authorities over two years (2011-12 and 2012-13). The findings reveal how hard officers have tried to mitigate the impact on families and children. But they also point to a squeeze on funding for universal services, as limited resources are increasingly directed towards those deemed to have the highest needs. While there was variation between the councils studied, certain trends emerge. The sharpest reduction in spending has been in services that councils provide to schools (such as school improvement and education welfare). This is partially a reflection of the fact that local authorities now have fewer duties towards schools, with some funding having been \"transferred\" from local authorities to academies. Meanwhile, services for families and young people below the threshold of social work intervention (such as youth centres), as well as early years services (such as children's centres), also shouldered a large share of spending reductions. Councils were increasingly refocusing resources on targeted interventions, limiting the scope for universal provision. There were also deep cuts in councils' back-office and support systems. In contrast, services for children with special educational needs appear relatively protected from budget cuts. Similarly, spending on social work services and services for looked-after children (including child protection and residential care) also seems to have been spared deep cuts, but this masks a more complex story. In fact, savings had been made in this category, but they were eclipsed by necessary growth in budgets as services found themselves faced with rising demand. However, it would be wrong to assume that all of these spending cuts translate directly into reductions in frontline services. Managers were actively seeking cost-efficient ways of sustaining services, despite smaller budgets. In practice, this might mean replacing static youth work with mobile youth provision, for example. As one senior officer put it: \"The cuts gave us an opportunity. We had to radically rethink and reshape the system.\" Despite pockets of encouraging practice, the research warns of costly problems that some cuts could be storing up for the future. \"Lighter touch\" universal services are perhaps an obvious target for short-term savings, but in practice this will only limit ability to intervene earlier, and more cost-effectively, with families. Our research also highlights how difficult it will be for local authorities to find further efficiency savings behind the frontline. As one officer said: \"We designed our new operating model based on a two-year recession, not a five- or seven-year stagnation. Who knows what the future might be like?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
