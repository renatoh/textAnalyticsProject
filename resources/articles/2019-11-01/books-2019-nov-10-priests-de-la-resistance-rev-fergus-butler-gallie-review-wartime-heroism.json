Before the Rev Fergus Butler-Gallie embarks on a whistlestop tour of saints and martyrs who fought the good fight against Hitler and fascism, he recalls the words of St Paul: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female: all are one in Christ.\u201d Take note, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski and Matteo Salvini. What follows is an hugely enjoyable if slightly eccentric account of clerical heroism in the face of evil. One would be tempted to call it a romp, were it not for the depth of moral seriousness that motivated the priests and nuns whose stories are recounted. Butler-Gallie starts off with Canon F\u00e9lix Kir in what is billed as a tale of \u201cwhite wine and espionage\u201d. Kir, a priest and politician in the Burgundian town of Dijon, helped more than 5,000 PoWs to escape during the course of the war through a slave labour scam. He miraculously survived an assassination attempt, went on the run and reappeared atop an American tank as it rolled into his liberated home town. Apparently, this bit of showmanship infuriated General de Gaulle, who thought it stole some of his limelight. As with the other heroes of his book, Butler-Gallie is keen to offset Kir\u2019s moral courage by fondly chronicling his flaws, notably a love of alcohol. \u201cWell into his late 80s,\u201d he writes, \u201cKir would take several hours over lunch, almost always washed down by a blanc-cassis, a whole bottle of red and a slurp of sparkling white to finish, before \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 returning to his desk for an afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d After the war, producers of the national hero\u2019s favourite drink successfully sought permission to name it after him. Butler-Gallie\u2019s humorous, rollicking approach works well with a character such as Canon Kir, but occasionally the jauntiness is a bit wearing. In a chapter on the great theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, hanged in Flossenb\u00fcrg for his part in the plot to kill Hitler, he includes a slightly off-colour joke about the sexual voracity of the Lutheran minister\u2019s father. The chain-smoking Sister S\u00e1ra Salkah\u00e1zi, who died at the hands of Hungarian fascists after hiding Jews and others at risk of deportation to the camps, is described as \u201cthe feisty nicotine nun\u201d. Her life, the author tells us unhelpfully, proves that \u201cunlikely nuns are not just figures of the fervid and lusty male imagination\u201d. This book is Butler-Gallie\u2019s follow-up to the well-received A Field Guide to the English Clergy. Those who read that will recognise the jaunty joviality of this volume dedicated to \u201cloose canons\u201d. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But occasional lapses in tone and a certain Boy\u2019s Own quality to some of the prose (one priest\u2019s resistance tale is described as \u201ca story of daring escapes from stormtroopers, of late-night rendezvous and of cross-dressing clergy\u201d) are forgivable in a book bursting with such generosity of spirit. Butler-Gallie necessarily races through the biographies in what is a slim paperback. But he achieves an inspiring effect through the sheer cumulative impact of so many brave decisions taken when it would have been easier to do otherwise. From the searing indictments of Nazism delivered from the pulpit by Clemens von Galen, the bishop of Munster, in wartime Germany, to the safe networks established by St Maximilian Kolbe, which successfully hid nearly 2,000 Polish Jews, individual acts of courage confounded Hitler\u2019s expectation that he would one day \u201chave the Church on the ropes\u201d. Wisely, Butler-Gallie explicitly excludes the complex and sometimes dark relationship between the institutional churches and fascism from his remit. This is a book about Christian individuals and their Pauline determination to protect fellow human beings from persecution, whatever their faith or race. When, at Pentecost in 1940, Salkah\u00e1zi took lifelong orders with the Sisters of Social Service in Budapest, she adopted as a personal motto a line from the prophecy of Isaiah: \u201cHere I am! Send me.\u201d She and the other remarkable figures in this book were sent in the most difficult and dangerous of circumstances. They did not hesitate to go. \u2022 Priests de la Resistance: The Loose Canons Who Fought Fascism in the Twentieth Century by The Rev Fergus Butler-Gallie is published by Oneworld (\u00a312.99).
