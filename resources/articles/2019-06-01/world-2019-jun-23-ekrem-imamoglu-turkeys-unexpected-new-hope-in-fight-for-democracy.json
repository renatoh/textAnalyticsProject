But by standing his ground in the fierce battle to become mayor of Istanbul, even after Turkey\u2019s electoral board cancelled his victory, he has become President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s most high profile challenger in years and the unexpected new hope for Turkish democracy. The former construction company boss entered local politics in 2009, becoming mayor of Istanbul\u2019s middle-class Beylikd\u00fcz\u00fc district in 2014. Although an outside pick for the opposition coalition People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) mayoral candidate, his low-key campaign strategy in March built on the good faith he had already earned among constituents as a competent and open-minded administrator. In speeches he stressed the importance of working together to tackle urban poverty and condemned the populist rhetoric that has become commonplace in Turkish politics. At the beginning of the year, he met with Erdo\u011fan to discuss Istanbul\u2019s future, a gesture that earned the respect of voters who have often felt alienated by the secular and middle-class CHP. \u0130mamo\u011flu was regularly seen at neighbourhood meetings discussing local issues, whereas the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) candidate, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, was sidelined by the president, who whipped up nationalist fervour at huge rallies. Despite almost blanket pro-government media coverage for Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s March campaign managed to draw votes from the city\u2019s Kurdish minority who were unhappy with the arrests of Kurdish politicians, as well as working-class AKP voters suffering from an inflation rate above 20% and rising unemployment. The shock CHP victory broke Islamist parties\u2019 grip on Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic heart for the first time in 25 years. In the build up to Sunday\u2019s rerun, the AKP has recalibrated its platform, reaching out to Kurdish voters and even rebranding some of \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s policies as its own, such as subsidised public transport for young people. The AKP efforts have come to naught, however: able to play both victor and victim in this weekend\u2019s vote, \u0130mamo\u011flu has cast the new election as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy. Opinion polls showed his lead over Yildirim had widened by 8-9%. \u201cIn the name of Istanbul and in the name of the legitimacy of all future elections in our country, I believe today my people will make the right decision,\u201d he told supporters after he cast his vote on Sunday. \u201c\u0130mamo\u011flu represents everything we have missed for a long time,\u201d said a civil society activist, who asked not to be named. \u201cHe is smart, has a great track record and is hopefully going to be the candidate against Erdo\u011fan in 2023.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
