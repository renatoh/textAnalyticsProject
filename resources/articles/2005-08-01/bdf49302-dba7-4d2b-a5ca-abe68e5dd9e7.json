A report from senior judges in England and Wales told the Home Office to expect a big increase in rapes, domestic violence and serious assaults as a result of the new law allowing 24-hour drinking, which comes into force in November. The paper from the Council of Her Majesty's Circuit Judges said: \"Those who routinely see the consequences of drink-fuelled violence in the offences of rape, grievous bodily harm and worse on a daily basis are in no doubt that an escalation of offences of this nature will inevitably be caused by the relaxation of liquor licensing, which the government has now authorised.\" The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) shared a similar sentiment. \"There is a strong link between the increase in disorder and the explosion of late night premises,\" Acpo said in a report published by the Home Office. Acpo rejected government claims that more flexible opening times would discourage binge drinking, arguing that only a change in British drinking culture would stop young people seeking to drink \"far too much\". \"One only has to look to popular holiday destinations to see the effect of allowing British youth unrestricted access to alcohol,\" said the report. \"The assertion that 11pm closing leads to binge drinking is simply not supported by the evidence. \"Drinkers who want to drink later simply go to premises with a later licence.\" The judges made their comments in response to a government consultation document, Drinking Responsibly. They made it clear in the document that they were angry at not being consulted about the introduction of the new around-the-clock drinking legislation. They said: \"Had we been so consulted, we should have emphasised, from our experience as full-time judges sitting in the crown court, the inevitable explosion in alcohol-fuelled violence which in our view would have been the necessary consequence of this relaxation of the licensing regime.\" In an appendix to the report Judge Charles Harris said: \"The situation is already grave, if not grotesque and to facilitate this by making drinking facilities more widely available is close to lunacy.\" The shadow home secretary, David Davis, called for the reforms to be piloted in a few areas to see how they work. Tony Blair has led his ministerial team in insisting that wider choice for the sensible majority and regulation for those who cannot handle their own freedom is the best way to modernise restrictive laws. The junior culture minister James Purnell echoed that as last Saturday's deadline for seeking a new licence approached. He claimed last week that \"the police do support us\". The criticism of the licensing law represents an attack from two pillars of the criminal justice system. The council represents 636 circuit judges who deal with crown court cases in England and Wales while Acpo represents all 44 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. One aspect of the reform is that local people, not magistrates, will be able to influence a licence and its terms. Most pubs are thought to have met the deadline. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association, which represents 32,000 of Britain's 59,000 pubs, recently moved to curb cut-price \"happy hours\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
