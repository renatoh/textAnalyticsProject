Worcester won the First Division with a 100% record and were due to swap places with Rotherham, whose second campaign in the Premiership ended without a victory, but the threat of legal action by Rotherham prompted ERL to seek further legal opinion. Rotherham were refused permission to see Worcester's audit and the club's owner Mike Yarlett contends that Worcester missed the March 31 deadline for satisfying all the Premiership entry criteria. \"We have challenged ERL to explain how and why it feels it has the right to promote Worcester given the club's non-compliance with the entry criteria by the due date,\" Yarlett said. He maintains that Worcester did not submit a request for planning permission to increase their ground capacity to 8,200 until after March 31. The Worcester owner Cecil Duckworth accused Rotherham - who were denied promotion two years ago for not meeting all the criteria by the March 31 date - of bringing the game into disrepute. While Yarlett said he was unhappy with ERL taking legal advice, feeling the case against Worcester was overwhelming, Duckworth welcomed the move. \"Rotherham are grasping at straws,\" he said. ERL said it would decide the promotion issue within the next 10 days, but whatever it decrees it faces the prospect of legal action with neither Yarlett nor Duckworth prepared to accept rejection, especially as the other would be the beneficiary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
