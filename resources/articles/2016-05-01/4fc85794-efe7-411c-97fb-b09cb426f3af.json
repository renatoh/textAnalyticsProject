The recipes are being \u201carchived or mothballed\u201d, a source said, and will \u201cfall off the face of the internet\u201d after the food site is closed. The broadcaster will archive the recipes on its food site although recipes from television shows will remain online for a 30-day period after transmission and the plans will not affect commercial services such as BBC Good Food. Other text-based online offerings are also expected to be hit. A number of travel articles are also expected to be taken offline. Although the recipes will still exist online they will be hard to find. One BBC source said: \u201cThe website will be closed and viewers will have to make a concerted effort to access the archive.\u201d In an announcement due to be made to staff on Tuesday, the BBC will promise a more \u201cfocused and distinctive service\u201d with a number of well-known services either closed or scaled down over the next 12 months. Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes after a bruising battle with the government over the BBC\u2019s market impact, which resulted in last week\u2019s white paper. Although it was widely considered to be better than expected for the BBC, the corporation is responding to comments made by George Osborne, the chancellor, last summer in which he said the BBC was being \u201cimperial in its ambitions\u201d by expanding into content such as recipes. A BBC insider said the changes were an attempt to focus on distinctive content online, an adjective to be added to the corporation\u2019s mission statement. \u201cWhile our audiences expect us to be online, we have never sought to be all things to all people and the changes being announced will ensure that we are not,\u201d he said. \u201cThese changes won\u2019t be popular with all members of the public, but we think they are the right thing to do.\u201d Rumoured plans of cuts to the recipe site have already prompted chef Jack Monroe to promise to post recipes online as a public benefit. In a Facebook post last week, Monroe wrote: \u201cI learned to cook on the dole using free recipes online and for the BBC to reduce this vital service is an abomination.\u201d A separate review of the BBC news channels is expected to outline several options, including a possible merger. At a meeting later on Tuesday for all staff James Harding, the director of BBC news and current affairs, is expected to say that no decision on the three channels \u2013 BBC News, Parliament and World - will be taken until the summer. One option could be merging the 24-hour news service with the BBC World service, for example. The online creative review, which was launched last autumn by Harding, is expected to outline six key areas of \u201cdistinctive public service content\u201d online. These, broadly, are impartial and accurate news, live sport coverage and sport news, the \u201cbest of arts and culture, history and science\u201d pulled together in a new \u201cideas service\u201d, educational services such as BBC Bitesize, entertainment offered through BBC iPlayer, and national events such as royal weddings. Given the focus on online news, the announcement is not expected to cover the future of the BBC News channel or the closure of any particular show. However, director general, Tony Hall, a former news executive, believed that news should be at the heart of the BBC\u2019s offering and will fight against plans to curtail it significantly. Tuesday\u2019s announcement will confirm plans outlined in the white paper to overhaul the BBC\u2019s local news pages so that stories provided by other news organisations can be linked to, for example. Earlier this year, BBC news announced that it was looking to make \u00a380m in savings over the next four years as the corporation tries to save \u00a3550m a year by 2021-22. The \u00a315m saved from the online creative review is in addition to the annual savings. In an interview last July before the funding settlement with the BBC, Osborne indicated that the licence-fee-funded BBC should not be allowed to crowd out newspaper competition. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a website that\u2019s got features and cooking recipes \u2013 effectively the BBC website becomes the national newspaper as well as the national broadcaster. There are those sorts of issues we need to look at very carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want the BBC to completely crowd out national newspapers. If you look at the BBC website it is a good product but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions.\u201d The BBC has fought back by pointing out that online competition is now global; it accounts for about 4.5% of UK adults\u2019 time online compared with Facebook\u2019s 20%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
