If only exercise could be taken vicariously, weight loss while watching sport would break all records. As it is, only the imagination gets a meaningful workout as we prepare to be thrown headlong into a snow-and-ice-filled season of obscure and utterly baffling winter sport. I have often wondered what this country would be like if we got gripped by winter sports the way we do by football and cricket. For kids in the park pretending to pass and dribble like Frank or Wayne, spinning balls like Shane or hitting sixes like Freddie and Kevin (ah, feel the nostalgic wave wash over) substitute a far more random, and frankly, hazardous form of imitation. Just think how much fun life would be if we fully adopted the spirit of curling, speed skating, bob skeleton and biathlon. Brushing the kitchen floor shouting 'Hurry, hurry, hurry', sliding towards the bus stop with long, smooth leg movements, one hand behind the back while the other swings diagonally across the body, tackling the stairs headfirst and face down on a tea tray and skiing to work with a rifle over the shoulder. On the other hand, perhaps that last one should not be encouraged among urban youth. There is an 'otherness' about winter sports that I find appealing. I love the elegance of figure skating, the brutality of ice hockey, the insanity of the luge combined with the bloody-mindedness of downhill skiing. Cowbells ring, steam rises from hot alcoholic drinks, Finland makes a mark on the world stage. It is unfamiliar, un-British and unerringly magnificent. It is also impossible to take too seriously because as a nation, if we do, it can only lead to disappointment. We may be the Pennines to everyone else's Alps, Pyrenees and Rockies, but don't forget we have an outstanding history on the ice: Torvill and Dean, Robin Cousins, John Curry. We used to rule the ice. In two months' time, when the Winter Olympics in Turin launches itself from the top of a steep slope, flying through the air, legs in a perfect V, Britain will be there. Oh yes, our team may be small, but it will not be overawed. It has taken nearly two decades to erase the image of Eddie the Eagle dropping like a boulder from the sky and it is a finer, fitter and, frankly, more proficient team that will arrive in Turin. A gold medal in curling in Salt Lake City, along with a bronze in bob skeleton and a short-lived bronze for Alain Baxter in the slalom represented the best performance for a British team since 1936. This time round, figure skating was the first sport to declare its hand, naming the sibling pair of Sinead and John Kerr. The curling team will be announced before Christmas, Baxter is back and Vick-free in skiing, while we have new faces and strong ambitions in bob skeleton and bobsleigh. The main names to watch out for are: Kristan Bromley, who won last year's bob skeleton World Cup series, and the bobsleigh pair of Nicola Minichiello and Jacky Davies, who were the first British women ever to win a world championship medal when they took silver in Canada earlier this year. Bromley has been impressive in training on the track in Sestriere and admits the course suits him, while Minichiello and Davies had their session held up when a German coach was hit by the Australian bobsleigh. It's a tough sport. The Olympic flame arrived in Rome last week and will travel to 140 cities in the next eight weeks, most of them in Italy but some in the neighbouring countries of Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland and France. As you can pick up a return flight from any of the small airports for less than the cost of a first-class stamp, it is not difficult to pay a quick visit to the home of Juventus, Fiat and the Turin Shroud. Turin has a reputation, largely due to the enormous Fiat factory (now a shopping mall and museum) of being an industrial city. In fact, it has transformed itself into Italy's capital of modern architecture and contemporary culture. It is less touristy than Rome or Florence, more beautiful than Milan and friendlier than Naples. At the heart of the Piedmont region, it lies, as the literal translation reveals, at the foot of the mountains and on the banks of Italy's longest river, the Po. I guess it's hard for any city to look rough when there are snow-capped peaks as a breathtaking backdrop, but I was genuinely taken with the place. As for the Torinese, they have comfortably recovered from Michael Caine bringing the place to a standstill with a few Mini Coopers in The Italian Job. Some of them are none too chuffed with the invasion that will accompany the Winter Games and there is the odd bit of graffiti to demonstrate that feeling - it's amazing how well swear words translate - but the majority of them are too cool to be bothered. The slogan for the Games is 'Passion lives here' and, as the Olympic torch started its journey, the head honcho of the organising committee said it was 'very emotional'. Those in Turin are evidently ensuring that they don't peak too soon. A chic lady with a dead animal around her neck and scary glasses told me that Torinese never get too excited about anything in advance, but when the Games start they will give it their full support. I hope they do because those piazzas can be cold and lonely places. I had a long conversation with a mature student whose family lived in Rome. He tried to explain that people in the north of Italy are much harder-working and more conscientious than those in the south (you see, the rest of Europe really isn't that different) and that Romans are basically lazy bastards who go to the beach every day. Some of it may have been lost in translation but I got the gist. He also told me that he had spent \u20ac250 on a slither of white truffle, the local delicacy, to shave on a couple of plates of pasta. Why anyone would want to spend money on a subterranean fungus that tastes like tree bark, I have never understood, but that's Italy for you - hugely alluring and attractive but ultimately beyond our comprehension. A bit like winter sports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
