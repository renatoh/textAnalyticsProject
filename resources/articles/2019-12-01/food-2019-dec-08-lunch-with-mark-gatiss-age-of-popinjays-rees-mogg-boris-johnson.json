He seems to have so much on. The co-creator and writer of Sherlock (he also played a beady-eyed Mycroft) has not long finished production on a new incarnation of Dracula, a revamp which will be a headline act of BBC schedules next year. That morning he\u2019s been making the finishing edits to voiceovers for a Bram Stoker documentary that will go out alongside the drama series. He has also devised and directed a Christmas ghost story \u2013 an adaptation of MR James\u2019s tale, Martin\u2019s Close, which pitches Peter Capaldi into the 17th-century courtroom of \u201cHanging Judge\u201d Jeffreys. Add in last year\u2019s sell-out tour of the regathered League of Gentlemen, and his long stint as writer on the revived Doctor Who, and you have a sense of Gatiss, at 53, as a sort of one-man Gothic cottage industry, marshalling a production line of brilliantly knowing grotesques, injecting fresh blood into fireside stories. I wait for him with a beer in the Duke of Cambridge, the organic foodie pub that is his local in Islington (it comes as no surprise to discover that his house around the corner features a Victorian laboratory with cabinets of curiosities). It\u2019s a windy old November afternoon starting to lose its light. I half expect Gatiss to swing through the saloon doors in a cape and a gust of autumn leaves. When he arrives, tall and carefully elegant and grinning and apologising, the best he can offer by way of horrors are ghoulish scrolled photos of himself tricked up as Jacob Rees-Mogg for a Halloween party. \u201cI had some \u2018dead pallor\u2019 makeup which was perfect,\u201d he says, of his pinstriped Mr Hyde. \u201cThe only problem was several people wanted to punch me.\u201d He\u2019s a regular enough visitor here, often with his husband, the actor Ian Hallard, to know what he wants; in case the kitchen closes he\u2019s ordered ahead for a bowl of cannellini bean stew that comes with a hunk of bread and harissa and a rich broth. Sitting down, he notes how the pub is only a few doors down the road from the house in which Joe Orton lived and died. Gatiss is, by coincidence, off up to Leicester later in the week for an auction to raise money for an Orton statue in the writer\u2019s home city. He has his eye on a couple of facsimiles of those infamous defaced Islington library books from Orton\u2019s indecency trial. \u201cSome of the best filthy comic writing in history,\u201d he says, with his joyful hoot of a laugh. Gatiss seems to have been born for his current vocation. He grew up in Sedgefield, County Durham, in a house opposite an Edwardian asylum, the son of a mining engineer. He was raised on a diet of Alan Bennett and Ripping Yarns and is exhibit A in the power of books to shape a child\u2019s imagination (he loves that Bennett idea of an author\u2019s welcoming hand reaching out from a book and taking yours). Aged five or six and already beginning to be immersed in the Doctor Who stories and Willard Price\u2019s adventure series, he was chosen for special lessons as an advanced reader with Mrs Wiggington at Heighington C of E school. He recalls being awarded a house point for knowing the word \u201csubterranean\u201d. Someone gave him a copy of Great Expectations one Christmas soon after and he was away. \u201cI owe that book an awful lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the plot twist about Magwitch came, I remember my jaw literally dropping open. I still absolutely love it, it\u2019s so full of terror and humanity.\u201d That latter double act, in different comic guises, has been the staple of Gatiss\u2019s writing since he first met Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton at drama school in Yorkshire and they formed The League of Gentlemen. They were on the road with a stage show for a few years before being offered a radio slot and then a TV series by the BBC in 1999. Even then, his family weren\u2019t convinced it was a proper career. \u201cI remember my parents coming down to stay in London in about 2000,\u201d he says. \u201cRonnie Corbett strangely was a very early fan of The League of Gentlemen \u2013 he came to our show in Edinburgh. I mentioned that to my mum and she said: \u2018Well, surely he can do something to help you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mum, it\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve got our own TV show now.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe was always on at me to learn golf, because that is how Kenneth More got his big break.\u201d Gatiss\u2019s lack of a handicap hasn\u2019t proved an obstacle. It seems, 20 years on, that he has arrived at that rare place where he \u2013 and Sherlock co-creator Steven Moffat \u2013 can pretty much make what they want. How, I wonder, did Dracula happen? \u201cIt came about oddly. We had just started the third series of Sherlock and I had a photograph on my phone of Benedict [Cumberbatch] silhouetted against a door, with his collar up. I showed the picture to Ben Stephenson, then head of drama at the BBC, at an awards dinner and said, \u2018He looks like Dracula, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 And Ben said: \u2018Do you want to do it?\u2019 That didn\u2019t mean we were commissioned \u2013 that is just where it began.\u201d It feels, I say, like a good year to be creating horror shows. Does he think the dramas we\u2019re drawn to reflect the anxieties we absorb from the news, or act as an escape from them? \u201cI think both,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1930s, people wanted to see Busby Berkeley musicals, but there was also a big horror boom. It\u2019s one way to contain our fears. I think we are drawn to things like Succession because we need to see the rich and powerful having troubles. But equally we want to watch Spider-Man because we want to believe that there are forces out there that can sort things out for us. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that these things are co-existing.\u201d Having created a microcosm of little England monsters in the League of Gentlemen\u2019s fictional Royston Vasey \u2013 \u201ca local town for local people\u201d \u2013 Gatiss now encounters them on the Parliament channel. \u201cWe live in an age of popinjays, and so many of them are really weird constructs,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople like Mark Francois, Rees-Mogg, Johnson, the common factor is how much performance is involved. And tragically we still fall for it.\u201d When we speak, we are at the outset of the election campaign. Gatiss, who must be a natural optimist to get so much done, is beset by a sense of impending doom. \u201cNobody knows anything, except, deep down, that we are fucked and we have to live through it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe probably have to leave, just to earth the storm. At least then we can say: OK, we\u2019ve done it. Now what?\u201d The immediate answer to that apocalyptic question appears to be \u201capple crumble\u201d. It is a day for comfort food. \u201cEvery day is one of those now,\u201d Gatiss says. He confesses to switching to Classic FM in the mornings in search of respite from Today only to hear an Orwellian subtext: \u201cThey were playing trailers saying \u2018Breakfast without the B word\u2019. The theme is like \u2018relax until you open a vein\u2019.\u201d I wonder if he has been tempted to up sticks and work in the US. There must have been offers, post-Sherlock? \u201cYou would be surprised how little interest there is,\u201d he says. \u201cEighteen months ago I got an email from a major studio asking if I would be interested in talking about writing a horror property they had \u2013 I won\u2019t say what. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do it, but I made the mistake of replying politely, you know, \u2018If I could have told my eight-year-old self I\u2019d be offered this\u2026\u2019 I had 40 emails by return, insisting I speak to this person and that person at this Pacific Standard Time. It\u2019s a totally different way of working. It astonishes me that anything good comes out of America when their whole system seems to be based on firing people. I have no wish to be fired.\u201d He checks his watch, drains his coffee, makes his excuses. Horror stories are beckoning. \u201cI think in general people find it very hard to realise that the thing they are living through might be the good thing,\u201d he says, of ambition, and calms before storms. \u201cAnd then they discover it\u2019s too late.\u201d Martin\u2019s Close is on Christmas Eve on BBC Four, Dracula begins on New Year\u2019s Day on BBC One, and In Search of Dracula will air on BBC Two in January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
