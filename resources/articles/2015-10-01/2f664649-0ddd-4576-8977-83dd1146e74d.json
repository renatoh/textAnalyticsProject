Bond fans will of course recognise it as the theme tune from The Spy Who Loved Me, which is about the disappearance of two nuclear missile submarines. The programme finishes with pipe music from 4th battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Army School of Bagpipe Music. We\u2019re going to wrap up this blog now, but will leave you with this representation of the Xi visit, courtesy of Steve Bell: Steve Hilton, David Cameron\u2019s sneaker-clad former chief strategist, has been telling the BBC that the UK shouldn\u2019t be \u201csucking up to China\u201d- rather it should be pushing for sanctions against Beijing. He told BBC\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cI think this is one of the worst national humiliations since we went cap in hand to the IMF\u2019s in the seventies\u201d. It\u2019s a point which Hilton has pressed home in Guardian (you can read him in full here). As well as China\u2019s human rights record at home, Hilton cites China\u2019s \u201crelentless cyber attacks,\u201d adding: \u201cThe truth is that China is a rogue state, just like Iran, and I don\u2019t understand why we are sucking up to them.\u201d \u201cWhy are we not rolling out the carpet to a country like India?\u201d Martin Sorrell, Chief Executive at WPP, is also a guest on the programme and disagrees: \u201cTo suggest that we are not going to roll out the red carpet for Prime Minister Modi [of India] is false. The answer is to do both.\u201d \u201cYou ignore China at your peril. Our experience has been that the Chinese do listen and learn and we underestimate their capacity to listen and learn.\u201d The Guardian puts an image of Xi meeting the Queen on the front page, above a report on how David Cameron has been urged to challenge the Chinese president over job losses in the British steel industry following the announcement of 1,200 redundancies by the UK\u2019s largest steelmaker Xi\u2019s visit is getting front page treatment in Wednesday\u2019s British newspapers, with the Financial Times leading on a report that the UK is hoping to unlock \u00a330bn worth of Chinese investment, although there are questions over issues such as the absence of discussion about human rights in China. The Guardian\u2019s John Crace has filed a sketch on the rather \u201cloveless marriage\u201d earlier today as the prime minister played chief usher to Xi during the Chinese president\u2019s Westminster address. Here\u2019s a snatch from the piece, which you can read in full here: Xi Jinping had arrived mob-handed with coach loads of advisers and security detail and, after a brief panic when it was realised there weren\u2019t nearly enough seats for them all, the Chinese president walked in escorted on one side by the speaker of the Commons and on the other by Baroness D\u2019Souza, the speaker of the Lords. It\u2019s possible that [the Speaker] John Bercow had read somewhere that the Chinese don\u2019t respect people who brown nose too obviously, but he was certainly keen to carry on where he had left off in the Commons. \u201cYour visit is the latest in a recent line of Asian leaders that began with Aung San Suu Kyi, that champion of human rights in Burma,\u201d he said. A look of panic crossed Dave\u2019s face as he imagined billions of pounds worth of trade deals being cancelled by the end of the day, but President Xi didn\u2019t let slip a flicker. Among those not present at the banquet is Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minisister of Scotland. There\u2019s a story in The National reporting that she had been invited to the banquet but has declined due to \u201cexisting commitments\u201d. A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: Scotland values its strong relationship with China \u2013 the First Minister had a successful visit to China in July and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop recently attended the UK China High Level People to People Dialogue in September where the Chinese side was led by Vice-Premier Madam Liu Yandong. She\u2019s missing out on the pudding which guests are likely to be reaching by now (I can inform you that it\u2019s a delice of dark chocolate mango and lime, not a patch on the ham and cheese sandwich which I\u2019m about to grab). Human rights, Tibet or any of those other hot button issues (unsurprisingly) didn\u2019t get a look-in earlier when the Queen and President Xi were addressing the banquet. But they\u2019re very much on the minds of demonstrators outside Buckingham Palace. Some footage: There\u2019s a lot of comment on social media about the appearance of Jeremy Corbyn in white tie for the meal, confounding speculation that the confirmed republican might ignore the recommended dress code. The Labour leader, who attended the banquet alone, is sitting at the same table as Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It had been suggested that he could seek to use the formal function to raise contentious issues with Xi Jinping if no private meeting could be arranged. The pair did meet before the banquet in the 1844 Room, where they shook hands cordially, with Mr Corbyn placing his other hand on top and telling Mr Xi: \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you. I look forward to our meeting.\u201d We\u2019ve got a report on their exchanges here. Meanwhile, on the matter of that white tie: Away from the banquet, Cameron has been urged to challenge the Chinese president over job losses in the British steel industry following the announcement of 1,200 redundancies by the UK\u2019s largest steelmaker. We have a report here on announcement by Tata Steel, which said 900 jobs would be lost at Scunthorpe and 270 at two sites in Scotland as it blamed cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs for its decision to stop production of steel plate. The announcement came one day after 1,700 jobs were put at risk when steel products firm Caparo Industries entered administration, in the same month that 2,200 jobs were lost when the owner of the Redcar plant on Teeside went into liquidation. Workers at the Dalzell site in Motherwell, one of the affected Tata mills, said managers had referred to competition from cheap Chinese steel when they briefed staff on Tuesday. \u201cThey as good as said it was the end of the steel industry in Scotland this morning. The way they spoke about the Chinese imports, that\u2019s how it was explained to us,\u201d said Andrew Crawford, who has worked at Dalzell for nearly three decades. Is this strictly in line with protocol? Chris Ship of ITV has picked up on the intriguing method used by the Prime Minister to greet his foreign minister, Hugo Swire, at the banquet earlier: Back inside the banquet, Xi and the guests are being treated to a somewhat eclectic music programme, courtesy of the Countess of Wessex\u2019s String Orchestra. Here\u2019s what they sound like at other times: The music programme ranges from Robert Farnon\u2019s The Westminster Waltz, through to Irish and Chinese folk songs and the Beatles\u2019 Eleanor Rigby. The focus of much of those protests, China\u2019s human rights record, was raised earlier this evening by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, when he met with Xi. The Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason has filed a piece on the meeting, which Labour described as \u201ccordial and constructive\u201d. A statement from Labour following Corbyn\u2019s meeting stressed the good nature of the exchange, and praised \u201cthe remarkable Chinese achievements in poverty-reduction, lifting over 600 million people out of poverty\u201d. Discussion between Corbyn and Xi also ranged over historic links between the UK, Labour and China, the sacrifice of the Chinese people in the struggle against fascism during the second world war, and Xi\u2019s New Silk Road strategy. They then spoke about working together to address major threats to world security such as climate change, persistent economic inequality and international terrorism, as well as opportunities to upgrade cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and the UK. The protests are meanwhile continuing outside. Matteo Mecacci, President of the International Campaign for Tibet, tweets: Enda Brady of Sky News is also there: So what to make of those carefully scripted words? Some early reaction from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, who noted that Xi held up George Hogg as a British hero who helped China under Japanese occupation. Speeches out of the way, they can now start tucking in to that Balmoral Venison, and more: Xi finishes with a toast: To the prosperity of the UK and the happiness of its people. To the everlasting thendship between China and the UK and their peopless To the health of Your Majesty the Queen and Your Royal Highness Prince Philip, to the health of the members of the Royal Family and to the health of all the friends present. Delving back into history, he adds: The founding of New China in 1949 opened a new chapter in China-UK relationship. Britain was the first major Western country to recognize the People\u2019s Republic of China. In October 1986, Your Majesty and Your Royal Highness paid a successful state visit to China, marking a highlight in China-UK relationship. In 1997, our two countries resolved the question of Hong Kong\u2019s return to China in a creative way, turning a new page in bilateral relations. Xi is on his feet now and is recalling the Second World War, telling those at the banquet that China will never forget the support it received from the UK at that time. He says: As a Chinese saying goes, \u201cNothing, not even mountains and oceans, can separate people with shared goals and vision.\u201d This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People\u2019s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. As allies during the Second World War, China and Britain fought side by side to uphold justice, and made significant contribution to the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the establishment of the post-war international order anchored on the United Nations. She ends by saying that \u201cthis global partnership is supported by an expanding network of links between the people Britain and China. Mr. President, your visit is a defining moment in this very special year for our bilateral relationship. I am confident that it will serve to highlight the sincerity and warmth of our friendship and to strengthen relations between our countries for many years to come. She goes on to mention that this year marks the seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, adding: Today the world faces challenges which call for collaboration between the nations: conflict and terrorism; poverty and ill-health; conservation and climate change. As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Britain and China are stewards of the rules-based international system, and we have a responsibility to cooperate on these issues which have a direct bearing on the security and prosperity of all our peoples. Praising China\u2019s economic growth, she talks of how millions have been lifted out of poverty, telling the banquet: Almost thirty years later, Mr Deng\u2019s vision has borne remarkable fruit. Rapid economic growth and development has transformed the lives of people across China and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty: a huge and historic achievement with far reaching positive effects on people\u2019s lives. The Queen is now speaking, and starts by recalling the visit she and her husband made to China thirty years ago. It was China\u2019s desire to shape a new future which captivated them the most, she says, as Xi listens beside her. We were struck by the energy and enthusiasm with which China\u2019s leaders were forging ahead with a new and ambitious future for the Chinese people; and I well recall our discussions with the late paramount leader Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was foremost among these leaders in setting a clear direction for China with his policy of reform. It was also Mr. Deng\u2019s visionary concept of One Country Two Systems which opened the way for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. To the strains of God Save the Queen, Xi Jinping and the Queen are now taking their seats. In the meantime, we can now reveal details of they and other guests including David Cameron will be dining on. Venison from the Queen\u2019s estate at Balmoral is the main course on a menu that\u2019s rather different from some of the fare which Xi is fond of using to burnish his \u2018man of the people\u2019 credentials back in Beijing. More here. On the side is braised red cabbage, cocotte potatoes and timbale of celeriac and butternut squash. Pudding comes in the form of delice of dark chocolate, mango and lime according to details of the menu, which has been released by the palace. The wine list features French and South African choices, as well as 1977 Warre\u2019s Vintage Port. However, nurturers of Britain\u2019s nascent wine industry with an eye on an emerging market, where appreciation of wine is a status symbol, might hope that senior communist party palettes will be tickled by the Ridgeview Grosvenor 2009, a sparking English wine originating in West Sussex. And some early breaking news. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, IS wearing white tie after all. Cosmetic stuff of course in the general rough and tumble of political debate, but as stark an image as you might find to indicate just how far the former backbencher has travelled. Good evening and welcome to continued coverage on our liveblog of the first state visit to the UK in ten years by a Chinese premier, Xi Jinping. Photographs are coming through of guests arriving for tonight\u2019s state banquet at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen, are coming through, starting with Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge. The Chinese president Xi Jinping has addressed British parliamentarians at the Palace of Westminster, in a speech focussed on historic binational ties, law and order, and China\u2019s burgeoning economy. Introducing the president, speaker John Bercow said he hoped both countries would \u201caspire to be seen not merely as a powerful force in the world but a moral inspiration to it.\u201d Earlier in the day, Xi and his wife spent the morning at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where he met the Prince of Wales on his first full day of engagements on his four-day state visit to Britain. The Chinese couple then travelled to Horse Guards Parade for a guard of honour, and were escorted to Buckingham Palace by carriage, as hundreds of pro-China protesters lined the Mall, drowning out Free Tibet and human rights activists. Xi had lunch with the Queen, viewed the Royal Collection\u2019s Chinese artefacts, and exchanged gifts with the Royals, giving them two album\u2019s of his pop star wife Peng Liyuan\u2019s music. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said Britain has its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d about China in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, though ministers expect more than 30 billion of trade and investment deals to be struck during the visit. Casting a long shadow over proceedings, Tata Steel has confirmed that nearly 1,200 jobs will go in Scunthorpe and Scotland, blaming China in part for the collapse of the industry. Cameron has promised to raise the steel crisis with President Xi but his spokesman would not confirm how forcefully the point about cheap Chinese imports would be made. President Xi will take tea with Prince Charles at Clarence House, before travelling back to Buckingham Palace for a state banquet, where he will be greeted by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has promised to raise human rights issues with the Chinese leader. Prince Charles and Camilla will not attend the banquet, hosted by the Queen, but Prince William will be present, and it will be the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s first state banquet since their marriage. Cameron did not wear his translation headphones for the speech by President Xi - which was entirely in Mandarin. Has the prime minister been secretly swotting up on his Chinese? My colleague Elena Cresci believes she can spy a fancy one-eared listening device in the prime minister\u2019s ear, on the side away from the camera. Perhaps the most controversial sentence of Xi\u2019s speech? Parliamentarians are the cream of a society. He says he hopes British lawmakers \u201cscale higher to see further\u201d and praises the work of the All Party Parliamentary Group on China. \u201cWe welcome you to visit China more often, to learn more about my country and experience it\u2019s changes.\u201d He quotes Francis Bacon \u201cwise men make more opportunities than the find\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s first code of statutes was compiled more than 2,000 years ago,\u201d Xi continues in a section of the speech focussed on law and order. \u201cToday as the Chinese people are advancing the rule of law in an all round way, they draw inspiration not only from China\u2019s own legal traditions, but also the best practices of other countries. \u201cOur goal is to ensure all are equal before the law,\u201d he says, adding that the socialist system must have \u201cdistinctive Chinese features\u201d. The priority is strict law, traditional justice and the building of a \u201claw-abiding nation\u201d, he says. Xi is talking about the historic relationship between the UK and \u201cnew China\u201d. He says that although China and the UK are located at opposite ends of the Eurasian continent, \u201cwe have a deep mutual affection.\u201d As expected, the focus is on economic ties. He names the UK as the largest offshore RMB trading centre, and says it hosts more Chinese students than any other EU country, as well as being the first western country to issue RMB sovereign bonds. China and the UK are \u201cincreasingly inter-dependent and becoming a community of shared interests,\u201d he says. Xi Jinping is speaking now, he says entering the Palace of Westminster is like \u201cgoing back in time.\u201d Speaker John Bercow is introducing Xi Jinping. He says: \u201cYour visit here today reinforces the links between the United Kingdom and China, social and personal, as well as economic and political, and all the stronger for it.\u201d The Chinese people have \u201cmany, many friends in this parliament,\u201d Bercow says, adding that China has \u201cengaged in an experience and experiment without equal in history, attempting to complete an industrial revolution which took Britain two centuries in little more than two decades.\u201d \u201cThe enormous challenge how to deal with this falls to you and your colleagues,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhat China does economically and political is relevant not merely to your own 1.5bn citzens, it is relevant to billions more across the globe.\u201d \u201cThe world will be watching and waiting expectantly as the emerging superpower that is China takes its new place in the world. \u201cWe should all aspire to be seen not merely as a powerful force in the world but a moral inspiration to it.\u201d My colleague Ben Quinn just took this Vine of Cameron and Corbyn deep in conversation. Corbyn appears to be giving an almost imperceptible nod. What are they talking about? Peers and MPs are inside the Great Hall, waiting for the address. Jeremy Corbyn and David Cameron are sitting next to each other. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor looks ahead to Xi\u2019s imminent speech in Westminster. MPs and Lords are gathering in the Palace of Westminster to hear Xi Jinping speak in the next half hour. Normally on these occasions, visiting dignatories start by paying homage to the \u2018mother of parliament\u2019 and wax on about shared democratic lineage. Xi will no doubt give that a miss, but can fall back on a favourite of UK-China speeches noting that these are two very old countries - though China of course is much, much older. Here are some other points to look for in the speech: It is possible he will use the opportunity to make an announcement of a trade or investment deal, perhaps even the much-awaited nuclear deal, though on balance such an announcement is more likely to come when Xi meets David Cameron at Downing Street tomorrow. A virtual certainty is an emphasis on the economic opportunities offered by bilateral trade and investment. This is the main point of the visit, and something on which both governments emphatically agree. What will be particularly interesting to look for are any reflections on the wider world, and China\u2019s place in it, especially in relation to any of the current global crises. Xi\u2019s leadership has been all about flexing Chinese muscle around the world, and he will be watched carefully for assertive rhetoric in Westminster today. In her 63 years on the throne, the Queen is unlikely to have ever been presented with a gift quite like the one Xi Jinping brought to Buckingham Palace. The Chinese president has given the monarch two albums of Chinese folk music - recorded by his wife Madame Peng, who was formerly a famous pop star. Here\u2019s some samples her hits: Her albums include My Fellow Countrymen, China Golden Voice and Smooth Sailing, as well as a Greatest Hits release, but it is not known which one has been gifted for the Buckingham Palace household iPod. Xi also presented the Queen with a 1.18 metre long work of embroidery, a large porcelain dish, a woodcarving and a stamp booklet. The Queen\u2019s first gift was not exactly imaginative, she gave them a pair of silver framed photographs of herself and Duke of Edinburgh, the same gift she gives every world leader. She also presented Peng with a pair of Royal Crown Derby candlesticks, and Xi with a collection of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, in a specially commissioned leather and gilt box, made by the Windsor Castle bindery. That may be a more thoughtful gift than it would appear at first glance - Xi is renowned as a lover of literature in his home country, peppering his speeches with classical Chinese poetic references, according to this article in the WSJ. There\u2019s no reporters on site, so we\u2019re relying on tweets from inside the Palace to give us an indication of Xi\u2019s movements. He\u2019s currently viewing exhibition in the picture gallery at Buckingham Palace of \u201citems from the Royal Collection relating to China\u201d, along with the Chinese ambassador. Xi will shortly be heading to address Parliament. This is the lunch Xi Jinping is being served at Buckingham Palace, according to the official British monarchy Twitter account. It appears to be a half an egg, some lettuce and a bit of p\u00e2t\u00e9 - hope he\u2019s not too hungry. We\u2019ve just seen pictures from Prince Charles\u2019 meeting with Xi Jinping at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. No reporters were present at the meeting, which included Peng Liyuan and the Duchess of Cornwall. The only refreshments that appeared to be on offer at the meeting, judging by the pictures, were glasses of water - though Xi does have a day of extravagant eating ahead of him. The meeting took place in private - most likely because of the uneasy relationship the Chinese government has with the heir to the throne, who is a supporter of the Dalai Lama and once described the country\u2019s politicians as \u201cappalling old waxworks\u201d after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Buckingham Palace has insisted Charles is not snubbing the president when he misses the state banquet this evening - he is said to just be in need of a rest. Charles and Camilla also joined the Queen\u2019s lunch at Buckingham Palace and attended the ceremony at Horse Guard\u2019s Parade. But his non-attendance may bring back uncomfortable memories of the row caused in 1999 when Charles also refused to attend the banquet for then-president Jiang Zemin. Charles\u2019s former aide Mark Bolland alleged that snub had been deliberate. \u201cHe did not approve of the Chinese regime, and is a great supporter of the Dalai Lama, whom he views as being oppressed by the Chinese,\u201d he wrote in his book. But Charles chose not to see the Dalai Lama during his visit to the UK last month, perhaps mindful of the row that ensued when David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in 2012, and China cancelled diplomatic meetings. Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived at Buckingham Palace for lunch with the Queen, on his first full day of engagements on his four-day state visit to Britain. Xi spent the morning at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where he met the Prince of Wales, who will not be attending tonight\u2019s state banquet. Hundreds of pro-China protests lined the Mall with red flags, banners and posters, creating a carnival atmosphere with dragon performers and drumming to welcome Xi to Britain - and to drown out human rights protesters. Free Tibet activists, along with members of Amnesty International, were swamped by the sheer number of co-ordinated pro-Chinese demonstrators. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said Britain has its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d about China in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, though ministers expect more than 30 billion of trade and investment deals to be struck during the four-day visit. Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were welcomed to Horse Guards parade by a 41-gun salute, a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, and greeted dignataries including David Cameron and Theresa May. Tata Steel has confirmed that nearly 1,200 jobs will go in Scunthorpe and Scotland, blaming China in part for the collapse of the industry in a statement which rained on the parade today. Cameron\u2019s spokesman has said the PM will not reveal how strongly he is prepared to object to China\u2019s steel-dumping in his meetings with Xi but said the matter would be raised. Xi is set to visit the Houses of Parliament this afternoon, before a state banquet at Buckingham Palace this evening, where the Chinese couple will spend the night. In the House of Commons just now, Speaker John Bercow appears to have made a sly dig at the Chinese president during a question which compared the UK\u2019s relationship with China and India. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK next month Labour MP Keith Vaz said: \u201cCan I join you in welcoming the visit of Narendra Modi, which has caused huge excitement among the British Indian community in places like London and indeed in Leicester? And will this enable the Government to send out a message that it\u2019s not just learning Chinese that is important, that a bit of Hindi would go down well in our bilateral relations?\u201d Responding, Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire replied: \u201cI very much hope you are now not going to test me on my Hindi\u201d adding that the country was looking forward to welcoming Modi. But then in an intervention, and to loud intakes of breath in the chamber, Bercow said: And of course the Indian prime minister is the representative of a great democracy. Xi is due to meet Bercow when he addresses the Commons later this afternoon. Here\u2019s some drama from the ceremony which the TV cameras didn\u2019t pick up, one of the guard of honour from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards appears to have passed out just before Xi\u2019s arrival, and fallen head first onto the red gravel. He was quickly picked up by a colleague and escorted away from the scene, PA reports. If you\u2019re keeping up with the identical Chinese flags and t-shirts plot (which isn\u2019t really a plot because everyone knows what\u2019s going on anyway) - Peter Walker has some developments. Our Beijing correspondent brings us some reaction from China on the pomp and ceremony of Xi\u2019s welcome. As you might expect, there\u2019s been no mention of the protests along the Mall on Chinese government-run media. Rather, we\u2019ve had lots and lots of talk about the pomp and circumstance being afforded to China\u2019s leader. \u201cAs Xi Jinping alights from his car, royal salutes will be fired across London,\u201d gushed the CCTV presenter hosting a live broadcast of today\u2019s ceremony. \u201cYou can hear as he nears Buckingham the roar going up,\u201d enthused the channel\u2019s correspondent on the ground. \u201cExcited Chinese nationals perhaps seeing their president for the first time. Certainly seeing the Queen for the first time.\u201d Wang Yiwei, a Chinese academic who is anchoring a television broadcast of the first day\u2019s action, tells viewers Xi\u2019s trip is about mixing the best of both nations. \u201cThe UK is the number one soft power country in the world,\u201d he says. \u201c [This is] soft power and hard power cooperation.\u201d The Birmingham Mail reports today that George Osborne personally intervened to Xi Jinping to visit Manchester, not the Midlands, during his four-day tour. According to the paper, several key figures had lobbied for the Chinese president to visit Birmingham, including John Lewis chairman Andy Street and Business Secretary Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, who is MP for Bromsgrove. The visit to Birmingham was reportedly set be used to announce the relocation of hundreds of jobs to Birmingham for Chinese car manufacturer Changan Automobile, as well as other infrastructure announcements. However, Xi will now fly to Manchester, Osborne\u2019s preferred destination because of his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d initiative, where he will have lunch at Manchester town hall, visit Manchester University and tour Manchester City\u2019s stadium with David Cameron - though he is rumoured to be a Manchester United fan. A council source told the Birmingham Mail a business summit would be held on Wednesday for Chinese investors instead, saying: \u201cWe are meeting the money men, which is what matters most.\u201d Downing Street would not comment on the speculation. David Cameron\u2019s spokesman will not reveal how strongly he is prepared to object to China\u2019s steel-dumping in his meetings with Xi. She would only say he will \u201craise\u201d the matter and discuss how the actions of one country can impact on another. There is little sense that he plans to complain forcefully about China\u2019s behaviour. \u201cThere are a number of challenges - competitive pricing from China is one of them,\u201d she said, when asked whether Cameron agrees with the UK steel industry that Chinese dumping is to blame for its predicament. Our diplomatic editor has been with the crowds outside Horse Guards Parade as the President arrived. As the procession went past an array of big red and gold banners spelling out the message \u201cWelcome Big Buddy Xi\u201d the mostly Chinese crowd whooped in delight. They had been there since 8am some of them and had just enough battery power to take a selfie with the Queen and Xi riding by in the background Many in the crowd were exquisitely attuned to the nuances of royal protocol. Jing Aarons who lives in Knightsbridge said that it was very rare for a visiting head of state to ride in the Queen\u2019s golden carriage. \u201cThat almost never happens. Putin rode in an open-topped carriage. This is very special,\u201d she said and leapt into the air with pure joy. The Guardian\u2019s correspondent watched the Diamond Jubilee State coach sweep down past the protesters on the Mall. As Xi finally went past amid a parade of coaches, horsemen and security in Range Rovers, the Tibet protesters yelled and waved their flags, now behind three rows of barriers and police. The Chinese crowd next to them also yelled and honked vuvuzelas, but there was no real rancour or aggression from either group. And then it was done. Would Xi have seen the protest? Maybe, if he was looking in the right direction. Would he have noticed the vastly more numerous supportive crowd and their much bigger flags and banners, everywhere else on the Mall? Definitely. Julian Borger, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, was at the ceremony watching the cavalry process down to Horse Guards Parade. Here\u2019s Xi Jinping at Horse Guards Parade a few moments ago. The Chinese couple and the Royals are now arriving at Buckingham Palace. At London\u2019s Horse Guards Parade - Henry VIII\u2019s former jousting yard - David Cameron shook hands with Xi, who has hailed the visit as an \u201cimportant moment\u201d. The Queen also introduced the President to Home Secretary Theresa May, Alan Yarrow, the Lord Mayor of the City of London and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. Military top brass were also presented to China\u2019s leader - General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Chief of the Defence Staff, Vice Admiral Sir Philip Jones, The Fleet Commander, General Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of the General Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford, Chief of the Air Staff. Here\u2019s what went on during the short ceremony, according to the Press Association: Before the Queen and president on Horse Guards Parade was a guard of honour comprising 96 rank and file men and three officers from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. Major Benjamin Jesty, captain of the guard of honour, marched forward and presented his men giving the order in Mandarin. Speaking the language he has been practising for a number of weeks he said: \u201cThe Guard of Honour of 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards is present, formed up and ready for your inspection Sir\u201d. Philip joined the Chinese leader as he walked past the two rows of guardsmen wearing their scarlet tunics and bearskins. On the Mall, the drumming from pro-China protesters is drowning up the chants of \u2018Free Tibet\u2019 from Amnesty International and other groups. You can really hear the sheer noise of those Chinese groups in this video by Peter Walker. Xi Jinping has arrived at the welcome ceremony, the Queen is escorting the Chinese President into the gold carriage, and Prince Philip is following with Peng Liyuan. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have arrived now at Horse Guards Parade, in effect to collect President Xi for his short carriage ride to Buckingham Palace along the Mall. There will be a 41 gun salute - a key part of every state visit by a national leader. Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan will have an \u201cinformal lunch\u201d with the Royals after their trip down the Mall. Xi Jinping is about to arrive at Buckingham Palace - watch this live stream for his meeting with the Queen and the welcome ceremony. A guard of honour is welcoming the Chinese first couple on the Mall, which is decked in the flags of China and the UK. David Cameron and Theresa May have already arrived, and the Queen has departed from Buckingham Palace. The Chinese national anthem will be played and presentations made, as the Queen and Prince Philip accompany Xi and Peng in a state carriage procession to Buckingham Palace, where the president and his wife will lunch with the Queen and view items from the Royal Collection in the picture gallery of the palace. John Clark, community union rep for Dalzell, has just spoken to reporters outside the Tata steel plant in Motherwell, and criticised David Cameron\u2019s approach to his meeting with Xi Jinping. \u201cDavid Cameron is putting out the red carpet for the Chinese president. He be putting demands on the table instead,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe must see that this has been an ongoing situation and we have been trying to make the UK government aware of the situation for over two years.\u201d Tata had earlier blamed cheap Chinese imports in part for the job cuts announced today. Kate Allen, the UK director of Amnesty International, has been speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker at the protest on the Mall. Everything we\u2019ve heard about this visit suggests human rights are not on the agenda and that\u2019s not acceptable. China has a government where there are more executions in that one country than in the rest of the world combined, a government that has recently arrested 245 lawyers who have been working for ordinary people against the state and its corruption. Here\u2019s the full interview: There\u2019s a stronger showing from human rights protesters now as the time for Xi to sweep down the Mall draws closer. The Guardian\u2019s Simon Jenkins has been examining whether there is in indeed any point to Britain \u201craising human rights\u201d with the Chinese government during a state visit. British ministers are to \u201craise human right concerns\u201d with their Chinese guests this week. What on earth for? It is impolite, pointless, hypocritical and probably counter-productive. We are cringing supplicants for Chinese capital \u2013 as we claim to be for Saudi \u201cintelligence\u201d. What has this to do with human rights? The itch to pass judgment on other people\u2019s affairs is the occupational disease of British rulers. Sometime it drives us wretchedly to war, as in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. Otherwise it is merely rude, a diplomatic tic, a state of mind. If I were a Chinese at dinner tonight and a British minister dared to mention human rights, I would reply in kind. Read the full piece here: Joshua Wong, the student who became one of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy umbrella movement, is in London to protest the president\u2019s visit. He spoke at the Oxford Union last night. We hope to let Xi know that it is not possible to arrest people all over the world. However, the most important thing is the attitude of the British prime minister. He needs to raise the issue. Otherwise Xi will continue to focus on the core issue of investment. There\u2019s a party atmosphere down on the Mall as the pro-Chinese demonstrators await Xi\u2019s carriage. If Xi Jinping does spot any human rights protesters as he sweeps down the Mall to Buckingham Palace in about an hour, he\u2019ll need to look pretty carefully. So far a mere 15 or so metres of one side of the street is set aside for a few dozen protesters from the Falungong spiritual group, banned as a\u201dcult\u201d in China in 1999 and brutally repressed since. Some more rights activists are due there soon. The rest of the Mall is filled with many thousands of Chinese nationals beating flags and banners to welcome their president. It\u2019s a massive turnout, many deep already near the palace and several deep further away. The people I talked to - mainly young, many of them students in London - were reluctant to talk about human rights. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about this group,\u201d said Lulu Guo, an interior design student from southern China. \u201cI\u2019m here because it\u2019s exciting to see our president.\u201d There is clearly a significant element of organisation about the pro-Xi crowds, with many in identical \u201cI heart China\u201d t-shirts and carrying identical banners on telescopic poles. Some of the crowd insisted they had made the flags and banners themselves, but they could be seen being removed from boxes carrying freight labels from China Southern, an airline. One group of students referred all media to their \u201cleader\u201d, a man from Beijing who said he was a teacher on holiday with no official position. Despite the supposed ban on drums to drown out any human rights chants, there are many drummers here now. Our correspondent Peter Walker has found the source of the Chinese banners on the Mall for the protest today - they are, unsurprisingly, made in China. The Chinese written on the box shows that 270 pieces, weighing 4,024kg were shipped from the southern city of Guangzhou to Beijing earlier this month by China Southern Airlines. Tata Steel has confirmed that nearly 1,200 jobs will go in Scunthorpe and Scotland, blaming China in part for the collapse of the industry in a statement that will hang heavy over today\u2019s ceremonial proceedings. Tata said: there have been \u201ca shift in market conditions caused by a flood of cheap imports, particularly from China, a strong pound and high electricity costs.\u201d Follow our live coverage of the steel crisis here: There\u2019s quite a trend in the adverts in this morning\u2019s Financial Times - six full-page Chinese state-owned company adverts welcoming Xi Jinping to London, and a seventh centred on China from French bank BNP Paribas. There seems to be an unnerving uniformity to the \u201chomemade\u201d decorations the Chinese supporters have brought to their protest on the Mall. The Press Association\u2019s Joe Nerssessian has the (rather obvious) explanation. China expert James McGregor has some harsh words for the politicians cosying up to Xi on this visit, warning that Britain is acting like a \u201cpanting puppy\u201d which it would come to bitterly regret. The chairman of consultancy group APCO Worldwide\u2019s Chinese operations told the Today programme: This is incredible what\u2019s going on right now, with the British Government saying \u2018we want to be your best friend, we want to be your best friend, we\u2019ll do anything for it\u2019. Well, if you act like a panting puppy, the object of your attention is going to think they have got you on a leash. China does not respect people that suck up to him. I think England is going to rue the day they did this. It\u2019s certainly looking like a celebratory atmosphere on the Mall this morning, with pro-China protesters far outnumbering any human rights demonstrators so far. I\u2019ve been speaking to Willy Lam, the author of a recent book on Xi Jinping, about the state visit. Lam thinks China\u2019s strongman leader will be overjoyed with the reception he receives today as he is taken to Buckingham Palace. \u201cI think he will feel ecstatic. He will feel out of this world. The British royalty is perhaps the most storied monarchy in the world. Being afforded this welcome will give him a similar feeling to what he must have felt when he was overseeing the military parade in Beijing on 3 September,\u201d he says. Lam believes today\u2019s pomp and circumstance has significant political value to Xi Jinping whose domestic reputation as an all-powerful commander-in-chief has suffered this year because of the stock market turmoil in China. \u201cHis popularity has been dented,\u201d Lam says. \u201cMany people have lost money.\u201d Lam thinks Xi\u2019s reception in London will help him bolster China\u2019s reputation as a \u201csemi-super power\u201d. But, for Britain, the decision to roll out the reddest of carpets comes at a price. \u201cBritish people should know that this enthusiastic welcome that is being afforded to Xi Jinping will be used by the Communist party\u2019s propaganda department to burnish the reputation of an authoritarian leader who has significantly stepped up the crackdown on all kinds of dissent,\u201d he says. Many in Hong Kong, the former British colony where Lam lives, were furious that David Cameron appeared to be ignoring its struggle to wrestle democracy from Beijing. \u201cBritain has not said a single word but instead seems to be cuddling up to the new emperor,\u201d he said. Peter Walker has been out speaking to pro-Chinese demonstrators at the meticulously organised demonstration on The Mall this morning. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said Britain has its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d about China in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said: I don\u2019t think we are naive. It\u2019s very much in our national interest to engage with China but we do so with our eyes wide open,\u201d he added. I think we are developing a mature relationship with the Chinese. They know that we are looking not just to China but to many other countries for infrastructure investment in the UK. One of the key issues David Cameron has been urged to raise is the proliferation of cheaper Chinese steel and its devastating effect on British industry. The prime minister promised in the Commons on Monday that steel would be on his list of topics to discuss, as UK firm Caparo announced it was entering partial administration, with some 1,700 steel jobs at risk. Thousands more jobs have been lost in Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland earlier this month. Hammond told Radio 4 Today: If we had steel prices in the UK that were far out of line with the steel prices in other countries, our downstream industries would not be able to be competitive with the products they produce. So, we have got to get the balance right. Trying to protect our steel industry in a sensible way, which we are doing, but recognising that we operating in a global economy and we can\u2019t simply build a wall around the UK. The Guardian\u2019s Beijing correspondent has been looking over the Chinese press this morning. There are cartoons galore in Chinese state media today, commemorating the start of Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to Britain. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, has a three-minute animation showing Chairman Xi jetting off the London. \u201cThis is the first state visit to the UK in 10 years,\u201d a voice over enthuses. \u201cYou know how important it is!\u201d The cartoon features a mockup of the giant red carpet down which Xi will strut later on today. Editors at the China Daily have opted for a video listicle celebrating what politicians are calling the \u201cgolden friendship\u201d between London and Beijing. Among its list of the \u201c29 things that Chinese and British share\u201d the newspaper highlights binge drinking, politicians who like smoking, period dramas, great philosophers, a fondness for Susan Boyle and Jackie Chan, a passion for boat racing and.... comfy trains! Members of the pro-China protest are out on the Mall already to greet Xi Jinping, but their plans to drown out human rights demonstrators with a chorus of drumming have been scuppered by the royal parks regulations. My colleagues Ben Quinn and Vikram Dodd report this morning that the drummers cannot play in St James\u2019 Park. Hundreds of protesters from Amnesty International, pro-Tibetan groups and other Chinese dissident groups are also planning to gather in the park on Tuesday morning before Xi is driven along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. It seems the pro-China protesters are earlier risers, according to Peter Walker. Last night, Prince William made a direct appeal to Chinese people to boycott ivory and other endangered animal products used in traditional medicine. The country is a key consumer of ivory, with demand for the valuable tusks threatening dwindling elephant populations. The speech at King\u2019s College London, on the eve of the presidential visit, was recorded for popular Chinese television show \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d - greeting viewers in Mandarin by saying xiexie, hen gaoxing he ni jianmian - \u201cThank you, I\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d \u201cIn the 33 years since I was born, we have lost around 70 percent of Africa\u2019s elephant population. Of those that are left, 20,000 are being killed every year - that is 54 elephants killed every single day,\u201d William said, in a speech that acknowledged the role his own ancesters had played in fuelling the demand for luxury goods made from wild species. \u201cAt this rate, children born this year, like my daughter Charlotte, will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdays,\u201d he said. William, who is one of the tallest members of the Royal family at 6ft 3, still had to crane his neck as he met legendary Chinese Basketball player Yao Ming, who is more than a foot taller at 7ft 6. Here\u2019s the official schedule for Xi\u2019s activities today: 9.15am Charles and Camilla go to greet Xi at Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge 10.30am Ceremonial welcome by Queen on Horse Guards Parade 11.45am State carriage arrival at Buckingham Palace - protesters are expected to demonstrate on the Mall as the president arrives to highlight human rights abuses in China 1.30pm Xi will view a display of Chinese items in Royal Collection 3.15pm The Chinese president will address both Houses of Parliament 4.20pm Tea with Charles and Camilla at Clarence House 5.00pm Xi will be greeted by Prince William then meet Jeremy Corbyn at Buckingham Palace prior to State Banquet, which the Duchess of Cambridge will also attend 7.20pm Speeches at the State Banquet speeches at Buckingham Palace Here\u2019s Xi Jinping arriving with his wife Peng Liyuan at Heathrow Airport last night for the four-day state visit. Good morning, we\u2019re liveblogging the visit of Xi Jinping, the first visit to Britain by a Chinese president in a decade. The state visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping will be an \u201cimportant moment\u201d for relations between the UK and Beijing, David Cameron said ahead of the first official engagements of the tour. Ministers expect more than 30 billion of trade and investment deals to be struck during the four-day visit. Among the business deals set to be sealed is an accord that could see the Chinese take a key role in constructing nuclear plants at Hinkley Point in Somerset, Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. In the Commons on Monday, Cameron also confirmed that the crisis in the steel industry would be raised with the Chinese. Downing Street has rejected accusations of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to Beijing for the sake of commercial deals, insisting that no subject will be off the table in talks. Protesters from Free Tibet, Amnesty UK and other groups are planning to shine a spotlight on China\u2019s human rights violations, gathering near the Mall to demonstrate as Xi passes by in a state carriage procession to Buckingham Palace. A rival pro-China protest is also due at the same location. Xi will address both Houses of Parliament today and the the Prime Minister has also invited the president to his official Chequers country retreat. Other guests at Buckingham Palace tonight as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, will be Cameron, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other politicians and dignitaries. Corbyn has pledged to raise rights issues when he calls on Xi at the palace ahead of the state banquet. This will be the first state banquet at Buckingham Palace for Duchess of Cambridge will attend her this evening, with frenzied speculation on fashion sites about what tiara she will choose for the event. The Prince of Wales, who is a supporter of the Dalai Lama and who has had a difficult relationship with China\u2019s leadership in the past, will miss the state banquet in the evening but will greet Xi and his wife at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and escort them to Horse Guards Parade for the ceremonial welcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
