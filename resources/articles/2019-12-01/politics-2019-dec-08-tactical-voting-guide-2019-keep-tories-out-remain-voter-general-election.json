The Conservatives are on course for an overall majority in parliament \u2013 but most voters will back parties that want to block an early Brexit. If turnout is similar to last time, the 14 to 15 million who will support the Conservatives or Brexit party will be outnumbered by the 16 to 17 million who will vote Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru. Tactical voting is not new, but it has a special significance this week. If it happens in enough constituencies, it can ensure that the two-million majority opposed to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is reflected in the new House of Commons. The map below shows 50 seats where tactical voting could keep the Conservatives out. Most tactical voting websites draw on one or two sets of polling data, which risk ignoring the specific circumstances of individual constituencies. The guide draws on a wider range of information \u2013 detailed big-sample national polls, but also constituency surveys (including those reported week by week in the Observer), past election results and local activity, such as the recent student registration drives in some key seats (one is Brunel University, in Johnson\u2019s own constituency, Uxbridge). The three latest constituency surveys underline the potential impact of tactical voting. Putney, Southport and Guildford all elected Conservative MPs last time, despite voting heavily to remain in the 2016 referendum. Currently, the Conservatives lead Labour in Putney (by 3%) and Southport (by 8%). Guildford is almost neck-and-neck between the Lib Dems (41%) and the Conservatives (40%). Given margins of error on local surveys with samples of 500, all three seats are in play. Enough tactical votes for Labour in Putney and Southport, and the Lib Dems in Guildford, could defeat the Tories in all three seats. However, without tactical voting, these three seats \u2013 like many others \u2013 may well return pro-Brexit MPs, despite having clear Remain majorities, because of the way the anti-Conservative vote divides. In the map, each choice is briefly explained. The 50 seats include 33 in England and Wales that elected Tory MPs last time. The Lib Dems are recommended in 18 seats, Labour in 13 and former Conservatives in two: Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, now standing as independents and backed this weekend by John Major. (Another former Tory backed by Major, Anne Milton in Guildford, has only 7% support in our latest poll. Major\u2019s support risks siphoning votes from the Lib Dems, and letting the Conservatives retain the seat.) It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour. In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. There are four exceptions: two in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys M\u00f4n) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives. Scotland presents a specific challenge. A number of traditional Labour strongholds went SNP in 2015 and then Conservative in 2017. In these \u2013 as well as Gordon, a former Lib Dem seat, and Moray, once an SNP bastion \u2013 the SNP are now best placed to see off the Conservatives.
