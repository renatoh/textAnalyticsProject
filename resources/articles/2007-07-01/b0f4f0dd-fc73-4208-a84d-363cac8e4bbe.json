I know which I prefer. This dish is currently on the menu at our new restaurant, Wild Honey, which opened in London at the start of this month. I'll give you three guesses where our melons come from (clue: eight letters, starts with a \"P\" and ends in \"rovence\"). 1 charentais melon 200g small broad beans (podded weight) 200g small peas (podded weight) Good quality olive oil (from Les Baux de Provence for preference) Salt and pepper 100g young salad leaves 8 thin slices Bayonne (or Parma) ham (preferably with lots of fat) 200g fresh goats' curd (I get mine from La Fromagerie in London, 020-7935 0341) Cut the melon into quarters and remove and discard the seeds. Peel the melon quarters, then trim them and cut into bite-sized pieces. Blanch the beans in boiling salted water for a couple of minutes, drain and refresh under cold water. Put the beans in a bowl, add the raw peas and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Add the salad leaves and set aside. Preheat the grill to high, then place the ham under and cook until crisp, taking care that it does not catch. Place a pile of the goats' curd in the centre of four plates, add five or six pieces of melon, then scatter over the peas, beans and leaves. Neatly lay two slices of ham on each plate, drizzle each serving with a tablespoon of olive oil and serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
