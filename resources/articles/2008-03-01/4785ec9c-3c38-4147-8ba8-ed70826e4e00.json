The Gunners' best chance came after 42 seconds, when Emmanuel Adebayor raced onto a through-ball and struck a low shot, which Chris Kirkland thwarted on the edge of the box. Kirkland was called into action again in the 10th minute to tip Nicklas Bendtner's long-range shot around the post, but following that Arsenal struggled to create any clear-cut chances. Wigan defended heroically for a point to aid their cause, and although the leaders moved onto 66 points - two ahead of Manchester United, having played a match more - they missed an opportunity to increase the pressure on their main rivals. Elsewhere, Spurs piled further pressure on Alan Curbishley by inflicting a third 4-0 thrashing in three games upon the East Londoners. Luis Boa Morte's sending off for a late tackle on Aaron Lennon didn't help the Hammers' cause in the 44th minute, but early goals from Dimitar Berbatov had already forced West Ham to play with an air of desperation. The result was put beyond doubt by a drilled 85th minute effort from Da Silva Melo Gilberto and a Darren Bent header in the 90th minute. In the race for fourth place Everton recorded their fourth Premier League win in a row thanks to a scrappy second-half goal. Mikel Arteta swung a cross in towards Tim Cahill and Andrew Johnson and the ball appeared to make contact with the latter's upper arm before crossing the goal-line. Everton are now level on points with neighbours Liverpool on 56 points but stay fifth due to an inferior goal difference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
