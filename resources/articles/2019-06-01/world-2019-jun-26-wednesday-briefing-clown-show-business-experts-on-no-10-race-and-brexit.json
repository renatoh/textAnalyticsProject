Two former members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have made critical remarks over the Conservative leadership race and Brexit. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance said companies would want a safe pair of hands running Britain rather than the \u201cerratic\u201d Boris Johnson; while David Blanchflower said the race to be the next prime minister was \u201cincreasingly looking like a clown show, and as far as discussions of economics go, they are basically in fantasyland\u201d. The prospect of Johnson or Jeremy Hunt allowing the country to walk away without a deal on 31 October has alarmed business groups and put renewed pressure on the pound, according to analysis by the Guardian. Britain\u2019s next prime minister will take charge of an economy that is faltering because of all the uncertainty, our Brexit Watch for June shows. In the leadership race, Hunt has suggested there is \u201cno trust\u201d in Johnson to fulfil his promises on Brexit, telling the BBC he believes he has the better personality to be prime minister. After Johnson challenged him to commit to taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d, Hunt said: \u201cIf there isn\u2019t and if no deal is still on the table I\u2019ve been very clear. I will leave the European Union without a deal. But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart, because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is still holding back on giving Labour\u2019s full-throated backing for remain, and this morning Jon Cruddas argues the issue is not so simple that the party can just \u201cstop triangulating, offer some leadership and hoover up the votes of remainers\u201d. * * * Outbreak of deadly strep \u2013 Twelve people have died in the Essex area and 20 more have been infected by invasive group A streptococcus bacteria (iGas), Public Health England has said. Those infected have been elderly people receiving treatment for wounds in care homes and their own homes, according to NHS Mid Essex. The cases are spread across the Braintree, Chelmsford city and Maldon districts. Rachel Hearn, from NHS Mid Essex, said extra infection control measures had been put in place to prevent the infection spreading in the area. \u201cThe risk of contracting iGAS is very low for the vast majority of people and treatment with antibiotics is very effective if started early,\u201d she said. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Trump-Russia investigator Robert Mueller will testify to Congress in July, it has been announced overnight. Iran has suggested Donald Trump has a \u201cmental disorder\u201d while Trump has threatened \u201cobliteration\u201d if Iran attacks \u201canything American\u201d.

Milkman by Anna Burns won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing went to Patrick Radden Keefe for Say Nothing. * * * \u2018Cyber-flashers\u2019 targeted \u2013 Revenge porn victims may get automatic anonymity in court if changes to online harassment laws go ahead. \u201cCyber-flashing\u201d, when people receive unsolicited sexual images on their phone, and \u201cdeepfake pornography\u201d, where someone\u2019s face is superimposed on to pornographic photos or videos, could be criminalised. \u201cThis review will build on our recent work to make upskirting and revenge porn illegal to protect victims and ensure perpetrators feel the full weight of the law,\u201d said Paul Maynard, the justice minister. Separately, unions, charities and women\u2019s rights groups are campaigning to make employers liable if they fail to protect their staff from sexual harassment at work. * * * Clean air policies slowly working \u2013 Early deaths linked to dirty air in the UK fell by half from 1970 to 2010 but toxic air remains the number one environmental health hazard, causing one in 20 deaths, researchers say. They call for urgent government action to deal with a public health emergency on a par with alcohol abuse. Targeting coal power stations has produced cleaner air, while more recent falls in small-particle and nitrogen dioxide pollution from vehicles have followed stronger EU regulations. But ammonia from farms, which mixes with city air to form dangerous particles, has yet to be stringently tackled, the scientists say, and ozone pollution has risen. * * * Allen key to the door \u2013 Ikea has been given the green light to build affordable homes in UK. Worthing council has approved 162 flats to be constructed by BoKlok, the retailer\u2019s joint venture with construction firm Skanska. The firm sets property prices so that buyers have money left to live on after they have paid their housing costs, and its website says \u201ca single parent can afford to buy and live in a newly built two-bedroom BoKlok apartment\u201d. It has built 11,000 homes across Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. Today in Focus podcast: Ebola is back. Can it be contained?
