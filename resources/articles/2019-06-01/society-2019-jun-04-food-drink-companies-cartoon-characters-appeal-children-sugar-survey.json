The research has been compiled by a coalition of health groups, which accuses manufacturers and retailers of manipulating children and parents into purchasing unhealthy products. In the biggest survey of its kind to date, Action on Sugar, Action on Salt and the Children\u2019s Food Campaign found 51% of the more than 500 food and drink products assessed did not meet the health requirements to advertise on TV during children\u2019s programmes, or on the Transport for London network. The health groups are urging the government to ban the use of TV and film characters to market unhealthy products to children, and to make \u201ctraffic light\u201d nutrition labelling compulsory. For the exercise, 526 products with packaging deemed to be child-friendly, ranging from sweets, chocolate and snack bars to tinned pasta, smoothies and yogurts, were selected. All are sold in major UK supermarkets. Peppa Pig Candy Bites were singled out for containing 99% sugar. Kinnerton\u2019s Paw Patrol mini chocolate bars, which are more than 60% sugar and 17% saturated fat, were also among the worst offenders: one 12g bar would provide a four- to six-year-old with 38% of their maximum daily recommended intake for sugar. Dr Moo\u2019s Quick Milk Magic Sipper Strawberry had 94g of sugar per 100g, equating to 1.4 teaspoons of sugar per straw. Kinnerton Confectionery declined to comment on the findings. Bazooka Candy Brands International, the manufacturer of Peppa Pig Candy Bites, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dr Kather Hashem, a nutritionist and campaign lead at Action on Sugar, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that companies are exploiting the health of our children by using cartoon characters on their high-sugar food and drink products, particularly on chocolates and sweets, which are already hard to resist for children. \u201cDo we really need to entice children to want these products more and pester their parents to buy them? It is time for regulation to curtail the industry\u2019s unhealthy habits.\u201d Only 18 healthy food and drink products such as fruit, vegetables and water were found to use child-friendly cartoons, with Lidl commended for its Oaklands range of fruit and veg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
