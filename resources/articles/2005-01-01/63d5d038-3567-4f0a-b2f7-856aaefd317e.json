Now workers fear it might become the British bar that comes from afar. Workers at the Mars factory in Slough, Berkshire, have been told that the confectioner - which also makes Twix bars, Snickers and Maltesers - is launching a consultation within its European business to address \"sales growth, manufacturing capacity, overheads and ways of working\". It has left Britain's strong tradition of making chocolate facing yet another blow as fears grow about the future of one of the largest confectionery businesses in the world, along with 1,600 jobs at the site. Trade unions at the Slough plant fear that Britain will bear the brunt of such a restructuring, following years of gloom for the country's confectionery industry. Rob Anderson, the leader of Slough council's Labour group, is reported to have said \"rumours that Mars is pulling out make for worrying times\". The plant has been in Slough since the 1930s. This is the last year of production of Terry's chocolates at York, after more than 200 years. The site produces Terry's Chocolate Orange and the All Gold tray. The firm's owner, Kraft Foods, has moved production to plants in Sweden and Poland to save cash. Rowntree, owned by Swiss firm Nestl\u00e9, has slashed its British workforce. Cadbury Schweppes also cut jobs at its Bournville plant in Birmingham last year. A Mars spokesman told the BBC that he would not comment as the outcome of the consultation was not known. The firm is legendary for its secrecy. Although it is one of the world's biggest companies, it is still privately owned. It is in the hands of the family of founder Forrest Mars, who died in 1999 at the age of 95. The family, including Forrest Mars Junior, Jacqueline Mars and John Mars, are now counted as three of the richest people in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
