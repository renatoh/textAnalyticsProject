Called targetedGRAD, the new service will operate just like a commercial dot.com recruitment agency. Students and graduates from participating universities will be able to submit their personal and career details to a central database accessed by hiring employers. This may sound like just another website competing for your email address, but with around two dozen careers services signing up, targetedGRAD has the potential to dominate the top end of the graduate recruitment market. \"Unlike other dot.coms, targetedGRAD will draw on the support of hundreds of careers and academic staff across the country,\" claims a spokesperson for the new service. \"These staff will actively promote targetedGRAD to students interested in careers with blue-chip companies. Combined with the credibility of being owned and delivered by the higher education sector we believe this will give targetedGRAD an incredibly strong presence on campus.\" By exploiting this privileged position, targetedGRAD has the potential to create an enormous database of the most eagerly sought-after students. Little wonder therefore that blue-chip employers seem so pleased with the new service. \"It is a very innovative idea,\" says Michael Hunting, national director of graduate recruitment with law firm Eversheds, \"both because of its simplicity and because of the impressive range of the universities involved. TargetedGrad will allow us to target our communications directly to the students we are interested in, and know that it will reach them. \"One of the main problems with some of the established online services is that creating truly bespoke messages can be difficult. We never really know that we are reaching the relevant people. If I needed five recruits for the London office at short notice for example, I could use targetedGRAD to limit our emails to appropriate students.\" \"The biggest benefit is the enormous savings the service offers in terms of time,\" says Sue Polley recruitment adviser with ExxonMobil. \"Instead of having to send separate emails to 20 different careers services, we can access them all through one system.\" TargetedGrad represents a major threat to the recruitment sites which over the last few years have been eroding careers services' domination of information to students. \"It is an interesting development,\" says Tom Hughes, managing director of Milkround Online. \"However, I suspect that it might face two problems. First, recruitment is an intensely sales-driven industry, and I wonder whether an organisation with an academic, advice-orientated culture can make the necessary transition. Secondly, from our perspective, the whole 100 or so universities are stronger together than they would be if they split into consortiums. This division may open up new opportunities for us.\" By banding together to form their own consortium, the top universities have shattered the all-for-one-and-one-for-all ethos of the careers service. Although national careers service organisations such as AGCAS recognise that employers target the higher-ranked universities, they attempt to maintain the consensus that all degrees are more or less equal in terms of what they add to your employability. On the other hand, individual careers services are keenly aware that they are actually in competition with other universities to place their students in the best jobs. The creation of targetedGRAD means that for the first time a large group of careers services is encouraging rather than merely tolerating the practice of targeting. With more emphasis being placed on employability, targetedGRAD could help define what might become a premier league of UK universities. And, as in football, targetedGRAD could take more and more of the recruitment pie, causing problems for lower ranking universities and their graduates. The Higher Education Careers Services Unit (CSU), which publishes Prospects, is however cautiously upbeat about the challenge posed by targetedGRAD. \"We already run a successful online job advertising service,\" says Mike Williams deputy chief executive of CSU. \"Our audited figures show that we receive more than 2m page impressions from over 100,000 individual users per month. \"Employers can send more than 10m individual messages or search our CV database system. We are committed to making sure that this service is widely available. However, we look forward to co-operating with targetedGRAD.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
