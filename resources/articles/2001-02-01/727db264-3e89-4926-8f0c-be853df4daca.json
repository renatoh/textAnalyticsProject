Sven-Goran Eriksson comes across as a coach of eminent good sense with no time for fanciful theories. For him, therefore, it is absolutely logical that for tonight's friendly against Spain David Beckham will keep the captain's armband he wore for the first time in Italy last November. \"I don't see any reason to change the captain,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"I hope he will keep the captaincy for a long time, but we've never looked at that. I think he can be a leader and I thought he did the job very well in Italy. \"I don't think that being captain is heavy work but it's important to have someone able to talk to the referee when it's necessary - and many times it is necessary.\" Beckham, then, is Eriksson's first England captain largely because he was the man in possession when the Swede took over. And from the way Eriksson was talking yesterday it looks as if the Manchester United player will spend at least half of tonight's game in familiar company. England's latest strip features a thin red line running down one side of the white shirt, designed to capture the spirit of St George. Yet Eriksson's initial starting line-up may well involve a much broader red reminder of the success of Sir Alex. Ferguson, that is, at least six of whose players could kick off against Spain: Gary Neville and Wes Brown in defence, Beckham and Nicky Butt in midfield, and Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole up front. Should Paul Scholes recover from a stomach bug in time he could be a seventh, in which case United would equal Arsenal's 1935 record when seven of their players appeared against Italy in the notorious battle of Highbury. \"It would be ideal to have as many as possible from the same big club,\" Eriksson mused, \"although so far I've only looked at the players as individuals.\" But if the coach feels that using a large part of Manchester United tonight will be more likely to help him formulate a team for the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania next month, that is what will happen. Apart from naming Beckham captain the only information about his team Eriksson would divulge yesterday was that it would play in a 4-4-2 formation with one of the front pair playing off the other. \"I think that playing two strikers up front doesn't work,\" he explained, \"so maybe we'll play one up with one behind.\" Sheringham, Scholes and Robbie Fowler are each capable of the supporting role and clearly Eriksson has Emile Heskey earmarked as the main striker. Eriksson has knocked around Europe for 25 years and knows a few international wrinkles at club level. A good result for England tonight, plus the performance to go with it, would quell the chauvinistic antipathy to the idea of a foreign coach. The Football Association may see the next World Cup but one as the earliest that anyone can expect to see England re-emerge as a team capable of winning a major tournament but Eriksson will be judged by tomorrow's headlines, not those of 2006. The size of the task facing him should not be underestimated. He is the fifth England coach in the 12 years that have elapsed since Bobby Robson's side reached the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup. Subsequently England have flopped under Graham Taylor, revived briefly under Terry Venables, found a short salvation under Glenn Hoddle and fallen apart under Kevin Keegan. Or to put it another way they have gone from Turnip to Tel-boy to trial by Drewery to tears before bedtime. The least Eriksson deserves is a period of calm while he takes stock of his resources under match conditions. \"I will be very, very happy if I know my best team after tomorrow's match,\" he said, \"but football has never been that easy. I just hope I know more about England tomorrow night than I did three days ago.\" Beating a Spain team rich in experience and technique would not be bad for starters. But if Eriksson's first England team turns out to be an uneasy hybrid and flops accordingly he will surely be in for an early bout of critical Swede-bashing. Possible teams England (first half, 4-4-2): Seaman; G Neville, Brown, Campbell, Powell; Beckham, Butt, Scholes, Barmby; Sheringham, Andy Cole. England (second half): James; P Neville, Ferdinand, Campbell, Ashley Cole; Beckham, Carragher, Lampard, Barmby; Heskey, Fowler. Spain (4-3-2-1): Casillas; Pablo, Paco, Abelardo, Sergi; Guardiola, Helguera, Luis Enrique; Mendieta, Raul; Urzaiz. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
