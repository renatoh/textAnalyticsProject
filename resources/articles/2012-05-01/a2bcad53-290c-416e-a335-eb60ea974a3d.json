Graham Brady, Tory MP for Altrincham and chair of the powerful 1922 backbench committee, spent a week in the Caymans in April. The trip to these sunny Caribbean isles cost \u00a38,600, but it was all free for Brady, according to his latest entry on the register of members' interests. In return for very vague sounding duties, \"to attend a great number of events and meetings and participate in a very wide ranging number of topics with the government and other interested parties\", the Cayman Islands government paid for the lot. No surprise, perhaps, that a fairly rightwing Tory like Brady should be happy fact-finding on the Caymans, which are very heavily involved in the offshore tax business. But worry not. Brady was not alone: Ayrshire Labour MP Brian Donohoe was there to keep him company. \u2022 What exactly did care services minister Paul Burstow brandish when he addressed social services directors a fortnight ago? He said the papers in his hand were the long-awaited social care bill, designed to start sorting out the crisis in the care and support of older and disabled people. Sadly, no one got close enough to check. For now there's speculation, conspicuously not being denied by Burstow's department, that the coalition is to break its pledge to introduce the bill in the second session of parliament. The Queen's speech next week will, it is said, merely refer to ministers being given \"drafting authority\" to prepare legislation for a future session. So if the statute still needs drafting, what was the minister's prop at the directors' conference at Warwick University? That morning's Racing Post? \u2022 They're playing for keeps in the London mayoral race, with the favourite, Boris Johnson, all potty mouthed on TV, referring to a story by Tim Donovan, political editor for the BBC in the capital, as \"fucking bollocks\". 'Twas just last month that the Latin scholar first descended to the language of the shop floor when he denounced his opponent Ken Livingstone as a \"fucking liar\". Despite this, the Mail and the Sun, sticklers both for communal civility, insist Boris is their man. Yes, it's looking good for Boris, the one downside being that for four more years he'll be cursed by the forensic attentions of reporter Donovan, who is to the mayor what Kryptonite was to Superman. Johnson, never the master of detail and fearful of being kebabbed on live television, hasn't submitted to a full interview with the political editor in London for over a year. \u2022 A worrying precedent, meanwhile, for all who equate a fair day's work with a fair day's pay. The evangelical charity WEC International seeks a chief subeditor for one of its publications. Usual requirements, the ability to work to tight deadlines, love of accuracy, attention to detail, willingness to write the occasional feature. No salary, zilch. But then: \"All WEC personnel look to God to provide their personal needs.\" Rail chiefs should try that with Aslef. \u2022 A clarification; for yesterday we pooh-poohed the idea of Dr David Starkey as one of our best loved historians, mainly because the claim originated from Dr David Starkey. We are taken to task, because at the University of Hull they have their own Dr David Starkey: David J Starkey. He's also a historian \u2013 maritime, as you ask \u2013 he is indeed much loved, and he has never testified to seeing white people turn black or uttered any other inanities on Newsnight. Here's to the other David Starkey. It can't be easy being him. \u2022 Finally, Lord Archer tells Saga magazine that he always knew how to make a shilling. Indeed, many of his defining characteristics were there from an early age. \"There was a craze at school for collecting cheese labels,\" says Jeffrey. \"So I wrote to a company producing Gruy\u00e8re and they sent me a huge batch \u2013 which I sold in the playground, using the profits to buy my mother a 30-shilling watch. My mother rang up the headmaster, very concerned. She said: 'I only gave Jeffrey 10 shillings to spend at the beginning of term.'\" And what does that tell you? She didn't trust him either. twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
