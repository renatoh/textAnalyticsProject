In the most bullish comments from a cabinet minister since the intervention by the aerospace company\u2019s chief executive, Hunt said businesses sounding the alarm about job losses risked undermining the government at a key moment in the negotiations. \u201cIt was completely inappropriate for businesses to be making these kinds of threats, for one simple reason,\u201d the health secretary told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. \u201cWe are in a critical moment in the Brexit discussions. We need to get behind Theresa May to deliver the best possible Brexit, a clean Brexit.\u201d Hunt said the best way for businesses to achieve the \u201cclarity and certainty\u201d they needed was to back the prime minister in her negotiations with Brussels. \u201cThe more we undermine Theresa May, the more likely we are to end up with a fudge, which would be an absolute disaster for everyone,\u201d he said. His comments were echoed by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who said the UK\u2019s negotiating position was being undermined by those urging the government to take \u201cno deal\u201d off the table. \u201cIf we actually say we\u2019ll accept any deal you give us rather than walk away, that weakens our negotiating position,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \u201cAnd people who are making these comments need to understand that they may be actually putting the UK at a disadvantage by making these cases.\u201d Over the weekend, BMW followed Airbus in warning about the consequences of Brexit uncertainty, saying the carmaker needed clarity on customs arrangements within months. Airbus, which employs 14,000 people in the UK, has said a no-deal scenario directly threatens its future in the country. Further pressure came as the biggest business groups in the UK wrote a stinging letter to the prime minister, as well as to the European council president, Donald Tusk, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Sunday, demanding greater input for business in the negotiations. Business leaders have been further angered by reports that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, allegedly responded to a question about companies\u2019 Brexit concerns at a diplomatic reception this month by saying: \u201cFuck business.\u201d Hunt said it was not surprising there was concern from businesses about the impact of Brexit, but it was not in the interests of the European commission to say the negotiations were going well. \u201cThat\u2019s part of their negotiating tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to ignore these siren voices \u2026 get on and support Theresa May. If you look at the approach Theresa May has taken to Brexit so far, she has the instincts of a Brexiteer but the cautious pragmatism of a remainer, which is where I think the British people are. She brings incredible resilience and we have to allow her to get on and negotiate this deal.\u201d The CBI\u2019s deputy director, Joshua Hardie, hit back at Hunt\u2019s remarks on Twitter: Former minister Digby Jones, a Brexit supporter, also sounded a note of caution about the need to secure an acceptable exit deal. \u201cIf ... we are at civil war in Britain, which we are, and at the same time you\u2019ve got an EU who, or should I say Germany, who are going to play this right the way down to midnight on 29 March \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they \u2013 then what you\u2019ve got is, yes you\u2019re right, falling off the edge will be a catastrophe,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live. In his interview, Hunt also dismissed criticism of government claims that a \u00a320bn a year NHS spending increase would come partly from a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said does not exist, given economic forecasts about the impact on growth of leaving the EU. He said there would not be very much extra cash by the time Britain leaves the EU in 2019, given the financial settlement with Brussels. \u201cGoing forward, we will have settled that,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of those experts have been proved wrong before in their forecasts and we actually think the British economy can get through this very challenging period, but we don\u2019t know exactly when and what the impact will be.\u201d The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said Hunt\u2019s comments were \u201ccalibrated more to appeal to his Brexiteer colleagues than to reflect reality\u201d, and businesses were right to speak out. \u201cWhilst the Conservatives may wish to ignore reality and pat each other on the back after two years of achieving precisely nothing in the Brexit negotiations, they cannot expect businesses to act in the same way.\u201d The intervention by businesses comes ahead of this week\u2019s European council summit, where May is under pressure to show some progress on customs arrangments and the Irish border. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, will meet chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday and meet MEPs. Bradley said she would reiterate the UK government\u2019s commitment to securing a Brexit deal that would avoid a hard border. \u201cWe are confident that we will secure a good deal for the whole of the UK, and we are working towards finalising this with the EU in autumn,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we do, we will ensure that our departure from the EU does not do anything to set back the historic progress we have made in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years, and that the Belfast agreement is protected in all its parts. This is the message I will be reinforcing during my meetings today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
