We caught up with him just after he\u2019d taken the stage at King Princess\u2019s show in a wig. Hi Mark. You\u2019ve only been at Glastonbury a few hours and you\u2019ve already managed to rock up on stage at someone else\u2019s gig. How come? I went on stage with [queer pop star] King Princess, who\u2019s signed to my label. She was very sweet. She asked me to come up and perform the song with her. She\u2019s so \u201chands off my music\u201d, very fiercely independent and rightfully so, cos her stuff\u2019s great and I don\u2019t want to ruin it. So when she asked I got a little teared up. I came on dressed as her. It was cute. You make a lot of guest appearances at the festival. Is it just a spur of the moment thing? There are rehearsals. I flew to Denmark this morning to rehearse with Miley Cyrus [for a surprise appearance on her Sunday set]. The only way we could rehearse was by me going to a festival she was playing at. Everybody wants their stuff to sound good. Everyone\u2019s a bit of a perfectionist. It\u2019s not just a case of jumping on a pair of decks. Can you remember your first experience at Glastonbury? Because I moved to the States when I was pretty young, I didn\u2019t ever experience Glastonbury until I played it. I heard people talking about the festival as this mythological thing, but you don\u2019t truly understand until you get there. My first one was 2007. It was really muddy. I remember Wale, the rapper from DC, was touring with us and wouldn\u2019t get off his tour bus. He saw the mud and went \u201cno way.\u201d And then we found out that the night before Dizzee Rascal had worn binbags over his shoes so that he could go on with Arctic Monkeys. So we got Wale off the bus [using binbags]. Binbags aside, what\u2019s the wildest moment you\u2019ve experienced at Glastonbury? The first year I really had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea of the lay of the land and I was staying at some place off site. I got lost leaving on Saturday because I was staying at some late rave. And our set was on Sunday. So I was kind of freaked out, thinking: \u201cI do need to get some sleep.\u201d It starts raining, and suddenly I see a man coming over the hill. I\u2019m like \u201cThank God, he\u2019s going to tell me where to go\u201d. It turns out he was like a super drunk farmer with 40 sheep behind him. He was cogent enough to direct me, and I went to sleep, but after that I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not risking this luck any more. I\u2019ll stay on site.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had a bad time here. Even just coming here to play a DJ set is interesting. It\u2019s hard to do it wrong unless you have a bad attitude. Speaking of rain, you were here in 2016 for the notorious Brexit Glastonbury. What are your memories of that? Brexit happened the day before. It was such a fucking crazy, down vibe. It was really muddy too, and I could tell that I stayed up a little late past my bedtime because all these pictures were of me and Kevin [Parker] wandering through mud and really looking a bit \u201call right mate, go to sleep\u201d. What is the one festival essential you can\u2019t live without? You\u2019ve got to have a toothbrush, and a phone is good. But beyond that I think it\u2019s very much a \u2018go with the flow\u2019 thing. As a veteran, are there any secret tips you would give to newcomers? It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go. You plan to see all these things when you get here and you just end up having a drink at some bar and that\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re just hearing the music seep over you from the background. That\u2019s the vibe, not to get too caught up with the schedule and the map. Do that at other festivals. Here\u2019s a bit more in the moment. That must be a little harder when you\u2019re famous. Are you able to visit Glasto incognito? I like going out. This year I\u2019ve got two film cameras and have been going out taking pictures of the crowd and stage. I just wanted to talk to people for fun and do amateur photography. It\u2019s super fun to get into the crowd. If you don\u2019t get into the crowd, you can\u2019t feel the spirit. I understand there\u2019s a certain level of star, like Miley, who can\u2019t go walking around. But this might be the one place where the vibe is chill. Do you think Miley Cyrus will be roaming around then? She told me she wants to get stuck in on Sunday night. She made me promise I would stay for it. I want to invite her to my club night on Saturday, but I couldn\u2019t in good conscience make her go to a 5am rave the night before her big set. I\u2019ve told her, \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d The thing is she\u2019s so generous, she\u2019d want to come. And she\u2019d kill it. But you\u2019ve got to save yourself for the big one on Sunday. Get your beauty sleep."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
