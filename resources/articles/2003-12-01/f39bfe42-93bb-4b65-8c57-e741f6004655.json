AND FINALLY \"Richard Ogust found his calling in Chinatown,\" reports the Associated Press. \"There, he met Empress, a black-and-orange diamondback terrapin trapped in a tank at an all-you-can-eat buffet.\" Empress was the first of more than a thousand tortoises, turtles and terrapins to have passed through Mr Ogust's ninth-floor walk-up apartment in Tribeca, New York. \"I tend to take things very far once I start them,\" he confided. Now he is trying to raise funds for a new menagerie to house his charges, who occupy more than 100 heated tanks at a cost of USD20,000 per month - a third of which goes on food alone. The walk-up reportedly \"buzzes with flies and smells like a fish kill\". \"They come from illegal shipments, Asian food markets and even zoos, which entrust the rarest of species to his care,\" AP reports. \"Of 60 critically endangered Arrakine Forrest turtles currently in the US, 34 reside in Mr Ogust's apartment. For now, they are not disturbing anyone. Mr Ogust, who has an inheritance, owns the building, which is being renovated.\" A new site has been chosen: Tewksbury, New Jersey, near Princeton University. Mr Ogust estimates the cost of building a new greenhouse and renovating a barn to house the reptiles at USD600,000. Source * The Informer welcomes unusual news reports and intriguing columns.
