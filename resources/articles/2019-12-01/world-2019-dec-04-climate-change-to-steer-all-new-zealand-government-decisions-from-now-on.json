Minister James Shaw said cabinet \u201croutinely\u201d considers the effects of its decisions on human rights, the Treaty of Waitangi, rural communities, the disability community, and gender. Now climate change will become a standard part of cabinet\u2019s decision-making too, in a week in which the country has being battered by extreme weather events in both the North and South islands. \u201cDecisions we take now and in the future about everything from the places we live, to how we get around, to public health, to how we relate to one another will be impacted one way or another by climate change. It\u2019s crucial therefore that when we\u2019re making big decisions climate change is at the forefront of our minds,\u201d Shaw said in a statement. He said a \u2018climate impacts assessment\u2019 will be mandatory for proposals that are designed to reduce emissions, or which are likely to have an impact on greenhouse emissions greater than 250,000 tonnes a year. The Ministry for the Environment has developed a tool that can be used to estimate emissions impacts, and its effectiveness will be reviewed in mid-2020, Shaw said. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has called the climate emergency her generation\u2019s \u201cnuclear free moment\u201d and made tackling it a priority for her coalition government. Last month cabinet passed the zero-carbon bill, committing to reduce emission to net-zero by 2050. The government has also banned new offshore oil and gas exploration permits, committed to planting a billion trees by 2028, and told farmers to cut emissions by 2025 or face higher taxes. Greenpeace spokesperson Gen Toop welcomed the move but urged more action. \u201cWe really need to see more tangible policy action that will slash emissions now, especially those from the country\u2019s biggest emitter, agriculture,\u201d Toop said. \u201cWe need to cut emissions now. In order to do that the government must regulate industrial dairying by phasing out synthetic fertiliser use and capping cow numbers. It must support significant new wind and solar generation to power our homes, transport and economy, and it must cancel OMV\u2019s oil and gas exploration permits,\u201d Toop said, in reference to a fossil fuel company that has a permit to explore New Zealand\u2019s waters. The opposition climate change spokesperson, Scott Simpson, said the announcement was a \u201cwell-meaning initiative\u201d but how it was implemented would be the real test. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be another level of bureaucracy for decisions to go through,\u201d he said. The environment ministry said the effects of climate change were already being recorded in New Zealand, including sea-level rise, warming ocean temperatures and hotter summers. Longer-term, the ministry said the country will experience hotter annual temperatures nationwide, more severe weather, coastal erosion due to sea-level rise, increasingly frequent flooding and higher levels of human and animal mortality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
