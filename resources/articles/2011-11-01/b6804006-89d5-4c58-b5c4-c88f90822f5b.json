What happened at that selection meeting in the committee dining room at Lord's on the evening of 27 August 1968? How could they have omitted Basil D'Oliveira from the tour party to South Africa? We shall never know for sure. Only two men survive from that meeting, Doug Insole, who was chairman of selectors in 1968, and Donald Carr, who was the assistant secretary of the MCC at the time. Insole is greatly respected as a cricket administrator and a man, and has remained discreet over the years, as has Carr. Insole has always claimed the tour party was selected purely on cricketing merit. He remembers that, at the start of the meeting, he said: \"Let's forget about South Africa. Let's pick a team to go to Australia. And that's what we did.\" But how they all reached their conclusion we cannot tell. Peter Oborne acknowledges in his compelling book about D'Oliveira that \"far more is known about the cabinet meetings of Harold Wilson, or the activities of the secret service in Moscow, or the details of the Poseidon nuclear missile programme, than what the England selectors said and did that night.\" At least we have a good idea who was there: Insole and his fellow selectors, Peter May, Alec Bedser and Don Kenyon, who was D'Oliveira's captain at Worcestershire at the time. They were joined by Colin Cowdrey, the captain of England, plus key figures in the MCC establishment. The most influential of those was Gubby Allen, the MCC's treasurer; also present was the MCC president, AER Gilligan, who happened to be the uncle of May's wife. The MCC secretary, Billy Griffith, and Carr were in attendance; their role was administrative, but any notes taken by them have since been hard to come by. Oborne alleges in his book that South Africa's prime minister, John Vorster, had used \"secret pressure, bribery and blackmail\" to prevent D'Oliveira being chosen for that tour. He adds that the MCC, advised by the former Conservative prime minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, \"helped to make Vorster's life as easy as it could\". He details the machinations of the MCC and the South Africans. He contends that Allen withheld a letter from the South African Cricket Association from his committee because he reckoned it would compromise the chances of the tour going ahead. He explains how D'Oliveira was, in effect, offered a bribe to be unavailable for the tour by a South African businessman, operating at the behest of the South African government. He also puts forward the theory that Griffith and EW Swanton, the Daily Telegraph cricket correspondent, suggested to D'Oliveira that he should make himself available for South Africa rather than England. Moreover, he reckons that at least three of the men in the committee dining room on 27 August 1968 knew that the tour would not take place if D'Oliveira was selected. The cricketing argument against D'Oliveira is flimsy. It is based on the notion that his bowling might be ineffective in South Africa, especially if he was used as a third seamer. He was quite old; they thought he was 33 (in fact he was 36) and the selectors were aware that he had performed patchily on tour in the Caribbean, on and off the pitch. But he had just cracked that 158 against Australia at The Oval, which demonstrated beyond doubt that here was a cricketer with a superhuman temperament. Oborne surmises that none of the selectors spoke up for him \u2013 except Kenyon, the least influential of them \u2013 and that the man who could have swayed the meeting, Cowdrey, remained mysteriously silent. According to D'Oliveira in his autobiography, Cowdrey had told him beforehand: \"I want you in South Africa. If anyone at the tour selection meeting asks me if I am prepared to accept responsibility for anything that might happen on tour should you be selected, I shall say I am prepared to do so.\" It may well be that Cowdrey failed to be so forthright at the meeting. He was famously indecisive and always eager to remain within the cricketing establishment. Amazingly, D'Oliveira had no notice of his omission. In the Worcestershire dressing room, huddled around a transistor radio with his team-mates, he listened to the unmistakable voice of the BBC's cricket correspondent, Brian Johnston, who would always read out the names in alphabetical order. So when Johnston reached the name of JH Edrich there was the gradual realisation within that dressing room of what the selectors had decided. Tom Graveney recalled: \"Basil just fell apart. He put his head in his hands and wept.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
