The 40 year old Australian walked into the country's embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, on Tuesday and applied for protection from the European arrest warrant request citing the United Nations Human Rights Declaration. Last week the UK's supreme court finally rejected his appeal against extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning in connection with the alleged rape of one woman and sexual assault on another in August 2010. He had been given until 28 June to lodge an appeal against the UK court's decision at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. His lawyers were believed to be considering their next move. The WikiLeaks founder has been in custody and on bail in this country since autumn 2010. His bail conditions have varied over that time much for most of it they stipulated that he must stay at a country house in Suffolk owned by Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline club in west London, report to police daily and wear an electronic tag. Assange was granted bail on a surety of \u00a3240,000 raised and pledged by supporters. His apparent flight from the legal process could now place that money at risk of confiscation by the court. Assange's presence will focus attention on the extent of diplomatic immunity for foreign embassies in the UK. The Ecuadorian embassy issued a statement saying: \"This afternoon Mr Julian Assange arrived at the Ecuadorian embassy seeking political asylum from the Ecuadorian government. \"As a signatory to the United Nations Universal Declaration for Human Rights, with an obligation to review all applications for asylum, we have immediately passed his application on to the relevant department in Quito. \"While the department assesses Mr Assange's application, Mr Assange will remain at the embassy, under the protection of the Ecuadorian Government. \"The decision to consider Mr Assange's application for protective asylum should in no way be interpreted as the Government of Ecuador interfering in the judicial processes of either the United Kingdom or Sweden.\" The Ministry of Justice said that responsibility for handling his extradition rested with the Serious Organised crime Agency (SOCA) which deals with European Arrest Warrant requests. SOCA did not immediately reply to calls. Assange interviewed the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, on the Russia Today TV channel last month. In their exchange, the Australian explained that he had been under house arrest in England for 500 days and elicited sympathy from the left wing populist leader. By choosing Ecuador, he has alighted on a country that is clearly in accord with his political views, not closely aligned with the United States and, he will hope, beyond the reach of the European arrest warrant system. Some legal commentators have doubted whether Assange would have strong grounds to take his appeal to the ECHR in Strasbourg. He may have decided on his dramatic switch in tactics having been discouraged about his chances of success in Europe's highest court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
