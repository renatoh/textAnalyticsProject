Nearly 2.5m people watched the opening ceremony and the Australia v Argentina game, a record for a union match here. Perhaps more importantly, the figure is 140,000 more than watched the national rugby league (NRL) grand final the previous weekend. The NRL final has always been seen as the biggest event in Australia's rugby calendar. Knocking that game off its perch has long been a target for those in charge at the Australian Rugby Union. The century-old battle between the two codes has been bitterly rejoined in Australia in recent years, after rugby league was left in disarray by a bitter fight for control of the game between the media empires of Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer in the mid-1990s. Some experts now predict a dire future for league. \"Union should overtake league as the most popular rugby code some time next year,\" said Tim Honcoop, of the market research company Sweeney Sports. People visiting league's traditional heartlands of New South Wales and Queensland during the southern winter might be surprised by the notion that it is a game in decline, but behind the scenes a quiet revolution is taking place in union. More than 1.8m tickets have already been sold for the World Cup's 48 matches - three times more than for the first World Cup, hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 1987. Sweeney Sports' survey found that union was now just one percentage point behind league in terms of attendance figures, taking 15% of Australia's sports crowds compared with league's 16%. Both, however, are minnows next to Australian rules football, which swallows up 27% of all stadium seats. General interest in the codes has also seen union creeping closer to league. In 1988, 34% of Australians claimed to be league fans, against 15% backing union. League's share has crept up to 39% since then, but union's backing has soared to reach 37%. Regional loyalties are crucial to union's success, with the sport picking up new fans fastest away from league's eastern strongholds. In Adelaide and Perth, for example, TV audiences for the rugby league final barely topped 70,000, but the Australia-Argentina match drew more than 420,000 viewers. A quarter of the audience for that game was in Melbourne, the home of Australian rules football. \"I think we're in a good position to attract interest in Australian rules states,\" said David Pembroke, an adviser to Canberra's Brumbies union team. \"People are more receptive to a code that isn't rugby league.\" However, league loyalty will be hardest to erode in Sydney and Brisbane. The NRL final outstripped the Australia-Argentina match by 300,000 people in those cities, where more than 100,000 people who tuned in to watch the glitz of the World Cup opening ceremony promptly switched off when the national team waltzed on to the pitch. Despite all the fighting talk from rugby union, league fans remain confident that the World Cup will not dent interest in their sport. \"If you go to private schools you're brought up on rugby union, but it's just not relevant to anyone else in Australia,\" said Joshua Massoud, who wrote of being in an \"apathetic purgatory\" in a Sydney newspaper this week. \"It's the new golf. You take your corporate buddies to a box, do a deal and hardly watch the game at all.\" Claims of union's increased television profile may also be premature, especially as coverage of the Super-12 season was recently axed by terrestrial television, citing lack of viewer interest. Australia play Romania in Brisbane tomorrow. A comprehensive victory is expected but the real battle might be one for viewers, with the national league team in simultaneous action against New Zealand in Auckland. Preparing for that game the Kangaroos coach, Chris Anderson, was scathing about union. \"From what I've seen of the rah-rahs we haven't got a lot to beat,\" he said. \"It would be nice to get a game where there's not 100 points scored.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
