Rampling plays Ellen, a regular visitor to a beach resort where the fall-out of the 'Baby Doc' Duvalier regime has made disposable, destitute gigolos of the island's 'beautiful boys'. Ellen claims handsome Legba (Menothy Cesar) as her own, but the arrival of Brenda (Karen Young), with her naive dreams of romantic love, threatens to topple the dominance of her market force. Adapted from the writings of Danny Laferriere, who cites 'sexuality as an instrument of political, social or economic power' as his prime concern, this is earnest, somewhat overwrought stuff from acclaimed director Laurent Cantet. Like its leading ladies, the film is rich, cultured and slightly tiresome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
