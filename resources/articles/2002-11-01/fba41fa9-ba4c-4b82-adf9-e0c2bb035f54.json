Advent calendars are standard now - although the Germans still do them better - but then they had an exotic rarity that the Christmas markets of Continental Europe still hold. My first taste of Continental Christmas shopping was during the three-day-week winter of 1973. British shops were grim and empty. I had never heard of Christmas markets and discovered the one in Aachen's market almost by accident, following the scent of sausages. The joy of lighted shops, music and fairytale carved toys was like getting childhood back. All continental countries have traditional Christmas markets, and in Cologne, Bruges, Copenhagen, Calais, Rome and Barcelona, you can happily wallow in Christmas spirit. By crossing the Channel you can get off-beat presents, especially the difficult ones for great aunts and one's children's inlaws. Our delicacies are ordinary and cheaper there. And you can have a bit of relaxing fun, a walk on a stony beach or in an ancient forest in the snow. Britain Christmas markets are catching on in Britain. Leicester, Melton Mowbray and Lincoln are already well established. Cities where the ethnic minorities have moved into traditional markets, such as London, Manchester and Bradford, all mix Brussels sprouts with exotic foods. This weekend, Bath is holding its first Christmas market. Other places - council websites bristle with them - offer Father Christmas, carols and craft fairs. Try towns with livestock auctions of geese and turkeys, but none of them have the pagan feel of the Continental markets. Jersey's festival, the F\u00eate De Nou\u00e9, which ends on Monday in St Helier, promises carol singers, music, mulled wine and mince pies, plus VAT-free shopping. Frankfurt comes to Birmingham this weekend, with hand-made decorations, wooden toys, candles, marzipan and gl\u00fchwein at a replica of the German city's market. Manchester's Albert Square holds three Christmas markets: this weekend (specialising in British food and crafts), then December 7-9 and 14-16. Birmingham's Christmas market is in Martineau Place, Victoria Square, until December 21. The Frankfurt Youth choir sings today at 3pm.
