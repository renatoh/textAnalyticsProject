Anthony McGrath, belatedly given the earlier offerings, was finally given the ball late in the evening session and in only his second over bowled Kirsten off the inside edge. Until then it seemed, just as it had on the opening day of the series, as if South Africa would bat through a complete day without losing a wicket. Kirsten, nine overnight and a thorn in England's side over the years, had survived a chance to Mark Butcher at second slip when 54 and went on to reach 108, his 17th Test hundred. Innings such as this from him are rarely memorable but of immense value. It was small beer, though, as South Africa's remarkable captain, without letting up, became the first from his country to score double centuries in successive Tests. By the time the poor light that had prevailed all day got gloomier and took the players from the field with 18 overs remaining, Smith had reached 214, taking his aggregate for the series to 576 with his third innings not yet done. No one has made more runs in a series than Don Bradman, who in 1930 in England amassed 974 in five Tests. Given a fair wind, Smith can cruise past that now, although if the rest of his batsmen perform he may not get another knock in this match. There is, though, the potential for other great deeds, for this is not a man who celebrates the occasion and then gets out. Four times now in his brief career (of the players in this match, only James Anderson is younger) he has reached a Test century and only once, when Pakistan dismissed him for a paltry 151, has he failed to convert it into a double. It is a quite staggering achievement. Only two days of this match have gone, and the weekend weather is set fair. If he can carry on today there is ample scope to eclipse not only his own South African record score of 277, made in the previous Test, but to go past 300, then Graham Gooch's Lord's record of 333 and beyond that, who knows, Brian Lara and history? If that doesn't get him out now, nothing will. South Africa, on 412 for two, have already established a lead of 239, which given the quality of the pitch (or at least that evidenced when the visitors have been batting on it) ought not to be sufficient to win yet. But given the circumstances - not least the remarkable change in fortune since Michael Vaughan's one-day side hammered the South Africans in the final on this ground a few weeks ago - it is almost inconceivable that, if they push on to 600 and beyond, England can recover their equilibrium sufficiently to save the Test as they managed, with some help from the weather, to do in Birmingham. Has any leader ever made such an impact at the start of a series? Leading from the front is one thing, but this has just been astounding from Smith. England have had little answer to him, neither to subdue nor dismiss. They have bowled to his strength, allowing him to score prolifically through the on side as a strong bottom-hand grip shuts the blade on the bat and drags the ball round, and they have fed him outside off stump from back of a length where he has been able to force the ball away. Occasionally, during the 7 hours he has been at the crease, he has driven, sometimes through extra cover but more likely straight, as when he belted Andy Flintoff back past the bowler and greeted the start of a spell by Jimmy Anderson in the same manner. In all he has hit 29 fours, making a series total of 74 in addition to two sixes. For Vaughan and his side there was the opportunity for redemption after the tribulations of the first day, and the chance perhaps to digest the events that have so disrupted their week. They could not have had better help from the weather, which had brought rain overnight and into the morning so that play did not begin until midday, and which remained misty and mizzly throughout. Bowlers should have thrived, and a feeling pervaded that Shaun Pollock would have rolled up his sleeves and wrought havoc. Yet again, though, England had the resource neither to place batsmen under pressure attritionally (one four-over spell involving Flintoff and Darren Gough, who may be sensing the end is nigh, during a period where Smith went 15 overs without a boundary, was as good as it got), nor to bowl the sort of deliveries that can dismiss top players on good surfaces. Scarcely anything beat the bat; no appeal, not even a squeak, came until late into the final session. The only chance came when Kirsten flirted outside off stump at Flintoff, who was persevering as ever, and edged to Butcher. It came at that awkward height, however - somewhere below the sternum and dead straight - where the fielder cannot decide, in the split second afforded him, whether to take the ball fingers-up or fingers-down, with no chance either to let the ball ride in his hands as it would had it gone to either side. The ball cannoned into his chest, bounced forward and eluded the fielder's flailing dive. In the end it was McGrath who showed much of the bowling up. In his last bowl in a Test, against Zimbabwe on this ground back in May, he took three for 16. Yesterday, from the start of his brief five-over spell, he wobbled the ball around, finally induced the edge from Kirsten and came extremely close to claiming Boeta Dippenaar with a ball that swung away so much it was actually missing off stump. If Vaughan had 10 lieutenants out there it is telling that no one, not even McGrath himself, had come up with this option earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
