What\u2019s not to like?", "bodyText": "\u2022 Will there be a resounding silence in September at the World Nuclear Association symposium and exhibition in Central Hall, Westminster? The world\u2019s nuclear industries will be strutting their stuff: 700 business and leaders from 30 countries discussing such issues as the fuel cycle front-end (no, me neither), the security of nuclear fuel supplies, financing new builds, and uranium resources. There will be a reception at Westminster Abbey and a gala dinner at the Natural History Museum. And, to crown it all, a discussion panel. That is due to feature Alexander Lokshin, deputy director general of Rosatom, the organisation that controls Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons companies, research institutes and safety agencies; and Lyudmila Zalimskaya of Tenex, which exports the country\u2019s nuclear materials, such as enriched uranium, and is big in the Emirates and China. So far 34 Russian delegates have booked (last year there were 70), but it\u2019s early days. \u201cWe have not been told that they will not be allowed to come,\u201d says an organiser. So, business as usual. Maybe. \u2022 Belated diary hats off to Emily Benn, Tony\u2019s granddaughter and at 24 the fifth generation of the family to stand for parliament \u2013 after recently being selected as Labour\u2019s candidate for Croydon South next year after unaccountably failing to dent the Tory majority in Worthing at the last election, when she was 20. Rejoicing too for her is New College Oxford, where she is an alumna, following in granddad\u2019s footsteps there too. The family\u2019s famous courtesy stretches down as well: she tells the Daily Telegraph that she found the denizens of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford mostly respectful and polite. It was the men attending the university\u2019s political societies who were unregenerate and lewd \u2013 and they will probably be the ones she\u2019ll have to deal with when she finally gets to Westminster. \u2022 Slightly further north of the dreaming spires, residents of Farndon Road in the city\u2019s most affluent suburb are breaking out the prosecco at a planning victory against tour operator and multimillionaire Craig Burkinshaw. He bought two of the large Victorian villas there and wanted to emulate the plutocrats of Kensington by burrowing down to hollow out a swimming pool. It has been a long battle but a planning inspector has given them game, set and match: \u201cQuite extraordinary over-development\u201d and \u201cin virtually every regard a step too far\u201d. Burkinshaw\u2019s Audley Travel specialises in exotic holidays to distant locations, but he has discovered trouble closer to home. \u2022 The football season approaches, and across the land players are rubbing dubbin in their boots in preparation. (Do they still do that?) Hot transfer news therefore in the East Kent Mercury of non-league Dover\u2019s signing of midfielder Nicky Deverdics, currently playing for \u201ctop flight club\u201d TB Tv\u00f8royri in the Faroe Islands. The big time beckons at the Crabble: watch out Colchester United there on Friday night. \u2022 The Catholic church has a way of dealing with schismatics, but today there\u2019s news of a schism within a schism. The Tablet brings news that Holocaust-denying Bishop Richard Williamson, having split from the arch-conservative Society of St Pius X (they were getting a bit too liberal) has set up on his own in the French Loire. Williamson, a British former schoolmaster whose excommunication from the main Catholic church was briefly lifted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, now thinks the Vatican is in the power of Satan. He does not believe women should wear trousers or go to university, still reckons Jews are the enemies of Christ, and says, heretically, that the Sound of Music is \u201csoul-rotting slush\u201d. It may therefore be quite a select group attending his masses. \u2022 Finally, on a more elevated level, courtesy of the BBC\u2019s favourite cleric, the Rev Richard Coles, Thursday was the feast day of Christina the Astonishing, a 12th-century Belgian saint who could fly and occasionally lived in holes, ovens and ponds while preaching. She sounds rather exhausting, if not tiresome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
