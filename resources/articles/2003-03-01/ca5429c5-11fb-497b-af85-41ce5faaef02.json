Although it continues to peddle the myth that the development was started by Linus Torvalds, it also notes the ongoing transition of GNU/Linux from a grass roots movement to a corporate operating system peddled mainly by IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other industrial giants, to whom the cost of the operating system is trivial compared to the hardware with which it is bundled. (And yes, it does represent a much better deal for users than being tied into a proprietary operating system or a vendor-dependent flavour of Unix.) It will also be interesting to see whether this sort of serious Linux coverage marks a change at BWO, which too often tends to come across like an Apple fanzine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
