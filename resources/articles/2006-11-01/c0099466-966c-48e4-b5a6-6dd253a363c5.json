Anything that tries to get more people into teaching, and presents it as a positive profession, which it is, is a good idea. For science, I'd definitely choose David Attenborough. The reason I'm a science teacher now is because of David Attenborough, he's got that enthusiasm and excitement and he can make any subject in science seem interesting. He's also used to dealing with wild creatures and that would be useful, too. The problem would be that when I got back I'd get lots of \"Please sir, why can't we have Mr Attenborough again, he was great and didn't set us any homework\". For drama, which is the other subject I teach, I'd choose Helen Mirren. She could teach them an awful lot about drama. Tomas Mackay Aged 13, Bristol Stephen Fry, because I think he'd be a really interesting person just to talk to and for him to teach me, that would be even better. Jamie Oliver, because I think he's got a lot of personality and I'd love him to teach me how to cook something. Adam Hart-Davis for history, he's very knowledgeable and he makes history fun, as well. Bill Bailey for music, I've seen him on Never Mind the Buzzcocks and I've seen him do some stand-up as well. Good teachers have to have knowledge, but they have to have a spark, some personality, too. Boris Johnson, who went into a London school last week, might be quite good; I don't know too much about him but he seems like quite a nice guy. Sarah Willans Parent, Devon For music, Eliza Carthy, an electrifying young musician whose enthusiasm for English folk music is contagious. If anyone can make our children proud of their musical heritage, she can. For English, the poet Don Paterson. He has referred to poetry as a \"dark art\" connecting straight to the subconscious, and spoken up for risk-taking and passion among poets. For history, someone who is or was prepared to die to change it, so perhaps Emmeline Pankhurst. She was known as a charismatic speaker, and I don't think she'd have any trouble with a class of teenagers. French, the great French singer/songwriter Georges Brassens, with his funny and sometimes quite rude songs. I think the kids would love them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
