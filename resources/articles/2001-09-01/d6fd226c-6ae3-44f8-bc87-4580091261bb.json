Knocked out of the Champions League there by Valencia last season, Arsene Wenger's team made the worst possible start to their new campaign last night when they had Ashley Cole sent off and lost to Real Mallorca. Matches without red cards and controversy seem impossible for Arsenal at present. Not one of their five games this season has ended with 22 players and Cole's early dismissal gave Mallorca a victory which would have been heavier but for David Seaman. The left-back's clumsy 11th-minute tackle provided Mallorca with the penalty that decided the game and, though Thierry Henry might have had a penalty in the second half, Arsenal rarely threatened until the substitute Francis Jeffers wasted a late chance. Wenger, not surprisingly, saw Cole's red card, the 36th of his reign, as \"very harsh\". \"I believe he could have given a penalty,\" he said. \"He went for the ball and to be sent off like that is very difficult to accept.\" Yet Cole was the last man when he fouled Alberto Luque as the lively striker shaped to shoot, and the 20-year-old could have few complaints. He will miss the game at home to Schalke next Wednesday. Playing a man down against pacy, disciplined and technically adroit opponents was always likely to be tough. Mallorca repeatedly threatened down the flanks and it was as well that Seaman, so impressive in recent matches for England, again looked closer to 18 than the 38th birthday he will celebrate this month. Three saves in particular caught the eye and Wenger paid tribute. \"He could have done more for us and saved the penalty,\" the Frenchman said, tongue in cheek. \"Then it would have been a perfect game from him. Apart from that he was outstanding.\" Seaman's opposite number Leo Franco made only one notable stop, a comfortable one from Sylvain Wiltord. Until their late pressure Arsenal had struggled to hold possession against hard-working opponents who were willing to pull men behind the ball and they rarely looked threatening on the counter-attack. Jeffers added menace but wasted a clear opportunity, shooting over from a free-kick by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who filled in at left-back after Cole's dismissal. Earlier Henry seemed to deserve better than to be booked for diving when he fell under a tackle by Miguel Nadal in the area. \"It looked from the touchline as if he had been touched,\" said Wenger, who was not best pleased with the decisions of the Danish referee Knud Erik Fisker. \"I don't think the referee's decisions were in our favour tonight.\" Before the start a minute's silence was held as a mark of respect for the terrorist victims in the United States. Uefa had requested that and is to make a statement today about whether tonight's and tomorrow night's European ties will go ahead as planned. \"We will continue to closely monitor security developments within Europe,\" said Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner. Wenger said everyone at Arsenal was \"aware\" of the tragedy but focused on the match. There was talk of last night's fixtures being postponed but a Uefa spokesman said those clubs who had been in touch had wanted the matches to be played. \"Fans are arriving at grounds and arrangements are in place,\" said Uefa's director of communications Mike Lee. \"It is safer to go ahead.\" This was Mallorca's first appearance in the Champions League and the atmosphere reached fever pitch when Cole fouled Luque and the influential Vicente Engonga chipped in the penalty. It required Seaman's reflexes to keep out Engonga and Luque twice before half-time and the keeper made another good stop from a Fernando Nino header after the interval. Mallorca faded as the game wore on but still carried a threat on the counter and when Jeffers shot over and failed to reach a late cross by Ray Parlour, Arsenal knew it would not be their night. Real Mallorca (4-4-2): Leo Franco; Olaizola, Nadal, Nino, Miquel Soler; Campano, Marcos, Engonga (Vicente, 67min), Ibagaza (Novo, 44); Luque (Paunovic, 76), Eto'o. Arsenal (4-4-2): Seaman; Lauren, Keown, Campbell, Cole; Pires (Parlour, 76), Vieira, Van Bronckhorst, Ljungberg (Jeffers, 71); Wiltord (Kanu, 71), Henry. Referee: K Fisker (Denmark). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
