In many regions of what used to be the old western empires, parties that trace their descent from liberation movements enjoy a pre-eminence that is both natural and unnatural. Natural, because gratitude and respect for those who fought and sacrificed has a long half-life, and because those who take power in the immediate aftermath of liberation have huge advantages over those who try to enter politics at a later stage. Unnatural, because a party system allowing for alternation in government struggles to emerge in these circumstances. Three very different election campaigns in recent months illustrate this problem. In South Africa, where voters go to the polls on Wednesday, there is widespread discontent over unemployment, corruption, the distribution of land, and the persistence of poverty. But there is not the slightest prospect that the African National Congress will lose the election, only the possibility that its majority will be reduced. Even if the opposition parties do well, it would still be a long hard climb to reach a point, perhaps two or three elections from now, at which the ANC might actually be displaced. And this is the case even though a significant number of voters belong to the \"born free\" generation, which has no memory of apartheid and only a limited grasp of the sufferings of those who opposed it. In Algeria, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, ailing but ruthless, was re-elected for another five years last month after a campaign in which he was all but invisible. The inheritors of liberation in Algeria are not so much a dominant party \u2013 there is one, but it has been through various vicissitudes \u2013 as a group of mainly military figures Algerians call \"le pouvoir\". They are indeed the power behind the scenes in a stage-managed parody of democracy that makes a mockery of what Algerians fought for a half century ago. If South Africa is a young democracy that needs to get out of the liberation trap and Algeria an oligarchy caught in the trap, India is a mature democracy breaking out of it. Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata party may not do as well in the elections that end this weekend as has been predicted, but Congress rule is no longer the default mode of Indian politics. What is arriving instead, as Mr Modi may find, is a country where local politics will often trump national politics of whatever colour, a difficult type of democracy but one which would reflect India's diversity. What these different trajectories demonstrate, as they do in other countries, is that liberation is a god that nations worship at their peril. If real politics is to emerge, there has to be a liberation from liberation itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
