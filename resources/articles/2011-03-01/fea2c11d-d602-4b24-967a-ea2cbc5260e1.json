Moody! Misunderstood!", "bodyText": "If ever a woman was at risk of being reduced to her body parts, it was that star of the 1940s and 1950s, Jane Russell, who was initially subject to a level of objectification as relentless as it was breathtaking. Russell died on Monday at the age of 89. She was born in Minnesota, brought up in southern California, and broke into the film industry in her late teens. An apocryphal Hollywood story had her discovered by eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes while working as a dentist's receptionist, but the reality was slightly less boom-bang: accompanying a friend to a photographer's studio in 1940, she was spotted by an agent who passed on pictures of her to director Howard Hawks. She was immediately cast in her first film, The Outlaw. The western was being produced by Hughes; he eventually took over from Hawks as its director. By the time of its release in 1943, Hughes was determined to extract the maximum publicity from Russell's cruel mouth, defiant sexuality, and above all, her eye-popping figure. The most famous still from the film has her lying in the hay, glaring into the camera, dress wrested from her shoulders. \"How'd you like to tussle with Russell?\" read one advertisement for the film. \"Mean! Moody! Magnificent!\" read another. \"What are the two reasons for Jane Russell's rise to stardom?\" asked Hughes, almost certainly, one imagines, while winking and holding his fingers like pistols. In time, to ensure audiences hadn't missed the point, a skywriter was hired to zip and zoom through the blue, spelling out The Outlaw, before looping two large circles beneath it, a dot in the middle of each. The censors were unimpressed, even after 37 scenes of Russell were excised, and the film was pulled quickly from its limited release. In court, a judge said Russell's breasts \"hung over the picture like a thunderstorm over a landscape. They were everywhere.\" Hughes sent Russell out on a publicity drive while planning his next move, and she became a favourite of the armed forces, voted the most popular female star in the country before the vast majority of people had ever seen her act. When The Outlaw finally secured a wider release in 1946, it was largely panned, but Russell \u2013 damned by one critic as \"the queen of motionless pictures\" \u2013 was established. The problem was that she was established as simply a smouldering sexpot, and remained subject to wearisome tributes and jokes alike. A pair of embattled hills in Korea were named after her by US troops. Bob Hope, her co-star in the successful 1948 comedy The Paleface, in which she played a spoofish version of Calamity Jane, introduced her as \"the two and only Jane Russell\", and quipped \"culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands\". But thankfully Russell had talent and style enough to save her, wryness and coolness to burn, the wit to transcend all the nudging winks. In her most famous film, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, released in 1953 \u2013 which was also her personal favourite \u2013 she gave a performance to justify the film critic David Thomson's admiring verdict decades later that \"such droll eroticism is rare in Hollywood\". In that film, Russell's character, Dorothy Shaw, is set up in direct opposition to the character of her best friend, Lorelei Lee, played by Marilyn Monroe. Where Lorelei is all baby voice and imploring, flashing eyes, desperate to marry a rich man, Dorothy is exactly the opposite. She is smart where Lorelei is brainless; grown-up where Lorelei is juvenile; wisecracking where Lorelei is breathy; straightforward where Lorelei is dissembling. She doesn't care for diamonds, but she does care for her own desires. The pair set sail from the US to Paris and, early on, Russell performs one of the film's most memorable numbers, Ain't There Anyone Here for Love? Singing in a gymnasium, she is joined by muscular actors playing the US Olympic team, who form a distinctive \u2013 and distinctively subversive \u2013 Busby Berkeley chorus around her. \"I like big muscles, and red corpuscles,\" she croons, eyes widening happily as an enormous bicep pops right in front of her eyes, a woman clearly in control of her own sexuality. This performance was a gift to women, a much-needed counterpoint to Monroe's entertaining but ultimately diminishing turn as Lorelei. It should have seen Russell become the queen of Hollywood, but while she continued to make films, she never really won the kind of material worthy of her gifts. (Her next film, the musical The French Line, was publicised: \"JR in 3D. Need we say more?\" To which the answer is a sighing: \"Please don't.\") Russell had largely given up acting by the end of the 1950s. Asked once why she quit, she replied: \"Because I was getting old! You couldn't go on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30, honey.\" She continued to have an interesting, complicated life outside the industry, working tirelessly to promote adoption. She had had a botched backstreet abortion herself, at 18, and was unable to have children of her own, so she adopted three with her first husband, and founded the World Adoption International Fund. This mission won her the praise of feminist groups - but her anti-abortion stance didn't. Russell was a born-again Christian, a one-time alcoholic and a dedicated Republican who, in a late interview, would go so far as to describe herself as \"a teetotal, mean-spirited, rightwing, narrow-minded, conservative Christian bigot, but not a racist\". (Her explanation that, to her, bigotry \"just means you don't have an open mind\", softened this only a tiny amount.) Such views meant she could never be an obvious feminist icon offscreen, but in her best-known work, her most inspired turn, the film that will outlive us all, she is just that. She is one of those rare actors \u2013 objectified in their youth into almost-inevitable obsolescence \u2013 who managed to rise proudly, brilliantly, above all that, in one perfect, incendiary performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
