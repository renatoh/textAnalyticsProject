Judging by the disappearance of the term from newspaper headlines, it may be passing into history. Of course \"pockets of deprivation\", of crime, unemployment, poor education and housing still persist amid general prosperity. But 30 years ago the term inner city meant something more. It meant the Other England, a place of suppressed creative energy expressed through a succession of subcultures and street events such as the Notting Hill carnival. Compared with the neat suburbs, inner cities were free spaces. The trade unions may have controlled the workplaces but not the communities where their members lived. In places such as Ladbroke Grove, in west London, working-class residents were joined by students, artists and dropouts looking for cheap rented accommodation or empty properties to squat. These new narodniki included some of the best minds of my generation. Newsreader and journalist Jon Snow; future ministers and MPs, including Peter Mandelson, Hilary Armstrong, Simon Hughes, Alun Michael and Alan Simpson; and media moguls such as Greg Dyke - not to mention numerous academics - cut their teeth as youth and community workers, or taught in the local comprehensive. They set up adventure playgrounds, street festivals and a host of grassroots community organisations. I myself helped to occupy a disused pub on a tough estate in south Islington and turn it into a youth centre. Move to the right Then came the inevitable disillusionment. During the 1970s some white youth, the skinheads, converged around the National Front while their parents belied their reputation for sheep-like support for Labour and voted for the far right. Community activists responded with prescriptions such as Rock Against Racism and Kick Racism Out of Football. The swing to the right may also have been a reaction against these \"long-haired, middle-class, sandal-wearing do-gooders\", as Charlie Goodman, a lifelong veteran of tenants' organisations in east London, once put it. In the 80s, with the departure of the white working classes, \"inner city\" became a euphemism for urban ghetto. It carried a racial connotation. Black and ethnic minority people were being walled in by institutional racism. Throughout the 80s a series of uprisings took place, with black people at the forefront, in Toxteth, Brixton, Peckham, Blackbird Leys, Handsworth, Moss Side, Broadwater Farm and St Pauls. It was mainly directed at the police and their heavy-handed tactics. But the real pressure came from the demoralising effect of unemployment. The Scarman report into the Brixton riots, published in 1981, heralded the arrival of the multicultural agenda - from racial awareness training for police officers to a plethora of glitzy economic initiatives such as City Challenge designed in Margaret Thatcher's words to \"win back\" the inner cities. But it was not only institutional racism that was keeping the ghetto people in their place. As in the US, community workers were losing out to gangsters seeking to make big money through the drug economy. During the 90s I returned to the neighbourhoods where I had lived, but now I was representing a grant-giving charity. Disillusionment with radical solutions was widespread. For a new generation of policy makers, \"inner city\" was less about unleashing the creative potential of working people and more about the management of risk. That required a combination of new administrative thinking and racially sensitive policing. All of this was to be funded by the government through positive sounding initiatives such as the New Deal for Communities, Neighbourhood Renewal and the Single Regeneration Budget. The talk was of empowerment and of establishing neighbourhood forums the better to reflect the views of the community. A plethora of New Labour initiatives has followed, aimed at the management of \"at risk\" groups: neighbourhood wardens, police community support officers, antisocial behaviour orders, and reforms of housing management intended to drive out racists and other \"neighbours from hell\" and give tenants a greater say over what goes on next door. Today, in mixed neighbourhoods like Kentish Town in north London, where I live, gentrification continues to push up house prices. In the outer suburbs dominated by high-rise public housing, the gentrification process is mirrored where tenants have exercised the right to buy. The youth training workshop I worked in was closed recently and the site sold off by the council. The estate agents christened it the \"artisans quarter\" and advertised \"artisans dwellings\" from \u00a3300,000. For young professionals, an inner city is a place where you can move in and express yourself by completely redesigning an old property. But gentrification never displaces everyone. Your neighbours are likely to include pensioners subsisting on state benefits, refugee families struggling to cope, as well as people who have always lived in the area and have never worked. A land with no fathers But the inner city is also the place where the drugs trade has made neighbourhoods more violent places, where the first law of the street is to lie and to maintain an alert paranoid vigilance in a threatening environment, where there is widespread carrying and use of weapons to settle often trivial disputes. It is also a land without fathers, of young men growing up with little idea of what it means to be a responsible adult. Traditional West Indian and Bengali cultures, for example, are cultures of seniority. But young men are growing up angry with their absent fathers. My own view of the inner city has changed from 40 years ago. I've not become a reactionary. It is more that my personal circumstances have changed dramatically. I am not the same person who worked in a training workshop for boys just out of borstal, or occupied an old pub on a housing estate in Islington. Indeed as a middle-aged homeowner with a family there are times when I don't recognise that person at all. Building a free life in the inner city has been replaced by more achievable goals, such as obtaining funding for the local youth club. Inner cities feel less free and vibrant places than they were before. The \"do your own thing\" ethos of the new narodniki of the 70s with their street festivals and free neighbourhood newssheets has gone. There are codes of practice for community development work, and something called PC, standing for policy creep, where the overriding goal of the government to manage and control poor people can stifle attempts at creative local solutions. Meanwhile, the places we called inner cities are on the move. In Kentish Town, organic food stores and gastropubs supplant greasy spoons and the Victorian workers' beer halls. There's also a community cafe, a favoured haunt for Somali and other Arabic speaking young men from the surrounding estates. Some are poorly educated and marginalised, others are filled with idealism and radicalism to serve their community. The cafe is called Ha Idhaafin - meaning don't pass me by. \u00b7 David Robins's books include Knuckle Sandwich (Penguin), We Hate Humans (Penguin), Tarnished Vision: crime and conflict in the inner city (OUP) and Cool Rules (with Dick Pountain) (Reaction)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
