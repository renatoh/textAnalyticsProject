According to a poll last week, 60 per cent want troops out by the end of the year, while 40 per cent want them out immediately. That looks unlikely with the current incumbents in Downing Street and the White House. But a year from now, Tony Blair will not be Prime Minister and George W Bush will be a lame-duck President. The will for war that was embodied in those two men will be depleted, perhaps gone. And Iraq? That is harder to predict, but a safe bet is that it will not be the flourishing democracy envisaged when the invasion was launched. A best-case scenario has it subsisting as a unitary state, its fledgling democratic institutions still standing and gaining confidence, its security forces less corrupt and less open to infiltration by sectarian militias, the shadow of indiscriminate terror receding. There is much speculation ahead about Iraq's future and arguments to be had over the mistakes of the last three years. But the question that urgently needs an answer is simple: does our continued military presence make it more or less likely that the relatively positive scenario outlined above will come to pass? Britain made a commitment to the people of Iraq to turn tyranny to democracy. So there are only two reasons why we might leave. First, if we think that by staying we are actually making it harder for Iraq's elected government to guarantee its people security. Second, if we believe we have failed irredeemably in our mission and might as well leave the Iraqis to sort out their problems for themselves. To argue that we are only making things worse sits ill with the wish of the Iraqi government that we stay. It is true that foreign troops will be a target for insurgents and al-Qaeda as long as they are on Iraqi soil. It is also true that many Iraqis who at first welcomed liberation from Saddam Hussein later turned against what they came to see as an occupation. But the majority of the violence and the greatest threat to Iraqi civilians now comes from sectarian fighting between Sunni and Shia and among Shia factions sporting various shades of fundamentalism. The job for coalition forces is to support the efforts of the Iraqi government and the Iraqi national army in halting the slide into civil war. If there is hope that our support is making a positive difference, it must be given unstintingly. The current climate of pessimism, bordering on panic, takes the short-term view that Iraqi democracy cannot be salvaged. It still can. That doesn't mean there may never be a day when underpinning the Iraqi government is futile, when the war is truly lost and it is time to retreat, beaten and humiliated. That is the risk of staying. But the consequences of calling that moment now are worse. It would turn the prospect of murderous chaos, the rise of brutal theocracy and massive regional destabilisation from a risk to a certainty. Tactical retreat from Iraq is sometimes argued on the grounds that redeployment to Afghanistan is all that is needed to eliminate the Taliban. It isn't that simple. There is no immediate prospect in either of the two campaigns of a big triumphal moment - an unconditional surrender of forces hostile to Britain. At best, there can only be incremental progress. Even if achieved, that offers no political reward on the home front. It will become ever more electorally expedient to bring troops home, whatever the long-term hope for Iraq. That will happen faster across the Atlantic. Iraq has been the biggest campaign issue in congressional elections due next month and voters look ready to punish the Republican party for George W Bush's handling of the war. One consequence could be a lapse into the default US foreign policy position - isolating itself, using its power abroad sparingly, defining its self-interests in the narrowest terms as prosperity and security within its own borders. London must use its influence in Washington, limited but not inconsequential, to lobby against American retreat into a continental fortress. Alone, Britain cannot carry the idea that foreign policy should include humanitarian intervention abroad. Before Iraq, before 11 September, there was Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Kosovo. They were not perfect operations, but they were better choices than doing nothing. We must be realistic about what can be achieved in the Middle East. But realism must not give way to cynicism. There will still be times when democracies must intervene in the affairs of dictatorships, by force if necessary, not just to defend their own interests, but also because they are morally obliged to do so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
