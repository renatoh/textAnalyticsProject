It was in 1969 that I first visited the unique Melnikov family home in central Moscow, near the Arbat, designed by Konstantin and met the architect and his son. Konstantin, his vigorous architecture rejected from the 1930s onwards, had obtained official permission in 1927 to embark on the construction of that house. Designed in the form of two interlocking cylinders one slightly higher than the other resulting in oddly shaped rooms, it is a striking and exciting example of the best in the 1920s avant-garde. Konstantin avoided sharp right angles as much as possible, preferring round and angled forms. Victor's mother, however, was fond of net curtains and old fashioned heavy furniture which, still in situ, look bizarre in the ultra modern house. There is even an icon corner with a little curtain drawn over the holy image. The walls are pierced by hexagonal windows that are placed regularly throughout the facade and can be hidden or revealed as desired providing uniform illumination. Above the huge studio at the front with its floor to ceiling glazing are the words \"Konstantin Melnikov, Arkhitektor\". Caring for the famous house has occupied much of Victor's time and energy ever since his father died in 1974. He bombarded the Soviet, and then the Russian authorities, to have the house properly repaired and taken over by the government as a museum to his father and repository of his archive. Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the communist government remained indifferent, unwilling to praise an architect publicly denounced, not only in the 1930s but also by the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the 1960s. After the Soviet Union was no more, new interests rose to claim the valuable central Moscow property. First Victor's sister, Lyudmila, laid claim to it. After many years the dispute finally came to court and Lyudmila lost her case. She has since died, but her son took up the cudgel together with the younger of Victor's daughters, Yelena. Last year the acrimonious court case was decided in Victor's favour. Saddest of all, only a few hours after his death his daughter, Yelena, and her cousin appeared with armed guards and lawyers intent on taking over the house. Victor's eldest daughter, Yekaterina, managed to stop the illegal entry but the case is again to go to court. In Victor's will, the house is to be given to the Russian state and Yekaterina is to be the executor. It seems the Shchusev Museum of Architecture, before his death, had already embarked on the difficult process of documenting the enormous archive that is scattered in piles all over the house. When Victor was born his father was a 25-year-old architectural student. In 1917, the year of revolution, Konstantin graduated and received his first commission, the neo-classical facade of Moscow's first automobile factory, the AMO, later, the Likhachev works. Victor recalled as a young boy the thrill of his father becoming one of the principal architects of the new Soviet regime. His designs were encouraged in the 1920s when the members of the Russian avant-garde were briefly free to indulge their imagination. Konstantin designed and built five workers' clubs and his universally praised design was chosen for the Soviet pavilion at the 1925 Paris International Exposition of Decorative Arts and won the Grand Prix. Victor, aged 10, accompanied his parents to Paris. He often recalled his impressions of France - he enrolled at a school in Chartres - and of the high esteem in which his parents, dressed in the latest Parisian fashions, were held there. He never forgot his French and years later could still write it fluently. Victor's career closely mirrored that of his father. He studied at the Moscow Technical School of Decorative Arts, and then concentrated on painting at the State Art Institute, graduating in 1942. But after the rise of Stalin his father's work was heavily criticised and after 1937 Konstantin, although he submitted brilliant designs never received another commission. Victor suffered in parallel fashion. He was allowed to become a member of the official Moscow Artists Union, but his paintings were unacceptable to the authorities and he made a living by making copies of the work of other Russian artists. Meanwhile he refined his early dreamy style of portraying light with barely a hint of form and colour. Unable to have his paintings exhibited publicly, in 1971 friends staged his first solo exhibition privately in a studio. George Costakis, the great collector of the Russian avant-garde art who visited the exhibition, wrote: \"Melnikov has revealed a new world. These are not landscapes, they are icons of the new mysterious religion.\" Until recently, when his sight began to fade, Victor remained in good health. Well into his 80s he would surprise guests by performing energetic chin-ups on the doorframe of the Melnikov house when saying goodbye. In 1990, marking the 100th anniversary of Konstantin's birth and of Victor's 75th birthday, a large exhibition of father and son was held in the Central House of Artists. Victor married Irina Georgievna Pavlova, but the marriage did not last and in the 1970s he moved back into his parents' home. Perhaps now the Melnikovs' extraordinary cylindrical house will be saved for the Russian nation. It would be a suitable memorial not only for the greatest of the avant-garde architects of the 1920s, but also for his remarkable son. Victor's daughters survive him. \u00b7 Victor Melnikov, artist born December 28 1914; died February 5 2006"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
