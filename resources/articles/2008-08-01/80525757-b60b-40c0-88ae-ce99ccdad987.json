It was not an auspicious beginning. Bristol University makes it very clear throughout Freshers' Week what is expected of its new students: hard work, commitment and high standards. A combination of extraneous issues had left me feeling that starting a degree course as a mature student was going to be all too much. Luckily Angela was both reassuring and encouraging. Nearly a year on, the six of us \"matures\" who have worked our way through the first year of our psychology degree at Bristol have passed our exams, got our coursework in, been introduced to new concepts and skills, and come out alive at the other end. We have gone from being complete strangers to a close-knit and supportive little group. None of us knew what to expect back in October of last year: so, what's it like being a (relatively) ancient first year? The definition of a mature student is anyone who is aged 21 or over at the start of their course (over 20s in Scotland), so we are by no means geriatric. Only two of us, including me, are on the far side of 30. I'm nearly a year older than Angela, which I know because she invited us all to her birthday party. One of the perks of being a mature is that lecturers seem perfectly approachable human beings, though it's slightly disconcerting when a number look considerably younger than yourself. As matures, we are part of a growing band. The figures for 2006, when I was accepted, represented an 18% rise over the previous five years. In 2007, UK universities accepted 36,334 mature applicants aged 21-24. Of these, 29,343 were aged 25-39, and 8,320 aged over 40. We're a diverse bunch and have arrived here by a variety of routes. Dorota E Filipowicz, 27, has travelled from Gdansk. She downplays the difficulties of taking a degree in a language that isn't her first. \"I didn't have a clear image of what I was expecting, but it's very different from the Polish experience, much better organised. The best thing about the year has been thinking 'Wow, I'm doing this'. I feel my brain is working again.\" Nik Hubbard, 27, and Kanteba Gilling, 26, both gained their places after following an access course. \"I wanted to study psychology quite a while back, but I thought university wasn't for me,\" says Kanteba. \"I worked for a few years and had my child, but I was still thinking about it and I started with an Open University course. It was hard trying to work and study, and I felt if I was going to achieve, I needed the environment to do it, so I did the access course.\" Nik left school at 16. As he says, you're a different person when you're a teenager. \"I tried a college course then drifted along in loads of jobs. Then I suddenly thought my brain was rotting - the job I was in was not even the slightest challenge. So I decided to try and get into university.\" Alice Gibbs (\"you can just describe me as very mature\") is doing her degree purely for her own satisfaction. \"My children are all grown up, my business is ticking over nicely - and I want to do this for myself.\" Like me, Alison Wylie, 26, is taking her second degree: she already has a chemistry degree and a master's from Oxford. \"When I finished the course, I knew I didn't want to do anything related to chemistry. I had wanted to do a psychology A-level but I was the only one in the school. Within two months of starting an evening class in psychology, I knew I wanted to do a degree. I could see myself being interested in it all my life. The crucial difference now is that I'm doing this degree because I want to.\" Bristol groups its matures for tutorials, and Alison believes this is a big advantage. \"I was worried I would be older and 'different', but the other matures have the same other responsibilities and the same attitude to study, which is an enormous boost.\" It's been nice not to feel isolated, she says, especially as none of us live in halls of residence, which is where younger students tend to make friends and socialise. We've had the full academic experience, from lectures for several hundred to tutorials for six. In the first year, Bristol students also follow two \"open units\" on subjects not related to their degree, so between us we have clocked up extras as diverse as archaeology, Japanese and Hebrew. It's not all been plain sailing, however. I think we've all felt genuinely challenged by the academic work (don't ask me about my statistics grades). For Alice (who runs a care home) and myself, juggling work commitments has been an issue, though Dorota (who works as a nursing assistant) says study alongside work has been fine. Overall, first-year worries have dissipated and we're all looking forward. \"Give it a go,\" says Nik. \"Even if it's hard, it feels good when you find you can manage.\" Alison's advice to second-timers is to learn from the first time around. \"Think about what you liked and do it again, and learn from any mistakes, whether those might be choosing the wrong subject, not going to the right university, or not working hard enough.\" \"I would encourage anyone who wants to keep active post child-rearing to take up studies again,\" adds Alice. \"It's by no means easy, but this first year has shown me that with support and understanding from the tutor and peer group, those of us who have not studied for a long time can fall into the pattern of time management and stimulating work.\" All of us are hoping to pursue psychology further and Angela says this is typical of mature students. \"Mature students are more sure about their direction, and that brings dedication,\" she says. \"They often haven't done exams for a while and are less sure of their skills, but that pushes them to work harder.\" Angela has seen us all change over the year. \"When you arrived, there was a real sense of trepidation; 'Can we do this?' It's not always easy to make the transition to being a student but I think everyone has done really well.\" We all live in Bristol and will be meeting up over the long vacation. We regroup for the autumn term on September 29, and the second year, says Angela, will be a further challenge. \"But you'll all rise to it. It's lovely seeing mature students flourish - and surprise themselves.\" A guide for the ... ahem ... more mature student Don't regress to your teenage years; 40 isn't 18, never has been, never will be Don't ever say anything that has the whiff of \"I'm older and wiser\". No one will be impressed that you remember the days before email/the horse-drawn carriage Do ask for technological help if you need it. You'll be working with the PowerPoint generation; they may find it hilarious that you've never met a memory stick, but they will be glad to help you out Do enjoy the chance to interact with enthusiastic, intelligent young people: they are lovely!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
