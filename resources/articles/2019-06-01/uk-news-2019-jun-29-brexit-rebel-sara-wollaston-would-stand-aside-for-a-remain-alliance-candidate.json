Sarah Wollaston, who resigned from the Conservative party over its Brexit stance, said the threat of a \u201cpopulist\u201d autumn election meant there was now a sense of urgency for Remain parties to come together to fight the danger of a hard Brexit. \u201cWe do not have the luxury of time,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cAn election could easily happen in the autumn and we have to be prepared for that, rather than trying to put something together in a hurry and find it\u2019s too late. There should be a sense of urgency. \u201cAt both local and national level, the pro-Remain parties need to be talking about how a Remain alliance could work in practice, looking at all the available data on how it could be done, and which party is best placed in each seat. It won\u2019t work everywhere, nor will the model necessarily be the same in every seat, but I think Remain voters want to see a progressive, Remain alliance across the country.\u201d Her comments come amid predictions that a Boris Johnson victory in the Tory leadership contest would precipitate an autumn election, as a result of his vow to leave the EU at the end of October, even without a deal. An attempt to forge a Remain alliance during the Peterborough byelection last month broke down, despite talks between the Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK. However, Jo Swinson, one of two candidates to become the next leader of the Lib Dems, has said she wants to work with other groups and alliances to stop the UK leaving the EU through a second referendum. Asked about her future in her Totnes constituency, Wollaston said she would \u201cwelcome the opportunity\u201d to run again if local parties thought she was the best unity candidate. However, she added: \u201cI would not want to obstruct them or get in the way, either. I would not run against a Remain-alliance candidate. I would stand aside in those circumstances, but I would love to carry on my work representing the Totnes constituency and fighting against a disastrous no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt looks like [we] could be heading for a populist election campaign and we need to be in as strong a position as possible should that happen.\u201d Wollaston is one of six MPs who defected to join pro-Remain Change UK, and then left the group to sit as an independent. One of the others, Chuka Umunna, has since joined the Lib Dems, who were the strongest pro-Remain party at last month\u2019s European elections. Wollaston, chair of the Commons health select committee, said she would wait to see who the Lib Dems appointed as their next leader before deciding whether to consider joining the party. \u201cI am currently sitting as an independent and that fits well with my work as a select committee chair,\u201d she said. \u201cI am waiting to see how the party\u2019s leadership election plays out before making any decisions. \u201cJo Swinson seems to have indicated she is more open to alliances.\u201d She said she had been alarmed by the number of Tory MPs who were against a no-deal Brexit, but had been unwilling to break party unity to stop it happening. \u201cIt has amazed me that so many MPs seem to have put the future of the Conservative party above everything else and that they would rather a no-deal Brexit over a Jeremy Corbyn government,\u201d she said. \u201cBut their actions mean we could end up getting both \u2013 if we crash out, with all the real-world consequences and the Conservatives losing all credibility on the economy, then have an election in which Labour wins and it gets even worse.\u201d She urged Corbyn to change Labour\u2019s stance to become a clearly anti-Brexit party. However, she questioned whether voters would trust the party should it change course now. \u201cI would love to see Labour change its position and say unequivocally that it backs a second referendum and would campaign as a pro-Remain party,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even now Jeremy Corbyn is still resisting that, supported by a small number of people around him. The question is, even if the party did change its position now, how credible would that be? Locally, Labour candidates may back Remain, but it is a problem if that is not the party\u2019s clear official position.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
