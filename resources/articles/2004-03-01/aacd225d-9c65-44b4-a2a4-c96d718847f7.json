Eidur Gudjohnsen took his turn on Saturday, just as Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and John Terry have over the last fortnight, but the manager cannot have helped but notice that Abramovich has steadfastly refused to break the policy of omerta. Being employed by a club whose owner's motives arouse so much suspicion cannot be easy, either for Ranieri or the players he has assembled with Abramovich's millions. The uncertainty does not promote a spirit of togetherness so, however fortuitous this victory and however patchy their form over the last two months, Ranieri should be commended rather than castigated now they are above Manchester United and threatening to finish ahead of them in the league for the first time since 1990. Having scored the goal that saw them leapfrog United on goal difference, Gudjohnsen made the point that their first-ever second-placed finish in the Premiership should ordinarily represent a successful season. \"The manager has always said the aim this season was to improve and second place would be a huge improvement. For me, it would be an achievement in itself to finish above Manchester United. I mean, how many years is it since Chelsea have done that? \"All this speculation about the manager is not helping anyone. It's not for me to tell Chelsea how to act but it's time people got off his back. We can only get better with this group of players but it was always going to take time when you have so many new signings. Maybe next season will be the championship season.\" Ranieri's vulnerability is not, however, a media invention. Abramovich's continued silence speaks volumes, as do the negative vibes emanating from the new chief executive Peter Kenyon. Chelsea are an exceptionally impatient club in an exceptionally impatient business, and Abramovich and Kenyon share the old Liverpool maxim that first is first, second is nowhere. Finishing as runners-up to Arsenal may save Ranieri's job, but only if he wins the European Cup, too. Besides, hailing Chelsea as the second-best team in England right now can hardly be done with conviction, given the heavy dose of fortune that accompanied this victory. Even by City's standards of wastefulness, this was a remarkable demonstration of profligacy from Kevin Keegan's players. Out-passing opponents without outscoring them has become a regular theme of their first season at the City of Manchester stadium, one that has seen them win only two home games in the league and none since October 18. \"Claudio summed it up better than me,\" said Keegan. \"He said: 'You played fantastic, we played poor. You lose and we win. It's football - crazy.' And then he just walked off.\" Keegan could reflect on a dozen presentable opportunities but squandering so many should really have left him bemoaning bad finishing rather than bad luck. \"We should have the best home record in the country because we've been murdering teams here,\" said Keegan. \"We've totally outplayed Chelsea but if we can't win when we've played that well we're going to be sucked into trouble.\" Doubtless, Nicolas Anelka would have accepted one of the chances had he had not been suspended, but at least Robbie Fowler is showing glimpses of the form that could trouble the most accomplished defender. Earlier this season Fowler was carrying the sort of extra baggage that made him a bad person to go on a seesaw with, but he has shed the unwanted pounds and looks motivated again. Steve McManaman, too, has considerably improved whereas Shaun Wright-Phillips, arguably their most impressive player this season, gave Wayne Bridge a torrid afternoon. Bridge had good reason to be grateful that Sven-Goran Eriksson was not among a record attendance, although it was a lovely pass with the outside of his left boot that set up Gudjohnsen, played onside by Sylvain Distin, to lob David James for a goal he later described as \"daylight robbery\". Man of the match: Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City) \u00b7 PSV Eindhoven are close to striking a cooperation deal with Chelsea. The proposed link-up between PSV and Chelsea would resemble the deal Manchester United signed with the Belgian club Antwerp in 1998."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
