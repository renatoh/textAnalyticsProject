Conversations around which is better than the other tend to involve Game of Thrones levels of acrimony, digressing into equivocations about the soul-enlivening benefits of harbourfront views (Sydney) or the virtues of getting sozzled inside wardrobe-sized bars hidden down smelly laneways (Melbourne). Despite its ubiquity in real life, films and TV productions exploring the Melbourne-Sydney argy-bargy are anomalies at best. A rare example of a production positioning the debate as a central theme is director Michael Jenkins\u2019s 1988 dramedy Emerald City, about a hotshot screenwriter who relocates from the city of bohemian honkytonks to the city of corporate buildings and sun-kissed water. Adapted from David Williamson\u2019s popular play of the same name, it is underrated among the veteran writer\u2019s screenplays. Thanks to Jenkins\u2019s direction and his cast\u2019s energy it plays in a higher, shriller key than most of Williamson\u2019s stage-to-screen transitions \u2013 more The Club in its verbal cha-cha-cha than a slower-paced chinfest like Don\u2019s Party. An A-grade cast (including John Hargreaves, Robyn Nevin, Chris Haywood, Nicole Kidman and Ruth Cracknell) were instructed to deliver their lines in the machinegun style of old-school screwball comedies. A similar technique was deployed by director Bert Deling in another highly memorable Australian film, 1975\u2019s racy drug drama Pure Shit. This \u2013 as well as Emerald City more broadly \u2013 was greeted contentiously by critics. In his book The Avocado Plantation, David Stratton noted that \u201cAustralians do not talk like characters from Hollywood films of the 40s\u201d. But nobody, including sassy New York cool cats, ever really spoke like that outside of the movies, making it clearly a stylistic embellishment. The approach adds energy, vitality and a ping-pong quality to the dialogue, giving it a real get-up-and-go. It also suits the flying-off-the-handle lead performance of John Hargreaves, returning to another role as a hot-under-the-collar bloke working through relationship difficulties with his partner (following 1978\u2019s Long Weekend and 1984\u2019s My First Wife). We meet Colin (Hargreaves), his publisher wife Kate (Robyn Nevin) and their two kids as they prepare to move from Melbourne to Sydney. At a film premiere Colin meets a sort-of producer, sort-of shyster Mike (Chris Haywood, in an AFI award-winning performance) who emerges from a bathroom at the State Theatre talking fast and sniffing, presumably having partaken in a round of powder-infused sinus damage. Colin is entranced by Mike\u2019s significantly younger girlfriend Helen (Nicole Kidman), who descends the stairs in a gaudy gold dress and fattens his ego with compliments. They embark in a lusty to-and-fro that comes to a head in a bizarre sequence where the writer flips out, hallucinating terrifying visions of what could go wrong if they have an affair. Jenkins, who also directed 1995\u2019s terrific true crime miniseries Blue Murder, jumps between highly personal and highly judgmental voiceovers delivered by a range of characters. Like the fourth wall-breaking narration in The Sum of Us, it\u2019s an odd embellishment but it works. Before the family move, for example, we hear Colin\u2019s inner monologue kvetching about Kate\u2019s Melbourne friends. \u201cThey were the biggest middle-class trendies of the lot,\u201d he says. \u201cMelbourne breeds them. Pricks! Loathsome, do-gooding, trendy pricks!\u201d Jenkins then goes inside Kate\u2019s mind for a counter-opinion: \u201cSydney always seemed to me a city without a soul. My Melbourne friends cared about more than money and fame. They cared about people, causes, justice.\u201d Emerald City projects another perspective rare in Australian cinema, commenting on the business end of production and \u201ccreative\u201d decisions made in service of the almighty dollar. It focuses on a very particular time, when an incredibly generous tax incentive known as the 10BA was in full swing \u2013 leading to widespread rorting and a slew of films that were, shall we say, not Fellini. Elaine (Ruth Cracknell, in fine form) is a take-no-guff producer whose approach to cutting deals is so conniving she might as well be stroking a cat or pulling the lever of a trapdoor. A key sequence in her apartment/office (harbourside, of course) sees her and Colin ferociously lock horns. It\u2019s not the first time either character loses their shit but it\u2019s the most memorable, Williamson\u2019s red-hot dialogue segueing from industry-related bickering back to that old chestnut: the Melbourne-Sydney rivalry. Colin, appalled by what he perceives to be a city awash with dodgy deals, howls that Sydney is all about \u201cMoney! Fashion! Fads! Corruption! Compromise!\u201d Elaine fires back: \u201cIntelligence! Professionalism! Standards! Dedication!\u201d She has a counter for everything, essentially arguing the city is a cradle of the best and the worst. The debate will, of course, continue from now until approximately the end of time. Anybody who wants some ammunition, for either side of the war, will find plenty of zingers in a film that \u2013 excluding its wildly upbeat 80s score \u2013 holds up well over time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
