Much to my annoyance he had nabbed the last lobster, but my disappointment soon evaporated when we sat down to a feast of fish so fresh it took me back to childhood holidays in northern Spain when we used to go out line fishing and barbecue the resulting catch on the rocks. We were in The Fish Shed in Devon, a fish and chip shop where you pick your fish straight from the slab and then have it fried in beer batter or simply grilled with a little olive oil by an enthusiastic crew of fisherman chefs. The fish is bought from three or four private boats, they guarantee that nothing is more than 12 hours old, and it is practically all line caught. When you compare this to the stringy curls of de-frosted oil-sodden slabs served up in so many chip shops, it is truly amazing that you get it all for a fiver, and if that man hadn't beaten me to it, I could have had the lobster for just over a tenner. The owner, David Kerley, scallop diver and ex-restaurateur, pinched the idea from the Australians, and it is a no-frills affair. You take your food away or sit at rough trestle tables with a cardboard box and a wooden knife and fork. But who needs frills when the quality of the produce is this good? My griddled scallops with bacon were served with chunks of bulb fennel, courgettes and peppers, were sweet to perfection, and as we cracked open the battered haddock, the flesh fell apart in soft white flakes. We had to order more, lemon sole and chunks of monkfish tail, diving in with our fingers and completely forgetting to eat our chips or even try the garlic mayonnaise. We washed it all down with a bottle of Green Valley vintage cider, bought conveniently five steps away at Dart's Farm. And there's the joy - The Fish Shed is attached to another much larger shack, a farm shop of emporium dimensions filled with all the best Devon produce under one roof. It was like finding Selfridges Food Hall dumped in the middle of a field, except with affordable prices and all the produce originating from a 30-mile radius. A bracing walk was much needed after such a lavish lunch, so we drove to Mutter's Moor on the fringes of Sidmouth. The area is named after Abraham Mutter, a turf cutter and colleague of the notorious smuggler Jack Rattenbury, and it is said that Abraham cut turf at Peak Hill and carried the fuel into nearby towns for sale, hiding French brandy in the loads. We walked along the high ridge, schlepping through the red mud rather than spongy turf, but I love the ruddle-coloured soil of Devon and it is never so beautiful as when seen as a sheer cliff drop from the brilliant green hills to the hard blue sea. One could imagine that the coves around would have made excellent hiding places for small boats full of illicit liquor, anchoring on the tiny shingle beaches where the pebbles give way to ruby sand. We pushed on towards the faded Regency grandeur of Sidmouth to find beaches backed by jutting, wind-smoothed buttresses of sandstone, striped with blooms of sea salt like melting blocks of ice-cream. The sun went down and we headed back to Topsham, the historic port to Exeter. We were staying at The Galley, a fish restaurant \"with cabins\" run by celebrity master chef, Paul Da-Costa-Greaves and his partner, Mark Wright. The decor of both the restaurant and the accommodation is high glam, with gold taps in the bathrooms and Botticelli's Birth of Venus rising from the tiles by the bath. We were staying in Cabin 1 on the second floor of Ship Aground, a 17th-century cottage. We were welcomed with a comforting fire, hot tea and home-made lavender biscuits. It is a fun place for dinner as Paul and Mark pull out all the stops to lavish you with attention and make you feel like royalty. The local fish was perfectly cooked with imaginative extras such as chilli ice-cream and seaweed tartar sauce, and we finished with Paul's particularly delicious Forbidden Fruit Pudding, which is marinated for four weeks in white Jamaican rum. The next morning we rolled out of our cabin to check out the town, with a bag of Paul's seaweed relishes to take home. The estuary was calm as glass and we took the circular walk behind the town and past the bird sanctuary before stopping for tea. Topsham, in common with the rest of this area, has smuggling connections - the houses were once linked by a network of over 200 secret tunnels. Broadway House, now the Georgian Tea Rooms, was supposed to be a meeting place for the bootleggers, and the panels of leather wallpaper in the entrance hall allegedly originate from the captain's cabin of a Spanish galley. A secret passage can still be found in the cellar, and you can stay in this historical den of iniquity for a mere \u00a325 a night. The owner, Heather Knee, also happens to be a great cook, and fans travel from as far as Japan to try her stew and dumplings and sumptuous afternoon tea, eaten \"Asian style, all at the same time,\" she told me. \"Clotted cream scones in between mouthfuls of soup and steamed pudding.\" Topsham was a thriving centre of commerce in the 17th century, and many Dutch gabled merchant houses still survive. Most houses include Dutch bricks which were brought from Holland as ballast before filling the holds with English goods such as serge cloth. We took a tour around the Reka Dom (Russian for river house) on The Strand, supposedly named after a Russian envoy of Peter the Great who lodged there while studying shipbuilding. The tour constituted a fascinating progression through the architectural history of the building, from its origins as a \"cottage in the field of the seven lime kilns\" in the ship-building days, through its heyday as the grand house of an 18th-century wine merchant, to its present incarnation as a comfortable and rambling family home. One particularly interesting addition to the house was a water tower built by William Hopton-Wild in order to accommodate the drinking water he had delivered every week by horse and cart from St Anne's well in Exeter. No one knows why he refused to drink the local water but the tower is now a sitting room with 360-degree views that can be enjoyed by anyone wishing to rent it. On the way out of Topsham, we stopped at The Bridge Inn, a pub so old that it is thought that the stonemasons who built Exeter cathedral in the 12th century once resided there. Most of the present building dates from the 16th century and, incredibly, the bar hasn't changed since then. The walls are made of polished black oak, and we ordered our ale from a hatch in a panelled snug lit only by the open fire in the inglenook fireplace. The inn has been run by the Cheffers family since 1897, and the present landlady, Caroline Cheffers-Heard, keeps the place as it always has been. She took me to the old cob-walled brew house at the back, with the remains of the hop drying floor, adjacent to a large brewing chimney. She serves a fantastic selection of real ales straight from the keg (no rubber tubes here) which change almost daily. I tried a half of wheat beer with my ploughman's, then the Plunge beer, and then the Branock. People come down from London by train especially to drink at this pub and I can see why (even the Queen dropped in in 1998, a visit so historic that Private Eye put her on the front cover. There she is, leaning on the bar beside Caroline's father with a speech bubble coming from her mouth saying \"Oi Phil, you want a pint or what!\") On the way home, we couldn't resist stopping off again at the Fish Shed and Dart's. We left with four fillets of lemon sole, three bottles of single orchard cider, two homemade cakes, some curly kale and a sack of Dart's potatoes; and all straight from the producers without a hefty price-tag. We'll be back again shortly. Way to go Where to stay: Reka Dom , 43 The Strand, Topsham (01392 873385, rekadom.co.uk). B&amp;B \u00a335-37pp. Lunches and suppers on request.
