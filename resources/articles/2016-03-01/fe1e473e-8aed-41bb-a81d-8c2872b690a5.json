Ibrahimovic is known to be open to playing in the Premier League and United are considering moving for him in the next transfer window, according to the French newspaper L\u2019Equipe. The Swedish striker is represented by Mino Raiola, who stated that his client had a clear plan of where he wished to play when departing PSG. \u201cWe know what we want but we won\u2019t say anything until the summer when the season is over,\u201d Raiola told the Swedish newspaper Expressen. \u201cWe have a clear idea of what we want to do. I know what he\u2019s counting on doing but we don\u2019t want you to know for the moment.\u201d Whether United do try to sign Ibrahimovic will rest on who is the manager in place for next season. The future of Louis van Gaal is in some doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
