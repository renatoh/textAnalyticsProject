Gods recognise gods'", "bodyText": "If Conor McGregor respects his next opponent, Rafael dos Anjos, he\u2019s certainly not showing it in public. At a press conference to promote their lightweight title fight, which takes place in Las Vegas in March, the Irishman flung insult after insult at his Brazilian opponent. \u201cI believe I will dust him inside the first minute,\u201d said McGregor. \u201cHe\u2019s a slower version of [McGregor\u2019s previous opponent] Jose Aldo, he\u2019s a bum version of Aldo. I will drag his head through the streets of Rio de Janeiro through a parade of people. It will become a national holiday.\u201d Dos Anjos now lives in California after moving from his native Brazil four years ago, and McGregor was quick to pounce on his opponent\u2019s background. \u2018I\u2019ll send him back to California, his home. I swear to God, at UFC 194 I fought Jose Aldo, I KO\u2019d the country of Brazil\u2019s true champion, said McGregor. \u201c[Aldo] never learned the language of his oppressor, he never came to America, he trusted his people, unlike this guy across from me. That\u2019s why the Brazilian people love Jose Aldo. When he steps off a plane, his people greet him regardless of the result. \u201cWe\u2019re sending Rafael on a four-day media run throughout Brazil and we\u2019ve got to book him a hotel. I have got to book him a hotel in his own country. He will never receive a hero\u2019s welcome because he ran from Brazil. This guy, in Brazilian lingo, is a gringo.\u201d Some of McGregor\u2019s venom may have stemmed from his placing in the poster to promote the fight. Although it is often hard to tell what is real and what is confected outrage from a showman such as McGregor, at times on Wednesday it sounded much more like the latter. \u201cThis is a superfight. I look up on that poster, I see myself tucked in the back there. I see a guy, his last gate was $1.7m. He fought on free TV,\u201d said McGregor. \u201cHe\u2019s never brought a dime to the company. He\u2019s never made a dime, yet he is sitting there on the front of my poster. I think that\u2019s a department that needs to be looked at. Somebody\u2019s sleeping on the job.\u201d Once McGregor had finished with mortals, he went on to compare himself with higher beings. \u201cMe and Jesus are cool. I\u2019m cool with all the gods. Gods recognise gods.\u201d For his part, Dos Anjos refused to shake McGregor\u2019s hand at the end of the press conference, and was more measured in his comments. \u201cThis guy is calling me a traitor just because I live here but I have my kids here, I have my family,\u201d said Dos Anjos. \u201cI\u2019m not a trash talker, I respect my opponents and I talk the truth. On 5 March I will send this guy home sad and I am going to keep my belt. \u201cI\u2019m a complete fighter. I fight standing, I fight on the ground.I beat Ben Henderson, Nate Diaz, Anthony Pettis, Donald Cerrone twice. I fought better guys, taller guys and stronger guys.\u201d McGregor and Dos Anjos will fight on the same card as Holly Holm, who famouly shocked Ronda Rousey in Australia last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
