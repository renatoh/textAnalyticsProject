Susannah's unsolicited admirers used to be wildly drunk thirtysomething men who'd stagger over at the end of a party to suggest sex in a corridor. Now, very young men are approaching her cold at clubs, industry dos and even at work. They tell her she's gorgeous and that they want to take her on a date. This isn't Mrs Robinson territory, when an inexperienced young guy is chased by a sexually predatory older woman. Susannah isn't doing the seducing: they are. She's not looking for a toy-boy experience, or the luxury perk of a younger man. But she can't help being flattered that these drop-dead handsome whippersnappers would rather woo her than nubiles their own age. It's probably a generational thing, but Susannah has noticed that they always come out with the same chat-up lines. First they ask if she minds them talking to her - subtly implying that she's more important than them. Then they say something flattering like: 'Every time we've met, I've thought you're really beautiful. Can I take you out?' 'I'm quite practised at responding by now,' Susannah says. 'I always laugh and say, \"I'm extremely flattered\", then say something funny like, \"I've got food in my fridge that's older than you.\" They always say: \"Don't be ridiculous, why are you talking about your age? You're putting yourself down.\" Then they say: \"This isn't an age thing, it's a man-woman thing.\"' The seduction doesn't stop there. At home an hour or so later, she'll get a text message. 'You don't know what you do to me,' or 'Hi baby, I'd like to get to know you.' 'These men haven't kissed me, or established the level of my interest, but they text the same night,' says Susannah. She quite likes it, though. In fact, she's more disillusioned by the chat-ups of men her own age. 'There, the subtext is macho and arrogant. They think: she's single, she's available, therefore she'll fancy me.' The game-playing of courtship with thirtysomething men, where much more is at stake, annoys her. She's seriously thinking about ditching her principles and dating one of the male-model Travis Fimmel lookalikes. Elizabeth, who works in advertising, has also recently started getting a lot of boy attention. She's 31, with an impressive job hobnobbing with media executives and celebrities. But she was still surprised to find a young, admittedly handsome, office trainee coming on to her. He texted her day and night, telling her how much he wanted to go out with her. 'It was flattering,' she says, 'because he was so gentle and good-natured about it. It was casual chat interspersed with sweet requests for a date. If a man my age texted me at 3am, I'd find it creepy and unnatural.' If this sounds like over-hormonal, over-sexed boys on the make, well, yes, that's certainly a part of it. But according to Ronald Bracey, a consultant clinical psychologist specialising in male sexuality and emotional issues, too much is probably made of the biological synchronicity of the older woman/ younger man combo. 'Yes, women reach their sexual peak in their thirties and forties,' he says, 'whereas men do in their late teens.' So your typical 19-year-old lad can do it six times a night; your typical 35-year-old man is struggling to do it twice. But hey, who's counting? Most thirtysomething women have to go to work in the morning, and all-night sex sessions aren't their priority. The sexually experienced older woman is still an enduring archetype for young men, but the point about fantasy is that it's meant to be unattainable. Ten years ago, that young trainee wouldn't have dared text his boss and ask her on a date. So what's changed now? Women have, for starters. Bracey thinks the allure of the thirtysomething woman is greatly underplayed. 'Nowadays, women are sexually confident by their early thirties, and that is hugely attractive,' he says. 'They see you as J-Lo,' says Susannah. 'Men my own age see me as Bridget Jones, strident and desperate.' Young men are also very resilient, with a crash-and-burn philosophy: if she says yes, great, if not, onwards. They text at 3am, says Bracey, because they are eager to communicate whatever the hour. They may have 20 girls on their text list - friends, lovers, ex-lovers, women they met yesterday. Generation Y's relationship template is fluid and impermanent: they don't make the assumption that what you will do in life is meet someone, settle down and marry till death do you part. Susannah is clear that her attraction is, as David Beckham said of Posh Spice, 'The whole package.' In her case, that's a sophisticated glamour that doesn't come without the benefit of a regular, single-woman-with-no-dependents pay cheque. She is unapologetically high maintenance and well-groomed. She may not be the best-looking woman in the room, but she is very confident, very funny, and totally unafraid. 'I'm quite gregarious and loud,' she says. 'Men of my age find that a nightmare, but younger men find that attractive.' Elizabeth once asked one of her texters what her appeal was. He said: 'Well, it's nice for a young guy, you've got your own flat, your own car, and clean fluffy towels.' 'I think it's a comfort thing,' she says. 'They live in nasty student digs or share a flat. Who can blame them?' She points out that successful men have always gone for younger women, perhaps now the reverse is taking place. Young men entering the workforce find themselves at the bottom of the food chain, so why wouldn't they use every tool they've got, from their looks to the power and influence that comes with the protection of an older partner. 'For young men, being with a successful woman in her early thirties is a steep learning curve,' says Bracey. 'They practise grown-up things, and get empowered by taking on a bigger social role.' But can it work as a long-term relationship? Bracey thinks not, and not because of the thirtysomething woman's biological imperative to have children. 'What's against it is that people in their early twenties are still experimenting and searching, which is not a good basis for a permanent relationship.' Should Susannah, who after a year is finally tempted to say yes to one particular 20-year-old, stay well away? 'I'm tempted,' she says, 'but I know we won't have shared points of reference, which is important to me. How will we joke together?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
