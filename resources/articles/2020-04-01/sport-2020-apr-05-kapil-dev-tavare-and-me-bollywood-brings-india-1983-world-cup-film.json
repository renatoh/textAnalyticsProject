Casting feature film based on 1983 cricket World Cup. Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia and Zimbabwe teams.\u201d Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t hide away my whites just yet, I think. I send the talent agency a headshot and a brief summary of my playing ability, and a week later I\u2019m asked to Lord\u2019s to audition for the part of Chris Tavar\u00e9. To prepare I\u2019m asked to \u201chave a look at some online footage of how he bowls, bats, catches, celebrates, etc, so you have an idea of his personality traits and style\u201d. I was three years old when the 1983 World Cup took place and I remember Tavar\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries Mike Gatting, David Gower and Allan Lamb better than him. But we have a similar height and build. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cstyle of play was characterised by long periods at the crease and a relatively slow rate of run-scoring\u201d, Wikipedia says, and I can do that. Mostly I grind it out when I play for Pacific CC in the North East London League. Among Tavar\u00e9\u2019s most tedious innings was a score of 35 runs in six and a half hours at Madras. \u201cAs [Ian] Botham brought the crowd to its feet, Tavar\u00e9 did his utmost to make them sit down again,\u201d wrote Marcus Berkmann in Rain Men. \u201cHere was dullness personified, a walking, twitching anaesthetic.\u201d In one of the first YouTube videos to appear when I type Chris Tavar\u00e9 the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord\u2019s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting \u201cTav\u201d out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavar\u00e9 is gracious in defeat. The Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including that of his friend Tavar\u00e9. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. Botham and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019. \u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d Another YouTube video shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32. When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981. When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing. Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square. The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them. \u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali. \u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League. When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started. \u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could. \u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d. Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says. In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory. Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 the first spectacularly so. \u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.\u201d The film, to be called simply 83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
