The 30-year-old winger was conspicuous by his absence from the Portsmouth squad for Saturday's Premiership match away to Sunderland. Portsmouth's manager Alain Perrin, already under pressure after an unsatisfactory run of results, was able to name only four substitutes at the Stadium of Light when Robert ruled himself out because of injury after the team was named. Perrin was already short of options because Salif Diao had failed a pre-match fitness test. Robert, on a long-term loan from Newcastle United, has since tendered his apologises for the incident, admitting that he should have brought the matter of his injury to light earlier, and has been fined an undisclosed amount, believed to be two weeks' wages. In the event Portsmouth overcame their lack of numbers by coming from behind to secure a 4-1 victory on Wearside and putting some distance between themselves and the bottom three. There had been calls in some quarters for Robert's loan period to be terminated immediately and for him to be sent packing back to Newcastle, but the club chairman Milan Mandaric now considers the matter closed and hopes Robert will soon be making headlines again for the right reasons. \"Laurent has apologised to the manager, his team-mates and me. His biggest apology, however, is to the fans,\" Mandaric said. \"The player knows he has made a mistake and everyone is entitled to make one of those. \"He has received a club fine, which he accepts along with the fact that there should have been much better communication with the medical team, and thus manager, at a much earlier time. The issue is resolved as far as we are concerned and we need Laurent to be firing on all cylinders, so I would ask everyone to now put this to one side and concentrate on backing the team and all the players.\" Mandaric added: \"Fans were naturally upset, but everyone at the club has now accepted the player's apology and are focused entirely on the match next Saturday. I would ask fans to do the same.\" Perrin had every reason to feel vindicated by the emphatic manner in which his side overcame Sunderland, especially given one of Robert's recent criticisms was of an over-reliance on defensive tactics. The Portsmouth manager made little attempt to hide his frustration over Robert's late withdrawal when speaking after the match as the issue overshadowed a reinvigorated performance. Perrin also hopes to move on. \"I have spoken to Laurent, and he has told me he made an error and has apologised to me, the chairman and team-mates,\" Perrin said. \"He also apologises unreservedly to the supporters, especially those who made the long trip to Sunderland to see the team. \"He told me that he had a small pain in his groin and I told him that the medical team and I should have been informed much earlier of this, which the player fully accepts.\" Robert apologised for \"any confusion\" his decision may have caused. \"I am very sorry for the team, players and the manager for any misunderstanding,\" said the Frenchman, who endured a turbulent relationship with the Newcastle manager Graeme Souness before leaving St James' Park during the summer. \"My hamstring was very sore after training on Friday. I travelled to Sunderland, but became confused because Salif Diao got injured on Saturday morning. I wasn't 100% to play or sit on the bench. I know my body and prefer to rest. I told the manager and he understood.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
