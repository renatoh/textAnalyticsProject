If Redknapp's style was unique among modern football managers, it was regarded by the new Hammers board, headed by the chairman Tony Brown, as antediluvian, marking him out as a man who retained his fondness for blowing bubbles rather than donning a hard hat. Despite Redknapp's avowed intention to return the club to Europe, he adhered to his ingrained West Ham principles that losing with style was preferable to winning without it, which is why he continually compromised team balance to accommodate the flair of Paolo di Canio and Joey Cole in the same line-up. As a man without any delusions about his own capabilities, he would have opted to fall on his sword when he realised that, unless he accommodated the more prosaic views of the board, he had taken West Ham as far as he could. When he hinted at retirement last weekend by saying, \"Ask my missus if she wants another season like this one,\" it seemed just another of 'Arry's jokes. Yet perhaps he really had tired of trying to compete with the top six clubs with one arm, the chequebook-signing one, tied behind his back; really had tired of selling his best players and working at a training centre which he described as \"a khazi\"; really had tired of travelling to east London every day from Poole, where he has lived since his Bournemouth days. He and his assistant Frank Lampard would have known, too, that they were to receive only a fraction of the \u00a318m from the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds for their summer rebuilding, the board apparently having lost trust in his judgment in the transfer market. Redknapp will have gone with sadness but no regrets, being a man who has had a much broader perspective on life since the car crash that killed his friend Brian Tiler, the Bournemouth chairman, during the 1990 World Cup, an accident in which Redknapp himself was injured. He said only recently: \"It made me realise that you never know what will happen to you next and that there are far more important things than football.\" And blown-up photographs of another tragic hero, Redknapp's former friend and team-mate Bobby Moore, adorned the walls of his office at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground. There are other examples of Redknapp's awareness that his sport does not come close to a matter of life and death. At Southampton last November he walked out to inspect the pitch before the game and was touched by the sight of a man in the disabled enclosure tending a son suffering from cerebral palsy. The lad was so excited when he saw the West Ham manager looking at him that Redknapp climbed into the enclosure to chat to him. He then went to the Hammers' dressing room and returned with a shirt signed by all the players. He said: \"You should have seen the boy's little face and what it meant to him.\" It will be interesting to see if Redknapp remains in football since he has repeatedly stated that no other job in England would interest him, saying: \"The only thing that might tempt me would be a coaching job abroad, somewhere in the sun like Portugal.\" Tellingly, he has also spoken about a life after football, of wanting to spend more time with his wife Sandra and of improving his golf. After a highly successful career as player and manager, he is comfortably enough off to indulge all his off-field passions, which include a fanatical interest in horseracing. And typically of someone so down-to-earth, Redknapp has always been more of a Fontwell Park man than a Royal Ascot one. West Ham may find more success under a new manager but they cannot hope to find another man with Redknapp's skills at wheeling and dealing, the Ferdinand deal offering perhaps the best example. Redknapp talked up the price by declaring that he would never sell, yet when he finally closed the deal at such an extraordinary price there was not a bleat of protest from Hammers' fans. As brilliant a deal as that was, it was another reminder to Redknapp that his club are second-class citizens, who produce young players only for the adornment of the big teams. Perhaps he was glad to go before the day arrived when he was forced to sell young Cole, who could be the greatest treasure of all. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
