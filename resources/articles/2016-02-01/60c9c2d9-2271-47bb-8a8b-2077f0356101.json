The House of Lords struck out government plans last year to take up to \u00a31,500 year in benefit payments from 250,000 people with psychiatric conditions \u2013 but on Tuesday ministers will seek to overturn the decision. The government claims that reducing the amount paid to sick or disabled people currently unfit for work from \u00a3102.15 to \u00a372.40 per week will incentivise them to find employment. In a letter published in the Observer, Dr Alan Smith, the bishop of St Albans, writes that he has been left \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the contradiction between the prime minister\u2019s claims to want to tackle mental health problems and the government\u2019s actions in the realm of welfare. \u201cThe House of Lords called into serious question the notion that those found to be unable to work can be incentivised back to work by a cut to their living standards,\u201d he writes. \u201cI welcome the prime minister\u2019s initiative on mental healthcare, but I am puzzled why the government at the same time wants to cut out-of-work benefits to those with mental health problems.\u201d Last week this newspaper published details of a leaked report from NHS England\u2019s mental health taskforce, which disclosed the number of people killing themselves is rising, that three-quarters of those with psychiatric conditions are not being helped, and that sick children are being sent \u201calmost anywhere in the country\u201d for treatment. The study, overseen by Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, makes it clear that the situation is dire despite promises of reform. \u201cMany people struggle to get the right help at the right time and evidence-based care is underfunded,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe human cost is unacceptable and the financial cost is unaffordable.\u201d The prime minister subsequently accepted recommendations from the mental health taskforce, including that there should be access to services for people with psychiatric conditions on a 24/7 basis. The prime minister promised an extra \u00a31bn in funding to plug gaps in services. However, there are continued concerns that the money will not be invested and that the government is not placing enough attention on mental health in its welfare reforms. A Crossbench review, published by Lord Low, Baroness Meacher and Baroness Grey-Thompson, has found that the proposed cuts to people on employment support allowance, who are unfit for work, would be likely to hinder rather than help claimants seeking a way back into work, pushing them further into a cycle of poverty that would only exacerbate mental and physical health conditions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
