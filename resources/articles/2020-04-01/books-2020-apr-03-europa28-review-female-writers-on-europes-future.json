In this anthology, one female writer from each of the EU states, plus the UK, shares their vision for the future of Europe. Many write about freedom, and the wildly divergent pieces themselves make a statement about artistic freedom, including the freedom to be off the wall. Cheek by jowl, here are essays, stories, short plays and fragments of life writing. Le\u00efla Slimani (France) makes a plea for Europe to remember its Mediterranean past and to reconnect across \u201cour sea\u201d with north Africa, while Kapka Kassabova (Bulgaria) explores the disputed borders of the southern Balkans. In a standout piece, Irish actor Lisa Dwan brings the plays of Samuel Beckett to bear on dissolving the \u201cconfines of identity\u201d. The German writer Yvonne Hofstetter makes a case for Europe to develop as a \u201cmajor hegemonic power\u201d, but much of the writing focuses on the need for us to forge relationships with other human beings, particularly refugees. The scale of vision is ambitious, looking far back in history and across vast territories. Compassion and a plea for peaceful co-existence are the common themes in a bright celebration of unity in difference. \u2022 Europa28 is published by Comma."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
