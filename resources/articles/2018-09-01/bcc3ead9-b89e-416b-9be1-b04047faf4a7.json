Trump was speaking at an appearance in New York on Monday with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who claimed that North Korea\u2019s decision to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme was irreversible. The two presidents were meeting on the margins of the UN general assembly, where they signed a new bilateral trade agreement, and Moon said he was bringing a new message from Kim to Trump about a second summit. \u201cChairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly. And I think he wants to see something happen,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cSo we have done \u2026 done very well with respect to North Korea. \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a second summit with Chairman Kim in the not too distant future,\u201d the president added. \u201cAnd I think within a pretty short period of time, that will be announced and its location will be determined.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has been given the task of setting up a second summit and he told reporters in New York that he hoped to fly to Pyongyang soon. Trump\u2019s lavish compliments for Kim represent a remarkable turnaround from Trump\u2019s first appearance at the UN general assembly, almost exactly a year ago, when he hurled insults at Kim and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. Since then, the two leaders have held a summit in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a breakthrough in getting North Korea to disarm. But there has been very little, if any, progress in that direction. One rocket engine test site has been partially dismantled but it was for liquid fuel engines, while North Korea has switched to solid fuel for its missiles. At a meeting with Moon in Pyongyang last week, Kim made a more substantial offer to close facilities at its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, contingent on the US making unspecified \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d. Moon claimed that Kim\u2019s stated wish to \u201cdenuclearise the Korean peninsula\u201d meant that Pyongyang\u2019s decision \u201cto relinquish its nuclear programme has been officialized to a degree that not even those within North Korea can reverse\u201d. Moon showered Trump with praise, declaring: \u201cThanks to your bold decision and new approach, we are in the process of solving a problem that no one has been able to solve in the decades past.\u201d Nuclear experts are more sceptical over what North Korea has offered in terms of disarmament. \u201cThese are good soundbites and probably what the Americans want to hear,\u201d Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cBut under no definition of reverse could I say that North Korea couldn\u2019t make more or better nuclear weapons than it does now.\u201d The Pyongyang regime has made offers to disarm over earlier decades, both Trump and Moon have strong political incentives to portray negotiations with Kim as a historic success. The US president similarly described the trade deal with Seoul as a breakthrough and completely unlike an earlier deal, known as Korus, negotiated by the Obama administration. \u201cThis is a brand new agreement,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is not an old one, rewritten.\u201d However, James Schoff, a former senior adviser for east Asia policy at the Pentagon, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s claim that this is a new agreement is not accurate, since only a few portions of the original deal have been reworked (and they used the amendment process in Korus to get it done).\u201d Schoff added that the agreement signed with Moon would fall apart unless it exempts South Korea from future car tariffs that Trump plans to establish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
