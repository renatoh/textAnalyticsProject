As a teenager, I often felt insecure about my appearance, so I was happy to fade into the background. You\u2019d have found 15-year-old me in black trousers, a plain crop top and trainers so chunky they made my calves ache. I grew up in a white, middle class part of Cheshire; nobody really looked like me or had hair like mine. I spent a lot of time questioning my identity and what was deemed \u201cattractive\u201d. That meant I didn\u2019t always feel comfortable, so I was reluctant to push the boundaries when it came to fashion. But as I\u2019ve got to know myself better, learned more about my heritage and become happy with who I am, my love of colourful clothes has flourished. I\u2019m like a magpie \u2013 if something\u2019s bright and loud, I want to give it a try. I have my Ghanaian grandfather to thank for that. He was the sharpest dresser, with a huge collection of vibrant shirts. He passed his sense of style on to my mum, who is really creative. I have many happy memories of sitting with her at the kitchen table while she was busy on her sewing machine. Every morning, mum would appear wearing a completely different look from the day before \u2013 some days she\u2019d be in a sleek trouser suit, the next day in an oversized dress, sometimes in a turban, often with bright red lipstick. That really excited me and showed me that you could essentially become a different person every day, according to your clothes. Watching her made me realise that what you wear is an extension of who you are and how you\u2019re feeling. It also taught me that clothes have the power to enhance and even transform your wellbeing. So each morning \u2013 even if I\u2019m not working \u2013 I\u2019ll ask myself, what shall I wear that is going to help me feel good? And the answer is usually something colourful, like my bubblegum-pink jacket. I love it because I can tone it up or down (I have the matching trousers!) and every time I slip it on, it really boosts my mood. Clothes are anything but functional for me. Mum taught me to sew, and we loved scouring vintage and charity shops together for clothes we could customise. Giving things a distinctive twist is now very much part of my approach to fashion. I love being playful with my outfits, whether that\u2019s adding a colourful lightning bolt to a jacket or choosing a matching headscarf to wrap around my braids. I find that adding a little quirkiness can perk me up and improve my day. If you look in the mirror and make yourself smile, I think it sends a message to your brain that says: \u201cYou can do this. Let\u2019s go!\u201d In that sense, putting together an outfit can be like pulling on a suit of armour \u2013 it helps you feel ready for whatever comes your way. A lot has changed for the better but even now, in the television industry, someone might question my hair or the way I look because, to them, it\u2019s unconventional. In those moments, sticking to my own authentic style helps me feel positive. We all have insecurities that can hold us back \u2013 and whether it\u2019s body image or bladder weakness, the best thing you can do is be kind to yourself and be open about how you\u2019re feeling. A good friend has suffered with incontinence since she became a mum and we\u2019ve talked a lot about how it shouldn\u2019t be taboo and it certainly shouldn\u2019t stop her from wearing whatever she wants \u2013 with the right liners, pads and underwear, your style doesn\u2019t have to change. Feeling secure and confident in myself is a work in progress. I\u2019d like to think that as I get older and more challenges come my way, I\u2019ll be open about them. But having the courage to speak up depends on feeling secure. For me, making an effort with how I dress is key to that. With bladder weakness affecting one in three women over 35, it\u2019s time to overcome the taboos around incontinence. TENA aims to help women feel sexy, confident and able to wear what they like.
