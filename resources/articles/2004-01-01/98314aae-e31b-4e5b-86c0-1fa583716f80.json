Principally, what happened to the much-rumoured video iPod? There were reports, as long ago as December 2002, that Apple had shown off a prototype video iPod, and the sector has grown rapidly over the last 12 months. There are a lot on show here at CES (although the only one I've actually used for any time is the quite impressive Archos AV300) and Microsoft sees these kind of devices as hooking up to its Windows Media Centre PCs. So reporters from the New York Times (reg required) put the question to Steve Jobs at MacExpo, and got a reply that suggested Apple's been thinking about it but had problems - both with the concept, and the practicalities. He didn't rule it out - \"Now, I'm not saying we're not working on something like that... Who knows what we've got in our labs?\" - but clearly we shouldn't be holding our breath."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
