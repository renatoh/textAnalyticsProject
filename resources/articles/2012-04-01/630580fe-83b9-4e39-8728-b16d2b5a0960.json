Leaders of the Unite union concluded talks with representatives of six fuel distribution companies at the headquarters of the conciliation service Acas in London. The details of the new offer were not revealed. Diana Holland, the assistant general secretary of Unite, said the talks had been intense and complex. \"We have done as much as we can and we have a document we now can discuss. But we will keep the process confidential until the people who matter make the decision.\" Fears of fuel shortages caused panic buying before Easter, which led to queues and shortages at petrol stations. Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, advised drivers to stock up on petrol and fill jerry cans \u2013 until the dangers of storing fuel at home were pointed out. A woman in Yorkshire was badly burned when petrol she was transferring between two containers in her kitchen ignited. Peter Harwood, the chief conciliator of Acas, said: \"Over the past fortnight the six contractors have met with the Unite trade union through the Acas conciliation service. Acas has been shuttling between the parties and the process has been a challenging one, but we are pleased to announce that a set of proposals has been reached. The details of the proposals are confidential until the parties report back to their respective organisations. After that the details may be disclosed by the parties themselves.\" Unite is in dispute with the fuel distributors over safety and training standards. Unite members have voted for strikes at five companies. Friday was the last day on which the union could call a strike without having to reballot its 2,000 tanker driver members, but all parties agreed that the deadline could be extended to facilitate the talks. This means that Unite could call a strike without a new ballot if its members reject the offer. A spokesman for the Department of Energy said: \"The government welcomes the news that Unite plan to put a deal to their members. We hope that this will lead to the threat of strike action being lifted. The government continues to believe that any strike action is wrong and unnecessary. \"We will continue to work on contingency plans to increase the country's resilience in the event of a strike.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
