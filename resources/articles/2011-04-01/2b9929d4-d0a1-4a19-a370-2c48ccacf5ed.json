When Gordon Brown was prime minister, I attended a number of very similar receptions at Downing Street. In 2008, Gordon hosted a Christmas reception, attended by a large number of Christian leaders, to celebrate the success of the churches' Hope08 initiative. He also hosted a reception with Faithworks to celebrate local church-based initiatives, and another to mark the Global Day of Prayer. Since 2008, the Labour party has published the Churches Update newsletter, which has featured regular contributions from senior government ministers. The most recent edition has just been published and can be viewed on the Labour's faith web page. Stephen Timms MP Labour, East Ham, and Labour party vice-chair for faith groups \u2022 It is rather disingenuous on the part of Andrew Marr to say that he sought a superinjunction \"to protect his family\" (Report, 27 April). Methinks, rather, that he was trying to protect himself from the inevitable pelting of eggs on his own face. Had he wished to protect his family, perhaps he should have thought, ab initio, of the consequences on his family of his own self-indulgent behaviour.

Colin Challen Scarborough, North Yorkshire \u2022 Here in Barnsley if we asked anybody to dinner (Letters, 28 April) they would turn up at midday, so we always have to give a time. In our schools we have dinner money for dinner tickets and are looked after by dinner ladies. On Christmas Day, before three o'clock, we have Christmas dinner. Can't be doing with all these southern lunches. Roy Carr Barnsley \u2022 According to your science correspondent, Seti senior astronomer Seth Shostack needs $7m to continue his work (If the aliens call, 27 April). Has he thought of selling seashells on the seashore? Colin Crouch Bognor Regis, Sussex"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
