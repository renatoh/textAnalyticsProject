But is is strangely quiet as shopkeepers lounge behind their wares, many of them chewing away furiously at a green wad the size of a golfball. Drivers with bulging cheeks negotiate the narrow streets picking at plastic bags of leaves, sipping water to combat dehydration or sweet fizzy drinks to take away the bitter taste of qat \u2014 a national pastime and part of the landscape of this beautiful country. But as consumption increases and the effects of the global food crisis kick in, attention is starting to focus on the huge damage this habit is doing to a desperately poor people with limited resources of land and water. Seventy percent of all households report at least one user; one in seven of the workforce is involved in production, transport or sale. Qat makes up a third of all Yemeni agriculture. \"I spend 1,000 riyals every a day on qat, and I earn about 4,000,\" says Hamid from Ta'iz, Yemen's second city. Amin, a journalist, admits to chewing every day. Others indulge only a couple of times a week. But government ministers, officials and businessmen often chew as much as the simplest people. Qat chews can take place on a grimy pavement or in a smart diwan equipped with comfortable cushions and water-pipes. \"It helps me relax,\" explains one habitual user. \"It's like having a couple of beers,\" says another. Qat is an amphetamine-like stimulant that is banned or restricted by many other countries. Users say chewing the leaves of this spindly shrub encourages conversation and sociability, though this wanes at \"Solomon's hour\", a time of introspection often accompanied by the playing of the oud. A session might last for three or four hours, after which chewers spit out their wads of qat mulch and go home. Users can become psychologically dependent but it is not considered addictive. Fares Sanabani, editor of Yemen Today magazine and an aide to President Ali Abdullah Salih, always has a story to tell or something to contribute when he goes to a chew. \"I'm sad that it's there but I enjoy the culture,\" he admits. \"We have chews where we listen to music or talk politics. But I don't want my staff to chew. I don't want them to waste their money, especially if they don't have very much.\" Until the 1960s qat chewing was an occasional pastime for the elite. But it is now deeply engrained, a product, ironically, of the rapid growth of wealth in the 1970s and 1980s. Abdel-Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister, now holds qat chews very infrequently. But the minister of religious affairs offered me the choicest leaves when I went to see him at his Sana'a home recently. The Quran and the hadith do not offer unequivocal guidance. Social pressure is the main reason so many Yemenis chew. \"The decision not to use qat is not equivalent to the decision to decline drinks at a dinner party,\" wrote Branko Milanovic, who studied the phenomenon for the World Bank. \"It is much more important because it excludes the person from social contacts that are necessary for his business or private life.\" If corruption is the country's political glue, commented another foreign student of Yemen, qat is its \"social glue\". Tim Mackintosh-Smith, a British writer and veteran resident of Sana'a, dismisses as \"quasi-scientific poppycock\" the suggestion that chewers are \"at best profligates, at worst irretrievable sinners\". The so-called \"curse of Yemen\" has certainly not impaired his ability to write with huge empathy and erudition about this remote and extraordinary corner of south Arabia. The leaf, he insists, helps users to \"think, work, and study\". To some, qat makes sense economically. Like poppies in Afghanistan, qat is a high-value and resilient crop that regularly produces good returns for growers. But the result is that it has taken over the most productive arable land and displaced food crops that used to be grown for local consumption or for export (including the legendary Mocha coffee), boosting dependence on imported staples. The price of wheat has doubled or more in recent months. Another downside is that qat cultivation consumes a staggering 20% of Yemen's already scarce water\u2014 cheap to pump with subidised diesel fuel. Government ministers say openly that reducing fuel subsidies would be the most effective way to discourage qat growing. And the health risks are indisputable: the use of fertilisers and pesticides to increase crop yields can cause cancers of the mouth and digestive system. Qat is also an appetite suppressant. For poor families \u2014 in a country where half the population (growing at one of the fastest rates in the world) lives on less than $2 per day \u2014 spending on qat means less to spend on food. The World Bank says its consumption requires about 10% of the household budget for all income groups. Malnutrition is already rife and famine is now seen as a real danger. \"It's got to the stage where foreign donors say the government needs to choose between qat and food,\" warns Khaled al-Mulad, director of the Yemen branch of the Islamic Relief charity. Some say the taboo on talking about qat has been broken, though official attempts to discourage its use have met little success. Several NGOs are now trying. No-one believes an outright ban could work \u2014 if only because chewing is not harmful enough. Parents of children at one Sana'a school complained when their offspring came home to tell them qat was a bad thing: the education programme was shut down. Qat is banned in the security forces but it is common to see police and soldiers chewing, even, disconcertingly, when on guard duty. Hotels and companies catering to foreigners have enforced a ban on pain of fines or dismissal. Even President Salih announced that he was reducing his consumption. One American diplomat faced a terrible ordeal when he had to go on local TV to explain that qat users would not be granted immigrant visas to the US because the leaf was classified as a drug. For Abdel-Rahman al-Eryani, Yemen's minister of water and the environment, this year's food crisis has come as a wake-up call, though he fears it may already be too late. \"Qat is a drug, even if every Yemeni will fight you if you say that. It has all the symptoms. It's a cash crop that is part of a vicious cycle of internal bleeding. People in this country are simply chewing their way to oblivion.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
