Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, a deputy prime minister and chief government spokesman, said on Monday that the Dutch ambassador, who is on leave, would not be allowed to return in response to a ban on Turkish ministers speaking at rallies in the Netherlands. Turkey would also close its airspace to Dutch diplomats, Kursulmu\u015f said, adding: \u201cThere is a crisis and a very deep one. We didn\u2019t create this crisis or bring to this stage \u2026 Those creating this crisis are responsible for fixing it.\u201d The spokesman\u2019s remarks came hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan defied pleas from Brussels to tone down his rhetoric, repeating accusations of European \u201cnazism\u201d and warning that his ministers would take their treatment by the Dutch to the European court of human rights. Erdo\u011fan also accused Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel of \u201csupporting terrorists\u201d and criticised her for backing the Dutch in the row over Turkish campaigning abroad before an April referendum on controversial plans to expand his powers. \u201cMrs Merkel, why are you hiding terrorists in your country? \u2026 Why are you not doing anything?\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in an interview with Turkish television. He added that the position adopted by the Dutch and a number of other EU states amounted to nazism. \u201cWe can call this neo-nazism. A new nazism tendency.\u201d Merkel had earlier pledged her \u201cfull support and solidarity\u201d to the Dutch, saying allegations made twice by Erdo\u011fan this weekend that the Dutch government was acting like Nazis were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. The Turkish remarks followed a request on Monday by the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and enlargement commissioner, Johannes Hahn, for Ankara to \u201crefrain from excessive statements and actions\u201d. It was \u201cessential to avoid further escalation and find ways to calm down the situation\u201d, the two said in a joint statement. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, urged all concerned to \u201cshow mutual respect and be calm\u201d. Turkey\u2019s minister for EU affairs, \u00d6mer \u00c7elik, said sanctions against the Netherlands were now likely. \u201cWe will surely have sanctions against the latest actions by the Netherlands. We will answer them with these,\u201d he said. The Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozda\u011f, said the country would \u201cnot allow anyone to play with the honour of the Turkish nation and Turkish state\u201d, while Nurettin Canikli, a deputy prime minister, described Europe as a \u201cvery sick man\u201d. The threat made by Kurtulmu\u015f to re-evaluate the deal the EU signed with Ankara in March 2016 that has successfully curbed migration from Turkey to Greece, then onward into the rest of the bloc, will be seen as particularly alarming. Dutch police used dogs and water cannon on Sunday to disperse demonstrators after Turkey\u2019s family minister, Fatma Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya, was escorted out of the country and the foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, denied permission to land. The ministers were due to address a rally for some of the 400,000 Turks living in the Netherlands, many of whom are able to vote in the 16 April referendum. Daan Feddo Huisinga, the Dutch charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ankara, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday to receive formal protests over the \u201cdisproportionate, inhumane and humiliating\u201d treatment of the protesters and the improper reception given to the ministers. The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland \u2013 all of which have large Turkish immigrant communities \u2013 have cited security and other concerns as reasons not to allow Turkish officials to campaign in their countries. But with as many as 1.4 million Turkish voters in Germany alone, Erdo\u011fan cannot afford to ignore the foreign electorate. The standoff has further strained relations already frayed over human rights, while repeated indications from Erdo\u011fan that he could personally try to address rallies in EU countries risk further inflaming the situation. The row also looks likely to dim further Turkey\u2019s prospects of joining the EU, a process that has been under way for more than 50 years. \u201cThe formal end of accession negotiations with Turkey now looks inevitable,\u201d the German commentator Daniel Br\u00f6ssler wrote in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Austria\u2019s chancellor, Christian Kern, called on Monday for an EU-wide ban on Turkish rallies, saying it would take pressure off individual countries. But Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, said that while accession talks could be halted, he had doubts as to whether the bloc should collectively decide on a rally ban. Analysts said the Turkish president was using the crisis to show voters that his strong leadership was needed against a Europe he routinely presents as hostile. Erdo\u011fan is \u201clooking for \u2018imagined\u2019 foreign enemies to boost his nationalist base in the run-up to the referendum,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Programme at the Washington Institute. Marc Pierini, the EU\u2019s former envoy to Turkey, said he saw no immediate solution to the crisis because \u201cthe referendum outcome in Turkey is very tight and the leadership will do everything to ramp up the nationalist narrative to garner more votes\u201d. In the medium term, Pierini said: \u201cOne can hope the fever will subside. Yet bridges have been burned at a personal level: using a \u2018nazi\u2019 narrative is extreme \u2026 and will probably prevent any summit meeting between the EU and Turkey for a while.\u201d Erdo\u011fan last week accused Germany of \u201cNazi practices\u201d after \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu was banned from speaking at a rally in Hamburg. The Turkish president twice made the same claim of the Dutch on Saturday, describing them as \u201cNazi remnants\u201d and telling a rally in Istanbul: \u201cI thought nazism was over, but I was wrong. In fact, nazism is alive in the west.\u201d Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who faces a strong far-right challenge in this week\u2019s parliamentary elections and showed little desire to appease Turkey, demanded an apology for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d jibe. Denmark has also postponed a planned visit next weekend by the Turkish prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, saying the meeting could not be seen as \u201cseparate from the current Turkish attacks on Holland\u201d. European states are not entirely united: \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu himself called off a planned visit to Switzerland, despite the Swiss federal government saying there was \u201cnothing to justify\u201d cancelling it, after Zurich police expressed security concerns. The French government also allowed \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu to address a rally in Metz on Sunday, but was strongly criticised by opposition politicians, who accused it of \u201cflagrantly breaking with European solidarity\u201d on the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
