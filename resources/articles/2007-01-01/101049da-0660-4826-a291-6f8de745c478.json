And when the initial look of shock fades to one of slack-mouthed confusion, slap them again. They are incredibly wrong and need to be reprogrammed. A fortnight ago, comedy conservative Boris Johnson used his column in the Telegraph to launch a vociferous attack on videogames. Under the headline \"Games rot our children's brains\", he blundered: \"It is about time, as a society, that we admitted the catastrophic effect these blasted gizmos are having on the literacy and the prospects of young males.\" Quite apart from the fact that no one has used the phrase \"blasted gizmos\" since the 1948 book Biggles and the New Radar Equipment, he ignores the masses of research that suggests child literacy problems start way before kids even pick up a joypad and that their attitudes to reading are influenced most importantly by their parents. He also ignores, or more likely has never heard about, the many thousands of families who spent Christmas laughing and competing together thanks to the likes of Wii Sports, SingStar and Guitar Hero. The zombified, isolated youngsters of his outdated imagination don't fit well with what I have seen: generations gathered together fighting over Wiimotes rather than TV remotes - chatting, shouting and singing rather than slumping in silence, staring goggle-eyed at whatever visual slurry the nation's broadcasters had seen fit to label family entertainment. Of course, it is a little daft to get worked up over the pompous scribblings of an out-of-touch Tory - Boris writing in the Telegraph is pretty much the blind leading the blind as far as cultural enlightenment goes. More annoying, perhaps, was the recent news that the controversial independent videogame, Super Columbine RPG, was withdrawn from the Slamdance Film Festival's Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition - on moral grounds, according to the event's president, Peter Baxter. This is the movie festival set up 13 years ago by those who felt Sundance had failed to showcase the edgier work of offbeat indie filmmakers. Super Columbine RPG is apparently the first work to be withdrawn in that period. Sure, this freeware title, an attempt to investigate and satirise the Columbine massacre through the uncomfortable framework of a traditional RPG (role playing game), is often confused and tawdry. But it symbolises a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than \"shoot the enemies and pick up health\". Doubtless, the interactive element, together with the very word \"game\" and all the connotations it carries, muddy the water somewhat for those who seek to explore real-world themes through the format. But, for God's sake, those responsible for a supposedly progressive arts festival should understand the incredible possibilities of interactive media to educate, inform and challenge in fresh, engaging ways. This isn't even a new idea - Monopoly, of course, has its roots in The Landlord's Game, developed in the first years of the 20th century to show how the economics of rented accommodation impoverished tenants. Newsflash: videogames are still misunderstood and maligned in 2007 - no matter how much money they're making, no matter how many suited soulless freaks try to turn them into franchise properties. So buckle up, people, we're looking at many more years of this. It's not over 'til the fat Tory plays. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
