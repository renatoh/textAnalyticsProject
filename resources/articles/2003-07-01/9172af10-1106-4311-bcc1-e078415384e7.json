He was on target with Macadamia at his local meeting on Wednesday and was unlucky not to follow up with Inverness yesterday. Torosay Spring, who ran so well for the stable in the Wokingham Handicap, can spark an across-the-card double today for Fanshawe, who has good prospects at Ascot with Vindication. Sixth behind dead-heaters Fayr Jag and Ratio in the big handicap at Royal Ascot, Torosay Spring (3.05) looks next in line to frank that form in the Cuisine De France Summer Stakes at York. The Tatling, Capricho and Patavellian, third, fourth and fifth in the Wokingham, all won next time out. Torosay Spring was only a neck behind yesterday's all-the-way Bunbury Cup winner Patavellian at the line after coming with a dangerous looking run on the near side. That stiff six furlongs may just have been beyond the mare, who has a clear-cut chance back against rivals of her own sex in this Group 3 contest. Vindication (3.15) , touched off by the improved Tora Bora over seven furlongs at Leicester, can benefit from stronger handling and the drop to sprinting in the Rendezvous Casino Rated Stakes at Ascot. Conrad Allen's Weecandoo (5.00) should go well here aftter her fine third at Sandown from way out of the handicap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
