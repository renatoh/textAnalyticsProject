They are part of a small, growing group of people in politics, the arts and sports who are becoming doctors again to help health care systems under unprecedented strain. Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, has offered to work one day a week as a doctor as his country braces for a surge in the number of infections, it emerged this week. \u201cMany of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way,\u201d said a spokesperson. Varadkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier. His return to medicine adds him to an eclectic group of public figures who have dusted off credentials to work as nurses and doctors in Europe\u2019s battle against the pandemic. Coronavirus has made thousands of frontline health care workers ill and left many others unable to work because they need to stay at home to care for children or self-isolate because of potential infection. Health services across the continent have appealed to trainees, retirees and expatriates \u2013 anyone with useful skills \u2013 to help fill the gap. For Thomas Lilti, 43, a film director and showrunner, was filming the French medical TV drama Hippocrate in a hospital when the pandemic struck. He suspended filming and a few days later started working as a doctor \u2013 a profession he had quit in 2014 \u2013 in the same hospital. \u201cI volunteered in casualty to try and help in a small way so the more competent doctors, those who really know what they are doing, can have a rest even if just for a few hours,\u201d he told Le Journal du Dimanche. French sports figures have also reverted to former professions. St\u00e9phanie dos Santos, 28, a basketballer, and Julien Mathieu, a ju-jitsu champion, are working as nurses. Thomas Carabas, 31, a rugby referee, has returned to work at Bayonne hospital. Politicians across Europe \u2013 and the political spectrum \u2013 have also responded. Katalin Cseh, 31, an MEP for Hungary\u2019s opposition Momentum party, has returned from Brussels to Budapest and is to start her first shift as a volunteer medic on Tuesday. Cseh expressed concern about Hungary\u2019s low level of testing and potential abuse of a new law against misinformation but volunteered \u201cto show a good example\u201d, she said. She will work part-time and unpaid while continuing to serve as an MEP. In France, Thomas Mesnier, 34, an MP for the governing La R\u00e9publique en Marche, has returned to hospital work. Caroline Fiat, 43, an MP for La France Insoumise, has returned to work as a nurse. Bernard Jomier, 56, a Socialist party senator, and V\u00e9ronique Guillotin, 57, a Radical Movement senator, have returned to the medical profession as doctors. In Northern Ireland, Kathryn Owen, 42, a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) councillor, is to resume working as a nurse this week at a hospital site that treats coronavirus patients. John Kyle, 68, a Progressive Unionist party (PUP) councillor, has come out of retirement as a GP despite being close to an at-risk age group. \u201cFear and powerlessness reinforce each other and I thought that taking action to join the army of healthcare workers combating the virus would help me handle those feelings,\u201d Kyle said via email. \u201cMy medical instincts of wanting to help the ill and suffering were also reactivated and so volunteering seemed a natural response.\u201d His family is supportive but worries given his age, he said. \u201cI think it is the right thing to do \u2026 But fears can raise their ugly head in the middle of the night.\u201d Varadkar rejoined Ireland\u2019s medical register last month and has offered to help in areas within his competence, said a spokesperson for the taoiseach\u2019s office. Brendan O\u2019Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student, remembers him as competent and effective in his hospital jobs, training practices and GP co-operative work. \u201cHe got on very well with patients and colleagues, and was regarded as a good team player.\u201d Varadkar, said O\u2019Shea, once remarked that as a doctor people believed everything you said, but as a politician nobody believed a word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
