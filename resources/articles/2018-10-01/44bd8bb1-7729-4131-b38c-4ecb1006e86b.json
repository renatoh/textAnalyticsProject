Police in the city estimated that about 180,000 people took part in a rally in the city on Monday evening. Tensions flared between police and protesters as some hardline demonstrators jumped over barriers at the entrance to the parliament. There were similar scenes outside the Barcelona headquarters of Spain\u2019s national police. Crowds of students filled the city\u2019s central square on Monday afternoon, waving yellow, red and blue separatist flags and chanting \u201c1 October, no forgiving, no forgetting\u201d. Nearby, others let off smoke bombs and fireworks. The huge rallies came after members of the grassroots Committees for the Defence of the Republic occupied streets in Barcelona and Lleida and the motorways to Madrid and France. They also obstructed the train line between Figueres, Girona and Barcelona but services were restored by 10am local time. In Girona, protesters stormed a government office, tearing down the Spanish flag and replacing it with the pro-independence estelada (starred) banner. Catalonia\u2019s nationalist president, Quim Torra, made a symbolic visit to a polling station in the small town of Sant Juli\u00e0 de Ramis, where police prevented his predecessor Carles Puigdemont from voting last October. Speaking on Monday morning, Torra had urged the protesters to \u201ckeep up the pressure\u201d. \u201cEverything began on 1 October and everything goes back to 1 October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lesson of 1 October and its values are what we need as we face the coming weeks and months.\u201d In a video message released on Monday, Puigdemont said: \u201cLet us not stray from the only possible way to live in a full democracy: the [Catalan] republic and its international recognition.\u201d Puigdemont later criticised the protesters who forced their way into the regional parliament, tweeting: \u201cIf they\u2019re wearing hoods, they aren\u2019t 1 October people. If they use violence, they aren\u2019t 1 October people. We did it with our faces uncovered and in a peaceful way. That is how, a year ago, we overcame an authoritarian state.\u201d Torra\u2019s call for continued direct action had led Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, to remind the Catalan president of his official duties. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep trying to reduce tensions and maintain dialogue, and ask everyone to fulfil their responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cOrder means order, and public order in Catalonia has to be guaranteed by the Catalan government, which is led by Mr Torra.\u201d Catalonia remains deeply divided over the issue of independence a year after Puigdemont\u2019s administration staged the vote in defiance of the Spanish government. The referendum was marred by violence as officers from the Guardia Civil and national police stormed polling stations, beat voters with batons and fired rubber bullets. The central government responded to the subsequent unilateral declaration of independence by sacking Puigdemont and his cabinet, taking control of the wealthy north-eastern region and calling a snap regional election. Although pro-independence parties retained their majority in last December\u2019s vote, the staunchly unionist Citizens party took the most seats and polls suggest Catalans are evenly split over whether to secede. The new socialist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez has taken a more conciliatory approach than the conservative government it replaced, offering a vote on increased self-government but categorically ruling out a referendum on self-determination or independence. Cracks have appeared in the independence movement, with moderate figures calling for a more realistic, long-term strategy to achieve a sovereign republic, while Puigdemont and Torra advocate pushing ahead with what they see as their mandate from the referendum. In last year\u2019s poll, 90% of those who voted opted for independence, but turnout was 42% as unionist Catalans boycotted the poll. However, the biggest obstacle to negotiations is the continuing detention of nine Catalan independence leaders who are due to be tried early next year for their roles in the push for secession. Puigdemont fled to Belgium days after declaring independence and several other pro-independence politicians remain in self-imposed exile. Spanish government ministers have acknowledged that it would be better if the jailed leaders were allowed out on bail, but have stressed that it is a judicial question rather than a political one. On Saturday, 24 people were injured and six arrested in Barcelona after scuffles broke out at a rally held to honour the police deployed to prevent the referendum.
