The advice is that there is nothing finer for lifting the spirits if the weather turns nasty than pulling on a pair of dry socks. The festival is famous for mud, which in 2005 turned into six feet of water and flooded hundreds of tents after torrential downpours of rain. The event at Worthy Farm, Pilton in Somerset is now one of the UK Climate Impact Programme's case studies for the West Country on how to adapt to climate change. In 2005 the downpour was described as a one in a hundred year storm but, as the case study points out, there were six such storms at Glastonbury in that year alone. Robert Kearle, the festival's environmental manager, who had to sort out the problem, said the organisers were lucky nobody drowned. As a result of this problem Glastonbury might have lost its licence to hold further festivals, so a lot of money was spent to adapt to \"freak\" events that are becoming normal. The size of the drains was tripled, hollows that flooded were filled in, roads were modified and altogether the site adapted as much as possible for \"heatwaves, intense rainfall or storms.\" This year, after a record dry spring the weather has changed back to \"normal\" \u2013 if that can be said of British summers any longer. Either way, Glastonbury, with its huge drains, is ready for anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
