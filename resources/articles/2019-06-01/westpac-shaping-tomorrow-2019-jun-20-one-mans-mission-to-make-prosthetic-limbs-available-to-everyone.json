Following Bowtell\u2019s redundancy from the Altona Toyota factory in 2017, the 36-year-old engineer chose to make the most of the situation and prepare for the next stage of his career \u2013 and life. Though he had been approached with a number of lucrative job offers, Bowtell\u2019s true motivation was his passion for giving. Bowtell creates prosthetic limbs - and distributes them worldwide, for free. Many years before Bowtell\u2019s major career change, he tried on a bionic arm while studying mechatronics in Japan as part of his engineering degree. He was told the arm had cost US$1 million to make, and, as impressive as the technology was, something about that price tag didn\u2019t sit quite right with the young student. Fast forward several years, and Bowtell secured himself a position as a lean engineer at Toyota, where it was his job to ensure that processes at the factory ran efficiently and effectively. In his spare time though, Bowtell had picked up an unusual hobby. He\u2019d started using 3D printers to make prosthetic hands. He\u2019d remained fascinated by prostheses ever since that initial study trip. And when the popularity of 3D printers really began to boom, he\u2019d held true to his lean engineer mindset and set about getting that price-tag down. Of course, what also drew Bowtell to this mission was his strong sense of generosity. \u201cEach and every one of us has some sort of skill we can use to help others. For me, I have always enjoyed making things for other people,\u201d he says. Bowtell made his first 3D printed hand in 2015, and since then, his mission has grown exponentially. Just a week after his final day at Toyota, he was selected as a finalist for the Australian of the Year awards. This was a significant turning point for Bowtell. With the nomination came an influx of media attention. He was overwhelmed, not just with requests for help, but with offers of support. \u201cEvery day we still get people turning up wanting to volunteer. We\u2019ve got retirees, high school students, locals, as well as people I\u2019ve never met before. It\u2019s just fantastic.\u201d Over the years this support has continued to grow, and Bowtell has sought to develop his love of giving into a culture which benefits his entire community. \u201cI grew up on Phillip Island but moved away for uni and work - I moved back because it is such an embracing community,\u201d he says. \u201cI really feel now that everyone here is embracing and supporting what I am doing and is helping me make it grow. In connecting the community like this, we can all feel what I feel when I make these hands.\u201d In applying for the Westpac Social Change Fellowship, he sought an opportunity to grow his one-man backyard project into a global initiative. He moved out of his workshop in the single garage attached to his rented home, and into a large factory. The space is complete with a dedicated 3D printing room and a treasured \u2018Wall of Gratitude\u2019, which shares the name of each and every donor and volunteer. Today, every prosthetic hand is pieced together by a volunteer on the \u2018Just-In-Time\u2019 production line, where assembly takes around three hours. \u201cThe final step in the process is the writing of a personalised letter from the volunteer to the recipient. The volunteer gets the ownership of that satisfaction that comes with seeing a photo of the child trying on their hand for the first time. As a Westpac Social Change Fellow, Bowtell has been able to travel across the world to develop his expertise and collaborate with innovative and like-minded people. He has attended 3D printing conferences in the UK and Germany, completed a short internship at the world-famous Ortos prosthetics clinic in Denmark, and exchanged tips with renowned orthopaedic surgeon and bionic developer Dr Albert Chi in the US. Throughout Australia, he\u2019s met with families and individuals from across the limb-difference community, learning about differences in accessibility and support. \u201cForming all those connections with people around the world is what has really helped me take this to the next level,\u201d Bowtell says. \u201cWith the fellowship, I received funding to develop a plan to network, collaborate and learn, but it was worth so much more than that monetary value.\u201d The spirit of Bowtell\u2019s generosity extends far beyond the Australian and international recipients of his 3D hands, and the Phillip Island community. His vision and reach is global. Not only does Bowtell give his hands away, all of his designs are available online for free download, too. \u201cMaking things open source is the only way you can decentralise the technology. I want to be able to create things that people can modify and repair themselves wherever they are in the world, as well as to make their own.\u201d One of Bowtell\u2019s designs, the kinetic finger, has been downloaded 3,000 times. \u201cA partial finger replacement usually costs around $6,500 \u2013 so that\u2019s roughly equivalent to $18 million in value. I could never have made all of those myself \u2013 by making things open source, you are able to reach out in a very big way.\u201d The far-reaching impact of Bowtell\u2019s work continues to be acknowledged right across the globe. Only last month, he was humbled to have been recognised by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as the 94th Commonwealth Point of Light. \u201cMat epitomises the best of our Commonwealth values and this award is recognition of that and the contribution he is making to society,\u201d says Vicki Treadell, The British High Commissioner to Australia. Bowtell\u2019s future has gone from uncertainty to a crystal-clear mission. What began as a philanthropic hobby is now a fully registered charity, Free 3D Hands, with unlimited potential.
