Donald Trump hailed Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union this morning, telling reporters in Scotland: \u201cThey took back control of their country. It\u2019s a great thing.\u201d Trump, visiting Scotland for a ribbon-cutting at one of his golf courses, pointed out that he had called for the Brexit while Obama had opposed it, and he said the vote could foretell his election as president. \u201cI think I see a big parallel \u2013 people want to take their country back,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you traveling with foreign policy advisers?\u201d Trump was asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with them,\u201d he replied \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing to talk about ... ultimately I think it will be a good thing.\u201d Hillary Clinton released a statement on the Brexit, saying \u201cWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made.\u201d \u201cThis time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House,\u201d Clinton said. The statement calls for protection for working families from economic uncertainty and attests to \u201cAmerica\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain\u201d. President Barack Obama said that the special relationship is enduring, and \u201cthe United Kingdom\u2019s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone.\u201d In a statement, the president declared that \u201cthe United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship.\u201d Reminder: A few weeks ago, Donald Trump did not know what \u201cBrexit\u201d meant. Former treasury secretary and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Hank Paulson, a Republican, has endorsed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, writing in an op-ed for the Washington Post that Donald Trump \u201cpopulist hijacking of one of the United States\u2019 great political parties.\u201d \u201cThe GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism,\u201d Paulson wrote. \u201cThis troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to put country before party and say it together: Never Trump.\u201d Bernie Sanders crossed a verbal watershed in his slow march toward conceding the Democratic nomination contest by confirming he would vote for Clinton in November\u2019s election. \u201cYes \u2013 I think the issue right here is, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders told CNN. Despite previous assurances that he would work with her to defeat Donald Trump, the remarks are the first time the leftwing Vermont senator has explicitly supported his Democratic adversary. That\u2019s it from the campaign trail! Former treasury secretary and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Hank Paulson, a Republican, has endorsed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, writing in an op-ed for the Washington Post that Donald Trump \u201cpopulist hijacking of one of the United States\u2019 great political parties.\u201d \u201cThe GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism,\u201d Paulson wrote. \u201cThis troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to put country before party and say it together: Never Trump.\u201d Paulson, who presided over the subprime mortgage crisis that eventually ignited a global economic meltdown, wrote in the Washington Post that Trump\u2019s record as a businessman is not a qualification so much as a liability: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical.\u201d \u201cWhen Trump assures us he\u2019ll do for the United States what he\u2019s done for his businesses, that\u2019s not a promise - it\u2019s a threat.\u201d The New York bar where a police raid and ensuing riot gave birth to the gay rights movement in the US will be the site of the Stonewall National Monument, writes the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters: Barack Obama has announced that the Stonewall National Monument will be created outside the Stonewall Inn in New York where gay men, lesbians and drag queens reacted to a police raid in 1969 with a riot that spread and turned into the gay rights movement in America and around the world. Obama confirmed the widely expected news that he was designating the first ever national monument to the LGBT equality movement as many cities around the US are preparing for their annual Pride parades this weekend, while still mourning the massacre of 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando less than two weeks ago. \u201cThe riots became protests, the protests became a movement, the movement ultimately became an integral part of America,\u201d Obama said in a voiceover to a video released on Friday that includes the faces and voices of activists from both the Stonewall era and today. He declared Stonewall the newest addition to the National Park system, which \u201cshould reflect the full story of our country. That we are stronger together,\u201d he said. The tiny public garden opposite the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, has been officially declared part of the site of the new national monument, which also covers the surrounding streets and the bar itself, which has been protected and preserved as a National Historic Landmark since 2000. Obama issued a statement on Friday describing the park as \u201ca place for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community to assemble for marches and parades, expressions of grief and anger, and celebrations of victory and joy\u201d. Bernie Sanders said this afternoon he is in talks with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to come up with some \u201cserious proposals\u201d to help \u201ctransform America.\u201d He made the comments during a speech in Albany, New York. Earlier in the day, Sanders said he would vote for Clinton to stop Republican candidate Donald Trump from winning the White House, a show of support that his campaign said was not a formal endorsement. Richard Haass, former director of policy planning for the State Department, where he was a principal advisor to Secretary Colin Powell, told reporters: \u201cThe UK has been one of this country\u2019s most important partners. It will be less willing and able to play that role and the net result will be the special relationship will be that much less special.\u201d \u201cThe United States will have no alternative but to increasingly turn to and rely on other countries. So this is essentially a cloud without a silver lining when it comes to the UK itself economically and politically, when it comes to Europe or when it comes to the United States. On balance, this will diminish order in Europe and arguably beyond.\u201d Haass, now president of the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations, described David Cameron\u2019s decision to hold a referendum as \u201cone of history\u2019s great blunders\u201d. Britain will be divided, poorer and distracted, he warned, diminishing its role in Europe. The vote marks the beginning of the dissolution of one of the principal countries in the world, he said, with a knock-on effect of more referenda in other European countries. \u201cI do believe the effects will be deep and enduring. I would say the biggest loser will be the UK itself. Actually, at the risk of sounding melodramatic, I do believe that this is the beginning of the end of the United Kingdom.\u201d He explained: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of when and not if Scotland has a second referendum and this time it will almost certainly pass, based on the argument that it is more important to be in Europe than in the UK. I also worry that pressure will grow in Northern Ireland for a referendum on essentially whether it should unify with Ireland, and I believe that the politics surrounding that will deepen the divisions in Northern Ireland and the consequences of that could be more than serious for the stability that has been so carefully cultivated in Northern Ireland over the last two decades and I believe could be jeopardised.\u201d Richard Grenell, former spokesman for President George W Bush at the UN, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that people everywhere are finished with elite institutions advocating the status quo. Brexit is only the beginning. People are fed up and can\u2019t be scared into submission. They are no longer afraid of being called a racist or homophobe. \u201cWe want politicians to listen to us and the ones that don\u2019t will be thrown out of office. America\u2019s relationship with the UK will be stronger as soon as Obama leaves office. While Obama won\u2019t move to help strengthen our economic and security ties, the next president will.\u201d Dean Baker, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, said: \u201cI was certainly surprised. I assumed that the experts were right that it would be close, but stay would win. However to me, this shows the anger that comes with failed economic policies. Clearly xenophobia and racism were major factors, but does anyone think the UK would have voted to leave if growth had averaged 2.5-3% over the last decade rather less than 1% in the UK and near zero in the EU?\u201d Baker suggested that Brexit could strengthen, not weaken, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d across the Atlantic. \u201cPresumably it makes the UK even closer with the US, especially if the EU is trying to punish the UK. A lot will depend on whether the EU leadership acts like mature adults or a spurned lover.\u201d Former half-term Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has compared the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to the Declaration of Independence, writing in a Facebook post this afternoon that she hopes the UK\u2019s \u201crefreshed spirit of sovereignty spread over the pond to America\u2019s shores!\u201d In a post accompanied by a photograph of late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Palin offered \u201ccongratulations\u201d to \u201csmart Brits.\u201d \u201cGood on you for ignoring all the fear mongering from special interest globalists who tend to aim for that apocalyptic One World Government that dissolves a nation\u2019s self-determination and sovereignty... the EU being a One World Government mini-me,\u201d Palin wrote. Echoing presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Palin wrote that \u201cAmerica can learn an encouraging lesson from this.\u201d \u201cIt is time to dissolve political bands that connect us to agendas not in our best interest,\u201d Palin concluded. \u201cMay UN shackles be next on the chopping block.\u201d In an email to supporters, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump applauded the millions of British voters who \u201cchose to leave the flawed and failing European Union and reassert control over their borders, politics and economy, taking a brave stand for freedom and independence\u201d - and encouraged his followers to follow their example. \u201cThese voters stood up for their nation,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWith your help, we\u2019re going to do the exact same thing on Election Day 2016 here in the United States of America.\u201d Asking for donations for his putatively self-funded campaign, Trump wrote his supporters that \u201cvoters here face the same choice\u201d as British voters in yesterday\u2019s referendum. \u201cLet\u2019s send another shockwave around the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLet\u2019s take back our country from the corrupt career politicians and put Americans first. Let\u2019s re-declare our independence.\u201d Journalists at CNN aren\u2019t the only ones miffed with the cable news network\u2019s hiring of controversial former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski - even the network\u2019s main competition is voicing displeasure with the move. Lost in the shuffle of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union last night, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly rattled off a long list of perceived offenses committed by Lewandowski. \u201cThis is the same guy who has threatened more than one journalist in the course of this campaign, has had some very ugly language attributed to him when it comes to women, and now he will be getting paid by Donald Trump one day and by CNN the next,\u201d Kelly said. Noting that Lewandowski had signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump, Kelly declared that any analysis Lewandowski will provide as a commentator will be tainted. \u201cIt\u2019s not honest analysis,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThink about the CNN reporter, the one who he threatened. I hope they don\u2019t bump into each other in the green room. That\u2019s going to be awkward. It\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will have little bearing on Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House in November, writes Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs: But the American and British electorates are so different that it is impossible to productively compare the two. The biggest difference is that the UK is a lot whiter. According to the most recent census data, 86% of the British population is white. In the US, only 63% is non-Hispanic white. A recent national poll from the Washington Post and ABC News showed that non-white voters viewed Trump with almost unprecedented levels of disdain. Only 4% of black voters and 11% of Hispanic voters had a favorable view of him. Another national poll, from Monmouth, showed Trump to have the support of a mere 17% of black, Hispanic and Asian voters. In the UK, minority voters were overwhelmingly for staying in the European Union. Polling data from Lord Ashcroft shows that two thirds of Asian voters and nearly three quarters of black voters supported the Remain campaign. It was just that the electorate wasn\u2019t diverse enough for this to make a difference. In the US, it is anticipated that more than 30% of voters in the presidential election will be members of a minority group. The Brexit vote looked a lot more like that in a Republican presidential primary. There are other differences. A US presidential election, for example, is a fierce and partisan campaign in which tribal loyalties span generations. In the EU referendum, the British electorate splintered across party lines. Read the full piece here. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true? Where\u2019s the part where he denies any wrongdoing or tries to blame somebody else? This is absolutely crazy. The Clinton camp hits Trump with a quickie video ad mashing up TV news describing economic tremors tied to the Brexit with footage of Trump at his news conference Friday in Scotland. \u201cGolfers will stop, and they\u2019ll go and get something to eat, and then they\u2019ll go on to the tenth hole,\u201d Trump says. He refers to Scotland as \u201cFlorida\u201d. We\u2019re not sure whether the pun at the end was necessary. \u201cDonald Trump: in it fore himself\u201d. Barack Obama is speaking at the global entrepreneurship summit at Stanford University. He began his remarks by saying he spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron and that the U.K. is committed to an orderly transition out of EU. Obama says he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d that will happen. He also has spoken with German chancellor Angela Merkel, he said. Bernie Sanders is in Albany to deliver a recapitulation of the \u201cWhere we go from here\u201d speech he delivered in NYC last night \u2013 read our live blog coverage here. This morning Sanders told MSNBC he would be voting for Hillary Clinton. Sanders tells his Albany audience that he\u2019s flattered by the T-shirts, but \u201cIt\u2019s not Bernie. It\u2019s you.\u201d It\u2019s not about Bernie or anybody else. It\u2019s about people coming together in a Democratic way to transform this country,\u201d Sanders says. It\u2019s not a we, it\u2019s not a you, it\u2019s an us.\u201d The Daily Beast, citing \u201cindustry gossip\u201d, reports that CNN is paying former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski $500,000 to analyze politics, even though Lewandowski is contractually barred from disparaging Trump. CNN host Erin Burnett asked Lewandowski about his ability to speak freely in an introductory segment Thursday night: \u201cMy confidentiality agreement is such where information that I would be privy to and private conversations that take place between family members that are not meant for the public audience are going to be held in the closest and strictest of confidence with me,\u201d Lewandowski says. [...] \u201cI\u2019m going to tell it like it is because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve had my entire career, and most of the time it has been at my own detriment.\u201d Parody echoes reality echoes parody: \u201cBritain and the US are different countries,\u201d asserts Palmieri, in reply to a question about potential trans-Atlantic implications of the Brexit vote. \u201cWe have real confidence that Americans... believe deeply that we are stronger together,\u201d says Sullivan. He says Americans have \u201cenormous common sense.\u201d They\u2019re going to look at this vote, see what impact it has on the British economy.. they\u2019re going to make their own decision about the kind of leadership they\u2019re looking for. In a conference call with reporters, Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan and communications director Jennifer Palmieri are issuing a damning assessment of Trump\u2019s appearance in Scotland and reaction to the Brexit vote. \u201cAs we can see from the falling markets, the economic uncertainty created by the vote carries a risk of hitting the pokcet books of American families,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cDonald Trump actively rooted for this outcome, and he\u2019s rooting for the economic turmoil in its wake. He said a falling British pound is good for his golf business. He actually put his golf business ahead of working families in the United States.\u201d Sullivan continues: Every time there is a significant national or global event, Donald Trump proves again that he is temperamentally unfit for the job. First, he engages in what can only be described as pathological self-congratulation. Second, rather than consult people who might know what\u2019s happening... he consults only with himself. Third, rather than gets the facts, he just makes them up or makes basic factual errors. Sullivan noted that Trump had tweeted that Scotland was \u201cgoing wild\u201d about the Brexit vote, when Scotland in fact voted to remain. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s just not concerned with the facts,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cFourth, rather than think about what is good for the American people, he thinks and talks about what\u2019s good for himself.\u201d Sullivan quotes Trump as saying, \u201crunning a golf course is just like running a country.\u201d He calls Trump a \u201creckless and erratic egomaniac who could easily drive us off the cliff\u201d and a Trump presidency a \u201cdangerous and frightening prospect\u201d. Palmieri adds: \u201cWhat Donald Trump proved today is that you can change the campaign manager but not the candidate... we saw what happens when he\u2019s taken off Paul Manafort\u2019s teleprompter.\u201d Sarah Palin\u2019s statement on the Brexit, opening with a quote from the Declaration of Independence, takes a cue from the Trump spokeswoman who argued this week that \u201cAmerica is here because of its own little Brexit\u201d: In speeches from Texas to New York, on issues from foreign policy to taxes and guns, Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump has had trouble with the truth. In the first of a regular series, the Guardian looks at some of the tallest tales Trump has told over the past week. \u201cI started off in Brooklyn, New York, not long ago, with a small loan, and built a business which today is worth well over $10bn.\u201d \u2013 22 June, New York City In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 report by a New Jersey regulator also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later hebought $3.5m in gambling chips to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was found to have broken the law by accepting them. Trump alsoborrowed millions against his inheritance before his father\u2019s death, a 2007 deposition shows. [Read further.] \u201cI was among the earliest to criticize the rush to [the Iraq] war, and yes, even before the war ever started.\u201d \u2013 22 June, New York City Trump has repeated this false claim nearly every week for four months. On 11 September 2002, about six months before the invasion, Trump told radio host Howard Stern: \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d when asked whether he supported the proposed war. He offered a similar answer to Fox News a few months later, saying George W Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d. [Read further.] Ewen MacAskill: nasty guy? Let\u2019s go to the tape: Ewen, the Guardian\u2019s defence and intelligence correspondent, pointed out to Trump that no top British politicians wanted to meet him during his Scottish sojourn. \u201cYou said there was a love fest \u2013 David Cameron said he didn\u2019t want to meet you,\u201d Ewen says. \u201cAlex Salmond said he didn\u2019t want to meet you.\u201d \u201cDavid Cameron would have met me. David Cameron was negotiating to meet me,\u201d Trump asserts. \u201cBut right now I don\u2019t think David Cameron wants to meet anybody.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re regarded as toxic,\u201d Ewen observes. \u201cNasty, nasty guy,\u201d Trump says. Comedian Lee Nelson (real name Simon Brodkin) popped up at the Donald Trump appearance at his Turnberry golf course, approached the candidate and handed out golf balls bearing swastikas. \u201cThese are the new balls available from the clubhouse as part of the new Trump Turnberry range. I forgot to hand them out before,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Mr. Trump. And thank you. I apologize.\u201d \u201cGet him out,\u201d Trump said. He was got out. A month ago, Donald Trump did not know what \u201cBrexit\u201d meant. He also rejected a link between his anti-immigrant nationalism and European nativist movements. Here\u2019s the key bit from Trump\u2019s interview with Michael Wollf in the Hollywood Reporter, published on 1 June: I ask if he sees himself as having similarities with leaders of the growing anti-immigrant (some would say outright racist) European nativist movements, like Marine Le Pen in France and Matteo Salvini in Italy, whom The Wall Street Journal reported Trump had met with and endorsed in Philadelphia. (\u201cMatteo, I wish you become the next Italian premier soon,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying.) In fact, he insists he didn\u2019t meet Salvini. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d And, in sum, he doesn\u2019t particularly see similarities \u2014 or at least isn\u2019t interested in them \u2014 between those movements and the anti-immigrant nationalism he is promoting in this country. \u201cAnd Brexit? Your position?\u201d I ask. \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cBrexit.\u201d \u201cHmm.\u201d \u201cThe Brits leaving the EU,\u201d I prompt, realizing that his lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all. \u201cOh yeah, I think they should leave.\u201d It is hard not to feel that Trump understands himself, and that we\u2019re all in on this kind of spectacular joke. His shamelessness is just so \u2026 shameless. On Wednesday, Trump told Fox News \u201cmy inclination would be to get out\u201d, but he attached a rather significant caveat: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should listen to me because I haven\u2019t really focused on it very much\u201d. Is Trump going to win now? That\u2019s the question on many lips. It may seem like a premature and rather panicky leap to infer from the result of the British referendum a completely overhauled reality in American politics. But the Dow is down 400 points right now, so clearly something has changed. Guardian columnist Richard Wolffe discerns in the Brexit vote a warning for Trump\u2019s opponents: But before Americans begin to chuckle at Boris Johnson and Britain\u2019s self-immolation, they should try to learn the lessons of what just happened in the old country. Otherwise they will be preparing for a Trump inaugural parade that rolls past a new Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in seven short months. First, the rise of charismatic, far-right leaders can only happen when the weak leaders of the center-right surrender to them. [...] The second lesson is about the siren call of nationalism. [...] The third lesson is a generational one. British voters under 34 were overwhelmingly supportive of staying inside the EU, but they were also the least likely to vote. [...] The fourth lesson is that voters don\u2019t seem to care about the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the anti-elite politicians. [...] The final lesson is that protest votes are not, in fact, a token gesture. They have a very real impact in the real world. James Hohman writes in the Washington Post that the Brexit result demonstrated \u201cstrong tides of anti-establishment anger, nationalism and populism\u201d sweeping the world. He observes several areas of overlap between the British political predicament and the American political crossroads: resentment of elites, xenophobia, isolationism, flawed polling, complacency. Others have pointed out that the Brexit vote demonstrated the power of hotbutton issues such as immigration and free trade to move voters. More than one commentator has pointed out that after Margaret Thatcher came to power, Ronald Reagan was elected. Trump himself has asserted that the Brexit vote is a bellwether \u2013 but he would say that. He speaks for an eager quadrant of the US political establishment, however, including erstwhile rival Ted Cruz, who, like Trump, has hailed the Brexit vote as a victory: \u201cThe United States can learn from the referendum and attend to the issues of security, immigration and economic autonomy that drove this historic vote,\u201d Cruz continued. Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith spoke with pollster Frank Luntz, who claimed to have seen the future: Frank Luntz, a leading political consultant and pollster, said: \u201cI have seen the future. If a wave of voter populism can sweep Britain out of Europe, it can sweep Donald Trump to the presidency in America. \u201cThe anger I heard in Britain is far wider and deeper in America. Just as leave exceeded every poll, so did Donald Trump in the primaries. And that may well continue into the fall.\u201d Not so fast... If Trump is to win, he will have to overcome his own dismal unpopularity, extremely substantial demographic challenges, equally substantial electoral map challenges, horrid poll numbers from pollsters with good track records in US presidential elections, a majority feeling of favorableness about the current president and optimism about the economy, and even, perhaps, certain strengths of his opponent. The evidence so far is that Trump has had significant difficulty expanding his appeal beyond the core of Republican voters who powered him through the primaries, despite for example Trump\u2019s direct appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters, who have responded with disdain. Benchmark Politics identifies multiple points on which the Brexit-Trump comparison breaks down. D), Trump, observes that the US presidential election is a contest between individuals and one of them is personally unpopular in a record-breaking way that would seem relatively unresponsive to voting in Britain: What\u2019s your take? Does the Brexit increase Trump\u2019s chances in November? President Barack Obama says the special relationship is enduring, and \u201cthe United Kingdom\u2019s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone\u201d. Here\u2019s the president\u2019s statement: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U.S. foreign, security, and economic policy. So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond. The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world. Hillary Clinton has released a statement on the Brexit, saying \u201cWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made.\u201d \u201cThis time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House,\u201d Clinton says. The statement calls for protection for working families from economic uncertainty and attests to \u201cAmerica\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain\u201d. Here it is in full: We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. We also have to make clear America\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests. It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Donald Trump has hailed Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, telling reporters in Scotland: \u201cThey took back control of their country.
