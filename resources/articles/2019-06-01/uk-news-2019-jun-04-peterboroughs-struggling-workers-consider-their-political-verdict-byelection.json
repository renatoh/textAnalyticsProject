At the 2014 Rochester byelection, Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet for tweeting a \u201ccondescending\u201d picture of a house flying multiple St George\u2019s cross flags with a white van parked in front. At the EU referendum, Boris Johnson made a play for white-van man by promising Brexit meant cheaper fuel. In Peterborough\u2019s parliamentary byelection on Thursday, this voting demographic will have another big say, but its members are not in an upbeat mood. Between 2009 and 2017, average wages in the Cambridgeshire city slid by 13% in real terms \u2013 a \u00a34,000 loss that few can afford. Their response on Thursday could take the form of an \u201cup yours\u201d to politics. \u201cI will not be voting,\u201d said Marc Cornell, 62, who delivers parcels 12 hours a day in his white Mercedes Sprinter for a courier company. \u201cIf we end up having another referendum I will never vote on anything again. I think it\u2019s pointless.\u201d Cornell earns the equivalent of the minimum wage but because he is among the estimated 1.1 million gig economy workers in the UK, he receives no sick pay, no pension and no paid leave. He has not taken a holiday in six years and has little more than the state pension to look forward to. \u201cIf there was something else out there I would be gone in a shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is not working for people like me. The government has allowed this and it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He complained of an absence of dignity in the gig economy. \u201cYou are just treated like a number,\u201d he said. He voted leave and normally votes Conservative, but has lost faith that Brexit is a good idea. Cornell and the rest of his family are fairly typical of workers in Peterborough these days: hard-working, low-paid and often in precarious employment. They rent their family home on an estate and rents have been rising. His wife, Susanne, works in a local care home and his son, Max, 23, has worked in Amazon\u2019s vast distribution warehouse, one of Peterborough\u2019s biggest employers. Covering 5 hectares (12 acres), it employs 1,000 people all year round and more than 1,000 more temporarily at peak periods. Max \u201chated every minute of it\u201d. Max voted remain and will vote Labour on Thursday, but he also feels uneasy about the future. \u201c[Amazon] was the only job I\u2019ve had where I didn\u2019t feel like a person, I felt like a sheep,\u201d he said. He described being accosted in the toilet by security guards after he made a couple of trips to check a football score on his phone. The trade union GMB mounted protests outside Amazon last November to coincide with the Black Friday peak period, with banners that read: \u201cWe are not robots.\u201d Amazon said it offered \u201cindustry-leading pay, comprehensive benefits and career growth opportunities, all while working in a safe, modern work environment\u201d. But Max Cornell doesn\u2019t see any future for himself in Peterborough, or even the UK. \u201cThe only jobs available for people my age are call centre, retail or warehouse,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way this country is going.\u201d He now works for Addison Lee, a minicab firm which also relies on gig economy drivers. The most visible change to working life in Peterborough has been net migration into the city from abroad, running at around 2,000 people a year for the last decade, bringing the non-British population to 16% by the end of 2017, compared with 10% across England. Shops named Bucharest Mini Market, the Baltic Store, the Mercearia Portuguesa and the Kabul Food Store line the Lincoln Road. The changes have upset some long-term residents. However, the quality of work and the large number of low-autonomy, low-paid jobs in the city is at least as much of a worry as the headline-grabbing issue of immigration. Alongside Amazon, Peterborough\u2019s biggest employers include Perkins, an engine manufacturer, owned by the US firm Caterpillar, which employs around 2,500 people, and BGL, which owns the Compare the Market insurance brand. The council has invested in improving Peterborough\u2019s attractive historic centre but its fabric quickly frays into betting shops, pawnbrokers and discount stores. Workers have below-average levels of vocational training and efforts are under way to try and reshape the economy. A new university is planned, while a closed M&amp;S in the city centre is being turned into 98 apartments, and car parks are being earmarked for new offices to lure tech companies wanting to connect with Google and Facebook, headquartered an hour away by train in King\u2019s Cross, London. \u201cWe need all of our residents, including those that have lived here for a long time, to benefit from the opportunities,\u201d said Tom Hennessy, the chief executive of Opportunity Peterborough, the city\u2019s economic development company. \u201cThere is a feeling that some have not and this in turn can lead to feelings of disconnect from the rest of society.\u201d Carl Mings, another courier, moved from a staff job at Parcel Force hoping the gig economy would offer a reward for hard work. Mings, who asked to use a pseudonym because he feared speaking out could cost him work, started earning more than \u00a32 a parcel but is now on 15% less. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you winning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no employment rights. The government needs to sort this out but they haven\u2019t sorted Brexit out. This charade has been going on for three years. They have wasted all that time.\u201d He is among those who watched closely as Theresa May made her maiden speech as prime minister in 2016, promising to rule on behalf of the \u201cjust managing\u201d. And then he watched as in 2018 she promised to crack down on bogus self-employment in the gig economy and boost workers\u2019 rights. But little had happened, he said. His pessimism was not shared by Sorin Ciobotaru, 36, a lorry driver from Romania, who has lived in Peterborough for three years with his partner, Mirela, 31, and their infant daughter. \u201cLife is what you make it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minimum wage is going up. If you want to work you can find a job. It\u2019s only hard if you don\u2019t want to work and drink beer every day. Everyone wants a better job, but you have to start from the bottom.\u201d Even so, Ciobotaru is considering moving back to Bucharest at some point, while Mings remains. Toiling in the gig economy has meant he has developed no new skills, and now he feels trapped. \u201cThe only opportunity is packing fruit in a box in a factory,\u201d said Mings. \u201cYou make as much as you can now, because tomorrow you know it is going to get bleaker. It shouldn\u2019t be like that. There\u2019s no hope. People don\u2019t feel they have a stake in society.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
