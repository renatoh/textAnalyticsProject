Themes of mortally wounded maleness and long-harboured grudges and dreams play out against a woodland backdrop in which one can almost hear the twang of duelling Appalachian banjos. Steven Mackintosh and Kathy Kiera Clarke offer solid dramatic support, while the repair shop becomes an emblem of both failed ambition and sturdy friendship. A convincing songbook lends credibility to the drama which modestly sidesteps cliche. Mark Kermode The Bucket List 2007, 12, Warner \u00a315.99 Or, more accurately, 'The 'Pass Me the Bucket' List'. Jack Nicholson (grinning) and Morgan Freeman (narrating) are the odd-couple curmudgeons; one rich, one poor; both terminal. Together, they cook up a list of things to do before striking the proverbial pot. Said list includes such vomit inducers as 'kissing the most beautiful girl in the world' and 'helping a complete stranger', alongside stuff involving skydiving, pyramids and mountaineering. Ugh! Like so many allegedly 'life-affirming' movies, this mawkish guff saps the audience's will to live, leaving one wondering how the director of Spinal Tap could stomach such sappy pap. Mark Kermode Picnic at Hanging Rock 1975, PG, Second Sight \u00a318.99 With a cast led by British actress Rachel Roberts, Peter Weir's haunting fable is set in the summer of 1900 when several pupils and a teacher from an exclusive girls' boarding school disappear during an outing to the eponymous beauty spot in Victoria. This eerie movie about the mystical encounter between European culture and the strange new Antipodean world was the first true masterpiece of the Australian cinema. Cinematographer Russell Boyd won a Bafta and became in demand the world over. The three-disc box set contains numerous extras including a lengthy 'making of' documentary. Its release is accompanied by Weir's first film, The Cars That Ate Paris (1974, 15, Second Sight, pounds 15.99), an accomplished, low-budget horror flick, set in the modern Outback where a seemingly ordinary township ensnares unwary visitors. In embryonic form, it contains the themes of his later pictures. Philip French"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
