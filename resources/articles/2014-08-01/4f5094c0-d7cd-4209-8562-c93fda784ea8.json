Although in his early days there were numerous comedies featuring established music hall stars, the anarchic, character-driven, \"tight little island\" films dubbed Ealing comedies really began in 1947 with Charles Crichton's Hue and Cry, after the patriotic second world war pictures that made the studio's reputation. The series, a reflection of the anxieties attending the 1940s age of austerity and the difficult birth of the welfare state, ended with a whimper when Alec Guinness played all the members of the same English family in Barnacle Bill, a long forgotten disaster that brought Ealing to a sad end in 1957. Not to be confused with the protean Guinness's dazzling 1949 Ealing debut in Kind Hearts and Coronets. In fact you could count the genuine classic Ealing comedies on six or seven fingers, four starring Guinness, and three of them in this box \u2013 Robert Hamer's Kind Hearts and Coronets, Charles Crichton's The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and Alexander Mackendrick's The Man in the White Suit (1951), all immaculately restored in Blu-ray that does justice to the crisp black-and-white images of the versatile cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, still alive at 102. All are subtly subversive in different ways, with Guinness in each case given a great supporting cast, as indeed he was in his even bleaker Ealing triumph, Mackendrick's The Ladykillers, the studio's last great comedy (1955), another \"state of the nation\" allegory. The three films transcend their times but are only fully appreciated in the context of the omplex social and political postwar years in which they were created. They are accompanied by interesting extras, the most notable figuring on the Kind Hearts disc. These include the alternative ending for the American version which (presumably either to satisfy the puritanical audience or to conform with the strict Hollywood Production Code) had to send Dennis Price to the gallows; a charming full-length commentary by Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian, director Terence Davies and Guinness's son Matthew; and an excellent revisionist essay on the film (originally broadcast on Radio 3) by the right-wing political commentator Simon Heffer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
