You will be so jittery with nerves that any hopeful plan for making a good impression is unlikely to come to much. So just focus on not showing yourself up. Contrary to expectations, the fight against a bad impression begins the very moment you leave your front door. This is because - and I think the cosmos is in general agreement with me here - if you enter into an altercation with a stranger en route to a new job (eg, a lumbering moron crushes your toe getting on the tube, then you inform said lumbering moron that he is, in fact, a lumbering moron), this stranger will almost certainly turn out to be your new boss. So try not to punch anyone before you arrive at work. Once inside the building: smile, be polite, and remember that now is not the time for wacky capers or winning japes. (Placing a bin on your desk with the word \"inbox \" scrawled across it in permanent marker will not be seen as an endearing little joke by your new employers. It will, however, ensure a prompt exit.) Try your best to fit in. You can't choose your colleagues, just as you can't choose your relatives - and in many ways the office is an amalgam of horribly dysfunctional families. There's your semi-conscious uncle slumped in the corner sipping whisky from a Coke can, disapproving comments about the length of your skirt, the interfering bossy-boots big sister keeping tabs on the length of your lunchbreak, and, of course, festering resentment over who mummy (ie, head office) really loves the most. Discovering your exact niche in this chaos will take time. More urgent, however, is the question of which family you plan to join. Most companies are home to at least two competing tribes, and no one likes a fence-sitter. This can all feel rather daunting at first - particularly because aligning yourself with the wrong players could be disastrous for your future career prospects. So stall as long as it takes to clock the winning team. In the meantime, spinelessly appearing to agree with everyone you meet without committing to anything concrete is the best strategy. It's called office politics for a reason, you know. At some point during your first day, it is likely you will be given a tour of your new surroundings and introduced to colleagues. Try to refrain from saying any of the following: \"My god, you look just like my last boss. Except rounder.\"... \"No, don't tell me your name - let me guess!\"... \"Hey, I've never worked with someone your age before! Can I have a Werthers Original?\" And if this is not just your first day, but also your first job, be warned: it is imperative you prevent your mother contacting your place of work. Whatever threats you make, she's going to be sorely tempted to ring your building to ask if you've made lots of friends and whether you finished all the jam sandwiches she packed you. This message will be relayed across the entire office by a loud-mouthed secretary. Don't take that risk. Tell her you never got the job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
