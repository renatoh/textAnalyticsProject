Enters room containing important men from FA and closes door behind him. 9am Alex Ferguson approaches closed door. 9.01am Ferguson tries handle. 9.02am Door does not open. 9.03am Ferguson tries handle. 9.04am Door does not open. 9.05am Ferguson tries handle, this time giving it a good old rattle. 9.06am Door remains firmly shut. 9.07am Ferguson deduces door has been locked, and concludes he is not allowed in. 9.08am - 9.13am A simmering. 9.14am Ferguson starts bellowing at closed door. \"It is my intention to play him at Tottenham! It is not ideal preparation but hopefully he has the temperament to handle it!! He will have a training session tomorrow because obviously he has not trained at all yesterday or today!!! That is the only concern!!!!\" 9.15am Met Office announces record high temperatures for December in Bolton as result of rays emitted by Ferguson's face. Door warps slightly but remains in frame. 10.25am Postman arrives. Proceeds to whistle jaunty melody. 10.26am - 10.40am Easy-on-the-ear blue-collar trills. 10.41am Postman slots postcard under door. \"Dear FA. Having lovely time on beach the other side of the world, probably. Wish you were here. Love S-G. PS: Don't ban Rio for Euro 2004, there's a governing body.\" 11.25am Door opens. Four FA goons hold Ferguson down while Eyal Berkovic is quickly ushered into room. Met Office announces record highs in Blackburn, Preston and Wigan. 11.26am Berkovic ordered to tell eventful tale of shopping trip with Ferdinand that fateful afternoon. 11.27am Having complied, Berkovic leaves. Goons release Ferguson. Door dissolves to cinder. Ferguson rushes in. 11.28am - 12.58pm Ferguson gives 90-minute statement, possibly involving firm beliefs and trenchant views. 2pm Mr Suit from Manchester United arrives and argues that Rio, a grown man, is prone to forgetting lots of things. Also that UK Sport is at fault for not leading Rio, a grown man, by the hand to the test, unzipping his trousers, stuffing his front tail into a bottle, turning on some running water, and repeatedly shouting \"tinkle time\". 2.20pm Decision will be made by tea-time, announces FA. 4.59pm Fiver washes down last forkful of supper with dregs from Purple Tin. Still no decision. Fiver has no choice but to leave story in mid-air without satisfactory conclusion. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY (SPONSORED BY LIVERPOOL FC) \"At the moment we know it is a difficult period. [But] we remain strong. We enjoy working together. There is strong team bonding and the players like the challenge. They can, on their day, beat any other team\" - Do you think Ged really believes this? You know, really believes it? * * * * * * * * * * * * A WANDERER WANDERS OFF Union Jack Hayward is a patriotic man. So patriotic, in fact, that he stashes his millions in an offshore bank account to avoid paying tax in the country he loves. But he's also capable of extreme generosity, having gifted his beloved Wolverhampton Wanderers millions of pounds over the past 13 years, and sending them on an amazing journey which started in the upper echelons of the First Division and sees them bound for the upper echelons of the First Division. But all good things must come to an end, and Union Jack today relinquished the reins of power at Molineux. \"I feel it is better for younger, fresher faces to take charge with hopefully younger and fresher ideas,\" he announced, not as you would hope hurriedly ushering Dave Jones and Paul Ince off the premises, but instead handing the club keys to his young son Rick, 51. \"We haven't found these wonderful, magical investors out there so it is absolutely terrific to be able to keep it in the family,\" added Jack the dad, who ousted chairman Jonathan Hayward in 1997 after a row over finances. \"My father has invested a fantastic amount of time, money and emotion over the years to get Wolves into the Premiership,\" began new owner Rick. \"After seeing his dream come true last May, he felt the best decision would be to step down.\" And Rick is a chip off the old block all right, with both a passion for the Wanderers and many, many business interests in the Bahamas. So there'll be money to spend in January, then? \"It is too soon for us to say exactly how much is going to be available,\" harrumphed Rick. \"We have always had my father's cheque-book but that has ended.\" Meanwhile Jack wandered off with the intention of going on a very long cruise. Let the good times roll! * * * * * * * * * * * * OFF ON YOUR HOLIDAYS? Bah! Not us. We'll be back next week with our annual Fiver Awards ceremony. Bah! No, hold on. Hurrah! * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea could blow \u00a360m on Sevilla's Jose Reyes, Charlton's Scott Parker, Barca's Carles Puyol, and David Trezeguet of Juventus. Hugo Viana could be rescued from St. James' Park by Sporting Lisbon. Spurs are in talks with Udinese about midfielder David Pizarro, with a \u00a33m move possible. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Thieves broke into administration offices at Stamford Bridge over the weekend and stole laptops, including one of Mr Abramovich's. Time to cancel the credit cards. Oldham have given Crystal Palace permission to talk to manager Iain Dowie about the vacancy at Selhurst Park, despite earlier flipping the Northern Irish FA the bird when they asked to do the same. And Rangers have asked to be part of a pilot scheme aimed at reintroducing alcohol to Scottish sports grounds, a move which is bound to set Glaswegian policemen sucking air through their teeth like plumbers assessing an unhealthy boiler. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Premier League Premier Review (6.30pm) No boozy or bawdy Xmas tales today, alas. But there's lots of interest in the Fiver's favourite 9% proof tipple, Purple Tin. Radio 5 Live: Sport on 5 (7pm) \"Pardon my ignorance but I've lived in the US a long time,\" says an all-too-honest Jerry Flavin, who then asks: \"What the hell is Purple Tin?\" Talksport: Football First, Second &amp; Third (7pm) Meanwhile Colin Jaffray says: \"Being an observant type (aren't all Fiver readers? Eh? Oh!) I have noticed that Purple Tin has replaced the recently retired 'do one' as the expression shoehorned at least twice into every edition.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off The Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Finally, Andy Roberts recommends everyone listen to the Alabama 3 debut CD Exile on Cold Harbour Lane, which contains the superb The Old Purple Tin (9% of pure heaven).\" A loud, belchy hic to that, Andy! * * * * * * * * * * * * SUBSCRIBE TO THE FIVER You can subscribe and unsubscribe at www.footballunlimited.co.uk/Fiver/Redirect * * * * * * * * * * * * CONTACT THE FIVER If you want to contact the Fiver, email the.boss@theguardian.com. * * * * * * * * * * * * WHY ARE WE ALWAYS GETTING ILL JUST BEFORE XMAS?
