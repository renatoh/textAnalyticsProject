The C&amp;G Trophy will be reinvented as a 50-over competition in two parallel conferences, as part of a major restructuring of one-day county cricket. The first-class forum, which accepted the recommendations of a working party, justifies the switch because county players will gain more exposure to 50-over cricket, to the benefit of the England side. Not that the England and Wales Cricket Board felt much need to justify anything yesterday, announcing major structural changes to the game two days before Christmas with its offices closed and its personnel absent. Knockout one-day cricket revitalised the game in the 1960s - Gillette eventually had to end their sponsorship because their name became more synonymous with cricket than with razor blades - but the competition has been downgraded in recent years. First came the former ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin's plan to expand the C&amp;G Trophy into cricket's FA Cup by introducing county Board XIs. Then the competition was shunted into early season, when the weather was poorer and so were the crowds. The death knell was the successful launch of the Twenty20 Cup, as the public showed an upsurge of enthusiasm for a shorter format of the game. In 2006 the C&amp;G will be played in the first half of the season, before England play the NatWest Triangular series. If Scotland and Ireland agree to join, each county will play nine matches. The Twenty20 competition will continue to be played in a 15-day window in midsummer. The success of Twenty20 has overshadowed the Totesport League which, in recognition of its fading appeal, will revert from 45 to 40 overs, will be trimmed to eight matches per county in two divisions of nine and will be played in the second half of the summer. That leaves the Frizzell County Championship, where the two-division format has survived. The three-up, three-down system, a sop to the weaker counties, has survived with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
