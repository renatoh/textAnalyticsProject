The decision, which Nokia told the Wall Street Journal was its own, not AT&amp;T's, means that the company is still no closer to breaking into the smartphone segment in one of the biggest markets for those devices. According to PocketNow, which seems to have the only details about the phone (Nokia's own site turns up a blank), the X7 would have had an 8MP camera and stereo speakers. And, presumably, the S^3 operating system. Nokia sources told the WSJ that they were concerned that AT&amp;T wouldn't give it sufficient marketing and subsidy support. That's quite likely, given that Nokia's latest range of smartphone don't seem to have figured highly in the reports for any of the bigger western markets. The release of the Nokia N8, the flagship smartphone, did... er.. OK, according to Patrick Standaert of Morgan Stanley, who in November suggested that a survey of 150 phone shops in Europe found an N8 sell-through of one N8 for every six iPhones sold. That would suggest 2.5m N8s for the just-ended quarter and 9m in 2011. Just as a reminder, Carphone Warehouse said late on Tuesday that smartphones made up 75% of its Christmas quarter sale, and that at some point in 2010 Android overtook every other operating platform\" for sales. Interesting that, because that implies pushing out Symbian, which Nokia uses, as well. Given that there are only really four mobile OSs in wide use in the UK - Android, Apple, RIM, Symbian - that suggests that Android got more than 25% (in the US, it was up to 40%), obviously pushing Apple down. And if you then allow that the Nokia numbers follow in line, then the N8 and related Nokia smartphones likely only had single-digit market shares. In that situation, AT&amp;T - seeing what was happening in Europe - might indeed have intimated to Nokia that it wasn't going to be putting a lot of money behind the X7. And Nokia might have decided that it was better to bide its time. Will MeeGo fill the gap? And if so, when? Nokia did provide an official comment to AllThingsD: \"We are working hard with our U.S. carrier partners to bring meaningful smartphone solutions to market that are compelling consumer experiences, have strong operator support and a thriving ecosystem. As in any business, plans can change and deliberate decisions must be made to enable clear focus on bringing the right products to market at the right time.\" \u2022 In other Nokia-related news, the company is being sued by Apple in London over claims that one of the Finnish company's patent claims, relating to scrolling on a touchscreen handset, is invalid. The lawsuit, filed yesterday in the High Court in London, challenges one of seven Nokia patents asserted against Apple in a September 2010 lawsuit in Dusseldorf. Nokia is suing Apple over a number of technologies in the iPhone which it says it has patented."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
