The Turkish international was due to play his first competitive game for almost four months in Villa's reserve team match against Blackburn, but it was postponed because of a frost-bound pitch. Alpay has shown a reluctance to appear for the reserves since being dropped from the first team after the game against Southampton on October 21 with Villa's manager Graham Taylor claiming he collected \"convenient\" injuries that prevented him from turning out. After the World Cup Alpay, who was named in the Fifa team of the tournament, made it clear that he wanted to leave Villa. But since then the club has had only a tentative inquiry from Blackburn. Now that Alpay will have to remain at Villa at least until the end of the season, Taylor is keen to resolve the issue. But a Villa spokesman said last night: \"There have been no discussions between the two parties, so nothing has been settled as yet.\" Leicester City have told Eric Hall he is not welcome at the Walkers Stadium because of the part he played in the events leading to the club going into adminstration. The agent was asked to leave the hospitality area before Monday's game against Portsmouth. Hall represents Dennis Wise, who launched a legal action against Leicester for \u00a32.3m after being sacked by them. The club was then forced to call in the administrators after Hall tried to obtain a winding-up order against them in respect of fees he was owed. \"He will not be forgiven for what he tried to do to this club,\" said Jon Holmes, acting chairman of New Fox plc, the club's new owners, and himself a football agent. Hall was at the game because he represents the Portsmouth midfielder Tim Sherwood and had acquired free tickets. \"Eric Hall came into the ground saying he was an employee of Portsmouth,\" Holmes said. \"I told him to go and that he was not welcome.\" Southampton's FA Cup quarter-final against Wolves at St Mary's will be played on Sunday March 9 (kick-off 4pm) and Arsenal's home tie with Chelsea at 5.15pm the previous day. Last night's rescheduled First Division game between Gillingham and Wimbledon was postponed, for a second time, due to a frozen pitch. Brentford's Second Division match against Colchester was goalless when called off for the same reason at half-time last night. Tonight's scheduled game between Bradford City and Crystal Palace has been called off because of a frozen pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
