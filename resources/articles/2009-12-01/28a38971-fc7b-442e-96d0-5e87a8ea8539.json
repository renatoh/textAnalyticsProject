Perhaps never in the history of rugby have two teams left the field hoping so much that the showers were in working order. An hour before kick-off the skies over Murrayfield were blue and the pitch encouragingly green. Midway through the first half, though, the sleet that was blowing across the pitch turned to a fully blown snowstorm. By the time Chris Paterson was lining up his second of three successful, and ultimately winning, penalties the full-back could hardly have seen the posts some 40 metres away while the Bath players lined up beneath them would have turned to snowmen had they waited a few more seconds. With the pitch turning into a skid-pad and players facing the risk of injury as well as frostbite, the referee Romain Poite announced that they would try to reach half-time and hope conditions improved. The Frenchman also hoped the organisers had a yellow or orange ball for the second half as the white ball, as well as Bath's white shirts, wasn't really helping the crowd and players make sense of it all. Heineken Cup rules stipulate that if a game lasts 60 minutes the result will stand, if less then it will be replayed. The conditions, if not the temperature, did improve after the break and the whole game survived unlike in Brussels where overnight temperatures of -12 degrees meant that the experiment of taking a Heineken Cup game to Belgium for the first time blew up in the organisers' faces. Stade and Ulster must find a new date, while Bath left the field here knowing they have no second chances after being overtaken at the bottom of the pool by the Scottish side, who deserved their victory for the enterprise they showed in the first and last quarters. Paterson and Bath's fly-half Nicky Little exchanged two penalties each in the first half but there was little hint of either side crossing the tryline. After what proved to be the winning kick, Bath then had two opportunities to take something from the match. But first, Little's replacement, Ryan Davis, was short with a penalty from around 45 metres. Then another replacement, Jack Cuthbert, tried one from a longer range. It had the distance but not the accuracy, but the truth is that this was a day when Jonny Wilkinson might have regretted his career choice. Paterson is a dead-eyed kicker, though, and no one knows this ground better. It was the full-back's 50th Heineken Cup game and after an unhappy time at Gloucester he is back in Scotland and looking as frisky as ever. Paterson was named man-of-the-match for his secure defensive kicking and counterattacks, giving Scotland's coach Andy Robinson a nudge as he mulls over his Six Nations options. Robinson, who coached both these sides, would have had mixed feelings about Bath, the club where he made his name as a player. Three victories have made this a miserable season for the English club. Steve Meehan had selected the South African Pieter Dixon, a try-scorer in last weekend's 16-9 win over Edinburgh, over the England hooker Lee Mears. The decision was not really vindicated with Dixon's throwing into the lineout contributing to Bath's first-half problems. One consolation was the performance of another South African, Luke Watson. The No8 is smaller but more dynamic than the Englishman Ben Skirving, who was expected to be first choice when he moved from Saracens last summer. But consolation prizes are not really what Bath's suffering supporters are looking for. A year ago the club's problems began in Scotland when their prop Matt Stevens failed a drugs test at a Heineken Cup game in Glasgow. Nothing much has gone right since, with three other players, including captain Michael Lipman, banned since then for refusing to take tests. Meehan faces a hard winter and more frosty responses from fans at the Rec."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
