Citizen\u2019s Advice said the companies that transmit electricity and gas around the UK, including National Grid, were reaping \u201ceye-watering\u201d average profit margins of 19% from their monopolies. That compares with the 4% margin that big six suppliers, such as British Gas, make selling power and gas to householders. The consumer group said Ofgem, which regulates the networks and sets limits on how much profit they can make, had allowed the firms to overinflate their projected costs of building pipes and wires. The energy regulator had also overestimated the business risks faced by the companies, and did not foresee an unprecedented period of low interest rates and bond returns, the charity said in a report published on Wednesday. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cEnergy network firms are enjoying a multibillion pound windfall at the expense of consumers. \u201cDecisions made by Ofgem have allowed gas and electricity network companies to make sky-high profits that we\u2019ve found are not justified by their performance.\u201d Ofgem rejected the claim it had failed consumers and said it had cut the costs of transmission, which account for nearly a quarter of the average household energy bill. Dermot Nolan, chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with its modelling and the figures it has produced, the Citizens Advice report raises some important issues about network regulation which will be addressed in the next control.\u201d The industry is halfway through an eight-year period of price controls that started in 2013 for gas distributors, electricity and gas transmission firms, and 2015 for electricity distributors. Citizen\u2019s Advice calculated that over the eight years, the energy networks would return more \u00a325bn to their investors and creditors, and \u00a37.5bn of that would be excessive profits. That central estimate compared to a low one of \u00a33.5bn and a high estimate of up to \u00a311.1bn. While disputing the thrust of the report, Ofgem said that when setting the controls it had expected energy networks\u2019 profit margins to range from around 7% to double digits. In the event, it admitted that many had recorded returns at or around double digits. \u201cWhen we look at this next time we need to learn the lessons of why that is the case,\u201d said Jonathan Brearley, partner for networks at Ofgem. \u201cWe fixed a set of assumptions. It turned out this time it has turned out to the benefit of companies. However it could have gone the other way to the benefit of consumers,\u201d he added. Citizen\u2019s Advice called for the excess profits to be returned to consumers in the form of a one-off rebate, which it calculated would be worth \u00a3285 a household \u2013 about a quarter of the average annual dual-fuel bill. Failure to do so would risk incurring the wrath of billpayers and politicians, it warned. \u201cAs their colleagues in the supply business know, it does not take much for public opinion to curdle against an industry,\u201d the report said, in reference to calls earlier this year for a cap on the prices charged by energy suppliers. If suppliers do not return the money to consumers, the government should step in, the group said. On Wednesday, Ofgem will announce plans for the next set of price controls on energy networks, which will start in the 2020s. The regulator said one question would be whether eight-year periods were a sensible length for the controls, with Citizen\u2019s Advice saying that forecasting interest rates and other variables over such a long time was \u201can impossible task\u201d. Nolan said the next regime would be \u201ctougher\u201d for the energy networks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
