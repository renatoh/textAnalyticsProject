With 10 days for the trip, and possibly hiring a car, using different airports, we would like your advice on the best way to tackle this challenge. We were thinking of next spring or early summer to enjoy the warmer, more reliable climate, and reduce costs where possible. What accommodation would you suggest, and would we be able to book (flexibly) in advance? Vivien Evans, Nottingham What a fantastic trip down memory lane for your father. April to June is the best time to visit, as costs are lower than in high summer. Consider Ryanair (0870 156 9569), which flies to Venice Treviso and Trieste airports if you want to have an open-jaw trip. In Venice, the hotels away from San Marco are better value - try Hotel Silva &amp; Ariel (00 39 041 71 47 43; fax 00 39 041 72 03 26) for doubles sold as singles from about \u00a340-50. You should book in advance year-round. If you'd like to stay somewhere slightly less frenetic, Padua is only 30 minutes away from Venice by train and is a lovely destination in its own right. Away from Venice, you should have fewer problems - asking at the APT (Tourist Office) when in town should yield an acceptable room. All the major car rental companies will be represented in Venice, but you may want to consider hiring a vehicle later as one is pretty unnecessary in the city. Try Holiday Autos - but be aware it will cost more if you decide to do a one-way rental. You may wish to do some driving to explore the road your father helped rebuild, then return to Venice. A good map of the region will help - try the Touring Club Italiano's 1:200,000 series. Safety in Israel There has been a lot written about visiting Muslim countries since 11 September; however, I have seen nothing about Israel. My husband and I have a holiday booked in Eilat in January and I have not been able to find out anything regarding the situation there other than from our specialist tour operator who has told us that all is OK. Where can I look for up-to-date information? Nicola Francis, via email Tension in Israel has greatly increased due to recent bombings. Although these attacks are not aimed specifically at British nationals, they usually take place in areas where tourists congregate (mainly Jerusalem and Tel Aviv). Any advice from the Israeli authorities should be strictly followed and it is important that you monitor regional developments in case the situation worsens. Try BBC online and CNN Europe for breaking stories. You can find out the latest travel advice by visiting the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office's website The FCO is advising against travel to the West Bank and Gaza. Risk of terrorist activity in Eilat is minimal but British nationals are advised to register at the British Embassy or Consulate General upon arrival. The Israel Government Tourist Office (020 7299 1111) states that tourists travelling to Eilat are under no threat but that they should be aware of the national situation. Make sure you have adequate insurance. Bangkok's secrets I am travelling to Thailand and have two free days in Bangkok. It's a city I love, but have already visited most of the main tourist spots. Is there anything that you recommend I do that would be a little bit different? Sue Webster, via email Despite its rapid urbanisation, Bangkok has managed to retain a certain 'Thainess'. Take some time to explore Chinatown. The narrow alleys are packed with stalls selling fresh produce, antiques and silks. You'll also find lots of restaurants. Take some time out for a Thai massage. One of the best places is the Wat Pho Temple but the more commercial outlets on Th Surawong (near Patpong) are also good. The Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (Th Phra Ram IV) is also worth a visit. Run by the Thai Red Cross, this is a research facility where venomous snakes are milked daily to make snake-bite antidotes. You can watch them being fed and milked. Visit the National Theatre on Th Chao Fa near Phra Pinklao Bridge. A kohn performance (a masked dance-drama) is a fascinating spectacle but there are only six or seven performances a month. For further information on any of these events contact the Tourism Authority of Thailand (020 7499 7679) Zimbabwe or bust I am trying to buy a plane ticket from Zimbabwe to the UK for early/mid April 2002 and returning mid/late September 2002. Any thoughts on the best way to arrange a cheap flight from this end? Price quoted at Zimbabwe end was about \u00a31,400. Steve Boyde, Barrow-in-Furness Any ticket, almost without exception, that you buy for travel originating outside the UK is going to be more expensive. This is especially so in countries that are short of foreign exchange and undergoing economic crises. This is why a Zimbabwe-UK-Zimbabwe ticket costs more than twice the rate for a ticket that starts in the UK. You'll probably get the best price by trying travel agents in Johannesburg, South Africa. You can pick up a return ticket from Johannesburg to Manchester for around \u00a3600. To reach Zimbabwe from Johannesburg travel overland or buy a return flight to Harare or Victoria Falls for \u00a3300. Over to you... readers' feedback In response to last week's inquiry from Morgan Dye about budget travel in Japan: I would highly recommend the overnight bus services offered by Japan Rail. They go between most cities, are significantly cheaper than the train and save on accommodation costs. They have reclining seats and a blanket, eye mask and slippers are provided so that you can get some sleep. Try the Japanese tourist information website. You also didn't mention youth hostels in your reply. They are a wonderful way to see Japan and some of the mountain hostels are spectacular. They are by far the cheapest place to sleep. Most have at least one English speaker, so booking in advance isn't too much of a problem. On that note - a tip when looking for English speakers is to ask teenagers rather than older people, who are often reluctant to put their language skills to the test. Melanie Simms by email Mrs Sunderland who wanted directions to Nowhere, Arizona, may be interested in the following suggestions: If she's visiting Arizona she could drive into New Mexico where she'll find the Middle of Nowhere Caf\u00e9 and Bar in Nutt. It's exactly that. We had been told by a grizzled old traveller called Bob Sundown that we would get a meal there at any time of day or night. He had a homemade caravan drawn by a donkey, with his menagerie of chickens, dogs and kittens on board. When we reached the Middle of Nowhere it was closed, so we drove on to Truth or Consequences. There's also the Apache Kid Cemetery, the Very Large Array Telescope site and numerous ghost towns in this area. Amanda Schiff, by email \u00b7 We welcome letters.
