For three days at the Oval Warren Hegg's side, the only other team to win both opening fixtures, gave as good as they got, often more. The most dynamic batting of the contest had come from Andy Flintoff, the least distinguished on the first evening while Surrey were subsiding to 92 for seven. On Saturday morning the match appeared delicately poised: the hosts, 200 for four, needed a further 105 to complete their highest fourth-innings chase against these opponents. Mark Ramprakash ensured not a bead of sweat crossed their brow. On the day he was dropped from the Test squad for the 10th time, Ramprakash guided Surrey to a three-wicket win with an impeccable 119 not out, the 56th first-class hundred of his career. Alec Stewart (46) did his not inconsiderable bit, sharing the game's only century stand, the chase completed well before lunch with Ramprakash concluding proceedings in the grand manner, lofting Gary Keedy over long-off for an immense six. Not since 1958 have Surrey begun a championship campaign with three wins. Azhar Mahmood (15) hit briskly before bidding what may prove to be au revoir. Although he will now trade places with Saqlain Mushtaq, his Pakistan Test colleague, if the counties stick by their decision to allow two imports he may be back next spring. Despite a dogged 130 from Warwickshire's Nick Knight, Leicestershire completed their expected victory at Grace Road. Darren Maddy, primarily a batsman, enhanced his burgeoning reputation with the ball, taking three wickets for 59 as the visitors eventually folded for 439. Michael Bevan led the way with 38 not out for the hosts, who reached 94 for three in less than 15 overs to win by seven wickets. Mike Kasprowicz may have taken 64 overs to capture his first wicket for Glamorgan but the Australian made amends aplenty against Worcestershire, sealing an impressive win with five for 77 as the hosts, set 337 to win, fell 111 short. Darren Thomas bowled Graeme Hick - who has reached double figures just once in five Second Division innings - and wound up with eight wickets in the match. Only Stephen Peters and Ben Smith mounted any prolonged resistance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
