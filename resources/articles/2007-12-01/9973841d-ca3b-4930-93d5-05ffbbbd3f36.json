In 1975, having played with various Merseyside groups, he joined Broad Street Rumour in Reading, before co-founding the new wave El Seven. Their 1980 single, Radio Tokyo, coupled with Jones's Turn Out the Light, topped the Melody Maker independents' chart. Later came Magnifico, an EP. The track Under Control - augmented by Lol Coxhill and Mike Cooper - appeared on a 1982 compilation album of Reading groups, Beyond the River. Later Garry bought a double bass and joined forces with acoustic guitarist Steve Rolfe as The Lost Weekend. His salary from his computer job buoyed later ventures, and he spent vast amounts of time in the studio, working on new material. His last public appearance was with my band, Clayson and the Argonauts, in spring 2006. He is survived by his wife Katy and daughter Louise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
