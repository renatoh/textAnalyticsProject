It turned out to be the best match of this year\u2019s competition, heck, probably the best two-legged tie we have seen for years in the Champions League. It was breathless from start to finish, but what a difference between the beginning and end of this game. Juventus were flawless for the first hour: they ran themselves into the ground, they forced mistakes from Bayern and for all Bayern\u2019s possession, Juve made the far better chances. The thing is, with the score at 2-0, they didn\u2019t finish Bayern off. Morata (x2) and Cuadrado both missed gilt-edged chances. Juve\u2019s wrongly had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside. They would pay for those mistakes. Guardiola were tactically out-thought by Allegri, but it was his changes that made the difference in getting Bayern back into this match. Two of his subs: Thiago and Coman scored in extra time to seal this win, and Coman, on loan from Juventus, also provided the cross for M\u00fcller\u2019s 91st-minute equaliser. What a player the Frenchman will be, what a player he is already. Juventus\u2019 changes, taking off Morata and Cuadrado, also meant that Juventus were increasingly on the back foot. In the end, the pressure proved too great. Would Juventus have survived if they had had the presence of Chiellini, the legs of Marchisio, the clinical Dybala? We\u2019ll never know. Thanks for joining me, tonight was a joy. Ta for the emails and tweets, see you next time. Bye! Bayern Munich are into the quarter-finals! ET 30 min: One minute added on here. Benatia, sitting on the sidelines in a big puffer jacket, is laughing. He must be relieved. ET 29 min: Bonucci has one final chance for Juventus, but again Neuer is there, standing tall, to collect his effort. He knows he should have done better. Juve know, after the position that they put themselves in, that they should have done better. ET 28 min: \u201cThis is brill,\u201d emails Christopher Lee. \u201cCan we keep Juve for the next round too. Can we? CAN WE?\u201d No. ET 26 min: Two golden chances for Juventus! Oh, they could so easily have got themselves back into this game. But a fantastic Neuer save from a Mandzukic volley (that he should have buried) and the subsequent rebound, scuffed over the bar from Sturaro (all of four yards out) means Bayern keep their two-goal advantage. ET 24 min: Sturaro and Bernat each given a yellow card. I\u2019m not going to lie, I missed what that was for. ET 22 min: Coman is on loan from Juventus, but it is a long-term one, two years I think, and Bayern have the right to buy him at the end of that loan. They surely will, hes got the second most assists in the Champions League this season. And he\u2019s only 19. Regarding the loan clause that I mentioned earlier, I am mistaken: \u201cRemember the Chelsea Atletico Champions League Semi Final saga a few years ago while Courtois was on loan there?\u201d remembers Cian Mulligan. \u201cThey don\u2019t hold up in Europe.\u201d Game over. And it\u2019s Coman, on loan from Juventus, who has delivered the telling blow. But what a goal. Vidal, just as he did for Bayern\u2019s equaliser, nips in to win the ball in midfield and he feeds Coman. The Frenchman is well inside his own half, but with Juventus committed forwards, he breaks into space and isn\u2019t challenged until he\u2019s travelled a full 60 yards. Bonucci eventually gets to him, but he is only a bystander as Coman cuts in on his weaker left, and curls a beautiful shot into the top left-hand corner. Is that the winner? Thiago plays a delightful one-two with M\u00fcller on the edge of Juve\u2019s area and his first-time finish catches Buffon off guard, the ball rolling into the corner. I\u2019m not sure he would have got there anyway. The Allianz Arena erupts. Thiago rips off his shirt in delight, yellow card. But he doesn\u2019t care. Juventus look broken. ET 16 min: Coman, on loan from Juventus remember, is looking the most dangerous player for Bayern at the moment. It seems baffling that Juventus didn\u2019t insert a clause in Coman\u2019s contract when they let him go. Somebody in the admin office is getting a clip round the ear. Juventus would 1,000,000% take penalties right now. Who would you fancy to prevail? And who would be your five takers for either Bayern or Juventus? Answers on a postcard to michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18 ET 15 min: In case you\u2019re not aware, Arsenal didn\u2019t make it through to the last eight in Barcelona. And the world continues to turn. The sixth successive season that Arsenal have gone out in the last 16 of this competition. ET 13 min: Yellow card for Pereyra. Surely we can\u2019t be far from a red card now, I make it seven people on a booking tonight. ET 11 min: Juventus win a free-kick in Bayern\u2019s half. Here come the cavalry: Barzagli, Bonucci, Pogba. But it\u2019s an awful delivery, and doesn\u2019t beat the first man. ET 9 min: Coman has been a breath of fresh air on that right hand side. He is so strong and brushes past Evra to the byline, but his cross is well intercepted at the near post by the everpresent Bonucci. ET 7 min: It\u2019s heartening to see Juventus adopting the same approach with which they had such success in the first half. They are pressing the ball high up the pitch. But have they still got the legs? Hmmmm. ET 5 min: Ribery gets to the byline on the left, twists and turns to make half a yard, and crashes a cross/shot towards goal. Buffon decides not to catch it, and punches it back out into the danger zone but Lichtsteiner is there to boot it away. ET 3 min: Fantastic chance for Lichtsteiner! Sturaro does well down the right, gets a low cross to the near post where Mandzukic is waiting. With his back to goal, he has the strength to hold off Alaba, and lays the ball back to Lichtsteiner \u2026 good save from Neuer. The Swiss full-back should probably have done better but the ball fell on his weaker left foot and Neuer got down well to his right. ET 1 min: Lewandowski wins an early corner. Here comes another cross for Juventus \u2026 safely away. Interesting to see that in the small break before we kick off again, whilst Guardiola is giving his Pep talk to Bayern\u2019s players, it is Buffon, not manager Massimiliano Allegri that is giving Juventus\u2019 players their instructions. So close for Juventus. But one would think they\u2019ve got a tough half-hour ahead of them. 90+2 min: Buffon rallies the troops, encouraging his team-mates on. This tie is certainly still in the balance. Bayern have done it! And yep, it came from a cross! Vidal robs the ball in midfield, feeds Coman on the right and he whips a inch-perfect cross to the back post, where M\u00fcller makes no mistake, nodding past Buffon! 90 min: Only a few minutes left for Juventus to secure the most famous of results. \u201cThis is the best two-leg match I can remember,\u201d says Andy Gordon. 89 min: Douglas Costa is the only Bayern player that seems interested in forcing extra time. 88 min: Bayern hit the bar! But Lewandowski is ruled offside, after he again latched onto a Douglas Costa cross. Juventus hanging on. 86 min: Bayern keeping the ball nicely, passing the ball back to Neuer. Just what are they doing? There\u2019s four minutes left! \u201cI agree with you (70 min) and the manner in which Bayern have managed to scrape their goal (72 min) that Guardiola needs to channel his inner Sam Allardyce for the rest of this match,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cRoute One balls to Lewandowski and M\u00fcller. Repeat! Ab sofort and ad nauseam!\u201d 84 min: He may not have had the most glamorous of games, save for his flick-dragback earlier, but Alex Sandro has been a monster tonight. Playing left-wing, he\u2019s helped out Evra all night, and is at it again to cover and cut in front of Coman, who fouls the Brazilian. 81 min: Pep is bouncing round his technical area like Greg Rutherford on speed. He can\u2019t stand still, and is shouting lots of things in German, none of which I understand. I think he\u2019s saying: \u201cattack.\u201d 79 min: Buffon again relieves the pressure for Juventus, coming to claim a cross. At least Bayern have finally found a route to goal: get the ball wide and into the box! 77 min: Vidal tries his luck from range, but he\u2019s way off target. That is poor decision making from the Chilean. You\u2019re not beating Buffon from there anyway. 74 min: For the first time in this match, Juventus are looking nervy, simply hacking the ball clear whenever they get it. A relentless stream of Bayern attacks await. The home crowd have found their voice, too. One more Bayern goal, and we\u2019ll have extra time! Bayern score \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 from a cross. Coman does exceptionally well to chase down a ball he had no right to get from the byline, cuts the ball back to Douglas Costa, and the Brazilian delivers a wicked dipping cross to the back post, which Lewandowski nods home. Game on! 70 min: Yellow card for Cuadrado, after colliding with Alaba. Bayern meanwhile, continue to have plenty of possession and little end product. With Juve camped on the edge of their box, they need to cross the ball! Stop passing it sideways! 68 min: Penalty shout for Bayern! Lewandowski gets to the byline and cuts the ball back. Bonucci is there yet again to block, but was that with his arm? Lewandowski and M\u00fcller certainly think so, but the referee gives a corner, which is terribly taken by Douglas Costa. 67 min: And here comes Juve\u2019s first change: Sturaro, who scored in the first leg, comes on for Khedira. In the library that is the Allianz Arena, you can hear Juve\u2019s fans loud and clear, singing Khedira\u2019s name. 66 min: David Brennan has weighed in on Pep: \u201cGlad to see him gone. Too OCD and not suited to German football plus he destroyed the German heart of the Bayern team. He took over a Champions League winning team and failed three years in a row (all in home legs).\u201d 64 min: I\u2019m surprised to see this but Juventus are still running as hard as they did in the first half. They surely must run out of steam soon. Perhaps Massimiliano Allegri will make a change soon. 62 min: Juventus are sitting increasingly deeper. Bernat has a snapshot inside the Juve box but there are just too many bodies, and Hernanes hacks the ball clear. 60 min: Bayern make their second change: Coman coming on for Xabi Alonso. The former Juventus youngster set up three of Bayern\u2019s five goals at the weekend against Werder Bremen. 59 min: If Juventus don\u2019t progress here, they will be kicking themselves. As well as Morata has played, he has also missed three gilt-edged chances, whilst Cuadrado also should have buried his chance at the end of the first half. What\u2019s more, replays from another angle show that Morata\u2019s disallowed goal earlier was actually onside! 57 min: Two golden chances for Morata! Both are all his own work: first he outpaces and strong-arms Alaba (just what is going on with the Austrian tonight?!) cuts past Kimmich but his left-footed shot is straight at Neuer. Not a minute later, Morata is at it again, this time cutting on his right foot, ghosting past Lahm and shooting on goal from eight yards out. It is deflected over, owing to a last-ditch slide tackle from Alaba. It was a certain goal if the Bayern defender didn\u2019t get anything on it. 55 min: Meanwhile, in Barcelona, the comeback is on! Sort of. Arsenal\u2019s Mohamed Elneny has scored an absolute peach of a goal to make it 1-1 on the night, and 3-1 on aggregate. Follow the action with Scott Murray, if you are foolish enough to turn away from this game: 53 min: Yet another yellow card! Bonucci this time after he took matters into his own hands to stop a dangerous Bayern counter-attack. \u201cWhilst he might now be past his very best, surely only the hardest of hearts would deny Gigi Buffon a UCL winners medal before he retires- aside from anything else, have you ever noticed just how happy he looks when he\u2019s doing the pre-match pleasantries?! What a guy! Hardened regards (in keeping with the Morrissey references) James A. Crane\u201d 51 min: Lewandowski, who was winded moments earlier after a collision with Alex Sandro, catches Evra from behind. He\u2019s the latest to go into the book, despite the protests from the Pole. 49 min: Just as in the first half, Juventus are the far better team in these opening moment of the second half. First to everything and Alex Sandro is giving Lahm something to think about on the left with some of that Brazilian flair. Dragback + flick = woof. 47 min: The latin blood is up! Vidal and Cuadrado go for a 50/50 ball, both go studs up and although there is little to no contact, Vidal stands over Cuadrado wagging his finger angrily and telling the Colombian exactly what he thinks. Yellow card. Handbags ensue, and in the aftermath, Lichtsteiner is also shown a yellow card. Peeeeeep! We\u2019re off again. Bayern have made one change: Bernat coming on for Benatia, who had a torrid time against Pogba and Morata in that first half. Fact attack: tonight\u2019s referee, Jonas Eriksson, is one of the richest people on the pitch: he\u2019s worth about \u00a36m, after selling his stake in a sports media rights business in 2011. Makes you wonder what Bayern will do once they get a decent manager in \u2026 \u201cJupp Heynckes &gt;&gt; Pep Guardiola.... it\u2019s time to discuss.\u201d emails D.Hindle. Half-time reading: Cuadrado has been just one of the star performers in this first half. Something from the archives: here\u2019s how he made his way to Italy (before signing for Chelsea last year) If Juventus score one more goal in the second half, Bayern will have to score FOUR to make it through to the last eight. 45 min: One minute added on here. I don\u2019t want this to end. 43 min: Juventus should be 3-0 up! It\u2019s so easy for Juventus going forward, a simple ball up the line to Pogba, and the Frenchman is able to cut inside in the Bayern box and roll the ball across Neuer\u2019s six-yard box. It misses everyone but Cuardrado, who comes steaming in at the back post and smashes a shot goalwards from three yards out. It somehow stays out, a combination of Neuer and the post saving Bayern. Wow. 41 min: Great save by Buffon! Bayern\u2019s first real chance, and it fell to Lewandowski, who has been deathly quiet these 41 minutes. But the ball breaks to the Pole in the box, and he shoots hard and low from around the penalty spot. Buffon is equal to it, the ball rebounding back out. Barzagli slides to hook the ball clear, inadvertently hoofs it against the midriff of Lewandowski and the ball bounces a yard wide. Close! 39 min: Douglas Costa shoots on goal, and this time it\u2019s on target, so Bonucci put his face in the way. What a spartan. 37 min: Morata is booked for a high foot on Kimmich. Replays show the youngster took a hefty boot to the face. Ouch. I said pre-match that Kimmich was susceptible to a bit of rough, and that\u2019s exactly what Juventus are giving him. 35 min: Douglas Costa is doing his best Arjen Robben impression, cutting in off the right flank and firing a powerful left-foot shot at goal. He\u2019s missed the target on three occasions now. 33 min: \u201cNot a chance is Neuer the best \u2018keeper in the world at the moment,\u201d replies Philip Wainwright. \u201cI\u2019d have Keylor Navas, De Gea and maybe even Lloris in ahead.\u201d \u201cI think De Gea is very under-appreciated for his ball distribution, and he\u2019s an excellent source for starting a rare United attack,\u201d notes Stanley Wu. \u201cNot as fancy as Neuer\u2019s gung-ho dribbles, but very effective nonetheless.\u201d 31 min: This is perhaps the most complete performance I have seen all season. Bayern look lost. Everybody in a black and white shirt is running their socks off, everyone seems 100% sure of their job tactically, and when the chances have presented themselves, Juventus have been clinical. It\u2019s been a joy to watch so far. Khedira, it transpires, was given a yellow card for doing his laces up inside the centre-circle when Bayern were re-stating play. Very harsh, that. \u201cBet Chelsea are glad they go rid of Cuadrado,\u201d emails Ruth Purdue. \u201cWhat composure he had. But is is all about Morata, that goal.\u201d WHAT. A. GOAL. Counter-attacking football at it\u2019s best, as Khedira robs Lewandowski on his own 18-yard-line, gives the ball to Morata and the Spaniard just starts to run. And run and run and run and run. The Spaniard dribbles in a straight line through the spine of Bayern, shrugging off Alaba, cutting past Benatia and at the perfect moment as Kimmich comes across, he releases Cuadrado with a clever reverse ball. The Colombian has all the time in the world to shoot past Neuer, but instead cuts back inside the retreating Lahm, and cooly sidefoots inside the near post just when you thought he had left it too late. Juventus are 2-0 up and they deserve it. Pep\u2019s face is a picture. He looks genuinely dumbfounded. \u201cWhat if Meesi had scored that?\u201d asks Millesh Mohankumar. \u201cThe world would\u2019ve gone bonkers! That really was a cool headed amazing finish. 25 min: Juventus defending deep in front of the own penalty box, no space for M\u00fcller, Costa or Lewandowski to operate. Juventus happy to attack on the counter attack. 22 min: Morata has the ball in Bayern\u2019s net \u2026 but he is judged to be offside! Bayern are far too casual pinging the ball around at the back and another nervy Neuer clearance rebounds off Khedira into Morata\u2019s path. The striker cooly lifts the ball over Neuer into the net, replays show he was only a yard offside from that rebound. Lucky Bayern! 20 min: Costa catches Evra with a flailing arm under a high ball. Free-kick. Juventus have been perfect this first 20 years. Bayern are seriously rattled. 18 min: Alaba, as is his wont, is playing very high. He\u2019s playing at left-back tonight remember, not centre-back, and there is plenty of space for Cuadrado to exploit on the counter-attack should he get the chance. 16 min: \u201cThere\u2019s the classic once every other month inexplicable error from Neuer,\u201d emails Bryan Tisinger. \u201cI don\u2019t watch too much of Bayern or Germany, but I always see Neuer make a few crazy errors every year that are easily preventable. Most of them occur because he refuses to use his hands sometimes. As a Liverpool supporter, I thought for a second I was watching Simon Mignolet in goal, especially with Bayern in all red.\u201d Is he still the best goalkeeper in the world? This might be a UK-centric view, but surely David de Gea is giving the big German a run for his money? Send any thoughts to michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18. 14 min: Chance for Morata! Alex Sandro gets free on the left touchline, dinks a bouncing ball through to Morata, who is playing on the shoulder of Bayern\u2019s defence. It\u2019s a difficult ball to control and the angle in tight, and Juve\u2019s striker can only volley the ball over Neuer\u2019s bar. 12 min: Pogba catches Kimmich with a high elbow, but it\u2019s not malicious and the referee just blows for a foul. 10 min: Ribery gets some room at the back post but he can only turn his effort well over the bar. Bayern are finally beginning to assert themselves, enjoying possession inside Juventus\u2019 half \u2013 Juventus\u2019 pressing in the opening 10 minutes was relentless. They surely can\u2019t keep this up. 8 min: What a start! The replays show that Neuer was far too zealous in coming off his line and should have stayed put. That said, it was a cool finish from Pogba. Buffon, for the record, went absolutely postal celebrating in front of the Juventus fans up the other end of the field. Juventus take the lead on the night, and in the tie! I said Pogba was playing further forward than he normally does and it pays off: after Morata capitalised on a miscue from Alaba, the Spaniard\u2019s shot ricochets off Neuer, and Pogba is there to collect the rebound, sidefooting the ball into an empty net through a crowd of scrambling Bayern defenders. 5 min: Juventus have lined up in a 4-5-1 formation, with Alex Sandro and Cuadrado playing on either flank. Pogba has started the game more as a No10, tucked in behind Morata. 3 min: Brilliant, brilliant ball from Costa, as he thread the eye of the needle and dissects the Juventus defence with a fizzing pass, but Vidal, all alone and through on goal, can\u2019t control the ball and Buffon gratefully pounces on the ball. That was Joel Campbell-esque from Costa. 1 min: Morata is full of beans and he closes down Neuer, who uncharacteristically boots the ball out of play for a throw in. #flustered Peeeeep peeeeep! And we\u2019re off! The teams are out! It\u2019s that time! Bayern in all red, Juventus in their famous black and white. Bayern\u2019s home form in Europe isn\u2019t too shabby. Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last nine Champions League games, although he has never scored against Buffon. One last plug for this excellent feature on Bonucci by Blair Newman. Features the story of Bonucci punching an armed robber inside a Ferrari (what else?) car dealership and the time that he spent hours eating garlic sweets just so that he would have bad breath to put off Totti and Gervinho during Juventus v Roma. If that isn\u2019t commitment to the cause, I don\u2019t know what it. The 28-year-old, in the absence of Chiellini tonight, will have to keep out of his skin to keep M\u00fcller and co at bay. It was Paul Pogba\u2019s birthday yesterday \u2013 he is now 23 years old, gulp \u2013 and Bayern Munich sent their regards. With Dybala missing through injury, Pogba is arguably Juventus\u2019 most pivotal player tonight, and his battle with former Juve hero Vidal in the middle of that midfield will be crucial if the Italian team are to get anything from the game. If you haven\u2019t read Raphael Honigstein\u2019s interview with David Alaba, then do. If nothing else, you will find out that David\u2019s DJ\u2019ing father, George Alaba, released this hit in 1997. What an absolute banger. As discussed, both teams are hit by injuries. Robben is OUT! He\u2019s got a cold. Pep has recalled Medhi Benatia in central defencea longside Kimmich, which means that David Alaba is punted out to the left. Despite scoring two of Bayern\u2019s five goals against Werder Bremen at the weekend, Thiago is left on the bench. Mandzukic is not quite fit enough to start against his former club \u2013 he limped off in the 1-0 win over Sassuolo on Friday night \u2013 and so Morata starts up top for the Bianconeri. Shame that, as I think Mandzukic\u2019s physicality and work rate could definitely have got to Kimmich, who stands just 5ft7in. Bayern Munich: Neuer, Lahm, Kimmich, Benatia, Alaba, Alonso, Douglas Costa, Muller, Vidal, Ribery, Lewandowski. Subs: Ulreich, Thiago, Rafinha, Bernat, Gotze, Rode, Coman. Juventus: Buffon, Lichtsteiner, Barzagli, Bonucci, Evra, Khedira, Pogba, Cuadrado, Hernanes, Alex Sandro, Morata. Subs: Neto, Zaza, Mandzukic, Asamoah, Rugani, Sturaro, Pereyra. Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) Welcome to the best football match of the night. That\u2019s right folks, forget Barcelona v Arsenal: there\u2019s no point, it\u2019s already finished, est\u00e1 terminado. You can watch the Messi highlights reel later. You\u2019ll have to get your St Johnstone v Ross County updates somewhere else. Welcome to snowy Bavaria where we\u2019ve got two juggernauts, both top of their league, both in the form of their lives: Bayern Munich and Juventus. Oh yes, make no mistake, this Champions League last-16 second leg is \u2013 like a light that Morrissey kept banging on about \u2013 ON. That\u2019s because unlike events that are about to unfold in Catalonia, this tie is very much in the balance, thanks to a first-leg second half in which Bayern, 2-0 up in Turin, continuously fluffed their lines in front of goal and uncharacteristically let in two the other end, with Juve\u2019s Paulo Dybala and Stefano Sturaro salvaging a 2-2 draw for the Old Lady. Bayern Munich will still fancy themselves as the favourites. They have the away goals, they have home advantage, they have Pep Guardiola. But what they might not have is a one Arjen Robben \u2013 who scored the most Arjen Robben goal of all time in the first leg, an R2 Fifa special, cutting in on off the right flank, feinting to shoot a couple of times before \u2026 you know the rest \u2013 who is a doubt with a cold. A cold. Holger Badstuber, Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng are all out, meaning that David Alaba and the young-but-impressive Joshua Kimmich \u2013 look set for another night in central defence together. Juventus, meanwhile, have doubts and absentees of their own. Their best defender Giorgio Chiellini and arguably their most potent attacker Paulo Dybala are notably joined on the sidelines by Claudio Marchisio and Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres. Ouch. Gianluigi Buffon will have to live up to his Superman tag to keep Robert Lewandowski, Thomas M\u00fcller and Douglas Costa at bay but for a man that hasn\u2019t conceded in the last 10 Serie A matches \u2013 926 minutes \u2013 that might not be an impossible task. Juve only need one more clean sheet, one more goal and they are through. Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT, 8.45pm in Munich"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
