This confused, nearly-indescribable film stars Hugh Jackman as Tomas, a conquistador in 16th-century Mexico, a present-day American scientist called Tommy Creo (cryogenics, geddit?) and a 26th-century astronaut, all searching for eternal life. Coming after the impressive Pi and Requiem for a Dream and costing 10 times as much as the two put together, this is a serious setback. The key line, spoken by a Mayan priest, is 'Death is the road to awe', and this movie truly puts the 'awe' into awful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
