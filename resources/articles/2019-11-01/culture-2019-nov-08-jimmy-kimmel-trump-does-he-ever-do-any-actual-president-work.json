Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host mentioned that this week makes three years since Trump was voted into office. \u201cIt\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since,\u201d he joked. Kimmel continued: \u201cTrump plans to celebrate the anniversary tomorrow by playing golf then making love to an overcooked steak with ketchup on it.\u201d On three separate occasions in the last week, Trump has used the word \u201cfoistered\u201d during rallies, a word that he appears to have invented. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of foisted and forced which also happens to be his two favourite ways to meet women,\u201d Kimmel quipped. He then moved onto a new report in the Washington Post which claims that Trump\u2019s attorney general, Bill Barr, refused to take part in a press conference about the Ukraine call. Trump responded with a number of \u201crage-tweets\u201d aimed at the paper. \u201cDoes he ever do any actual president work? Or is it all just rallies and tweets now?\u201d Kimmel asked. In one of the tweets, Trump criticised the media for not using fact-checkers anymore. \u201cDonald Trump claiming the media doesn\u2019t fact-check is like R Kelly calling Chris Brown a creep,\u201d he joked. A vote on impeachment might happen before Christmas although Kimmel has a better idea. \u201cWhy not do it on Christmas?\u201d he said. \u201cThat way we can start a new tradition of rewatching it every year.\u201d The basis of the inquiry is Trump trying to get information that didn\u2019t even exist in the first place. \u201cTrump tried to pull off a heist on a casino with no money in it, like a Trump casino,\u201d Kimmel said. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert started with some good news: Stephen Miller is getting married. \u201cWow, love truly is blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate the happy couple and if you want to give them a gift they are registered at and it just says snakes, I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d He also spoke about Barr\u2019s refusal to assist the president. \u201cBill Barr refused to publicly defend the president?\u201d he said. \u201cSomething is seriously wrong. That\u2019s like Nicolas Cage turning down a movie role.\u201d Colbert then moved onto the angry tweets that followed the Washington Post report. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to make sure a story about Trump and that\u2019s if he rage-tweets his denial,\u201d he said. During a recent rally, Trump said to his audience that they probably couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else they would rather be at that moment. Colbert had other ideas: \u201cThe DMV, the dentist, someone else\u2019s child\u2019s clarinet recital, a Soviet gulag, covered in honey and staked to an ant hill, sliding down a 50ft razor blade into a bathtub of gun and in conversation with someone who knows a lot about Bitcoin.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about Trump\u2019s use of the word foistered. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t make errors he makes discoveries,\u201d he joked. Meyers continued: \u201cHe sounds like Daffy Duck trying to say faster.\u201d He claimed that Trump is \u201csurrounded by so many sycophants\u201d that no one would correct him before playing footage of Lindsey Graham also making a number of mistakes on a recent Fox News interview. \u201cTrump and Graham sound like two guys leaving a bar at 4am arguing who should drive home,\u201d he said. The last week has also seen two Democratic governors win in Kentucky and Virginia which has led to a Republican source stating that this could be a bad omen for 2020. \u201cYou guys really needed an omen to tell you things were not looking good?\u201d Meyers said. \u201cRepublicans are like Ancient Egyptians trying to predict the seasons.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
