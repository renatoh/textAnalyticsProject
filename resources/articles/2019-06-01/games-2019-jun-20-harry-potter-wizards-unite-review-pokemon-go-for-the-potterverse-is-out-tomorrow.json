Players use their phones to tackle something called the Calamity, which has tossed all sorts of dangerous magic \u2013 Confoundables \u2013 into the everyday world of muggles. Exploring the real world around them, they\u2019ll run into familiar forms for fans of the Potterverse, such as pixies guarding screaming Howler letters or Hogwarts students trapped by vines. Casting spells on them by tracing lines on the phone\u2019s screen will send them back where they belong, adding to the player\u2019s collection of magical objects fished from the streets. Anybody who ever headed out to hunt critters in Niantic\u2019s previous mega-hit, Pok\u00e9mon Go, will see the similarities in Wizards Unite. Pok\u00e9stops, for instance, become Inns, where you can gather spellcasting energy rather than Pok\u00e9balls. After levelling a few times, players will be asked whether they want to become an Auror, a magical zoologist, or a professor. Each path has its own skills that you can develop as you continue to play. \u201cSome skills are focused on you as an individual, for example improving the way that you explore the map,\u201d says Alex Moffit, a producer at developer Niantic. \u201cBut a lot of the skills that I think are most interesting involve collaboration \u2026 I can actually cast abilities on my fellow witches and wizards, help heal them, give them a boost.\u201d Wizards Unite does \u201csome things new, some things old, some things better,\u201d says Moffit. One of these things is the ability to brew potions, which will give you advantages in tough fights. You can find ingredients by walking around, and they will vary based on your location and even the weather conditions, or you can grow them in greenhouses scattered around the world. Of course, as in Pok\u00e9mon Go, you can also buy energy, potions, and other things like cosmetics using real money. Spending is never obligatory, but how easy the game is to play will depend on how packed your home neighbourhood is with Inns or other encounters. One journalist at this week\u2019s preview event in LA ran out of spellcasting energy even in the bustling Universal Studios, where Inns and encounters were clustered so that several of each were within reach. However, the game is nowhere near as money-grubbing as last year\u2019s Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. You\u2019ll probably need to use potions \u2013 brewed or bought \u2013 to tackle the game\u2019s tougher challenges. The toughest in the game are fortresses and, like Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s raid battles, you\u2019ll need to group together with other players to attempt them. Some encounters are trickier than others, and may not be possible at all until you\u2019ve levelled up a bit. Sometimes enemies will fight back, and you\u2019ll need to cast Protego or fail. Rarer encounters also drop hints about the plot, which Moffit envisions running \u201cfor 10 years\u201d, though at the moment it\u2019s \u201cabstract\u201d and ready to \u201cchange, shift and react\u201d based on fan feedback. Three years after its launch, Pok\u00e9mon Go maintains a dedicated community of millions. Moffit believes that the Potter fanbase\u2019s \u201cenergy and enthusiasm\u201d could mean big things for Wizards Unite. At the preview event at Los Angeles\u2019 Universal Studios, it wasn\u2019t hard to see why. Long before selected press and Potter fans arrived, the park\u2019s Potter-themed street, lined with rides and themed shops from the wizarding universe, was bustling with kids and adults wearing robes, waving wands and taking photographs of Hogwarts. Players can take a selfie and dress it up with themed filters and stickers, such as a Hogwarts house border or Harry\u2019s iconic glasses and lightning-bolt scar. Fan-favourite characters do make an appearance in the game, though Moffit says there is a \u201ctightrope\u201d balance between bringing in familiar faces and letting players embody themselves as witches and wizards in the world. \u201cYou have to be yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody can\u2019t be Harry, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u201cFans are huge experts already,\u201d Moffit says. \u201cEverybody already knows how to cast spells. You may not think you\u2019ve ever cast a spell before but you see them and you\u2019re like \u2018Oh, I know what this is, I know Incendio, I know Alohamora.\u2019\u201d And when you do run into a recognisable character, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s Ron from the Quidditch pitch, mid-dive with some Confoundable around him, it\u2019s pretty cool because it doesn\u2019t happen all that often.\u201d Though the preview event saw a few crashes, disconnects and long loading screens, it was enjoyable to explore and encounter all manner of familiar magic and mystery. Getting to experience and interact with the wizarding world superimposed over our own will surely be exciting for fans who want to return to Harry\u2019s world. Pok\u00e9mon Go players will feel the similarities, but may enjoy the added complexity of Wizards Unite \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly launching in a better state than Pok\u00e9mon Go did in 2016. The app launches in the United Kingdom and the United States on Friday, 21 June, with a staggered roll-out for the rest of the world. It\u2019s downloadable for free."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
