Mark Ravenhill\u2019s new play is less optimistic and more partisan than Mike Bartlett\u2019s Snowflake, but nonetheless has the same ability to show how private lives can intertwine with public issues. The cane of the title is a palpable object and a potent metaphor. Edward, a deputy head on the verge of retirement after 45 years, finds his home besieged by pupils demonstrating against his historic role in institutionalised corporal punishment. His wife, Maureen, veers between loyal ally and bullied victim, while his long-rejected daughter, Anna, turns up seeking to calm the situation and conceivably, as part of a local academy, make a bid for Edward\u2019s failing school. It seems unlikely that the police would ignore a public riot and, although Edward takes refuge in the fact that he was simply following school rules, he clearly represents a world of patriarchal authority. But Ravenhill is a subtle enough writer to show that Edward\u2019s power has its limitations: he needs his daughter\u2019s help in compiling a report for the school inspectors and his wife\u2019s aid in climbing a ladder to the attic. While Anna stands for liberal values, her constant use of phrases such as \u201cbest practice\u201d and \u201cpupil voice\u201d suggests she has also inherited her father\u2019s inflexible belief in systems. At 105 minutes, Ravenhill\u2019s play is short, tense, provocative and very well directed by Vicky Featherstone. Chloe Lamford\u2019s design, with its rotting staircase and looming attic, evokes a house that is both barren and besieged, and the acting is exemplary. Even if Alun Armstrong can\u2019t arouse much sympathy for Edward, he shifts brilliantly between a schoolmasterly rationality and inexplicable rage. Maggie Steed captures exactly his wife\u2019s enforced subjugation, and Nicola Walker skilfully suggests that the daughter\u2019s progressive instincts mask a streak of cruelty. In the list of works about retiring teachers, this is a long way from Rattigan\u2019s The Browning Version, but Ravenhill\u2019s play directly confronts our present concerns with abuses of power. The Cane is at the Royal Court, London, until 26 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
