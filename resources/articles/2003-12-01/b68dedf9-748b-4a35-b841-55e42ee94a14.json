Capita, the privately-run company hired by ministers to run the CRB, will implement the \u00a34 rise in April. It will represent a 133% rise in the cost of a standard check, or \"disclosure\", since last June. Ministers have also proposed that the \"registered bodies\" - such as hospitals and schools - that apply for checks on staff should do more of the initial work and pay an annual fee of \u00a3300. They should be responsible for properly checking the identity of applicants and for ensuring their forms are fully and accurately completed, ministers said. The suggestion was made in draft proposed regulations published for consultation today, along with the idea of a \"central assurance team\" to help the bodies meet the new requirements, funded by the annual fee. Home Office minister Hazel Blears said organisations would see the disclosure fee as \"a price worth paying\" for the additional protection it afforded against abuse of the vulnerable. \"There is clear evidence that the disclosure service is offering improved protection for children and vulnerable adults,\" she said. \"In a survey earlier this year nearly one in five organisations that used the service have declined to employ someone as a result of information contained in a disclosure. \"The government has made it clear that the CRB will achieve full cost recovery by 2005-06,\" she added. \"The proposed regulations set out today for consultation will strengthen the role of registered bodies. Making registered bodies responsible for checking the identity of applicants and that their forms are properly completed will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the disclosure process.\" The new fees will be \u00a328 for standard disclosures, compared with \u00a312 last June, or \u00a333 for the more detailed level of check. Deputy chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, Marcia Roberts, said it meant the CRB was doing \"less work for more money\". \"It is simply not good enough for the CRB to put up their fees again whilst devolving greater responsibility for checks to registered bodies,\" she said. \"The CRB is simply doing less work for more money which is totally unacceptable. They are holding great swathes of the UK labour force to ransom and all because someone did their sums wrong on how it could be funded two years ago.\" By November 15, the CRB had issued 2.8 million disclosures, with 1,137 applications more than six weeks old compared to a peak of 76,000, according to Home Office figures. The CRB was set up in March 2002 to check that people working with children or vulnerable adults did not have criminal backgrounds. For the past five months, both levels of vetting - standard and enhanced - were meeting the target of 90% processed within two and four weeks, a Home Office spokesman said. Volunteers will continue to receive checks free of charge, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
