The bank is believed to be willing to dispose of C&amp;G's branch network or even the entire business if it helps placate any anticompetitive concerns held by the regulator. Lloyds will also say it will spark a war for current accounts if it is given the go-ahead for the Abbey bid. The competition commission has until June 12 to prepare its report for the Department of Trade and Industry on whether the move for Abbey raises competition concerns. It is holding what is ex pected to be its final meetings with the two banks today to discuss the \"hypothetical\" remedies which could be deployed to counter any competition concerns. Denise Kingsmill, the deputy competition commissioner, is understood to have intimated to both parties that if she and her team conclude the takeover would cause serious anticompetitive threats then the commission is likely to conclude that none of the remedies will suffice. This means the bid would be blocked. Among the remedies which have been suggested are selling branches and making undertakings to maintain certain types of products. The competition commission has already made it clear to both parties that it is aware of a potential change to the financial services industry as a result of the merger between Halifax and Bank of Scotland which was announced after the inquiry began. Halifax and BoS have positioned their merger as creating a fifth force to take on the big four - of which Lloyds TSB is a leading member - particularly in the area of current accounts where the four have a 70% market share. Lloyds TSB is thought to be prepared to revamp its current account range to offer a range of products paying tiered interest rates. Along with other members of the big four it currently pays 0.1% on the majority of its accounts in credit. It is also expected to pledge to keep the Abbey National range of products available for at least two years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
