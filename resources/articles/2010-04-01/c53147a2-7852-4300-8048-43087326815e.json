As the committee's chairman Edward Leigh, quoted in your report, points out: \"In the UK, one person in 10 is struggling to manage his or her debts and the total of all consumer debt is enormous, some \u00a31,500bn.\" But while his committee is right to highlight the need for a comprehensive government review of solutions for tackling the UK's chronic consumer debt problem, it is mistaken in some of its conclusions. Your article draws attention to the committee's assertion that \"millions of consumers needing advice and practical help in managing and reducing overdraft and credit card debts are losing out because of the failure to manage and target the scheme at those in most need\". This was true at one time, but things have moved on. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service, working closely with Citizens Advice and National Debtline, is providing free debt advice to hundreds of thousands of people who are struggling with unmanageable debt. The new CCCS arrangement for debtors who suffer an unexpected \"income shock\" such as redundancy or illness \u2013 which allows them to make minimal token payments until their circumstances improve \u2013 is an example of the innovative way it is responding to the new needs of those struggling with debt. The committee errs in suggesting there is a need to expand the role of for-profit companies in providing advice and support. Paying for debt advice is costly and unnecessary when free advice is available. As you state, the committee points out that \"face-to-face advice costs an average of \u00a3265 for each person\", and \"recommends directing consumers to cheaper telephone and internet advice services\". Its report says telephone advice costs just \u00a351 per consumer and internet advice is cheaper still. Unfortunately, however, the Treasury does not permit the funds it provides for face-to-face advice to be used for telephone or internet counselling, even though they are cheaper and preferred by many users. If the allocation of the funds reflected how people chose to be helped, more support could be given for the same cost. CCCS provides debt advice online, over the phone and face-to-face; and online debt counselling is increasingly popular. Last year, over 150,000 people sought help using this free and anonymous source of debt advice, almost two-thirds more than in 2008, and we expect the numbers seeking help online to exceed those contacting our phone helplines by the end of 2010. Last year saw the UK's personal debt pain largely deferred, but it is likely that more households will come unstuck this year \u2013 whatever happens to the economy. It is crucial that those who find themselves in this situation have access to free, impartial and independent advice in whichever way is best for them: online, over the phone or face-to-face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
