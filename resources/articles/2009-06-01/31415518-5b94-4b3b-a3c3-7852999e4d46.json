Walter and Gwendolyn Myers were so well regarded by Havana that several years ago they were rewarded with a secret meeting with Fidel Castro in Mexico. But they were caught after an FBI sting in which they were duped into telling an undercover agent about their work. David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, said the couple's alleged spying was \"incredibly serious\". The government said their motive appears to have been ideology, not money. Walter Myers, 72, joined the state department in 1977 as a part-time worker but, at Havana's direction, sought full time work a few years later and given clearance to top secret information working for its Bureau of Intelligence and Research until he retired two years ago. His wife worked as an analyst at a Washington DC bank. The couple married in 1982. According to a justice department affidavit released today , US authorities launched an investigation after an analysis of Myers' state department computer revealed he sought access to more than 200 classified intelligence reports on Cuba during his last year at the state department. The requests were not related to his work as an analyst on European affairs. An FBI agent posing as a Cuban spy told Myers he had been sent by Havana to obtain information on an upcoming regional summit in April at which Cuba was to be a major issue. Myers and his wife then revealed some of their past activities on behalf of the Cuban government and agreed to provide information about officials in the new American administration responsible for Latin American policy. Walter Myers told the undercover FBI officer, who at one point offered him a Cuban cigar, that he had received \"lots of medals\" from the Cuban government. The indictment says that Myers transmitted information to Cuba via shortwave radio in Morse code and more recently in encrypted emails. In recent years, the Cubans supplied him with an encoding machine. Gwendolyn Myers also passed secret messages to Cuban spies by hand. She told the FBI that her favourite place to hand them over was in Washington grocery stores. The couple regularly travelled to Latin America and the Caribbean to meet Cuban agents. On a 1995 trip to Mexico they had a clandestine meeting with Castro. The two are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government and to communicate classified information to Havana. They are also charged with wire fraud. Both could spend the rest of their lives in prison if convicted. The indictment says Walter Myers was approached by Cuban officials in 1978 and that the couple began spying almost immediately. At Havana's direction he applied for jobs that would give him access to classified information. Myers apparently sympathised with the Cuban ideology and revolution that put Castro into power. Court documents say he wrote in a personal journal in 1978: \"I can see nothing of value that has been lost by the revolution\u2026 [The] revolution has released enormous potential and liberated the Cuban spirit.\" He praised Castro as \"brilliant and charismatic\" and \"one of the great political leaders of our time\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
