It also expresses concern about the treatment of any detainees handed over to the Afghans by British forces, and the prospect of a lack of air cover to protect troops on the ground. From next month more than 3,000 British soldiers will be based in Helmand province for a potentially dangerous mission maintaining security, training the Afghan army, and countering narcotics. In a report published today, the Commons defence committee describes the security situation in Helmand as \"increasingly fragile\". Helmand, it notes, is a \"power base for supporters of the deposed Taliban regime and contains areas of significant poppy cultivation\". It warns of the danger of British forces being attacked by groups seeking to protect their interests. But the committee says it supports the objectives of the British deployment in Afghanistan, the source of about 90% of heroin in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
