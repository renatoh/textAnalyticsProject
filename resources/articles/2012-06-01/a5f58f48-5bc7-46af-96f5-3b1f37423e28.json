As the costs of renewable power continue to fall, it is right that the support they receive does, too, and the deal struck by Chris Huhne with David Cameron to cut that by 10% was justified. Yet onshore wind is the lowest-cost renewable technology, so slashing its support by 25% would seriously jeopardise new projects, including community-owned initiatives. The Environmental Audit Committee called on the government to show leadership on the green economy, in the same week that it emerged that William Hague had written to the prime minister to say exactly the same thing. We're now seeing repeated calls from inside government and from business to stop the Treasury blocking green growth and provide policy certainty for the development of the renewable energy sector. All of which raises the question: are the Liberal Democrats, whose voters are identifiably green, and energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey trying and failing to fight for their own party's green policies \u2013 or do they agree with undermining the wind industry? John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace UK Andy Atkins Executive director, Friends of the Earth UK David Nussbaum Chief executive, WWF UK The claim by the industry that a 25% cut in the subsidies to onshore windfarms would \"kill dead\" the development demonstrates how ridiculous continued spending on such a short-term and inefficient source of power wind turbines really are. If the government really wanted to demonstrate green credentials, it should cut the subsidies to windfarms by 100% and use the money to increase research into tidal power, the only long-term, plentiful, continuously available and truly green power there is. IJ Gibson Ullapool, Ross-shire The attempt by George Osborne to cut the subsidy to onshore windfarms indicates that the government's energy policy is in disarray. Although Osborne is bowing to pressure from rightwing Tories, a recent poll shows that seven out of 10 people in the UK support the development of windfarms. It is unfortunate that governments try to interfere with the renewable market by subsidising some forms of renewable more than others, whereas the sensible approach would be to provide an equal feed-in tariff for all sources and leave the market to decide whether it wishes to pursue wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydro etc. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Chair, Planetary SOS Stoke Poges, Bucks The government has a challenging, but legally binding, renewables target \u2013 and it should meet it in the most cost-effective way it can. Support levels for the cheapest renewables should only be reduced if it won't slow deployment of those technologies. The new levels of financial support for renewables were due out by the end of May. Instead, we have delay as Osborne wants to cut the levels paid to onshore wind. This is irresponsible and risks undermining investor confidence and pushing up costs unnecessarily. Gaynor Hartnell Chief executive, Renewable Energy Association, London SE1 The government is spending billions of pounds on new nuclear submarines, a new arsenal of nuclear weapons, the armed forces, two gigantic aircraft carriers we do not need, support ships for the aircraft carriers. At the same time, it is cutting back on the provision of sustainable energy, child support and housing support grants, libraries, post offices and community centres. It is said we get the leaders we deserve. We deserve a whole lot better than this. Jim McCluskey Twickenham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
