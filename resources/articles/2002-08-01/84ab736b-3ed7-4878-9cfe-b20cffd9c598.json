It was the profligacy of Deon Burton that denied the visitors maximum points although it was his goal that cancelled out Peter Ndlovu's earlier effort for Sheffield United. Pleading poverty is the vogue in the Nationwide League following the collapse of the ITV Digital contract, but Portsmouth have less need that most for concern. The personal fortune of their chairman Milan Mandaric bankrolls the club and Redknapp has the magnetic ability to attract better than average First Division performers to the club as Merson and Shaka Hislop demonstrate. Redknapp's Sheffield United counterpart Neil Warnock may not enjoy such financial support but what his team lack in ability they more than cmake up for in effort. They drew first blood here when some poor defending from Matthew Taylor enabledthe transfer-listed Ndlovu to thread an angled shot beyond Hislop. Merson may have taken a substantial pay-cut after moving from Aston Villa, but he is still rich in talent as he showed in the 25th minute. The former England player's casual flick set up Portsmouth's equaliser, Burton rounding United's keeper Paddy Kenny to collect his second goal in in four days. Burton, on a month's loan from Derby County, is another with Premiership qualities and should have underlined Portsmouth's supremacy with a hat-trick, but a free-header went hideously awry before he was denied from close-range by Kenny, after the keeper could only fend away Nigel Quashie's venomous shot from long range. Merson's influence grew with every touch and he had an audacious 58th minute lob clawed to safety by Kenny's fingernails, but too often he was left frustrated by his newly acquired team-mates' inability to rise to his high standards, apart from Hislop, who had to be equally alert to prevent powerful attempts by Robert Kozluk and Michael Brown restoring United's early advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
