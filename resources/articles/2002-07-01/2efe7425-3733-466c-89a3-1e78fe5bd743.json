The 23-year-old Italian lost control of his Honda on the exit from a slow corner during the unofficial practice session yesterday and was hurled over the handlebars. He was taken to hospital in Nottingham with a fractured left thumb, but scans showed that he had not suffered head injuries. Rossi, who is heading for his fourth world title with a massive 62-point lead in the MotoGP championship, missed the afternoon's timed session but is expected to be fit today to take his last opportunity to qualify for the 75-mile race. His team-mate, Tohru Ukawa of Japan, also crashed heavily, destroying his bike at the Craner Curves and injuring his back, and is unlikely to race. Based on advance ticket sales of 35,000, more than 50,000 fans - the biggest crowd at a motorcycle grand prix in Britain for a decade - are expected to see the race at the 2.5-mile Leicestershire circuit. They will be cheering for the oldest rider in grand prix racing, the 38-year-old Ulsterman Jeremy McWilliams, who finished an encouraging sixth in yesterday's preliminary qualifying session. \"This would put me on the second row, so tomorrow I'll be trying for the front row,\" said McWilliams, whose 500cc two-stroke Proton KR machine has up to 50bhp less than some rival bikes in the new MotoGP class, which is open to four-stroke bikes of up to 1,000cc. If Rossi makes his antici pated start, tomorrow will be his 100th grand prix. But rivals including yesterday's fastest qualifier, the Spaniard Carlos Checa, will seek to exploit any hangover from his crash and prevent him from scoring his fourth win at Donington. In the 125cc class the 15-year-old British schoolboy Chaz Davies recorded his best qualifying position of the season, 17th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
