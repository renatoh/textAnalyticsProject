But the latest football magazine on newstands, Football Punk - from the Golf Punk stable - is aiming to challenge Four Four Two for the title \"thinking man's soccer mag\" with some daring content - including \"at home with\" interviews that wouldn't look out of place in Hello! or OK! Football Punk kicks off this week with a taste of what's to come, including a cosy t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp over tea at Pompey. Key to the magazine's appeal, according to the editor, Ian Cruise, will be the encyclopedic contacts book of its owner and editor-at-large, former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland defender Phil Babb. \"It's an amazing asset to have someone on board with that access,\" said Cruise, former deputy editor of the more conventionally laddish Shoot, which was axed by IPC Media in June. \"There's an awful lot of football in the media, but much of it's fairly straight stuff from press conferences. What I've found is that, if you get footballers on to subjects other than who they're playing next, they're happy to talk about them,\" he added. \"Phil went to have tea with Harry Redknapp and caught him very relaxed. It produced a lively, jocular piece. There's a lot of stuff written about footballers as footballers, but this will be about footballers as people.\" Initially, Football Punk will be given away as a supplement with the next four issues of Golf Punk, but a newsstand launch is planned for January as part of a major rollout of the \"Punk\" brand under Babb, whose publishing company, JF Media, saved it from oblivion two years ago. With licensed versions of Golf Punk already available in 11 countries besides the UK - including China and the Philippines - October sees the arrival of Golf Punk Lite, a 32-page digest of highlights from the paid-for title's four-year back catalogue, to be distributed free at airports. Both Football Punk and Golf Punk Lite are being managed by Jonathan Richards, a former Northern &amp; Shell executive whose credits include both licensed Liverpool and Arsenal magazines, and OK!, which he launched to beat Hello! at its own game. Richards conceded that his latest challenge has echoes of that earlier face-off, saying: \"We're adding to, and stimulating, a market that's been dominated by one player for too long.\" But as they enter a notoriously tough market that's sunk many pretenders, are these punks getting too big for their boots? Hugh Sleight, editor of Four Four Two, thinks so: \"In our 14 years a lot of football magazines have come and gone, but we're still standing. Everyone thinks they can make a great football magazine but, as history shows, not many do.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
