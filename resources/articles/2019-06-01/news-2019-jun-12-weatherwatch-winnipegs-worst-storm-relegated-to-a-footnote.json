Anything more than 74mph is hurricane-strength. Although news reports described the event as a hurricane or a cyclone, this was neither, just an unusually powerful summer storm. That June was a notably hot one in Winnipeg. It was 3C above average, and extremely humid. Such conditions carry large amounts of moisture to high altitude, and are ideal for storm formation. A major storm was no surprise, but few could have expected miles of telephone and power lines to be brought down and power plants damaged. The unprecedented wind tore the roofs off several buildings, including a children\u2019s hospital. Parked cars tumbled over and were blown across Main Street. Eaton\u2019s department store, the biggest in Winnipeg, had six large plate glass windows broken. The only injuries seem to have been suffered by a couple in a car struck by flying debris. Dramatic as it was, the storm attracted little attention, being overshadowed by more momentous events. Winnipeg was in the throes of a general strike, later recognised as one of the most important in Canadian labour history. The record-breaking storm was relegated to a footnote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
