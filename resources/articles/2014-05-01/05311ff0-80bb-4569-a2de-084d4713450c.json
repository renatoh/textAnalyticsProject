A tenor belting out Return to Sorrento and Volare in the gloaming by the city hall; a bevy of mountain bikers in vast pink wigs and pink tops denoting their membership of Ards Club di Ciclismo; or pink clad traders amid the Victorian ironwork of St George's Market, where a variety of Giro merchandise was being flogged on Friday alongside Armagh bramley apples, second-hand green glass poison bottles \u2013 \u00a35 each \u2013 and pink doughnuts. The waitresses in one bar here swapped en masse from black to pink tops in the brief gap between serving fry-ups for breakfast and mid-morning lattes, underlining that while the roseate razzamatazz is all very well, normality will be restored on Monday morning with an abrupt chill to match the rain showers blowing down off the Black Mountain. That in turn prompted the question: what will remain after the Giro other than a warm glow once the caravan departs? The Tour de France's 1998 visit to Ireland was a popular success but left no legacy in cycling terms. These are different times, however, because there is far more to build on at present. The Tour's visit was a celebration of past glories \u2013 the achievements of Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly in the 1980s \u2013 whereas in this Giro Daniel Martin and Nicolas Roche have a chance of finishing in the top 10 overall, while Philip Deignan can also be expected to play a role in the next few weeks' racing. They are not the only riders of Irish descent in the field, as Roche's Saxo-Tinkoff team boasts another: the 22-year-old Chris Juul-Jensen has Danish parents, but was born in Co Wicklow where he spent his first 15 years. A former member of the Sorrento Cycling Club, he lived in Kilmacanogue, once the home of Shay Elliott, the pioneer of Irish professional cycling in Europe and the first Irishman to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. Juul-Jensen moved to Denmark to further his cycling career, but there are openings for young Irish cyclists, one of which is the An Post-Chain Reaction squad, a team backed by Sean Kelly which is based in Belgium and is registered as a continental squad, two tiers below the top. An Post provided the stepping stone for the most promising young Irishman of the moment, the sprinter Sam Bennett who won a stage at the Tour of Britain last year and has shown well this season after moving up a division to the NetApp team. Their promising young riders this year include Conor Dunne and Ryan Mullen. On paper there is a script for the weekend's three stages \u2013 victory in team time-trial for a strong squad such as Orica-GreenEdge, winners at the discipline in last year's Tour de France and here fielding a team packed with strong young talents such as Michael Hepburn and Luke Durbridge who have emerged from the Australian team-pursuit squad. Usually in a Grand Tour an opening team time-trial should be followed by two days of controlled racing ending in mass sprint finishes on the road-race stages finishing in Belfast on Saturday and Dublin on Sunday. There remains speculation, however, that the weather may intervene; a strong breeze was buffeting Belfast in the buildup to Friday's team time-trial and further wind and rain was forecast for the weekend. \"Given the weather we could have for the first three days, this a very tough start to the Giro,\" said the race director, Mauro Vegni. \"If it's as windy as it's been in the past few days, there's the chance that a contender who's hoping to build form as the race goes on could get caught out.\" \"When I think of wind, I always think of the echelons in Belgium and northern France, but since we've arrived here, everyone's been talking about the wind and I've realised that it's probably stronger here than in Belgium,\" said Nicolas Roche before the race start. \"I didn't really see it as something that could have an impact on the race on Saturday, but the more I think about it, the more I realise that it could have an effect. There are teams who might be tempted to try something. The roads here aren't the widest and there mightn't be room for everybody to get in the echelon. Anything can happen at the Giro, even on the second day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
