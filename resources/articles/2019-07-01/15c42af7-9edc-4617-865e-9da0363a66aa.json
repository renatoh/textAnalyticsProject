Speaking at an immigration town hall in her home district, the New York Democrat also called for the abolishment of the Department of Homeland Security and discussed her belief that Donald Trump should be impeached. It \u201cchills me to my core\u201d, she said, to think about the impact Trump administration immigration policy has had on the lives of thousands of children. Thousands of children were separated from their parents at the southern border last year, under a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy meant to deter migrants from Central America. The policy was dropped amid international outcry but its effects have been lasting: an unknown number of children have been separated from their families. \u201cEven if you separate a kid from their parents for two days you have already created life long lasting trauma,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, speaking to about 250 people at the Nancy DeBenedittis school in Corona, Queens. \u201cAnd there are children who have been separated that we have reunified, and it took about a year to reunify some of these kids with their parents. Lifelong trauma for which we, the United States, are responsible.\u201d She continued: \u201cAnd it chills me to my core to think about 20 years from now, when these kids grow up, the story that they will have about America. That is exactly why we cannot allow this administration to define immigration policy within the United States. This is something that I think is going to have to take a 9/11-style commission.\u201d When there is a Democratic Senate and a Democratic presidency, Ocasio-Cortez said, the government should convene a special commission into child separation, aiming to reunify as many children as possible and to find out every detail of what happened. The body she was proposing, she said, would work \u201cjust like the 9/11 commission did when they said what went wrong?\u201d before the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. \u201cThe 9/11 commission,\u201d she said, \u201cthey were charged with the investigating and making sure they dug out every nook and cranny of what happened and how it happened in our system. And I think that that kind of study is what\u2019s going to be required in order to reunite as many children with their parents as possible. That\u2019s the work that we have to do.\u201d Her remarks met with loud applause. The US has a \u201clifelong commitment\u201d to the children it separated, she said, adding: \u201cI believe we have responsibility to provide mental healthcare services to those children for the rest of their lives.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is one of four Democratic congresswomen who were instructed last week by Trump to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. Back home, she started the town hall by saying to cheers and applause: \u201cThey sent me back to Queens and I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d There was a strong police presence and bags were searched on entry. Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThere is an elevated safety issue that we now have because of the president. But more importantly, it\u2019s about our community.\u201d Outside, protesters held banners with messages including \u201cAmerica hater Ocasio-Cortez\u201d and \u201cThank God for Trump\u201d. Inside, supporters did their best to make her feel at home. A huge line formed. Among those waiting for selfies were self-professed \u201cAOC groupies\u201d and campaign volunteers Tammy Rose, 46, an early childhood educator, Rhoda Dunn, a real estate worker, and student Nuala Naranjo, 18. Dunn said: \u201cWe want her to know that she\u2019s doing a great job. I think she was amazing on how she confronted Trump on his racism, and I think it\u2019s important to give it a name.\u201d Rose added: \u201cShe gets attacked a lot when she\u2019s in DC. She stands up for us there. When she comes home, she needs to know that we\u2019re here standing up for her.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
