Are gay rams really a problem in the sheep industry?", "bodyText": "A breeding ram has only one job. What if he can\u2019t perform? \u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019ll have to go into the food chain,\u201d said Dewi Jones, the chief executive of the sheep-breeding company Innovis, speaking on a Channel 4 documentary, My Gay Dog and Other Animals, which will be broadcast on Thursday. The show reports that one in 12 sheep is gay. \u201cThere is ram-on-ram behaviour going on over there,\u201d Jones says, watching his rams. Putting three of the male-oriented rams into a pen with a ewe to see which are interested in her, one uninterested ram is classed as a \u201cshy breeder\u201d. \u201cCommercially, it\u2019s a big issue for us as a breeding company or as a ram breeder because we need our rams to cover lots of ewes.\u201d Many species \u2013 including sheep, penguins, monkeys and dolphins \u2013 have been shown to display same-sex preferences. Perhaps the most famous example came to light in 2014, when Benji, a Charolais bull in County Mayo, Ireland, was due to be slaughtered after showing no interest in the heifers he was bought to breed with. Campaigners raised money to send him to a sanctuary instead (although it emerged the following year that he may not be \u201cgay\u201d after all, \u201cjudging by what he was trying to do the other day with one of the cows,\u201d said his new owner). Sex preferences in sheep have been studied by Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, whose work suggests their sexuality is determined by biology and has said that the research \u2013 previously reported by the website Slate under the headline \u201cBrokeback Mutton\u201d \u2013 may \u201callow better selection of rams for breeding and as a consequence may be economically important to the sheep industry\u201d. \u201cIt is reasonably well known that male sheep are influenced by early-life experience and rearing practices which can affect their sexual behaviour,\u201d says Prof Cathy Dwyer, an expert in animal behaviour at Scotland\u2019s Rural College. \u201cThere is a study that suggests that about 25% of rams that were kept in an all-male group after weaning were not very interested in ewes when first exposed to them.\u201d However, the study didn\u2019t report if they were interested in males instead, she adds. \u201cWe also know that if male lambs are reared by goat nannies they never show an interest in ewes, only female goats. Rams also display broadly similar behaviours towards subordinate males, and male-male mounting is part of play and pre-pubertal behaviour in sheep and lots of other mammals.\u201d Is it a genuine problem for farmers? \u201cI imagine that early rearing with only males would affect initial encounters with ewes, which might not be ideal for farmers,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the animal was not dominant, that might persist.\u201d Phil Stocker, the chief executive of the National Sheep Association, hasn\u2019t heard of rams \u2013 or bulls \u2013 being sent to the slaughterhouse for showing exclusively same-sex preferences. \u201cI can believe that a lot of rams and bulls show interest in each other, but that\u2019s not to the exclusion of them showing an interest in females,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually, the ones with the stronger sex drive are just as interested in males as they are in females. They\u2019ve either got no sex drive or a very high sex drive.\u201d This is played out on farms across the country. \u201cYou often get rams who sniff and ride other rams. Usually that would be at the time of year when ewes are coming into season and their sex drive is starting to increase; they will ride anything. You see that in bulls and even in steers [castrated cattle]. When they smell [females] coming into season, they will ride other cows.\u201d But he adds: \u201cThis is not an issue at all, commercially.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
