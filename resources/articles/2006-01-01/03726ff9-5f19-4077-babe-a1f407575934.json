That was the warning issued by Consumer Direct, a government-funded telephone and online advisory service, which says small print nasties will trip up thousands of people who joined a gym as part of their new year's resolutions. New gym-goers are often oblivious to the fact that many contracts include credit agreements covering membership fees. In many cases these agreements are based on a fixed period of time - typically one to two years. Cancelling a gym membership will not cancel the credit agreement. Consumer Direct's Carol Brady says: \"Don't put your financial fitness at risk in pursuit of physical fitness. If you're joining a gym it's always worth checking the small print. The law relating to gym membership is the same as that for any goods and services. A contract cannot always be cancelled simply because the member has a change of heart. Even life-changing events like moving home, changing job or starting a family may not affect your contract.\" Many of the biggest players, such as Holmes Place and LA Fitness, operate 12-month contracts. Cannons offers a one-month notice period after a minimum of two-months membership. John Lloyd Leisure allows a three-month notice period. Cannons and John Lloyd say they are changing their terms to make them more flexible. Gyms are legally obliged to give copies of contracts to customers who ask for them, so it is possible to double-check your terms and conditions. Ms Brady says: \"The best advice I can give someone who is tied into gym membership and wants to cancel is to read the terms and conditions of the contract before stopping your direct debit. Consumer Direct offers this advice: \u00b7 Don't be pressured into signing the contract immediately - take it away and read it at your leisure. \u00b7 If unsure about your membership terms, you are entitled to see a copy of your contract and the gym is legally obliged to provide it. \u00b7 If you join your gym over the telephone or online you are entitled to a seven-working day \"cooling off\" period. \u00b7 Check the terms for rights to suspend or terminate the membership. \u00b7 If you want to terminate your membership put it in writing, send the notice recorded delivery and keep a copy of all correspondence. \u00b7 You may be able to stop your gym membership within the contract period if the gym fails to provide a satisfactory quality service. \u00b7 If you have a dispute and you are still tied into the contract it is best to keep paying, but do inform the bank and gym that you are paying under protest. \u00b7 Don't stop paying monthly direct debit payments until your membership has concluded. If you do the gym could claim outstanding arrears. \u00b7 Even if your contract is coming to an end, you should still give your gym notice if you do not want to renew your membership. It may be worth keeping a note of key dates in your diary. If you want to cancel and believe the contract is unfair, check the Office of Fair Trading's \"guidance on unfair terms in health and fitness club agreements\" which can be downloaded at oft.gov.uk Consumer Direct is available six days a week on 08454 04 05 06 from 0800-1830 Monday to Friday, and 0900-1300 Saturday. email: p.inman@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
