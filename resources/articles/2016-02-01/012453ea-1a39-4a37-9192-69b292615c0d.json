Sturridge resumed full training at Liverpool on Thursday when it was claimed the England international wants to quit Anfield in response to criticism of his desire to play through the pain barrier. The 26-year-old has not played since 6 December because of a hamstring injury plus a training programme designed to keep him fit for the remainder of the season. He will not be considered for Saturday\u2019s Premier League game with Sunderland at Anfield but is scheduled to return at West Ham, along with fellow recent absentees Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi. Klopp has spoken regularly with Sturridge during his latest recovery and claims the striker has not indicated he wants a move in the summer. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cI have spoken to him but not about this. I didn\u2019t ask him if he wanted to leave. Why should I? It is not a situation to ask him that. He has been in training for two days. I don\u2019t go over and ask \u2019Daniel, I hear you want to leave? Is there truth in it?\u2019 I don\u2019t believe it is like this. If Daniel will come, or another player on another day, and ask me, then I will talk about it but I have no feeling that Daniel is thinking like this so stop thinking about it. \u201cAfter a long, long break, from my understanding, it is not possible anyone can think about leaving because nothing has been said. I answered a few questions at the time he was not fit because of his history. Since I was here I\u2019ve had a normal relationship with Daniel Sturridge. The only problem is I have only had him 10 or 12 times on the training pitch \u2013 that is the truth. So now he is back we hope he can stay in team training and everything will be good. If everything is normal, from now on he is in the race.\u201d Martin Skrtel is expected to be on the sidelines for another two to three weeks after suffering a calf injury during his recovery from a hamstring strain. However, Klopp is hopeful Sturridge, Coutinho and Origi will dramatically improve his attacking options from next Tuesday onwards. He explained: \u201cDivock, Phil and Daniel are in training and you think after five minutes we should put them in the squad but that is the moment when you have to say: \u2018Come on, we have to have another three sessions which we can use and maybe be available for West Ham.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
