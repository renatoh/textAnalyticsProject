Premiership highlights late on a Saturday evening suited the audience. So did an hour and a half of Serie A football on a Sunday afternoon. But was that enough for David Liddiment of ITV or Michael Jackson of C4? Of course not. Thinking about what would look best on their future applications to run the BBC, both programme controllers proved incapable of resisting the urge to make their mark. It would be impossible to quantify the effects on Britain's changing football culture of a decade of Sunday afternoons spent with the body on the couch and the mind in Milan, Parma or Naples, but the ability of a high proportion of football fans to pronounce even the most exotic foreign names would surely be among them. In preparing the ground for the sudden post-Bosman influx of players from other countries, it provided a significant service. And when that job had been completed, the programme still represented a small but significant civilising force in our society. Critics will say that Football Italia struggled over the past couple of seasons to present the most attractive matches, thanks to Serie A's increasing readiness to maximise revenue from pay-TV channels by rescheduling big fixtures. In another respect its primacy was challenged last year by Eurosport's regular live transmissions of attractive matches from the Spanish Liga, featuring football in which a higher premium is placed on entertainment. But now it has gone, its place taken last Sunday by pictures of drizzle falling on a mist-shrouded south London cricket ground. Sundays, as Spanky and Our Gang used to sing in the days when Luigi Riva was banging in the goals for Cagliari, will never be the same. For grieving calciophiles, the compensation is a highlights programme called La Partita, made by the same team and broadcast by Channel 4 after midnight on Sundays. As James Richardson, the presenter, pointed out, this means that they are now able to show extracts from all the weekend's Serie A fixtures, no longer confined to making a selection from the matches kicking off at two o'clock on a Sunday. And however much one mourns the programme it replaces, La Partita provides one remarkable and unexpected service since it turns out to be exactly what the producers of The Premiership should have been doing all along. Its premise is that people switch on to watch a programme of football matches because football is what they want to see. Not mini-features about footballers' lifestyles, not sponsors' wraparounds presenting soundbites edited from the thoughts of players' grannies, not toe-curlingly banal interviews conducted by ex-players, not even twee links from old-smoothie presenters. Here is a football highlights programme from the days before programme controllers became seized by the patronising notion that women might be persuaded to like football too, if it could be served up by chaps they fancied who wouldn't commit the error of saying anything remotely profound or provocative and could be relied on to smile in all circumstances (step forward, Ally McCoist - as if you needed any encouragement). La Partita provides extended highlights from two key games plus the relevant bits from all the others. When a team-sheet appears on the screen, the director dwells on it long enough to allow the viewer to take it in (to ITV this seems like an irksome intrusion and disappears almost before there has been time to absorb the team's formation, never mind the names). When play begins the chief commentator, Peter Brackley, does the job of identifying the individual players and providing useful background information without trying to give the impression that he has recently swallowed a cheap thesaurus. Like the old Football Italia, which restricted the role of former players to that of providing expert summary, La Partita leaves the basic hard work of commentating and interviewing to professionals. In that respect, too, it could hardly be more different from The Premiership, where Andy Townsend is currently being allowed to plumb new depths of grinning vacuousness. Give or take a few of Richardson's more puerile double entendres, La Partita is as close to a perfect package of football highlights as we are likely to get. And you would bet that it will still be occupying its slot at the end of the season, which is more than we dare say for The Premiership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
