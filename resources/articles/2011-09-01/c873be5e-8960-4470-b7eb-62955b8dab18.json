Equal rights \u2013 even better", "bodyText": "Last week, probably for the first time in its history, cohabitation acquired a good name from defenders of the state of matrimony. According to a study for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the key to a strong marriage is to live together first. Cohabitation allegedly screens out those who would otherwise marry and divorce. In the 1950s, fewer than one in 100 adults under 50 cohabited; now it is one in six. In recent years, 80% of couples who marry have lived together first. ONS researchers suggest that cohabitation, because of its test-run potential, is seen as \"promoting rather than competing with marriage\". So, if the terms of engagement have changed, as it were, then it seems only fair to ask that legal rights for cohabitees should once again be considered. Common law marriage hasn't existed in England and Wales since 1753, although more than 50% of the population believe that it does. As a result, at the end of a relationship, the law treats cohabitees as two unrelated individuals with no right to claim for maintenance, except for the children, or a share of the property. Rights for cohabitees were resisted in the past because opponents argued this would undermine marriage. Now cohabitation appears to have become a valuable marital prop, surely it's only fair that those who continue, for a variety of reasons, to resist the orange blossom and nuptials are entitled to a better personal security? Campaigners have fought to win a change in the law and several governments, including this one, have refused to see reason. On the whole, it's those who are poorer, less well-educated and less well-qualified who remain as cohabitees, although that, too, is beginning to change. They live together for a variety of reasons: the partner doesn't want to; they can't afford a wedding; they resist the interference of the state. That's their choice. The fact that, as a result, they and their children are left unfairly vulnerable when Cupid's arrows cease to fly now seems even more unjust."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
