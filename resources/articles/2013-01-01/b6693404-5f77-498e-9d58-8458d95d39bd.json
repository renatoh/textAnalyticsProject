Sworn enemies of it, consider making an exception. This five-disc set repackages Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Billy Cobham's prolific early bandleading years between 1973 and 1975, and it bristles with rock-guitar fireworks, hyperactive drums and synths, and exclamatory James Brown-like horn riffs. But Cobham was, and remains, a subtle musical thinker as well as a phenomenal drummer, and the set harnesses bold ideas, thematic variety, and some awesome soloing from the likes of the Brecker Brothers, guitarists John Abercrombie and John Scofield, and the little-known but gifted Bulgarian keyboardist Milcho Leviev. The earliest session, Spectrum (featuring soon-to-be-Deep Purple guitarist Tommy Bolin), is the leanest and meanest. The next year's Shabazz, live from a European tour, is an often frantically full-throttle affair, but Leviev on synths and a storming Michael Brecker on tenor sax slash through the general rumpus. The cinematic, melodramatic Total Eclipse (1974) is a surprisingly powerful and varied space-travel concept set, with some superb John Abercrombie guitar and Randy Brecker flugelhorn. Sometimes you want to wail \"Make it stop\" \u2013 but for musicality, this collection is streets ahead of where much generic jazz-funk wound up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
