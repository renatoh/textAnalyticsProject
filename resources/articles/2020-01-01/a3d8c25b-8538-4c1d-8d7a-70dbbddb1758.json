Many people were disappointed with London\u2019s show, as smoke obscured the views amid still air. Lack of wind also slowed the dispersion of firework smoke throughout London, creating the year\u2019s first air pollution incident in the capital. It was also the first such incident to be recorded on any New Year\u2019s Day in London since the start of modern measurements of particle pollution in 1993. For four hours, the air was filled with tiny particles of the metals that are used to make firework colours. These included barium, copper and strontium that produce white, green, blue and red colours, along with potassium and chloride that are used as firework propellants. Air pollution from northern France also reached the city later in the day. In 2019 over 300,000 people signed a UK petition to ban the sale of fireworks to the public. New Year\u2019s Day fireworks in Sydney divided public opinion at a time when firefighters were tackling still-burning deadly bushfires and people were losing their homes. Although pre-recorded a few days before, Shanghai\u2019s new year display, with lit drones creating shapes in the sky, may be a more environmentally-friendly, but still spectacular, way to start future new years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
