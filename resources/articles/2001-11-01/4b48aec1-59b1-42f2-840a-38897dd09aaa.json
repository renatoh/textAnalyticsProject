Gibbs made 154 of South Africa's total of 236 for five, but kept losing partners on the way as India's lightweight attack stuck manfully to their task. They were rewarded for their persistence, with Boeta Dippenaar and Lance Klusener both being dismissed in the last six overs to slightly alter the complexion of a day that had been all South Africa's. If India can strike early tomorrow then they are still in the game. Gibbs is enjoying the Indians' visit having made 107 in the first Test in Bloemfontein, and his fifth Test century was full of his characteristic flair. He hit 21 fours and one six, reaching his hundred in 167 balls, without offering a chance. He received scant support from his team-mates however, and only Jacques Kallis (24) and Dippenaar (29) made significant contributions. Gary Kirsten was caught by VS Laxman in the slips off the bowling of Srinath in the seventh over, giving India hope after Sourav Ganguly has won the toss and chosen to field, but Kirsten and Kallis added 70 for the second wicket. Kallis was bowled by Srinath for 24 and Neil Mackenzie beaten by Harbhajan Singh for 12, before Dippenaar joined Gibbs for a partnership worth 105. India bowled well, but suffered from their traditional weakness in the seam department and Ajit Agarkar and Ganguly failed to give Srinath enough support. Agarkar did remove Dippenaar for 29 before Srinath sent Klusener back for 9, but no-one troubled Gibbs, who will have a second double-hundred in his sights when he resumes tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
