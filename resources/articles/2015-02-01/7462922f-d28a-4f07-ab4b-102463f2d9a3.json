Pyne, the education minister and leader of the house, said he did not know whether someone would move a spill motion at the first Liberal party room meeting of the year, but hoped the prime minister would retain the leadership. \u201cMy job is to find out what my colleagues are thinking, and I have been talking to my colleagues and there is obviously some people who are saying that there should be a vote on Tuesday because they said it publicly and they have said it privately,\u201d Pyne told the Nine Network on Friday. \u201cI can\u2019t rule it out. I can tell you this \u2013 I will not be moving a vote on Tuesday in the party room.\u201d Asked whether Abbott had the numbers to survive such a vote, Pyne said: \u201cThat is a very inexact science, but I hope he does.\u201d Pyne\u2019s doubts were widely reported as a sign of waning confidence in Abbott\u2019s prospects. A few hours later, Pyne gave a follow-up interview on Sky News \u201cto clear up any misinterpretation whatsoever\u201d of his \u201centirely unremarkable\u201d comments. Pyne said the media had \u201ccompletely overreacted\u201d and he reiterated that he did not believe there should be a spill motion or that Abbott should be replaced. The comments he made when tired at 6am were \u201cin no way designed to kick any story along\u201d. \u201cObviously I can\u2019t know what is in the minds of my colleagues,\u201d Pyne told Sky News. \u201cI was simply pointing out the obvious: I can\u2019t pretend to have extrasensory perception, but I don\u2019t want there to be a leadership change and I don\u2019t think the Australian public does.\u201d On Friday the Liberal MP Sharman Stone became the latest backbencher to publicly call for the leadership issue to be resolved next week, saying the speculation should not be allowed to \u201cdrag on and dribble on\u201d. Stone said a change of leadership, or a vote to keep Abbott, would allow the party to \u201cget back to the business of governing this country\u201d. There is still no declared alternative contender for the leadership. The communications minister and former Liberal leader, Malcolm Turnbull, said Abbott had \u201chad utter loyalty and consistency from his frontbench\u201d. \u201cThere is no tension between Tony and any of his senior colleagues; we are a very, very cohesive team and we are all supporting him,\u201d Turnbull told a community forum on Thursday evening. \u201cHe is not being undermined by anyone, any of his senior colleagues whatsoever. It\u2019s a very very united team.\u201d Abbott played down expectations of a spill motion next week, saying the government had had \u201ca rough trot\u201d but needed to \u201cend the navel gazing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting it,\u201d the prime minister told 2GB on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m expecting business as usual because this is a government with a very full agenda. Our immediate agenda is a much better families package focused on childcare, it\u2019s a tax cut for small business \u2026 so I\u2019m expecting just to get on with business and I\u2019m confident I have the full support of the cabinet.\u201d Abbott said he did not know who the so-called dissidents were, but he encouraged them to speak to him directly about the concerns. The prime minister cited the scrapping of the carbon and mining taxes and the negotiation of three free trade agreements as examples of his achievements, but said he was \u201cfocused on the future\u201d, including budget repair. \u201cI am spending every ounce of energy, I am dedicating every fibre of my being to try to ensure that this country flourishes,\u201d Abbott said. In a TV interview on Thursday evening, Abbott said he trusted assurances from Turnbull and the deputy leader, Julie Bishop, that they were not campaigning for the top job. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d Abbott told Sky News. Internally, Abbott\u2019s supporters are no longer arguing that he will win the next election but that he needs to be given more time to try to turn around the government\u2019s fortunes. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, said on Thursday that Abbott had heard the message and warned detractors against moving an \u201camateur-hour\u201d spill motion next week. Stone, who represents Murray in Victoria and had a public dispute with the cabinet last year over support for SPC Ardmona, said the issue must be resolved promptly. \u201cIf Tony gets through this then, right, we\u2019ve got to get behind Tony,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf someone else does, right, that\u2019s our leader and we get behind that person and we diminish the prospect of having Labor back in because that would be totally catastrophic.\u201d Stone declined to say which alternative leader she would support and, when asked whether she would consider moving the spill motion herself, said: \u201cI think there\u2019ll be a lot of conversations over the weekend about this. \u201cMy key point is that we can\u2019t let this go on. It\u2019s destructive and we only have 18 months to the next election which is not long at all; we have only weeks to the New South Wales election. The people of Australia are sick to death of this introspection when there are very important, significant issues in constituencies like mine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
