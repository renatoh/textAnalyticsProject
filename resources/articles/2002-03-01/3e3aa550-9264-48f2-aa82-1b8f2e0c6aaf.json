Those of you who do venture outdoors once in a while would probably have a heart attack if your satellite phone went wrong. You've lost touch with the deeper knowledge of nature, but be mindful that - when your house is repossessed and your pension won't even buy you an almond croissant - if you can find shelter in the forest and know how to roast a hedgehog you will never be short of a home, hearth and meal. First off you'll need some kit. A 100-litre rucksack is the bare minimum for anywhere outside the M25, as you'll need to carry clothes, navigational equipment, utensils, medicine and a large video recorder for making the documentary. Don't worry about food or something to sleep under as these can be taken care of on the way by staking out some marshes. Wait till you see 500 geese feeding, then creep up on them and wring their necks. Start a fire by rubbing a piece of elder to create embers and then roast the goose at the equivalent of gas mark 6 for two hours. While this is cooking, pluck the remaining birds and stuff their feathers inside your trousers and shirt, having first tied off the legs and sleeves with lengths of cordage made from seaweed. You have now turned yourself into a duvet with a tog of 10.5. Before settling down for the night, check you are not planning to go to sleep on the edge of a precipice, in a lion's den, down a crevasse or on the hard shoulder. Keep your fire lit to ward off mosquitoes and other dangerous predators. If you know what you're doing you can easily construct a birch bark canoe in about half an hour, but as you don't you're going to have to think of other ways of crossing rivers. Your best option is to find a bridge; failing that look for where the water is shallowest. Prepare yourself for the cold water by taking a few cold showers before you leave home. If you have to swim across a deep expanse of cold water, a well-packed rucksack can be made into a pedalo. Food deprivation is no laughing matter as you soon get hungry and grumpy. If you run out of goose, try looking for lobsters. If all else fails, there's fungi, burdock and lichen. And there you have it. You're ready for anything. So get lost. And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested... Everything you're unlikely to need for a tough night out on Clapham Common."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
