Liverpool take a 3-0 advantage into the quarter-final second leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday \u2013 a scoreline that their manager admits surprised him \u2013 and have never been eliminated from Europe after recording a three-goal first-leg lead. Klopp\u2019s team did, however, blow a three-goal advantage at Sevilla in the group stage while City have scored at least three goals in 12 home games this season, and the Liverpool manager expects Pep Guardiola\u2019s side to start with the same intensity as in the derby against Manchester United on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t need to remind the players of a specific game,\u201d he said, referencing Sevilla. \u201cBut I saw the game of City v United at the weekend. It was one of the best first halves I ever saw. It was like a thunderstorm. Then, in the second half, they change the game. After the first [United] goal, one team gains rhythm, another team loses rhythm. \u201cWe can go through all scenarios \u2013 they score early, we score early, all that stuff \u2013 but it is not to plan like this. I can tell the boys \u2018Score early!\u2019 but I\u2019m not sure that really helps. We have to think about football \u2013 what we have to do, where we have to do it. This is half-time. It was the same at half-time in Anfield: the game is not over. We were in the lead, nothing else. Being in the lead is not winning. We are still in the lead but we didn\u2019t win so far. We need a little bit more from this game.\u201d The Liverpool manager insisted his plan \u201cis all about winning the game again\u201d and it would be a mistake to try to defend a 3-0 lead against City. Despite the clear advantage, and having denied the highest\u2011scoring team in the Premier League a single shot on target at Anfield, Klopp maintains there is no added pressure on his players. \u201cI always see it as two legs are one game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a 3-0 lead. That is better than I would have expected. If you would have told me 10 days ago that this was possible I would have said: \u2018Don\u2019t think so.\u2019 I am not putting pressure on ourselves. We are so close. Our situation is not the easiest situation in world football, we are not flying with a full squad, but we stick together and we want to go as far as possible.\u201d The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, is suspended for the second leg while the leading goalscorer Mohamed Salah missed the Merseyside derby on Saturday with a groin problem. But the Egypt international trained at Melwood on Monday and is expected to start at the Etihad Stadium. Klopp said: \u201cHe and Alberto Moreno trained with the athletic coach yesterday and afterwards both said: \u2018We will be fine.\u2019 We will have to see after the session.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
