In a special to coincide with the feminist ideas festival Broadside, the panel considered questions and topics such as whether violence was a warranted and preferred method of effecting change, whether the police should be abolished, and what \u201cpositive masculinity\u201d could look like. At times Monday night\u2019s show went to places Q&amp;A rarely goes. \u201cWe are trying to keep the language under control,\u201d the host, Fran Kelly, said at one point. \u201cIf you\u2019re offended by the profanity, maybe leave now.\u201d That freewheeling approach culminated in the Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy offering as her best feminist advice: \u201cBe more bisexual. Be less cisgendered in the way you move through the world. Fuck it all up and be free.\u201d The decision to book Elthawy had already been seized upon by the rightwing Spectator magazine to attack the ABC for \u201cjustifying violence\u201d. Monday night\u2019s episode is likely to spark a wider debate about that question in some media. Earlier, when Eltahawy wondered how many rapists should be killed until men stopped raping women, Kelly replied: \u201cThem\u2019s fighting words.\u201d \u201cSpectator Australia is saying Mona is promoting violence,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying that violence has been owned by the state,\u201d Eltahawy said. \u201cThat violence has been given by the state to its police, that violence has been allowed to continue unchecked mostly by men, especially privileged men. Exactly how long do I have to wait to be safe?\u201d The discussion came amid a renewed global tide of political protest, with dramatic scenes and some violence from activists and authorities in countries inculding Hong Kong, Chile and Lebanon. The First Nations screenwriter Nayuka Gorrie told the show there was a case for violence from the perspective of the oppressed, saying Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experienced it from \u201cso many different places\u201d. \u201cWhen you say violence begets violence, it\u2019s almost sounding like it\u2019s a level playing field which it\u2019s not,\u201d Gorrie said. \u201cI wonder what our kind of tipping point in Australia\u2019s going to be when people will start burning stuff? I look forward to it.\u201d Gorrie said First Nations Australians had \u201ctried for 230-plus years to appeal to the colonisers\u2019 sense of morality, which doesn\u2019t seem to exist\u201d. \u201cI think violence is OK because if someone is trying to kill you, there\u2019s no amount of \u2018but I\u2019m really clever. I\u2019m really articulate \u2026 \u2019 \u2013 no amount of that will save you. Let\u2019s burn stuff,\u201d Gorrie said.\u2019\u2019 Elthawy and Gorrie had been responding to question from an audience member, Murray, who was worried that \u201cviolence begets violence\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smashing and destroying but what\u2019s the alternative?\u201d Murray said. The panel, who also included the journalist Jess Hill, the US anti-ageism campaigner Ashton Applewhite and the businesswoman Hana Assafiri, was also asked to consider comments from Barack Obama challenging \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201ccall out\u201d or \u201ccancel\u201d culture. \u201cI get a sense among certain young people on social media that the way of making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people,\u201d Obama said last week. Hill said there was \u201crampant awfulness\u201d on social media but she believed the cultural shift that has led to more scrutiny of people\u2019s views and opinions online said it had helped her as a writer. \u201cWhen I was writing a book about domestic abuse, I had their voices in my head and their scrutiny on my shoulder and it made me write a better book because someone can call me out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I write something that isn\u2019t nuanced enough or betray the principles or whatever I do, someone will call me out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
