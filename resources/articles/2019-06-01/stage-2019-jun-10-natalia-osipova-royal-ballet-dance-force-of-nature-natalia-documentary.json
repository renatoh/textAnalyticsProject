Why is she spending her time on this?\u2019\u201d Osipova sighs. \u201cI felt quite vulnerable. Why am I not understood?\u201d Some of her fans might not be ready to accompany the Russian ballerina on her odyssey into experimental dance, but Osipova is an artist who trusts her instincts: from her 2001 decision to walk out of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious ballet companies, the Bolshoi, in favour of a second-tier institution, the Mikhailovsky Theatre, to launching a parallel career in contemporary dance while still one of the top classical ballerinas. Now a principal with the Royal Ballet, and boasting a nonstop freelance schedule on the side, Osipova is a powerful dancer of explosive jumps and dramatic intensity. Her passion and self-belief give the title to Force of Nature Natalia, a new documentary by director Gerry Fox that follows Osipova as she rehearses for three shows: La Bayad\u00e8re at the Royal Ballet; The Mother, Arthur Pita\u2019s dark retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen story; and a new duet created with dancer and Osipova\u2019s fiance Jason Kittelberger, more of whom later. We meet at her flat in Little Venice, London \u2013 smart modern decor and the feel of someone who\u2019s not home much \u2013 where we are joined by an interpreter and two over-excited dogs. Osipova, 33, is very straightforward, not starry or effusive \u2013 unlike when she gets on stage, when she\u2019ll propel herself towards dramatic extremes. The Mother, a two-hander based on the bleak tale of a woman desperately trying to save her dying baby, often leaves Osipova bloodied and bruised from its physical floorwork and emotionally tested trying to reach the heart of the character. \u201cI\u2019m not a mother myself yet,\u201d she says, \u201cso I was anxious that it wouldn\u2019t be a realistic portrayal because I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d It\u2019s similar to how you feel about your dogs, I tell her, but times a hundred. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you make that comparison,\u201d she laughs, \u201cbecause when we got them, they were just puppies, two months old. And in a way, my feeling about them fed into the part.\u201d We talk about how rare it is in dance to depict something other than romantic love. \u201cTraditionally in ballet,\u201d she says, \u201cyou are expressing love for a man and there are very few exceptions. In my career, I can only think of Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s Anastasia.\u201d (Premiered in 1967, Anastasia is about a woman who claimed to be the daughter of tsar Nicholas II.) \u201cIn contemporary,\u201d Osipova adds, \u201cit\u2019s different. Sometimes we speak just about physiology, sexuality \u2026\u201d She pauses and laughs. \u201cBut the men are always there somewhere!\u201d Of course, two people, two bodies connecting, is something dance can express well. But Osipova is as interested in showing the realities of relationships as well as the fairytale ideals. Last year, in her self-curated programme Pure Dance, she and Kittelberger performed Roy Assaf\u2019s Six Years Later, a portrait of a tired and tetchy relationship, in which, the noted New York Times critic Siobhan Burke, Kittelberger emerged as an equal to the charismatic Osipova on stage. Dancing with Kittelberger was a revelation for Osipova. \u201cIt was so, so different to dancing with a classical dancer,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like a real person, really touching me, and it was like, \u2018Mmmm!\u2019\u201d Her bright eyes widen with mischief at the memory. \u201cIt was electrifying. He really showed me a different way of experiencing dance.\u201d Gerry Fox, who filmed the couple dancing in the studio, talks about their \u201csensual tension, two people giving their all through their bodies and being so free with each other\u201d. Osipova has danced with many notable partners, including former boyfriends Ivan Vasiliev and Sergei Polunin, but this was different. \u201cSo different,\u201d she says. The film sees them working on a new creation, I\u2019m Fine, about the ups and downs of a relationship. \u201cThe title comes from me personally, when I\u2019m irritated or angry \u2013 saying \u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 when it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not.\u201d Kittelberger created the steps (\u201cThat\u2019s not my strong point\u201d) and Osipova was dramaturg. \u201cI\u2019m more sensitive to the story,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m strong on interpretation. That\u2019s the gift I have.\u201d Kittelberger provides Osipova with essential support off stage as well as on. \u201cIf I\u2019m in an intense project, I become more needy,\u201d she says. \u201cI need more comfort, and if I don\u2019t get it I become resentful. I need a lot of attention, especially from men \u2013 maybe because my father had such a comforting, amazing energy. Jason really gets it and gives me everything I need. \u201cHe does see a bit of the child in me, in a good way. I\u2019m very aware of my own power. Physically and emotionally, I\u2019m a really strong person, in art and in life. But there are times when you want to totally give it away and be helpless, and he\u2019s somebody who can allow me to do that.\u201d As well as exploring her adventures in contemporary dance, Fox\u2019s documentary discusses one of Osipova\u2019s most feted classical roles: Giselle, the beautiful young peasant girl who falls for a deceitful nobleman. \u201cGiselle,\u201d Osipova tells the camera at one point, \u201cit\u2019s me.\u201d What did she mean? \u201cIt\u2019s the most natural part for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second act is so close to me, as if I have it somewhere in my DNA.\u201d Osipova is not the ghostly spirit of a wronged woman, as Giselle becomes in act two, but her entire physicality alters as she embodies the role \u2013 a more vivid, chilling and unhuman Giselle than any I\u2019ve seen. \u201cWhen I started dancing it, I was 19 or 20, and I was doing it in a very non-traditional way. My teachers would be telling me off, but I had such an inner certainty that it was impossible to knock it out of me.\u201d Where does that confidence come from? \u201cFrom my deep connection to the part \u2013 and my peaceful certainty that this is how it should be.\u201d When Osipova began her career at the Bolshoi, the director was Alexei Ratmansky, \u201cwho gave quite a lot of freedom\u201d. But when he was succeeded by Sergei Filin, Osipova found herself unhappy in Moscow, her opportunities restricted. She\u2019s content now at the Royal Ballet, a company with a healthier culture than most she has experienced. \u201cThe first time I came I was surprised there was no intrigue or conflict, and people were nice to each other,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my fifth season now and I\u2019ve had not a single conflict. Sometimes people say I just don\u2019t get enough of the language to know!\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut in other companies, you can sense it, when people are envious, or don\u2019t want you to be there, or they\u2019re talking behind your back. I can\u2019t work like that.\u201d Does something about the nature of ballet companies engender a dysfunctional atmosphere? Filin was the victim of an acid attack orchestrated by a disgruntled dancer, and New York City Ballet has been rocked by accusations of harassment and abuse. \u201cIt all depends on who is leading, and what they encourage and what they cut off,\u201d says Osipova. \u201cI can think of two situations when [Royal Ballet director] Kevin O\u2019Hare said, \u2018This is not happening\u2019, otherwise something unpleasant might have started.\u201d The pressure, the egos, the intensity of a dancer\u2019s life have certainly been blamed for more than one artistic outburst. Osipova\u2019s ex, Polunin, is a case in point, with his recent macho and fat-shaming tirades online. The controversial dancer had this to say about male dancers: \u201cFemales now trying to take on the man role because you don\u2019t f\u2013\u2013\u2013 them and because you are an embarrassment.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cLet\u2019s slap fat people.\u201d Osipova has gone on record saying Polunin is a good guy who should be judged only on his dancing. Why does she think he is so frequently self-destructive? \u201cNo one but him can answer your question,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly gifted, and I really wish that he nurtures it rather than undermines it.\u201d Osipova seems able to harness all the drama and drive for her dancing and thinks she has another five years of performing at her peak. \u201cAt the moment, I feel very mature and capable, emotionally and physically,\u201d she says. \u201cContemporary dance is making my body feel and move differently. It\u2019s a really good time for me now.\u201d \u2022 The Mother is at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 20-22 June. Force of Nature Natalia is out now and will be broadcast on Sky Arts on 18 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
