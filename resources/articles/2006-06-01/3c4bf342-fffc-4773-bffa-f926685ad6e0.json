I wouldn't be the person I am without it. It teaches you concrete, tangible skills. I still volunteer, even if now I do it in the UK rather than South Africa. It's exciting being back: after being in South Africa for so long, we came back here and started doing things we'd never done together, like go to restaurants. We met in December 2003, in the former homeland of Venda in the Limpopo province. I was volunteering, he was doing fieldwork for his PhD. I'd been there three months and suddenly there was all this excitement about his arrival. He'd been coming to Venda regularly since 1994 - he played in a reggae band, so people knew who he was. I was in Venda specifically because of a volunteer progamme he had set up. The day he turned up in the office, I was making preparations for World Aids Day. Fraser When I first took her out, I borrowed an orange Mercedes from a seriously rightwing Afrikaner and we cruised through town listening to reggae. She hadn't had a drink for four months, so I soon solved that. We went to a pub with a crocodile in the garden; the crocodile's not there any more. I liked that she got into a heated debate with the Merc-owner later that evening. I thought she was a bit posh at first, and here she was with a west of Scotland lout. We work well together. Aids is a mysterious illness out there. No one wants to speak about anything that relates to death. When they're dying, people hide in a hut or a hospital. It isn't in your face every day, but its presence is felt: when I first went in 1995, I played on a football team - only four or five of the team are still alive. The nice thing is, we both have memories of Venda. We know what it's like to have been there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
