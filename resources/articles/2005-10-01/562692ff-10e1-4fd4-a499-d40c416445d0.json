The face of The Daily Politics and This Week has been approached by Dominic Crossley-Holland, ITV's head of current affairs, to anchor Meet The Press, ITV's new 'relaxed and informal' Sunday morning political show which launches in February. It is billed as a 'more edgy, more campaigning, zeitgeisty' alternative to the traditional Sunday grilling of a political heavyweight by the likes of Andrew Marr, and Dimbleby himself, whose long-running ITV show ends in December. Friends say Neil is unsure whether swapping six shows a week at the Beeb for one on ITV would further his long and varied career. However, the BBC is undecided about whether to extend the no-nonsense Scot's contract, which expires in December. 'Helen Boaden, Director of BBC News, and Sue Inglish, head of political programmes, feel Andrew's other interests - running the Spectator and the Business for the Barclay Brothers - may be a problem,' said a BBC insider. Others believe Neil's journalistic rigour means the BBC would be mad to lose him. Especially as he could use his newspaper columns to start attacking his ex-employer. \u00b7 There can be fewer harder jobs in PR: selling American foreign policy to the Muslim world. But this doesn't daunt Karen Hughes, George Dubya's mumsy public-relations guru. Alas, so far, things have not gone well. On her first trip to the Middle East last week, Pendennis learns Hughes was lambasted by Turkish feminists, outraged at the American invasion of Iraq. With a smile stuck rigidly to her face, Hughes gamely tried to offer a defence, only to come up with this rather gung ho observation: 'To preserve the peace, sometimes my country believes war is necessary.' It was left to the Qatar daily newspaper, Asharq, to sum-up Hughes's contribution to detente. 'The Arab world is tired of US hurricanes. It hopes that hurricane Hughes will be the last one.' \u00b7 Former Python Michael Palin is to publish the diaries he has been keeping almost daily for the past 35 years. They will be edited by Ion Trewin, the man responsible for overseeing the corruscating private memoirs of Alan Clark and are expected to net Palin a six-figure sum. The first book will deal with Palin's life before and during the Python years; the second volume will focus on the 1980s, when Palin filmed The Life of Brian, and the third will concentrate on the 1990s, when he became a travel presenter. Expect the words 'Norwegian blue' to feature extensively. \u00b7 Pity poor Tessa Jowell who, at the Labour party conference, was doorstepped by a Scandinavian reporter convinced she was actually Estelle Morris. La Jowell did her best to put the confused hack right but to no avail. She could be heard desperately hollering: 'Estelle is somebody else. I'm Tessa Jowell. I'm Tessa!' Perhaps if Tony gave Tessa a bigger department to run, as she has been demanding for several years, this sort of mistake wouldn't arise. \u00b7 Chef Heston Blumenthal has become a global phenomenon thanks to his singular signature dishes, and it seems his most famous dish will endure for decades to come. Records at Companies House show Blumenthal has named his new company Snail Porridge, a homage to the dish that has made his fortune. \u00b7 It's the question that was left unanswered at the Labour conference. When is the Prime Minister going to quit? No, not quit as PM, but quit using whatever hair dye products he has been favouring. Observers of the PM's follicles suggest he has entered 'elder statesman' mode, dispensing with that chestnut hue, in what will now become a carefully stage-managed transformation to dignified grey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
