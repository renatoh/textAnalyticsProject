Jamie has it easy. Everything I know about making scrambled eggs is wrong. Disappointingly, it's not \"fucking wrong\" as Ramsay seems to have left his potty-mouth at home - or on the flight from New York from where he has hotfooted it to stand by the hotplate with me. He is undertaking this herculean task in the run-up to his new Channel 4 series of Cookalongs, in which he will cook seven meals on seven consecutive Fridays, from this week. When making scrambled eggs, you do not whisk the eggs in a bowl. You crack them into the pan - ideally with one hand, with a flick of the wrist and in a flurry of fingers. You do not add milk (or indeed bits of shell). Instead, add cr\u00e8me fraiche and butter; the fat slows down the cooking. And you spoon from pan to plate when the eggs are creamy like molten sunshine. Not when they're hitting gritty, as mine are. \"Overcooked,\" says Ramsay sniffily. I am not surprised. I do not have a natural aptitude for cooking. All those tricky timings, bubbling pots and hot ovens: it's too traumatic. I have been found, more than once, weeping softly over mushy-almost-to-the-point-of-liquefied broccoli. Of course, my aversion to culinary adventures makes me an ideal candidate to cookalong with Gordon. For all the cookery shows on TV, people are still reluctant to cook for themselves. \"I think they are part-frightened, part-lazy because of the convenience stores,\" says Ramsay. \"But I'd like to make two or three nights a week when it's about home cooking.\" Each week he will enlist not just the nation to cook along, but also a different celebrity. He mentions James Corden as a possibility and there's a rumour that his pal Victoria Beckham may appear. Ramsay recently dined at the Beckhams where a gazpacho of yellow heirloom tomatoes was followed by halibut. Whether she ate it or not, he doesn't say. \u2022 Join Allegra McEvedy on the food blog at 8pm on Wednesday October 22 for our first ever Word of Mouth live cookery class"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
