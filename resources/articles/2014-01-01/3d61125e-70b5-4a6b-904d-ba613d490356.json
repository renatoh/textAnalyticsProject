The answer is an unassuming but intensely observant 38-year-old named Matt Parker, who may yet prove as central to England's bid for success at next year's Rugby World Cup as Chris Robshaw and his players. In cycling Parker's name will always be synonymous with the cascade of gold Olympic medals at the 2012 London Games. As head of \"marginal gains\" at British Cycling he was responsible, among other things, for the heated pants which prevented riders' legs from cooling down between their warm-up and their races. Diet, performance analysis and aerodynamics also came under his rigorous gaze. The cherries? In common with fish oil, they contain large amounts of anti-oxidants which help with muscle recovery. Every little thing helps when you are trying to conquer the world. These days, as the Rugby Football Union's head of athletic performance, Parker's job is to give English rugby the inside track on how to maximise their talent to similar effect. The most obvious example since he started work just over a year ago can be seen peeking over the top of the rhododendrons on the left-hand side of the reassuringly long drive up to Pennyhill Park, the plush hotel in Bagshot where England train. At present it is just another wet, muddy work in progress but, weather permitting, England will take delivery this summer of their own bespoke indoor training facility after years of flitting between local clubs, schools and military establishments. Interestingly the building will not contain a full-size artificial pitch because Parker does not think one is absolutely necessary for England's specific needs. He believes a less cavernous 40mx40m dedicated training area will suffice; increasingly, what he says goes. Similarly, there will be none of the cryotherapy chambers which Wales swear by to accelerate players' recovery. Parker is too diplomatic to slag off other people's methods but clearly feels there are better options available. A physiology graduate, he joined the Institute of Sport in Manchester as long ago as 2001 and has forgotten more about elite preparation than most rugby people will ever know. \"It's very easy to fill your training with junk,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"High-performance sport is relentless. We've pretty much got every day until 2015 mapped out.\" Rugby is not supposed to be an exact science but it is increasingly heading that way. Parker, the Staffordshire-born son of RAF parents who had a peripatetic childhood in Machrihanish, Tewkesbury, East Grinstead and Troon before attending university in Glasgow, is also the type who is never entirely satisfied. Hence the occasionally left-field initiatives which helped turn British cycling into the envy of the world. During his time at Team Sky, the riders not only had their own hypoallergenic mattresses and duvets during races but some of the pillows even contained built-in iPod speakers to allow individuals to listen without disturbing their room-mate. Crucially, too, he is bright enough to realise that what worked splendidly in cycling is not automatically transferable. Wiggins may have won the Tour de France but the only pack he had to scrummage against in Paris were all carrying microphones and notebooks. Instead, Parker brings a fresh eye to a sport which remains stubbornly old-school in places. Not having played rugby since his own schooldays, his main expertise lies in making sure everyone connected with England thinks straight and pulls together as one. A former colleague at UK Sport, the former England lock Nigel Redman, once described him as \"brilliant at cutting through the bullshit\". \"Matt's greatest strength was keeping things simple,\" confirmed Rod Ellingworth, now Team Sky's performance manager. \"He is a thinker ... he will take a problem away and find a solution.\" Instilling a sense of clear direction and a desire to pursue excellence is clearly the first prerequisite for wannabe world-class teams. In that respect Parker sees similarities between Stuart Lancaster and his former boss Sir Dave Brailsford. \"Stuart has a very clear sense of direction, he knows what he wants.\" The next stage is to get \"from good to great\". Parker cannot turn average players into world-beaters or coach them better than Andy Farrell or Graham Rowntree but he can help with the final 10% which separates champions from mere podium finishers. Fitness, attitude, planning and motivation will all be key. Already the changing rooms at Twickenham have been revamped; when the players trot out they can even read messages from loved ones and supporters on the tunnel walls. So what exactly is he up to on the eve of the Six Nations? It is a bit like inviting Apple to tell their competitors what the next breed of iPad will look like. Suffice to say Parker and his team have not been idle. Within 10 minutes of Twickenham is a research laboratory owned by GlaxoSmithKline, now an official partner of the RFU. As well as supplying supplements and energy drinks, tests have already been conducted into how individual England players sweat. This, in turn, will influence kit design and optimise hydration and recovery. The really deep secret-squirrel stuff remains under wraps but, for Parker, doing what everyone else did a year ago is unthinkable. \"I've no preconceptions about the right way of doing something. Change is inevitable. You have to have change within organisations to keep them moving forwards.\" Closer to the World Cup that is set to involve training at night, in recognition of the fact all England's pool games will kick off at 8pm. Parker has already been down to New Zealand for a recce ahead of this summer's three-Test series against the All Blacks; every detail of the squad's preparation between now and then will be scrutinised intently. Will it all pay off? Test rugby is increasingly about tiny margins and England now boast an expert in that particular field. \"We've won a lot of games but it's time to step up again and starting winning championships,\" stressed Parker this week. If anyone can help them make that final leap, it is him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
