Like it says. High definition - only Ultra in a brilliant whitening toothpaste kinda way. What else? Sixteen times better resolution than your bog-standard high def, itself five times the quality of its poor cousin, today's terrestrial TV. Normal HD has a maximum resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, but Ultra stretches that to an eye-popping 7680x4320. Go on. The men in white coats at NHK, the Japanese equivalent of the BBC, have been working on an improved version of HD for a while - remember NHK sort of invented high definition, filming the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles in what was then known as Hi-Vision. Aside from a picture so detailed it will scare you are benefits such as 22-channel sound - so instead of the five or six speakers on a surround sound set-up you will have four times as more. Why would I want it? If you are one of the thousands of people waiting patiently for Sky's new HD box to finds its way to your home, then you probably won't need prompting when a super-duper new version comes along. For anyone else, you will just get a quantum jump in detail and the sort of immersive sound that will make your hairs stand on end. At NHK's recent demo of Ultra HD you could see the treads in the tyres of New York taxis. What's the downside? With an estimated 20-year development time, do not hold out on buying a new TV just yet. There are only two Ultra HD cameras in the world and each weighs about 45kg. It currently takes hours to format even short video sequences and the amount of storage required to hold such a volume of data does not bear thinking about. The 400in prototype TV - more drive-in cinema than home movie theatre - burns as much electricity as a typical household might use in a month. Cramming those 22 speakers into your pod-like urban living space might leave you room for a bonsai tree, but little else. When can I get one? 2030 might be a reasonable estimate given that it took 20 years for non-Ultra HD to escape from the lab and into our living rooms.
