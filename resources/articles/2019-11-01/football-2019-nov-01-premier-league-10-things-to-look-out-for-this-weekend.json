The international break came at a good time for United, but not just for the usual reasons. Marcus Rashford\u2019s performances before he went away with England were abysmal; he looked unhappy, demotivated and in desperate need of a rest. It turned out all he needed was a change. Rashford always seems happy playing for England, and his storming goal to open the scoring in Bulgaria has apparently given him a huge injection of confidence and zeal. He has sparked United\u2019s mini-revival with a number of moments of coruscating brilliance. A tactical change and the return of his on-field kindred spirit Anthony Martial have also helped, with Rashford now playing wide left or as a split striker rather than an isolated No 9. Rashford is an injury doubt for the trip to Bournemouth, and will surely be missed if unavailable. He is still a long way from the finished article, like most 22-year-olds, but he is the most likely of the current squad to become what all emerging teams need: a talisman. RS \u2022 Bournemouth v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT) 2) Villa unrecognisable from 2016 rout by Reds Liverpool\u2019s last league visit to Villa Park, three and half a years ago, ended in a 6-0 spanking for the hosts. Afterwards a delighted J\u00fcrgen Klopp said his team\u2019s performance was \u201cgood for the soul\u201d, which was an apt turn of phrase not least because Villa, back then, were a club whose soul seemed to have been hollowed out. Now, though, they have it back. Dean Smith has a vibrant team who are growing stronger by the week. Do not be fooled by last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, where Villa were better than the scoreline suggests. Liverpool face a serious test, especially if Jack Grealish recovers from a calf injury in time to play, and Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s knee trouble rules him out again. PD Aston Villa v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm 3) \u00d6zil\u2019s class can still help Emery out of a hole If Mesut \u00d6zil doesn\u2019t return to Arsenal\u2019s Premier League team against Wolves on Saturday, he probably never will. His performance at Anfield on Wednesday was a timely reminder that, for all the frustrations, few players in the world have his ability to strip a defence naked with such insouciant \u00e9lan. His improvised backflick to create Ainsley Maitland-Niles\u2019s goal at Anfield was the latest in a rich portfolio of unique creative genius. The fact he has played only 71 minutes of Premier League football this season is almost an act of cultural vandalism. At his best, there is no one in the world with \u00d6zil\u2019s cold-blooded serenity, technique and imagination in the final third. And while he has generally been nowhere near his best under Unai Emery, his performance against Liverpool could serve as an olive branch. Who knows: in one final twist, a returning Ozil could even save Emery\u2019s job. RS \u2022 Arsenal v Wolves, Saturday 3pm 4) Everton and Spurs sense chances to lift the gloom Excluding lower-league opposition in the Carabao Cup, so far this season Everton have beaten Watford, Wolves, West Ham and Watford again. The bad news is that they are not going to play another side beginning with W until mid-January, but Marco Silva hopes victory over the Hornets in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday will mean \u201cthe mood and confidence will be different\u201d when Tottenham visit on Sunday. The performance in that match, and particularly in a dreadful first half, was, however, not so overwhelming that Spurs won\u2019t be looking at this game as an opportunity to improve their own mood and confidence. News just in from the mildly curious historical anomaly department: though overall Everton have won 31% of their games against Tottenham, drawing 31% and losing 38%, in the month of November they have lost 44%, drawn 44% and won just 12% (two out of 16, and only once in 11 games since 1961). SB \u2022 Everton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm 5) Don\u2019t expect fireworks from toothless Watford Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has wrought a complete tactical transformation at Watford: from four at the back to five; from a team that could hardly defend to one that have conceded only one \u2013 handball-assisted \u2013 goal in their last three league games; from one that might occasionally score to one that hardly even tries. Troy Deeney\u2019s injury hasn\u2019t helped; Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s arrival in January \u2013 the 18-year-old Brazilian received a work permit this week \u2013 might eventually. In the meantime Roberto Pereyra and Gerard Deulofeu are much happier outside the penalty area and tend to stay there, leaving Watford blunted. It\u2019s just as well Watford Borough Council\u2019s big festive display has been put back half an hour to allow fans to make it after the game, because unless Flores has been working on another transformation they\u2019re unlikely to have any fireworks to enjoy at Vicarage Road. SB \u2022 Watford v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm 6) Saints to settle for a respectable thrashing at City? There are times when the fixture list is downright sadistic. Just ask Southampton, who have had to follow their 9-0 defeat at home to Leicester with two trips to the Etihad Stadium. They got off pretty lightly with a 3-1 defeat in the Carabao Cup, when City rested key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl may endure a long night of the soul as he considers what a full-strength team could do to his side. City, after all, have already scored 49 goals this season. There have been thousands of football matches involving teams who would both secretly settle for a draw beforehand. This might be the first, certainly in Premier League history, in which both sides would accept a 4-0 home win. RS \u2022 Manchester City v Southampton, Saturday 3pm 7) Blades sharpened by firm defensive foundations No side has conceded fewer goals than Sheffield United in the Premier League. They have let in eight, the same number as Leicester and Manchester City, and another clean sheet at home to Burnley would give them a counter-puncher\u2019s chance of a victory that could take them as high as fifth in the table. United\u2019s defensive record compares especially well to their fellow promoted sides: they have conceded half as many as Aston Villa (16), and a third as many as Norwich (24). The back three of Chris Basham, John Egan and Jack O\u2019Connell, the kind of EFL stalwarts who are supposed to get vertigo in the Premier League, have all been outstanding this season. The club broke their transfer record four times in the summer, all on attacking players. But it is the old defence that is pushing them to unexpected heights. RS \u2022 Sheffield United v Burnley, 3pm Saturday 8) Odds are against Carroll to thrive on return to West Ham Andy Carroll returned to training this week after a slight groin strain, and looks set to return to West Ham for the first time since leaving on a free transfer this summer. \u201cI hope he will be fit,\u201d the West Ham manager, Manuel Pellegrini, said, charitably. \u201cHe, like Winston Reid, is a player who has had many injuries, long injuries, and they deserve to have a normal career.\u201d It is probably already too late for that: a few months from his 31st birthday, and with this game being played 13 years to the day since he made his senior debut, the famously injury-prone Carroll has started precisely 100 fewer club matches than Crystal Palace\u2019s 26-year-old Wilfried Zaha. If he continued to start as frequently as he has across his career so far, he would catch up with Mark Noble\u2019s current number of career starts sometime in October 2036. Football of course has its immutable law of the ex, which states that a player will always over-perform against his former teams, but Carroll appears to be an exception here as well: having played six times for West Ham against Newcastle without scoring (and another three barren games against them for Liverpool), it would be somewhat galling if he were to score against the Hammers at his first attempt. SB \u2022 West Ham v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm 9) Pukki and Maupay key to Amex outcome The two most prolific scorers in last season\u2019s Championship will have a big say in who wins Saturday\u2019s important Premier League encounter at the Amex. Teemu Pukki struck six times in his first five top-flight matches this season but has failed to find the net in his past five. Meanwhile Neal Maupay has thrived at Brighton even if his goal tally (four) is lower than Pukki\u2019s. The Frenchman, a \u00a320m summer signing from Brentford, is much more than a goal-getter and his intelligent movement and passing have been integral to the attacking style introduced at Brighton by Graham Potter. Maupay is as likely to score net this weekend as he is to create a goal for his striker partner, Aaron Connolly, who is far more Pukki-like in his play. Expect Brighton to prevail in an entertaining duel on the south coast. PD \u2022 Brighton v Norwich, Saturday 3pm 10) An unlikely top-six set-to at Selhurst On the day Everton (16th) play Tottenham (11th), Selhurst Park hosts the most unlikely November top-six fixture for some time. Leicester\u2019s success this season was not entirely unexpected, but Palace\u2019s position is a genuine surprise \u2013 though it would be even more impressive should they still be there once their current testing run of fixtures (Manchester City, Arsenal, Leicester, Chelsea, Liverpool) comes to a conclusion later this month. Leicester fans are unlikely to relish a visit to a team that did the double over them in each of the past two seasons, even if not all of those defeats had entirely negative consequences. After all, it was Palace\u2019s 4-1 victory at the King Power Stadium in February that precipitated the sacking of Claude Puel the following day, and the transformational arrival of Brendan Rodgers soon afterwards. After that Palace game they had lost seven games out of nine; they have lost five of 21 since, winning 12.
