Unfortunately, the economies tend to end with the flight. Everything else about skiing means either taking a serious hit to the wallet or making pretty grim compromises with quality. At one end of the spectrum are operators providing luxury accommodation and gourmet food, but at the price of a medium-sized family car. At the other end, there are the companies that will cram 14 people into a garden shed, add a gap-year \"host\", and call it a chalet holiday. If you go down the DIY route, you may be able to shave a couple of hundred pounds off the all-in price, but with equipment hire, ski schools or day care for the kids, and restaurants, you have to face the truth that winter sports is never going to be a cheap holiday. And that's disappointing, because nothing quite touches it for that combination of sublime scenery and physical exhilaration: health and beauty in a can. One new outfit, Riders Republic, is helping to bridge the gap between cheap and not-so-cheerful, and luxurious but financially crippling. So far, it owns just one chalet in the Paradiski area of the French Alps, for which it charges a flat rate of \u00a3300pp a week, even during the school holidays. The chalet is in Montorlin, a charming and tiny hamlet just a 10-minute schlep down the mountain from Montchavin. Montchavin itself is a perfect alpine village, largely traffic free, and with an unspoilt, laid-back feel. It remains distinctly French, lacking that sense of Surrey-with-snow that you sometimes get in the more Brit-swamped resorts. It is at the heart of over 400km of piste, with La Plagne on one side and the mighty open runs of Les Arcs a cable-car ride away on the other. You could quite easily spend a week there and never go down the same run twice. That cable car - the Vanoise Express - is one of the wonders of the Alps, carrying up to 200 people at a time over a dizzying drop. Stand at the front window and prepare to gawp. You can buy a ski pass to cover La Plagne and Les Arcs, and if wild roving is your thing, then go ahead - zigzagging your way from Vallandry to Villaroger, with lunch in Arc 2000, will give you a day's skiing that you'll never forget. Or you may feel that La Plagne offers enough variety, and it will save you around \u20ac40 on the lift pass if you stick on that side. The Montorlin end of the Riders Republic operation is run by Paul and Jo. They've worked hard at giving the holiday that elusive feeling of staying with friends. Both are fervent snowboarders, and it's probably fair to say that the generally youthful, vibrant feel owes much to the boarding ethos. Having said that, the majority of us staying this week were skiers, and we never felt remotely out of place. The chalet is well equipped and comfortable. There are four good-sized rooms, and if you get the chance you should ask for the balcony room at the front, which although a touch noisy does have magnificent views across the valley. There is a split lounge and dining room, and a quiet area for reading or hiding from the kids. The layout works well for families with children, offering zones of relative seclusion for young and old. The chalet is modern, and therefore doesn't exactly have oodles of old Savoyard charm, and nor is this the kind of place where you come back to find a chocolate on your pillow. But there is a hot tub, lovingly stoked and tended by Paul, and once you've soaked away the pains and strains of a day on the slopes in its hot, fragrant waters, you'll wonder how you ever managed without one. Paul does most of the cooking, providing simple and satisfying dishes, well prepared and unfussily presented. Each evening meal turns into a dinner party, with Paul and Jo joining in or stepping back as the mood dictates. Jo also does noble work on the cakes that wait for you on your return from the slopes at tea-time. Paul runs you up to Montchavin in the morning and collects you in the afternoon. He also helps with the tiresome first-day chores of booking lessons and hiring equipment. The Riders Republic team includes an English nanny, on hand for the younger children, and Montchavin has a good kids' club, as well as a choice of ski schools - Evolution 2, with its smaller groups and reasonably fluent English-speaking instructors, probably gets the nod ahead of Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais. Sharing a chalet is always something of a lottery, with the ever-present possibility of having to listen to a buttock-faced merchant banker blare into his mobile, but the company during our week couldn't have been more varied or interesting.
