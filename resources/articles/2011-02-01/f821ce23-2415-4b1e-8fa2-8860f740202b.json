Rangers' manager-in-waiting welcomed the arrivals of El Hadji Diouf, Kyle Bartley and David Healy to Ibrox before the transfer window closed but witnessed the latest sign of what trouble lies ahead therein. Each of the trio has signed contracts until the end of the season in an example of the short-termism that has been forced upon Rangers by monetary constraints. Those who take an extended view legitimately ask just what McCoist will shortly inherit. \"I can't afford to think like that unfortunately,\" McCoist says of planning further ahead. \"In an ideal situation, it would be great to think like that but we can only think for the moment. The long-term future of the club is of paramount importance but the immediate future is to win games and that's the way it has got be. We are not doing our job if we don't have a wee eye on the future but our immediate task is winning games.\" McCoist was lined up to replace Walter Smith when the pair returned to the club in January 2007. Barring an unforeseen change of circumstances, that scenario will come to pass when Smith steps down this summer. Yet the scene McCoist will step into varies from four years ago and dramatically so from two decades ago, when he was plying a successful playing trade at Rangers. The club once known for spending lavish sums on players has been controlled by the Lloyds Banking Group since the start of last season. That is unlikely to change quickly. With each passing day, the likelihood of Craig Whyte, the would-be owner, stepping in to purchase David Murray's shares recedes. The spectre of an ongoing investigation by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs into offshore benefit trust scheme payments to players looms large over any takeover, if it does not halt such a thing entirely. An inability to separate Rangers from Murray's indebted business group is the more basic problem. There is something cruel about McCoist's role in all of this. Given his desire to be the Rangers manager and the adulation understandably afforded to him by the club's support, filling the post in such difficult circumstances seems unfair on the 48-year-old. Not so long ago, he earned more money and less pressure as a Question of Sport team captain. Any sympathy for Rangers' record goalscorer can be offset in part by suggestions a wage limit of \u00a314m will remain available; that dwarfs the funds available to any manager outside the Old Firm. Nonetheless, Rangers will not return to a prominent position on a wider, European platform until fresh investment is forthcoming. Admirably, McCoist claims he would accept missing out on his big chance if a new owner arrived and decided to appoint a more experienced manager. \"That's life,\" says McCoist, who is obviously as troubled by the status quo as those in the stands. \"I would far rather the club was bought because that would be for the benefit of the club. I am not trying to play the martyr but I am a Rangers supporter and the best thing that can happen to our club is to be bought over and for investment. It doesn't look at this moment as if it is going to happen. \"I fully appreciate the risks that go with the club being bought in terms of my future but if you are asking me if I had a choice, in terms of the welfare of the club, I would far rather it was bought and investment was made. Four months is a long time in football. Somebody could come in and buy the club and damn tooting they would be well within their rights to get someone they wanted in as the manager but the plan is for me to take over when Walter leaves. \"The manager and [chief executive] Martin Bain have been fantastic because they realise if I do take over then I am going to have a pretty reasonable understanding of what's going on. They have been great in keeping me involved in meetings. \"Martin and I have talked briefly and we will continue talking, we'll get something sorted which would be great but it's not something that is a burning issue. It would be crazy not to get that security but at the same time I have got trust in the people I am working with and dealing with.\" Tomorrow lunchtime, Celtic visit Ibrox for an eagerly awaited Scottish Cup tie. Pre-match chat has surrounded the \u00a31m each club will earn from the fixture almost as much as Neil Lennon's chances of guiding his team to a second win in succession at the home of Celtic's city rivals. It is with such fiscal discussion that McCoist has unwillingly become accustomed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
