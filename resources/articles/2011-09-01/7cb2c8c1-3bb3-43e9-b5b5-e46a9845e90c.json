Asked in an interview with the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley at the Liberal Democrat conference whether he would resign as climate change secretary if the police charged him, Huhne said: \"We'll have to wait and see, but I don't anticipate that as a likely outcome. I'm hopeful that the Crown Prosecution Service will reach the conclusion that there is not a case to answer.\" He said he hoped the police inquiries would \"draw a line under\" the affair. \"This is a matter which I hope we're going to see as a result of the Essex police investigation and the Crown Prosecution Service. I'm delighted to say that there's an official inquiry into all of this stuff and I hope that is going to draw a line under it.\" Asked if he was expecting a criminal trial, Huhne said: \"No. I am expecting that the results of the investigation will draw a line under the whole matter and that will be the end of it.\" Huhne was asked if he had ever asked his wife, Vicky Pryce, to pretend she was driving when he was speeding so she could take his points. \"I've very clearly denied this,\" he said. \"I continue to very strongly deny this.\" Asked if he would \"swear it\", Huhne replied: \"Absolutely. I've made that absolutely and abundantly clear and I'm intending to contest that and the Crown Prosecution Service and the Essex police know that.\" Had he ever asked anyone to pretend they were driving instead of him? \"No \u2026 I want them to draw a line under this whole affair and I'm confident that they will.\" Rawnsley also asked Huhne how often he had exceeded the speed limit. \"I have no idea,\" he said, \"but, I mean, too many times because I lost my licence on cumulative points and tot-up.\" Huhne was also asked about the affair that led to his separation from Pryce. Huhne left his wife of 27 years last year for Carina Trimingham, who ran his campaign to become leader of the Liberal Democrats, which he lost to Nick Clegg. When Rawnsley asked if he regretted hurting Pryce, he said: \"Yes, I do. I mean, frankly it was [an] appalling set of circumstances and in retrospect I can see that I was running some substantial risks, for example, in what I was doing politically as well.\" He implied the News of the World may have printed the story about his affair because he spoke out about phone hacking, and perhaps even that his phone had been hacked in the process. \"In the run-up to the election I was the first frontbencher to call for a judicial inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal, and of course the newspaper that put people on to me and broke the story about the affair was the News of the World. So we'll have to see in the great span of things what the conclusions are from all of that, but I personally feel enormously regretful about what I put my family through, about what happened with Vicky, and I entirely understand the stress that she has been caused by this. She's a very private person.\" Huhne said he had apologised to his wife but she had not accepted his apology. Did he think she ever would? \"I don't know,\" the climate secretary said, adding: \"I'm always hopeful that time heals but she is still very angry. I do understand that entirely.\" --"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
