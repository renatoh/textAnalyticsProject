More than two dozen leading publishers \u2013 including the Financial Times, Guardian, Le Monde, Spiegel, Telegraph, Daily Mail and Les Echoes \u2013 have signed a letter to the European parliament, which is deliberating proposals to tighten up how data is gathered and used by web companies. The publishers argue that new regulations relating to \u201ccookies\u201d \u2013 small files that remember users\u2019 digital habits therefore allowing the targeting of relevant ads \u2013 could cut off their ability to build digital revenue. Currently, when users visit an individual website or app they are asked if they will consent to a cookietracking them. Under the European commission\u2019s plans, consumers will in the future instead be asked to make a single choice to accept, or reject, cookies from all websites and apps only on one single occasion on their phone or browser. Publishers argue that creating a single \u201cswitch\u201d will most likely result in consumers taking the simplest route of opting out of all cookies, leaving them with scant information to support their targeted advertising models. In turn, this would leave the few digital giants used by most consumers to access the web, and those like Facebook that have their own giant data mining capability, in control. \u201cGiven that 90% of [digital] usage across Europe is concentrated in the hands of just four companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla, this [proposal]... has the potential to exacerbate the asymmetry of power between individual publishers and these global digital gateways,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe current ePrivacy proposals will result in the data of European digital citizens being concentrated in the hands of a few global companies, as a result of which digital citizens will become less protected. It will give those global companies a tighter grip on the personal data of European digital citizens.\u201d Under the proposals, publishers would be allowed to lobby consumers to go into their settings and unblock individual sites and \u201cwhite list\u201d them, but news organisations believe that in practice this would prove to be an extremely difficult task. The proposal has been compared to the ad-blocking battle in which publishers ask the increasing number of those who use the software to turn it off, or add their businesses to a white list, explaining how advertising is essential income for many digital news businesses. The proposals are likely to further exacerbate the huge issue publishers already face as Google and Facebook sweep up as much as 90% of all new digital display advertising. \u201cThe practice of serving relevant advertising to readers is now an established norm in the advertising industry, and is essential to ensure that publishers can compete with Google and Facebook who already control 20% of total global advertising spend,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIf as a result of these proposals news publishers were unable to serve relevant advertising to our readers, this would reduce our ability to compete with the capabilities of dominant digital platforms for digital advertising revenues, ultimately undermining our ability to invest in high quality journalism across Europe,\u201d the letter says. In recent months, Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook have faced a barrage of criticism for allowing ads to run next to inappropriate content such as extremist videos. The companies have also faced a number of issues that have hurt their previously unquestioned ability to accurately target ads, such as brands being charged for ads viewed by \u201cbots\u201d, computer programmes mimicking an internet user, and Facebook admitting to a number of measurement errors. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s ePrivacy proposals will make it more difficult to ensure transparency ... and remove any distinction between publishers who place a high value on trust of their users, and those who do not,\u201d the publishers\u2019 letter says. However, the bad press has so far failed to dent their popularity with advertisers with Google and Facebook enjoying a near duopoly of control of the \u00a311bn UK digital advertising market. Publishers say that they support the overall objective of the draft \u201cePrivacy\u201d regulation, which they say has the \u201cpotential to clean up the digital economy\u201d, but they need to compete on a fair playing field. \u201cCitizens are rightly concerned about the use of their personal data by third-party companies of whom they have never heard, and have no idea about the role that they play in their digital lives online,\u201d the letter says. \u201c[But] the commission\u2019s proposals threaten to prevent news organisations from delivering basic functionality such as the marketing of products and services, the tailoring of news products to the needs and desires of news consumers, and relevant and acceptable advertising.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
