The first episode screened to celebrate the move from BBC2 to Channel 4 is A Tale of Two Springfields, in which the Simpsons' hometown is split between two phone-codes, creating rich and poor communities, with America's cartoon first family condemned to the latter. Homer is able to become mayor of the downtrodden populace but he knows that he has been defeated by the elite. The Simpsons famously works on several levels (political satire, art criticism, toddler slapstick) and this episode can be read as a metaphor for the viewers of British TV. The audience is divided into two districts: one which sees The Simpsons, The West Wing, The Sopranos and Little Britain first on Sky One, E4 or BBC3, the other forced to wait for the delayed showing on terrestrial television. Viewers in the first phone-code zone will find it hard to understand the fuss Channel 4 is making about the screening of A Tale of Two Springfields. But, while you can only change phone-codes by buying a new home, the movement between the two viewing communities is increasingly fluid and confused. The huge success, and attendant publicity, of Little Britain means that two million people are watching the new series on BBC3. This means that the subsequent BBC2 showing - planned as the primary transmission - will already feel like a repeat. With a hit, that may not matter - BBC3 viewers will happily tune in again - but this week's terrestrial premiere of the comedy The Smoking Room demonstrates the opposite problem. Poorly received on BBC3, it now reaches BBC2 having used up its publicity and critical goodwill, feeling rather like a theatrical flop in the provinces that is still forced to transfer to the West End. The increasing number of preview treats for new-technology viewers is a deliberate attempt to modernise the audience before analogue sets are switched off but the result is that, until the changeover, terrestrial television will tend to feel second-hand. The very low audience figures on Channel 4 for two prestigious American series previously seen on E4 - The Sopranos and The West Wing - suggest that staggered scheduling does effect terrestrial ratings (in the same way that international internet book-selling reduces the sales of American titles when they are eventually released in Britain). The Simpsons, though, is the programme best-placed to resist this trend because it is hard to think of another series that so encourages repeat viewings: because there are so many hidden gags and patterns (openly available versions of what the DVD trade calls \"Easter Eggs\"), that the first viewing tends to be a warm-up for more: familiarity breeds desire. The fact that viewers have previously seen A Tale of Two Springfields or Tree House of Horror XI on Sky One may actually encourage them to tune in again. But The Simpsons has always made its own rules - artistically and commercially - and has little relevance as a general example. The small audiences for other transfers suggest that television's two area codes - Digital Heights and Terrestrial Terrace - are increasingly separate communities and the Mayor Simpsons of the industry need to do something to make them speak to each other. A more optimistic omen for old-fashioned viewers this week is the screening by Channel 4 of the mountaineering movie Touching the Void only a year after it was a hit in cinemas. The newest James Bond movie also reached ITV1 last week, just two years later than its copyright date. Viewers over 30 will remember when it was normal to wait four or five years between a film's release and its appearance on television. The relative rush to show films on TV has resulted from co-productions (Channel 4 part-funded Touching the Void) and the speed with which films now reach DVD (a technology that has created another exclusive cultural area-code of people who see things later than moviegoers but before the TV audience). Gun-control legislation in America has brought in the concept of the \"waiting period\": a delay for background checks before a weapon is handed over. Terrestrial-only viewers watching The Simpsons on Friday will reflect that the waiting period for good TV is increasing, while many in the audience for Touching the Void will be glad that, for films, it's going down. The latest elimination talent show on television takes nine months to find a winner: an appropriate gestation period because they are looking for a Broadway Baby. Musicality - a hunt for an amateur worthy of a slot in a professional chorus line - is Channel 4's follow-up to Operatunity, which did the same for the heavier end of musical theatre. These are wannabe programmes for viewers who find The X Factor too vulgar. As in the West End and on Broadway, the fate of TV talent shows depends largely on the casting. Here, the judges run the traditional range from pussycat to cattiness: voice coach Mary and choreographer Stacy are sweet and supportive to those applying, while musical director Gareth delivers high-camp aphorisms. He describes one tight-bodied male wannabe as resembling \"a condom full of walnuts\" (an unattributed use of Clive James's description of the young Arnold Schwarzenegger) and, when a young man called Warren impresses, shivers: \"If that's the Warren, I want to be the rabbit.\" Perhaps surprisingly, given these contributions, Gareth's main objection to several competitors is that they are trying too hard. The other familiar pleasure is the deadpan commentary, the intonation unchanged by disaster - \"Stacy resorts to pony-steps to get everyone across the floor\" - or possible triumph: \"Next up is Alex, an ex-ministry of defence training officer who Gareth suspects may have that rarest of singing talents: the falsetto.\" Musicals - in which being plucked from the chorus line is common as both a subject and a career-move - may well be the most natural territory for talent-hunt telly, and the first edition of Musicality suggests that it has the legs, even if many of the hopefuls don't. \u00b7 The Simpsons, Friday, from 9pm, Channel 4; Touching The Void, Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4; Musicality, Channel 4, 9pm, Wednesday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
