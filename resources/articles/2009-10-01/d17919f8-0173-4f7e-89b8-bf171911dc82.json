His good fortune in inheriting David Seaman when he took over at Arsenal in September 1996 camouflaged the blind-spot for only so long. The manager cannot pick a goalkeeper. Jens Lehmann might argue to the contrary \u2013 it is one of the maverick German's specialities \u2013 but since Seaman departed in 2003, the goalkeeper position has been Wenger's biggest headache. It vexes him more than everat present. As Liverpool basked in the luxury of resting Pepe Reina, the outstanding Spaniard, Wenger handed Lukasz Fabianski his first appearance of the season, the Poland international having recovered from the knee ligament surgery that he underwent in August. It was a big moment for Fabianski as the feeling persists that not only is he Wenger's favourite senior goalkeeper just now \u2013 the 19-year-old Wojciech Szczesny could yet be the best of the lot but he remains raw \u2013 but that he has the chance to make the position his own and convince Wenger that he has no need to sign a replacement in the January transfer window. The club's scouts have begun the hunt for fresh blood. Arsenal are the only would-be title challengers for whom competition for the goalkeeping jersey is real. Can a club win the championship with such a situation? Some would argue that Arsenal are the only challengers who lack a world-class performer between the posts. How has it come to this, Wenger might wonder? The answer may lie somewhere between the ears of Manuel Almunia, who entered the season as Arsenal's undisputed No1 but has suffered a crisis of confidence so marked that meltdowns are being whispered about. Almunia last played on 12 September in the defeat at Manchester City and initially, for some weeks, it must be said, he was ruled out by a debilitating virus. But since his recovery he has been confined to the substitutes' bench. For three matches he stewed behind stony features. He was spared that torment here, as Szczesny was named among the substitutes, and Almunia continues to hope for a recall, now at home to Tottenham Hotspur in Saturday's north London derby. But the position is really is up for grabs. Vito Mannone, who began the season as the third-choice goalkeeper and who stepped in when Almunia fell ill, has been erratic. He excelled in the victory at Fulham but, like Almunia, he has suffered from jittery moments. A period out of the spotlight beckons for him. Wenger's faith in Fabianski is total and it was illustrated towards the end of last season after the 24-year-old had suffered a nightmare performance in the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Chelsea. Fabianski had been rounded by Didier Drogba for the winning goal after leaving his line recklessly, his most glaring of a clutch of errors. \"I firmly believe that Lukasz will be one of the greatest keepers in the world,\" Wenger said. \"He has talent, he's intelligent, he's brave and is very good technically. He was not at his best against Chelsea and you have to accept that can happen to anyone.\" Fabianski will ask himself whether he could have done anything to keep out Emiliano Insua's dipping and swerving 26th-minute blast. Wenger demands such self-analysis. He had been caught slightly too far forward and no goalkeeper likes to be beaten from long-range. His counterpart in the Liverpool goal, Diego Cavalieri, might ask himself similar questions about Fran Merida's opening goal, another pot-shot from distance, which beat him high at his near post. Fabianski, who showed some neat handling, also had a heart-stopping moment when he raced to the edge of his area in the 56th minute to claim. Was he inside or outside? The referee's assistant gave him the benefit of the doubt and Fabianski could exhale but not for the first time the lines with an Arsenal goalkeeper were blurred. Wenger craves a return to clarity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
