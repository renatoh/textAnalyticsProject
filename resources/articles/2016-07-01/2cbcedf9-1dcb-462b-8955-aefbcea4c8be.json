Benedict Cumberbatch, fellow stars Amanda Abbington and Mark Gatiss and show co-creator Steven Moffat were on hand at a Comic-Con panel to unveil the footage and discuss the new season, which is in the midst of filming. \u201cIt\u2019s really dark. It\u2019s the darkest Steven and Mark have written,\u201d Abbington said of coming scenes, which follow a special last year set in the Victorian era. An ominous teaser trailer for the fourth season hinted at dark times for the London detective, played by Cumberbatch. \u201cSomething\u2019s coming,\u201d says Sherlock, after his archenemy\u2019s face flickers onscreen. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Moriarty. Maybe it\u2019s not.\u201d Though the characters are cast in shadow throughout the clip, including one image of Sherlock apparently on the verge of uncharacteristic tears, the show looks set to retain its trademark mix of intrigue and humor. The new season of the BBC show, which airs on PBS in the US and could be Moffat\u2019s last, will air next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
