And it does feel [the Tour promoter] ASO fired things up when it\u2019s their responsibility to protect them.\u201d Armed police are patrolling team hotels and have been a presence at the Team Sky and Education First hotels in the past 48 hours. Extra security was introduced at the Tour following terrorist attacks in France, but Team Sky also called in security experts from BSkyB to advise on extra measures. \u201cIt is really concerning,\u201d Vaughters said of his anxieties over crowd control. \u201cThe amount of vitriol and anger directed at Sky is pretty impressive. The barriers need to go further down the mountain climbs, but you can\u2019t barrier 200 kilometres of open road.\u201d Vaughters, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, was a pivotal witness in the Usada investigation that exposed Armstrong\u2019s systemic doping programme. Yet he is among the growing numbers within cycling who have attacked the lack of confidentiality in the Froome matter. \u201cThe first thing to understand is that this was never a case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a process to determine whether they should bring a case. And 99% of the time that happens behind closed doors, in complete privacy. \u201cIn this case, it was public, which is really unfortunate and whoever leaked it \u2014 because somebody inside the UCI leaked it \u2014 it\u2019s just nasty, vindictive behaviour to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually allow the system to work in the way that it should in a case involving a restricted substance, as opposed to a banned substance.\u201d Although under normal circumstances the athlete in such a case would be expected to undergo a controlled pharmacokinetic study, this was not insisted on by Wada in Froome\u2019s case. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you would replicate that [in cycling],\u201d Vaughters said. \u201cIn any other sport in controlled environments it would be easier and you could, whereas with Froome it would have been trying to replicate the last week of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. I don\u2019t know how you do that. I think it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d But despite an onslaught of criticism of Wada\u2019s procedures, Vaughters remains supportive of the anti-doping body. \u201cI don\u2019t think Wada is broken. The people involved in anti-doping are incredibly passionate about fairness to athletes. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for years that cycling should be throwing more money into anti-doping. I think it\u2019s \u20ac140,000 that each team contributes to the biological passport, but that\u2019s like a minuscule amount of Team Sky\u2019s budget. Each team should be spending more like five per cent of its total budget on anti-doping.\u201d Vaughters insisted cycling has cleaned up its act, despite many believing that little has changed since the Festina affair of 1998. \u201cThat\u2019s just not reality,\u201d he said. \u201cI can say that all day long, but nobody\u2019s going to believe it. It\u2019s not true and I think anyone inside the sport with any genuine knowledge is going to say that\u2019s not true. Unfortunately many people look at us all sceptically. \u201cI\u2019m all for transparency once there\u2019s an ADRV [anti-doping rule violation] under way. I think those should be almost like publicly open trials so that people can see the evidence. But when you\u2019re trying to determine whether or not you\u2019re even going to bring a case, then, come on \u2026\u201d But Vaughters joined those who now think that all relevant details to the case should be made public, despite both Team Sky and Wada declining to do so. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been leaked in the first place, but it was, so live with it and now release all the information. Both sides should come to an agreement and release all the pertinent information.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
