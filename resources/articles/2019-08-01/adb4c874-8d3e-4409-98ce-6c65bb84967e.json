From where we stand, even through binoculars, the gannets are just big white blobs on the water, about 500 metres offshore. I\u2019m not convinced Paul can even see the blobs through his binoculars, which he refers to as \u201cKellogg\u2019s brand\u201d \u2013 something he got out of a packet. Kelly has taken to watching birds in recent years, but, in the field, frankly, he\u2019s a noob. Which is why, for this interview, he brought along Sean Dooley: editor of BirdLife Australia\u2019s quarterly magazine. Sean and I have been watching birds almost all our lives; we met in early 1983. I rib Kelly that he would have been playing in his first band the Dots back then, but Kelly corrects me: he\u2019d already broken the band up. I don\u2019t think he likes being reminded about the Dots. Lately, Kelly has been touring a stage production, Thirteen Ways to Look at Birds, now an album and his 25th studio recording: a collection of poems set to a neo-classical pop score, co-written and arranged with composer James Ledger, multi-instrumentalist Alice Keath and the Seraphim Trio. It\u2019s an avian extension of 2018\u2019s Nature, which became his second album to hit #1 on the Aria charts. (The first, Life is Fine, was released the year before.) Kelly tells us that he remembers magpies from when he was a kid, growing up in Adelaide. The last song on the album, The Magpies, is adapted from a poem by a New Zealander, Denis Glover: \u201cWhen Tom and Elizabeth took the farm, the bracken made their bed And quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle, the magpies said.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the sound I remember most,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cI was aware of birds but I wouldn\u2019t know which bird was which. In some ways, I\u2019m probably not that observant. Maybe I had my head more in books. But yeah, they were the birds I most remember most vividly, swooping and screaming.\u201d Kelly and Dooley have been acquainted for a while. They met at The Kick, a motley collection of Melbourne artists who would gather together in winter for the simple joy of chasing a footy around an oval. Dooley was writing comedy for Channel Seven\u2019s Full Frontal back then and would occasionally sneak a bird-themed sketch through. Dooley and I are lifelong Collingwood tragics; Kelly\u2019s team, naturally, is the Adelaide Crows, but he\u2019s got his well-worn black-and-orange Rockdogs Community Cup scarf. He can play a bit. \u201cHe\u2019s bloody hard to tackle,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cHe\u2019d run at you, like he wanted you to tackle and then he\u2019d sell the candy and just sort of shimmy around you.\u201d At home, Kelly says, he\u2019s got a treasured copy of Judith Wright\u2019s poetry about birds, two of which \u2013 Black Cockatoos and Thornbills \u2013 made it on to the album. \u201cThe thing I loved about Judith Wright\u2019s book was that at the same time as the lightness, there\u2019s also always the cruelty, the savagery, the threat of danger from the natural world.\u201d He quotes from Thornbills: \u201cOh let no enemies Drink the quick wine of blood That leaps in their pulse of praise.\u201d Dooley loves the song. The skittering, bouncing music reminds him specifically of yellow-rumped thornbills, he says, one of 12 currently recognised Australian species. \u201cIt\u2019s that synaesthesia,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cI was visualising the birds, the music suited what these birds do.\u201d Even I look at him a little doubtfully at this point. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a tribute to her words,\u201d Kelly says politely. But Dooley\u2019s not wrong, either: look along the fenceline of any paddock in south-eastern Australia and you may well see a flock of yellow-rumped thornbills, tiny balls of feathers, skittering and bouncing along, like Alice Keath\u2019s banjo and Tim Nankervis\u2019 cello moves through the song. It\u2019s freezing cold. Kelly kindly lends his Rockdogs scarf to me. On the shore, there are dozens of stilts \u2013 elegantly ridiculous black-and-white waders with bright pink legs that are, well, like stilts. Further away is a lone yellow-billed spoonbill, a bit bigger than an ibis, with a bill that is indeed yellow and spoon-shaped. Offshore, the gannets are starting to take flight. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much more to discover about birds,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cLike the gannets, when they fish, they fish by gender \u2013 the males fish at different times to the females. Just, why? Why is that happening? And they\u2019ve been around for so long, they were around long before humans.\u201d The white blobs are rising in the air, circling now. But they no longer look like blobs: on the wing, they\u2019re as streamlined as arrows and just as lethal. Gannets have spongy plates at the base of their dagger-like bills that cushion them on impact as they dive into the water, and nostrils that close over to stop water rushing in. One by one, they wheel in flight, close their wings, and plummet vertically into the bay face-first, from a height of around 80 metres. Plumes of water geyser from the surface, before they struggle back up for air and hoist themselves aloft again. And the three of us fall silent, just watching, with no music except for that made by the birds themselves, warbling away as they keep a wary eye on us, too. \u2022 Thirteen Ways To Look At Birds by Paul Kelly is out 30 August via Decca; Love Is Strong As Death \u2013 Poems Chosen by Paul Kelly comes out Penguin Books Australia. Paul Kelly\u2019s summer series of Making Gravy concerts will this year feature Courtney Barnett, Kate Miller-Heidke, Marlon William and Thelma Plum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
