Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) has the usual rows with Bones (Karl Urban), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Scotty (a Simon Pegg in a black hole) as they take on board a party of cryogenically preserved Jonahs up to no good. This batch of maledict encumbrances is under the command of Benedict Cumberbatch, a neo-Nazi advocate of the superman who puts Nietzsche before nurture with the aim of ruling the world. The film is short on the provocative ideas that Gene Roddenberry's original TV series had plenty of, but offers bangs for bucks on a prodigious scale in a succession of repetitive battles that will have the 3D glasses bouncing on everyone's nose. Alice Eve plays an extremely sexy ordnance expert, and the film brings back that \"I'm a\u2026 not a\" verbal formulation once so popular among screen scientists and professional men when confronted with inappropriate requests: \"For God's sake man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo engineer,\" says an exasperated Bones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
