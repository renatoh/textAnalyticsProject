It's hard to be cynical about the latest bunch of punk-pop wannabes, however, when you find yourself singing along to their songs on the very first listen. It's not that the tunes on their debut album are simple, just charmingly catchy - not least twitchy opener Nazanin and The Photos on My Wall, a riot of handclaps and candy-cute melody. Even when they try to strike a downbeat note, as on Morden, a depressing picture of life in the KFC-riddled suburbs, and on the lovelorn Blue Eyes, the band's sunny exuberance can't help shining through. Partly, that's down to singer Rhys Jones, whose youthful voice, often reminiscent of the Cure's Robert Smith, registers high and imbues every line with beguiling naivety. Contrived, yes - but irresistible, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
