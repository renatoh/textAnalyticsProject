They were launching their new report, Members Only - Parliament In The Public Eye. They want parliament to use the media to get its message over to the voters, and make them show an interest again in what happens in the old place. Basically they would like MPs to advertise themselves. (\"Mmm. Michael Fabricant. Because you're worth it.\") As John Sergeant pointed out, if you wanted to find out when the last debate on Iraq began, you couldn't tell, because there was nobody to tell you, and so you couldn't watch, unless you were prepared to sit through the statement on Paper Clips and String for, ooh, how long? Well, the Hansard Society could start by cutting out some of the jargon. Stuff about \"wide-ranging strategies\", based on \"accessibility and transparency, participation and responsiveness, best practice, inclusiveness, accountability...\" Aaargh! Enough already! Can you imagine young persons at school saying, \"I used to think politics was boring until I heard about inclusiveness and best practice...\"? I think not. One of their themes was that the public feels there is a too cosy relationship between politicians and the media: \"They see them as the same thing,\" as David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun put it. To explore the matter of the overly cosy relationship, we had a cosy press conference in which various politicians and members of the media who had compiled the report fielded courteous questions from members of the media and various politicians, some of whom were also members of the media, or had been members of the media before they became politicians, or possibly vice-versa. Indeed the atmosphere was so cosy that it was a relief to hear from Sir Nicholas Winterton, a man who is rarely out-pompoused, and who reminded us that he had been Chairman of Procedure for two whole parliaments. He added that it was not parliament that failed the public; it was the political parties. \"They are control freaks,\" he said. \"They not only control who stands for them but when they are here, they have to be totally on-message. \"In that case, we have a load of morons in this place!\" At this point I wanted to reprise my favourite remark about the Commons, made by an old mining MP called Bill Stone. (I have been obliged to bowdlerise the exact words he used.) Overhearing someone say that the trouble with the Commons was that it was full of morons, he remarked \"there's plenty of morons in the country, and they deserve some representation.\" (Except that the word he used was earthier than \"morons\".) Lord Puttnam felt that it was the old pile itself that created problems. \"The public sees Portcullis House as modern,\" he said, though some of us think that it resembles an incinerator with windows. \"This building is more like a mausoleum or shrine.\" Was he going to pull it down? he was asked. No, of course not, he replied. On the other hand you could keep it up and turn it into the country's largest All Bar One. My suspicion is that many MPs don't actually want more coverage . They would like less. They are quite happy with what Martha Kearney called \"green bench sync\", by which the camera can linger over long empty benches, all proof that most MPs have something much better to do with their time than listen to other MPs talking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
