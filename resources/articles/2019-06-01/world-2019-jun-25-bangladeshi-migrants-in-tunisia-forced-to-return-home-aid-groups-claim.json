They were among 75 migrants rescued on 31 May by the Maridive 601, an Egyptian tugboat that services offshore oil platforms, only to spend the next 20 days at sea near the Tunisian coast. The International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental organisation linked to the United Nations, said the Bangladeshis \u201cwished to return home\u201d. But relatives and aid groups claimed that when a Bangladeshi envoy visited the boat the migrants were forced to accept their repatriation under the threat of having food, water and medical treatment being taken away. One relative told the Guardian: \u201cWhen all the people were on the boat, they were told by the Bangladeshi embassy that if they didn\u2019t agree to sign, they would not get any food or water any more. The people were afraid to die on the boat. The Bangladeshi embassy forced them to sign.\u201d On 18 June, the 75 migrants, who included Egyptian, Moroccan and Sudanese people, were taken off the Maridive 601 and transferred to a Tunisian detention centre. The IOM confirmed that a few days later the first 17 individuals were returned to Bangladesh, and on 24 June, another 15 migrants were sent back. It said \u201cmore migrants will be travelling in the coming days, according to their decision\u201d. The Forum Tunisien pour les Droits Economiques et Sociaux (FTDES), an independent organisation that aims to defend economic and social rights, said: \u201cWe doubt that the decisions to return were made voluntarily by the migrants. \u201cWe have tried to visit the migrants in the reception centre in order to inquire about their wellbeing but despite making repeated inquiries and requests, the whereabouts of the detained migrants was not revealed.\u201d Another relative said: \u201cI spoke with my brother this morning in the centre. He is scared to be returned to Bangladesh, like all the people there. Nobody wants to return to Bangladesh; everyone who is returned is forced.\u201d The IOM\u2019s head of mission in Tunisia, Lorena Lando, rejected the accusations. \u201cNone of the migrants has been deported; [they] wished to return,\u201d she said. \u201cIOM does not do deportation, nor force anyone to return.\u201d Lando said the IOM \u201cdid not have access\u201d to the migrants until 19 June, after the Tunisian authorities allowed their disembarkation. She added: \u201cRemaining at sea was not a solution either. It is up to the person to also apply for asylum if they fear persecution \u2026 or seek help to return home or take time to decide.\u201d A spokesperson for Alarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea that was alerted to the ship\u2019s plight by crew members, said: \u201cThe IOM refers to such deportations as voluntary returns but what is voluntary about telling survivors that they can leave their prison merely if they agree to be returned? \u201cDo we really believe that these Bangladeshi people risked their lives to move to Libya and then to try to cross the Mediterranean, only to then be \u2018voluntarily\u2019 returned to Bangladesh?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
