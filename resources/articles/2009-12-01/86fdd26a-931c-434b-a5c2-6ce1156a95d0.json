However, Strokes singer Julian Casablancas's debut, Phrazes for the Young, is full of the vim and cool of the New York band, with added textures from 1980s pop and untypically candid lyrics. Not that you'd know any of that from this shambolic show. His band seem so unfamiliar with one another, they might well have met in the lift, and the lineup includes two percussionists who don't seem able to play in time with each other, never mind a band. There's no bass player but two keyboards, one emitting a low bass burble that drowns out everything else. Somewhere is Casablancas's swaggering New York croon, inaudible amid the cacophony \u2013 you might as well have tried to listen to Out of the Blue while someone demolished a building. Only a \"cover song\" \u2013 the 2006 Strokes demo I'll Try Anything Once \u2013 survives, a keyboard and the singer's voice accompanied by the massed chorus of the crowd. After just seven songs, the band leave the stage, presumably for some sort of pep talk. The three further songs sound considerably better. With typical ennui, Casablancas explains that he has been showing up late for rehearsals. He insists he \"doesn't know\" his surprisingly good festive single, I Wish It Was Christmas Today, but it sounds a riot of urgent cool with jingling bells on. As the singer in one of the era-defining bands of the noughties, the leather-jacketed singer radiates effortless charisma, but even this most fashionably languid of modern rock stars should realise he is not above hard work.
