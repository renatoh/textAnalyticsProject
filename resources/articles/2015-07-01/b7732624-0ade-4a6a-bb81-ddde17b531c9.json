Britain\u2019s 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic and world champion had planned to take down Dave Moorcroft\u2019s long-standing 3,000m British record of 7:32.79 \u2013 one of the few UK middle-distance records he does not now own \u2013 but heavy legs soon persuaded him otherwise. Instead he was content to bask in both an easy victory and the melodious acclaim of his home crowd. Some had feared that Farah might get a mixed reaction because of his late withdrawal from last month\u2019s Diamond League meeting in Birmingham, which upset some punters who had paid \u00a350 for grandstand seats. But when he appeared on the giant TV screens an hour beforehand to tell the crowd \u201cHello everyone, I\u2019m back, show your support!\u201d he received a warm, if not wildly raucous, reception. The 40,000 crowd was just taking its time to warm up. The volume was ratcheted up several notches when he appeared on the track \u2013 before blasting out its appreciation when he took the lead with 500m remaining, coming through to win in 7:34.66. Afterwards Farah called the crowd \u201camazing\u201d and claimed the support of the public ever since the accusations about his coach, Alberto Salazar, had first surfaced had been \u201cincredible\u201d. \u201cIt was amazing to get the support I got \u2013 it reminded me of 2012 and it was so exciting to be back in the stadium, the stadium which has changed my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you get the Olympics right on your doorstep and to win two gold medals changed my life.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous,\u201d he added. \u201cYou do what you do best, which is run and enjoy it.\u201d In the end his time was good enough to be a new stadium record but outside Moorcroft\u2019s best. Farah did not beat much: the Ethiopian Yenew Alamirew was the only other elite level runner in the field. But after his efforts in Lausanne a fortnight ago \u2013 when he thrashed a top-quality 5,000m field \u2013and again last week in Monaco, where he ran a 3:28 in the 1,500m, it was about time he had an easier race. \u201cTo be honest I was interested in the British record but I felt a bit tired at the start and I didn\u2019t feel that good. Sometimes as an athlete you have to make a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking at the screen and I thought, \u2018Do I want to win the race or do I want to go for time?\u2019\u201d And, as he revealed afterwards, there was something else that had made him weary. Last Friday he had flown back to Portland in the United States for his daughter\u2019s 10th birthday. \u201cI was a little bit tired after Monaco,\u201d he added. \u201cI went back home. You know it\u2019s important for me because family means everything. We had a good party for her and then I came back, so I was tired. \u201cI go training tomorrow so I won\u2019t see my family until after the world championships. \u201cIt was good to see the twins but one of them was really disappointed because I dropped her off at school and her mum picked her up and she was like \u2018Where is daddy?\u2019 And because I was on a plane she was so angry.\u201d Farah also confirmed that this would be his last race before he goes to his training camp in Font Romeu in the Pyrenees to prepare for next month\u2019s world championships in Beijing. He also deftly deflected questions about Salazar. \u201cI just love and enjoy what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician \u2013 Mo Farah just runs.\u201d And how."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
