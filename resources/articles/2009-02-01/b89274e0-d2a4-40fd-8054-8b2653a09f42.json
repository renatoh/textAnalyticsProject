The International FA Board (IFAB), the game's rule-makers, yesterday gave the go-ahead for new trials of Platini's plan in a professional league next season. The Italian Cup will be the first guinea pig and the French FA has also offered to trial the scheme. Platini said trials in England's Championship could also be a good idea. \"I am sure it will happen,\" said Platini. \"The decision will be made in 2011 so if it's agreed then it will be used in Euro 2012. First we have to study it in a top league with atmosphere and TV cameras. Something like England's Championship could be a good idea.\" Platini said the extra assistants could also help the referee on decisions such as penalties and handballs. Goalline technology will also be assessed by a new report from Adidas and the German company Cairos Technology. The IFAB also rejected a proposal by the Irish FA for sin-bins, and by the Scottish FA for a fourth substitute to be allowed in extra-time. Meanwhile, Fifa abandoned its controversial proposal, revealed in Observer Sport last week, to extend the half-time break from 15 to 20 minutes after opposition from the home nations. The IFAB comprises representatives of the four home associations, who each have a vote, and Fifa, who have four. Any rule change needs at least six votes in favour. Chelsea eye new keeperChelsea have begun a search for a goalkeeper to put pressure on Petr Cech, writes Duncan Castles. Individuals within the club have been concerned by a perceived drop in the Czech Republic international's standards and believe the summer signing of another high-quality keeper will improve Cech's performances. Room has already been created in Chelsea's squad by allowing Carlo Cudicini to leave on a free transfer to Tottenham in the January window. Cudicini has struggled with injuries in recent seasons, often being unavailable at the same time as Cech was, and the Italian was not well regarded by the former manager Luiz Felipe Scolari. Cech had a difficult relationship with Scolari, and also publicly expressed his concerns with the decline in Chelsea's defensive strengths under the Brazilian. However, he believes the changes brought to Chelsea's training regime and play by the new manager, Guus Hiddink, will revitalise the club. \"He has brought something new again,\" said Cech. \"A lot of things changed in a good way. You can see in the last games we played as a team, we worked hard and we got good results so hopefully we can keep going. Leeds want Klimavicius Leeds are close to signing the Lithuania defender Arunas Klimavicius to strengthen the club's challenge for promotion from League One. Klimavicius, 26, is available on a free after his contract expired at Dynamo Moscow. He has been a regular for his national team, specialising at left-back. Alan Pardew is a surprise candidate for the vacant manager's job at Brighton. The former Charlton manager, who lives in Sussex, has been out of work since being sacked in November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
