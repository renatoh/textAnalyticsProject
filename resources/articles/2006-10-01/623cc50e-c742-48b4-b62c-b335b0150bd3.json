The queen makes an appearance in these stories, in which a breach in a wall or a previously unnoticed pathway frequently opens from the world of historical fact into that of fairytale fiction. So do John Aubrey and the first Duke of Wellington, and characters familiar from other literary sources: the Queen Mab whom Mercutio describes so eloquently (here demoted to plain Mrs Mabb, but still fearsomely malicious and as powerful as she is diminutive); Rumpelstiltskin (masquerading - true to form - under an assumed name). And, finally, so do several characters familiar to readers of Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, the compendious and inventive novel to which these stories bear the same kind of relation that a needlewoman's antickes and frets would bear to her main composition. The eponymous heroes of that novel were both magicians, although sparing in their use of their sensational craft. Norrell was an Encyclopaedist, Strange a Romantic (Diderot and Coleridge are namechecked in these stories, as they never were in the novel). In writing about their adventures, natural and supernatural, Clarke drew a rich and persuasive picture of late-18th and early-19th-century European culture. Norrell was a pedant, a man of the Enlightenment who believed the thing to do with arcane knowledge was to draw it out of concealment, to tabulate it and thus get it under control. Strange (with whose growing ascendancy the novel became more and more entertaining) had a view that was both more modern and more antiquarian, more lyrical and more balladic. His project (which ended disastrously for him personally) was to recharge the potency of quaint stories and discredited beliefs. He aimed not to confine magic to the library, but to release it, and employ it for war and business and the gratification of desire. These stories appear to be offcuts from different phases of that prodigious work. The title story is actually an excised episode from the novel's plot, in which Strange visits his brother-in-law, a country parson, and finds himself challenged by three very decorous female magicians, weird sisters masquerading as governesses in Regency frocks. Another is a ribald piece of pseudo-folklore about the medieval magician John Uskglass, aka the Raven King, who was at the centre of the intensely Romantic mythology of a wild, rain-swept, English otherworld which was the most haunting territory of Clarke's fictional landscape. It's the kind of tale which might well have made a footnote in Strange and Norrell, where Clarke used her mock-critical apparatus to suggest that her main narrative was founded on an entire hypothetical counter-culture, involving an alternative history of Britain and a great mine of invented folklore, learned inquiry and belief. Other stories range from a playful piece of 17th-century pastiche, in which spiteful fairies and pompous scholars are equally mocked, through some slight but pretty exercises in historical fantasy, to the fine \"Mr Simonelli and the Fairy Widower\". Simonelli, the unreliable and otherwise morally deplorable narrator, is the bastard child of an elusive stranger who might have been Italian, but was actually a fairy. In his story Clarke plays (as she did in her novel) with analogies between racial otherness and the uncanny, while simultaneously presenting us with a narrative of subtly layered ironies set in a vividly evoked landscape, part Peak District, part fantasy of Burkean sublimity. These stories are as uneven as left-overs are likely to be, but the good ones are very, very good. One quibble. Clarke has a gift for description. Her settings, with their livid grey light, dismal pools and sinister traces of human architecture, are vivid to the reader. Her fairies, conversely, are brilliantly indeterminate, too frighteningly protean ever to become cute or ridiculous. What a shame then that this volume, like Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, should be so insistently and inappropriately illustrated. The novel's pictures suffered from the kind of mimsy-whimsy that the text so signally avoided; this time illustrator Charles Vess has provided pictures and decorations which are sadly anachronistic, owing a bit to Rackham, a bit to Beardsley, and nothing at all to the much earlier artists - Piranesi, Fuseli, John Martin - that Clarke's best stories seem to invoke. \u00b7 Lucy Hughes-Hallett's books include Cleopatra (Pimlico)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
