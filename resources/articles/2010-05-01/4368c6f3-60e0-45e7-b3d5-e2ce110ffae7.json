He laid down an attractive vision of how the economy should be \u2013 \"well-paid jobs, rising living standards, the sense that each year we are providing more for our families and moving forward as a country\" \u2013 but without any sense of how it would happen. Worse than that, by slashing public spending now with the economy still so fragile, the prime minister will jeopardise precisely those objectives \u2013 a balanced and diverse economy, finally weaned off its addiction to financial services and the housing market, and offering higher wages to more workers \u2013 that he claims to care so much about. No doubt about it, Mr Cameron can spot the symptoms of the UK's economic sickness: \"our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country\", with jobs north of the Watford Gap largely created by the public, not the private, sector, and banks now unwilling to lend. This is the benefit of being a new occupant of No 10: Mr Cameron can clearly identify the huge flaws in the British business model. That said, the Conservative leader is poor at joining up all these telltale signs into a convincing diagnosis; and his prescribed treatment is way off beam. The dangerously lopsided British economy was not magically invented by Gordon Brown in his dark lab at the Treasury in 1997. No, the biggest and most serious charge that can be laid at the former iron chancellor's door is that he did too little to put things right. Just like his Tory predecessors, Mr Brown continued to let free markets rip and largely treated the decline of manufacturing and other industries as the inevitable by-product of globalisation: China did the heavy labour, Germany and Silicon Valley did the smart technology, and Britain did finance and housing bubbles. Everyone knows what happened next. Indeed, everyone will be paying for the resulting pile-up in taxes and cuts to public services for the next decade. That is where untrammelled markets gets you. But what is the Tory solution? More of the same \u2013 or, as Mr Cameron put it yesterday, \"getting out of the way of business\" by slashing taxes and burning red tape. Throughout his speech there was barely a mention of the market meltdown of the past few years, just a constant reiteration that government was the problem and needed to be hacked back. However hard one squints, this does not look like New Conservatism: this is Margaret Thatcher speaking through a ventriloquist's dummy. Take one problem. One of the charges George Osborne rightly made against Labour was that it spent much of the last decade undertaxing its way to create what was by the Great Crash a small budget deficit. Yet the Tories propose to cut taxes further \u2013 especially those on business. Take another problem. The \"British disease\" after the second world war was that shareholders would take the profits made by companies they owned in dividends rather than ploughing them back into the business. In essence, the profits of UK plc bought yachts in St Tropez rather than new machinery. Mr Brown tried to do something about this, by giving tax breaks on business investment, and yet the Tories will scrap those reliefs to bring down corporation tax. Finally, there is the problem of banks not channelling credit to deserving businesses. A smart prime minister would follow the advice of the New Economics Foundation in its Better Banking campaign and direct the nationalised banks to lend more to green startups and other companies that could kickstart Britain's industrial renaissance. Instead, Mr Cameron yesterday promised only to keep talking to the bankers and their lobbyists. Good on the final destination but feeble on how to get there, the prime minister's economic ideology is stronger on ideology than it is on economics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
