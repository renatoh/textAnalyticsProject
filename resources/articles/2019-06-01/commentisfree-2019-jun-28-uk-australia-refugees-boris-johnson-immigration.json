After breaking the ice with a comment about how much I must love Fosters (I\u2019ve never tried it) and dropping a reference I didn\u2019t understand to 1990s-era Neighbours, they\u2019d get to the real meat (on the barbie) of our conversation. \u201cSo,\u201d they\u2019d say, cheerfully, \u201cAustralia is really racist, right?\u201d They weren\u2019t wrong. Australia is really racist. But for a (usually white) British person to be smug about the racism of a nation that Britain colonised, while enacting genocide against the indigenous population, seemed a little hypocritical. Racism, like rabbits and tuberculosis, was a pest that Britain dropped on the island before disappearing and letting us sort it out for ourselves. And unfortunately we can\u2019t just release myxomatosis and hope racism dies frothing at the mouth in public parks. Still, there\u2019s no denying that, while the early white settlers in Australia might have introduced racism, subsequent generations have nurtured and honed it. So it was no surprise that Boris Johnson, a man with a true talent for racist comments, decided to enthusiastically endorse Australia\u2019s current immigration policy while ignoring the mandatory detention of refugees in prison-like facilities. While discussing positions he would take if he becomes prime minister (an increasingly likely scenario \u2013 everything is so terrible), Johnson said, \u201cWe must be tougher on those who abuse our hospitality. Other countries such as Australia have great systems and we should learn from them.\u201d He singled out scientists as the type of migrants the UK should be welcoming, though given his party\u2019s long-running inaction on the climate emergency he may want to rethink that. Johnson stanning Australia\u2019s immigration system while ignoring the brutal treatment of refugees (which, not to brag, has been repeatedly condemned by the United Nations and is considered a human rights emergency by Amnesty International) is no surprise. If Johnson is famous for anything, it\u2019s bad hair and worse opinions. But it is part of a curious tradition of British people becoming fascinated by \u2013 and subsequently bastardising \u2013 Australian culture. Have you ever been to a Walkabout? I have, once, and it will haunt me for the rest of my life. It was 5pm on a Thursday and I was in Liverpool with a group of locals who thought it would be a nice idea to take me somewhere \u201cfamiliar\u201d. I\u2019ve been in a lot of terrible Australian pubs (again, bragging) but none of them matched the lurid misery of this Walkabout. From the disappointing (at least make the beer cold if you\u2019re faking a hot climate) to the offensive (I am fairly certain those \u201cdecorations\u201d were not provided by Indigenous artists) to the completely baffling (neon tubing is actually a very minor part of Aussie decor), it was a surreal carnival version of my home country. Consider also the case of Peter Andre. Not content to let him be an exceptionally ab-having crooner, Britain plucked him from our sunny shores. You lot then dropped him directly into the reality TV morass where recent interviews suggest he had a pretty rough time of it. And then there\u2019s the avocado issue. Now, I\u2019m a fan of avocados, a millennial and a homeowner, though the media would tell you such a person doesn\u2019t exist (the trick is that homeownership is less about bread fillings and more about inherited wealth). And for many years Australians enjoyed our nice green toast in peace. But London cafes have picked up the trend and are now selling it at bonkers prices despite the fact that avocados in England are terrible. They taste of nothing! The brunch emperor has no clothes! Rupert Murdoch, uncomfortably humid summers, Holly Valance, the use of the C-word in casual conversations \u2013 Brits have a tendency to take Australian ideas and push them to terrible extremes. And in suggesting that Britain adopt our dystopian policies, Johnson has hit on one of the touchstones that unites our two nations \u2013 state-sanctioned racism; though how you could push offshore detention centres to an even more terrible extreme I don\u2019t know. Avocados may not travel well across the oceans but it seems that cruelty does. Imagining the horrors of Australia replicated here is enough to drive a person to drink \u2013 but don\u2019t make it a Fosters. \u2022 Brydie Lee-Kennedy is an Australian-born, London-based columnist and writer for TV and theatre"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
