It is the lushness of the grass, the flawlessly cut edges and the uniformity that make visitors to historic estates feel they have to tiptoe their way across. But this autumn the National Trust is asking the public to linger for longer and appreciate - and count - the rare toadstools at their feet. The focus of their attention is to be the waxcap toadstool. Naturalists have long considered the waxcap a rarity. However, some mycologists believe they are more common than previously thought and sightings are on the increase. Unexpected appearances are also causing a stir among fungi enthusiasts with rainbow-coloured waxcaps appearing outside the traditional autumn fruiting season. This year one of the first recorded examples was in June and it is thought that the waxcap season is lengthening due to mild winters. 'Waxcaps are appearing later in the year because there are fewer frosts and it is now quite possible to see them at Christmas,' said Dr David Bullock, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust. Waxcaps appear on grassland where the soil has been undisturbed for a long time - such as the lawns around stately homes and ancient monuments, including Stonehenge. Churchyards and cemeteries are also good sites. With so many historic estates, the UK is a stronghold for waxcaps, being home to two thirds of the 60 European varieties. The ballerina waxcap is thought to be better represented here than anywhere in the world and can be seen in good numbers in country house and stately home gardens, including Petworth House, Sussex, and Charles Darwin's former home, Down House, in Kent. The population of waxcaps declined across Europe after the late 1940s when grasslands were built on and agricultural fields treated more intensively with fertilisers. Unploughed and unimproved grassland became an increasingly rare habitat. 'If a waxcap grassland is ploughed, it could take centuries for the toadstools to reappear,' said Peter Brash, a biologist at the National Trust. 'They are signs of antiquity and an important part of our estates' heritage alongside tapestries, paintings and furniture.' The concern over loss of old grasslands in recent years has led to calls by conservationists to track down waxcaps. In particular, the charity Plantlife launched a nationwide campaign to find ballerina waxcaps. With its pink tutu-like cap, the fungus is hard to miss and many fungi foragers joined in the search. Enough sightings were recorded from this and other studies for experts to de-list it as a priority species under the Biodiversity Action Plan scheme. There are about 40 other varieties of waxcaps in the UK and still little is known about their distribution. 'In the past, biologists often overlooked lawns,' says Brash. 'Now, they are more widely recognised as an important habitat and for their biodiversity value in terms of lower plants such as mosses and fungi. But the truth is we have little idea of where our waxcap grasslands are.' From now until December, the National Trust is asking the public to look out for waxcaps. Those wishing to take part should visit nationaltrust.org.uk/waxcaps Tempting toadstools \u00b7 Look for waxcaps where there is a lot of moss and the grass is kept short. \u00b7 Some of the best waxcap grasslands in the UK are: Knightshayes Court, Devon; Wimpole Park, Cambs; Longshaw Estate, Peak District; St Kilda, Hebrides; Hardwick Hall, Derbys; Castle Coole, Co. Fermanagh; Powis Castle, Powys; Down House, Kent; and Lyme Park, Cheshire. \u00b7 Watch out, too, for fairy clubs, which may be found with waxcaps . They are brightly coloured and have a peculiar coral or finger-like fruiting body."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
