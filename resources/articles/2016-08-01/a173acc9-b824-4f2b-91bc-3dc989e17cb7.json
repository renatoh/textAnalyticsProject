Nineteen BMW i8s \u2013 eco-friendly hybrid supercars, apparently \u2013 were delivered to the ground as rewards for the players who secured that historic victory. Each car is worth around \u00a3100,000 but the players, having decided to use their title-winning bonus to treat themselves to new wheels, negotiated a bulk discount along with the chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. It is another example, then, of Leicester\u2019s potent teamwork. The message Ranieri is eager to drive home is that such teamwork must continue if Leicester are to enjoy further success. And he craves further success. \u201cI was satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I am hungry. I want to eat something.\u201d Last season was the most sensational Premier League title win in history but Ranieri told his players it is just that: history. \u201cI said: \u2018I know you very well now. Forget what we have achieved; I want more,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me: \u2018This is my maximum.\u2019 I want more than the maximum of last season.\u201d Ranieri expects this season to be much tougher than last because United, Manchester City and Chelsea have made radical changes in an attempt to atone for underperformance while Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur could also be stronger \u2013 and all are dead set on making Leicester\u2019s reign at the top short-lived. \u201cNow there are six big teams who want to win, they want to kill us,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cThat is normal. We are the champions but we are still the underdogs. But I don\u2019t want my players to ever give up against them. We can lose but I want to see them playing together as a team, helping each other. Suffer for your team-mates, that is my philosophy. Last season we did something that is hard to repeat. We know that very well but I want the maximum from everybody.\u201d Ranieri says that since his summer training regime has been geared towards getting his players ready for the opening league match at Hull City next Saturday, they will be at about 60% of their capacities against United at Wembley. \u201cI want to see 100% of that 60%,\u201d he said. There is a certain symmetry to Leicester raising the curtain against a side managed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. For a start Mourinho\u2019s last competitive match in English football was against Leicester \u2013 he was sacked by Chelsea after the 2-1 defeat at the King Power in December \u2013 but in addition the sight of Mourinho serves as a timely warning to how quickly title-winning teams can unravel. While taking care not to give any verdict on the disharmony at Stamford Bridge last season, Ranieri said he had no fears about the stability of his team. \u201cMy philosophy is to watch only my own house and my house is very clean,\u201d he said. He pointed out with pride that even clubs where he has been dismissed have enjoyed success after he left, notably Valencia and Chelsea, the managers who followed him benefiting from his work. \u201cWhen I have built something, it has never been destroyed. Here I think we have built a very strong foundation.\u201d He said, however, that Leicester could be weakened by the loss of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has moved to Chelsea. The Frenchman is the only one of last season\u2019s champions to have left but he was such a dynamic influence in midfield that the manager is not sure he can be adequately replaced, even though the club spent around \u00a310m to sign Nampalys Mendy from Nice. Ranieri said he drew encouragement from the way the club adapted to the absence of two key midfielders last season, when Esteban Cambiasso moved to Greece before the campaign kicked off and Matty James was sidelined by a long-term injury. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how big is the hole [left by Kant\u00e9],\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cBut it was the same last season. We found the solution. Now we have to restart and watch how we manage to play without Kant\u00e9.\u201d Mendy is one of five summer recruits as Leicester seek to build a squad that can defend the title and make a successful debut in the Champions League. Last season Ranieri belied his reputation for rotating teams as he used fewer players than any other manager in the Premier League but he says the demands of the forthcoming campaign will force him to revive an old epithet. \u201cWe have a lot of competitions this season so we need a lot of players,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tinkerman comes back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
