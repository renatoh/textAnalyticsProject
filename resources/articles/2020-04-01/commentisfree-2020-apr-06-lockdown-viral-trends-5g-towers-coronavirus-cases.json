My own loose theory is that you could use them to track much more than just the spread of coronavirus: change the label on the x axis and every one of them could easily represent data on how many people in the UK are currently getting too into jigsaws, for example, or growing very weak moustaches, or grappling with a sourdough. (The frighteningly steep lines depicting the out-of-control spread of new cases also neatly illustrate the world\u2019s horniness pandemic \u2013 with everyone locked inside and the rising sap of spring, this is arguably the most sexually desperate moment in all of human history. Look at the graphs. The planet has never been hornier.) The graphs are also neatly tracking two other viral trends right now: \u201cbeing extremely furious at your neighbours\u201d and \u201cburning down a 5G tower because Facebook told you to\u201d. Both have really skyrocketed this week \u2013 we are outperforming even Italy in burning down our 5G towers! \u2013 but also have yet to reach a pinnacle, let alone a long curve down. We\u2019ll take each one in turn. First, Neighbourhood Watch has now gone nuclear. Britain has always had a fine tradition of curtain-twitching \u2013 does any other culture have such reverence for net curtains, to comment on people\u2019s parking, how big their weekly shop is, how often their grownup daughter does or does not visit with the kids? In lockdown, the government has given us all a gift by issuing behavioural guidelines but not actually making them sovereign \u2013 so we all get the pleasure of helping to enforce the rules. What that should mean in theory is we come together as a great neighbourly morass, pooling resources and scheduling our trips to help the infirm and the quarantined, one great big blitz spirit effort to get through this, together. What it actually means is once a week we all get furious at each other about going to the park. Even I have fallen into this trap, and I\u2019m normal. More than once this week I\u2019ve been out on my still-permitted daily walk and thought: \u201cWow, a lot of people in this park. Go home, idiots.\u201d I have thought that thought, while in a park, presumably while other people in the park have looked at me and thought: \u201cWow, look at that guy in the park. Go home, idiot.\u201d There is a divide down the nation, now. First, the Virtuous Saints, who read the government guidelines like a Bible and live by them, and get really arsey with you when you walk slightly too close to them on the pavement even if the pavement is quite narrow and they are right in the damn middle of it \u2013 and who have this sort of divine blind spot to their own presence outside, in the forbidden and unholy places. Then we have the Sinners, people without gardens who go and lie down in a park on weekends when it\u2019s sunny or think a bike ride (which the government still deems \u201cacceptable\u201d) is acceptable. We all want to do our bit, I understand that. We all have a weird kink for the Keep Calm and Carry On spirit of the NHS in crisis. But I do think we\u2019re about a week away from riots breaking out between Good Outside People and Bad Outside People. Then A&amp;E departments are going to have to mop all that up, and the whole fracas will unflatten the curve and keep us all inside for an extra six weeks. Piers Morgan is going to do a really pink-in-the-face Good Morning Britain bit calling them all \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m going to have to grit my teeth and watch as that goes righteously viral. Our other new national sport is apparently burning down 5G towers \u2013 inspired by what even fact fans must admit is a world-class conspiracy theory, which elegantly blends our fear of disease with our fear of China and our fear of new technology nobody really understands to begin with. As the BBC reports, there have been at least three mast fires in the past week \u2013 in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling \u2013 but the graphs tell us there are surely more on the way. Last week broadcasters were told by Ofcom that they\u2019d face sanctions if they spread baseless 5G theories, after the community radio station Uckfield FM gave airtime to a woman who introduced herself as a \u201cregistered nurse\u201d (who you might expect to be in a hospital rather than typing out long Facebook posts about how 5G infected bats in Wuhan with corona), who explained that 5G is somehow sucking the air out of our lungs, along with other stuff that has gained a weird traction on WhatsApp and made people harass fibre-optics engineers in the street. As a precautionary measure I went out to get some tinfoil to wrap around my head but all the shelves had been raided. There has been speculation that 5G disinformation has connections to Russia, like all the finest disinformation \u2013 as the Verge pointed out in a new report on Britain\u2019s world-beating cellular arson industry, the New York Times warned last year that Moscow\u2019s propaganda channels were pushing stories that 5G led to brain cancer, infertility, Alzheimer\u2019s, autism and heart tumours. But even if the stories come from Russia, it still takes British people to believe them before a cell tower gets burned down in Merseyside. For some reason, destroying forward-thinking technology \u2013 which is also particularly useful for, say, staying in touch with people without leaving the house, which in my opinion is a vaguely useful service right now \u2013 because you\u2019re worried about it impacting on your health, all while an unseen and real threat actually does impact on people\u2019s health, seems to me a particularly British unreaction to this whole mess. We\u2019re living through history, and we\u2019re living through it abominably. Kids will be learning about this in schools, one day. Think about that next time you politicise sun exposure and set fire to a big lamppost. \u2022 Joel Golby is a writer for the Guardian and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
