And so his agent organised a dinner at the Adelphi Hotel in London. To read the list of the guests today is to be struck by the provisional nature of literary fame. Who now reads Maurice Baring or EC Bentley? Wyndham Lewis is remembered by a coterie and AP Herbert is as dead as Punch. JB Morton and his laboured Beachcomber humour seems as fustian as Gilbert and Sullivan, while the literary journalist JC Squire - once a national arbiter of taste - is read only to be reviled as a tweedy reactionary. Of those gathered to raise a glass to Belloc's celebrity, perhaps only GK Chesterton can be rescued from the sands of time. And the composite figure of a Chester-Belloc is still remembered for the sheer range of its hatreds. Progressivism, scientism, Jews, the modern state, Protestantism: all felt the force of that combined lash. But on that evening a very jolly quaffing time was had by all. The highlight was provided by Maurice Baring's recital of a Horatian ode to \"Hilario Belloc\" - a work composed in Latin by Ronald Knox specially for the occasion. Guests threw pellets of bread at the glass of burgundy balanced on Baring's head as he performed. The assertive masculinity of the evening, its japes and impishness, was a fine tribute to Belloc, the Oxford undergraduate who never quite grew up. He is now best remembered for his rhymes, and their sophisticated rendering of a child-like joy in subversion. But the sense of chaos was there from the beginning. Belloc was born outside Paris in 1870 just as the forces of the Prussianism he loathed were about to flatten France. The early death of his father made for a complicated relationship with his native soil. He was brought up in London by his English mother, and then educated at Cardinal Newman's oratory school in Birmingham. He would always seem very French to the English, and very English to the French. England to Belloc meant beer and Sussex (\"my county\"!), epic walks through her countryside, and vigorous rants against the socialism and the capitalism that threatened her in equal measure. Although briefly a Liberal MP, he was a prophetic figure in his campaigns against the party system's chicanery. He was a believer in distributivism, in trade unions, and in the dispersal of power by \"subsidiarity\". He was a poetic version of Jacques Delors. But if central authority was anathema in his politics, it was central to his religion. He brought to English religious writing a propagandist romanticism that is best heard in The Path to Rome, that lyrical description of his walk across western Europe. And his apologetics breaks away from the Chestertonian insistence on paradox, which so often turns into a kind of tired literary trick. Authority was important because Belloc's own life was so often a mess, and sometimes tragic. He lost his wife when he was 43, and two sons died in two separate world wars. He was perennially hard up, which is why he had to write so much. Much of the output is sheer hackery. But even when he was writing to order, genius kept peeping through. The book on Paris he published in 1900 is still the best popular history of the city in English: a work infused by Belloc's intuitive understanding of Latin order and spiritual romance. In this largely uncritical work, Joseph Pearce skates over the question of Belloc's anti-semitism, the central disfiguring fact of his oeuvre. The Dreyfus trial was central to Belloc's evolution, and he really did see international \"Jewry\" as a rootless, cosmopolitan force. Jewishness meant not the rabbi of Galilee but all the forces of materialism. This went far beyond the casual anti-semitism of a John Buchan. For all his vigorous good fellowship, Belloc was a solitary. He refused the Companionship of Honour because of the company he would have to keep. And as the pugilistic outsider, he raised controversy to rare literary heights. He took on HG Wells's Outline of History and subjected it to a campaign of literary vilification, arguing that it was a simplistic piece of pseudo-science. He confronted the Protestant-establishment arrogance of the Whig theory of history. Instead he wrote a suggestive and imaginative series of counter-factual histories, which tried to make Catholicism basic to England rather than a minority voice. In his own way - unlike most of the others at that dinner - Belloc was a modernist. He had broken away from the gloomy pantheism of late-Victorian England, and all that Tennysonian moaning. And he also differed sharply from the Bloomsbury cult of personal relations as the key to life. For all the posturing, the bellowing and the hatred, he remains an utterly individual literary presence - one poised between two countries and two worlds. He is the interpreter of the France of his imagination to England as he wished her to be. And he is the romantic poet of rational order, grasped all the more fervently as the 20th-century chaos came beating at his door. \u00b7 Hywel Williams is the author of Guilty Men: Conservative Decline and Fall 1992-1997"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
