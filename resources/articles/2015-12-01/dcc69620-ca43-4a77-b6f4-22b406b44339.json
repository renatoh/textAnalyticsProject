The Department of Homeland Security is preparing for raids that would see hundreds of recently arrived immigrants deported, according to a report in the Washington Post. Citing anonymous sources, the report said that adults and children \u201cwould be detained wherever they can be found and immediately deported\u201d. The operation would focus on people who entered the US from its south-west border since the start of 2014, many of whom are assumed to be escaping gang violence and institutional collapse in Central America. It would also focus on people who have already been ordered to leave by an immigration judge, according to the Post. A Guardian investigation in October found that people deported by the US government back to Central America often face an imminent threat of violence, and in some cases have been murdered soon after their return. Immigrant rights\u2019 advocates also condemned the plan. Michelle Bran\u00e9, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice Program of the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, said she was disappointed to learn about the Obama administration\u2019s plan. \u201cTo me, the image of pulling women and children and sending them back to one of the most dangerous places in the world over the Christmas holiday is extremely disappointing and does not show the kind of leadership that this administration has been saying they want to take on migration and refugees,\u201d Bran\u00e9 said. The nationwide campaign would be led by US immigration customs and enforcement (ICE) agents and could begin in early January, the Post said. ICE press secretary Gillian Christensen said in an email that the agency focuses \u201con individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security\u201d, following immigration enforcement priorities set out by the Department of Homeland Security in November 2014. \u201cThese include individuals, whether alone or with family members, who have been apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States, recent border crossers, and individuals who have received a final order of removal on or after January 1, 2014,\u201d Christensen said. Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton, Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders roundly denounced the plan. Sanders said in a statement that he was \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by the report. \u201cOur nation has always been a beacon of hope, a refuge for the oppressed,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe cannot turn our backs on that essential element of who we are as a nation. We need to take steps to protect children and families seeking refuge here, not cast them out.\u201d O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, said that the plan \u201cis completely at odds with our character as a nation\u201d. A spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton said the Democratic frontrunner had \u201creal concerns\u201d about the report. \u201cShe believes it is critical that everyone has a full and fair hearing, and that our country provides refuge to those that need it,\u201d said Clinton spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa. \u201cAnd we should be guided by a spirit of humanity and generosity as we approach these issues.\u201d Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said that the lack of legal resources available to Central American families seeking refuge in the US is a humanitarian crisis. Ryan said in a statement: \u201cThe Obama Administration is seriously misguided in its approach to this humanitarian crisis if it believes the solution is to round up refugee families at their schools, their churches and homes, in an effort appear tough on immigration.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
