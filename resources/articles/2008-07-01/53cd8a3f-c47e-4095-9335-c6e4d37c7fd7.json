Every day this week one of them will explain their choice, today Sir Geoff Hurst sings Bobby Moore's praises. Before the end of the week we will run a poll on this site so that you can vote for your favourite... Bobby Moore is the best player I ever played with. I played with him over a long period of time, 15 years with West Ham and six years with England, so I had a great opportunity to see him develop and we've not produced another English-born central defender who has come close to him. People might talk about Rio Ferdinand today but he's not in the same class as Bobby. Bobby's composure was second to none, something that he had as a kid. He never got uptight or under pressure, not even in the big games. In fact, in the big games you could guarantee that he would play even better. He lived for those games and he would nearly always be the best player on the field. He was fantastic in the World Cup final in 1966 and, arguably, played better in the World Cup in 1970, when we came up against Brazil, the best team in the world. Anyone wanting to watch a great player should get the video of that match and they will understand what I mean. The tackle on Jairzinho, when the Brazilian winger was running at him, is almost an iconic moment and there is the lovely photograph of Pel\u00e9, the greatest player I ever played against, with Bobby after the match. Pel\u00e9 had so much regard for Bobby as a defender because he knew what a fantastic player he was. Bobby was the obvious captain in an England team full of great characters. Bobby Charlton and Jimmy Greaves were hugely influential but it was almost automatic that, when Bobby got into the side, he would go on to be captain. He was not a ranter or a raver or a fist-pumping captain. If he didn't like what you did he would show some disdain by just giving you a sideward glance. And he wouldn't give great praise to players unless they absolutely earned it. Bobby wasn't blessed with great pace and people said that he wasn't particularly good in the air but nobody out-ran him and nobody out-jumped him. He was able to read the game at the back like nobody else. He also had an ability to pass with both feet from back to front, hence the last goal in the World Cup final in 1966. If you looked at the current England centre-halves, I would think 99% of the time they knock the ball sideways to the full-back but Bobby could pass brilliantly into the front players' feet. The interesting thing about Bobby was that he wasn't the greatest schoolboy player when he joined West Ham. There are great players, geniuses if you like, who are almost destined to be a star when they come out of a nappy. Bobby wasn't like that but he built on the great qualities that were the backbone of his career. He was determined and a great learner and I think his determination stood him in great stead in the last few years of his life. I'll give you an example of his determination. I can remember pre-season at West Ham, when there would be about 50 players all training, and we would finish off with a little exercise where you would lie on your back and lift both legs off the floor while keeping them straight. The last person to put their legs down would be the winner. Invariably Bobby would win or, if not, would be in the top two or three. He had that desire to want to be the best and, in my opinion, he was the best. The best of Bobby Moore on YouTube Watch Bobby Moore enter footballing legend at the 1966 World Cup...
