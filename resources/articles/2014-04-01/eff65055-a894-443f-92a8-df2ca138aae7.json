Video footage will show that Cecily McMillan \"crouched down, then bent her knees, and then aimed her elbow at the officer and then jumped up to strike\" the officer as he led her away from a protest in lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park in March 2012, Erin Choi, an assistant district attorney, told the jury in her opening argument in McMillan's trial for assault. \"'Are you filming this?', 'Are you filming this?' were the defendant's words right before she intentionally attacked Police Officer Grantley Bovell,\" said Choi. After receiving a blow to his left eye from McMillan's elbow, Choi said, \"Officer Bovell was completely horrified. This was the last thing he was expecting to happen that day.\" McMillan, 25, is accused of assaulting Bovell, 35, and attempting to stop him from performing his duties during an operation to clear the park on the night of 17 March, when hundreds of protesters had gathered to mark six months of the Occupy movement. McMillan, who denies the charge, faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. One of McMillan's attorneys, Rebecca Heinegg, told the court in her opening argument that McMillan did not intentionally strike Bovell but simply \u201creacted in surprise\u201d to being grabbed on her right breast. Heinegg said the trial would centre on \u201cwhat happened in a split-second on 17 March 2012, inside Cecily McMillan's head\u201d. Heinegg stressed that while McMillan was \u201ca committed activist\u201d involved in Occupy Wall Street, \u201cknown among other activists for her commitment to non-violence\u201d, she was on \u201ca day off from Occupy\u201d on 17 March 2012. \u201cShe was dressed in bright green, she had friends visiting from out of town, and she was out in the West Village and the East Village to celebrate St Patrick's Day,\u201d Heinegg said. McMillan had briefly stopped at the park to collect another friend, said Heinegg. \"As Cecily was walking out of the park, heading back to her friends, she was suddenly grabbed from behind and pulled up and back by Officer Bovell, grabbed on her right breast, grabbed so hard that it left a bruise in the shape of a hand-print. \u201cAs she reacted she hit Officer Bovell in the face with her elbow. She did not intend to hurt him, she certainly did not intend to prevent him from completing his police duties. She did not even know that the person grabbing her from behind was a police officer. She just reacted. And ladies and gentlemen, reacting to being grabbed by a stranger is not a crime\u201d. Choi, however, told the jury that after arriving at Zuccotti Park Bovell, of the 40th precinct in the Bronx, spotted McMillan \u201cshouting, yelling and cursing at a female officer\u201d after protesters were told by police that they must exit so that the park could be cleaned, and insisting that she did not have to leave. He \u201cdecided to escort her out of the park by placing his hand on the back of her right shoulder,\u201d Choi said. \u201cAs they walked, Officer Bovell's open palm was on the back of her shoulder,\u201d said Choi. \u201cThe defendant decided to turn to her left and say: 'Are you filming this?', 'Are you filming this?'. Officer Bovell, curious, turned to the left to find out who the defendant was talking to. At that moment, the defendant crouched down and jumped up and struck Officer Bovell.\u201d Choi claimed that when McMillan \u201cattempted to flee\u201d, Bovell \u201cfell on top of her\u201d and stood her upright so that she could be walked to a holding area where arrested protesters were being held. McMillan then said that she could not breathe and began \u201ckicking her legs to get away from the officer, laying on the ground and refusing to give the officer her hands so that she could be handcuffed\u201d. \u201cOfficer Bovell informed her that if she could talk she could breathe,\u201d said Choi. McMillan was placed on a bus to be processed. \u201cAs soon as she got on the bus, the defendant acted as if she was suffering from a seizure and could not breathe,\u201d Choi said, adding that McMillan was removed from the bus and began convulsing on the pavement. Choi told the jury Bovell suffered bruising, swelling and a cut under his left eye, and went on to suffer headaches and blurred vision. \u201cThat's how hard the defendant struck the officer,\u201d she said. Dr Eva Yan, an optometrist who examined Bovell two days later, testified that she recorded his iris as being slightly inflamed and that his cornea had a small scar. She said under cross-examination from Martin Stolar, McMillan's lead attorney, that the injuries probably would have been more serious if an elbow had been aimed directly at his eye. Wearing a purple dress, McMillan, an organiser and former New School student, sat between her attorneys taking notes as prosecutors made their arguments. A group of supporters and Occupy Wall Street organisers sat watching in the public benches. The trial is believed to be the last of a series of prosecutions brought by Manhattan authorities against the 2012 protesters. Choi acknowledged that questions would be raised by McMillan\u2019s attorneys about Bovell's past conduct. Previously, during jury selection, she told told jurors Bovell had been disciplined by police chiefs for having five parking and speeding tickets fixed by his union representative as part of the so-called \u201cBronx ticketing scandal\u201d that became public in 2011. The NYPD has also confirmed in court filings in the trial that Bovell was previously subject to at least two other inquiries by the internal affairs bureau, and was disciplined over a 2010 case in which a 17-year-old boy claimed to have been injured after being run off the road on his dirt bike by police. Bovell is also being sued in a civil lawsuit by an Occupy activist who claims the officer intentionally banged his head against the seats of a bus while removing him from the same protest on 17 March. Choi asked the jurors to instead \u201cfocus on what happened\u201d in the approach to McMillan striking Bovell in the face. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, is scheduled to resume at the state courthouse in Manhattan on Monday morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
