Anyway, best of luck to all the lads at Pablamos Cigars Espa\u00f1a tonight, as they bed in to their local bar to watch Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a give \"a good shafting to those high-board professional divers sometimes known as Juventus.\" Preamble The teams emerge from the tunnel. Chelsea are in blue with girlie white socks and VfB Stuttgart are in scralet red with white trim. They line up for the Champions League music and shake hands. Damien Duff starts his first game for 80 days, Scott Parker makes his Champions League debut Hernan Crespo looks set to play alone up front. Away goals count double up to 90 minutes. After that we're in to Silver Goal territory, which I will explain as soon as I figure out what it is. 1 min: VfB Stuttgart kick off and Scott Parker immediately concedes a free-kick about 10 yards outside the Chelsea box. Centre-back Marcelo Bordon whacks it over the bar. 2 mins: Lampard picks the ball up from Glen Johnson on the right wing and attempts to get an early cross in towards Hernan Crespo. It's cut out. The ball finds its way to Damien Duff on the left wing but his attempt at a cross is blocked and ends up going wide. Goal kick. 4 mins: Pompey old boy Boris Zivkovic is outrun down the left flank by Damien Duff. He pushes the Irish man and concedes a free-kick on the left corner of the Stuttgart box. Duff attempts to sneak his free-kick in at the near post, but Hildebrand the goalkeeper puts it out for a corner which Stuttgart clear. 7 mins: \"Wiil You Start On Time This Week?\" enquires Robin Buss, who in my opinion would be far better served learning how to spell simple four-letter words like 'will', instead of nit-picking about my normally impeccable time-keeping. 9 mins: Crespo releases Duff down the left flank, where Zivkovic upends him. The referee waves play on. Moments later, the VfB Stuttgart defence stands back to admire Duff as he crosses one in to Crespo at the far post. His header goes narrowly wide. Duff's presence is quite clearly causing the Stuttgart defenders no end of discomfort. 12 mins: In the Chelsea box, Silvio Meissner attempts to get on the end of a poorly delivered free-kick. He clatters into his own team-mate Cacau, hurts his head or neck and is helped off for treatment. 14 mins: Robin Buss is back again. \"All is forgiven, you're up and running,\" he/she/it says. Thanks for that Robin. Only for you and I'd never have realised what was going on. Alexander Gleb shoots from distance, but his low, hard shot doesn't particularly trouble Carlo Cudicini in the Chelsea goal. 19 mins: A poor defensive header from William Gallas in the heart of Chelsea's defence falls to Kevin Kuranyi outside the box. He has a pop, it's feeble and Cudicini gathers easily. 21 minutes: A neatly threaded through-ball from Scott Parker releases Damien Duff inside the Stuttgart penalty area. Hildebrand forces the Irishman out wide and then catches the ball as Duff attrempts to scoop it over his head from an acute angle, in an attempt to find Parker at the far post. 24 minutes: Frank Lampard tries a right-footed curler from just outside the Stuttgart penalty area. He doesn't connect properly and his effort trickles towards the goalkeeper v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y. 26 mins: Francis Lee writes: \"Do the man a favour and spell his name right: Alexander Hleb.\" Now I'm not sure if this is the same bloke who writes in every time I spell Alexander H-l-e-b's name Alexander G-l-e-b, the way the news wires have it, but if it is, I would like to ... ooh, hold on a minute - Glen Johnson is stretchered off with what looks like a torn hamstring and replaced by Marcel Desailly. 31 mins: Scott Parker clatters a Stuttgart player on the touchline - not the first meaty tackle the chippy former Charlton midfielder has put in tonight. Grrr! 33 mins: Stuttgart attack down the left courtesy of Meissner and Cacau. By the time I finish the sentence Chelsea have won possession back and are attacking themselves. But then, wouldn't you know that by the time that particular sentece gets its full-stop, Stuttgart are back in possession and launching another sortie into the Chelsea half. Ebb. Flow. Ebb. Flow. Etc. That's football. In fact football is what that is. 36 mins: A lovely piece of back-heelery from Damien Duff frees fat Frank Lampard down the left wing, but his attempt at a cross is cleared. The ball comes back to Duff, who attempts to turn Hinkel inside out again. But like that old crone Margaret Thatcher ... he's not for turning. 38 mins: Stuttgart try another one from distance. Zvonimir Soldo cracks one off from 25 yards (yeah, yeah, grow up), but a deflection takes the sting out of it and it doesn't cost Cudicini a second thought. VfB Stuttgart substitution: Imre Szabics for Cacau. 40 mins: Parker and Lampard combine to release Duff down the left flank again. Kuranyi and Zivkovic immediately converge on him, block his attempted cross and concede a corner, from which VfB break and Hleb/Gleb hits a bouncer towards Cudicini which goes narrowly wide. 45 minutes: Half-time. Chelsea retain one of the slimmer aggregate advantages possible and I decide not to explain why I didn't comment on any of the last five minutes. Suffice to say it involves a very long-winded email from Florian Klager about a German ad for ice cream featuring several VfB Stuttgart players. An ad which seems to be as amusing as you'd expect from the marketing boffins at a German ice-cream company. Half-time break 46 mins: And so to the second half. Chelsea's defence has been looking a bit shaky tonight having let VfB Stuttgart impose their game on them, it says on ITV2. At the moment there's not a lot in this and this tie could still go either way ... Brian. Chelsea kick off. VfB Stuttgart left-back Philipp Lahm picks up the ball in the Chelsea half, goes on a surging run and shoots through a crowded penalty area. His low drive is only inches wide of Carlo Cudicini's right-hand post. 47 mins: Lahmm chests down a beautiful cross-field ball from Zivkovic on the left wing and attacks Scott Parker. His attempt at a cross is thwarted and Chelsea clear. VfB are setting out their stall early in this second half. Attack! Attack! Attack! 48 mins: H-l-e-b v G-l-e-b spelling update from Francis Lee (26 mins) which I'll be astonished if anyone's even remotely interested in, but it'll take up space: \"It's probably because here in Germany (where he plays, after all), they transcribe his Belarussian name (Cyrylic alphabet, see) differently to English speakers. Which is also why Serb basketball players are spelled ... continues for five years. The author of this minute-by-minute report reserves the right to edit correspondence etc.. 51 mins: VfB Stuttgart may be a goal down on aggregate, but if I had to put money on the outcome of this tie I'd be backing the Germans. Their stereotypical teutonic efficiency and increasing confidence going forward means it looks to be only a matter of time before they score. Needless to say, as I typed all that Jesper Gronkjaer missed two half-chances. 54 mins: Hleb/Gleb shoots low from distance. His daisy-cutter goes about three feet wide. At some point, one of those Stuttgart shots from way out is going to go in. 56 mins: John Terry puts in a brilliant tackle on Imre Szabics on the edge of the Chelsea box, preventing the substitute from getting a cross in. Moments later, Desailly does well to cut out a fantastic through ball from Hleb/Gleb. Chelsea are in all sorts of bother in this second half. Can they hang on? 58 mins: \"Here's a one-liner for you, which you can use later in the evening if you please,\" writes Morten from Denmark, who also objected to me calling Frank Lampard fat. \"That Devil Duff is wreaking havoc at Stuttgart's left flank!\" Thanks for that Morten. As one-liners go, that's a real zinger. That must be the famed sense of humour for which you Danes are renowned throughout the English-speaking world! Chelsea substitution: Geremi for Parker. VfB Stuttgart substitution: Tiffert for Meissner. 63 mins: John Terry returns to the dancefloor after receiving treatment for a head injury. He looks decidedly groggy. Meanwhile just on the edge of the VfB Stuttgart box, Frank Lampard, (who is not fat) sidefoots a lame effort straight at Hildebrand in the VfB Stuttgart goal. He'd been teed up perfectly by Gronkjaer and should have blasted it. 65 mins: After being put through with a delightful dink from Hernan Crespo, Frank Lampard lifts the ball over Hildebrand and watches in horror as what should have been a sitter goes narrowly wide. Luckily, the linesman's flag was up so his blushes are spared. 68 mins: John Terry lets Tiffert squirm past him and unleash a piledriver which Cudicini does well to save. The VfB Stuttgart player is adjudged to have been offside so it wouldn't have counted anyway. A replay shows the linesman was incorrect to wave his flag. 69 mins: This interesting mail from Tony O'Brien, who I'm sure was as delighted as I was to see Ireland smite England in the rugby on Saturday: \"In Germany there is a brand of confectionary named Dickman,\" he says, tittering shamelessly like a 13-year-old. \"They are cylindrical chocolate log filled with cream. Not to put too fine a point on it they are rather phallic. Some years ago they ran a series of ads which featured young girls biting the top of said choc bar and licking the cream in a suggestive manner before looking directly at the camera and whispering: 'Aaaaaah ... Dickman'. I don't believe any footballers were involved.\" 73 mins: An attempted cross from Lampard to Crespo is cut out by Zivkovic. 74 mins: A terrific ball from Frank Lampard finds Crespo down the left wing. Despite support from Duff, they are repelled. A foul on Gronkjaer earns Chelsea a free-kick to the left of the box but Stuttgart clear. 76 mins: Stuttgart corner. Tiffert swings it in from the left and Zivkovic plants a completely free header straight at Cudicini in the Chelsea goal. The home side are hanging on, but only just. They've been completely outclassed by VfB Stuttgart for long periods of this second half. 78 mins: An excellent question from Sean Cronin in New York, who wants to put an end to the Gleb/Hleb nonsense: \"If Alexander scores, will it be a hoal?\" he asks. I'm not sure Sean, but it will definitely be a kick in the swingers for Chelsea. Chelsea go forward, but Makelele's hopeful punt is hacked clear by Zivkovic. VfB Stuttgart take off their right-back Andrea Hinkel and replace him with a 19-year-old striker whose name I didn't get. It's his first-team debut. Chelsea counter by replacing Damien Duff with Adrian Mutu. 82 mins: Chelsea win a free-kick to the left of the VfB Stuttgart box when Mario Gomez (the young sub who just came on) causes an obstruction/jostles him off the ball. Nowt comes of it after Gronkjaer over-eggs a big pass pudding. Or something. 85 mins: It's 'after you, sirs' all around as the Chelsea defenders stand by and watch Christian Tiffert advance ... advance ... advance ... and then ripple the side-netting with a scorcher of a shot from just outside the area. I thought it was in and so did he. Great effort. Terrible defending. Just wide. 86 mins: In the VfB Stuttgart goal, Hildebrand pulls off two outstanding saves to deny Adrian Mutu twice from close range. Moments later, a Jesper Gronkjaer shot rattles the near post and goes wide. Great stuff. 90 mins: Hildebrand hoofs a big welly upfield in a last desperate bid to salvage etc. etc. Chelsea win possession and attack through Mutu. He loses possession, Stuttgart attack and force the save from Cudicini. 90+2 mins: Gronkjaer win a free-kick on the right which Zivkovic swings into the box. It goes wide. Goal kick for Chelsea. 90+3 mins: Peep! Peep! Peep! Despite a shaky performance, Chelsea advance to the quarter-finals of the Champions League at the expense of a game VfB Stuttgart side. Teams ...
