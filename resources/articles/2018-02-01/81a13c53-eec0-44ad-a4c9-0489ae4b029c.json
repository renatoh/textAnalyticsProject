The 48-year-old actor, who was one of the charity\u2019s 16 ambassadors, said she was \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d withdrawing her support for the charity despite working with it for more than 20 years. On Twitter, Driver said: \u201cAll I can tell you about this awful revelation about Oxfam is that I am devastated. \u201cDevastated for the women who were used by people sent there to help them [and] devastated by the response of an organisation that I have been raising awareness for since I was 9 years old.\u201d The development came as the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, is to pledge \u00a35m in government funding to help protect vulnerable children across the globe. Mordaunt is set to announce the funding following a speech in Stockholm heavily criticising abuse in the aid sector on Wednesday. Driver had attended previously attended high-profile fundraising events for Oxfam in Los Angeles and New York, and travelled to Cambodia and Thailand for the Make Trade Fair campaign. Her profile on the charity\u2019s website said she had been a spokesperson on trade justice and making world trade rules work for developing nations. In a statement, Driver further explained her decision, saying she was \u201cnothing short of horrified\u201d by the allegations against Oxfam International. The statement continued: \u201cIn no uncertain terms do I plan to continue my support of this organisation or its leaders. And though it is unfortunate that after 20 years I am no longer able to advocate and defend through this specific framework, social and economic injustice is more globally prevalent than ever. \u201cI certainly will not let the abhorrent mistakes of a troubling organisation stop me or anyone else from working with good people in this space to support a population of human beings around the world that needs our help.\u201d In a statement, Oxfam said: \u201cMinnie Driver has been a devoted Oxfam supporter for many years, and we are grateful for her commitment to ending global poverty. \u201cHer decision to step down as an Oxfam Ambassador saddens us deeply, but we also understand and respect her choice. \u201cAs an organisation, we are ashamed by the actions of some of our staff and are more committed now than ever to learn from our mistakes and ensure we uphold the highest levels of safeguarding standards in our work around the world.\u201d On Wednesday representatives from international aid agencies and ministers from more than 20 countries will be present at the Agenda 2030 for Children: End Violence Solutions Summit when Mordaunt is expected to call the allegations about Oxfam staff \u201chorrifying\u201d. She will say: \u201cI know that everyone here today, and decent people across the international development sector, share my disgust at these appalling violations. And share my determination to lead a full, comprehensive and systematic response to them. \u201cThe sexual exploitation of vulnerable people, vulnerable children, is never acceptable. But when it is perpetrated by people in positions of power, people we entrust to help and protect, it rightly sickens and disgusts. And compels us to take action.\u201d She is also expected to say: \u201cUnless you safeguard everyone your organisation comes into contact with, including beneficiaries, staff and volunteers \u2013 we will not fund you. Unless you create a culture that prioritises the safety of vulnerable people and ensures victims and whistleblowers can come forward without fear \u2013 we will not work with you. And unless you report every serious incident or allegation, no matter how damaging to your reputation \u2013 we cannot be partners.\u201d She will add: \u201cSexual abuse and exploitation is an issue the entire development sector needs to confront.\u201d The \u00a35m from the aid budget will go to the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children \u2013 a network of governments, aid agencies, foundations and researchers working to stamp out child abuse across the globe. In 2016, the organisation pledged to work together to end \u201cviolence against children in every country, every community and every family\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
