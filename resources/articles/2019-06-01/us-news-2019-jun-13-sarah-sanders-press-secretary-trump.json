Few Trump aides have been so willing to so often step out in front of the world\u2019s media and defend him, no matter what he had done or said. In a press conference to mark her departure, Sanders said she will continue to be \u201cone of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda\u201d. Here were some key moments from her time in the White House: On allegations of Trump\u2019s sexual misconduct When asked by Jacqueline Alemany of CBS News in 2017 if the then 16 women who had accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment were lying, Sanders held the administration line. \u201cLast week, during a press conference in the Rose Garden, the president called these accusations \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d Alemany said. \u201cIs the official White House position that all of these women are lying?\u201d \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been clear on that from the beginning, and the president\u2019s spoken on it,\u201d Sanders responded before moving on. The Mueller report details Sanders\u2019 lying Sanders was caught lying in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. After Trump\u2019s firing of the FBI director James Comey, Sanders attempted to cast the decision in a positive light, saying she had heard from \u201ccountless members of the FBI\u201d that they had no confidence in him. But speaking under oath to Mueller\u2019s team she admitted that the sentiment \u201cwas not founded on anything\u201d. However, when asked about it after the lie emerged in the Mueller report, she lied once again, saying it was a slip of the tongue, before going on to blame Democrats. Sanders says Trump has never encouraged violence against anyone When a member of the US Coast Guard was arrested for plotting what appeared to be acts of terrorism against Democrats and journalists earlier this year, Sanders was asked whether or not the president\u2019s consistent framing of the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d had contributed to a dangerous environment. Sanders answered that the president hadn\u2019t \u201cdone anything but condemn violence against journalists or anyone else\u201d. The number of times Trump has called for violence, against protesters, alleged criminals and others, are numerous. Most notably, referencing Greg Gianforte\u2019s 2017 attack on a reporter, he said \u201cany guy who can do a body slam, he is my type!\u201d Defending Trump\u2019s sharing of videos from far-right British extremists \u201cWhether it\u2019s a real video, the threat is real,\u201d Sanders said in November of 2017. \u201cHis goal is to promote strong border security and strong national security.\u201d She was responding to questions about Trump\u2019s sharing of several videos from the far-right group Britain First meant to cast Muslims as violent, the authenticity of which were in doubt. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the nature of the video,\u201d she said. \u201cThe threat is real, what the president is talking about \u2013 the need for national security and military spending \u2013 those are very real things, there\u2019s nothing fake about that.\u201d Sanders is a press secretary who doesn\u2019t hold press briefings On the day of her announced departure, she had not held a press briefing \u2013 which were once regular occurrences \u2013 for 94 days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
