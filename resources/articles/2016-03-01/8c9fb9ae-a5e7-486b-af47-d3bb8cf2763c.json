One fan passed away and another was in a stable condition in hospital after they both suffered heart attacks at the Westfalenstadion. \u201cIn the name of Borussia Dortmund I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of those affected,\u201d Rauball said. \u201cOur thoughts are with them.\u201d Fans of both clubs fell silent when the news filtered through that the fan had died. Dortmund led 1-0 at the time through Marco Reus but, with football put into stark perspective, their Japanese midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who scored the second, did not celebrate, though his goal confirmed the three points for Dortmund. \u201cWe were informed pretty quickly in the stands of what had happened,\u201d Rauball said. \u201cFrom that moment on the game fell right into the background. I could no longer concentrate on it. The fans\u2019 reaction was spontaneous. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it. \u201cI can only pay a huge compliment to all of the fans for the way in which they expressed their sorrow and respect in this way, in a unified manner. I take my hat off to the Mainz fans who, without exception, joined us in mourning and stopped supporting their team. \u201cThe scarves held in the air when You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone was sung has my utmost respect. It shows how deeply rooted honour and respect of each other exists and can be expressed in such a short period of time, and I can only take my hat off to that.\u201d Most Bundesliga clubs immediately showed their solidarity and paid their tributes to the deceased in response to a Dortmund tweet. Dortmund\u2019s players lined up arm in arm in front of the Sudtribune as You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone enveloped the stadium following the final whistle. \u201cPrayers &amp; thoughts to the fan we sadly lost today at the stadium, as well as to our 2nd fan now at hospital,\u201d tweeted Henrikh Mkhitaryan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
