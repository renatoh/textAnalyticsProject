The AFP confirmed it executed two search warrants in Melbourne on Thursday night over allegations of unauthorised leaking of confidential National Broadband Network documents. It said NBN Co referred the matter to the AFP on 9 December, and the investigation has been ongoing since then. The AFP statement on Friday said the investigation had been undertaken \u201cindependent of government\u201d and that decisions regarding the raids were made \u201cby the AFP alone\u201d. The parliamentary offices of Labor senator Stephen Conroy in Melbourne and a house on Allan Street in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, which is believed to be the home of a staffer for Labor\u2019s communication spokesman, Jason Clare, were raided on Thursday night. It is also understood another Labor staffer is also named on the warrant. At least five plain clothes officers, in two separate cars, were waiting in the street outside the Brunswick address from 8pm. They knocked on the door within moments of four people, presumed to include the resident of the house, arriving at the property. By 11.30pm, 10 police officers, many pulling document suitcases, had entered the house. Two officers strung a sheet across an uncovered front window after television cameras captured them apparently conducting a search in that room. Seven of the officers emerged from cars that had been parked on the street for several hours. Both AFP officers and residents of the house have so far declined to comment. Fairfax Media has reported that up to 20 NBN Co employees are understood to have been interviewed by the AFP over the alleged leak. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the raids were an \u201can extraordinary development\u201d and relate to the time when the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was communications minister. Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said on Friday morning it was \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d that the AFP left one staffer\u2019s home just half an hour earlier. \u201cWhat that means is that it has been quite an extraordinary raid, over an extensive period of time, in extraordinary circumstances during an election campaign,\u201d he told the Nine Network. Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne said the government found out about the raids after they began. Pyne accused Labor of trying to politicise the AFP investigation. The idea that the AFP would time its raid on Senator Conroy\u2019s office and Labor staffers was \u201cnothing short of loopy\u201d, Pyne said. \u201cIf you are suggesting that the government has organised raids by the AFP against the Labor party, that is an extraordinary allegation,\u201d he said. Albanese hit back at claims Labor was politicising the issue, insisting he found out raids were happening during the footy. \u201cWhat we saw was the media notified in advance; in advance of the people themselves being notified.\u201d He said Turnbull was \u201cvery precious\u201d about what happened to NBN Co under his watch when he was communications minister. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull has to state exactly what his involvement in this is, given particularly that it relates to, frankly, facts that the public have a right to know about the National Broadband Network and the fact he has turned it into fraud-band.\u201d \u201cWe know that he was desperate to stop it getting out that the roll-out is way behind time,\u201d Albanese said. He said the timing of the raids was unprecedented and extraordinary, but insisted Senator Conroy and the two staffers had nothing to hide. He questioned why there weren\u2019t similar investigations into leaks of cabinet documents ahead of the 3 May budget. Pyne accused Labor of attacking the AFP instead of co-operating with the investigation and doing the right thing. \u201cThe truth is the government had nothing to do with it.\u201d He said there were investigations into cabinet leaks but refused to specify which ones, insisting referrals made to the AFP were a matter for police, not political parties. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the raids were \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cWe have never witnessed such an extraordinary action during a federal election campaign,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhat we also know is that there have been other serious leaks out of government \u2013 including relating to national security, defence and the federal budget \u2013 and none of them have resulted in federal police raids.\u201d Turnbull told reporters on Thursday evening it was a matter for the AFP. Labor frontbencher Tony Burke told ABC\u2019s 7.30 program that there were allegations \u201cfloating around\u201d about documents being leaked from NBN Co before the raids. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the leaks that came from the NBN caused immense damage, immense damage to Malcolm Turnbull when they showed the cost blowout of the NBN, the fact it was slower and going to be delayed,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe thing that I also know with this is during the life of this parliament, on 23 different occasions we\u2019ve asked about leaks from all parts of this government, right through to the national security committee of cabinet. \u201cThe night before the budget government staffers were handing out cabinet-in-confidence documents around the press gallery. I know how many of those inquiries have resulted in police raids. I don\u2019t know how many times they\u2019ve been referred to the AFP.\u201d The AFP said Thursday\u2019s raids in East Melbourne and Brunswick were part of a phased approach toward the investigation, with the next phase involving examination and analysis of material collected during the raids. \u201cThe federal government and opposition were appropriately notified and advised of operational activity regarding this matter after it commenced yesterday,\u201d it said. It said it received assistance from NBN Co, including interviews with employees as part of the raids. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
