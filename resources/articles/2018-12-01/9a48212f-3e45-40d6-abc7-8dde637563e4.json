He has more than anyone else. 15 - Maximum breaks of 147. 320 - Seconds to make the fastest maximum of all time, against Mick Price at the 1997 World Championship. 101 - Career finals (won 67 of them). 43 - Age O\u2019Sullivan turned on December 5. More from R O\u2019S: \u201cI played very well today and I was still having to convince myself to believe that I could win because that\u2019s how hard a match it felt.\u201d And here he is. O\u2019Sullivan wades into the crowd and selfie-seeking men crowd around him with their phones. He seems genuinely delighted, which seems an odd thing to remark upon for a player who\u2019s jus statistically become the most successful player of all time, but it\u2019s not always the case for him. O\u2019Sullivan lifts the trophy, and ticker tape falls from the ceiling. The trophy is presented by a bloke called Alan Algar, who works for sponsors Betway, who I was on a podcast with a couple of years ago. He\u2019s come a long way. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic...y\u2019know...it\u2019s amazing...y\u2019know.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan seems slightly lost for words. He regains his composure enough to say some very nice things about Allen - he says he\u2019d be amazed if Allen doesn\u2019t win the world title at some stage. O\u2019Sullivan pours water over his head. \u201cHopefully he pisses off to this breakaway tour,\u201d japes Allen. He doesn\u2019t get the century, but he does take the frame, the match, the title and the record. Frame 16: O\u2019Sullivan 9-6 Allen Teeth gritted, this is in the bag. Allen needs snookers.... O\u2019Sullivan 73-0 Allen Frame 16: O\u2019Sullivan 9-6 Allen This could be some hall of fame level fate-tempting, but everything is going bang in the middle for O\u2019Sullivan...O\u2019Sullivan 46-0 Allen Frame 16: O\u2019Sullivan 9-6 Allen O\u2019Sullivan has a look in his eye. In the time it\u2019s taken me to write this entry he\u2019s sent three reds and blacks away. Suspect this might be over in smart time. O\u2019Sullivan 24-0 Allen Game....on? Frame 15: O\u2019Sullivan 9-5 Allen Allen ekes out some skin-of-the-teeth positional shots and a couple of pots that \u2018wiped their feet\u2019 on the way in, but he\u2019s on for another fra...oh no! He misses a relatively straightforward red and O\u2019Sullivan is back at the table. He has half a pocket to aim at with a red, and makes a complete trousers of things. Allen was fortunate there, but he\u2019s well on the way to another frame now. O\u2019Sullivan 9-78 Allen Frame 15: O\u2019Sullivan 9-5 Allen Ooof, O\u2019Sullivan runs out of position and is left with a choice of a few reds, none of them ideal, but he opts for one to the middle right and misses. Having already cleared that brown from over the pocket, things are now opening up for Allen... O\u2019Sullivan 9-12 Allen Frame 15: O\u2019Sullivan 9-5 Allen O\u2019Sullivan sinks an extraordinary long red and somehow threads the white through the pack. Position is a struggle: he puts away the yellow, but after the next red the cue gets away from him a bit and ends up in the pack, snookering himself save for half the black. Instead he nominates the yellow off the top cushion...but misses, and Allen has a free ball. But he gets a kick! He turns away in disgust, and what\u2019s more, the brown covers the top left pocket. We could be here for a while in this frame. O\u2019Sullivan 4-4 Allen Well that\u2019s one down. O\u2019Sullivan didn\u2019t really have much interest in salvaging that frame and a couple of slapdash shots give Allen the chance to tidy up the rest. Which he does, with the minimum of fuss, finishing up on 144 thanks to that early foul. Frame 14: O\u2019Sullivan 9-4 Allen Ach, Allen is on for a 147 but tries to force the tenth red and it rattles the middle pocket. He\u2019s 76 ahead with 75 on the table - and O\u2019Sullivan only belatedly realises he only requires one snooker. The frame continues. O\u2019Sullivan 0-76 Allen Frame 14: O\u2019Sullivan 9-4 Allen Still, he\u2019s started that task quite well. An iffy safety is taken advantage of and Allen is four blacks in with the reds nicely positioned. O\u2019Sullivan 0-36 Allen Frame 14: O\u2019Sullivan 9-4 Allen I have no idea how you would psychologically approach a task like this, if you\u2019re Mark Allen: you require each of the remaining six frames to beat the greatest snooker player of all team, meaning you basically can\u2019t make a single mistake for about another two-and-a-half hours. And that\u2019s the best case scenario. Like pushing a bowling ball up a ten-mile, 45 degree hill with a toothpick. O\u2019Sullivan 0-4 Allen That is a significant kick in the pants for Mark Allen. From the verge of just three frames behind, he\u2019s now five back and O\u2019Sullivan is on the brink of his seventh UK Championship, and his 19th \u2018triple crown\u2019 (UKs, Masters and Worlds) title. That, in case you\u2019ve missed it, would be a record. Frame 13: O\u2019Sullivan 8-4 Allen O\u2019Sullivan is back. Superb stuff as he cleans up the reds and now has the colours to take him to within one frame of victory... O\u2019Sullivan 36-59 Allen Frame 13: O\u2019Sullivan 8-4 Allen Oh lord. Allen gets an unfortunate canon as he tries to gently develop a few reds - his break ends, but - accidentally or not - he sticks the black on the top cushion, and with a 58-point lead (after O\u2019Sullivan takes a red but no more) it will take some effort for O\u2019Sullivan to win the frame from here. O\u2019Sullivan 1-59 Allen Frame 13: O\u2019Sullivan 8-4 Allen Allen looked on for a big score, but ran out of position on a red, the black just stopping his path through. The sort of mistake he can\u2019t really afford, given the position he\u2019s in. But wait! Another slightly careless O\u2019Sullivan safety leaves a long red which Allen drops in, and he\u2019s back among the balls. O\u2019Sullivan 0-30 Allen Frame 13: O\u2019Sullivan 8-4 Allen O\u2019Sullivan misses a tricky long red, Allen misses a much easier long red, but O\u2019Sullivan opts for caution rather than going for another effort from downtown. But it doesn\u2019t work: his safety is nothing of the sort, leaving Allen with one more or less over the pocket and he doesn\u2019t ask twice before sinking it. O\u2019Sullivan 0-8 Allen Frame 13: O\u2019Sullivan 8-4 Allen We\u2019re saved a re-rack by a touching ball, as both men trade nudges into the pack. A blessed relief, and Allen plays a nice safety shot into baulk. O\u2019Sullivan 0-0 Allen The players are back out: this could be over in about half an hour, it could last deep into the night. Shots? Shots. Get them round this lot. And that\u2019s the mid-session interval: Allen really needed at least three of those frames and, while he scrapped nicely to take two, it surely won\u2019t be enough. There are potentially another seven frames left, and O\u2019Sullivan only requires two of them. A tricky long pink for O\u2019Sullivan...but he sends it down like a merciless judge. It takes plenty of work to clear the rest, but he manages it up to the yellow, which is more than enough. Frame 12: O\u2019Sullivan 7-4 Allen We are in a phase best described as \u2018attritional\u2019. Safeties, escapes, tucked up shots, slight mistakes...and the latest is taken advantage of, as Allen carelessly leaves a red on to the middle left pocket which O\u2019Sullivan sinks. O\u2019Sullivan 47-1 Allen Frame 12: O\u2019Sullivan 7-4 Allen Bang! Brilliant long pot by Allen isn\u2019t quite rewarded as it deserved, as it slipped just out of position on any colour. He tucks up behind the brown, O\u2019Sullivan swerves out of it but that was a superb shot by Allen. O\u2019Sullivan 46-1 Allen Frame 12: O\u2019Sullivan 7-4 Allen At least three times O\u2019Sullivan looks in some peril, but on each occasion he pulls out a perfect positional shot to wriggle out of it...and then misses an easy black off its spot! Possible he got a kick, it might have been because he was hitting down on the cue a little, but it does at least bring Allen back to the table. O\u2019Sullivan 46-0 Allen Frame 12: O\u2019Sullivan 7-4 Allen A mistake from an attempted Allen safety shot leaves O\u2019Sullivan a red from the baulk cushion into the middle, which he sinks beautifully, even landing perfectly on the black. O\u2019Sullivan 25-0 Allen Game on. Allen completes a very level-headed clearance, negotiating a couple of tricky spots around the pink, and we do seem to have a final on our hands now. Frame 11: O\u2019Sullivan 7-3 Allen Allen spends some time weighing up a three-ball plant, ultimately decides \u201cEff It\u201d and goes all out. And he\u2019s rewarded, finishing nicely on the blue and has a great chance to pull another frame back. O\u2019Sullivan 30-13 Allen Frame 11: O\u2019Sullivan 7-3 Allen Crikey. O\u2019Sullivan carelessly misses a straightforward red down the top cushion when looking set to fill his boots. These lapses are what Allen has to take advantage of. O\u2019Sullivan 30-0 Allen. Frame 11: O\u2019Sullivan 7-3 Allen Allen makes a mistake from his first shot after the break, trying to rest on the back of the pack but flicking a different red half-ball. It gives O\u2019Sullivan a decent chance of a big score, but his positioning is just a hair off from the first few pots... O\u2019Sullivan 22-0 Allen Allen looks in a bit of a jam as he misses a snooker from right on the baulk cushion, but at the second attempt makes the shot and gets a little luck as the ball rests in the jaw of the right baulk pocket. From there, he drops in a red and goes on to claim enough points for his first frame since the third, which was at 1.47pm this afternoon. Frame ten: O\u2019Sullivan 7-2 Allen Allen looks like he\u2019s trying to play at a quicker pace, like a football or rugby team flying into the oppo to try unsettling them or get something going. It\u2019s not especially fluent, and indeed his break ends as he tries to force in a pink, the white skips off the baize and he has to roll up to the pack. O\u2019Sullivan 0-56 Allen. Frame ten: O\u2019Sullivan 7-2 Allen Allen pounces all over an O\u2019Sullivan miss at the start of frame ten, and the balls are poised nicely for the underdog. Three reds, three blacks in, and he\u2019s looking pretty good. O\u2019Sullivan 0-24 Allen But Allen misses the red with little conviction, O\u2019Sullivan sinks the last two reds and despite missing the green on the way to clearing everything, Allen stays in his chair. First blood to O\u2019Sullivan. Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen O\u2019Sullivan has to work a bit with the remaining reds, runs slightly out of position on a brown and in turn on the penultimate red, misses the latter and lets Allen back in. O\u2019Sullivan 61-25 Allen Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen And again: this time Allen is unlucky as a long, ambitious red flaps between the jaws of top right, and leaves it right over top left. O\u2019Sullivan sinks that, then a black, and should probably clean up from here. O\u2019Sullivan 31-25 Allen Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen Ooof, Allen doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s cueing right. He goes for a relatively straightforward red down the left cushion, but it rattles the pocket and goes out. Luckily for him, he hasn\u2019t left anything of note on. O\u2019Sullivan 23-25 Allen Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen V unlucky for Allen - he goes for a plant to break up the pack - he pots the red and breaks up said pack perfectly, but leaves the cue hiding among those reds and only able to see the green. O\u2019Sullivan 22-25 Allen Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen Jinxed it: O\u2019Sullivan sticks 22 away in quicksmart time, but tries to get rid of that red on the top cushion, it flicks said cushion and leave the red over the pocket. Now the table looks good for Allen... Frame nine: O\u2019Sullivan 6-2 Allen Allen goes for a mid-long range red into the right corner, misses and leaves the white near the blue. O\u2019Sullivan sinks a red right into the middle of the other corner, and other than a red on the top cushion, things look nicely placed for a big ol\u2019 break. And we\u2019re away. O\u2019Sullivan - remember, leading 6-2 - breaks left-handed, the scamp. And here\u2019s Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan, music choice \u2018Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star\u2019 by naughty Manc rockers Oasis. Mark Allen is introduced into the arena, accompanied - naturally enough - by Gala\u2019s \u2018Freed From Desire\u2019. The old, comforting BBC intro music begins. Here it is in full. Fancy a spot of historical, pre-match reading? This, on what turned out to be the apex of Alex Higgins\u2019s career, is excellent. Has there ever been a more...apathetic is the wrong word, but ever been a champion sportsperson who gives the outward impression that they could take or leave being a champion, more than Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. Upon being asked how great it would be to surpass Steve Davis\u2019s mark if six UK Championships, O\u2019Sullivan noted that he would be \u201cover the moon\u201d, but also that if he didn\u2019t get it done this year, then there\u2019s always next year. It will take quite the comeback from Mark Allen to make him wait 12 months: O\u2019Sullivan goes into this evening session requiring four of the potential 11 frames to retain the title and bring his personal collection to seven. In a sense, it\u2019s probably this sort of match that has led to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s on again, off again relationship with snooker: he\u2019s on his way to winning the second-most prestigious title in the game, and he\u2019s barely broken metaphorical sweat. Still, if Allen takes a few early frames we could be in for a longer evening. Stick around to find out.
