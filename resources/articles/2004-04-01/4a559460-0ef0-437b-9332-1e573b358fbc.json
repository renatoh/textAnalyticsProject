In a speech to the annual convention of the Institute of Directors, Mr Brown assured business leaders that both he and the prime minister, Tony Blair, would \"put stability first, now and in the future\". He also said he would \"support our monetary authorities in the difficult choices they have to make, and entrenching, not relaxing, our fiscal discipline\". The markets will see the remarks as chancellor-speak for Mr Brown's support of the Bank of England when it raises interest rates, possibly as soon as next week, in order to dampen consumer demand and the housing market as economic growth picks up speed. The Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) - which has held interest rates at 4% for two months following a 0.25% rise in February - is expected to raise borrowing costs as part of its \"gradualist\" policy to cool the housing market and consumer demand. Those expectations were today strengthened when Marian Bell, a leading MPC dove, told the Financial Times interest rates needed to rise because the amount of spare capacity in the economy was shrinking, and inflation was rising. The independent Ernst &amp; Young Item Club this week warned that, with growth expected to reach 3.25% over the next two years, a potentially destabilising pre-election spending boom could result unless the Bank increased rates. In today's speech, Mr Brown reassured his audience that delivering economic stability was \"the first and most fundamental duty\" of government, and said it included keeping pay under control. \"I have made it clear to wage bargainers that it is vital we maintain our anti-inflation discipline and be fully competitive by both private sector and public sectors showing pay responsibility,\" he said. He also warned that the Conservatives would put stability at risk with plans for a public spending ceiling of 40% of GDP, describing it as a British version of the eurozone's stability and growth pact. Some have branded the pact a straitjacket on growth, and Mr Brown added: \"Nor will we make the mistake of applying a British version of the European stability and growth pact where insufficient attention was paid to the long term, to the economic cycle as a whole, to the needs of investment and to the long-term sustainability of debt as well as deficits.\" The chancellor's insistence on stability comes after international thinktanks expressed concerns about the dangers of rapidly-rising UK house prices. In its annual economic survey of Britain, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out that, between 1986 and 1989 (the years of the Lawson boom) \"real house prices rose by 50%, and then fell by 31% over the following four years\". The OECD noted: \"More recently, real house prices have risen 50% in the five years to 2002, and nominal house-price inflation in mid-2003 was running at an annualised rate of around 15%, having repeatedly exceeded the MPC's predictions of an imminent slowdown.\" Recent rates of house price inflation were \"unsustainable,\" it said, adding that \"a sharp slowdown in the growth rate of house prices, and especially an abrupt fall, would have a large effect on consumption\". Earlier, business leaders heard Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, say that double standards over pay and pensions between workers and executives were \"devastating\" for British industry. Mr Barber told the convention that \"unjustified\" pay packages continued to be awarded to company executives, and that corporate governance was not delivering the standards needed in industry. \"We continue to see pay and pensions packages for directors at levels that are simply not justifiable. At the same time, workers are being hammered by job losses and pensions cutbacks,\" he said. \"The damage to morale from such double standards can be devastating.\" Mr Barber said he wanted to see company trustees keeping up pressure for change, and not being \"bought off\" by the Confederation of British Industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
