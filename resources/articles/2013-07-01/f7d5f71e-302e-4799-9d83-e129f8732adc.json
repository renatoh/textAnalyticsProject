Both Berio's Sequenza III and Stockhausen's Piano Piece IX have been recorded relatively often, and it's the two framing works that prove more interesting. Berio's Four Popular Songs date to the beginning of his career as a composer in 1947. Theyare straightforward arrangements, but they signal the start of a lifelong fascination with folk music, which would generate some of Berio's greatest works. B\u00f6ttcher's refined sound doesn't have the earthy quality that the music requires, though, and it's better suited to the miniatures of Stockhausen's Tierkreis. In their instrumental form, the 12 zodiac pieces have become one of Stockhausen's most frequently performed works, but the version for voice and piano, with aphoristic texts by Stockhausen himself, is much less familiar. It's not great music, nor great poetry for that matter, but a worthwhile curiosity nonetheless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
