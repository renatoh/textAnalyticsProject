British officials concede that the UK does object to the African proposal to recognise centuries of slavery as a crime at a United Nations-sponsored conference on racism, xenophobia and similar injustices to be held in South Africa in September. But they say Britain is acting on legal advice, in agreement with the rest of Europe, and that the UK is prepared to call the slave trade a \"tragedy\". Slavery, and demands for compensation, will be at the forefront of a two-week meeting opening in Geneva today to settle the wording of documents to be used at a conference already beset by accusations of anti-semitism and attempts by some governments to block issues that reflect badly on their own countries. India is refusing to allow a debate on the caste system and Middle East nations want the meeting to denounce Israel as practising apartheid and genocide against Palestinians. But it is the question of slavery and reparations that threatens to dominate, and even destroy, September's conference amid the European refusal to concede that a crime was committed and American threats to pull funding if compensation is on the agenda. The controversy focuses on the wording of a paragraph drawn up at a meeting of African nations in January that asks the racism conference to: \"Affirm that the slave trade is a unique tragedy in the history of humanity, particularly against Africans - a crime against humanity which is unparalleled, not only in its abhorrent barbaric feature but also in terms of its enormous magnitude, its institutionalised nature, its transnational dimensions and especially its negation of the essence of the human nature of the victims.\" The director general of South Africa's foreign ministry, Sipho Pityana, said Britain was at the forefront of opposition to the proposed paragraph. \"Britain is leading this argument. It is saying that the slave trade was legal so it cannot be a crime. It is supported by other countries who are most responsible for slavery, like Spain and Portugal. The Scandinavian countries are with us,\" he said. Britain says the wording is unacceptable because international law cannot be applied retrospectively. \"It doesn't mean we are ignoring history,\" said one British official. \"We are not trying to devalue what happened. No one is doubting the barbarism of the slave trade. But the legal analysis is that you can't apply it retrospectively and it must be tested against the legal standards of the time. Customary international law at the time did not oppose slavery.\" Britain proposes a different wording that will \"affirm that slavery and the slave trade are an appalling tragedy in the history of humanity\". The Europeans are prepared to say slavery is a crime but only when applied to present- day trafficking in humans in countries such as Sudan. \"What the EU is ready to do in terms of language is to say if it occurs today it is a crime against humanity,\" the official said. British officials deny that the UK is leading opposition to recognising slavery as a crime. They say that although British diplomats in Geneva are the ones raising objections to the African proposal, they are at the talks as representatives of the entire EU. Mr Pityana accused Britain and its European allies of hypocrisy over what constitutes a crime against humanity. The United States is prepared to recognise all slavery as a crime against humanity, but wants to shift the focus from the transatlantic trade and match it with the centuries-long traffic in humans from east and central Africa by Arab slave dealers. But it objects to paying compensation, as does the UK. A British official said compensation for slavery or colonialism was out of the question. \"We are not to prepared to link the question of development aid with past history,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
