Having lost their last two games the Saints were in a bit of a slump and although they got back to winning ways against a Reds side lacking five of their first-choice backs, they are lacking the verve and panache that we have come to expect from them. St Helens took the lead after six minutes when Leon Pryce ploughed through the tackles of Andrew Brocklehurst and Stephen Myler, Jamie Lyon converting for a 6-0 lead. But Salford were in no mood to capitulate, defending stoutly and looking dangerous with ball in hand. Midway through the half Saints went further ahead when Keiron Cunningham tantalised the defence by running across the line threatening to offload before finally doing so to Lyon who plunged over from short range. However, the home side were having to work hard and far too often they spilled the ball in promising positions. Salford stuck to their task and were rewarded when Gareth Haggerty charged on to a pass from Malcolm Alker and proved unstoppable. Myler added the conversion and they remained four points behind at the interval. When St Helens struck in the second half it was again created by Cunningham. The hooker created doubt in the defence as he ran across the posts before slipping a pass out to enable Jon Wilkin to touchdown. Lyon's conversion put them 10 points ahead and suddenly the home side began to play with a lot more purpose. Three minutes later a high kick from Sean Long caused chaos in the Salford ranks and Paul Sculthorpe seized on the loose ball to score. Midway through the half Lyon ghosted past two defenders for another try and Gardner wrapped things up when he touched down a kick from Wilkin. Twelve of the St Helens squad will be involved in the Great Britain v New Zealand international on this ground on Tuesday although Francis Meli left the field on a stretcher eight minutes from time with what appeared to be a leg injury and must be a doubt for the Kiwis. Catalans Dragons defeated Harlequins RL 38-18 with two tries from Justin Murphy and seven goals by Stacey Jones. That took the Dragons level with Wakefield in the table - and one point behind Castleford and Harlequins - and was sweet revenge for their previous meeting at Twickenham in April that Harlequins won.
