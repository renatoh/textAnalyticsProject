Edward Moor had first gone out to India at the age of 11, soon learnt to speak several Indian languages, and became passionately interested in the cosmology and beliefs of the Hindus. Now, back in England with time on his hands and in an unfamiliar country he hardly remembered, Moor filled his time by gathering together and organising the artistic, anthropological and textual materials he had been collecting for many years on the deities and images of Hinduism. Five years later, in 1810, he finally published his masterwork, The Hindu Pantheon Written in the same style as other encyclopedias of the gods of the classical and near-eastern world that were then being published across Europe, such as John Bell's New Pantheon (1790), Moor's book was the most detailed and accurate attempt yet by any European scholar to collate and compare the textual and artistic material on Hinduism. As well as classifying the complex and elusive universe of the gods and godlings of India, The Hindu Pantheon was the first serious analysis in English of the everyday rites and practices of ordinary Hindus. Before Moor, British scholars in India had managed to write some quite amazing nonsense about the Hindus and their religious practices. Sir William Jones, the pioneering Sanskrit translator, correctly believed that the ancient language of the Brahmins was \"more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either\". Nonetheless, he also passionately believed that the Hindus were a lost tribe of Egypt. Others in Calcutta were equally sure that the Jains were confused descendants of the followers of Pythagoras, and that the three-faced Maheshamurti image of Shiva was somehow a strange Indian representation of the Christian Trinity. So Moor's work was not flawless. Yet, by and large, The Hindu Pantheon remains a remarkably encyclopedic and accurate guide to Indian mythology. It brought together almost everything that was then known by European intellectuals about the religion of the Hindus, and contained reliable descriptions, images and genealogies of some 2,000 of the major deities. Moor corrected, for example, the widespread belief that depictions of the half-man, half-woman Ardhanarishvara Shiva actually showed one-breasted classical \"Amazons\", as earlier travellers had whimsically thought. Although Moor's work remained in print for over a century, he is remembered today less for his scholarship than for the remarkable Indian paintings, miniatures and artworks he commissioned and collected as part of his research. These consisted of over 640 items of Hindu painting and sculpture, with a special emphasis on the varying iconographies of the different deities. Now, as part of the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of Indian independence, the British Museum is mounting a remarkable exhibition called Faith, Narrative and Desire: Masterpieces of Indian Painting in the British Museum. This shows part of the Moor bequest, as well as many other works from the museum's superb and rarely exhibited collection, concentrating particularly on the Hindu art commissioned from Indian painters by British patrons. The show is thus a timely tribute both to the breathtaking skill of the miniature painters who created the images and to the curiosity and passion of the early British patrons who commissioned them. The finest of the images on display is probably a remarkable Jaipur-school gouache bought by Moor in Pune, depicting Shiva and his consort, Parvati. The two divine lovers sit on a tiger skin draped over a terrace, just after sunset on a monsoon night. They lean back on lavishly embroidered bolsters as they enjoy the evening breeze, the edge of the clouds turning golden in the fading Himalayan light. Parvati affectionately touches Shiva on his chest; the latter's foot nuzzles his consort's knee. Yet amid the tender domestic intimacy lies the strangeness and paradox inherent in a god who is both devoted husband and turbulent cosmic dancer, at once the ascetic and the erotic. The skulls of Shiva's fallen enemies hang from his shoulders; a snake curls around his neck; the river Ganga spouts from his matted locks. The exquisite picture was a particular favourite of Moor, who wrote: \"I think it the most beautiful, highest finished thing I ever saw . . . painted with consummate skill.\" Nearby is another remarkable commission of the same period, showing Shiva in his form as the wild, fanged yogi Bhairava, riding upon a giant green parrot amid a shower of yellow amaltas. Facing it is the wonderful Month of Bhadon, part of a series of brightly coloured Barahmasa images that Moor commissioned, illustrating verses of Keshav Das on the different seasons and the emotions that are connected with them. The turbulence of the thunder of the monsoon mirrors the emotional upheaval of the lovers Radha and Krishna, who sit enraptured at the centre of the picture. On a rooftop chattri-pavilion above, Krishna's favourite bird, the peacock, displays his magnificent fan of tail feathers; below, three sporting elephants splash in the rain-swollen river. In images such as these, the seasons are used as metaphors for the emotions, and the scenery is the landscape of the imagination. Such images were painted not to be shown in a picture gallery or hung on a wall in the European fashion, but to be collected in folders and enjoyed with a group of friends on a terrace in the evening - much the same setting as Shiva is depicted sitting in. Nevertheless, the British Museum has made a remarkably good job of displaying these small but perfect pictures, with lighting carefully arranged to bring out the burnished gilt of the borders and the inlaid iridescent beetle wings and carapaces that are arranged to form the deities' necklaces and bracelets. Other paintings illustrating the seasons, from Bundi in southern Rajasthan and also shown in public for the very first time, hang nearby. At a time when British aristocrats were looting every classical antiquity they could lay their hands on across the Mediterranean, and shipping home much of their plunder to the British Museum, few East India Company officials showed any interest in the art of the Hindus. However, Moor was not the first British enthusiast to collect Hindu statuary. That honour goes to Charles \"Hindoo\" Stuart, a strange Irishman who, in the 1780s, travelled to India while still in his teens and seems to have been attracted to Hinduism almost immediately. Within a year of his arrival in Calcutta, he had adopted the practice - which he continued to his death - of walking every morning from his house to bathe in and worship the Ganges, according to Hindu custom. \"Incredible as it may sound,\" wrote one horrified officer, \"there is at this moment a British general in the Company's service, who observes all the customs of the Hindoos, makes offerings at their temples, carries about their idols with him, and is accompanied by fakirs who dress his food. He is not treated as a madman, but would not perhaps be misplaced if he had his idols, fakirs, bedas, and shasters, in some corner of Bedlam, removed from its more rational and unfortunate inmates.\" Stuart appears to have worshipped as well as admired the statues he collected. Certainly he is known to have commissioned and built an entire Hindu temple at Saugor, and he wrote an anonymous pamphlet called The Vindications of the Hindoos in which he tried to discourage European missionaries from attempting conversion, arguing that \"on the enlarged principles of moral reasoning, Hinduism little needs the meliorating hand of Christianity to render its votaries a sufficiently correct and moral people for all the useful purposes of a civilised society\". Stuart's military contemporaries never quite knew what to make of their general. One of his junior colonels, William Linnaeus Gardner, himself a British convert to Shia Islam, wrote how \"he regularly performs his pooja and avoids the sight of beef\". Later, Gardner noted that Stuart was planning to take a week off to bathe at the Kumbh Mela, where he was later seen sitting \"surrounded by a dozen naked faqueers who, joining their hands over his head, gave him Benediction . . . Every Hindoo he salutes with Jey Sittaramjee [Victory to Lord Ram and Queen Sita]\". Eccentric as he may have been, Stuart was a central figure in the history of the western appreciation of Indian art. His collection, which towards the end of his life he put on display to visitors in his house in Calcutta, now forms the core of the British Museum collection of Hindu statuary, known today as the Bridge Collection after a subsequent purchaser. It is without question the finest group of Hindu sculptures brought to Europe in this period. Appropriately enough, several of the finest masterpieces of Pala art from Stuart's collection line the stairs that lead up to the exhibition. About two decades before Stuart began collecting his first Hindu images, another Company official, Sir Elijah Impey, commissioned Mughal-trained miniaturists to paint his menagerie. It was the first recorded commission of Indian artists by a British patron, and remains one of the most successful. The three artists whom Impey summoned to his classical Calcutta palace were all from Patna, 200 miles up the Ganges. They had clearly been trained in the old Mughal techniques of miniature painting. But when they worked for the Impeys - using English watercolours on English paper, and taking English botanical still lives as their models - an extraordinary fusion of the two cultures' artistic impulses took place, a fusion that resulted in an entirely new type of painting, known today as the Company School. The brilliance and simplicity of the colours, the meticulous attention to detail, the gem-like highlights, the way the pictures seem to glow, all show the Company artists' Mughal training; the tentative washes of a memsahib's watercolour are a world away. Yet no artist working in a normal Mughal atelier would have placed their subjects detached from a landscape against a white background, or with flowers cut into a perfect, scientific cross-section, as is usual in Company botanical images. Two traditions met head on, and from that blinding impact an inspirational new fusion took place. In time, the Company style came to be used by British officials all over India to record many facets of Indian life, including the flora and fauna that came to fascinate the British. Its extreme precision meant that it quickly became recognised as the perfect medium for illustrations to the different schemes of classification that appealed to the Enlightenment minds within the Company. Soon officials were commissioning Indian and Mughal-trained artists to paint huge numbers of botanical specimens and exotic Indian animals; the different castes, trades and occupations of India; and the country's architectural monuments and deities. The exhibition includes an especially fine Company image from Patna of a roadside seller of clay images. An elegantly attired client is being offered a standing image by a sitting lady in a green sari and yellow blouse; behind, her half-naked husband, a potter, turns a bowl on a wheel. The client, however, is looking up at an image of Kali trampling on the recumbent Shiva. But it is Company images of the gods, of exactly the sort commissioned by Moor, that dominate Faith, Narrative and Desire. There are spectacular examples of a set of images of the gods of the Tamil country, recently acquired by the museum - Ganesha sitting straddled on a bandicoot; Shiva incarnate in a garlanded linga; Kama, the god of love, attempting, at Parvati's suggestion, to shoot a long-meditating Shiva with his arrow. Best of all, there is a wonderful image of a wooden temple chariot being drawn in a festival at the great temple of Sri Ranganatha at Srirangam. At the open window of the chariot, two bare-chested Brahmins attend on an image: one carries a tray of lamps and a bell, while the other throws petals over the holy image. This perhaps surprising early colonial interest in and respect for Hinduism was something that struck the Iranian traveller Mir Abdul Latif Shustari on his Indian tour in the early 19th century: \"Most remarkable is the way that the British take part in most of the festivals and ceremonies of both Muslims and Hindus, mixing with the people,\" he wrote. \"They pay great respect to accomplished scholars of whatever sect.\" Such intelligent interest in the beliefs of India did not last. By 1813, a change in the charter of the East India Company let loose a wave of evangelical missionaries on India. The act was pushed through parliament by William Wilberforce, who told MPs that \"the natives of India, and more particularly the Brahmins, were sunk into the most abject ignorance and vice\". Within a few years, the missionaries were beginning to change British perceptions of the Hindus. No longer were they inheritors of a body of sublime and ancient wisdom, but instead seen merely as \"poor benighted heathen\". The Rev R Ainslie was typical of the new breed of missionaries filling the cantonments, or military stations, of India during the 1830s. In British Idolatry in India, Ainslie wrote of his visit to Orissa: \"I have visited the Valley of Death! I have seen the Den of Darkness!\" The sermon goes on to describe the \"sinful and disgusting scenes\" Ainslie had witnessed, namely Company officials assisting the Hindus in their ceremonies: \"The cloths and mantles are furnished for the idol by British servants. The horrors are unutterable . . . Do not European gentlemen encourage these ceremonies, and make presents to the idol, and often fall down and worship?\" According to another outspoken evangelical, the Rev Alexander Thompson: \"Those who between 1790 and 1820 held the highest offices in India, were on the whole an irreligious body of men who approved of Hinduism much more than Christianity: some who hated Missions from their dread of sedition; others because their hearts 'seduced by fair idolatresses, had fallen to idols foul'.\" Such missionaries began ferociously to attack any British official who, like Moor or Stuart, studied or took a sympathetic interest in the religions of India. The British mind was closing, and the short period of Hinduphilia was soon over. The brief flourishing of Company School painting, the chief artistic product of that period, did not survive the great uprising of 1857. This one room of lovely images bears testament to the strenuous attempts of a group of men working in India between 1780 and 1830 to understand the religious images and symbols of a world their compatriots were about to seize, and then partially destroy. Today, as Britain struggles to forge a more equitable relationship with India on the anniversary of independence, this exhibition is an effective metaphor for a brief but important moment of British scholarly and artistic engagement with, and appreciation of, the arts and culture of south Asia. \u00b7 Faith, Narrative and Desire: Masterpieces of Indian Painting in the British Museum runs till November 11.
