The Getty Images archive in Canning Town, east London, holds 80m photographs and negatives, some of which are more than 100 years old and need careful preservation and protection to stop them quickly degrading. Matthew Butson, the archive\u2019s vice-president, said a mix of a small on-site team and the use of remote temperature and humidity controls were being used to protect the rare negatives and prints. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a commercial archive, we\u2019re looking after our cultural heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have remote controls to make sure the building has the correct temperature and humidity. Too much humidity is obviously bad for imagery; a lot of our negatives are glass and go back to the 19th century.\u201d He said only 1% of the 80m images were digitised and the archive\u2019s curatorial team would usually transfer between 30,000 and 40,000 images online a year, but the lockdown means just two staff members are allowed on site rather than the usual 30. The site is split into three main sections with an upper floor where temperatures are kept at 17C (62F), a ground floor that is about 13C and a cold store, which is kept at 3C to protect the most fragile materials. The archive has 7.5 miles of shelving, spans 24,000 sq ft and is the largest commercial photography archive in the world. \u201cYou\u2019re losing history if you don\u2019t look after this stuff,\u201d said Butson, who cited the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as an example of why images needed to be preserved. \u201cNo one was interested in old pictures of Corbyn until a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cHis unlikely rise to prominence meant there was a clamour for these old shots of him; same goes for Trump. You\u2019re always telling a different story. It\u2019s not reinvention, you\u2019re simply shedding more light on an event or topic or person.\u201d Butson said about 80% of Getty\u2019s archive work was driven by personalities becoming relevant again, such as a recent interest in the footballer Arthur Kinnaird because of the Netflix series about the formation of modern football, the English Game. There has also been a surge in interest for images of the film director Derek Jarman\u2019s house and garden in Dungeness, Kent, after a successful campaign was launched to save it for the public. As well as producing collections of topical historical photographs such as pictures from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, Butson and his team are constantly on the lookout for lighter imagery. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be bombarded with depressing imagery, we\u2019re looking to upload imagery that tells a happier story about our times since photography was invented 160 years ago,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
