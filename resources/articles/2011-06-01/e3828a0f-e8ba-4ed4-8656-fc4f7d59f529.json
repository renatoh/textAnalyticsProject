What they did with their fourth album, Stand!, wasn't rocket science \u2013 Sly Stone took the live excitement of the Stax Soul Revue, grafted on James Brown's completely functional, rhythm-as-a pure-state funk, and mixed in the heightened airs of psychedelia (the Family were from San Francisco, after all). It's just that no one else had thought of it, and no one else could have made it quite as tight and loose, as blessed and blithe spirited."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
