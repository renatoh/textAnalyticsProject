Which is to say he is perfectly cast in an imperfect Cyrano at the New Group, adapted by his wife, the director Erica Schmidt, with lyrics by Carin Besser and Matt Berninger and music by Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner of the National. The show follows, in more or less contemporary prose, the plot of Edmund de Rostand\u2019s 1897 verse drama about a cadet with an ungainly nose and an elegant epistolary style (Dinklage\u2019s own nose is unremarkable, but he was born with a form of dwarfism, so the jokes about his nose are a kind of displacement). He loves Roxanne (Jasmine Cephas Jones), a childhood friend, but she loves Christian (Blake Jenner), a hunky recruit who can barely master subject-verb agreement. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid it\u2019s shameful,\u201d Christian says. So Cyrano offers to write Roxanne\u2019s love letters for him. With his brains and Christian\u2019s bod, what could go wrong? Everything. At least this version admits that deceiving a woman \u2013 into love, bed, marriage \u2013 isn\u2019t noble or romantic. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s sleazy. Yet the adaptation often stumbles. It\u2019s never clear where or when we are. (The costumes by Tom Broecker borrow about 300 years of fashion.) Schmidt hasn\u2019t settled on a comfortable vernacular and doesn\u2019t try to replicate De Rostand\u2019s wit, so we hear about how brilliant characters are rather than experiencing it. The pacing sprints, then dawdles so that the cast, choreographed by Jeff and Rick Kuperman, can twirl or fling flour into the air. The show doesn\u2019t so much end as screech to a stop. The songs, gorgeously played, have a melancholy prettiness, but they typically do the same work, excavating an emotional moment for a character. These moments too often sound the same. Roxanne\u2019s I Want song says, \u201cI\u2019d give anything for someone to say / that they can\u2019t live without me and they\u2019ll be there forever.\u201d A few scenes later, Christian sings, \u201cI\u2019d give anything for someone to say to her / that she\u2019s all I can think about and I can\u2019t live without her.\u201d Maybe this is a way of suggesting that Roxanne and Christian are destined for each other, but that\u2019s not what the play argues, so it reads as a failure to write \u2013 musically and lyrically \u2013 to character. The songs fail to adjust for Dinklage\u2019s woodsmoke baritone, Jenner\u2019s bright tenor, and Cephas Jones\u2019s expressive alto half rose, half thorn. It\u2019s a problem that the most distinctive number, the battlefield anthem Wherever I Fall, is sung by three unnamed characters who never reappear. Still, if you are a Hamilton fan, it\u2019s fun to see Cephas Jones, the original Peggy (and the original Maria Reynolds), own so many solos. Jenner, a Glee graduate, isn\u2019t asked to do much, but he does it well, even delivering the line \u201cYour hair. It\u2019s light and curly like pasta.\u201d While the New Group often prioritizes star power in their casting, this is, even in an uneven adaptation, a beautiful marriage of actor and role, a chance for Dinklage to swank his anger, his swagger, his intellect and his gravitas, some sword work, too. If there\u2019s a love story at Cyrano\u2019s center, maybe this is it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
