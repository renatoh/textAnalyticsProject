This was a plain drubbing. The Scotland-Ireland partnership was not even on the shortlist of four contenders chosen in the morning from seven bidders. Disappointment had been expected, but not this ignominy. The people behind the Celtic proposal believed they were the equal of Austria and Switzerland in any technical evaluation, and had not imagined that so dim a view would be taken of any weaknesses. This was the first effort of Scotland and Ireland to land a major tournament and it smacked of a rookie enterprise. The initiative was rushed and hindered by an enforced compromise. Austria, who were involved in failed applications for the 1996 and 2004 European Championships, have had a 10-year education in the lobbying process. The Celtic bid, by contrast, was confirmed only 10 months ago. Its very nature was a setback to the Scottish Football Association. David Taylor, the SFA's chief executive, had intended a solo bid that would enjoy the advantage of a streamlined proposal over more cumbersome submissions. Better still, Henry McLeish, the first minister of the Scottish parliament, was passionate about the scheme. In November last year, however, he resigned, to be replaced by Jack McConnell. The outcome was a more guarded attitude from the Scottish Executive. It would support only a joint bid with Ireland and thus cut its financial exposure from \u00a3100m to \u00a370m. The saving was hardly spectacular considering that the spending would have taken place over the next six years and the tournament would have benefited the economy. The attitude of the relevant governments was a factor in Uefa's deliberations and the Celtic effort was surely handicapped in that regard. The Irish promised two suitable grounds, but Lansdowne Road needs a major refit, plans to build a stadium in Dublin are in doubt and, so far, the Gaelic Athletic Association has voted to allow only Gaelic games at Croke Park. That problem was glaring, but few had guessed that Uefa would be so concerned about the use of three Glasgow venues. Strathclyde police thought they could cope and, in any case, it was surely possible to draw up a schedule that did not put two games in the city on the same day. Uefa, though, seems to have had doubts and will also have worried about two hosts connected only by planes and ferries. But the defects in the Celtic bid were not apparent to its advocates, who were aghast at the outcome. \"We were astounded,\" said David Will, the Scot who is a Fifa vice-president and was a non-voting observer on the Uefa executive committee yesterday. And McConnell said puzzlingly: \"This is a bit like being 4-0 down at half-time, getting three goals in the second half, lots of pressure in the last 10 minutes and not quite getting there.\" It was more like a drubbing that traps a team in the relegation zone. Austria and Switzerland triumphed, seeing off the surprising challenge of the runners-up Hungary, with Greece/Turkey and the Nordic bid further behind. Russia, and Bosnia/Croatia, joined the Celtic grouping as also-rans. It is uncertain if another campaign will be fought by Taylor in the future, especially if the concentration of Glasgow grounds is really such an obstacle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
