They have been lending us a helping trunk for more than 5,000 years, as living tractors, pile drivers, fork-lift trucks and even tanks. But now they are learning how fickle their so-called mates can be. Trucks and cars have replaced them in transport, and heavy machinery in logging. As working elephants pick up their P45s, and human expansion pushes their wild cousins into ever smaller pockets of forest, their continued existence across south-east Asia is under threat. Adam Fowler finds out if anything can be done in Giant On Our Hands (11am, Radio 4). Elsewhere, the American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade is looking back over her life in Voices (4pm, Radio 3). Since her debut in The Magic Flute at the New York Met in 1970, she has enjoyed a glittering international career. She gained recognition as a bel canto specialist but is also admired for her performances in operas by Mozart and Strauss, as well as her finesse in the French repertoire. And she's no slouch when it comes to Broadway songs. These specialities are highlighted in the recordings she introduces: French songs by Debussy and Satie, operatic excerpts by Mozart, Massenet and Rossini, and songs by Richard Rodgers and Chris Brubeck."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
