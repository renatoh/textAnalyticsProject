Galilee Blockade organisers warn members of their network will occupy work sites, chain themselves to machinery and clog phone lines, among other actions that will cost Downer money until it exits a non-binding contract over the contentious Carmichael site . The protest group, which differentiates itself from a growing number of anti-Adani campaigns by vowing to engage in \u201cdirect action\u201d that will result in mass arrests, considers that the size and scope of Downer\u2019s operations make it especially vulnerable. It has compiled a 19-page dossier detailing 350 Downer sites that may be targeted, as part of an attempt to stop a mine that has mixed support among the Australian public but is backed by the federal and Queensland governments. Galilee Blockade, which claims it has more than 9,000 people who have volunteered for \u201clocal direct action\u201d, has already received legal warnings from Adani over its plans to infiltrate the miner\u2019s workforce with informants. \u201cThings we plan to do are illegal and we plan to get arrested over and over again because we\u2019re a civil resistance campaign,\u201d said the group\u2019s strategist, Ben Pennings. \u201cThis is not about sending Downer broke or any workers losing their jobs. We want this to be a very strong incentive for them not to follow through with their Adani contract. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the court cases [against the mine] win and we can all pack up and go home. Otherwise civil resistance is all we\u2019ve got left and we\u2019re convinced we\u2019re going to win because enough people care about it and we\u2019re big enough.\u201d The campaign group\u2019s pledge comes after the first arrests involving protests against Adani\u2019s mining plans in Queensland on Thursday. Demonstrators occupied the Brisbane headquarters of Aurizon, demanding it drop its bid for a $1.25bn commonwealth loan to build a rail line opening up coal exports from the Galilee basin. Five people, including \u201cGrandparents for the Galilee\u201d protesters John and Rae Sheridan, were charged with trespass. Pennings said Downer\u2019s pivotal role in the Adani project, which would range from mine drilling and blasting to loading and hauling coal and waste, was not widely known in the environment movement or among the broader public. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no idea when and where we\u2019re coming because they\u2019ve got hundreds and hundreds of sites. We could be in one state one week and another state another week.\u201d The group says it has surveilled 13 sites across three states so far and is appealing for more information from the public via a \u201cDob in Downer\u201d campaign. Pennings said the group believed it was \u201cvery likely\u201d Downer would succumb to pressure over the Adani contract, which would carry over five years according to letters of award signed in 2015. Adani has most of the government approvals it needs for the project but is due to make an investment decision next month. It is yet to announce whether it has secured finance for a project mooted to cost at least $16bn. Pennings said Downer, which also worked on roads, the national broadband network, water infrastructure and windfarms, \u201cdon\u2019t have to enter into this contract, they\u2019re doing fine without this contract\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s important because they can pull out easily. But they\u2019re crucial because if they pull out Adani\u2019s got to find another company of a similar size and speciality. A Downer spokesman said: \u201cWe decline to comment at this stage.\u201d Downer\u2019s chief executive, Grant Fenn, told Fairfax Media the company was \u201ca supporter\u201d of the Adani mine and any issues would be dealt with by Australian courts. When the letters of award were agreed Fenn hailed the contract as one of the argest of its type signed in Australia in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019re very much looking forward to working with Adani at the Carmichael Coal Mine, which is expected to become the largest thermal coal mine in Australia,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
