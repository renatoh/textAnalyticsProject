This is twilight, the \"violet hour\" of T S Eliot's The Wasteland, a special transition time when the sun is just hidden from view but still leaves a glow in the sky. As the sun sinks below the horizon, its last rays shine upwards like searchlights and illuminate the dust, gases, liquids and manmade particles floating around high in the atmosphere. This is what gives the glow and colours of the twilight skies, and some of the best colours come from volcanic dust floating high in the atmosphere after a major eruption. Twilight officially begins the moment when the upper edge of the Sun seems to coincide with the horizon, but there are actually three categories of twilight \u2013 civil, nautical and astronomical. Civil twilight ends when the centre of the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. This is when it is too dark to read outdoors, but just light enough to make out objects on the ground in good weather; artificial lights usually need to be switched on and the brightest stars become visible. \"Nautical twilight\" ends when the Sun's centre is 12 degrees below the horizon, when the stars can be distinguished and a distant horizon is no longer visible, except in moonlight. Finally, \"astronomical twilight\" ends when the Sun is below 18 degrees and marks the start of night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
