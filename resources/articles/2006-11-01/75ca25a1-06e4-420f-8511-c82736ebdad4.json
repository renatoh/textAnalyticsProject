In August 2004, after deciding he had insufficient cover for his family, Mr Elphick bought a standard 20-year term insurance policy that would pay out \u00a3500,000 on his death. \"I wanted more protection for my wife and two daughters,\" he says. \"So I did a search through online brokers until I found the best deal. This was from Norwich Union and cost me a premium of \u00a361.50 a month.\" Earlier this year Mr Elphick was alerted by a mailshot from discount broker Hargreaves Lansdown that he could possibly reduce his life cover costs by switching to a pension term policy. It explained that his premiums would then qualify for tax relief. As a 40% higher rate taxpayer, this looked appealing to him. \"At first the quotes Hargreaves Lansdown obtained weren't that competitive, even with the tax relief, because the gross premiums were so much higher than those on my existing policy. Then they came up with a quote from Lutine which was really worth taking,\" he says. Lutine is unusual in offering to match the gross premium on a customer's existing life policy. \"This means that a policyholder will be 22% better off at least, by virtue of basic rate tax relief, and ensures that they won't be worse off even if the tax relief were to disappear at some point in the future,\" explains Jon Briggs, protection research manager at Hargreaves Lansdown. So, in July this year, Mr Elphick switched to Lutine with a remaining term of 19 years and one month. At a gross monthly premium of \u00a361.50, he actually pays \u00a347.97 per month net of basic rate tax and, once he has claimed back a further 18% tax relief through his tax return, the true cost will be just \u00a336.90 per month. As a higher rate taxpayer, he stands to save \u00a35,633.40 over the term of the policy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
