As a Radio 4 documentary explained this week, like many local ballots in England's patchwork of parishes, this cathedral city contest to select an overseer to the poor slipped through the cracks in the national ban on women's votes. But legal loopholes were not the only thing keeping female politics alive \u2013 there were also women who openly flouted the spirit of these rules. The first was Lily Maxwell, a stern-looking widow, who ran \"a small shop selling crockery, red herring and suchlike\". Erroneously included on Manchester's roll in 1867, she made her way to the booth and did her bit. Her vote was eventually disallowed, but not before she'd made her point about sisters doing it for themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
