Jordan Vogt-Roberts's optimistically titled debut opened last month, but the Sundancey wish-fulfilment of its coming-of-age narrative didn't take hold with rain-clouded British viewers. Either that or Jeff Nichols's Mud had already filled the annual quota for woozy adolescent romanticism, complete with snake-related climax. Vogt-Roberts's film was blandly programmatic on the big screen, despite the puppyish appeal of its young leads, Nick Robinson and Gabriel Basso, as best friends fleeing their maddening parents to live wild in the Ohio woods. Well, mildly wild: the massive, Swiss Family Robinson-style shelter they build is pure fantasy, mystifyingly invisible to police search parties. But if token interjections of canned zaniness from a third-wheel buddy (Mois\u00e9s Arias) are a lingering irritation, the film's broad peppiness is softened and flattered on DVD \u2013 not for nothing are the best performances here by sitcom pros Megan Mullally (Will &amp; Grace) and Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) as flawed figures of authority. Offerman's droll crustiness is also reason enough to watch the endearing making-of featurette included on the DVD, which makes a point of underlining the film's midwestern breeding, even if its sensibility is hardly as non-Hollywood as it claims to be. Still, if the runaway nostalgia of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom was a little too art-directed for your liking, this cruder alternative will stave off autumn a little longer. It's certainly a sweeter vision of summer escape than Paradise: Love, the first and most formally arresting film in Ulrich Seidl's Paradise Trilogy (Soda Pictures, 18), at last available as a single box set after being trickled out to film festivals and arthouses over the past 18 months. As with Kieslowski's similarly timed and scaled Three Colours trilogy, the films, each with a different but related female protagonist, stand as individual entities but accumulate wit and resonance as a unit. Love is an exquisitely painful, sporadically riotous portrait of Teresa, a middle-aged Austrian sex tourist in Kenya; Faith rather dourly shifts focus to her fanatically Catholic sister and her inevitably unhappy marriage to an Egyptian Muslim; the unexpectedly warm Hope follows Teresa's pudgy daughter's trip to a spartan teenage fat farm, where the ensuing holiday antics are nearly as upsetting as Mum's. A kindly observer Seidl is not, but he does emerge from this draining, invigorating marathon of impolite sexuality and malleable morality as a bracing kind of humanist, wholly devoted to his characters' imperfections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
