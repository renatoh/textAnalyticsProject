But Abbott replied he had not \u201cheard anyone talking about the Sydney attack as some kind of justifiable response to something Australia might have done \u2026 and frankly anyone who does even think that is dead wrong\u201d. He said Monis was \u201ca deeply unstable person with a long history of violence and mental illness \u2026 someone who was way beyond any mainstream \u2026 and who has been rightly repudiated by all the mainstream of Australia\u201d. \u201cWhat I hope to see is a spirit of pluralism, a spirit of diversity \u2026 right around the Middle East people are coming to understand this Isil death cult has declared war on everyone, it is not picking sides, it is attacking everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess one of the encouraging things is there are less and less of people trying to explain and justify terrorism in the name of religion \u2026 whether it be in this country, whether it be in the Middle East whether it is on the subcontinent \u2026 Fewer and fewer people today are trying to justify, rationalise or explain terrorism ... because it is simply evil, it is simply wrong. \u201cThey claim to be acting in the name of God \u2026 but there is no serious religious leader who is defending this \u2026 and if you take the Isil death cult in the Middle East it has been roundly condemned by leading Sunni scholars \u2026 there has been fatwa after fatwa pronounced against it.\u201d Abbott said the government would investigate why Monis was not on a security watchlist, because he had been of interest to security agencies and NSW police, had been found guilty of many serious crimes and was clearly a \u201cvery, very unsavoury individual\u201d. \u201cThe system did not adequately deal with this individual, there is no doubt about that,\u201d he said, promising the answers would be contained in a \u201creport that will be out there for all to see\u201d. Echoing many conservative commentators, Uhlmann asked the prime minister: \u201cDon\u2019t Islamic leaders in the west have to have an honest conversation about what it means to their community that significant minorities within them support and sympathise with violent jihadism?\u201d But Abbott replied \u201cI think [the conversation] is being had all the time in these communities \u2026 all people are diminished when something like this takes place. Every Australian is obliged to adhere to the law \u2026 this mutual respect is at the heart of our society.\u201d Uhlmann went on, saying it was \u201cnot Islamophobic to notice that this is a religion that is resistant to criticism and scrutiny, that is utterly incapable of laughing at itself and when it is criticised the reaction often tends to be violent.\u201d Abbott replied: \u201cWell that is certainly a point of view, Chris, and I think that if you look at the history of Islam it has certainly been different from the history of Christianity but things are changing all the time and what I hope to see right around the world is a spirit of pluralism, a spirit of engagement, a sense that diversity \u2026 is a good thing and \u2026 right around the Middle East people are coming to understand this Isil death cult has declared war on everyone ... it is not picking sides, it is attacking everyone.\u201d Uhlmann continued with another observation that \u201cin a truly tolerant western society we would hope for a day when Islam is so integrated that it could be criticised in a way Catholicism is criticised\u201d. Abbott replied: \u201cWell certainly Christianity and Catholicism have been criticised uphill and down dale, and you and I are both very conscious of that \u2026 but we don\u2019t blame the pope for the IRA and we don\u2019t blame the Catholics living next door for the folly and madness of some people who may claim Christian motivations, we need to be similarly carefully and cautious in these other areas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
