Last September, Ministry of Justice officials said discussions would begin to end the lease on the 200-year-old prison, which opened in 1809 to hold Napoleonic prisoners of war. However a final closure decision could be some way off as the lease \u2013 which is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall \u2013 has a 10-year notice period. Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, says in his inspection report published on Friday: \"There is a notice period of 10 years and it is therefore quite possible that the prison will continue to operate for many years to come.\" He says that some certainty about Dartmoor's future, or even a minimum timeframe, would let staff know where they stood, facilitate decisions about capital investment and allow for effective planning for the needs of the population. During its long history as a hard-to-escape high security prison, Dartmoor has held such infamous criminals as the \"mad axeman\", Frank Mitchell, and the acid bath murderer, John Haigh. But a decade ago, in the face of a mounting list of urgent repairs, Dartmoor was converted to a category C training prison and now houses non-violent criminals with a majority of sex offenders within its 655-strong population. The critical chief inspector's report comes as MPs on the House of Commons public account committee criticised the Ministry of Justice's criteria for selecting prisons to close, saying that it had shut down some high performing jails. At the same time, the MPs raised concerns about two new large private prisons, saying their performance had been poor and disappointing since they opened. Hardwick says that Dartmoor now holds 263 sex offenders out of its 655 population, 134 of whom are in denial about their offences. Dartmoor was supposed to be preparation centre for sex offenders before they undertook treatment programmes at another west country jail, Channings Wood. But the A to Z motivational programme at Dartmoor was withdrawn as it was not seen as effective and no alternative provision has been made. \"A significant proportion of the sex offenders held at Dartmoor were judged to be in denial of their offences and there was no provision for them,\" said Hardwick. \"These men made no progress and so the number was increasing. An effective strategy and suitable programmes needed to be developed to address these men's offending behaviour.\" He said the uncertainty over the future of Dartmoor meant there was now a risk that staff and managers at the prison became paralysed by things over which they had little control \u2013 such as uncertainty over its future, the state of the buildings and its location \u2013 and that they became an excuse for not addressing the things they could change. The chief inspector said nevertheless there had been some improvements at Dartmoor, including better relationships between staff and prisoners, but more needed to be done. Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the national offender management service, which runs prisons and probation in England and Wales, said: \"The decision to give notice on the lease is part of our wider strategy to modernise the prison estate, but Dartmoor will continue to operate as a prison for a number of years yet, and we are therefore committed to support it developing the regime.\" \u2022 Ministry of Justice figures published on Thursday show that the number of deaths in custody reached a record 215 in 2013. The figures include 74 self-inflicted deaths, the highest level since 2007, and 123 from natural causes. The increase is likely to reflect the record prison population of 85,000 and the rapid growth in older prisoners, often jailed for sex offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
