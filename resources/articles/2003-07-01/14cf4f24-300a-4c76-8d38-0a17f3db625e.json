Which is why being called upon to take sides in a romantic split is like trying to choose between two football teams who are playing ridiculously badly. Both sides are flailing about all over the place. Their shorts are falling down, their boots have flown off. They're missing the ball, scoring own goals, whingeing and stropping when a decision goes against them. Sometimes they spend the whole game just lying face down on the pitch crying like babies until they are stretchered off. Despite all this, they still expect the crowds to turn out and cheer them on. And you do, because at times like this, you are the crowd. With your shoulder to cry on, your bottle of wine, your rallying cries and your words of wisdom, you're everything they've got. The trouble starts when they're not everything you've got. What if you are also friends with the other team, in this case the estranged lover? To loosely employ Mr Tebbit's cricket test, exactly who are you cheering for then? I started thinking about this when I read the news that Kate Moss had 'sacked' Jude Law as godparent to her daughter. No surprise there. Law is the estranged husband of Sadie Frost, who also happens to be Moss's 'bestie mate'. It is Moss's duty to stand by her friend, making clear to the world who she'll be drinking Sancerre with until three in the morning, raking obsessively through the dossiers every woman has on 'How I Was Always Right'. The very worst thing about break-ups is that you've already got your dossier together, you really know your stuff, but then the Break-Uppee has to complicate matters by producing their own dossier on you. Cue endless exhausting arguments with them trashing all your great points.The aftermath, however painful, has to be better simply because it's so one-sided. In these situations every best friend worth her salt acts like they're chuffing down wine and fags with the Mother Teresa of break-ups - if they play their part well their friend emerges feeling cleaner than Monday's laundry, and ready to face the world again in all her wronged martyred glory. Other times it's not so cut and dried. Every fool knows that the first golden rule of Other People's Break-Ups is that you don't say too much too quickly because, odds on, they'll be back together before the month is out. Mr Gone-Forever will be back for good and you'll be left desperately trying to claw back all those 'supportive' remarks. Believe me, I've been there, and there is no way of unsaying: 'I never liked him, he had shifty eyes, he came on to me you know.' Less well documented is the minefield that occurs when a couple you know, both of whom you like equally, are torn asunder. Relationships are like social spaghetti - you get to know their mates, they get to know your mates, and before you know it you're all mates. When they break up, your life turns into one of those split-screen scenes in movies - one showing you commiserating with the woman, the other with the man, saying dumb things like 'Oh you guys, I really hope you sort this out because I, erm, love you both.' As anyone who has ever broken up with anyone could tell you, this is very poor break-up etiquette. However even handed and fair you try to be, you just emerge as a latter-day Judas, smeared with the blood of innocent co-habiting mortgage sharers. Of course, some couples handle their break-ups wonderfully. Too wonderfully. I've witnessed break-ups where I've been more broken up about their break-up than they have. 'Don't you love me enough to give it another shot?' Then there are the ones who treat you like some sort of unpaid private detective. I once made the mistake of telling a slight acquaintance that I'd bumped into her recent-ex at a party. Fifty minutes later, I was still describing his clothes, his haircut, his basic demeanour (happy, sad, neutral?), the things he said (about her), how he said them, and of course anybody else (female) who was there, who he might have spoken to (slept with). That's what people, male and female, who have recently broken up do - they view your social life as one big ongoing surveillance mission with you as chief spy. It's sad, really. While it is said that misery likes company, it seems more true that break-up miseries needs information, information they can't get for themselves, and can't afford to be seen to want. Which is probably the most poignant aspect of standing on the sidelines of a raw and recent break-up. All too often, splitting a couple is like splitting the atom. You might not get a bang, but you nearly always get a whimper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
