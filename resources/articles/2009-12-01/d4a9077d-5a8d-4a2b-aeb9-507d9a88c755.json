It is a label that has followed Roberto Mancini throughout his career in Serie A. Mancini's flamboyant style as a player, as much as his 202 goals at club level, won him star status among adoring fans in a career that started at Bologna in 1981, included 15 seasons at Sampdoria until 1997 \u2013 alongside, among others, Gianluca Vialli \u2013 and ended in 2000 after three years at Lazio. His cavalier playing style, full of inventive flicks and daring goals, plus the blond-streaked hair, the tan and the stubble gave him more the air of an Australian surfer than a serious Serie A goalscorer. The glamorous image \u2013 he always appeared near the top of polls for \"Italy's best looking footballer\" and his website declares he is a \"Campione di Classe\", or Champion of Class \u2013 suggest a flamboyant character but those who know him describe him as \"a very closed person\", while his critics have called him arrogant and vain. Despite winning the coveted Serie A scudetto three times on the trot in his four seasons at Internazionale, his early reticence with the Italian media quickly degenerated into spikiness and culminated in a furious post-match slanging match on live television when he exchanged insults with a pundit who criticised Mancini's churlish monosyllabic responses. It was the astonishing outburst in March 2008, after seeing his lauded Inter side lose 3-0 on aggregate to Liverpool in the first knockout round of the Champions League, that sealed his fate as Inter's coach. \"I'm into the last two and a half months as my tenure as Inter coach,\" he announced to the media after the game. An enraged Massimo Moratti, Inter's billionaire owner, forced Mancini into a humiliating climbdown, and within 24hours the episode was, ludicrously, put down to post-match nerves and misunderstandings. The truth was that a rightly aggrieved Mancini had been tipped off about the feelers already going out to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and had opted to announce his own sacking in advance. Sure enough, later that month Moratti was spotted strolling out of a Paris restaurant with a certain unemployed Portuguese coach. At Inter, Mancini had brought back long-lost winning ways. After a third-place finish in 2005, the title came to Moratti's \"nerazzurri\" for the first time in 16 years, albeit awarded on the back of Juventus' relegation after the Calciopoli corruption scandal. Two more Serie A titles, won \"on the pitch\", followed in consecutive seasons. But Mancini was hoist by his own petard. The long drought at the club having been broken, owner Moratti's expectations rose accordingly and he yearned for success in Europe, something that has eluded Inter since 1965. Mancini's four-year contract worth \u20ac4m a year was extended by another four years. But repeated flops on the European stage \u2013 a mass brawl marred the exit at Valencia in 2007 then defeat to Liverpool in 2008 \u2013 meant Moratti opted to shell out \u20ac9m a season on his 14th Inter coach, Mourinho. That left a humiliated Mancini, for once abandoned by fortune's kiss, with four years left to run on his contract. The \u20ac16m wrangle, which meant Mancini was unemployable by any other club, was settled only seven weeks ago, with the coach reportedly settling for a \"measly\" \u20ac5m payoff. Mancini's earliest coaching experience was as assistant at Lazio to Sven-Goran Eriksson, from whom he has said he learnt \"how to pause and to think.\" Yet he was widely criticised for obtaining a dubious dispensation from the Italian authorities which permitted him to begin coaching before fulfilling the necessary coaching badges. Although a relative novice, Mancini's intense first three years of coaching packed in more drama than others experience in an entire career. Both Fiorentina and Lazio were footballing shipwrecks, sucked down by financial crises besetting the corporate conglomerates that owned them. A remarkable swirl of events at Fiorentina included a dawn police raid on the Florentine mansion of corrupt owner Alessandro Cecchi Gori. The portly club president was hauled out of bed with his actress girlfriend, 25 years his junior, still in her babydoll nightclothes. After 10 turbulent months Mancini \u2013 working unpaid and receiving death threats \u2013 finally bailed out. His sole experience of football in England came in 2001 when Eriksson persuaded Peter Taylor to take the ageing, if still immensely gifted, former Italy striker on loan from Lazio at Leicester City, then in the Premier League. \"The lads stood there open-mouthed when Roberto started bending free-kicks in from all over the place in training,\" recalled Taylor. \"They quickly starting calling him 'The Legend'.\" Mancini soon returned home and embarked on a coaching career that led to him becoming Inter's most successful coach in 30 years. Keen on working in England, he threw his hat into the managerial ring when Roy Keane parted with Sunderland last December but the Wearside's club's far from ungenerous board were deterred by the Italian's salary demands. Following Ricky Sbragia's resignation the Sunderland job again became vacant last summer and, again, Mancini's \"people\" claimed it was in his grasp even as Steve Bruce finalised his move to the Stadium of Light. Although the man himself was careful to keep his own cousel, Mancini's media contacts ensured his name regularly appeared on the back pages while he sat back and waited for another attractive opening to materialise. If he is to succeed in stepping out from 18 long months of unemployment to transform Manchester City into Champions League material in six months, then the 45-year-old from Jesi, on Italy's Adriatic coast, he will certainly need to be once again \"kissed by good fortune\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
