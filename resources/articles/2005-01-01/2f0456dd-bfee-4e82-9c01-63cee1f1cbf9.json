Like-for-like sales for the past 12 weeks showed an increase of 0.9% on a year earlier, compared with a decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter. The progress was offset by costs such as utility bills, wages and repairs, remaining higher than in previous years. The company, which has more than 600 sites, said: \"The pub market remains competitive with continued pressure on both retail prices and costs.\" It said it expected profits for its financial year to be in line with market expectations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
