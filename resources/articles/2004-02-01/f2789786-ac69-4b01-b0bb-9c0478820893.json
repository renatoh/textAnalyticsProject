Mr Liu, the hotel tout, could probably have picked me out from orbit, but he saw me from a mere 70m away. As he fought his way through the crowd to get to me I was glad someone else could do the talking and thinking while I tried to wake up after a night on a freezing sleeper train. Mr Liu could certainly talk. I'd received mixed reports about Xi'an. Everything I'd read said it was fantastic, while everything I'd heard said it was a disappointment. As Mr Liu pulled me free of the crowd, the first sight that greeted me was the massive northern gate in the city's Ming Dynasty walls. I decided straight away to ignore everything I'd heard. Just as at Pingyao, the locals felt that the walls needed a certain little extra something. Fortunately the colourful dragons looked much better than Pingyao's giant Donald Duck. With Mr Liu in full flow we reached the first hotel. My rejection of an underground windowless box, complete with two chain-smoking Korean students, lead to a frenzy of jabbering and another hotel. Finally we found a room and as dawn broke I decided to go sightseeing. Xi'an has its share of ugly skyscrapers and developments that blight so many cities in China but, either through accident or design, much of the city's character has been preserved. Above the ancient Bell Tower, at the heart of the city, the skies were filled with kites in the shape of birds, butterflies, dragons and, er, fighter planes. Making my way through the small park which served as air traffic control, I plunged into the warren of alleyways around the Great Mosque which makes up Xi'an's Muslim quarter. Islam had travelled along the Silk Road to Xi'an from the west. Unfortunately the ability to grow a decent Muslim beard hadn't come with it. Outside the tranquil grounds of the mosque the streets buzzed with food stalls selling delicious snacks. On the advice of a Netjetters reader named Jo, I tried the fabulously volcanic fried chilli bread. My own food experiments were a bit more hit and miss with great kebabs and dumplings, followed by strange stringy sweets that looked like a powdered local goatee and tasted of straw. I foolishly smiled at the stall holder who happily gave me some more. Xi'an's number one attraction (officially) are the Terracotta Warriors, just outside the city, near the town of Lintong. Not satisfied with having just the eighth wonder of the world on their doorstep, the authorities have built a pyramid and a sphinx on the road to the warriors which houses \"The Hell of the Wonders of the World\". It's either a typical example of \"Chinglish\" or a very accurate description of the excesses of the Chinese tourist industry. Massive billboards announced questionable slogans such as \"Traffic Brings a Brighter Environment\" next to a picture of a traffic jam surrounded by flowers. One proudly announced: \"Lintong Peasants Speak Special Foreign Languages.\" When I arrived at the Terracotta Warriors I found a large number of the good-natured local peasants manning a sea of souvenir stalls. They did indeed know a few words in foreign languages and with the sound of \"Hello! Hello! Just Look! Terracotta Warrior good price!\" still ringing in my ears, I made my way into the burial pits. Inside, I came face to face with ranks of figures looking no less determined than the souvenir sellers outside. Only a small fraction of the 2,000-year-old army has been uncovered but it's still an amazing sight. Unfortunately you have to go and see the four warriors at the Shaanxi Museum in Xi'an to get close enough to really appreciate the individual faces of the soldiers... or you could always by a souvenir statue I suppose. Back in Xi'an, the whole city had taken leave of its senses for the New Year lantern festival. The night sky was lit up with thousands of fireworks and the streets shook with thunderous explosions to the background drone of ambulance sirens. Red firecracker paper lay on the roads like snow along with one fortunately unhurt and smiling cyclist who had been blasted off his bike by a stray missile. I watched another rocket tip over and take off down the street towards a night market before exploding in a shower of red sparks. China's first astronaut must have been a very brave man indeed. I was relieved to make it back to my hotel. The following morning, having had no sleep, I headed east down the Yellow River, these days a rather disappointing grey brown colour. In the comparative safety of Luoyang, the peaceful night was disturbed only by the odd detonation and the electric Big Ben chimes from the train station clock. There was no sound of ambulance sirens but perhaps the residents of Luoyang are more careful or perhaps they don't have an ambulance service. What Luoyang definitely does have are the Dragon Gate Buddhist Caves built 1,500 years ago by the same Wei Dynasty who built the caves in Datong. Lacking coal and Datong's town planner, the Dragon Gate Caves don't have to share their stunning valley with a mine and industrial complex. Unfortunately the caves have not been spared the plundering of Victorian archeologists or the vandalism of the Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. Luckily plenty remains, including some enormous statues whose heads were clearly too large to hack off. Chinese TV is dominated by a disturbing mixture of army karaoke shows, weird historical dramas and French league football. However no evening's entertainment is complete without a kung fu film. They also appear to be obligatory on any bus journey over five minutes long. The bus taking me south into the Song Mountains towards the Shaolin Temple was no exception. As I watched the hero of the film demolish several opponents and a Hong Kong shopping centre with a series of earth-shattering kicks and punches, I began to have second thoughts about visiting the birthplace of Chinese martial arts. It was getting dark by the time I reached the temple, located at the foot of spectacular Song Shan, the central holy mountain of Taoism. All over the hillside were children in identical red tracksuit tops talking, eating noodles and trying to kick each other in the head. Feeling very much like the new kid in school, I walked over to the grim academy building which looked like it couldn't take much more punishment from the students. The whirling of numchucks and swords paused, only briefly, as all eyes followed me across the square to the reception. I decided it wasn't safe in the dark with all those mini trained killers and opted to walk to the temple in the morning. I was woken at dawn by a bugle blaring over the Tannoy system. Within minutes the sound of feet and fists flying through the air was drifting up to my window. The courtyard outside was filled with tiny assassins cartwheeling, summersaulting and destroying imaginary shopping centres. I decided to drop my initial plan of actually getting involved and decided just to watch from a safe distance. OK! OK! So I chickened out! Those five-year-olds looked really mean! I walked down to the beautiful Shaolin Temple and bought perhaps the largest ticket in the Chinese tourist industry. I was alarmed by the offer of an optional extra insurance policy unsure whether I would be attacked by monks or strain myself carrying the ticket. I ventured nervously inside. In contrast to the din of students training on the hillside, the temple was calm and serene in the early morning light. I'd decided the monks were quite harmless by the time I reached the temple's main martial arts practice hall. The large dents worn in the brick floor from centuries of training warned me not to underestimate the monks and that the insurance might have been a good idea. Back down in the Yellow River Valley a few kung fu moves would have come in handy at the Zhengzhou bus station. With the help of the station staff who took pity on the pathetic foreigner, I fought my way through the heaving crowd and onto the night bus to Shanghai. As the bus pulled out of the station and the driver got acquainted with the deafening air horn that he blasted all the way to Shanghai, a kung fu film started up on the screen. As another piece of the Hong Kong skyline was kicked to smithereens, I decided that this was the safest way to watch Chinese martial arts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
