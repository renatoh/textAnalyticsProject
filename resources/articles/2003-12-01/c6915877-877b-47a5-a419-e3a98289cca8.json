The US special envoy, James Baker, described his talks today with President Chirac as \"very fruitful\". \"We are agreed it is important to reduce [Iraqi] debt within the Paris Club - if possible in the year 2004,\" Mr Baker said following their meeting in Paris. However, the former US secretary of state, appointed by George Bush to lobby for Iraqi debt relief measures from European states, faced tougher negotiations when he went to Germany to discuss the issue with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Iraq owes some $40bn (\u00a322.8bn) to the US, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and others in the 19-nation Paris Club. Other countries and private creditors are owed at least another $80bn. The US hopes that a significant portion of this debt can be written off, speeding reconstruction efforts in Iraq. But ahead of Mr Baker's European tour, the Bush administration angered countries including France, Germany and Russia when it announced that those who opposed the US-led war in Iraq would be excluded from bidding for private reconstruction contracts there. Germany's defence minister, Peter Struck, today expressed hope that Mr Baker's visit would \"lead the US administration to change its position on the awarding of contracts in Iraq,\" his spokesman, Norbert Bicher said. \"James Baker can expect no success on the debt issue if the United States doesn't give in on the contracts,\" Germany's development aid minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, told Der Spiegel magazine this week. However, the German chancellor signalled a softer line as he went into the meeting with Mr Baker in Berlin today. \"Germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help with the reconstruction of a democratic and stable Iraq,\" Mr Schr\u00f6der said. \"That will be the topic of our talks. I think we will be able to agree within the foreseeable future.\" Mr Baker's trip to lobby for Iraqi debt relief from some of the staunchest anti-war countries - Germany, France and Russia - was announced just as the contracts exclusion was announced by the Pentagon last week. Mr Schr\u00f6der has said he is open to forgiving some of Iraq's debt, totalling $5.4bn, and the German foreign ministry today said the offer still stands. \"The German government is ready to discuss debt restructuring and, to a small degree, debt forgiveness,\" Karsten Voigt, a senior German foreign ministry official, told The Associated Press. However, with critics in Germany questioning the need for massive debt relief given Iraq's oil wealth, Mr Voigt said he found it \"hard to explain\" that the US was now pressing Iraq's creditors for help. \"Before the war, the US government always said that reconstruction would finance itself,\" he said. Russia, which is owed $8bn by Iraq, made clear after learning of the Pentagon contracts ban that it had no intention of writing off debt. The EU has said it plans to investigate the legality of the ban, and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, called it \"not unifying\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
