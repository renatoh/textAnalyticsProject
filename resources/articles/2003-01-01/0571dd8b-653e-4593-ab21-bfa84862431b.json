All are good skiers but my brother and I have knees that cannot stand up to too many black runs/off piste any more. My wife fancies cross-country. Where should we go? We seek good snow, a good range of pistes and lifts, reasonable weather and good-value catered chalets. We are not enthusiastic about long aggressive queues at ski lifts, nor long bus/train journeys from the airport. The younger element will certainly want lots of 'hot' activity in the evenings. Chris Oxley Konrad Bartelski answers: The best way to try and ensure that all your specific requirements will be met is to speak directly with a specialist ski travel agent. There are a number of small companies set up by skiers with years of experience in the travel industry and who have themselves skied in most of the best resorts. To come up with some options that meet your specific guidelines, I had to solicit some extra help from a friend, Earl Knudsen, who runs one of those agencies, Alpine Answers (020-8871 4656, alpineanswers.co.uk). This is what we came up with: first of all, should you want to go for 10 days over that period, you would find that chalets for that time frame are only available in North America. In Europe, they are available for either seven- or 14-day bookings. Should a week in Europe appeal, then it would be worth considering resorts such as Alpe d'Huez or Serre Chevalier, where chalets would work out at around \u00a3600pp, including flights, transfers and chalet board. St Anton is another option, costing around \u00a3720pp. However, if space and freedom are prime requisites, then you should consider somewhere like Steamboat Springs or Breckenridge in Colorado where the skiing experience is made easier by the high level of service and the quality of the customer care. A departure for Christmas on December 18 this year for 10 days would work out about \u00a31,000pp including flights, transfers and chalet board. But beware of the extra cost of the lift passes in America. You can also get good advice from Ski Solutions (020-7471 7700 for chalet information, 020-7471 7777 for hotels, ski-solutions.co.uk). \u00b7 If you have any skiing or snowboarding questions, write to Ask the experts, Guardian Travel, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email ask.the.experts@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
