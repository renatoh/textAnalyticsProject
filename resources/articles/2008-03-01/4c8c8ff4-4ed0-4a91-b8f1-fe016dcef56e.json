The Time Warner owned internet company aims to use social networking website Bebo to underpin the growth of its advertising operation Platform A and ramp up the share of online ad revenue it can take in the battle with rivals such as Yahoo, Google, Microsoft and News Corporation. \"In terms of its competitors AOL was starting to look like it had missed the wave in terms of agreements and acquisition in the hot social networking space,\" said Eden Zoller, a principal analyst at Ovum. \"Bebo makes a lot of sense in that respect and AOL has been trying to bolster its position in advertising.\" Some analysts questioned the price paid for Bebo - $850m for around 22 million monthly unique users worldwide according to comScore - given that it is tiny compared with MySpace's 109 million and Facebook's 100 million global users. The Bebo acquisition is being viewed by analysts as an international play, as Platform A is already strong in the US and it needs to drive the development of its business in foreign territories. As part of AOL's reinvention from subscription-model to ad-funded business it has launched around 17 international websites in the last year and plans to have portals in 30 territories by the end of 2008. \"This is basically an international move, rather than a domestic US one,\" said Arash Amel, a senior analyst at Screen Digest. \"Bebo is past its prime in terms of growth in the US - its growth is coming from international markets.\" Bebo's heartland is the UK, with around half of its global traffic coming from the birthplace of co-founder Michael Birch. AOL's $850m takeover dwarfs the \u00a3170m paid by ITV for Friends Reunited or the \u00a3140m CBS stumped up for Last.fm, two other UK internet companies. In a conference call today , senior executives from both AOL and Bebo skirted questions about plans to ramp up the social networking site's US presence with any significant capital commitment. Bebo, which is strong in markets such as the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, has ambitious expansion plans of its own. The Bebo president, Joanna Shields, said today that Europe was \"very much the focus\", with plans to launch local sites in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands in the next five to six months. Some analysts questioned the scope for revenue growth at Bebo, which as a private company has not revealed a great deal about its financial performance, beyond saying it is profitable. This is a question that hangs over many social networking operations, Facebook included. \"The historic problem is that social networking websites are high on usage but the ad rates are terrible,\" said Dan Cryan, an analyst at Screen Digest. Cryan's Screen Digest colleague Amel pointed out that Bebo's much-vaunted move into online video deals with broadcasters through its open media platform is not likely to be a massive revenue generator. He said that because Bebo does not own its own video platform it is only able to generate revenue from lower value ad inventory around video, such as banners. Content owners such as TV companies and the video platform providers take much of the rest. And Bebo's deals with Yahoo, for search and display advertising, and Microsoft, for instant messaging, are now uncertain under AOL ownership. When the deal is closed and sealed - AOL estimates this will take around 30 days - it is, of course, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg who will potentially be rubbing his hands in glee. \"Facebook must be thinking 'wow - if Bebo is one-fifth the size of us and was bought for almost a billion are we worth $5bn?',\" said Amel. \"Facebook will argue they are worth much more than that, forget the unrealistic figure produced by Microsoft's stake [in Facebook], as Bebo has, in the US at least, had its heyday.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
