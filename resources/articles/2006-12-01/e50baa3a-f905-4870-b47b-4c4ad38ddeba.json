Iraq's highest court on Tuesday rejected Saddam's appeal against his conviction and death sentence for the killing of 148 Shias in the northern city of Dujail in 1982. The court said the former president should be hanged within 30 days. \"According to the international conventions it is forbidden to hand a prisoner of war to his adversary,\" said Saddam's lawyer, Khalil al-Dulaimi. \"I urge all the international and legal organisations, the United Nations secretary-general, the Arab League and all the leaders of the world to rapidly prevent the American administration from handing the president to the Iraqi authorities,\" he said. An official close to the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, said that Saddam would remain in a US military prison until he is handed over to authorities in Baghdad on the day of his execution. Mr al-Dulaimi warned that turning over Saddam to the Iraqis would increase the sectarian violence that already is tearing the country apart. \"If the American administration insists in handing the president to the Iraqis, it would commit a great strategic mistake which would lead to the escalation of the violence in Iraq and the eruption of a destructive civil war,\" he said. Saddam is in the midst of another trial, charged with genocide and other crimes during a 1987-88 military crackdown on Kurds in northern Iraq. That trial was adjourned until Jan. 8, but experts have said the trial of Saddam's co-defendants is likely to continue even if he is executed. Attacks today killed at least 28 Iraqis, while the US military announced the deaths of four American soldiers and a marine. With 100 American troops dead so far this month, December is the second-deadliest month of 2006 for US military personnel. At least 105 troops died in October. Meanwhile, the US embassy said it believes four American security contractors and an Austrian are still being held captive after being kidnapped in southern Iraq six weeks ago. The men went missing November 16 when a large convoy of trucks being escorted by the Crescent Security Group was hijacked on a highway near Safwan, a city on the border with Kuwait. Suspected militiamen dressed in Iraqi police uniforms ambushed the convoy, taking 14 hostages, including the five security guards, and nine truck drivers who were later released. \"At this time, US officials believe the American citizens are still being held by their captors,\" embassy spokesman Lou Fintor said, without elaborating. A video of the kidnapped Americans reportedly surfaced this week, showing them to be alive and in good condition. The reported footage was believed to have been made about a month ago. If authentic, it would be the first proof that all five men survived the ambush."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
