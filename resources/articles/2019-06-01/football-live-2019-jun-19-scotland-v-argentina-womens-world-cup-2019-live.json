Read on ... Dear, oh dear. Here\u2019s hoping all those people who were relentless in their campaigning for VAR are happy with both themselves and the nonsensical application of the laws of the game we now have to endure. Breaking news: Argentina haven\u2019t actually been eliminated ... yet. As unlikely and implausible a scenario as it is, they could still go through if both tomorrow\u2019s games between New Zealand v Cameroon and Chile v Thailand end in draws. After the luck they enjoyed tonight, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. A quick recap: Needing nothing less than a win and leading 3-2 with just seconds of normal time remaining, Scotland had a penalty given against them for a foul on Aldana Cometti by the recently introduced Sophie Howard. Referee Ri Hyang-ok awarded the spot-kick after consulting VAR. Before the penalty was taken, the referee Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander to keep at least one foot on her line before the ball was struck by Florencia Bonsegundo, the Argentinian tasked with shooting from 12 yards. Alexander saved the subsequent penalty, but failed to stay on her line while doing so. After consulting with VAR again, Ri ordered a re-take and Bonsegundo scored with her second attempt securing a draw that was no use to either team. Despite all the time devoted to sorting out all these controversies through VAR consultations, the referee added on little more than four minutes of added time, prompting much confusion when she blew her final whistle. Scotland\u2019s captain speaks: \u201cI thought we were outstanding,\u201d says Rachel Corsie to the BBC. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t going to get the decisions. The first goal was a foul, the third goal was ridiculous. We were making a sub and defending a free-kick and for some reason she [the referee] has let play continue. We absolutely gave everything and I thought we were outstanding. We\u2019ll bounce back because we always do.\u201d Meanwhile in Nice: England have beaten Japan 2-0 and will go through to the last 16 as Group D winners. Japan have finished in second place, while Scotland and Argentina will be going home. What drama! Scotland throw away a three-goal lead and are somehow eliminated from the tournament along with Argentina. Both sets of players looked mystified when Ri Hyang-ok blew the final whistle, as they seemed to think she should have added on a lot more time to compensate for her VAR decisions. Having been 3-0 up and looking good for a place in the last 16, Scotland are out of the World Cup. It\u2019s heartwarming to see that it\u2019s not just Scotland\u2019s men who specialise in farcical World Cup exits. I have no doubt Scotland will complain about the injustice of it all but they have nobody - repeat nobody! - but themselves to blame. When the referee awarded Argentina that late penalty after a lengthy look at her pitchside monitor, she specifically told Lee Alexander to stay on her line until the kick was taken. She didn\u2019t do that, so her save counted for nothing and the penalty was retaken. Argentina complete the comeback!!! Absolute disaster for Scotland, as Bonsegundo makes no mistake with the re-take. She hits it low, hard and down the centre, sending the ball fizzing past Lee Alexander. Scotland survive! Florencia Bonsegundo\u2019s penalty is poor and Lee Alexander dives to her right to save. But the goalkeeper didn\u2019t stay on her line as instructed by the referee and it\u2019s going to be retaken. Agggggghhhh!!! Absolute disaster for Scotland as the North Korean referee consults her pitch-side monitor and awards a penalty to Argentina after repeated viewings of Sophie Howard\u2019s foul on Cometti. Scotland will argue she got a touch on the ball, but it was a very rash challenge from the substitute. 86 min: Just on as a sub, Sophie Howard trips Aldana Cometti in the Scotland penalty area. We\u2019re going to VAR and I think it\u2019s going to be a penalty for Argentina. They may be saved by a possible offside in the build-up to the penalty incident. 85 min: Erin Cuthbert is booked for time-wasting. She joins Mariana Larroquette in the notebook, the Argentinian having been cautioned a few minutes ago. 83 min: Having been in total control of this match, Scotland find themselves in all sorts of bother and have nobody to blame but themselves. A couple of lapses in concentration have helped Argentina get themselves right back into a game that looked a lost cause for them 10 minutes ago. 81 min: Another substitution for Argentina, who replace midfielder Vanesa Santana with Miriam Mayorga. Woeful from Scotland, who gift possession to Argentina on the edge of their own penalty area. To compound matters, Florencia Bonsegundo is given way too much time to pick her spot and attempt to lob Lee Alexander from distance. It\u2019s a fine effort, which is just too high for the keeper. It hits the cross-bar and bounces down, just over the line. 77 min: According to the BBC\u2019s commentary team, the picture which Erin Cuthbert removed from her sock during her goal celebrations was of herself when she was a kid. It can\u2019t have been too long ago, as she\u2019s only 20 now. Scotland fall asleep at the back and are punished. The substitute, Milagros Menendez slides the ball between the legs of goalkeeper Lee Alexander after being played in by her fellow substitute, Dalila Ippolito, who has just replaced Sole Jaimes. 74 min: In the course of her celebration of Scotland\u2019s third goal, Cuthbert removed a photo of what appeared to ba a small child from her sock, kissed it and held it aloft. We\u2019ll find out what that was all about afterwards, no doubt. 72 min: Benitez does well to rob Cuthbert on the edge of the Argentina penalty area before the Scottish striker could pick out Kim Little, who was up in support. Argentina look completely beaten here. Scotland lead by three! From the corner, Erin Cuthbert hooks the ball into an empty net from four yards out after Correa had done well to claw a looping header from Leanne Crichton on to the upright. 68 min: Erin Cuthburt, the outstanding player on the pitch, brings a good save out of Correa, who sticks a leg out to put the ball out for a corner after the Scotland striker had robbed the ball from a rival, rode a challenge and fired off a shot. 67 min: Good covering tackle from Kim Little, who gets back to dispossess Bonsegundo with Argentina looking dangerous. 64 min: That second goal has prompted a visible surge in Scottish confidence and they are really turning the screw on Argentina. They win a corner, which Kim Little sends into the mixer. The ball is punched clear by Correa, who doesn\u2019t get a decent fist on it and in the ensuing game of pinball, it fails to drop kindly for anyone in a pink shirt. 63 min: Nicola Docherty turns the Parisienne air blue, her effing and jeffing being caught on the pitch-side microphone after she\u2019s caught by a late challenge and doesn\u2019t win a free-kick. 62 min: Mariana Larroquette attempts to square the ball from the right side of the Scotland penalty area, but Jennie Beattie blocks with a well-timed challenge. 60 min: Argentina substitution: Estefania Banini, Argentina\u2019s stand-out player so far, gets the hook. She\u2019s replaced by Milagros Menendez, who is making her debut. That\u2019s a strange substitution and Banini looks decidedly unimpressed at being taken off. 58 min: Nicola Docherty is taken out by Marianna Laroquette, who flattens her with a scything challenge. Once again, referee Ri Hyang-ok elects to keep her yellow card in her pocket. 55 min: With nothing less than a win good enough, Argentina will be forced to attack more, which should leave gaps at the back for Scotland to exploit. Every goal will help them in their bid to qualify for the last 16 as one of the best third-placed teams. 53 min: Looking at a replay of that goal, the cross from Weir could not have been more perfect. Getting the ball on to her trusty left peg, the right winger delivered it on a plate for Beattie, who just had to keep the header down to beat the hopelessly exposed Correa from a few yards out. 49 min: Unmarked in the penalty area, Beattie sends a thumping header from close range past Vanina Correa after getting on the end of a cross from the right touchline from Caroline Weir. It came on the back of the aforementioned corner, which Argentina only half-cleared, allowing Scotland to fashion their second goal of the game. Scotland double their lead. Jen Beattie emulates her Scotland international rugby-playing father before her by scoring at Parc des Princes. 48 min: Erin Cuthbert wins a corner for Scotland, forcing Agustina Barroso to put the ball out of play. 47 min: More good work down the left from Emslie, who sends another cross arrowing into the Argentina box. This one isn\u2019t so good and is gathered easily by Vanina Correa. 46 min: Claire Emslie sends a cross zinging into the Argentina penalty area from the left flank, but it\u2019s a mite too high for Erin Cuthbert, who leaps but fails to get her head to the ball. Aldana Cometti clears for Argentina. 46 min: Scotland get the second half started and immediately win a throw-in deep in Argentina territory. Nothing comes of it and the South American side clear. There\u2019s just a minute of added time before the players head in for their half-time sustenance. Scotland lead courtesy of a Kim Little strike, which came mere seconds after Argentina\u2019s Marianna Larroquette had thumped a header against the cross-bar at the other end. It\u2019s all to play for in Paris, where nothing less than a win will do for either team. 45 min: Caroline Weir tries her look with a left-footed drive from distance. It swerves high and wide. 42 min: In acres of space on the right flank, Ruth Bravo sends a cross into the Scotland penalty area. It sails into the welcoming arms of goalkeeper Lee Alexander. 40 min: Referee Ri Hyang-ok and Erin Cthbert have a frank exchange of views after Nicola Docherty is penalised for some indiscretion or other. 38 min: A delightful flick from Cuthbert helps a Lee Alexander goal-kick on its way and sends Emslie scampering down the left touchline. She\u2019s unable to get past Ruth Bravo, who relieves her of possession. 37 min: Argentina goalkeeper Vanina Correa gets down to smother a Claire Emslie cross from the left towards Erin Cuthbert at her near post. 35 min: Working as a co-commentator on BBC\u2019s coverage of this game, Scott Booth, a former player and now a coach, says that Scotland are doing well but need to be more careful when it comes to keeping possession high up the pitch. They have been a bit sloppy and keep giving the ball away. 33 min: Lisa Evans latches on to a terrific ball down the right wing from Cuthbert and plays pass inside to Kirsty Smith. She doesn\u2019t release the ball and is smothered out of possession and Argentina embark on a counter-attack. With Sole Jaimes, a big unit, threatening, Rachel Corsie clears well under extreme pressure. 31 min: A good passing move from Scotland ends with Lisa Evans crossing from the left, but Claire Emslie is narrowly beaten to the ball by Ruth Bravo, who intercepts and clears for Argentina. Good link-up play in the build-up play, there, from Cuthbert, Weir and Evans. 29 min: Scotland corner. Caroline Weir sends a good delivery into the penalty area, where Erin Cuthbert gets a flick-on. The ball hits an Argentinian head and loops into the arms of goalkeeper Vanina Correa. 27 min: Facing her own goal and galloping into her own penalty area, Rachel Corsie does Argentina striker Sole Jaimes for speed as the Argentinian attempts to latch on to a through ball. Potential crisis averted. 26 min: A real handful down that left flank, Bonsegundo sends a cross into the Scotland penalty area, but goalscorer Kim Little is back on defensive duty to help clear. 24 min: Benitez shoots high over the bar from distance after good work down the left touchline from Bonsegundo, who got the better of Kirsty Smith a little too easily. 22 min: Meanwhile in Nice, England lead Japan 1-0. You can follow that one with Paul Doyle. Scotland lead! Kim Little pokes into an empty goal from six yards out. Erin Cuthburt bore down on goal after cutting in from the left and brought an excellent save out of Vanina Correa. The ball broke kindly for Cuthbert, who squared it to Little on the edge of the six-yard box. 17 min: Chance!!! A real let-off for Scotland, there, as Bonsegundo sprints down the inside left onto a brilliantly weighted ball from Banini. She sends a cross floating towards the far post, where an unmarked Marianna Larroquette rattles the crossbar with a powerful header. 14 min: Caroline Weir adjourns to the sideline for treatment on a split lip after shipping an accidental elbow in the face from Lorena Benitez. Leanne Crichton concedes her third foul of the game with another wild tackle, although she did appear to win the ball. The referee clearly thought otherwise but keeps her yellow card in her pocket. From the free-kick, Argentina lump the ball into the Scotland penalty area, where Beattie heads clear again. 12 min: Argentina throw-in, halfway inside the Scotland half. Ruth Bravo and Lorena Benitez combine down the right to get a cross into the Scotland penalty area, where Jenny Beattie clears with a header. 10 min: With 10 minutes gone there have been no chances of note for either side and while Scotland look superior to their opponents, they do look a little vulnerable at the back. Banini looks a danger for Argentina and appears to have been given a free role to roam as she pleases. 9 min: Estefanna Banini wins the first corner of the game for Argentina following a darting run into the penalty area. The ball\u2019s sent into the Scotland penalty area, where Erin Cuthbert clears with a header. 7 min: A foul throw from Eliana Stabile quite literally hands possession back to the Scots. Another roughhouse tackle from Leanne Crichton yields a free-kick for the South American side. They send the ball into the Scotland penalty area, where Nicola Docherty clears. 6 min: Caroline Weir finds the ball in space in midfield and picks out Claire Emslie on the left flank. Her touch is heavy and she gifts possession to Argentina, who go on to win a throw-in just inside the Scotland half. 5 min: Scotland forward Lisa Evans tries to go on a surging run up the right touchline, but the ball runs out of play for an Argentina throw-in. 4 min: Scotland are dominating these early stages against a team that has a reputation for defensive obduracy and bus-parking that Jose Mourinho himself would be proud of. They\u2019ll have to attack at some point in an attempt to break their tournament duck, as this is a must-win match for both teams. 2 min: Argentina striker Sole Jaimes goes down injured under a rather agricultural challenge from Leanne Crichton. It\u2019s nothing serious. 1 min: Referee Ri Hyang-ok blows her whistle and Argentina get the bvall rolling, their players kitted out in dark blue shirts, white shorts and dark blue socks. Scotland\u2019s women wear pink shirts, black shorts and pink socks. Jenny Beattie sends Caroline Weir on her way up the inside left flanks and the ball\u2019s played into the centre to Caroline Weir. She fails to control it, but it breaks kindly for Erin Cuthbert, who shoots wide from distance. Early signs of attacking intent from Scotland. Not long now: It\u2019s a sunny evening in Paris and the teams are out on the Parc des Princes sward. It\u2019s time for the national anthems and Scotland\u2019s players and supporters give Flower of Scotland plenty of welly. Argentina\u2019s is next and is similarly stirring, getting a huge round of applause from what looks to be a very big crowd. An email from Daniel Strauss: \u201cI was lucky enough to get to see Kim Little play while she was here in Seattle and she is spectacular,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of my all time favorite players to see live, it\u2019s a shame that her tournament might end today.\u201d Little, who currently plays for Arsenal, made 63 appearances for Seattle Reign. Trivia corner: Jenny Beattie will line up in the heart of Scotland\u2019s defence tonight, at a stadium where her father, John Beattie, once scored a try against France. You can see it around the 40-second mark in the YouTube clip posted below. Shelley Kerr speaks: \u201cWe need a defensive midfielder to allow Kim [Little] and and Erin [Cuthbert] to link up further up the pitch,\u201d says Scotland\u2019s manager of her decision to include Leanne Crichton, in an interview with the BBC. \u201cIn tournament football you need a freshness,\u201d she says, when asked why Claire Emslie is in. \u201cClaire has been rested and hopefully she\u2019ll be fresh enough to play tonight. In fact I know she will be. We\u2019ve gone for an attacking line-up.\u201d Before the game, Sir Alex Ferguson got in touch with Scotland\u2019s manager. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to get a personal message from a legend,\u201d says Kerr. \u201cHis advice on tonight\u2019s game is to go and enjoy it.\u201d Meet today\u2019s referee ... Ri Hyang-ok is a 38-year-old former football international from North Korea. Let\u2019s hear her tell us a little about herself ... Scotland (4-3-3): Alexander, Smith, Corsie, Beattie, Docherty, Little, Weir, Crichton, Cuthbert, Emslie, Evans. Argentina (4-4-2): Correa, Bravo, Barroso, Cometti, Stabile, Larroquette, Santana, Benitez, Bonsegundo, Banini, Jaimes. Referee: Ri Hyang-ok (North Korea) Team news Scotland manager Shelley Kerr makes three changes to the team that started against Japan. Full-back Lizzie Arnot, midfielder Hayley Lauder and striker Jane Ross make way for Nicola Docherty, Leanne Crichton and Claire Emslie. Caroline Weir speaks Asked by Fifa.com for her thoughts on today\u2019s opponents, Scotland and Manchester City midfielder Caroline Weir suggested her side will not be underestimating their opponents. \u201cThey look aggressive, they look fast, they look physical, it\u2019s going to be another difficult game and one that we won\u2019t take lightly at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. We have nothing to lose, we have to go for it and it makes it exciting for us as players. It\u2019s very clear what we have to do: we have to get three points. Sometimes it\u2019s easier going into a game like that, knowing that it\u2019s a must win.\u201d Shelley Kerr v Hope Solo Everybody loves a good row and one has been simmering between the former USA goalkeeper-turned-pundit, Hope Solo and Scotland manager Shelley Kerr. Solo was less than complimentary about Kerr when Scotland went in at the break 2-0 down against Japan in their last game, following defeat in their opener against England. Following an improved second-half performance they went on to lose 2-1 for the second time in as many games. \u201cThis is what I was hoping Shelley Kerr would have fixed from the first game on Sunday,\u201d said Solo. \u201cUnfortunately the verdict is out if she is a great tactician and right now I have my doubts. It goes back to the first game that Scotland played against England. These are the differences between a win and a loss and this is what I wanted Shelley Kerr to affect. She said she was going to go back and watch the footage, break down the video, and she still has not made these changes.\u201d Kerr was withering in her response when told about Solo\u2019s criticism of her work, insisting the American has not earned the right to criticise her. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve no problem with stick, I\u2019ll take it all day long \u2013 just maybe off someone who comes from coaching stock,\u201d she said. \u201cTactically I thought we got things right against Japan. We made some errors in the first half but I thought our game plan was working really well. Japan\u2019s movement is incredible. They maybe don\u2019t have great pace but the way they move off the ball makes up for that. Combating these things is always easier said than done.\u201d Solo had accused Scotland\u2019s players of dropping too deep and giving their Japanese opponents too much time on the ball. \u201cJapan, right now, are doing what they want to do on the ball because of the amount of space on the field,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing a lot of movement in the entire Scottish team, there\u2019s no dynamic runs and everyone\u2019s just kind of waiting for the ball.\u201d Parc des Princes is the venue where Scotland play Argentina for the very first time in one of two remaining matches in Group D. At the same time in Nice, England and Nice will go toe to toe, with both sides having already qualified for the last 16. Having lost their opening two games, Scotland must win tonight to have any chance of progressing as one of the best third placed sides on goal difference. While they are still in the hunt for second place in the group, a win for Argentina would guarantee their progress to the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams at least. Kick-off is at 8pm BST but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
