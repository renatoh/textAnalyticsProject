He packed on the muscle and bone mass during his teens and early twenties, when his testosterone was pumping at peak level. Like most normal, healthy men in his early thirties, he'll probably be able to do around 36 press-ups in two minutes (at least that's what the US air force suggests for civilians). Though his strength and endurance have slowed a bit from the Adonis days of his early twenties (when 42 press-ups in 120 seconds were easy), in terms of physique and attitude, he's looking good. Except you may notice - with some secret sadness - a slight thickening around the waist. This is the first physical manifestation of the 6.6lb of muscle he'll lose to fat every decade from the age of 20 (a loss which speeds up even more after the age of 45). If it's noticeable now, that's because fat has three times the bulk of muscle. Six-packs are harder to come by these days, even though he may eat as healthily and exercise as hard as he ever did. The thirties are when many men (and their partners) are considering having children. His testosterone levels and corresponding libido - at their peak from the ages of 17 to 26 - have already started the gentle decline they'll continue throughout his life. You may notice he's not as up for 'it' quite so often: those 135 orgasms a year he had in his twenties have dropped to 102 in his thirties (and will be down to 70 a year in his forties). You'd think his sperm, manufactured so box-fresh compared to your date-stamped eggs, would be in perfect shape. Yet halfway through this decade, his male biological clock will gently start tick ing, as the quality and motility of his sperm decline slightly. It's mostly his age, but his lifestyle - especially if he smokes - could increase the damage. But the biggest problem that you, and undoubtedly he, will be facing right now is on top of his head. Or not. Bald is not an easy concept and by the early stage of this decade, it's one which will be worrying him a lot. By the age of 35, almost two in five men have permanent hair loss. Male pattern baldness (or alopecia androgenetica) means hair starts thinning at the crown and temples. It's genetic, though don't blame it solely on his dad. For a long-range forecast of a man's follicular progress, it's wiser to check out the state of his maternal grandfather's pate, because the strongest influence on hair loss comes through the female side. Women Her sexual peak Thus far, all her physiological functions have been gearing up for one purpose: producing babies. Her body is in great shape. Her bones and muscles are at their strongest, and oestrogen and progesterone are pumping round at peak levels. So it's with some regret that you - and worse, she - now see the first gentle signs of ageing: a tiny wrinkle at the corner of her eyes, a slight frown line on her forehead, an almost imperceptible thinning of the flesh on her face and hands. A woman's skin is less thick and oil-rich than yours and so shows signs of age up to five years earlier. In her twenties, her skin renewed itself every two to three weeks. By her mid-thirties, it takes a little longer. Her body shape is changing, too. She carries more fat than you do, on the curves around her hips and bottom, which is a useful storehouse during pregnancy. Now, as her metabolism slows by about 0.5 per cent a year and she starts to lose some muscle, her waist may thicken a little as fat gets deposited around her abdomen instead. Like most women, she probably knows the benefits of exercise and healthy eating - and sometimes even practises them. She won't be aware of it, but from her mid-thirties onwards, she will be losing bone mass at the rate of 1 per cent per year, starting with the bones of the spine, wrist and lower jaw. A calcium-rich diet - or supplementation - becomes increasingly pertinent, along with weight-bearing exercise such as walking, running or cycling three to six times a week to keep her bones healthy and strong. She should have little trouble getting pregnant until she's reaches the age of 37, at which point her fertility drops rapidly, and the risks of genetic abnormalities and miscarriage increase. By the time she's 40, IVF success rates fall to about 5 per cent. That's because, unlike your sperm which is manufactured near-fresh each ejaculation, her eggs were created at the same time that she was, and are ageing, too. The difficulty now seems to be when to fit sex in. Like many thirtysomething women (and men), she works and plays hard. The price - evening and weekend exhaustion - often makes a sex session seem less attractive than a full night's sleep. Which is a shame, because the years from 35 to 42 are when she's at her sexual prime. This is the time when her sexual confidence reaches its peak. Orgasm raises her testosterone levels by 42 per cent, according to one study, and testosterone is the hormone that controls libido in both men and women. A prime case of use it or lose it. Forties Men Why Scandinavian woodmen stay sexy This is the decade of truth - when the past 20 years start to show in his body. It's also the time when he starts to reflect on his life and question his achievements. Now the kids are growing up and he's past the halfway mark of his allocated 74-year life span, he'll be contemplating middle age and his own mortality. It's called the midlife crisis. Let's start with some good news. Scientists used to think that the body was programmed to age like a biological clock. Now they believe the process is only 25 per cent genetic or inbuilt: the rest is from accumulated cell damage due to lifestyle and accident. This is excellent because it means things are reversible. And what's most reversible is body size. Since his resting metabolism drops by about 2 per cent per decade, if he's still eating like a 20-year-old, then he'll probably have noticed that his clothes are a bit tighter. He may even have gone up a shirt size or two. That's because fat now starts to be deposited internally and on the torso (areas which increase the danger of heart disease) rather than under the skin and on the limbs. (Men tend to eat more fat than women anyway - 26 per cent of men get more than 40 per cent of their calories from fat.) But he'll understand that body fat is entirely linked to lifestyle - Norwegian lumberjacks retain only 13 per cent body fat throughout their lives. Which means that if he's eating right and exercising enough, he too can still have the physique (though hopefully not the dress sense) of a sexy Scandinavian woodsman. The fat and fitness issues are important now because the highest-risk period for heart attacks in men begins in their mid-forties. Just like you, he should be doing aerobic exercise for at least 50 minutes three times a week (and that three-hour round of Sunday golf doesn't count). Aerobic exercise means breathing hard - even getting breathless. If he doesn't do this, he'll lose about 10 per cent of his heart and lung capacity during the decade. Sex, as always, is good for him and what could be more invigorating than to learn that three times a week is the magic number, cutting his risk of heart attack by half. Sex raises his testosterone levels by 7 per cent, which compensates, temporarily at least, for the gentle decline of testosterone production since his late twenties. This decline could account for his slight loss of libido. Or indeed for his midlife crisis. Researchers are still debating the hormonal, psychological and sociological causes of the so-called male menopause. But the truth is that, provided he hasn't run off with the nanny, any partner of his will need strength and compassion to deal with the sleeplessness, loss of identity, fatigue, depression, irritability and general lifestyle reappraisal that he may be going through. Meanwhile, at least his skin is looking great. Being considerably thicker and oilier than women's, it will continue looking up to five years younger than yours for a while to come. Yes, he'll have smile lines and lines on his forehead, but they'll only add to his attraction by providing evidence of his maturity, growing self-knowledge and wisdom. Women It starts heading south The forties are a time of physical and emotional strength. Yes, her body is starting to show little signs of ageing, and she may feel physically a little more fallible. Yet, paradoxically, her personal power has never been greater. Still she looks at herself in the mirror and cannot believe her changing face: the first flecks of grey have arrived around her hairline, her jaw is less defined even while the bone structure of her face is more pronounced, as the skin has thinned and refined. Botox withstanding, she wears the lines of her smile or frown even in their absence. Her body shape is still - how do we put this politely? - developing. After pregnancy and childbirth, those fat depositories around hips and thighs have now spread upwards to her torso. The forties can be a time of weight gain. Like you, she will be battling to keep the weight off her waist, chest and shoulders. Unless she is exercising with the regime of a marathon runner, she will lose from 5 to 10 per cent of her heart and lung capacity in this decade. In practical terms, that means that she becomes more quickly breathless just walking up stairs. She may notice that her flesh, especially around the breasts and buttocks, is succumbing to gravity. Even the texture of the skin around her knees will become dryer and looser as the decade wears on, thanks to a decline in oestrogen, which in turn leads to a decrease in collagen and elastin in the dermis of the skin. Sexually, though, this is a time of enormous confidence, and ever-increasing satisfaction. She knows what she wants and is now more likely to be relaxed enough to get it. Towards the end of the decade - two to five years before she reaches menopause, which most commonly occurs at the age of 51 - she may start the physical and emotional merry-go-round of the peri-menopause. Wildly fluctuating oestrogen levels, missed periods and headaches are just a few of the symptoms. Yet she can still become pregnant: just look at Cherie Blair. The stress of this can lead to low mood and even depression: 20 per cent of fortysomething women suffer from some kind of depressive disorder, though no one knows to what extent this is caused by fluctuating hormones. Whatever, this is the start of her midlife crisis, and it needs the same patience, tact and unending adoration as yours did a few years earlier. Fifties Men The distinguished years From the ages of 20 to 50, his testosterone levels will have dropped by about a third. That's nothing like the precipitous hormone crash that you'll suffer at menopause, but it still causes some interesting effects. Such as prostate enlargement. He'll first notice this in the middle of the night when he wakes up desperate to go to the loo. When the prostate - the walnut-sized gland around the neck of the bladder - swells, it squeezes the urethra. It isn't serious: it's just one of the noticeable consequences of ageing. As, sadly, is the angle of his erection. At 30, it rose proud to 20 above the horizontal; now at 50, it's down to slightly below horizontal (and that slips to 25 under by the age of 70. Although 80 per cent of fiftysomething men can achieve and maintain an erection with ease, it'll probably be a bit 'softer' than before. Though you shouldn't let that interfere with anything: this is the age when youthful energy is replaced by the gourmet sex of true intimacy. It's true that his strength did plateau over the past two decades, and over the next 15 years, he'll see a 20 per cent decline in strength thanks largely to changes in his musculoskeletal system. His body doesn't quite work as fast or efficiently as it once did. From the mid-fifties, his bones will start to decrease a little each year, and he will shrink a quarter of an inch every 10 years. If he was 6ft at the age of 30, that means he'll be 5ft 11in tall at 60, due to a compression of the spaces between the discs in the spine. It's perhaps these small inconveniences and indignities that make men in their fifties twice as likely to say they are in poor health than men in their thirties. He still thinks he's young, but his body is telling him he's getting older. This is certainly the decade when circulatory diseases and especially coronary heart disease start to take a heavy toll. But of the five major risk factors, four - smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure - are lifestyle dependent. Only family history is outside his control. In some ways, he's starting to look increasingly distinguished. The number of melanocytes or pigment cells in his skin is declining by 10 to 20 per cent each decade. In his forties, you'll have noticed salt and pepper eyebrows and greying temples. Now the hair on his head - and chest - will be turning steely grey. Male pattern baldness, suffered by one in two men, will continue its assault on his crown and temples. His cheeks and jowls may have that Michael Douglas look - charmingly saggy around the edges - and his nose and earlobes will lengthen. You want some good news? He has fewer sweat glands. And middle-aged memory loss - those much feared 'senior moments' - has been proved something of a chimera. His memory and intellectual competence is mostly as good, if not better, than ever. It's only episodic memory - remembering where he left those damned cars keys - that occasionally slips. The trouble is, now he puts that down to age rather than simple human forgetfulness. Women The big 'M' arrives To say this is a time of profound change is to understate the case. The menopause - defined as the date of a woman's final menstrual period plus one year - is the end result of a process of oestrogen and progesterone decline which causes a woman's reproductive life to end. The potential short-term symptoms of plummeting oestrogen include hot flushes, night sweats, headaches, tiredness, palpitations, vaginal dryness, memory loss, tearfulness, anxiety and loss of libido. A pretty comprehensive bag, though she may sail through with no problems at all - 43 per cent of menopausal women in a recent study said they didn't suffer from any of the above, while only 22 per cent found their symptoms debilitating. As oestrogen declines, fat deposits become concentrated in specific and rather strange areas (on her earlobes, chin and under the eyes) as well as the obvious (bottom, abdomen, thighs). Postmenopausally, she'll also lose the health protection oestrogen afforded her against stroke and coronary heart disease, which becomes the major killer of women over 45. Osteoporosis or brittle bone disease - when your bones have thinned by more than one third, leading to the possibility of fractures - affects the majority of older women to some extent (only 2 per cent of men suffer, usually those who have been taking oral steroids for years). Long term, this means a calcium-rich, low-saturated-fat diet with plenty of oily fish, plus weight-bearing and aerobic exercise for 25 minutes six times a week. Oh, and for optimum health, she will need 50 calories fewer a day than she did at 40. One third of fiftysomething women lose interest in sex - one study recently suggested that British women in their fifties had sex only once a month or less. But whatever the frequency, she'll still find it easy to reach orgasm (and even multiple orgasm) though the number of contractions she has per second - and therefore the intensity of the experience - often lessens. Unless she's one of the superyoung - those lucky people who look 10 years younger than their true age - her skin and hair will have been losing pigmentation at a rate of 10 to 20 per cent per decade. This means she has a one in two chance of being grey by the time she is 50. While her skin becomes sallower - more yellow than English rose - her body hair may start to thicken and darken. In this decade, the supportive fat layers in the hypodermis, the lower level of her skin, also diminish, which causes looser, more delicate skin all over the body. Sixties Men Viagra, restless nights and nose trimmers The great news for men in their sixties is that the penis has staying power (at least when they're asleep). Under 40, he has 4.2 nighttime erections which last for a total of two hours and 20 minutes. At the age of 60-plus, he has 3.5 nighttime erections which last for one hour and 55 minutes. Not bad, all considered. Sadly though, the angle of that erection is sinking: from 20 above horizontal at the age of 30, to 25 below at the age of 70. And even better, only just over 20 per cent of men his age experience problems achieving or maintaining an erection during waking hours. (And if he can't, that's what God made Viagra for.) Erections apart, he might find it that bit harder to get a good night's sleep. OK, he doesn't need as much nowadays, but if he has sleep apnea (when he briefly stops breathing then starts again with a snore) it will be fitful and unrefreshing. And that enlarged prostate may be forcing him to get up and pee two or three times a night now. Just like yours, his physiognomy is changing, especially around the jowls. His earlobes and nose, too, are getting wider and longer, and he'll need the trimmers to deal with the hair that has colonised there. Meanwhile, the hair on his head will still be thinning slightly, unless he's one of the lucky third of 65-year-olds who experience no permanent hair loss at all. Testosterone levels fall gently from his twenties until, by 80, they are at pre-pubertal levels. This decline accounts for the loss in body hair you may also begin to notice. He may also, like you, need specs, and be a little harder of hearing. From the ages of 30 to 70, his lung capacity decreases by half, as his ribcage lowers, his spine compresses and he loses strength in the abdominal muscles. Except it needn't necessarily be so. When a group of sedentary 60- to 70-year-olds carried out 45 minutes of aerobic activity three days a week for three months, they showed gains in their aerobic capacity and a doubling in the oxidative capacity of their muscles. Exercise and a healthy diet will also help protect him against the increased risk of heart disease. By and large, though, the average 65-year-old man is fit, healthy and relatively prosperous. And he can be even fitter just by going, er, slower in the gym. By raising a weight for 10 seconds instead of the recommended two (yes, it's hard), then lowering it for four seconds, he'll double the strength benefits to his muscles. Whatever his age. Women The bonus years One of the unsung achievements of the 20th century was to add 20 years to our life expectancy. As a result, women can expect to live to 82 (as a man you lose out four years before at the age of 78). By 2025, as life expectancy continues to climb, it is estimated that she'll reach the age of 93, while your life span will increase to four score and five. This has enormous repercussions (and not just for our pensions). Increasingly, the sixties are looking like 'middle-middle-age' rather than the beginnings of old age, which now kick off proper in the mid- to late 70s. Still, you'll notice some gentle changes. Thanks to the loss of oestrogen and corresponding increase in the male hormone androgen, her hair may start to thin on her head and pubic area, and coarsen and darken slightly on her face, chin and body. Her skin is becoming still thinner, and will continue to lose elasticity. Skin repair is less efficient now, due to lowered blood supply and DNA damage (often caused by sun exposure), and age spots - those small, dark pigmented areas - will show up on her hands and face. Bags may form underneath her eyes, and her nose and earlobes will widen and lengthen slightly. If she's unlucky she may get thinning and sagging of the jowls, cruelly known as 'turkey neck' - for which surgery is the only solution. Her body shape, though, may slim down as her appetite decreases. That's a mixed blessing as now, more than ever, she needs her full quota of nutritional goodies, including calcium-rich foods to protect her bones. Forty per cent of women over the age of 50 suffer a fracture, and the risk of osteoporosis increases throughout the decade. Diet can also help combat her biggest threat: heart disease. At 65 to 74, her risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is nearly 10 times greater than at the age of 45 to 54, thanks largely to the decline in oestrogen and the probability of high blood pressure, which affects 70 per cent of the over-65s. (Your risk of heart disease - though still greater than hers - only rises around five times during the same time frame.) Her libido may be in pretty good shape, since it's related to the level of testosterone in her body. Unlike oestrogen, testosterone is still produced by her ovaries, fatty tissue and adrenal glands even after the menopause. But chances are she's a lot more youthful and energetic than women even younger than her were in the past. So she - and you - have a great future. Even at this minute, she's probably reminding herself that Coco Chanel retired at 55. But then went back to work at the grand young age of 71."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
