Eliahu Inbal is due to take up the reins next season, but the orchestra's British visit is in the hands of the prodigiously talented 28-year-old Jakub Hrusa, who is himself lined up to become the new music director of Glyndebourne On Tour. Despite his still developing reputation, Hrusa steps up to command this venerable institution as if born to it. And the Czech Philharmonic is an ensemble which excels in honouring its own. The band plays Dvor\u00e1k the way most people breathe oxygen, and the rabble-rousing account of the Seventh Symphony was as impeccable as might be expected. Bohuslav Martinu remains a pivotal, if rather underexposed figure in Czech music, who was once a violinist with the Philharmonic. Martinu managed to absorb all the currents of the early 20th-century avant garde, though arguably without adding an indelible stamp of his own (unless one counts the seemingly compulsory use of the piano, which underpins much of his work). The Estampes suite from 1958 is a fairly ephemeral late piece of misty-eyed nostalgia, reminiscent of Jan\u00e1cek's woodland tone painting from the Cunning Little Vixen, but lacking the mischievous humour. Nicola Benedetti's brilliant assault on Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto brought spontaneous applause at the end of the first movement. Yet the remainder was scuppered by a drifting G string which threw her intonation awry and demonstrated the perils of performing on a priceless Stradivarius with 300-year-old tuning pegs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
