That the man giving a very passable impression of an England striker was David Nugent will have been greeted with disbelief at Fratton Park, where the 24-year-old has endured a miserable couple of years since being signed by Harry Redknapp for \u00a36m. The powerful header and beautifully curled shot with which he won the game for the Clarets after coming on as a second-half substitute came as a startling riposte to his critics. His comments afterwards, while delivered with a gentle smile, were almost as venomous. Suggesting the blame for a record of three league goals in 34 games for Portsmouth lay almost entirely at the door of the club, Nugent said he would dearly love to make the loan deal, which expires at the end of January, permanent. \"I'd like to show Portsmouth fans and the people down there what they've been missing,\" he said. \"Maybe they might be a little bit gutted that they let me go. It has been difficult to keep my confidence up because it's been so frustrating, not playing games.\" The biggest problem, he insisted, was that Pompey played him out of position. \"Play me as a striker and I'll score goals,\" he said. \"I'm not a winger. As I showed today when I came on \u2013 they stuck me up front and I bagged two goals. I played the odd game for Portsmouth up front, which I scored goals in, but all of a sudden I'd get put back on the wing, for the formation.\" Next Saturday's trip to Tottenham, managed by Redknapp, would appear to offer Nugent another opportunity to make a point. It took about three months, the striker said, before he accepted the manager didn't \"fancy\" him. \"Obviously there was a bit of trouble there, but it was the players that he brought in as well. He was buying strikers, Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch, Benjani, John Utaka \u2013 there were a lot of strikers there who I was behind. I was trying my best in training but it wasn't good enough.\" Now, however, Nugent believes he can not only rekindle his Premier League career, but his international career as well. \"Ever since I got that [solitary] England cap against Andorra before I signed for Portsmouth it's been downhill, but hopefully now I can try and get back in the squad,\" he said. \"If my goalscoring record keeps on improving for Burnley, then I don't see why not.\" Burnley gave away only four free-kicks - the lowest in a Premier League match this season - and two of those were in the first five minutes. Sunderland were guilty of 20 fouls Burnley's manager Owen Coyle made the valid point that his team improved after the interval, as they had to after being second best against a Sunderland team who should have been clear by half-time. As it was Anton Ferdinand's reckless challenge on Wade Elliott, resulting in a penalty converted by Graham Alexander, gave Burnley an early lead and though Sunderland dominated thereafter, they had only Darren Bent's calm finish to show for their efforts.
