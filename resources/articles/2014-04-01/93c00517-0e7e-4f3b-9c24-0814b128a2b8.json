When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge grace us with their presence, we step back in time. The Duchess of Cambridge is an attractive young woman who wears her clothes well. Her baby is cute. Her style is more accessible than Gwyneth Paltrow's, and there can be little harm in looking at the photos. But how can we live peacefully in a society that accepts that some people can be born to rule? How can we explain the extraordinary bowing and scraping and sheer excitement from people who have earned their position in society \u2013 namely, our prime minister \u2013 at the mere prospect of being in the presence of a couple of 30 year olds and a baby? I don't resent their luxurious jet setting lifestyle; many people are born into a life of privilege through no merit of their own. But in Australia, although there are vast inequities of birth, and indeed of life, we do not believe that any person is better than another. We elect our leaders, and then we mock them. That is Australian. Paul Duffy (posts as Longerenong): the life inflicted on the royals is just plain cruel William and Catherine seem to be a really nice young couple and I hope they have fun in Australia. But I do feel sorry for them. They are condemned to a life of smiling, waving, receiving flowers and never really being able to say what they really think. This little family also has to carry the burden of making the royal family look young and in touch, when the opposite is true. Really, under what pretext can people continue to support having a royal family? It's just plain cruel. Keeping royalty means having one family captive to the fantasy of others. Look at Charles: what type of life could he have had if he didn't have to play the royalty game? He could have married who he wanted to when he wanted to, followed all his half-wacky interests, or have a real job. He could have spoken his mind on all things political, and not have to sneakily send letters to politicians. I have no problem with the royals as a family. If Betty knocked on my front door I would invite her in for a cup of tea and a chin wag \u2013 after all she has met just about every world leader of the last 60 years, she must have some great stories (wouldn't a \"Queen tells all\" book be a best seller?). But if I did have a chat with her, I would feel obliged to mention that I thought she was captive to a cruel system, and her family subjected to the worst type of inhuman cruelty. They simply cannot not be themselves, and nobody has the right to ask them to suffer that. Jason (posts as RationalAnimal): The Queen has paid for her privilege with a life of continual public duty When members of the royal family visit Australia, there's often a flutter of media articles about why we need an Australian republic. This time, Tony Abbott's surprise announcement about knights and dames got in first, so the anti-royalist brigade have had something else to focus their boorish parochialism on, besides the Australian monarchy. Yes, that's right \u2013 the Australian monarchy. As long as the Crown is part of our constitution, the Royals are part of this country, mainly as a symbolic political entity but also as a reminder that Australia is a fundamentally British society. This is precisely the problem for many so-called republicans: most of our local republicanism is really just anti-British nationalism. If the House of Windsor emigrated here, the republican \"cause\" would be even more hopeless than it is now. There are some good arguments for an Australian republic, but they're more about strengthening the constitution and counterbalancing the status of prime ministers and premiers, rather than nonsense about national identity. Unfortunately, the favourite arguments of many anti-monarchists are often groundless or unfair. Take the whinge about the lack of royal commitment to Australia: \"All we get are fleeting visits, like the Duke and Duchess' latest whirlwind tour\". But the fact is that, despite the fanfare, Australia doesn't really make the royal family welcome. We don't provide them with even one permanent residence they can call home, although there are plenty of suitable properties. So what more can we expect? Republicanism originated in ancient Greece and Rome, and its deeper meaning is all about accountable government and active citizenship that serves the common good. Both Australia and the UK are already crowned republics in all but name. The Queen has paid for her privilege with a life of continual public duty, above and beyond what most people would be prepared to do. William and Kate seem to be following in her footsteps. Until we can really show how a formal republic will improve Australian politics, we republicans should make them welcome. Marja Berclouw (posts as Mountwilliam): the monarchy is synonymous with stability Yes, I am still laughing at Abbott's decision to bring back knights and dames. For a country like Australia, it seems more than slightly anachronistic and very, very comic. I have no strong feelings for or against the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visit, and give only a cursory look as a segment on the evening news. I noticed the red dress. I noticed the traditional Maori greeting, the hongi, and noticed Prince George dangling in his mother's arms. I noticed the outstretched hands of the crowds reaching out \u2013 but I won't be one of them in Australia. I won't be collecting memorabilia or putting out flags either. And yet, I would describe myself as a monarchist, for the simple reason that I equate it with stability. I equate the institution, as it exists for me here in Australia as part of the Commonwealth, with an arrangement based on laws argued, refined and evolved over time; laws that define, describe and govern the limits of power of the head of state. While the notion of a republic with its connotation of government by the people, and with its connotation of freedom to choose any and everybody, may seem attractive, I believe that we, in Australia, have no less freedom to choose who governs us because we are part of the Commonwealth with a monarch as figurehead. Mark Fletcher: the visit allows us to celebrate the absurdity of political authority There is an absurdity at the heart of all political systems: what is the source of law? Why can the person in the curly wig decide that my freedoms should be curtailed? Why can a particular group of people with no discernable expertise enact \"law\", while a different group of experts cannot? How does common law even work, really? There are lots of very peculiar answers, often involving hand-waving and slogans \u2013 \"The Will of the people!\" \"The Constitution!\" \"Grundnorms!\" \u2013 but they're not terribly satisfying. Constitutional monarchies, in this regard, are unique. Denying the rational, mathematical, or transcendental myths of law, they embrace its cultural, historical, and accidental reality. The ground of our legal system isn't some abstract, pseudo-religious concept. It's a person. It's a little old woman who was once an army mechanic. Our head of state \u2013 avoiding unhelpfully pedantic understandings of that term \u2013 derives authority through accident of birth. This is no weirder than having a head of state appointed by an electoral college or than having a head of state appointed by consent of the major political parties. The key feature of our system is that we have domesticated the tyrannical, personal nature of political authority through the rule of law. Instead of trying to absorb the tyrannical element back into the populist arena of politics (as republicans desire), we have disempowered the tyrant. The visit of the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge allows us to celebrate the absurdity \u2013 the mysterious irrationality \u2013 of political authority. Here are two young people, one of whom will transfigure into the embodiment of the sovereign authority, enjoying rides in bright red jet boats. Marvellous! Finbar O'Mallon (posts as EloquentDog): we need a new flag for Turnbull's barricades \"I'm a proud republican. I didn't see you at the barricades,\" shouted Malcolm Turnbull to the ALP. The barricades are abandoned, and the republican movement died with Turnbull watching it happen in 1999. The monarchists had made it sound all too hard, too risky. Now, support for a republic is low. Luckily Australians cannot be cowed with an economic noose, our coffers are our own. Australia covets ties across the Pacific, not with Europe. We no longer hang the Queen's picture at our pubs. Australians didn't die for the crown at Gallipoli, they died for each other. Korea was when we went to war to save the world and not England, and it's the USA \u2013 not England \u2013 that has a base in Darwin. Whites came here worshipping one god and now we recognise many. Yet still, our prime minister calls Bill Shorten, \"Her Majesty's leader of the opposition\", and we sing a colonialist ode (remember the old lyrics, \"From England soil and Fatherland?\") to the Union Jack. Why so much love for a crown that doesn't or never has, given us anything? How many Aboriginal-Australians, Irish-Australians or Lebanese-Australians do you see asking us to respect the crown (or British expatriates for that matter)? Sure, the need for a republic may not be necessary, but it is inevitable. There is serious political capital to be gained in tacking on republicanism in a time when voters seem more disillusioned than ever. Conservative monarchists seem tied to traditions that means, at times, opposing gay marriage and opposing updating an outdated constitution that doesn't recognise the First Australians. These things could become the fundamentals of our new republic. But perhaps that's too big in scope, and baby steps should be taken. What might be needed, if Australia copies New Zealand, is a new flag for Turnbull's barricades. A small change, not a flag to salute or die for, but simply a flag without the Union Jack and not a relic of a fading empire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
