This New York quintet session, including US star sidemen Mark Turner (sax) and Clarence Penn (drums), seems certain to broaden his audience. Maalouf has dedicated this album to Miles Davis, and it often uncannily echoes Sketches of Spain, but transformed in pitch by an Arabic influence. It's a session of poise, variety and sublime skill, moving from folk themes with Celtic lilts to hook-based funky pieces and evocative ballads. Some passages build like Brad Mehldau pieces, hinting at melodies and grooves. Sensuality has a stealthily playful theme and a steady Cuban dance pulse, but keeps throwing stylistic surprises. A startling new voice in contemporary jazz has arrived."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
