It was the 21-year-old\u2019s biggest scalp so far. And the way she did it, powering clear on the final lap to win in 2:00:34 \u2013 over a second and a half clear of Nakaayi, who had won gold in Doha just five months ago - yet again reinforced the impression that from almost nowhere she has become a medal contender at the Tokyo Olympics. It was Reekie\u2019s second world indoor series win in five days, having won the 1500m at the Glasgow Grand Prix on Saturday, and capped an indoor season where she has broken three British records. Yet Reekie, a double European under-23 champion in Sweden last year, believes there is a lot more to come. \u201cIt was a tough field out there \u2013 I would have liked to have gone a bit faster because I know what shape I\u2019m in but I\u2019ll take the win,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of the indoor season. I\u2019m going back into a heavy block of training to prepare for the summer. I will be back to work on Thursday and be off Friday.\u201d Reekie\u2019s coach, Andy Young, who recently said he had rarely seen anyone with such a special kick, admitted he was surprised how easily she had won. \u201cI was really impressed,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked way too in control - almost too comfortable. That\u2019s the way to do it, if you can do it that way. Earlier this month Reekie ran 1:57.91 for the 800m, the fastest indoors since 2006, but Young said her form was not a shock given how well she had trained over the winter. \u201cHer times over 800m didn\u2019t desperately surprise me but to take on the best in the world and show them how it\u2019s done, that\u2019s something quite special,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have been working on technique for some time. She\u2019s had a much healthier winter \u2013 we\u2019ve not had to deal with any issues. It\u2019s a long-term project and we are just beginning to see the start of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
