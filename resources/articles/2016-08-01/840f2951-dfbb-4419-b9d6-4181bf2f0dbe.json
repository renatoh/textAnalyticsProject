The two friends, who won gold in the team sprint with Philip Hindes on Friday night, will go head-to-head in the Rio velodrome on Sunday at 9.04pm UK time. They are sharing a room in the Olympic village, which may make pre-race preparation a little tricky. Given that Kenny is the reigning Olympic champion, it was something of a surprise that Skinner was the first to reach the final, after beating Australia\u2019s Matthew Glaetzer in two successive matches. Kenny lost his first semi-final against Denis Dmitriev by some margin, which meant his match went to three agonising races. He won the last two, however, leaving the Russian to fight it out for bronze with Glaetzer. Skinner, a 23-year-old Scotsman, was under enormous pressure in the team sprint, with the unenviable job of taking over from Chris Hoy. Until just a few months ago it was not clear he had what it took. He was not the original favourite to fill Hoy\u2019s cycling shoes. That burden first fell to his housemate in Manchester, Kian Emadi, who had to switch to endurance after hurting his back, putting Skinner in selection contention. He made the team sprint trio but they finished a fairly miserable sixth at the world championships in March, with reports from training that Skinner just did not have the speed to hold Hindes\u2019s or Kenny\u2019s wheel. In the individual sprint he did even worse in the world championship race, trailing in eighth place. He worked on his strength to close the gap, with British Cycling insiders insisting the gold medal on Friday was ultimately down to his hard work and perseverance. Though he is the fastest man in the world on one lap, if his team-mates cannot hold his wheel he cannot win anything. Team GB mechanics ended up putting an even bigger gear on his bike to slow him down enough for Skinner to hold on in his \u201cman three\u201d position. Born in Glasgow but raised in Edinburgh, Skinner and his little brother, Roy, started cycling on the outdoor track at Meadowbank in the Scottish capital. Talent-spotted at a young age, after breaking Hoy\u2019s British national 200m record for his age category. He had to take time away from the sport in late 2011 as it was feared he had lymphoma; after testing, it was discovered he had been misdiagnosed, but his time away from the sport meant he was not considered for London 2012. Kenny is already well known, having won two golds at those home Olympics, to add to the gold and silver he had nabbed in Beijing. Yet despite having a leisure centre in Bolton named after him, the only thing most people know about the quiet 28-year-old is that he is engaged to the much chattier Laura Trott, who won her third gold in the team pursuit on Saturday night. It is Kenny who goes into the final as favourite. But given Skinner\u2019s performance in the semi-final, it may be him who triumphs in the battle for sprinting supremacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
