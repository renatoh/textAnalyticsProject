Arriving on our shores to take over from the saturnine Avram Grant, Big Phil might have been mistaken for Brazil's ambassador to London. He had read all his briefing papers about the cliques and the turmoil of the Mourinho-Grant years and was intent on instilling unity and calm. But then it hit him: the whirlwind of fixtures, the endless churn of headlines, the crowd volatility, the sheer relentlessness of problem-solving at the top of the English game. Under this bombardment he acquired an ominously robotic look as his vision of liberating Chelsea's creativity began to look like a bad case of meddling with a fixed identity. Some will think it a mark of shame for the game in this country that a World Cup\u2013winning coach can be crushed like this after 25 league games. Scolari went faster than an England batsman in the West Indies and Chelsea have now worked their way through four managers in five years. Claudio Ranieri is coaching Juventus, Chelsea's next Champions League opponents, and Jose Mourinho is steering Internazionale to more success. Scolari plunged into the inferno within seven months. Some would say the problem is with the club, not the A-list managers who say yes to the task of reconciling Roman Abramovich's whims with the commercial cravings of the board and assorted in-house factions, who seldom seem to be holding a single hymn sheet. The first signs of Scolari's disorientation came with the home defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal. The Stamford Bridge fortress was ransacked in the autumn and was no longer a house of pain for visiting sides. Mourinho's teams would bulldoze their guests into the net and then assume a position of impregnability while the clock ran down. Scolari arrived with grander visions. The Chelsea hierarchy assumed Brazilian self-expression could be welded onto the old defensive solidity to form an unbeatable whole. The league champions of 2005 and 2006 would start playing like Manchester United and Arsenal and Abramovich, the absentee landlord, would be enticed back from the art galleries to which his new love had lured him. \"Overlapping full-backs\" became standard dinner party conversational fare. With the newly arrived Jose Bosingwa on the right and Ashley Cole on the left, Chelsea would prance along the flanks in a formation lifted largely from Scolari's 2002 World Cup-winning side. It seemed impolite to point out that the world champions of seven years ago could call on Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, rather than Florent Malouda and Salomon Kalou. The spirit of adventure was free at last. The beatings administered to Portsmouth (4-0, in both the league and the Carling Cup), Middlesbrough and Sunderland (both 5-0 victories) were seen as proof that Chelsea were developing an Ipanema mind-set. Three months on from the last of those thumping wins we see another pay-off, another thank-you-and-goodnight statement that places Scolari in the same burning boat as Tony Adams, a veteran of 16 league matches at Portsmouth and sacked on the same day. Intense and sober novices, kings of the football world: the Premier League can dispense with both on a rainy day in February. In Chelsea's favour is the sense that Scolari never really settled in the Stamford Bridge dug-out. Managing Brazil doubtless inflicted suffocating pressure. But only in short bursts. Here it seemed to come every day. Chelsea gained exuberance but lost resilience. At the Bridge, visitors found it increasingly easy to negate wing-back play. Without the injured or dropped Didier Drogba to smash a path, Chelsea would bounce off a wall. Away games afforded greater space in which to elaborate, but as the side began to toil in December Scolari became ever more querulous, picking fights with referees and fretting about yellow cards. Noises off-stage included suggestions of disquiet about Scolari's training regime (an old chestnut, when results are deteriorating), and tactical grumblings about the lack of an alternative strategy: the fabled Plan B. One senior player confided recently that Steve Clarke's departure to West Ham United to work with Gianfranco Zola was a mighty setback for the club. \"Steve gave us our shape, took control of a lot of the basics,\" he said. \"Losing him was a big blow.\" Another theory gaining ground throughout the club was that Scolari inherited a side at the end of a winning cycle, and was denied the funds to rebuild it. Unlike at Manchester United and Arsenal, there is no reviving wave of youth to splash across the first-team squad. Scolari brought Bosingwa and Deco from Iberia but a throng of also-rans from the Mourinho years were allowed to stay and stagnate. Attention shifts therefore to the management of the club, to youth recruitment, to Abramovich's absences and to factionalism. Then there is the problem recently pointed out by Sir Bobby Charlton, that \"Chelsea change their managers too often\" to achieve coherence and stability. Scolari did not have time to swing for a journalist, punch an opposition player or get anywhere near a trophy. The cabaret never quite happened because a fine international manager with a good pedigree in South American club football fell into the vortex when his team were fourth in the table, just seven points behind United. That counts as a crisis these days. There is no known cure for this hysteria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
