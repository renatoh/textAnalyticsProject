Hearn was typically ready to talk expansively about the performance and his certainty that Joshua, whom he promotes, will fight Tyson Fury next year. But, first, he savoured the \u201cunbelievable\u201d encounter he had just witnessed between Joshua and Floyd Mayweather Jr. \u201cThey talked tactics for about an hour,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cThey were talking about slipping jabs, using elbows in a clinch, it just went on and on. Mayweather loved the fight [between Joshua and Pulev]. He was screaming the whole time: \u2018Jab, jab, stay on the outside, beautiful, beautiful.\u2019 \u201cIt was fascinating because all fighters are in awe of Mayweather. AJ was just bleeding information out of him about slipping jabs. He is a student of the game. AJ is like a sponge. Any information he can draw out of people, he loves it. He saw that conversation as so valuable.\u201d Robert McCracken, Joshua\u2019s trainer, had come out a little earlier for a chat. He is as understated as Hearn is voluble. Had McCracken known Mayweather would be a surprise guest at the fight? \u201cI got a call this morning so I knew he was going to turn up. He\u2019s a mate of Josh\u2019s and they\u2019ve been friends for a long time.\u201d McCracken paused when asked if he was worried that the presence of Mayweather, as great a hustler outside the ring as he was a fighter between the ropes, may distract Joshua. \u201cMaybe four or five years ago, but Josh is very driven. He\u2019s happy-go-lucky on the outside but he\u2019s deadly serious about boxing.\u201d That consuming drive was obvious against Pulev as Joshua produced a performance McCracken described as \u201cone of his best\u201d. The trainer added: \u201cHe showed his experience and stayed calm. Pulev is very experienced and he\u2019s dangerous. Josh tried to finish him off [in the third round when Pulev took two counts], realised he wasn\u2019t ready to go and then just regrouped, got his breath back and found his range and distance in the next round. Then he broke Pulev down. And Pulev\u2019s a top fighter. He had only lost to [Wladimir] Klitschko in his whole career.\u201d McCracken soon turned his attention to Joshua\u2019s next fight, which is likely to be the long-awaited showdown with Fury. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Josh is in heavyweight boxing \u2013 to fight the best. Him and Tyson Fury are the two best heavyweights. \u201cIt\u2019s when they fight \u2013 not if. I wouldn\u2019t have thought they would wait. I think they will definitely fight, and at least twice. That\u2019s what everybody wants to happen. You can\u2019t not let the fans see two great heavyweights go against each other, especially when they are British. So 100% they will box each other, and it will be a huge challenge for both fighters. I know Tyson and he\u2019s a fantastic fighter.\u201d Hearn was asked about the expectation that each champion will make more than \u00a3100m when they meet in the ring. \u201cIt depends where it is, but that\u2019s the kind of number both fighters expect for a fight like this. But you wouldn\u2019t get near that number in the UK \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. That\u2019s why I say we agree a deal and then we all go out collectively to the market and present the fighters with the offers. \u201cThe only way we get to 50% of the money in the UK is if we get a 100% capacity crowd back. It was so good having 1,000 fans in the arena. It felt like 90,000. But the government could close it all down again in January. London could go to tier three next week.\u201d It seems inevitable the bout will take place in the Middle East and Hearn said a two-fight deal has been agreed between the two camps. \u201cEveryone is completely in on the finances \u2013 50-50 for the first fight, 60-40 to the winner in the second. We just need to sign an agreement and then go into a conversation about the various sites. That\u2019s what they did for Fury-[Deontay] Wilder \u2013 signed the fight and then went to see where they could get the money.\u201d In a battle to decide the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Joshua will defend his IBF, WBA and WBO belts while Fury enters the ring as the WBC champion. Hearn confirmed that the WBO may insist instead on Joshua defending their title against Oleksandr Usyk first. But his response was blunt: \u201cIf the WBO don\u2019t want to be involved in the biggest fight in boxing then unfortunately we would have to vacate the title. It would be a travesty because all we want, and all boxing needs, is an undisputed heavyweight champion. \u201cAll these governing bodies have a rule that basically says: \u2018We can do whatever we want.\u2019 So they need to allow this fight to happen. Coming off the pandemic, this is the shot in the arm the sport needs. AJ is just different. He transcends everything \u2013 sexes, ages, religions, countries, and that is the only way we are going to grow boxing. Not many people can do it. So if the WBO don\u2019t want to be involved in this fight then we will have to speak to Mr Usyk and see if we can work that out.\u201d Hearn spoke further about the insidious control that sanctioning bodies exert over boxing. \u201cWe all love a pound note but my God! I had a picture with Mayweather and his belts and I said: \u2018How much did you pay them in your career?\u2019 He was like ... [Hearn pulls a dismayed face]. There will come a time in boxing when we look at that. AJ wants to fight for the undisputed championship. It would take a little away for AJ [should the WBO refuse to sanction the fight] but we would still do it.\u201d As for the fight itself, Hearn said: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt confident, and styles make fights. I think AJ will knock him out. Tonight AJ got hit once with a right hand and that was about it. Fury and Pulev probably punch as hard as each other. But Fury is a lot better than Pulev. \u201cIt should be the toughest fight out there, as it is an undisputed fight. Fury is at the peak of his powers and so is AJ, which is why it will be so great if we get it made.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
