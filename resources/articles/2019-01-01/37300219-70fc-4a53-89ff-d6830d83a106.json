He could hear his opposite number effing and blinding in the other technical area, swearing at everything and nothing as managers do, and thought he would try a mild interjection of his own. \u201cSean Dyche was on the touchline: \u2018Fucking this, fucking that\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAt one moment I turned to him and said: \u2018Fuck off, Sean. Hey, Sean: fuck off\u2019.\u201d Pochettino\u2019s own staff let him know that he had gone in a little too strong and he quickly apologised. \u201cI thought I was saying: \u2018Shut up\u2019, he says, explaining that he had the Spanish expletive hijo de puta, which carries slightly less impact, in mind at the time. It is not the kind of mistake you make twice and Pochettino, who reached the sixth anniversary of his time in England on Friday, rarely wants for clarity these days. He believes he has developed every aspect of his being since \u2013 with the persuasion of his wife, Karina, and assistant Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez \u2013 he accepted the former Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese\u2019s offer to join the south-coast club in 2013. \u201cI think [I\u2019ve made a] massive improvement,\u201d he says. \u201cI learn a lot; I hope to learn more. I think we discovered a different culture, a different country, [which was] so far [away that] it was impossible for me to know how you live, how you feel, how is your culture. I think personally and professionally it is a massive improvement.\u201d On Sunday afternoon his Tottenham side visit Fulham and it is another chance to show that the sense of advancement has worked both ways. What few people knew about Pochettino when he arrived on these shores was the extent to which he is a developmental coach, a manager who believes in improving his existing resources rather than stockpiling more. \u201cOf course, you always need money because it\u2019s going to help you,\u201d he says. \u201cBut football is about chapters, periods, projects: you need to say: \u2018I want to achieve that after three years, that after five years, that after 10 years.\u2019 And not all the people have that open mind to be patient and back that kind of project. \u201cIt\u2019s like now at Tottenham, because we suffer the injury to Harry Kane and Son [Heung-min] was going to the Asian Cup [people say] we need to change our philosophy. No! Now is the time to be stronger and to believe in the strategy. If we\u2019re scared of the circumstance, we\u2019re going to lose. If we puff out our chest and are positive, we can take an amazing chance to show we are a real team that is going to open the door for young players in the academy. But if we change the strategy because of the circumstance, we are going to fail for sure in the long term.\u201d That is essentially why Kane will be replaced in-house at Fulham, with Dele Alli a contender to play the false-nine role and the academy forward Kazaiah Sterling in line for a place on the bench. Pochettino believes the merit of tapping into the person behind the footballer is underestimated in coaching and puts special emphasis on the need not to treat players like two-dimensional cut-outs. \u201cIt\u2019s [about] spending time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can spend time analysing your opponents, or you can spend time analysing opponents and giving your time to these young people, the players in your squad, to try to understand how they think, how they live, what they need. Then, if you really know these people, you can provide better tools to improve and be better and to help in their development. \u201cThe worst thing as a human being is to underestimate the people in front of you. You always need to think that the people in front of you are the most clever people.\u201d Pochettino was steeped in the blood and thunder of the Argentinian league, which was a no-holds-barred environment on and off the pitch when he emerged as a player with Newell\u2019s Old Boys in the early 1990s. It is perhaps why he speaks with so much feeling about the need to balance passion and technocracy. \u201cThe key point, as it was for Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, is man management,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, human skills are going to be the most important. And then we are talking about technology, machines, data: they don\u2019t feel anything. They are like the furniture. We are talking about the real human. We need to breathe, we need to feel the love, we need emotion. Football is a contest of emotion. If we forget that, we are going to kill the game.\u201d The suspicion is that, verbal volleys or not, Dyche would have agreed with him that afternoon in Burnley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
