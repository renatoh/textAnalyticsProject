Hollywood is now trying to figure out what went wrong. It is certainly a conundrum. Unlike last summer's crummy The Da Vinci Code, which garnered harsh reviews and poor word-of-mouth because of a meandering script, Ron Howard's slovenly direction, and ill-advised casting, no one believes that Flags Of Our Fathers fell flat because the film itself is a dud. Though the revered if somewhat overrated septuagenarian director had made a few clinkers in the past few years (Space Cowboys, Blood Work, True Crime, Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil), he had recently come back strong with Mystic River and Million-Dollar Baby, both of which won Oscars. The only legitimate criticism of Eastwood's latest endeavour lay in the casting; Flags has no major stars, a decision partially made to hold down costs, but also made to emphasise the very anonymity of the soldiers, who have not entered American mythology as individuals, but merely as components of a sainted ensemble. Eastwood may now be having second thoughts, wishing he had opened the vault for Johnny Depp or Matt Damon. Promiscuously hyped long before its release, and generally greeted with slobbering reviews by the legions of accommodating bozos who masquerade as film critics in America, Flags Of Our Fathers tells the story of three United States Marines who planted the American flag atop Mount Suribachi during the siege of Iwo Jima in February 1945, resulting in one of the most immortal photographs in the nation's history. Though no one has ever denied that the photo is a retake (the flag in the first shot was deemed too small by the top brass) the image is as celebrated in American folklore as George Washington crossing the Delaware River on Christmas Eve 1776, or George Armstrong Custer perishing at the Little Big Horn exactly 100 years later. There is even a gigantic statue in Washington that captures the image in bronze, and it is by no means an unpopular tourist attraction. Yet by and large, the American public voted with its feet when Flags Of Our Fathers was released. Either they stayed home, or they went to see Cambridge-educated Jackass Goes To Kazakhstan, or a movie about Beantown psychopaths, or a film about convivial penguins. Eastwood's thoughtful film they could do without. Because the USA is now mired in a war it appears to have no chance of winning, Eastwood may have picked the worst possible moment to make this film. There is a good chance that Americans on the left are avoiding the film because they mistakenly believe it is a flag-waving venture, while people on the right are avoiding it because America is losing the war in Iraq, and Flags reminds them of a time when America didn't lose wars. Despite the muted response to Flags, it isn't terribly hard to see why expectations for the film were so high. It is based on a very popular book and follows on the heels of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, a monstrously successful paean to second world war heroes, which then spawned Spielberg's Band Of Brothers, a revered television series that was also based on a massive bestseller. It arrives just a few years after Pearl Harbor, a major money-maker which also dealt with the war in the Pacific. Moreover, its path was laid smooth by news anchor Tom Brokaw's beloved book The Greatest Generation, a tribute to the men who defeated Adolf Hitler and Colonel Tojo. Brokaw's book was a nice tip of the hat to folks born in the 1920s, who are now rapidly dying out, and even though its factually indefensible premise was thoughtlessly disrespectful to Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S Grant and co, an awful lot of people bought copies. So why did Flags not become a massive hit while Borat did? I have a theory. Around 25 years ago, I attended a brilliant film festival in New York, which consisted of the very first motion pictures to flop in genres that had previously produced an unbroken string of hits. The lineup included Orca: The Killer Whale, which did not duplicate the success of Jaws; Cooley High, which did not match the success of Assault On Precinct 13; and The Yakuza, a gangster movie set in Japan that had zero appeal to fans of gangster movies. Some of these films were atrocious, and some were merely passable, but Orca, starring Richard Harris as a doomed fisherman engaged in a vendetta with a persistent killer whale, was actually amazingly entertaining. The reason it failed was not because it was especially preposterous or stupid; it failed because the genre was tapped out. This may also be the case with Flags Of Our Fathers. First, Hollywood paid tribute to the men who died at Normandy. Then it paid tribute to the men who died at Pearl Harbor. Then it made a side trip to Iraq with Three Kings and Jarhead. But by the time Clint Eastwood got around to paying tribute to the men who fell on Iwo Jima, movie audiences were getting emotionally worn out by all this patriotic gore. Moreover, the young people who go to movie theatres today are going to have a hard time relating to a battle that took place 61 years ago; this isn't Flags of Our Fathers, it's Flags of Our Grandfathers. One final note: Eastwood's film largely deals with the American government's ruthless exploitation of three unlikely war heroes in order to raise money for a war the public was sick of. Bad, bad timing, Clint. \u00b7 Flags Of Our Fathers is out on Dec 22"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
