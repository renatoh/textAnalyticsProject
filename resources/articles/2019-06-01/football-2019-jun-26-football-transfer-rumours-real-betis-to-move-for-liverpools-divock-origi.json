The central midfielder has long been linked with a move to White Hart Lane and it seems Pochettino joined him on a guided tour of the swanky stadium, possibly gave him one of those pints that are poured through the bottom of the glass and convinced him Spurs could win the Premier League next season. A club record fee of anything between \u00a360m and \u00a375m is being mooted for the 22-year-old, depending on where you get your news. Tottenham are also so close to signing Jack Clarke that some over-enthusiastic busybody has already confirmed the news of the \u00a38m deal on the 18-year-old Leeds winger\u2019s Wikipedia page. And determined to hog the headlines in today\u2019s Rumour Mill after two windows of well-documented inactivity, Tottenham are also in the market for teenage St \u00c9tienne central defender William Saliba, but will have to fight off interest from Arsenal, who have already had a \u00a327m offer for the player\u2019s services rejected. With Manchester United reported to be unwilling to budge so much as an inch on their demand of \u00a3150m for Paul Pogba, the French midfielder\u2019s chief suitors, Real Madrid, could take their business elsewhere. Marca claim Madrid may try to sign Donny van de Beek from Ajax, in news that comes towards the end of a month in which the 22-year-old has already been linked with their chief rivals Barcelona. Meanwhile in Italy, Napoli are interested in signing James Rodr\u00edguez, one of several high-profile players deemed surplus to requirements at the Bernab\u00e9u. Sevilla\u2019s French striker Wissam Ben Yedder is the latest player to crop up on United\u2019s summer shopping list, according to France Football. Also rumoured to have turned heads at PSG and Barcelona, the 28-year-old who scored 30 goals in 54 games for his club last season has a \u00a336m release clause in his contract. German tabloid Bild say Bayern Munich are unhappy with the apparent lack of enthusiasm with which Manchester City winger Leroy San\u00e9 is greeting their overtures and may turn their focus to Barcelona\u2019s Ousman\u00e9 Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 instead. No stranger to the Bundesliga, the 22-year-old made his name at Borussia Dortmund but has often underwhelmed since his move to the Camp Nou despite scoring several crucial goals . Currently without a club after being released by West Ham at the end of the season, Samir Nasri could be off to the United Arab Emirates to play for Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC, who have offered to pay him \u00a33.6m per year. The high maintenance 31-year-old is believed to have had no shortage of lucrative, if fairly uninspiring offers and has already turned down moves to the A-League with Western United, Olympiacos in Greece and at least one Ligue 1 side. Still at West Ham but eager to leave, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez is hoping to find a new home in Spain. Real Betis are in the market for a new striker, but want Liverpool\u2019s Belgian super-sub Divock Origi. And finally, reports from the Netherlands say Liverpool have been successful in their attempt to sign 17-year-old central defender Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle in the face of competition from fellow suitors Ajax, Bayern Munich and PSV Eindhoven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
