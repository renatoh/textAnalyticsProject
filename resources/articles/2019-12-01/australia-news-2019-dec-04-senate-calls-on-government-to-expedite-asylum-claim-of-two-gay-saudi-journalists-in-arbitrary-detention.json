Guardian Australia can reveal that multiple news organisations around the world have called for the release of the men, warning the Australian government they are watching the case closely. The motion, brought by Greens senator Janet Rice, also urged the government to expedite the refugee assessment process for the couple and assure their safety in the interim. Labor, Centre Alliance and independent senator Jacqui Lambie all pledged their support for the motion, which passed on Wednesday afternoon. Last month Guardian Australia revealed the two men were detained at an Australian airport after passing through immigration on valid tourist visas. They have remained in detention or under guard in hospital ever since, and have alleged threats of violence against them as well as fear they could be targeted by Saudi representatives. Sultan* is a former ministry of media employee and a fixer who had worked with multiple international media organisations, and Nassar* is a cameraman. They fled their home country after Sultan was interrogated by Saudi authorities, who ordered him to stop working with foreign media and made veiled threats to out his and his partner\u2019s relationship. Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and punishable by death. Sultan told Guardian Australia last month their arrest and \u201carbitrary\u201d detention in Australia was comparable to threats back home. \u201cWe\u2019ve been threatened with it in Saudi but it never actually happened until we came here,\u201d he said. Rice welcomed the Senate\u2019s move. \u201cWhen these journalists liken their treatment in Saudi to the violence they have experienced here in Australia, it should be a wake-up call,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe government should act swiftly to reflect the view of the Senate on this matter and uphold the values of fairness and diversity that our country says we stand for.\u201d \u201cThis motion is an important step to increased public awareness of how dangerous Australian immigration detention centres are,\u201d said the men\u2019s lawyer, Alison Battisson. \u201cI am aware of serious assaults, requiring hospitalisation, taking place on a weekly basis \u2026 When assaults do occur, it appears very difficult for the Australian federal police to access detention to investigate.\u201d Several international media organisations have also written to Australia\u2019s immigration minister, David Coleman, in support of the men. \u201cThis is unjust treatment of two journalists who travelled to Australia seeking protection from the persecution they faced as gay men in Saudi Arabia,\u201d wrote one letter from Mark MacKinnon, of Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail. \u201cI hope you can intervene to ensure they are released from detention \u2013 they have valid visas to visit Australia \u2013 so that they can pursue their asylum claim,\u201d he said.\u201d \u201cPlease trust that I and my colleagues around the world who know and have worked with [Sultan] will be watching the outcome of this process with very keen interest.\u201d Other letters from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious newsrooms, including the BBC and ITN, urged Coleman to grant the pair asylum, saying the pair would \u201cfit in very well in Australia\u201d. Michael Garrod, the founder of freelancer database, World Fixer, said Sultan was driven to help foreign media \u201cin the spirit of progress, driven and inspired by the initiatives of the Crown Prince\u201d, and said if the couple was returned to Saudi Arabia they faced persecution because of both their sexuality and their profession. \u201cI sincerely hope that your department recognises their considerable contribution to our global understanding of their country and stands by Australia\u2019s promise to support LGBT rights globally,\u201d he said. Peter Greste, journalist and spokesman for the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom, said: \u201cIf Australia wants to be seen as a campaigner of press freedom around the world, and wants to be respected and taken seriously, the government will act swiftly, and with understanding and compassion, in relation to these two journalists.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
