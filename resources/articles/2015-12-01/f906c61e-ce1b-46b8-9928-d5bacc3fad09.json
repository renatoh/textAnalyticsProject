Have a brilliant final! I\u2019m at @jnraeside if you need any tips on removing excess oil from your hands. On the basis of that task, the worst person by a hundred miles was Richard, closely followed by Charleine. He must like both of their business plans. So with five wazzocks to go, it\u2019s time for the interviews. \u201cFantastic,\u201d says Bret. I\u2019ve not heard that reaction before. Alan reassures him that he\u2019s an honourable man which is lovely coming from Alan. He lets the others go and Charleine is already in tears as she thanks him. I think it\u2019ll be more than one person. But who? WHO? Gary, Charleine, Bret and Richard nod passively yet confidently as Alan begins the dance of doom. And the loser is...Bret. Bret barely draws breath before Alan bashes him down for letting Richard dominate him. Bret says he\u2019s always the first person to say, \u201cGuys\u201d. Every team needs a person who can says guys. Right guys? The marked four return to the boardroom and Char is first to defend herself. She recaps her entire time on the show, flagging up sales figures. Gary goes next and talks a lot without saying anything at all. Richard reminds us he\u2019s won 8 out of 9 tasks and made 4 million billion quid on property last week. Anyone can do that in London, mate. That\u2019s how Alan got rich. Karrrren speaks up for Charleine in a backhanded way and says that she has fallen apart today but she never gives up. Charleine can\u2019t decide who to bring back but eventually picks Gary because she\u2019s panicking and Alan is nagging her. Joseph goes back to the house. Bret finally sees sense and says he will bring back Richard. Vana and Joseph are safe and will get to show Alan their business plans. The others look afraid/sad/flatulent. Bret is finally under the spotlight for not understanding the concept behind his own product. While Richard claims he wasn\u2019t told how the crisps were made, Bret tries to be noble and says he won\u2019t rip into a colleague for the sake of it. Save yourself, Bret. Ditch Single White Male over there and finger him for this. Charleine goes outside for a cry. The others carry on without her. No, she\u2019s back again explaining that her tears are for the poor quality for the product. Even though she made it. Just her. It was definitely NOT her fault. Gary, Charleine and Joseph are ribbed for their claims. She is crying. Perhaps she finally feels bad for claiming that her revolting snack might cure cancer. Back in the boardroom, things are no clearer. This isn\u2019t a nil-nil draw, says Alan because they all lost. Nice logic. The two PMs will be brought back with one team member each for the final reckoning. Sack them all sack them all sack them all sack them all. They all leave in oily disgrace. He could fire all of them and we could call this the final. Vana knows the oil was a big factor in her product not selling but she throws interference towards Richard\u2019s \u201craw\u201d error. Gary shuffles the blame towards Charleine and they all sit in the sad cafe thinking about champagne cocktails at the top of Tower 42. Wowsers trousers - literally not one sale for either team. The result they all dreaded and we all hoped for. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened before\u201d says Alan like a man embarrassed in a love situation. We\u2019ve waited a while folks but here it is. Alan\u2019s big drop-kick this week is a line about an iconic vegetable being Elvis Parsley. Let\u2019s all bow our heads and think about Syria for a bit to cheer ourselves up. Gary reiterates his seven GREAT years at the major supermarket chain but neglects to tell us why he left. We\u2019ll gloss over it. The crisp team tenses up as Alan opens a packet of their onion \u201ccrisps\u201d. To be fair, the global environmental disaster that spills out is ridiculous. Alan\u2019s pudgy fingers are all greasy and I can\u2019t help but think of sausages. Gary explains the crossings out on his packaging. Charleine looks and sounds like she\u2019s already given up. Did Alan just nick my Chernobyl joke? The bloody cheek! Karrren gleefully corrects all of Char\u2019s pronunciations of the super food ingredients. Rich from a woman who can\u2019t even spell Karen. Outside the boardroom, Charleine seems to be actually praying. Alan\u2019s \u201cgood morning\u201d is directed at the floor in front of him. Bad shit is coming. You can just tell. Did they all sell nothing? I bet they all sold nothing. Who does Joseph look like? I\u2019ve never been able to nail it down. Yer man out of Sparks? No. Who? Gary faces his former employers to flog Rejuvenate. Imagine the inside of Gary\u2019s head right now. They ask him to sum up the benefit of their product in one line. It\u2019s energy, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s vibrant, says Gary looking like a disappointed Anton du Beke. The black crisps look like Chernobyl. Bret says the product is \u201cvegan free\u201d. No vegans were harmed in the making of this product. So the word \u201craw\u201d seems to be important here. Nowhere on the bag does it say that the crisps aren\u2019t baked they\u2019re dehydrated. Who decided to remove \u201craw\u201d from the bag? I think it was Richard. Or it could have been Bret because they are the SAME PERSON. Vana gushes \u201cI am in love with this product\u201d as they enter their next pitch. \u201cThere is 50% olive oil in this product\u201d says Richard flatly as the panel sink their gums into the sludge oil slivers inside the bags. I\u2019ve spelt Rejuvenate wrong down there haven\u2019t I? So fire me. Joseph tries to explain to Char that they can\u2019t lie in the pitches but she urges positivity above all else. Let\u2019s see how this goes at Asda. She madly patronises the Asda buyers about super foods. Her eyes nearly pop out of her head. Gary throws to Joseph to pass on the results of their market research. He is digging and digging. You can buy this Rejuvinate bar in the morning, the afternoon. Literally any of those two times. Charleine says the first pitch was so so. There were things they weren\u2019t keen on - the name, the packaging, the idea in general. The Virgin Active man points out that excess of oil again. He really shouldn\u2019t have put his hands straight in his hair after touching the crisps. Bret and his team arrive at the Virgin Active pitch wearing ties to match the carpet. Good start. They really are the same person aren\u2019t they? Richard and Bret. Same ties, suits, beards, hand gestures. They\u2019re starting to creep me out. Karrren points out that they have a \u201cfew problems\u201d. Does she mean the packets covered in magic marker or the disgusting tripe within? Hard to pick just one. The first pitch is to Holland &amp; Barrat. Charleine uses the phrase \u201chealth cautious\u201d early on and the corners of the panel\u2019s mouths start to curl. They try her awful bars and say they don\u2019t like them. She starts free-styling about them warding off cancer. The crisp gang do some market research and get the feedback \u201ca little bit oily\u201d. A little bit?! You could rub them on your skin on holiday or before a massage. Charleine, Gary and Joseph have to start crossing words off their packaging as they\u2019ve made false claims about antioxidants. The terrified snack bar floggers stagger out of the front door clutching easels and executive cases, looking like scared children. It\u2019s 8am and the advertising material has arrived. The crisp merchants seem to have done well and they proclaim the product tasty. The pomegranate and peppermint bars sound utterly disgusting. Charleine just said \u201cfuck\u201d. Charleine is panicking. She is angrily listing the ingredients and not listening to the boys at all. The boys do what they can with the vaguest of terms on their packaging. They might as well put \u201cnice\u201d and just hope for the best. Bret is clenching furiously as Vana also decides to play fast and loose with the measurements. She pours so much olive oil into the mix you can actually tip a packet of these crisps into your car\u2019s engine if it\u2019s not running smoothly. Charleine has Karrren watching her like a hawk. It\u2019s just the two of them. Imagine the pressure. It is becoming clear that the pressure has started to get to her and her snack bars could possibly kill someone. Claude observes that the power structure of Bret\u2019s team is all out of cock. Not his words, mine. Charleine hurls in acai berry extract like it\u2019s going out of fashion. She doesn\u2019t believe in weighing scales. She has no idea what her health bar will do. It could be a George\u2019s Marvelous Medicine situation here. Enormous, oversizes grandparents all over the country, furiously launching legal action on the BBC. Sorry, did Bret just call a tomato a \u201ctomaydo\u201d? I\u2019m sorry, is he an American or is he trying to ingratiate himself with Vana? Herring &amp; Pistachio. See? Not hard. Vana and co have actually gone for veggie crisps. They definitely already exist so are they just going to invent a quirk flavour combination because that doesn\u2019t seem so hard. Charleine says their product will be great for contraception. Charleine needs to go back to school immediately. Joseph and Gary are back at base. She enthuses about baoba. Or booba, or baabaa. They want to make a Rejuvinate bar infused with nature\u2019s viagra. Is that a Rejuvinate bar in your pocket etc? Charleine goes to explore super foods and listens to the patter of an \u201cexpert\u201d who talks her through the magical powers of some coloured powders in jars. She swallows it all whole. Joseph fires off some names and suggests LIFE. Charleine asks him to spell it. Sweet lord above. Gary, who just pointed out he\u2019ll be pitching to his old boss, says crisps are a big seller but I think they opted for an energy bar because we all skip meals nowadays. God, how depressing. Look at them all, in their people carriers, in their suits, eating their cereal bars. I want to cry. Richard wants to change the way we eat lunch. Charleine puts herself forward to PM the task because she eats snack bars. Siper. Brett takes charge of the other team because he goes to the gym. Richard says he\u2019ll take control of his own sub team of one because this is very much his thing. Has he just handed Bret the PM role so someone else is in the firing line when it all goes wrong? I think yes. We are at the Olympic Park because the challenge is HEALTH related. They got quite desperate with the tenuous meet-ups this series didn\u2019t they? Sack that producer. Vana reminds her team that they are the best as they all fluff up their chest feathers in preparation for some Alan time by the pool. Again, none of them are dressed appropriately. No cozzies. Was that Joseph in his pants? The candidates must meet Alan at the Olympic Park quite near my house. If I\u2019d have known they were so close by I\u2019d have literally moved to America. The recap reminds us of Selina\u2019s total loss of voice. She just erm-ed a lot. Meanwhile, Vana made four billion million pounds in the property game and Scott stormed off. As Selina got into that taxi, it strikes me, did she ask for a white suitcase to coordinate with her mac? Because usually they\u2019re black. I bet she did. A quarter OF a million pound investment. How many more times? \u201cThings take an unexpected turn...\u201d says the continuity lady. Maybe they ARE doing it in costume. What about a panto episode? Could the Lord become a dame for the night? I\u2019d pay to see that. It seems wrong somehow, The Apprentice being on at Christmas. It\u2019s like Scrooge and a boardroom full of Cratchetts, killing my holly buzz with their acquisitive buffoonery. Actually, the least they could have done is performed the final in full Dickensian costume. Are we gathered in? Have you stocked up on goji berry smoothies and quinoa boost bars? And alcohol? You go away for a week and all hell breaks loose. I can\u2019t believe I missed the unthroning of Selina and Scott\u2019s turbo-flounce to boot. Sadly, this is my last blog of the series but the passionate, 110% committed Hannah Verdier will be taking it to the bridge for next week\u2019s interview round and the final on Sunday 19th. That\u2019s right, don\u2019t go tuning in on the following Wednesday because you\u2019ll miss the big climax. Tonight the remaining six are challenged to invent a healthy snack food, brand it, market it and sell it to three major retailers. The gossip suggests that it turns into an unholy (low calorie) bun fight and the boardroom in particular is thrown into disarray. Can\u2019t wait. Join me here shortly before 9pm to witness the fitness. Or witness the witless, if we\u2019re talking accuracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
