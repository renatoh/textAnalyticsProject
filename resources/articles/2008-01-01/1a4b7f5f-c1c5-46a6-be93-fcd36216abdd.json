Women who have already had breast cancer and are in remission and those whose mother, sister or other close relative has had the disease should be referred promptly to a specialist if they arrive at the GP surgery with concerns, say guidelines from the National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence (Nice). But a survey of 200 GPs by the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer found that many family doctors did not prioritise these groups of women. It found that 10% of GPs treat a suspect lump in the breast of a woman who has had a previous breast cancer as a routine case rather than making an urgent referral to a consultant. A third of GPs (34%) would also treat routinely a woman under the age of 30 who had found a lump in her breast and who had a family history of the disease. In both sets of circumstances, the woman should be referred as an urgent case to a hospital specialist, according to Nice, and should be seen within two weeks under government guidelines. Jeremy Hughes, the chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, described the survey results as \"surprising\". \"If you go to your GP and the GP says, 'Well there may be something of concern here [but] it may not be very important,' you don't go away and forget about it, you go away and worry,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The older a woman gets, the higher her chances of developing breast cancer. Four out of five cases are diagnosed in women aged 50 or over. But the survey found that only 16% of family doctors \"proactively\" talk to female patients aged over 50 about the importance of breast awareness and the signs and symptoms of breast cancer. Among these cases, the patients initiated 80% of the conversations. A small number of GPs (6%) surveyed by the charity think it is inappropriate to talk to a patient over 70 to let her know that she can still request a free breast screening appointment. Last September, Gordon Brown announced that all patients, and not just those needing urgent attention, should be referred to a specialist for breast problems and be seen within two weeks of referral. Hughes told the Today programme: \"We know some women referred routinely to a specialist go on to be diagnosed with breast cancer and for any woman, waiting to hear whether or not they have breast cancer is an extremely stressful and worrying time. \"While we welcome the government commitment to implement this by December 2009, some areas of the country have already achieved a maximum two-week wait and we urge the NHS to ensure all areas are supported to achieve this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
