The 27-year-old second-rower, who was also fined \u00a3300, will not be free to start playing again until the fourth round of the Challenge Cup in April. Westwood was placed on report by the Australian referee Jason Robinson for the challenge on Carlaw during the Wolves' 40-20 home defeat by Catalans Dragons in a feisty match at the Halliwell Jones Stadium on Saturday. He was subsequently charged with a Grade D tackle and admitted the offence when he appeared before tonight's Rugby Football League disciplinary committee. It was the second major blow for the Wolves in 24 hours as they seek to end a run of seven consecutive defeats going back to last August. They look like being without new signing Garreth Carvell, the former Hull prop, for a lengthy period after he damaged knee ligaments on his home debut. Meanwhile Manly have become the first Australian club to support British proposals for the World Club Challenge to be expanded into a Champions League \u2013 less than a week after their chief executive described the Super League as \"a second-tier competition\". Leeds Rhinos, who face the Sea Eagles at Elland Road on Sunday night aiming to become the first team to retain the world club title, proposed after their victory over Melbourne Storm last year that the concept should be developed into a series of matches between the top three from each hemisphere. Any momentum that idea might have developed seemed to have been cut short by England's woeful performances in last autumn's World Cup. But Grant Mayer, the Manly chief executive who previously played a key role in laying the foundations for Catalans Dragons' entry into the Super League in 2006, believes Australian clubs should take it seriously. \"Because of my background in France I've got a passion for the Super League, and I believe that the idea from last year of getting the top two or three sides together from each country and playing in a tournament has got some credibility,\" he said in Leeds, after watching the Manly players enjoy a training session in pleasant spring sunshine. \"The top two or three sides in Super League could match it with NRL clubs \u2013 it's improved that much in the last few years. We've got to get like a Champions League. The game itself has got so insular with just Australia, New Zealand, England and France. The rugby league fan wants to see some more of those international games. The difficult thing is finding a place in the schedule when it can happen.\" Mayer also qualified his \"second tier\" comments, insisting that he had been referring to the way the Super League is perceived by Australian players rather than the quality of the competition itself. Leeds have conceded that they will be without Danny Buderus, the Australian hooker who suffered a knee cartilage injury in the Rhinos' recent victory over Wakefield, which was his first appearance since rupturing a bicep last August. The 31-year-old will now be out for at least a month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
