The unanimous decision reduced expectations of lower rates, which the market had priced in for later this year. The widely expected decision marked the fifth consecutive meeting that rates were left unchanged at 5.25%, following 17 consecutive quarter-point rises in the two years up until June. In the statement accompanying the announcement, the Fed said that although inflation had improved slightly and pressures were likely to moderate, they were still wary of risks that could push inflation higher. While markets are still hoping for at least one cut this year, the Fed held out the possibility of raising rates to deal with price pressures. \"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,\" it said. Data out yesterday showed that core inflation eased in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 2.1% from 2.2%. Policymakers fear the fall may only be temporary - inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Yesterday's government data showed a rebound in annualised economic growth to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of last year from a modest 2% in the previous quarter. Recent figures on the housing market have also been relatively benign following fears of a slump last year. But economists warned that the healthy data was simply a temporary boost due to a sharp decline in energy prices and a warm winter. Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, said: \"We remain convinced that growth will slow sharply this year as the housing slump begins to have a more pronounced impact.\" Separately, in a speech on the US economy, President George Bush complained about the size of executives' pay packages, which have grown even faster in the US in recent years than in Britain. He said. \"Government should not decide the compensation ... But the salaries and bonuses of CEOs should be based on their success at improving their companies and bringing value to their shareholders.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
