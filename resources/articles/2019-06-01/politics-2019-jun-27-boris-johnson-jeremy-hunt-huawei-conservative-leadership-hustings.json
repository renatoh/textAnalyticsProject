The island\u2019s Conservative MP, Bob Seely, wants the contenders to clarify how they would deal with the telecoms firm, after he obtained a leaked copy of a legal memo that he argued undermined its claim it was independent of the Chinese state. \u201cWe need clear political leadership,\u201d Seely said ahead of the meeting on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI want the candidates to assert the importance of our own western values, the importance of open and free societies and to exclude Huawei.\u201d The MP has been campaigning for a total ban on Huawei for several weeks, after it emerged that Theresa May was minded to allow the company to supply 5G kit to \u201cnon core\u201d parts of the network following a leak from a fraught national security council meeting. The leak of that decision in principle prompted several Tories to protest, arguing that a Chinese company should not be allowed to supply critical technology because it could be subverted and used for surveillance. Gavin Williamson was fired as defence secretary after May concluded he was responsible for the leak. A final decision on Huawei is due to be made under the new prime minister, after the Trump administration lobbied intensively for it to be reversed in the run-up to the US president\u2019s visit to the UK last month. Johnson has said little about Huawei, although advisers had indicated he was likely to reverse the decision, while Hunt has previously said the UK should exercise \u201ca degree of caution\u201d about large Chinese companies. The legal memo sent to Seely was produced by international law firm Clifford Chance, and is a review of \u201cwhether Chinese laws authorise the Chinese government to order manufacturers to hack into products they make to spy on disable communications\u201d. The law firm was cited by John Suffolk, Huawei\u2019s global cybersecurity and privacy officer, in testimony to parliament earlier this month in support of the company\u2019s opinion that Chinese law \u201cdoesn\u2019t require Huawei to undertake anything that weakens Huawei\u2019s position in terms of security\u201d. The leaked legal memo, dated November 2018, concludes that China\u2019s five intelligence, state security and counter terror laws \u201cdo not appear to have extraterritorial effect\u201d outside the Asian country. But Seely said that the memo\u2019s value was undermined by the disclaimer at the end of the document, which concluded that it \u201cshould not be construed as constituting a legal opinion on the application of PRC [Chinese] law\u201d. The document itself makes clear that Clifford Chance is reviewing another legal analysis prepared by Zhong Lun, a Chinese law firm. It says that it \u201cindependently assessed the analysis and supporting materials\u201d Zhong Lun provided. \u201cMy view is that this is not the first time that promises involving Huawei have turned out not be what they first appeared. It says it is a private company, but is dependent Chinese law; it promises not to spy but it is not clear this is worth the paper it is written on,\u201d Seely said. Huawei is 99% owned by a trade union council representing its Chinese employees. The company also told MPs on a parliamentary committee that had gone through \u201ca period of clarification\u201d with the Chinese government over the meaning and application of the country\u2019s intelligence and security laws. Referring to the legal memo, Suffolk said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had that validated via our lawyers and revalidated by Clifford Chance ... according to our legal advice, that does not require Huawei to undertake anything that weakens Huawei\u2019s position in terms of security.\u201d Huawei effectively responded by releasing a white paper on innovation and intellectual property with a warning from its chief legal officer Song Liuping that \u201cif politicians use intellectual property as a political tool\u201d then \u201cthey will destroy confidence in the patent protection system\u201d. The document released by Song said the company respected trade secrets and intellectual property, saying that all employees had to sign a agreement to respect \u201cthe confidential information of other companies and individuals\u201d. It was \u201cwilling to share our technology with the world,\u201d Song added, and \u201cthat includes 5G\u201d as long as other countries were willing to play by the rules. Separately, Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee wrote to both candidates asking them to clarify their positions on future spending for the armed forces. Hunt has previously promised to raise the level of spending from the current 2% to 2.5% of GDP, an increase of around \u00a315bn in cash terms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
