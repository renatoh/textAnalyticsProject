But little here suggested Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side will clamber off the bottom of their Nations League group by beating Wales at this venue on Tuesday, nor that a glorious future awaits just beyond that. Still, small steps and all that, and this one was in the right direction for Ireland. Or wasn\u2019t backwards, at least. O\u2019Neill tried things, the Irish fought hard, Cyrus Christie surprised in a central midfield role and the Preston North End forward Callum Robinson looked perky after being sprung from the bench late on. Those were the main positives. On the downside, Ireland\u2019s execution of even basic ploys was mostly dreadful and the squad is grievously short of creativity. The sad thing as far as the spectacle was concerned was that Denmark were not much better. Christian Eriksen was the game\u2019s most influential player by not being here. The absence through injury of the Tottenham schemer, who struck a brilliant hat-trick when the Danes shattered Ireland\u2019s World Cup qualifying ambitions here in November, was merciful on Ireland. Denmark\u2019s manager, \u00c5ge Hareide, said it also tested his players. \u201cThis team needs to play matches without Eriksen, we can\u2019t rely on him all the time,\u201d he said. On this evidence they need a lot more practice. Hareide was pleased with the draw, which allows him to watch Tuesday\u2019s match from the top of the group. \u201cWhen you get three teams in a group, you have to play tactically. One way was not to lose to Ireland and to leave it to Wales and Ireland to battle it out for three points. It will be a tight game and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they drew.\u201d O\u2019Neill said his men will go into that game in a better frame of mind thanks to the solidity they showed here, which contrasted markedly with their fragility during September\u2019s 4-1 defeat in Cardiff. \u201cWe have kept a clean sheet, which is very, very important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rebuilding process. One stage at a time.\u201d That process involved deploying his team with three central defenders, a system he trialled in last month\u2019s friendly draw in Poland. O\u2019Neill has never been one to bow to popular demand but he finally gave a first start to Matt Doherty, the Wolves defender who began here at right wing-back in the absence of S\u00e9amus Coleman. Christie was assigned an unfamiliar role in central midfield and did well, showing impressive tenacity and dynamism. \u201cI think he was terrific,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. The Fulham man even had Ireland\u2019s only shot on target, forcing a good save from Kasper Schmeichel with a rasping drive from 20 yards in the second half. Such was the lack of ingenuity in the Irish side that their best other chance came in the first period after Denmark stopped playing because Harry Arter had gone down injured. The referee did not whistle so Jeff Hendrick played on, striding through on goal only to fire wide. He was immediately surrounded by Danes berating him for a lack of sportsmanship. \u201cHe was totally unaware [that Arter had gone down] and thought they had just made a sloppy pass,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt would have been interesting if he had scored. It might have been one of those situations where we would have had to let them score at the other end.\u201d There seemed barely any other hope of a breakthrough. Denmark were technically better than the hosts but also had no imagination. The closest they came to a goal was when Simon Kjaer met a corner with a firm header. Arter booted it off the line. From open play Pione Sisto threatened in the first half with a fine curling shot from 20 yards that skimmed the outside of the post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
