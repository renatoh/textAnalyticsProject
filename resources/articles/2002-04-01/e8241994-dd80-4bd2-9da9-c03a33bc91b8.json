With four games to go, three of them at home, his Birmingham team are well placed to make the play-offs for the fourth successive season and, after only two defeats in 11 games, pick up that coveted Premiership place. But they did not play well in this muck-and-nettles affair that featured Trevor Francis, the man Birmingham fired to make way for Bruce, in the Palace dugout. They left, though, with a point that was a great comfort to Bruce after the team bus got through the blockade of 300 or so irate home fans who detained them in the car park half an hour after the whistle. As he was boarding the bus a glass bottle thrown at him shattered near his feet. Bruce kept his own counsel after the game, presumably for fear of overstepping the gagging order that was part of the \u00a3300,000 settlement Birmingham paid to hire him from Palace in December. He began with a team that had no survivors from the one that beat Palace 1-0 the day before he was hired and only four of yesterday's starters were Francis signings. But one of them, the goalkeeper Nico Vaesen, ensured that Birmingham left with their point. Once in the first half and three times in the second Vaesen produced magnificent saves from Danny Granville free-kicks, and for the last one he also beat away Dougie Freedman's volley from the rebound. \"There was one team trying to win that game and the other one was trying not to get beat,\" said Francis, who claimed not to have heard any of the abuse hurled at Bruce from the vast majority of the crowd throughout. \"It's a good point for them. I think they will go into the play-offs but I thought that when I was at the club.\" Birmingham created the best first-half chance, Geoff Horsfield finding Stern John in the clear on 32 minutes. But the Trinidad striker's low shot from 10 yards was blocked by Matt Clarke. Ade Akinbiyi, who had a second-half header cleared off the line, might have done better soon after when free in the box but Michael Johnson arrived with the covering tackle. So preoccupied were the crowd with Bruce that they even forgot to boo the \u00a32.2m striker. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
