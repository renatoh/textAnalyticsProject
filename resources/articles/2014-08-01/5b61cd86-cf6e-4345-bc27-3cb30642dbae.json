Downing Street sources say Crosby has made clear in private talks with aides that he cannot see any advantage in Cameron taking part in the debates. It is understood Crosby hopes that by complicating negotiations between the parties and the broadcasters over the number, style and timings of the debates, the debates can ultimately be avoided. A source said: \"The public think Ed Miliband is weird so why give him a chance to dissuade them of that opinion through the debates. Miliband might even be quite good at them \u2013 surely much better to have weeks of pictures of Cameron on industrial sites and factories talking about economic growth. There may be a few blokes dressed in chickens chasing him around but no one votes on whether a TV debate has been staged or not. That's Crosby's position.\" A Downing Street spokesman said he \"had not heard him [Crosby] say that\", adding: \"The TV debates will happen. Negotiations start in the autumn.\" Unlike Labour and the Liberal Democrats, however, the Conservatives have yet to announce the identity of the senior party officials who will negotiate over the terms of any debates. Neither have they taken part in talks with the broadcasters, unlike Labour and the Lib Dems. The only suggestions from Downing Street are that Cameron wants a different set-up to the debates to 2010 and that he believes they should not be allowed to dominate the 2015 campaign. He is said to support the \"2-3-5\" proposal in which Cameron would hold one debate with Miliband before a debate with both Miliband and Nick Clegg. A third debate would include Ukip's Nigel Farage and the Green party leader, Natalie Bennett. Another potentially complicating factor is a proposal by YouTube, which is owned by Google, and the Guardian and the Telegraph for one of the party leaders' debates to be staged on the internet. It is understood that Labour and the Lib Dems are planning to go ahead with negotiations without the Tories if they do not present a negotiating team by the end of the party conferences. In May a cross-party Lords committee said that televised debates between the party leaders must go ahead because they engage young voters in politics. In a report, the Lords communications committee said the contests would tackle apathy among young people, citing polls showing 87% of 18- to 24-year-olds said the debates led to them discussing the election with friends. Michael Dugher, the Labour MP who will lead pre-debate negotiations on behalf of Miliband, said his party would be happy to sit down before the party conferences to discuss a way forward on the issue. A source close to the prime minister said that the opposition was keen to start negotiations because \"they didn't have much else to do\".
