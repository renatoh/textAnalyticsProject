'The time has arrived to put my family and my wife before the England team,' he said. 'My children want their daddy, not some so-called superstar. Physically, I know I still have a lot to offer England, so this was a hard decision for me to make. I didn't want to let Andy or any of the England guys down, but the pull of my family proved greater. I've got five children and a beautiful wife, and it's time for them to be placed first.' Robinson has been the most successful convert from rugby league and scored England's only try in their World Cup final triumph over Australia in 2003. He will continue to play for Sale, his club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
