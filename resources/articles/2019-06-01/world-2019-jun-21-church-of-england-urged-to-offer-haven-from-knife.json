Rosemarie Mallett, a vicar in Angell Town, Brixton, south London, will urge churches to offer themselves as sanctuaries, both for young people in need of a quiet, safe place and those urgently fleeing violent attacks. \u201cIn every place where there is a problem of serious youth violence, there is a church. Too often the doors are shut,\u201d said Mallett, setting out her proposals before next month\u2019s General Synod in York. \u201cIs there a way that churches can be open, particularly between the hours of 3pm and 6pm, to be places of safety, of welcome, where young people can go?\u201d She said Angell Town, where she has been vicar for 12 years, was \u201can area blighted by serious youth violence. Certainly my time there has been punctuated by too many deaths, too many young people. I\u2019ve been involved in too many funerals.\u201d But knife crime was not just a problem for inner cities, she added. Gang-related \u201ccounty line\u201d activity meant serious youth violence had spread. \u201cIt\u2019s become a national problem.\u201d In 2018 there were 40,000 knife crime offences in the UK, \u201cthe highest number since any kind of data was collected,\u201d said Mallett. Churches should become part of a nexus of support along with other community groups and agencies, she said. Knife amnesty bins could be situated in churches, where young people might feel more inclined to take weapons than police stations. The C of E, which is the second largest provider of state education in the country, should monitor exclusions and develop strategies to minimise their number, Mallett said. There was a proven link between school exclusions, young people being sent to pupil referral units, and becoming involved in serious violence, she said. Training and resources should be provided to clergy and church leaders to increase awareness of the signs of vulnerability to gang exploitation. Mallett said youth provision in her area had been hit by government funding cuts, but she stressed that the church did not play the same role as the state. Young people came to her church \u201cto use the space to have quiet time, to think about the situation they find themselves in.\u201d At next month\u2019s five-day synod session, members will also hear C of E plans to invest up to \u00a363m to train the increasing number of people applying to become priests. In the past two years there has been a 23% increase in people training for ordination. David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said in his diocese there had been particular growth in female and minority ethnic candidates for the priesthood. \u201cThe growth will help us deal with the demographic challenge of many existing clergy coming to retirement. It won\u2019t necessarily mean a net increase in the number of stipendiary clergy, but it will stem the decline,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
