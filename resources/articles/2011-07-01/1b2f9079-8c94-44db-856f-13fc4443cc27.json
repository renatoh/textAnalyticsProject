To clarify: Brooks once worked with the owner of the centre when it was based in London and he also helped bring it to Champneys two years ago, but since then he has had no connection with it (The spa for stars that helped secure Stephenson's fate, 18 July, page 4) \u2022 An article on the closure of the Interstate 405 in Los Angeles said that Real Madrid were playing against \"David Beckham's old team, the LA Galaxy\". It should have said Real Madrid, Beckham's old team, were playing against the LA Galaxy, his current one (Fresh air, quiet streets: LA avoids its Carmageddon, 18 July, page 18). \u2022 A diary item beginning \"Salad days for Ed Miliband, meanwhile, with triumph after triumph over Murdoch-gate\" misinterpreted the line from Shakespeare.

(Diary, 21 July, page 33). \u2022 A report of the Queen stage of the Tour de France, (Schleck dares and wins with towering performance, 22 July, page 6, Sport), said that only 78 riders finished within the stipulated 120% of the winner's time: that should have been 109%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
