The spectre of the country\u2019s economic crisis flaring up again deepened as the extent of the differences between creditors was laid bare. Caught in the middle, Athens also ratcheted up the rhetoric, as its finance minister told the Guardian that the IMF was \u201ceconomising with the truth\u201d. \u201cGreece is being boxed into a corner,\u201d said Euclid Tsakalotos, claiming that the country was under intense pressure to specify new austerity measures that made \u201cno economic or political sense\u201d. The war of words intensified after the IMF issued a 1,300-word statement distancing itself from the economic policies underpinning the nation\u2019s latest bailout. The adjustment programme agreed last summer in exchange for \u20ac86bn (\u00a372bn) worth of rescue loans \u2013 a plan the IMF has so far refused to support \u2013 was based on measures that were \u201cunfriendly to growth\u201d, wrote Poul Thomsen, who directs the IMF\u2019s European department, and Maurice Obstfeld, its chief economist. \u201cIt is not the IMF that is demanding more austerity,\u201d the officials argued in a blog published late on Monday. \u201cIf Greece agrees with its European partners on ambitious fiscal targets, don\u2019t criticise the IMF \u2026 when we ask to see the measures required to make such targets credible.\u201d Athens, they said, had agreed to achieve a budget surplus \u2013 where state tax income exceeds expenditure \u2013 of 3.5% of GDP once the bailout expired in 2018, a feat that was not feasible without further cuts, said the IMF. On Tuesday, the European commission hit back, insisting that the economic fundamentals were not only sound, but working. \u201cThe European institutions consider that the policies of the ESM program are sound and if fully implemented can return Greece to sustainable growth and can allow Greece to regain market access,\u201d said commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt. The plan, she added, had undergone \u201cseveral parts of scrutiny\u201d, and even the European court of auditors had provided feedback, which had been taken into account. The spat erupted as creditor mission chiefs arrived in Athens to continue what has become an increasingly vexed review of the programme. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration had hoped to wrap up the review by the end of this month, paving the way for Greece to enter the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme early next year, which would allow the ECB to buy Greek sovereign debt. That, officials claim, would allow further discussions on debt relief seen as crucial if the recession-ravaged Greek economy is ever to recover. Hopes of a political breakthrough are now resting on meetings Tsipras will have later this week with German and French leaders. But on past form, lenders are unlikely to yield, and Greek officials are now worrying that the row could be the precursor of the IMF pulling out of the programme altogether. Berlin, the biggest provider of the rescue monies poured into the three bailouts Athens has received since 2010, says IMF participation is a condition of further disbursement of funds. But it disagrees vehemently over the need to restructure the country\u2019s \u20ac330bn debt pile. If there is no resolution, the risk of Grexit \u2013 forced ejection from the euro \u2013 will also grow. \u201cThe IMF is economising with the truth when it says it is not asking for more austerity but rather is the victim of Greece\u2019s bizarre predilection to \u2018agree\u2019 to higher primary fiscal targets of 3.5% of GDP,\u201d said Tsakalotos. \u201cGreece has not \u2018agreed\u2019 to anything yet.\u201d Tsakalotos charged that the IMF was advocating policies that were bound to increase inequality and social exclusion \u2013 contradicting its own self-avowed goal of inclusive growth. \u201cIn effect it is arguing for Greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies,\u201d he continued, conceding that Athens had proposed a primary surplus target of 2.5% which neither the EU nor IMF had deigned to consider. \u201cGreek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70% of the EU average and 52% of that of Germany.\u201d Last week, Tsipras announced a one-off special Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u20ac800 or less a month \u2013 a move that provoked further ire in Brussels. On Tuesday he went a step further, describing IMF staff as \u201cirrational technocrats\u201d and saying that far-flung isles close to Turkey that had borne the brunt of the refugee crisis would henceforth be exempt from a special VAT tax also demanded by creditors. \u201cCitizens on these islands must feel sure that the state is looking after them,\u201d he announced during a flying visit to the tiny isle of Nisyros. \u201cThey are shouldering the burden of reception and hospitality and, ultimately, the entire burden of Europe \u2026 We will keep to the programme, but we are not going to ask anyone about giving surplus money to those most in need.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
