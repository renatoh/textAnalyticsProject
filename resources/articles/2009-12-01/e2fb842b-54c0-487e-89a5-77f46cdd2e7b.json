A few months ago the amiable American broke hearts by edging out Tom Watson to win the Open Championship and today he was at it again, taking the place of Tiger Woods, who was elsewhere when the time came to take the stage for his scheduled pre-tournament press conference at the Chevron World Challenge. Talk about an anticlimax. It was like turning up to a Beatles gig to find they had been replaced by Gerry and thePacemakers. It was buying a ticket to see The Godfather: Part II only to walk intothe cinema and find it was showing Love Actually. It was like expecting the world's most famous sportsman to describe in detail a minor car crash that has somehow snowballed into a international accident only to find the world's blandest golfer describe how he likes to tinker with his swing. The satellite trucks that had been parked outside Sherwood Country Club early in the morning were long gone by the time Cink took the microphone. The hundreds of reporters who had been expected to fill the temporary media room never materialised, leaving the PGA Tour regulars and the event organisers to tip-toe through the metaphorical wreckage of the past few days. \"We are totally supportive of Tiger's decision to stay at home with his family,\" said Greg McLaughlin, tournament director of the Chevron World Challenge. \"He didn't play in the event last year because of his knee injury and we had a very successful tournament. I'm sure that will be the case this year.\" Annually this event raises an estimated \u00a32m for charity, the Tiger Woods Foundation, and there is no reason to believe it will fall short of McLaughlin's expectations this time. Certainly today's pro-am, for which participants paid a minimum entry fee of $10,000 (\u00a36,000), was sold out and as of last night Woods's withdrawal had not prompted a flood of requests for refunds. But, if the tournament's success is guaranteed \u2013 at least on its own terms \u2013 there is still plenty of rough to negotiate before the winner's cheque is handed over on Sunday afternoon. Indeed the words were barely out of McLaughlin's mouth when the story that never ends kept on never ending, with Woods being charged by the Florida Highway Patrol for careless driving and the American gossip magazine US Weekly reporting that a cocktail waitress from Los Angeles had an alleged affair with the golfer and has the phone messages to prove it. Over on the driving range at Sherwood, where Woods' peers were getting ready for Thursday's opening round, these latest developments were greeted by the sound of jaws dropping and mouths clamping shut. \"I'm not going there,\" said one of the world's leading players who, like most people, could not resist the temptation to go there, albeit on condition of anonymity. \"It is amazing to me that on a day that Barack Obama sends 34,000 extra troops to Afghanistan the world is obsessed with this minor car crash.\" Professional players are often maligned for their supposed detachment from events in the real world, so perhaps some credit is due in this instance. Less impressive, or at least more puzzling, was the timidity with which those around Sherwood tackled the subject of Woods and his problems. The explanation for this, in part at least, lies in the fact that, like mafia dons, leading players have an Omert\u00e0 covering virtually every aspect of their lives. What happens on the course stays on the course \u2013 at least the controversial bits do \u2013 and the same rule applies away from the links, only doubly so. It is also the case that Woods is genuinely popular with his colleagues. He is , it is worth noting, in a position to hand out the occasional favour to his friends. Entry to this week's tournament is based on world ranking position but the host is also able to hand out a couple of invitations \u2013 a not insubstantial favour given that the prize fund to be shared among 18 players is $5.75m (\u00a33.5m); $1.35m (\u00a3800,000) to the winner and $150,000 (\u00a390,000) to the man who finishes last. Certainly Ian Poulter could not have sounded more enthusiastic about being invited into Tiger's exclusive club. \"I'm buzzing to be here this week. I've never played in the tournament and there are world ranking points at stake,\" the Englishman said. As for the great man's non-appearance? \"It's disappointing for everyone but I bet no one is more disappointed than Tiger himself.\" One suspects that might rank as the understatement of this or any other golfing year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
