Her second album, however, tries to tone down her childlike cartoonishness, as you can tell from Sorry I'm Late's artwork, which features the singer smoking sultrily in a bubble bath. It's still fun though; roping in Beth Ditto and Scandipop newcomer Tove Lo for co-writing credits was a wise choice, and the elasticated bounce of Just Be Mine and the speed garage K-Pop of Dirty Love overload the senses brilliantly. But Lloyd has perhaps spent too much time ingratiating herself with the US, and as a result her sound is sometimes hollow \u2013 the epic could-be-country anthem Human, and the saccharine Disney princess acoustic ballad Goodnight, for example."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
