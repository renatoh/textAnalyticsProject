The study found that 95% of those questioned think people should speak English and 77% said people must have lived in Britain for most of their lives to be \"truly British\". Just under three-quarters [74%] said it is important to have been born in the UK to be considered British. NatCen, which carries out the annual survey, asked the same questions about Britishness in 1995, 2003 and 2013. It said that while attitudes changed little between 1995 and 2003 the threshold for being British had risen in the last 10 years \u2013 with the exception of the proportion who said people had to be Christian to be British, which fell from 31% in 2003 to 24% in 2013. Penny Young, chief executive, NatCen Social Research, said: \"In an increasingly diverse, multicultural country, we might expect people to be more relaxed about what it means to be British, yet the trend is going in the opposite direction.\" There has also been an increasingly toxic debate around immigration in the UK and Tuesday's survey found that overall people remain anxious about it \u2013 although there are large regional variations. More than three-quarters (77%) of people said they wanted immigration reduced \"a little\" or \"a lot\" \u2013 a proportion largely unchanged since the last time the question was asked in 2008. Nearly two-thirds said EU migrants should have to wait three years or more before they are allowed to claim social security benefits. But there was considerable diversity of opinion about the impact immigration has had on the UK's economy and culture. Londoners and graduates are the most likely to think immigration has had a positive economic impact \u2013 54% of Londoners compared with 28% of people elsewhere in the UK, and 60% of graduates compared with 17% of people with no qualifications said immigration has had a positive impact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
