Steffen Iversen's successful penalty kick was the more painful element of a double set-back that began with James McFadden conceding the award by handling a net-bound header on his own goal line after 55 minutes. Now McFadden, as a result of his ordering off, will miss the match against Moldova. The inevitable removal of McFadden so early in the second half - immediately followed by Iversen's goal - amounted to confirmation of the suspicion that, for the home support, this would be something of an ordeal. Berti Vogts's expulsion to the stand by the Belgian referee, Paul Allaerts - the Scotland manager seemed to be (unjustifiably) animated over an earlier incident in which Iversen stopped a shot from Richard Hughes on the line - could not be said to have been anything like as detrimental to the Scots' chances, but it did rather complete the picture of an all-round miserable day. Inevitably, the result will raise fresh questions about Vogts's future, but he remained adamant after the match that his job was secure because he retained the support of the Scottish Football Association. When asked in English whether he expected to be fired he replied, 'Ask the question to my president [John McBeth] not me.' But when quizzed on the same subject in his native German he added: 'I have the joy back which I had lost in Germany. My only target is the 2006 finals and I do not expect to be sacked.' He was bullish enough, too, to predict a Scotland victory in Moldova on Wednesday. At Hampden Park, however, the singular difficulty presented by the onus of winning at home is one that the Scots are not especially well equipped to overcome. The need for imagination, verve, fluent execution of passing and movement - all carried out at a high tempo - are qualities for which Vogts's side are not exactly renowned. Indeed, the business of prising open a compact, disciplined defence, of the type practised by Norway, has often seemed a mystery to Scotland during the German's time as manager. A further complication in this latest outing was the lack of match fitness of Darren Fletcher and McFadden (before his dismissal), the pair having been only occasional picks for Manchester United and Everton respectively. The rust often showed in Fletcher, especially during a first half in which he had numerous opportunities to exploit space on the right of midfield, but lacked the sharpness to trouble a well-disciplined back four that had Andre Bergdolmo, Erik Hagen, Claus Lundekvam and John Arne Riise working as a well co-ordinated unit. Indeed, it was the Norwegians during the first half who appeared much the more dangerous, a common enough phenomenon in matches where the visitors are not burdened by the expectations of a capacity crowd. Even so, the number of occasions on which Age Hareide's side appeared likely to score seemed excessive. It took the Scots 30 minutes to win their first corner, by which time the Norwegians had taken six. From one of these, from Riise on the right, the monumental John Carew glanced a header marginally high and noticeably reproached himself for squandering what he obviously considered a golden opportunity. Carew had shown his menace much earlier, in fact, when he carried the ball easily past Gary Holt on the left, before nutmegging Gary Caldwell almost on the dead-ball line. The low cut-back was only just touched out by the diving and stretching Craig Gordon before being cleared by Andy Webster. Almost predictably, that first corner kick by Scotland brought the scramble in the goalmouth that took them as close as it is possible to get to scoring without actually troubling the referee. McFadden's delivery from the right landed at the feet of Paul Dickov, whose shot was blocked on the line by Iversen. The midfielder then repeated the feat from the follow-up shot from Hughes. Why Vogts should have been so upset by the incident is mystifying, since the ball had clearly not crossed the line. Yet he was in no mood to change his mind afterwards. 'We scored a goal in the first half,' Vogts said. 'I saw it on TV but it was a decision from the referee. I only told the linesman \"please, watch TV,\" that was all.' Vogts was given a much more legitimate reason for disgust soon after the break, however, when Norway took the lead and McFadden took his leave. It was from Magne Hoset's corner on the right that visiting captain Claus Lundekvam looped a header past Gordon from six yards. McFadden, on the line, clearly forgot himself, clawing the ball out with his left hand. His slow walk to the dressing room was immediately followed by Iversen drilling the conversion low to Gordon's right. Had substitute Morten Pedersen demonstrated similar composure, he would have doubled the advantage later, when he turned past two defenders and, with only Gordon to beat, chipped the ball several feet too high. In desperation, Vogts filled his team with forwards, sending on Steven Thompson and Kenny Miller. But the damage was, predictably, irreparable.
