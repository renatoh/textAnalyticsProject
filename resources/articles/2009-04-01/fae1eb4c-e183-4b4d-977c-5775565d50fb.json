He also pledged increased efforts to crack down on the trafficking of guns from the US to Mexico where, he said, \"they are fuelling extraordinary violence\". With the drug wars killing 6,300 people in Mexico last year and beginning to spill over the border in to the US, security was at the centre of yesterday's stop over en route to the Americas Summit in Trinidad and Tobago which opens today. The violence is rooted in the brutal efforts of the different Mexican trafficking groups to dominate smuggling routes for South American cocaine heading to the US, as well as local production of marijuana, heroine and synthetic drugs and control of the domestic user markets. The ferocity of these turf wars has spiralled since Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Mexico's president, launched a military-led offensive against the cartels two years ago. While the government claims this reflects the desperation of the traffickers, critics say the strategy is ill thought out and counterproductive. No such thoughts were evident in Obama's responses at the press conference held after his meeting with Calder\u00f3n in which he repeatedly stressed the need for the US and Mexico to work together. \"We are absolutely committed to working in partnership with Mexico to make sure that we are dealing with this scourge on both sides of the border,\" Obama said. \"You can't fight this war with just one hand. You can't have Mexico making an effort and the United States not making an effort.\" Obama's rhetorical endorsement of Mexican policy is the culmination of a series of similarly supportive visits from high-level members of his administration, beginning with secretary of state Hillary Clinton last month. The trips were hastily organised after Calder\u00f3n began to react angrily in public at the growing number of voices in Washington that had started comparing the situation in Mexico to instability in Pakistan. After Forbes Magazine included Mexican trafficker Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in its rich list, Calder\u00f3n complained of a US media campaign against Mexico. But if Calder\u00f3n could bask in Obama's visit on Thursday, the messages emanating from the US government are still not entirely consistent. Many expect Carlos Pascual, a diplomat who made his name as an expert in failed states, to be named as the new ambassador to Mexico. There is also considerable scepticism in Mexico about the promises to do more to stop firearms finding their way into the hands of the cartels, given the strength of the pro-gun lobby in the US. At yesterday's press conference Obama said he had not reneged on the support he expressed during the election campaign for reinstating an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 but added, \"none of us has any illusion that this would be easy\". In the meantime, he added, \"we want to act with urgency, promptly, now,\" which, he said, meant focusing on enforcing existing laws. \"I think a lot can be done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
