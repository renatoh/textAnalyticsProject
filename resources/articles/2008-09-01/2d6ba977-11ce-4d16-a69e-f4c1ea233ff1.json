As long as you use a good quality chocolate there's a wonderful meeting of earthy richnesses that can only be described as stunning\u2026on more than one level! For 10 250g 70% chocolate, organic &amp; fairtrade 250g butter, salted 320g soft brown sugar 4 eggs 450g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder pinch salt 1 medium sized beetroot, peeled and grated 400g mascarpone 100g cr\u00e8me fraiche juice of half a lemon 2 tbsp caster sugar organic, fairtrade cocoa powder for dusting Pre-heat the oven to 160\u00baC/320\u00baF. Melt the chocolate until completely smooth in a bowl over gently steaming water. Cream the butter and sugar, preferably using a mixer as it's much easier to get it fluffy. Add the eggs in one at a time and keep beating until smooth, then blend in the melted chocolate. Sift the flour with the baking powder, and fold it into the mix along with the grated beetroot and half the mascarpone. Tip into a buttered, floured 30cm springform tin and bake in the centre of the oven for about 1 hour, or until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool completely, then slice in half. Beat the mascarpone with the cr\u00e8me fraiche, lemon juice and caster sugar. Slather it in the middle then reconstruct your cake and cover generously with cocoa sifted through a sieve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
