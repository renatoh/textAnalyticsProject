Just as 0-3 against Grimsby does not make a monkey of George Burley, beating Wednesday at home is no mark of a messiah. Yet Ipswich should perhaps bend an ear to the claims of their caretaker. \"If you were on a rocket ship going to the moon, the man you would want sitting next to you would be Tony Mowbray,\" said Bruce Rioch of his captain long ago at Middlesbrough. Ipswich's descent from heavenly orbit has been a rough one; they had assumed their ticket to the First Division was a return, but the tractor is in dire need of jet propulsion. Mowbray is the incumbent after Burley's fall on Friday but few expect it to stay that way, and certainly not the covetous Ronnie Moore of Rotherham, who all but went on his knees after his side's draw with Gillingham. Mowbray's supplication was more prosaic. \"I've been here seven years now, four as a player. I'd like to think I'm a man of integrity who works hard and does his best. I've got a good football knowledge. My ambition is to be a manager and if that isn't here I'll be putting my hat in the ring at other clubs,\" he said. If graft and grit are what is required, Ipswich already have their man. Mowbray's 20-year playing career was always more Ron than Rio: revered on Teesside for captaining Boro from liquidation in 1986 to double promotion, respected in Glasgow as the centre-half who stood firm when much around him crumbled during Celtic's dark hours in the mid-1990s. Ipswich took their cue on Saturday. Steady and controlled for all but the dying moments, they were seen home before half-time by Pablo Counago's wit and opportunism allied to Matt Holland's most convincing display of late, all snap and crackle. Wednesday beavered away, particularly after Lloyd Owusu's appearance at half-time gave much-needed bustle up front. His fine cross set up Simon Donnelly and a nervy climax, but the gods were against them. \"The chairman was in the papers this week saying results had to improve,\" said Terry Yorath, gazing nervously in his wing mirrors after no wins in eight, \"but that performance is one I can go home and take some satisfaction out of.\" Man of the match : Matt Holland (Ipswich)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
