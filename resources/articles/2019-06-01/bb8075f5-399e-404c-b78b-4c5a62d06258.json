That\u2019s science, right there! \u201cI\u2019m motivated by people who like me, who are fighting for the same things. I take more energy from that than from trying to prove anyone wrong. That\u2019s draining on yourself. But for me, to be gay and fabulous, during Pride month at the World Cup, is nice.\u201d Her latest comments follow the 33-year-old\u2019s row with Donald Trump, after footage shot earlier this year emerged showing her saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d when she was asked whether she would visit if her team won the World Cup. She urged her USA teammates to \u201cthink hard\u201d about associating themselves with Trump before the win over France, whilst apologising for using an obscenity, but repeating she would not visit the White House if the team won. Her White House comments thrust her into the president\u2019s spotlight. This week he accused her on Twitter of disrespect and said she should \u201cwin first before she talks\u201d. When the USA manager, Jill Ellis, was asked about whether she was worried her star forward\u2019s comments would detract from her performance pre-match, she was emphatic: \u201cNo and, to be frank, I wasn\u2019t aware until the press officer told me. That\u2019s the head down approach I have. \u201cI have not worried at all, she handled herself incredibly well at the presser the other day and you can hear her comments and expressed herself she is experienced and eloquent I would point to the performance today and say this stuff bounces off her and pushes her forward.\u201d On the evening itself Rapinoe was thoughtful about the performance of the USA, who now face England in Tuesday\u2019s semi-final. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the best night on the ball but defensively, the willingness and the discipline to do what we did was impressive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were ruthless in our chances. Moving on to the next round, that\u2019s really all that matters.\u201d For France another quarter-final defeat hurts. Their manager, Corrine Diacre, had said pre-match that: \u201cWe have had quarter final defeats haunting us for a while.\u201d But, when asked whether this defeat was a failure for French football and whether she should depart, Diacre was clear. \u201cI am not a person to give up,\u201d she said. \u201c[I have] no regret, the president of the French FA has shown his confidence with a long-term contract but he will make this decision on a personal level. We still have work to do a number of things, to work on together, I hope. \u201cBut yes, it is a failure on the footballing level. I don\u2019t think we should shy away from that. We are a long way from our target. I hope we have won over the hearts and minds of the public and it will help the women\u2019s game to go further and move into the next level. \u201cWe showed despite everything we weren\u2019t too far off US I have never seen US switch to a five-man back line that early. It\u2019s a sign.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
