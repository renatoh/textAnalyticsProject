His flair in conjuring up a diversionary manoeuvre is unsurpassed. Only Sir Alex Ferguson could have devised a new way of deploring the referee. Alan Wiley, who had conducted himself fairly well in the 2-2 draw with Sunderland, was angered and amazed to hear his stamina derided. This, of course, was artfully displaced rage and Ferguson's true anger would have been trained on the players in the privacy of the dressing room. Few would have quibbled if the visitors had won instead of thwarting themselves with Anton Ferdinand's own goal in stoppage time. Leading managers such as Ferguson are on edge this season. There are doubts about all four of the Champions League representatives, even if Arsenal's case is different from the others. In some ways, the evidence conceals decline rather than exposing it. United, with 19 points from eight Premier League matches, have not had a stronger opening to a campaign since the autumn of 1999. Statistics, all the same, lack the sturdiness to keep foreboding at bay. Chelsea head the table and have won all their matches with the exception of the collapse at Wigan, yet nobody heralds the advent of a rampant team. There is stagnation in the upper reaches of the table, with Manchester City alone having acted as if they had a programme of quantitative easing to save the transfer market. Signings, or the lack of them, are the issue for a league that has long depended on the accompanying razzmatazz. The starting line-ups for Chelsea, United, Arsenal and Liverpool at the weekend contained just two men who are in their debut seasons for those clubs: Glen Johnson and Thomas Vermaelen. In the normal course of events, there would have been a flood of recruits. With Rio Ferdinand's fitness in question, the single reliable defender at Old Trafford is Patrice Evra. In addition, Ferguson often resorts to fielding Paul Scholes in deep midfield, where his coarse tackling may be a problem, because the veteran, who turns 35 next month, is no longer able to make so many attacking runs. Carlo Ancelotti will not be smug. Didier Drogba is uncontainable for the time being and although Chelsea have coped so far with his three-match suspension in the Champions League, they will also lose him to the African Cup of Nations in the New Year. That, in itself, is a hindrance for the club, but finding the eventual successor to an attacker who will be 32 in March must be a truly daunting challenge. The Premier League has depended until now on the notion that the means for convincing regeneration will always be at hand. That is not the case any more and, for instance, every department of a faltering Liverpool side feels the effect of the sale of that arch-organiser Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid. It is going to be hard for Alberto Aquilani, when fit, to emulate him. Only Arsenal are at peace, if not merry, as they limit their outlay and make a profit. That, indeed, appears to be Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's preference. The current side, like so many of its predecessors, is a delight with its intelligence, speed, touch and devotion to attack. Yet the indifference towards protecting itself is excessive. United, with a 3-1 win at the Emirates in the Champions League semi-final five months ago, exposed that fault. Vermaelen has been a fine acquisition at centre-back, but the midfield still does not have men who can reduce the threat to the defence as Emmanuel Petit, Patrick Vieira and others once did. While Arsenal wait to see how long Alex Song needs to learn the ropes, the team has been beaten twice in seven league fixtures and conceded 10 goals. Broadly speaking, there is a levelling down among the habitually dominant clubs. There are obvious explanations in the shrinkage of owners' personal fortunes and the drop in the value of the pound. However, there are no indications that the sides are therefore doomed to be also-rans in Europe. Real Madrid, who spent \u00a3226m on Alonso and three other new players, were as fragile as any of them when losing to Sevilla at the weekend. In any case, it is time to relish the pleasures of comparative weakness in this country. There ought to be relief that United, for instance, can fall at Burnley or that Liverpool can be beaten 3-1 at Anfield by Aston Villa. The Premier League has slipped back slightly, but in doing so it may lead to a period in which results can once more take us by surprise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
