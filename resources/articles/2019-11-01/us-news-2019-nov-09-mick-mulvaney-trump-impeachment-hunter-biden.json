Testimony released this week has painted a damning picture of attempts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, potentially in return for an unfreezing of nearly $400m in military aid and a White House meeting with Trump. The 25 July call and concerns over its content became known when an intelligence official filed an anonymous report. Trump and allies such as the Kentucky senator Rand Paul have led Republican pressure for the media to name the whistleblower, contrary to federal law. On Saturday, House Republicans said Hunter Biden and the whistleblower should be called to testify in public hearings set to begin next week. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, reportedly said he was \u201cevaluating\u201d the list but added that the inquiry \u201cwill not serve \u2026 as a vehicle [for] the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the president pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit\u201d. Trump said his new \u201ctranscript\u201d would probably be released on Tuesday. He also characterised the impeachment inquiry as \u201ca lot of witch-hunt\u201d but said Republicans defending him \u201chave never been so united\u201d. On Friday night, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney asked to join a lawsuit that seeks a ruling on whether senior advisers to Trump must testify in the impeachment inquiry. The move came on the same day Mulvaney became the latest senior White House aide not to comply with a subpoena to appear before Democrat-led House committees receiving testimony in private. The suit he wants to join was filed in October by Charles Kupperman, former deputy to former national security adviser John Bolton. House Democrats have not served a subpoena to Bolton, whose lawyer said on Friday he had information about \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d. Bolton has warned he will seek legal recourse if a subpoena is sent. In a game of legal chess, Kupperman\u2019s subpoena has been withdrawn. White House counsel Pat Cipollone has claimed senior aides do not have to comply with impeachment inquiry subpoenas, a claim that is fiercely contested. But career officials from the National Security Council and state department have testified in private. Mulvaney found himself in the crosshairs after admitting last month that aid to Ukraine was held up and telling reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d, an admission he sought to retract. This week, transcripts of testimony by White House aides linked Mulvaney to offers of a Trump meeting for Zelenskiy, if he agreed to investigate the Bidens and a conspiracy theory which says Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 US election. In a filing quoted by the Washington Post, Mulvaney\u2019s lawyers said the issue of whether senior aides should testify \u201cgo[es] to the heart of our representative government and its promise to secure individual liberty by dividing the awesome power of government amongst itself\u201d. \u201cMr Mulvaney, like Mr Kupperman, finds himself caught in that division, trapped between the commands of two of its co-equal branches \u2013 with one of those branches threatening him with contempt. He turns to this court for aid.\u201d When Kupperman\u2019s suit was filed, many observers said it was merely a delaying tactic. Critics of Cipollone\u2019s position say it disregards the oversight role of Congress as set out in the constitution. Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Frank O Bowman III, author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump and a professor at the University of Missouri school of law, said the White House \u201cgag rule\u201d on senior advisers testifying was \u201ccompletely abnormal\u201d. Bowman said: \u201cInasmuch as the no-shows are in response to presidential orders or strong admonitions, they amount to obstruction of the House\u2019s constitutional impeachment function and are therefore a free-standing ground for impeachment.\u201d On Saturday, in a letter to Schiff, ranking Republican intelligence committee member Devin Nunes called for the whistleblower to testify and claimed: \u201cAmericans see through this sham impeachment process.\u201d Other individuals Nunes said should testify included Devon Archer, an associate of Hunter Biden; former Democratic National Committee staffer Alexandra Chalupa; and Nellie Ohr, a \u201cformer contractor for opposition research firm Fusion GPS\u201d, which commissioned the famous Steele dossier on links between Trump and Russia. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that two Ukrainian Americans entangled in the impeachment inquiry pushed previous Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to investigate the Bidens and the conspiracy theory regarding 2016. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman worked with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s personal attorney, on approaches to Ukraine. Parnas and Fruman have been charged with campaign finance offences. Giuliani has defied congressional demands for relevant documentation. According to released testimony, Giuliani\u2019s role in apparent extra-governmental foreign policy caused alarm among national security staffers. Fiona Hill, a British-born Russia expert, told the committees Bolton characterised Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d. According to Hill, Bolton also said he was \u201cnot part of whatever drug deal [EU ambassador Gordon] Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
