The Dane, who was playing in the penultimate group at the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club, was sharing the lead at 14 under par going into the par-five 18th hole, and set up his victory by getting his second shot to within 25 feet. He missed the eagle chance but made birdie from three feet to finish with a 15-under 269 to see off McLardy, who spurned several opportunities to pick up shots over the closing holes. Needing a birdie on the last, McLardy made a mess of his tee shot, pulling it into the trees to blow his chance after he led the tournament overnight with Charl Schwartzel and Scotland's David Drysdale. Drysdale closed with a 69 for a 271 total with Danny Willett , Tyrone van Aswegen and Schwartzel finishing a further shot back. The English pair Richard McEvoy and David Dixon were in a three-way tie one shot further back on 11-under 273. Hansen's closing five-under 66 earned him \u00a3150,480 for his third European Tour title, an unlikely triumph after his opening level-par 71 left him eight shots off the lead. \"It means a lot to win obviously, because that's of course what we're here for,\" Hansen said. \"Especially after the first day when I started double bogey-bogey on the first two holes and I was thinking 'What is this?'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
