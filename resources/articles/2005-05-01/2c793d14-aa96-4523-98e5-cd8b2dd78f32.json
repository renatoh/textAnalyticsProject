I'm the educational leader of the college, the adviser to the board of management and the chief accounting officer, and I can honestly say I enjoy all aspects of the job. We're a medium-sized college with a strong rural focus. We have a main centre and four outreach centres. To go around our centres is a 100-mile round journey - we cover the bit between Dundee and Aberdeen. Because of the travelling distances involved, we really do take the college out into the community to deliver programmes. We cover everything from agriculture to construction, engineering to social sciences to hospitality. We're very proud of the way we encourage people of different ages into the college. We offer children's classes on Saturday mornings: caring for small animals (so they get to bring their pets in), pottery, computer graphic design and father and child cookery classes. A couple of years ago, we had a lifelong learning award, and we decided to give it to a younger student and an older student - the younger student was four and the older student, 91. Part of my job is to represent the sector, to influence politicians, so I play an active part in the Association of Scottish Colleges and I've previously been chair of the Principals' Forum. I've also just finished a secondment to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council to set up a new unit called the further education development directorate. We will set up small teams of people on loan from a college to go and assist another college - a kind of self-help group. The key challenge for Scotland's colleges is the high level of expectation. We've been extremely successful since we left the local authority sector 10 years ago. But there is more demand out there and that, to me, is a real pressure: how we can match what the colleges have the capacity to do with the demand for lifelong learning. I'm sure I'm speaking on behalf of all Scottish principals when I say we get up in the morning and love coming to our jobs. It really is a privilege to be working with the staff and the students that we have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
