Though only 13 minutes long, we heard from the judge, the suspect himself and the victim\u2019s families who offered Roof forgiveness. New details of the shooting emerged on Friday afternoon, as the arrest warrants were released to the public. NAACP national president Cornell William Brooks called the shooting an \u201cact of racial terrorism\u201d in a powerful speech on Friday. He also said that the confederate flag \u201cmust come down\u201d from the South Carolina state capitol. Meanwhile, Rick Perry has called the massacre a \u201cdrug-induced accident\u201d. South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has voiced her support for the death penalty to be used in the case against Roof. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley however has said that he doesn\u2019t personally support the death penalty. A portrait of Dylann Roof as an apparently committed racist has emerged throughout the day That\u2019s it from us today on the live blog, thanks for tuning in. For more on the Charleston shooting, check out all of our stories here. For Twitter updates, follow my colleagues Ed Pilkington (@Edpilkington), Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) and Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland), who are on the ground in Charleston. Amanda Holpuch (@holpuch) is in Columbia. People are filing into the College of Charleston TD Arena for the vigil now, due to start at 6pm. Here\u2019s a copy of the program: The family of Dylann Roof has just issued a public statement, extending their \u201cdeepest sympathies and condolences\u201d to the families of the victims. Words cannot express our shock, grief, and disbelief as to what happened that night. We are devastated and saddened by what occurred. We offer our prayers sympathy for all of those impacted by these events. We have all been touched by the moving words from the victims\u2019 families offering God\u2019s forgiveness and love in the face of such horrible suffering. Our hope and prayer is for peace and healing for the families of the victims, the Charleston community, and those touched by these events throughout the state of South Carolina and our nation. Largely echoing his comments from Thursday on gun violence, the president said he was not resigned, and had faith that the country would eventually do the right thing on the matter: Gun violence, \u201cCosts this country dearly\u201d, Obama said. \u201cMore than 11,000 Americans were killed in 2013 alone. If congress had passed some common sense legislation after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom, reforms that 90% of the American people supported\u201d ... \u201c we might still have more Americans with us. We might have stopped one shooter. Some families might still be home. Y\u2019all might have to attend fewer funerals. And we should be strong enough to acknowledge this. We should be able to talk about this issue as citizens. Without demonizing gun owners, who are mostly law-abiding. ... Some reporters took this as resignation. I am not resigned. I have faith that we will eventually do the right thing. I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency. ... At some point as a country, we have to reckon with what happens. It\u2019s not enough to express sympathy. You don\u2019t see this kind of murder, on this scale, with this kind of frequency in other advanced countries on earth. ... What\u2019s different is that not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. I refuse to act as if this is the new normal.\u201d President Obama has addressed the Charleston attack at the US mayors conference: \u201cAs much as we grieve, this particular tragedy, it\u2019s important to step back and recognize that these tragedies have become far too commonplace.\u201d The vigil at the College of Charleston TD Arena will start at 6pm. The Department of Justice has announced that it is investigating whether the Charleston church slayings could be hate crime or domestic terror, the Associated Press is reporting. There has been much debate surrounding the definition of the crime committed at the Emanuel church, with some commenters arguing that the mass shooting should be classified as an act of terror. \u201cTerrorism, at least in our national imagination, springs from an ideology of insurgence,\u201d writes The Guardian\u2019s Jamiles Lartey. \u201cTerrorism is radical. It seeks to upset and overturn a society, and to shake it to its foundations. But in America, there are few ideologies less insurgent than the doctrine of white supremacy. [...]But, \u201cthe rush to pin some people\u2019s unwillingness to call the killings an act of terroron a subconscious bias towards or against the individual who committed the act obscures another important factor in how we choose to interpret, and in turn, identify them. Roof\u2019s alleged acts were, by all indications, driven by a violent and extremist interpretation of an ideology that is as old as America itself. The murder of nine innocent black people because of their race doesn\u2019t cut against the American grain in the same way that the spectre of Islamist terrorism does \u2013 it rides the grain all the way to its logical conclusion. Some new details of Wednesday night\u2019s events are beginning to emerge from the arrest warrants just released. Among the details are: Roof entered the church through a side entrance. Roof spent an hour studying with the parishioners at Emanuel church, before pulling out his .45 caliber handgun and striking his nine victims. All victims were hit multiple times. \u201cPrior to leaving the bible study room he stood over a witness to be named later, and uttered a racially inflammatory statement to the witness.\u201d The father and the uncle of the suspect identified him and his car to Charleston police after photographs of Roof leaving the building were released to the public. The suspect\u2019s father confirmed to police that the suspect owned a .45 caliber handgun. .45 caliber shell casings were recovered from the crime scene. Mullen warns that the flow of information will no longer be as quick as it was during the manhunt for Roof. He says the police force will not jeopardize the successful prosecution of Roof by giving out too much information, since the investigation is still ongoing. Wilson will not be taking questions. Charleston police chief Mullen is now speaking. Wilson recounts a phone call she received from senator Pinckney, in which he expressed support for her team\u2019s work. She said she and her staff will take inspiration from Pinckney\u2019s call during Roof\u2019s prosecution. Her priority are the victim\u2019s families, she says. \u201cThey need the time and space to mourn and to grieve, and we will give them that.\u201d \u201cNow is not the time to discuss the death penalty.\u201d Prosecutor Wilson is now speaking. \u201cWe will serve justice.\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s frustrating for yall, but as we move through this, the rules are different [in this case.]\u201d And she mentions the rules limit her from stating certain details of the case. Prosecutor Scarlett A Wilson is expected to address the media shortly. The emotional hearing lasted a total of 13 minutes, but we heard from the judge, family members of the shooting victims and from the suspect himself. Roof alternated between looking straight at the camera and down at his feet, expressing no emotion as consecutive family members of the victims continued to stand and offer the man \u2013 who allegedly murdered their sons, mothers and grandfathers \u2013 forgiveness. On the nine counts of murder, the judge says he does not have the authority to set bond. On the weapons charge, he sets bond for $1m. No representative of the Pinckney family is present to speak. The statements from the family members conclude. The sister of DePayne Middleton-Doctor says: I\u2019m a work in progress and I acknowledge that I\u2019m very angry. [DePayne] taught that we are the family that love built. We have no room for hate. So we have to forgive. I pray God for your soul. May God bless you. Alana Simmons, the granddaughter of Daniel Simmons, speaks next: Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof that they lived and loved. Hate won\u2019t win.\u201d Roof is simply staring at the ground throughout. Felicia Sanders, Tywanza Sanders\u2019s mother, speaks: We welcomed you Wednesday night to our Bible study. Every fibre in my body hurts. And I\u2019ll never be the same. Tywanza is my son, but he was my hero. But as we say in bible study, may God have mercy on your soul. Myra Thompson\u2019s relative, Anthony Thompson speaks, addressing Roof: We would like you to take this opportunity to repent. Repent. Confess. Give you life to Christ. So that he can change it. So that you can change your ways no matter hast happened to you, and you\u2019ll be OK. The judge asks whether there are any family members of the victims present, as they are allowed to make a statement to the court. Members are present from the families of Sharonda Singleton and Ethel Lance. Ethel Lance\u2019s daughter addresses Roof: I forgive you. You took something very precious from me. But I forgive you. Have mercy on your soul. You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people. May God forgive you. And I forgive you. Roof can be seen staring blankly at the ground, as the judge reads the list of charges. When addressed by the judge, he looks up at the camera. The judge tells Roof that his first court date is set for 23 October at 2pm. His second court appearance date: 5 February 2016 at 9am. Roof is told he has the right to a preliminary hearing. The judge now asks Roof questions, to clarify his age, his address and whether he is unemployed. Roof answers quietly but politely, addressing the judge as \u201cSir.\u201d He says he is 21 and he is unemployed. The judge says to the court, as Roof watches via video link: Charleston is a very strong community. We have big hearts. We are a very loving community and we are going to reach to everyone, all victims and we will touch them. We have victims, nine of them, but we also have victims on the other side. There are victims on this side of this young man\u2019s family. We must find it in our heart to not only help those who are victims but to also help his family as well. The judge has entered the courtroom. The suspect can be seen via video link, accompanied by two guards. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland sends these updates from outside the courthouse: Outside the the Centralized Bond Hearing Court in North Charleston, family members arrived in small groups for the hearing scheduled to start at 2pm. Some held hands and all were escorted by Charleston County Deputies in the sweltering 95 degree heat. None stopped to talk to the large crowd of media. The court is surrounded by officers who earlier had deployed a bomb squad and K-9 units to walk the perimeter of the facility. Dylann Roof is being held at the adjacent detention Center and will appear via videolink before Judge James Gosnell on nine counts of murder and firearms charges. Gosnell does not have the authority to set bond due to the severity of the charges. The small courtroom is expected to be so packed with family members that a second courtroom with video link is being made available to reporters before the hearing begins. While we wait for Dylann Roof to appear in court, my colleague Amanda Holpuch spent the morning in Columbia, where Roof lived as recently as march: No one answered the door on Friday at the home in Eastover, North Carolina, where Roof lived as recently as March. Lush plants, a stately American flag and a private property warning sign stood outside the property, which stands about 100 miles away from the site of the mass killing at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. \u201cHe just seemed real quiet and kept to himself,\u201d said Kim Fleming, manager of Mr Bunkys, the general store across the street on Garner\u2019s Ferry Road, a two-lane highway that is a popular route to South Carolina\u2019s coast. Fleming said she had met Roof several times. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it was someone walking around here,\u201d she said of the shooting. \u201cThis is not the norm.\u201d Read the full dispatch here. Family members of the Emanuel church shooting victims are arriving at the courthouse: Here\u2019s an updated summary on what we know so far: Dylann Roof, the suspect in the mass shooting of nine churchgoers has reportedly confessed to authorities. He has been charged with nine counts of murder and one weapons charge. Roof is set to appear at a bond hearing in Charleston at 2pm ET. This hearing is just a formality however, as the judge is unable to grant bond on a capital offense. NAACP national president Cornell William Brooks called the shooting an \u201cact of racial terrorism\u201d in a powerful speech on Friday. He also said that the confederate flag \u201cmust come down\u201d from the South Carolina state capitol. South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has voiced her support for the death penalty to be used in the case against Roof. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley however has said that he doesn\u2019t personally support the death penalty. A portrait of Dylann Roof as an apparently committed racist is emerging Interactive: what happened in the South Carolina church shooting? ABC4 reporter Stacy Jacobson reports that Roof is locked up in a cell next to Michael Slager \u2013 the police officer charged with killing unarmed black man Walter Scott: Meanwhile, out on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Friday he didn\u2019t know if the Charleston shooting was racially motivated, writes my colleague Sabrina Siddiqui: \u201cIt was a horrific act and I don\u2019t know what the background of it is, but it was an act of hatred,\u201d Bush told The Huffington Post. When pressed again, he still would not say. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Looks like to me it was, but we\u2019ll find out all the information,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it was an act of raw hatred, for sure. Nine people lost their lives, and they were African-American. You can judge what it is.\u201d Earlier Friday, Bush spoke at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, DC, an annual gathering of social conservatives. During his remarks, the former Florida governor paid tribute to the victims in Charleston. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was on the mind or the heart of the man who committed these atrocious crimes, but I do know what was in the heart of the victims,\u201d Bush said in his speech. \u201cThey were praying. They were learning and studying the word of the Lord. In times like these, in times of great of national mourning, people of faith, all of us must come together and at least reflect on this and fortify our strength and love of Christ, love of God to be able to continue to go forth.\u201d Bush added that the shooting had a \u201cbig impact\u201d on him and called on the audience to \u201ccontinue to bear witness to the truths that God acts through us.\u201d Bush was scheduled to campaign in Charleston on Thursday but canceled his events there immediately after news of the shooting emerged. \u201cA little bit of racism is a dangerous thing,\u201d Brooks says, to reporters\u2019 questions at the press conference. \u201cWhen are we going to turn things around?\u201d, Randolph says. He tells those thousands of African-American South Carolinians who are not registered to vote, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves, before encouraging everyone to register to vote in the next presidential election. \u201cControl what you can control,\u201d Randolph says of voting in presidential elections, including the removal of the confederate flag. Brooks has turned the mic over to Dr Lonnie Randolph Jr, the NAACP state president for South Carolina. The NAACP stands with the families of these victims, with this church. Leaves the crowd with this thought: the NAACP is 160 years old. \u201cWe were founded in the wake and in response to a former racialized violence called lynching,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cIn 2015, we are fighting, racial profiling, injustice in the criminal justice system. We will fight against this form of racial bigotry and violence, because we believe in this country and our constitution. And we believe this crime does not represent us.\u201d \u201cThis is not who we are.\u201d \u201cWe wil stand together in this moment of crisis.\u201d \u201cWe have to ask ourselves the question of, is this a matter of a lone shooter with a singular hatred?\u201d, Brooks said. \u201cIs the right terminology a lone shooter or a domestic terrorist?\u201d \u201cThis was an act of racial terrorism and must be treated as such.\u201d Brooks says the nation must examine the racial hate underlying the shooting. This wasn\u2019t just a shooting, said the NAACP leader, but a mass shooting: \u201cThis was a racial hate crime and must be confronted as such.\u201d South Carolina should not have the confederate flag waving in the state capitol, Brooks says. Some will assert that the confederate flag is merely a symbol of years gone by \u2013 a symbol of heritage, not hate. But when we see that symbol lifted up as an emblem of hate ... as an inspiration of violence, that symbol has to come down. That symbol has to be removed from our state capitol. Tensions over the flag that hangs at the state capitol have been renewed since the shooting, as my colleague Tom McCarthy reports. Brooks said this is a time for Americans to come to grips with its values and reckon with its policies. \u201cWhile there is a climate of caring, there is also an atmosphere of hate. If these exist side by side ... unless we address the underlying racial animus of this crime, we miss the point.\u201d \u201cThis tragedy hits close to home,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe come to this place at this moment, in this historic city,\u201d a city in which he said he spent a lot of time as a child as his grandfather and uncle owned barbershops not too far from Charleston. He grew up nearby in Georgetown. The idea that a pastor can gather his flock, to study the Bible in his church, he said, \u201cin that place, in that moment\u201d a stranger who was extended the hand of welcome, welcomed into the house of God could spend an hour in fellowship and study, and take up a gun and lay 9 people into untimely graves - tragic deaths - is \u201cunconscionable\u201d . \u201cIt is morally incomprehensible. It is a flesh and blood obscenity in our midst.\u201d We as a nation, are quite simply hocked by this crime. That it toko place in God\u2019s house, in the holy city of Charleston, North Carolina. \u201cIt is a living breahing contradiction This crime, is not merely crime perpetuated against a church, a pastor, against nine congregants. It is a hate crime. This is a hate crime, he said. \u201cWe are all as such victims.\u201d \u201cThis is a moment where those who indoctrinated, jho ;ed this young man down a racist path\u201d who taught him to embellish his car with a confederate flag, which is still at the state capitol, he notes . \u201cThis is a moment in which we say to them, that White Nationalist movement, the purveyors of hate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as Americans of every hue and heritage, will not subscribe to this hate.\u201d We will not be turned around by the religion of hatred. \u201cWhen wednesday night bible study reconvenes, you will find us there.\u201d Cornell Brooks is now speaking. The NAACP press conference has started. Charleston Chapter President Dot Scott and NAACP National president Cornell Brooks will speak Despite 24 hours of national grieving over the killing of nine churchgoers in Charleston, momentum toward fresh gun-control legislation remained at a near-standstill in Washington on Friday, write my colleagues Sabrina Siddiqui and Dan Roberts: White House officials claimed all possible presidential efforts had been \u201cexhausted\u201d after previous mass shootings and said Barack Obama did not anticipate action from Congress either, since he was \u201cvery realistic about the political realities\u201d. \u201cIf you go back to 2013, when the president worked very hard to exhaust every possible avenue to tackle this issue \u2013 in fact, we completed 23 executive actions \u2013 we didn\u2019t leave anything in the cupboard on steps that we could take to address this,\u201d spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters as Obama travelled to a political fundraiser in Los Angeles. Schultz\u2019s comments were even gloomier than Obama\u2019s had been during a brief statement on Thursday responding to the mass killings, in which he said the country would have to reckon with gun violence \u201cat some point\u201d but acknowledged that the \u201cpolitics in this town foreclose[d] a lot of those avenues right now\u201d. Read their full report here. The Guardian\u2019s Erin McCann writes that Obama\u2019s gloom might have to do with the fact that the president has had to address an incident of mass shooting more than a dozen times during his presidency: After Arizona, where congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot in the head, he spoke of hope. After Newtown, where 20 children and six teachers were shot dead in their classrooms, he spoke of a nation\u2019s broken heart. On Thursday, after nine people were shot dead in a church in Charleston, he spoke of despair. There are other shootings where Obama has remained silent, or not engaged with issue of guns or the cause of an event. But when he has, the president\u2019s responses have varied from anger to exasperation to sadness, nearly every time vowing that such events must not happen again. Read her full piece here. Michelle Obama has spoken out about the deadly Charleston church shooting while visiting military families at the Vicenza Air Base in Italy. \u201cMy heart goes out to the people of Emanuel, and to the people of Charleston. I pray for a community that I know is in pain, and with the hope that tragedies like this will one day come to an end.\u201d My colleague Oliver Laughland is at the courthouse in Charleston, ahead of Roof\u2019s 2pm hearing, where he spoke with April Cox, 29, from North Charleston: \u201cI came here to support Charleston, my community,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI\u2019m here for the victims, I\u2019m here to support them. I want to see justice even though we may not get it today, at this hearing.\u201d Cox said she did not know any of the victims. She is not sure she will get into the hearing, she said. Family members of the shooting victims are expected to come to the courthouse today. The Charleston branch of the NAACP will be holding a press conference at noon: Apart from the main vigil which will be held tonight announced by Riley, three other vigils will also be held: Adventist Community of Metro Charleston, Shiloh SDA Church Dorchester Waylan Community 3914 Dorchester Road, North Charleston Friday, June 19, 6 p.m. East Cooper Baptist Church, Worship Center 361 Egypt Road, Mount Pleasant Friday, June 19, 7 pm Without Walls Ministry Prayer Tent Located on the corner of Lee and Meeting Streets in Charleston Saturday, June 20, 7 p.m. We will update this post with information if more vigils are announced. The mayor\u2019s press conference is now over. Mayor Riley addressed media questions about the nature of race relations in Charleston. \u201cWe in America are never taught African-American history,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the story.\u201d He said people are not taught about the history of slavery and the Jim Crow period. Riley said that there is a plan in place to build an International African American Museum in Charleston. \u201cThere are lots of things we can do in our country to enhance the dialogue about race. \u201cTo get out of the minds of evil people\u201d, the hateful thoughts, like Roof\u2019s. But Riley concedes it\u2019s very difficult to do so. Asked about the racism in his city, Riley said that \u201cCharleston is a loving community,\u201d and one where all different communities live very closely together, for which Charlestonians are grateful. Roof, Riley reminds the crowd, didn\u2019t grow up in Charleston but came [to Charleston] from 100 miles away. His actions are not representative of this community, he adds. Asked about Governor Haley\u2019s comments on the death penalty, Mayor Riley says he is not personally a proponent of the death penalty - even though this case would merit it. He said he is of the belief that the death penalty \u201ccollectively, over time, adds to the violence.\u201d But that\u2019s the law in South Carolina, he said, and he has no control over it. Riley gave an update on the Mother Emanuel Hope fun, set up to help the families of \u201cthe victims to handle the great expenses, as well as the church\u201d. Pinckney had been trying to raise funds to build an elevator in the church. There will be another fund that will allow us to address Pinckney\u2019s projects for the church. (E.g. To repair the church\u2019s steeple), Riley says. He got a call this morning of a $25,000 donation from a foundation. And there has been an outpouring from citizens in the community and from the country at large, he says. \u201cWe are in a period of loving and healing for all those who have been so terribly injured in our hearts by this tragic event.\u201d Mayor Riley is now addressing the media. Riley praises the community for coming together, for helping each other. A community vigil will be held tonight, around the corner. He says it will be a chance to talk and think about the tragic events and allow the families to be there, within the \u201cbosom of this community\u201d and to \u201cfeel the love, support and encouragement\u201d. Riley says he wanted the vigil to be held in a location close to the site of the shooting. Details of the vigil: College of Charleston TD Arena 66 George St., Charleston Friday, June 19, 6 pm My colleague Lauren Gambino with more on Roof\u2019s charges: During the hearing, the judge will inform Roof of the nature of the charges against him. Roof is not required to enter a plea during the bond hearing, though if he as confessed as media reports indicate, he may, based on his lawyers\u2019 advice. Under South Carolina law, a magistrate cannot set bond for a defendant who has been charged with a capital offense, or an offense that could carry a life sentence. In such cases, bond must be set by a Circuit Court Judge. However, it\u2019s more likely the presiding magistrate judge will deny Roof bail, given the nature of his charges. Roof\u2019s case qualifies for the death penalty. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley will give a press conference in a few minutes, where he is expected to announce details of a prayer vigil held tonight at the TD Arena at 6pm. Chief Magistrate James Gosnell will preside over Roof\u2019s bond hearing, according to Live5 News police reporter Herve Jacobs. Judge JC Nicholson Jr will preside over the case, according to this order obtained by Jacobs: According to the South Carolina courts website, Judge JC \u201cBuddy\u201d Nicholson. Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1942, Nicholson attended college in South Carolina, getting his law degree from the University of South Carolina. Nicholson is a retired Lt Colonel who served as a US air force pilot for five years from 1965-1970 and then in the National Guard until 1989. He has been a judge since 1999, and has been Judge of the Tenth Judicial Circuit since 2001. A spokeswoman for the Office of the Solicitor of the ninth judicial circuit confirmed to the Guardian that Roof has been charged with nine counts of homicide and the weapons charge. Some details are emerging about the case: According to media reports, Dylann Roof has been charged with 9 counts of murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime (per Charleston PD). The prosecutor in the case is Scarlett A Wilson, a solicitor with the 9th circuit court. Roof will be reportedly be represented by Chief Public Defender Ashley Pennington. New questions were emerging on Friday about how Roof acquired the firearm that he allegedly used in the attack at the historic church. On Thursday, the day after the attack, Carson Cowles \u2013 who identified himself as Roof\u2019s uncle \u2013 told Reuters that Roof\u2019s father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a present for his 21st birthday last April. But law enforcement officials familiar with the details of the investigation have told CNN that Roof purchased the gun himself in April: What is known, is that Roof has a recent criminal history. The Lexington county district attorney\u2019s office confirmed that Roof had been charged with possession of a controlled substance in March but the circumstances surrounding that arrest remain unclear. He was also arrested in April for misdemeanour trespassing in Lexington county. The city of North Charleston has announced that flags will fly at half-staff for nine days, in honor of the nine victims of the church shooting: Roof is scheduled to appear in court today at 2pm, at the Charleston County Centralized Bond Court in North Charleston. He is expected to be charged with nine counts of murder, one for each of his African American victims. My colleague Lauren Gambino confirmed with a court clerk that Roof will appear via video link from his jail cell. This is what will happen during the hearing, via the court\u2019s website: First, the defendant is advised of the nature of the charges and is also advised of the rights afforded to him by the law. Second, a bond is set by the magistrate. If a defendant is charged with a capital offense, or one which might be punishable by life imprisonment, however, the magistrate, by law, cannot set the bond. It must be set by a Circuit Court Judge. Also, the magistrate might deny bond in certain cases involving violent crimes. Roof is currently being held at the Al Cannon detention center in North Charleston having been flown back to the scene of Wednesday night\u2019s carnage at the Emanuel AME church, writes Ed Pilkington: Authorities said that Roof was being kept in isolation away from other people at the jail. He was also being kept on suicide watch for his own protection, they said. The suspect in the shooting has confessed to carrying out the attack, according to media reports, my colleague Ed Pilkington reports from Charleston: CNN is reporting that it has been told by two law enforcement officials that Dylann Roof has told authorities that he was the shooter. NBC reported the same. The Guardian cannot confirm this. According to the CNN account, the 21-year-old resident of Columbia, South Carolina, said that his motive had been that he wanted to start a race war.
