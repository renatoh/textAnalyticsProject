The Renault team claimed the front row when Giancarlo Fisichella's final lap beat the best that McLaren and Kimi Raikkonen could manage. The biggest disappointment, not only for Ferrari but also anyone hoping for an end to Alonso's run of success, was Michael Schumacher's fifth-fastest time, as the former champion had difficulty making his Bridgestone tyres match the best Michelin could offer. 'The car has been perfect from the start,' said Alonso. 'The track has been getting more and more grip and we thought Ferrari would be quicker today. Today has been a more realistic indication of where Ferrari are. It seems we have something more than them. The team has done a good job and I have to say that Michelin have given us a good tyre. But qualifying is only the start of the weekend and we need to do a good job during the 70 laps of the race. 'But this has been encouraging because this is a track where you need to have really low downforce on the car to go quickly on the straights - and our car is working here too. It feels completely different to drive and you need to change your style of driving. There is more risk and it is more challenging from a driver's point of view. You are close to the wall. It is high speed; not easy. You really feel more adrenaline, that's for sure.' Raikkonen said the car felt much better than at any stage in the weekend, but he was disappointed not to have been able to match the Renaults. 'I was expecting more,' said Raikkonen. 'We changed the car a little bit for qualifying. We reduced the wing [to reduce drag and find more speed] but maybe took off too much because the car was sliding too much. But it's not really a worry for the race.' The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve presents unique problems for the drivers and teams. Following the edge of a man-made island in the middle of the St Lawrence River, the 2.7-mile track is hardly used from one Grand Prix to the next. Coupled with the ravages of the Canadian winter, drivers are faced with a circuit that is not dirty to the naked eye but, in F1 terms, is deceptively dusty and slippery. Several drivers had lurid moments during practice on Friday and the lack of grip was not helped by comparatively cool temperatures. The temptation was to waste time attempting - and usually failing - to make the car work, only to find that the conditions had changed and improved during yesterday's practice, so much so that drivers and their engineers virtually had to start from scratch. Schumacher and Ferrari seemed to be suffering more than most on Friday, the former champion running wide and missing the entrance to the final chicane on more than one occasion. Schumacher and his fellow strugglers were lucky to have the inside of the chicane now laid with a solid base as opposed to a gravel run-off which used to trap the unwary. Marc Surer, a former F1 driver and now broadcaster for Swiss television, shook his head as he watched from the commentary position overlooking the chicane. 'The drivers are using that runoff as if it's part of the track,' said Surer. 'If there was a big wall there, you simply wouldn't make a mistake and you would have to treat it with respect. I'm not saying drivers should get hurt or anything like that. But it's too easy for them now.' It is a valid point. The corner in question is one of the most difficult on a track with no fewer than five chicanes. Drivers approach at 195 mph and the entrance to the chicane is barely discernible as the track goes right and then immediately left. The straight leading into the corner has been the focus of more attention than usual, as terminal speeds are studied in the light of a change introduced to the cars at this race. Suspicious that some teams may have been allowing their rear wings to flex in defiance of the regulations, but as a means of creating less aerodynamic drag at high speed, officials have demanded that all cars carry a separator, or a wedge, on the rear wing to prevent this happening. It was felt that teams were, literally, bending the rules and finding as much as an extra 5 mph on the straights. Either way, Renault remain the team to beat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
