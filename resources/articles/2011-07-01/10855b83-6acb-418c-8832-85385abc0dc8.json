Performing with the Ballet Boyz, Russell Maliphant, Akram Khan and Robert Lepage, Guillem seems to have been on a personal mission to learn new dance idioms and new dance cultures. For this latest project, however, it is Guillem herself who is the inspiration, commissioning two very different choreographers to make work specifically for the 46-year-old dancer. William Forsythe, who has created several ballets for Guillem, has opted into a rare return to his classical roots, choreographing the pure dance duet Rearray for Guillem and Nicolas Le Riche, her partner at Paris Opera Ballet. Mats Ek is also a long-time collaborator and for this new intimate solo, Aj\u00f6 (Bye), he has the ballerina interacting with live video as she meditates on the excitement and poignancy of transitions. Also contributing to the evening is the Czech choreographer Jiri Kyli\u00e1n, whose duet from his work 27' 52\" is performed by dancers from Nederlands Dans Theater Sadler's Wells, EC1, Tue to 9 Jul Dancing City, London The Greenwich + Docklands International Festival programmes 8 days of outdoor dance events, opening up the parks and public spaces of Canary Wharf to an international range of companies. On Saturday, under the Dancing City umbrella, dancers from English National Ballet perform Hans van Manen's Trois Gnossiennes, set to Satie's score; while at the other extreme, Motionhouse stages a work with cranes and a JCB digger. In between are works featuring a 1963 Lambretta (Lance And Brenda) and a washing machine (Compagnie Mar G\u00f3mez's comedy about laundry and machismo, inspired by Italian 1950s cinema). There's also a performance by Pied En Sol, and a collaboration of dance, sign language and live painting, with Rachel Gadsden and the performers of Deaf Men Dancing. Canary Wharf, E14, Sat Hot Ice, Blackpool Running since 2005, this show has set the bar high for ice dancing: a concentration of glitzy costumes, intricate formations and virtuoso solos from 28 international champion skaters. Unlike the recent spate of ballet-inspired shows, this one focuses purely on the costumes and the dancing \u2013 all of which reference a wide, colourful world of styles. The opening number is in shameless showgirl style, the chorus of women dressed in a Las Vegas uniform of headdresses and rhinestone-studded unitards. From there the choreography moves to rock'n'roll (Argentinian dancer Juan Carlos Acosta surrounded by 12 girls in big skirts) to circus skills on skates to ballroom-on-ice variants on the rumba, salsa and waltz. A mass tango routine and a Follies-girls finale justify the show's title. The Arena, Wed to 4 Sep"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
