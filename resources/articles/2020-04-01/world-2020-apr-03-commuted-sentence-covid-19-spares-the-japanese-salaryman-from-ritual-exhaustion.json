But in Japan, as in other parts of the world, the coronavirus pandemic has forced even the most conservative companies to rethink the way they do business in a country that has been reluctant to embrace the idea of working from home. \u201cI used to commute for an hour in either direction, so I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do that for the time being,\u201d Okada, who is in his late 40s, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd holding meetings online hasn\u2019t been a problem.\u201d Okada, an employee of a major company in Tokyo, started working from home two days a week from late February, but has been working remotely full-time since the end of March, amid a sharp rise in reported Covid-19 infections in the capital. Ironically his firm, which employs more than 40,000 people, had already made plans for staff to work from home several times a month to ease congestion during the Tokyo Olympics, now postponed for a year due to the outbreak. \u201cOf course there are times when I have to be in the office, but I can see us continuing with telework for, say, two days a week,\u201d he said, adding that about 80% of his colleagues were now working remotely. The pandemic has forced companies to implement changes the government has been encouraging for several years, in the hope that less demanding office hours would enable more women to return to work after giving birth and men to be more involved in housework and childcare. But few companies followed the government\u2019s advice. A survey last year found that 19% had given staff the option of teleworking, but just 8.5% had taken it up. Resistance to working from home stems from a corporate culture that values employees being present in the workplace, often for punishingly long hours, to demonstrate their loyalty. \u201cThe Japanese still have this image that telework isn\u2019t real work, because you\u2019re not physically in the office,\u201d said Haruka Kazama, an economist at the Mizuho research institute. While Japan has so far avoided the large number of infections and deaths seen in the US, Europe and China, the outbreak is challenging the traditional image of besuited, exhausted salaryman falling asleep on packed commuter trains following after-hours drinks with colleagues. \u201cThe situation has put companies\u2019 backs against the wall,\u201d Kazama said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been forced to give their employees the choice to telework.\u201d Shortly after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called for staggered commutes and teleworking at the end of February, a poll by Keidanren, a business lobby representing about 400 major firms, found that almost 70% had either implemented teleworking or were planning to do so. Hitachi has introduced teleworking for 50,000 employees of its group companies in Tokyo, while the advertising agency Dentsu closed its Tokyo headquarters and ordered its 5,000 staff to work from home after an employee tested positive for the virus. Daiwa Securities, with about 10,000 employees, introduced home-based teleworking for staff with small children. The pandemic also enabled employees to experiment with a healthier work-life balance. Yuki Sato, an employee of a start-up in Tokyo, has set up a small office at the home he shares with his wife and two children. Teleworking means he no longer has to endure a long commute and has more time for his daughters, whose schools are closed due to the outbreak. \u201cI can also give them their bath in the evening, something I could never do before because I was never home before 8pm,\u201d Sato, who has been working from home since February, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cThis experience has completely changed my image of teleworking.\u201d Teleworking has sparked a boost in sales of items such as web cameras and headphones, but some old analogue habits die hard. In an age of electronic contracts, many Japanese companies still require employees to print out documents that are then stamped with official hanko seals, often by several people. Mariko Kitano, who works for a TV production company, believes the last few weeks have proved that more flexible working practices should continue long after the coronavirus crisis has subsided. \u201cThere are times when you have to go into the office, but about 80% of my colleagues have been working from home since late February,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI live alone, so I\u2019ve found teleworking really useful. I meet my deadlines, of course, but I can take a break now and then to do things like hang out the laundry.\u201d There are times, though, when teleworking is no substitute for face-to-face contact, Kitano added. \u201cI\u2019m mentoring junior colleagues and it\u2019s sometimes frustrating not to be able to see what they\u2019re doing and offer advice in person. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we can go back to the way things were, despite the traditional view in Japan that you can only prove your worth by working hard in front of your boss. The past few weeks have proved that teleworking has too many advantages to be ditched.\u201d *Okada and Kitano\u2019s names have been changed at their request.
