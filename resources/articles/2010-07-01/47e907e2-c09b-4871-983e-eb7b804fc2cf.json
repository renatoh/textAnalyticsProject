The Millthorpe Project has put a series of interviews with gay trade unionists into the British Library's sound archive. They tell stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in pursuit of the right to be honest about their sexuality. Dr Bob Cant Millthorpe Project, Brighton \u2022 Simon Jenkins is perplexed at the claim on treasury funds of \"another study in nautical imagery in late Conrad\" (If a three-year gap is to pass for higher education, 16 July). Asked what his subject contributed to national defence, Robert Wilson replied: \"It makes the country worth defending.\" Richard Sykes Cambridge \u2022 It seems remarkably prescient of the BBC to be showing a programme about a Victorian pharmacy (TV review, G2, 16 July) so soon after Andrew Lansley's white paper on proposed reforms for the NHS. Perhaps some of the new, privately owned universities could run courses for trainee apothecaries. Gordon Watson Melbourn, Hertfordshire \u2022 Slow reading may be only half of the problem (Read this slowly, G2, 15 July). Promiscuous use of cut-and-paste and slapdash finger-led keystroke English lead to incomprehensible composition. We may be losing the ability to express what we mean. Throw out the computer and keyboard! But almost all education establishments require all work to be printed out from a computer. Professors could challenge these rules. Adrin Neatrour Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 Was the Amalthea in Israeli waters or on the high seas when Israel's naval forces threatened violence (Israel blocks Libyan ship taking aid to Gaza, 15 July)? If the latter, Israel may have committed an act of piracy, and the international community must surely put out armed boats to protect those who sail on the high seas.
