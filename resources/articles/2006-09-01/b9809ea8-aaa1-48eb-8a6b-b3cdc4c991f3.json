It is in these unspinnable cues that the passing of power will be evident for all to see. Like skilled poker players, politicians try to manipulate their image by controlling the subtle physical signs they give off. But they are not always successful, according to Peter Collett, an expert on body language, formerly of Oxford University. Poker players and politicians reveal what is really going on with physical tics or \"tells\". Blair, for example, reveals when he is anxious by fiddling with his little finger and touching his tummy. \"It takes us back to a point in our lives when we are babies. When babies are distressed mothers often rub their tummies to calm them down and to comfort them,\" Dr Collett said. \"Tony's mummy is not around to comfort him so he does it himself.\" Those cues are probably involuntary, but he suspects that President Bush's exaggerated \"power-walk\" is put on in an attempt to impress. The knuckle-dragging swing of the arms, the languid simian gait and the palms facing backwards are all part of showing off who is boss. \"This is not how normal people walk,\" Dr Collett told the British Association Festival of Science. \"[It is] to convey an impression of his masculinity and therefore his power.\" And it seems to work, at least on the bedazzled Mr Blair. While in the president's company Mr Blair frequently puts both hands in his front pockets - a sure sign of subordination and nerves. \"[Blair] only does that when he feels subordinate to the person he's with,\" he said. President Bush's own sign that things are not right is to bite the inside of his left lip. He did this during the walk with Bill Clinton to the podium for his first inauguration ceremony and he did it during his visit to meet the Queen in 2003. But the most fruitful relationship for study has been the \"endless game of political poker\" between the prime minister and Gordon Brown. When Mr Blair speaks the chancellor looks uncomfortable. During the prime minister's party conference speech in 2003 Mr Brown gave off 322 \"discomfort tells\", including touching his hair, fiddling with his cuffs and looking at the floor. Watch carefully this year and Mr Blair and Mr Brown might give away more about the power handover than they mean to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
