But the BBC is convinced that for the majority of the 26 million viewers who rely on its forecasters for their weather information in the average month, the change is overdue. The now familiar graphics employed in one form or another since 1936, when hand-drawn weather maps were produced in crayon, have been jettisoned for a hi-tech, virtual reality effect. It is described by the BBC as the most radical change in 30 years and the first substantial update since the old magnetic symbols synonymous with Michael Fish, Bill Giles and Ian McCaskill were replaced in 1985 by computer graphics. The virtual reality system allows the forecaster to swoop beneath the clouds and move around the country or the world, with dark shadows on the map representing heavy cover and shafts of light denoting sunshine. Realistic rainfall becomes heavier as conditions worsen and shadows move across the map as the sun goes down. Colin Tregear, the BBC Weather Centre's project director, said the system, licensed from New Zealand's met office, allowed forecasts to be far more precise and localised in their predictions. Helen Young, the BBC's lead presenter, said: \"The use of 3D graphics means we can zoom into areas where weather conditions are bad, or particularly interesting, and provide a much closer view.\" Whereas the current symbols could be difficult to understand when trying to explain complex weather conditions and are imprecise because they cover an area of about 100 miles on the map, the new system is designed to be more flexible. Mr Tregear said audience research had shown that while people trusted the BBC's forecasts they found the graphics \"old fashioned\" and \"boring\". \"The concept is to show the things that people care about - 'Is the weather going to be hotter, drier, wetter than it was today in the place that I live?'\" he said. Information received directly from the Met Office will be automatically translated by a central computer and fed to the BBC's national, regional, radio and internet services. Based on their own information, the forecasters can tweak the predictions and update forecasts at the click of a mouse. Previously, the forecasts could differ depending on conflicting interpretations of the information around the country. \"This is designed to streamline the whole process and provide far greater consistency,\" said Mr Tregear. The BBC refused to say how much the Metra system cost but the investment was substantially higher than the \u00a350 spent on \"an easel and treatment to walls for background\" prior to the first forecaster's onscreen appearance in January 1954. Then George Cowling became the first person to present a forecast on British television, speaking live to the country for five minutes. Audience figures show that despite the proliferation of television channels and websites, millions rely on BBC forecasts for their weather news. In April, it is calculated that 26.3 million people would have seen at least one weather forecast on BBC1 or BBC2. Many more are turning to the BBC website for updates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
