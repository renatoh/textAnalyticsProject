But that does not apply to the coalition's decision on which company wins the contract to build 1,200 Thameslink train carriages \u2013 there the truth is surely that the left hand knows perfectly well what the right is up to but could not give a stuff. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have both talked long, hard and well about their desire to \"rebalance the economy\". George Osborne kicked off his last budget with a speech about the \"march of the makers\". Yet when it comes to the crunch \u2013 when the government is actually in a position to put its taxpayers' money where its collective mouth is \u2013 it does no such thing. Rather than award the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink contract to Bombardier, a firm that would do more of the value-added work at its plant in Derby, Philip Hammond and Vince Cable chose to anoint Siemens, which will build the trains in Germany, as their preferred bidder. The result, says Bombardier, is that 1,400 jobs will be lost in Derby \u2013 which amounts to nearly half the workforce. Over 400 of them will be permanent posts. True, Siemens says it will bring 2,000 jobs to the UK \u2013 but only 300 of those will be the most valuable directly employed manufacturing jobs. In other words, whatever the government may say it wants to do to encourage job creation amid this slump and to tilt the economy away from finance towards manufacturing and other sectors, it does not intend to do much, bar the usual fluff about creating the right economic environment for business. Either the coalition wants a manufacturing revival or it does not. Either it wants to play strictly by the rules of the free market or it does not. This is not one of those areas in which ministers can offer up a pleasing policy fudge. It simply does not wash for Mr Hammond to complain that he was simply following the terms of a tender drawn up by Gordon Brown's government \u2013 if they were not congenial to the transport secretary he could have changed them. It will not do for Mr Cable to openly admit that France and Germany apply the EU rules on procurement to their advantage, and then to go ahead and play by the rulebook anyway. This is much bigger than one contract: the Thameslink trains are merely the precursor for the \u00a316bn Crossrail route. This is also much bigger than one factory \u2013 at stake here is the economic livelihood of an entire city. Labour is as guilty of free-market fundamentalism as any other party, but John Denham and Maria Eagle are right to oppose this decision. There is a lot more riding on this issue than a bunch of commuters going from Bedford to Brighton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
