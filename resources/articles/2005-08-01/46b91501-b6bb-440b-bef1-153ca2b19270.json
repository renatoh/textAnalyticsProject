While police sources remained confident that Hussein Osman would be sent back to London, it was announced that the man suspected of attempting a bomb attack at Shepherd's Bush was to face Italian charges of terrorism and possession of false passports. The confusion arose as police in London mounted a major armed operation around mainline and underground stations amid fears of further attacks on the capital. Twenty people were being interviewed by police in London and Sussex as senior officers warned of a \"continuing threat\". In a move that will have dismayed British authorities, a judge in Rome yesterday ordered that Ethiopian-born Hussein Osman, known in Italy as Hamdi Issac, be remanded in custody while prosecutors prepare a case against him in Italy for international terrorist conspiracy. Legal sources had earlier said that such a ruling could override the international arrest warrant issued in Britain which was upheld by another Rome judge on Sunday. \"We want him back,\" said a police source in London last night. Scotland Yard remains confident that it will succeed in its extradition attempts but there remains a worry about whether Italian prosecutors will agree to let him be brought back to London speedily enough for him to help in the current phase of the investigation. \"Our understanding is that everything is still on track,\" a Home Office spokeswoman said last night. She said that there remained \"some confusion\" over the initial reports of the charges in Rome. Italy's Ansa news agency said last night that an extradition hearing for Hamdi Issac was unlikely to be held before the end of August and could be delayed until early September. Domenicomassimo Miceli, the appeal court judge responsible for the extradition proceedings, said the authorities in London had until next Sunday to produce certain documents he needed in order to set a date for the hearing. In the unlikely event these documents failed to arrive, Hamdi Issac would be set free. However, a senior Italian police official also said yesterday that he believed extradition would \"not take long\". Carlo De Stefano appeared to question the need for keeping the suspect in Italy. \"The investigative evidence collected so far does not support the theory that there are links with other terrorist inquiries carried out in Italy or with terrorist organisations active in the country,\" Mr De Stefano said. He added that Osman appeared to be \"more part of an ad hoc group than a structured organisation with broad terrorist aims\". Osman left for the continent after the bombings. On Saturday, the interior minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, told MPs that the suspect had relied on a \"tightly knit\" support network. But yesterday Mr De Stefano said his contacts in Italy were \"solely and exclusively to do with family and friends\". He said Osman had changed his name from Issac when he left Italy for Britain and claimed he was from Somalia to win refugee status. The newspaper La Repubblica yesterday published an interview with his Italian former girlfriend, who said that as a teenager he had been \"obsessed\" with American ghetto culture. Yesterday's hearing was held behind closed doors in the city's Regina Coeli prison, where Osman and his brother, Remzi, have been held since their arrest on Friday. His court-appointed lawyer, Antonietta Sonnessa, told reporters that her client also faced a charge of possessing forged documents. Fresh details emerged yesterday of how Osman had been tracked to Italy. He is understood to have left Britain on July 26 by Eurostar from Waterloo station without having to show his passport. However, it was possible not only to trace him via his mobile phone signals but also to record his voice so that it could be ascertained whether or not he was the man the police were hunting. In London, police continued to question the three other July 21 bombing suspects amid unconfirmed reports that at least one of them was cooperating. A total of 20 people are being detained in connection with the investigation, including three women. Last night armed police arrested two men following raids on three addresses in Stockwell and Clapham, south London. Seven people arrested in Brighton over the weekend were still being interviewed as to whether they had provided logistical support or had harboured any of the suspects. Once again there was a large police presence on the streets and in the underground network of London, with armed officers patrolling mainline stations with submachine guns. The operation is likely to continue at its present level at least until the end of this week. \"There is a threat and a continuing threat,\" said a police source. \"We are keen to guard against any feeling that people can relax and drop their guard. You are going to see an increased police presence on the streets for the foreseeable future.\" Civil rights groups and lawyers have approached the attorney general and urged him to issue an informal warning to establish self-restraint by the print and broadcast media. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty said that there was concern about the continued use of photos of the suspects, details of their backgrounds and, in some media coverage, the use of the word \"bombers\" rather than suspects or alleged bombers. A spokesman for the attorney general said: \"The attorney has kept the reporting of this story under active consideration from its very beginning. He is determined to ensure that any trials that arise are fair. The fact of the arrests means that the strict liability rule for contempt of court now applies.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
