Age 8+ This week, it's books for Refugee Week (June 16-22). The Arrival pays tribute to refugees everywhere. It's a sophisticated, wordless picture book that begins with a man leaving his wife and child to find work in a faraway country. It tells its story in a sequence of interlinked images, reminiscent of a sepia-tinted photo album. The reader's experience, as he or she tries to make sense of unfamiliar scenes and strange images, parallels that of the migrant, striving to understand without the aid of language. This extraordinarily accomplished piece of storytelling can be read and understood on many different levels. Gervelie's Journey: A Refugee Diary Anthony Robinson and Annemarie Young, illustrated by June Allan Frances Lincoln. \u00a311.99. Age 5-8 Gervelie's Diary is more straightforward, but will have an equally powerful impact on a younger audience. It relates with understated poignancy the true story of a young child fleeing militia attacks and civil war in west Africa. Illustrated by an evocative combination of photographs and watercolours, it offers a happy ending of sorts: Gervelie and her father are now settled in Norwich. Nevertheless, its portrayal of belligerent British immigration officials offers a salutary reminder of the work still to be done before Refugee Week achieves its aims. \u00b7 Win a book for your school.
