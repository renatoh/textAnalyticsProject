Having watched his England captain, Dylan Hartley, land himself in further trouble the night before, Jones was able to watch how an alternative arrangement might work. Not that Sale bore much comparison to the sort of opposition Saracens\u2019 luminaries might face on the fields of international rugby but the way they dispatched the Sharks on a wet evening was ruthless and precise, qualities that go down well in Test rugby. The victory was built round Saracens\u2019 lineout, which was dominant to a degree rarely seen at European level. Jamie George, whose form has for some time outstripped that of Hartley, once again hit his targets at each of the myriad lineouts, where he picked out George Kruis as often as anyone. \u201cWe get through a lot of work with the hookers at England, whoever it is,\u201d Kruis said of the various relationships he has developed at club and international level. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jamie for a long time, so there\u2019s definitely a good partnership there, but whoever we\u2019re put in with, it\u2019s always a pleasure.\u201d If Jones is pondering a change of captaincy, Owen Farrell continues to set the tone. He was withdrawn, curiously, a minute into the second half, much to his disgust. Mark McCall explained that there was slight tightness in the player\u2019s quad but the reason he returned him for those 60 seconds after half-time was that his leadership in the changing room had been so clear and cogent it just did not feel right not to let him go out with the others for the second half. That is some endorsement. Kruis agrees that Farrell has the right qualities. \u201cFor a start Dyls has led the [England] team unbelievably well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of leaders in the team \u2013 and Owen\u2019s one of them. Billy [Vunipola] is another. Mike Brown. All these guys are big leaders. Owen\u2019s the benchmark of where we want to be. He\u2019s a good leader, he\u2019s smart and he\u2019s a good player.\u201d Not that Saracens were screaming out for direction during half-time. There are as many leaders in this side as there are in the England set-up. It is true they were only two tries to the good at the break but at 26-3 the bonus point seemed inevitable and the win was in the bag. They had had two tries disallowed, correctly, by the TMO by then but tries three and four followed within 10 minutes of the resumption. McCall was more exercised by the fact that some of his players were having to play in Europe the week after they had finished the autumn internationals. Following a 50-point win he could make the case more vocally than his counterparts at Leicester and Northampton. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that these fourth internationals are at the end of the window, instead of the start. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to ask the players to back up. In the long run there shouldn\u2019t be a fourth international a week before we go into Europe.\u201d As ever, the players themselves are more phlegmatic. Kruis said: \u201cI think it\u2019s all right. We\u2019re fairly well looked after. You do reach some emotional highs playing in these big games. The coaching team understand that and gave us an extra day off. From my point of view, I\u2019m pretty happy.\u201d Steve Diamond was not, though. Sale\u2019s director of rugby refused to engage with the media afterwards any more than his team had got to grips with this assignment, which was not at all. Josh Charnley, the rugby league recruit, had a good day under the many high balls that came his way and saved one of those disallowed tries but otherwise there was little to encourage the visitors. It is turning into a horror season for them. They need all the help they can get.
