Speaking at an event in Adelaide, Philip Lowe said \u201cvery low\u201d household income growth was the reason the economy had \u201csoftened\u201d, which has prompted the RBA to reduce interest rates to a record low of 1.25%. Asked for his view on the role of income support levels, Lowe suggested an increase to the $277.85-a-week payment would help stimulate the economy, though it was \u201ca matter for the government\u201d. \u201cAnything at the moment that can boost income growth is good for the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the interest rate cuts will boost household disposable income because people pay a lot of interest, and I hope the tax rebates get through the parliament and that will boost income. \u201cAnd perhaps, in time, stronger support payments for unemployed people will help as well but that\u2019s up to the government.\u201d Lowe\u2019s remarks buoyed the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), which said they \u201cconfirm that increasing Newstart would boost growth in incomes and the economy\u201d. Single Newstart recipients are currently expected to survive on $40 a day, plus very minor supplementary payments. \u201cIf you ask someone on Newstart what they\u2019d spend an increase on and you ask a high-income earner what they\u2019d spend a tax cut on, you get very different answers,\u201d the Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said. \u201cPeople on Newstart, on the other hand, have no choice but to spend everything they have in order to get by \u2013 they simply can\u2019t save any money or even afford to pay off debts.\u201d In his speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in Adelaide, Lowe flagged another potential rate cut as he warned of \u201cspare capacity\u201d in the labour market, including \u201csignificant underemployment\u201d. \u201cAs a country we should also be looking at other ways to get closer to full employment,\u201d he said. \u201cOne option is fiscal policy, including through spending on infrastructure. Another is structural policies that support firms expanding, investing, innovating and employing people.\u201d Melinda Cilento, the CEDA chief executive, said Lowe\u2019s presentation suggested \u201cnow is as good a time as ever\u201d for an increase to Newstart. Acoss\u2019s proposal to lift the payment by $75 a week would cost the federal budget $3.3bn a year, while boosting consumer spending, Deloitte said last year. Separate Acoss research has found 44% of people on Newstart were on it for more than two years and 15% for more than five years. The government has so far declined to consider an increase to Newstart, despite calls from the Business Council, John Howard and, most recently, the Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos. Labor took a review of social security payments to the election, a move that was expected to lead to a boost in income support rates. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, was contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
