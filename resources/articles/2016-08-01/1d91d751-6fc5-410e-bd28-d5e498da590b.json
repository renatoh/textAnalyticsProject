The Austin-based university\u2019s students and faculty have been at the vanguard of resistance to the \u201ccampus carry\u201d rule passed by the Republican-dominated Texas legislature last year. In a grim coincidence, the bill went into effect as several hundred people gathered for a memorial ceremony in the shadow of the tower at the heart of the campus from where a sniper, Charles Whitman, embarked on a 96-minute killing spree. The law permits people over 21 with handgun licenses to carry a concealed handgun in most buildings on campus, including classrooms and, at some universities, dorm rooms. Areas considered sensitive, such as sports arenas and laboratories with dangerous chemicals, are designated as gun-free zones, as is the UT tower\u2019s observation deck. Gregory Fenves, the university president, told reporters at a press conference on Monday that he recognized \u201cthere is some confusion\u201d about implementation, but \u201cour message to the entire campus community [has] always been \u2018if you see a gun call the police\u2019 and that has not changed\u201d. Eight states allow the carrying of concealed weapons on higher education campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Texas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin. In 23 states, institutions have the right to choose. Texas\u2019s law does not apply to private universities, all but one of which have decided to ban campus carry, the Texas Tribune reported. \u2018I hope they get guns off this campus\u2019 Claire Wilson James was the first passerby shot by Whitman from the deck of the tower on 1 August 1966. Then aged 18, she was eight months pregnant and gravely injured. The bullet ripped through her stomach and killed her unborn boy. Then 25-year-old Whitman fatally shot her boyfriend. \u201cI just hope they get guns off this campus and get rid of open carry and let the police have the guns if somebody has to have them,\u201d she said after the ceremony. James hopes America\u2019s gun culture will follow the same path as smoking \u2013 a habit once widespread and viewed as normal but now declining in popularity and often viewed as socially unacceptable and dangerous. \u201cI think that pretty soon people will go \u2018what?\u2019 \u2013 I hope,\u201d she said, anticipating a nationwide shift in attitudes. Texas, though, in common with other conservative-led states, has focused on loosening firearms restrictions in recent years. Proponents of campus carry laws argue that they give a small minority of students who are responsible, trained, gun owners the chance to enhance their personal protection and exercise their second amendment rights, and that there have not been significant problems in states that already have them. Against the wishes of some police chiefs, Texas\u2019s governor, Greg Abbott, signed the bill into law in June last year. He also visited a gun store, flanked by National Rifle Association lobbyists, to rubber-stamp a law allowing the licensed open carrying of handguns in most public places. That went into effect in January. Last week, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, sued the city of Austin in a bid to force it to allow guns inside the city hall. \u201cThis was about money, it\u2019s not about anything else, it\u2019s about the NRA\u2019s money and ability to control every lawmaker \u2013 or attempt to,\u201d James said. \u201cI think rank and file officers wonder how it\u2019s going to work and how it\u2019s going to be implemented and how it\u2019s going to impact campus life,\u201d said Charley Wilkison, executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which has not taken a formal stance on the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re all watching to see how it\u2019s implemented, how this plays out.\u201d Concerns on campus Critics contend that more guns make life more dangerous, not less, with the potential for accidents, for arguments to suddenly turn lethal, and for an increase in suicides. They also believe that there is a risk of confusion if multiple people are armed in active shooter situations, and a likelihood of false alarms. Three University of Texas professors last month brought an ongoing lawsuit arguing that they should not be forced to allow guns in classrooms because it would create a chilling effect on their free speech rights since they would be afraid to discuss controversial topics lest an armed student take offense. \u201cI could see that being a hindrance; I mean, definitely just knowing they\u2019re on campus will make it a little different,\u201d said Erin Shadwick, a 26-year-old education student, standing near the new granite monument that bears the 17 names of Whitman\u2019s victims. More than 30 others were injured. The campus was quiet on Monday as Austinites reflected on the anniversary and digested the news of a fatal shooting early on Sunday in downtown\u2019s bustling entertainment district, less than two miles from the campus. Protests including student walkouts are planned for 24 August, the first day of classes. Since the law demands that weapons be hidden, it was impossible to tell if anyone was strolling the tree-lined squares and alleys with a Glock or a Smith &amp; Wesson. \u201cBeing concealed you don\u2019t know who has a gun, who doesn\u2019t, and that in itself is kind of freaky to me,\u201d Shadwick said. Fenves, the president, said the university will assess whether campus carry is having an impact on recruitment of staff and students. \u201cThe reality is that people are definitely seeking other places to work,\u201d said Ellen Spiro, a film professor and member of the Gun Free UT group. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of debating going on within university and faculty about what they can and cannot say regarding guns in classrooms and to me it\u2019s just a shame that we\u2019re even having these discussions. It\u2019s just wrong to have guns be allowed in a classroom where you can\u2019t have your cellphone or eat a hamburger,\u201d she said. Spiro applied for fellowships as a result of the law and is headed to a project in Chile. Whatever numbers may ultimately show about the law\u2019s impact on safety and recruitment, she added, \u201cthe not-so-concrete part is the normalization of guns, and that\u2019s not OK because that\u2019s what\u2019s killing people in this country. We have a huge problem with guns and they\u2019re adding to it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
