Four nations produce half of all carbon emissions but the US has gone into reverse in tackling the climate emergency under Donald Trump while Russia has failed to make any commitment at all. Other major oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have set no targets to reduce emissions. China and India are cleaning up their energy systems but their surging economies mean emissions will continue to grow for a decade. Under the 2015 Paris deal, countries agreed to limit global heating to 2C, or 1.5C if possible. Each country makes a voluntary pledge of climate action, but to date these would result in global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in 2018 that emissions, which are still rising, must fall by 50% by 2030 to be on track for 1.5C. Only the 28 countries of the European Union and a few others including Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine are on track. Of the 184 national Paris pledges made, 136 are judged insufficient in the report, published by the Universal Ecological Fund. Another problem is many pledges are unlikely to be met, due to the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, reversing environmental policies, or because poorer nations do not get the funding they need \u2013 the US and Australia have stopped making such contributions. \u201cThe current pledges made under the Paris agreement are totally inadequate to put us on a pathway to meet either the 1.5C or the 2C goal,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Prof Sir Robert Watson, a former IPCC chair and scientific adviser to the UK and US governments. \u201cWith just 1C warming so far, we are already seeing some very significant effects. The effects at 3-4C will be very profound on people around the world.\u201d \u201cWhen you see a country like Russia not even putting a pledge on the table, it is extremely disturbing,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia and Russia rely heavily on their fossil fuels but that is no excuse. Those that have not effectively made any pledges yet really should be shamed into being part of the solution.\u201d Harvard University\u2019s James McCarthy, a co-author of the report, said: \u201cFailing to reduce emissions drastically and rapidly will result in an environmental and economic disaster from human-induced climate change.\u201d Failing to halve emissions by 2030 means the number of hurricanes, severe storms, wildfires and droughts are likely double in number and intensity, the scientists said, costing $2bn (\u00a31,55bn) a day within a decade. To avoid this, the scale of climate change action must double or triple, they said. The Paris agreement does allow for nations to ratchet up their commitments. \u201cThis report demonstrates we need to ratchet badly, and as quickly as possible,\u201d said Watson. China and India should be applauded for improving their energy systems, he said, but their emissions must peak. However, Watson said it was difficult to expect leadership from these nations when those with the biggest historical emissions, like the US, were not doing so. The report concluded that countries that had pledged between 20-40% emission reductions by 2030 needed to do much better, including Australia, Canada and Japan. \u201cLeaders need to adopt new policies to close coal-fired power plants and promote renewable and carbon-free power sources such as wind, solar and hydropower,\u201d said McCarthy. That means closing 2,400 coal-fired power stations around the world in the next decade and tackling the 250 new coal-powered units that are under construction. Improved energy efficiency is also critical, said co-author Prof Nebojsa Nakicenovic, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, potentially saving households around the world $500bn a year in energy bills. From cars to homes to industry, he said, the potential of energy efficiency was so great that if implemented no extra energy would be required in 2030, despite the fact that global population was expected to be 1.2bn higher than today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
