With over a dozen antique shops in the town, and a couple with proprietors claiming a particular expertise, I had an extended learning opportunity available to me before I bought one. The surviving artifacts of a country craft that flourished from the 16th century to the early 19th century have interested me for some years and I was very pleased when an 1830 clock, made by Rogers of Romsey, was offered to me at a price which did not involve exhausting the money box. The trade is having a hard time at present I was advised. If the retail sector is depressed, then I guess the antique market is the first to suffer. This clock is, perhaps, the Ford Fiesta of its horological period. It has none of the bells and whistles that I have both seen and heard on more elaborate examples from about 1750 onwards, including clocks by Tetbury makers, especially Coates, and has a 30-hour movement which involves a daily adjustment of the long weight which hangs in front of the pendulum. It also has a plangent striking note which involves turning it off overnight in the interest of unbroken sleep. But the slow, sonorous tick, enhanced by the long closed case, is a positively calming influence. It is also steadily and remarkably accurate. The painted face reflects the rumoured historic provenance - it has sea anchors on all four corners and was made, allegedly, for one of Nelson's post captains who supported him in the fleet at Trafalgar. Rather fitting in this bicentenary year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
