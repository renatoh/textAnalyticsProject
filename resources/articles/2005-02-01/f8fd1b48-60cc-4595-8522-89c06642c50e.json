Fluent now round these Unchevronned long deceptive bends. Bare back seat, no chair, No song or 'Are we nearly there.' Clearer view now Of the road behind. Severn glints alluringly - Keep driving - Like a week ago. Last time I saw you. In this foreign land Resolve steps up a gear. We'll learn to do things different here. Crops combined and planned On land long understood. Snug established homes, Cosy rosy anchored And preserved. In a passing lane A mother holds Her daughter's hand. Destination southern city. Signposts blur then clarify Then blur again. Signalling potential for direction, Indicating need to get in lane. Nearly there, yet Barely passed a junction on The long road back to you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
