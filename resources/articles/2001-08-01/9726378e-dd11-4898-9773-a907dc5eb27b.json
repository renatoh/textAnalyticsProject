Only Zayde's now-dead mother, Judith, was cunning enough to outwit him. She chooses the name Zayde (meaning grandfather in Yiddish) to confuse the Angel of Death, and lets three men all think they are the boy's father. Shalev's novel, plump with incident and character, is structured around the four meals that Jacob, a candidate father, prepares for Zayde, but in between Shalev brings on side dishes of interlocking stories that keep the reader sated, if not a little overfed. The Parrot's Theorem Denis Guedj (Phoenix, \u00a36.99) However sweet the plot in which Guedj coats his novel, nothing can disguise the fact that at its centre lies mathematics. \"Ouch\", say the innumerate, feeling their brains freeze over when bookshop owner Mr Ruche takes his lodgers, twins Jonathan and Lea plus Max, down to the Louvre to demonstrate how to measure the height of a pyramid (and that's an easy one). Guedj, who teaches the history of science, uses Sidney the parrot and a mystery involving an eccentric mathematician to jazz up his history of maths. Despite curious facts (did you know that Arab numerals came from India?), its intended young audience will smell the didactic intent. The Wars Timothy Findley (Faber, \u00a36.99) Robert Ross is an everyman, the sort of decent character - nearer boy than man - who wades through the mud and horror of the first world war. Though now its carefully orchestrated portrayal of one man's descent towards hell and a futile attempt to assert his humanity seems unremarkable, when The Wars was published in Canada in 1977 Findley was a pioneer of this kind of historical fiction. As well as trenches, gas and friendship, the narrative deals with memory and record when an anonymous narrator combs archives, stares at photographs and interviews survivors in an attempt to put flesh back on to a name and a sparse military record. Days of the Bees Thomas Sanchez (Flamingo, \u00a36.99) There are muses that appeal to the mind and those that simply excite the senses. The relationship between a painter, Francisco Zermano, and Louise, the woman he paints, is initially about flesh only, and pneumatic Louise seems stuck forever as a mere object of Zermano's eye. But as an American academic finds the letters they write when the second world war sends Zermano back to Paris, and strands Louise in a small village, Sanchez makes Louise, who joins the Resistance, the focus of the story. But this inversion, and the story's unexpected closure, are not enough to paper over some deeply purple passages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
