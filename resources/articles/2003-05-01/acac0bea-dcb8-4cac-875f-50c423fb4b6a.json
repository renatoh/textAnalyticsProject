He will start by offering an extended contract to Dave Jones, whose deal as manager has a year to run. Details of Jones's reward for taking Wolves to a level at which they last competed 19 years ago will be discussed at a board meeting. Asked if he would give Jones a longer contract, Hayward, who turns 80 next month, replied: \"Of course. Obviously.\" Hayward's own future had been in doubt before Monday's play-off final but he rejected suggestions he might walk away having finally delivered top-flight football. \"I can't leave the club,\" he said. \"I'm tied. I was born 300 yards away from Molineux. How can I leave, except in a coffin?\" Jones's position at Molineux seemed under threat at the turn of the year, when Hayward made clear promotion was essential and warned that the manager was living \"month by month and day by day\". But Jones's job is now secure and he has started preparing for the Premiership by asking Paul Ince to stay beyond this summer, when the 35-year-old becomes a free agent. Ince is considering whether he is capable of playing another season. Jones said immediately after the 3-0 win over Sheffield United that he hoped to make signings. And Hayward, who has pumped an estimated \u00a360m into Wolves, suggested that transfer funds could be taken as read. \"He's been given the requisite assistance for the last 2 years,\" said the owner. \"Don't forget the board have also done a good job.\" Hayward seems likely to follow Birmingham City, who spent heavily and stayed up while making a profit, rather than West Bromwich, who operated on a tight budget and suffered immediate relegation. His wealth helps, of course. \"We have still not to go overboard on wages and do the same as Bradford, Barnsley, Derby and Ipswich,\" he said. \"Also, we have so many good youngsters.\" Hayward praised Jones most of all, noting how the former Southampton manager helped save the club from relegation when he took over in January 2001 and then overcame the \"humiliation\" of last season's collapse to win promotion. \"I think he's terrific,\" Hayward said. \"He inspires the team and gets the best out of them. Apart from one or two players who we can't always bank on, he's chosen fantastically. Denis Irwin and Paul Ince have made such a tremendous difference. The youngsters - Lee Naylor, Matt Murray, Joleon [Lescott] - have come through wonderfully. It's a nice blend of youngsters and experienced players.\" Hayward suffered a sleepless night before the final. He hinted that he believed he had helped spark promotion with remarks he made at the turn of the year, when Jones was told \"in no uncertain terms what was expected of him\". Neil Warnock has suggested he will retire from management if he fails to take United into the Premiership next season. But Warnock, 54, faces the break-up of his squad. The prized midfielder Michael Brown will go if any club meets the \u00a34m valuation. Stuart McCall may retire unless Warnock persuades the 38-year-old otherwise, and Dean Windass is unlikely to sign a new one-year deal .John Curtis and Mark Rankine return to Blackburn and Preston respectively after loans. A former minder of Cardiff's owner Sam Hammam was yesterday charged in connection with a hotel fire alarm which awoke QPR players at 3am on Sunday, 12 hours before their play-off against Cardiff. Neil MacNamara, 39, has been charged by Gwent Police with criminal damage and making a false and malicious fire call. He was bailed to appear before Newport magistrates on June 5."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
