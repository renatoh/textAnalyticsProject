With three of Sven-Goran Eriksson's starting XI at White Hart Lane - one youth-team product in Ledley King and two players I brought to the club, Jermain Defoe and Paul Robinson - they had reason to feel proud, particularly given the performance of the players involved. The last time I saw Jermain was in the dentist at the end of last season. I'd just left Spurs, and he was waiting to find out if he would make the final England squad for Euro 2004. He was typical Defoe that day, very simple, focused and straightforward. He was always a pleasure to deal with but I've got to say that no one lost out when he wasn't allowed to give interviews the other night: he always says the same things anyway. It was never a risk bringing him to Spurs. He's such an excellent finisher and his scoring record, back to his time in Charlton's youth set-up, is fantastic. He's got a low centre of gravity and has a small backlift, which means he can get a shot off before a defender's got time to block it. His right foot is his main weapon - I reckon nine out of 10 goals will come from it - and it is truly ferocious. Already this season he's scored some eye-catching goals. The one against Birmingham stands out, given that he picked the ball up almost in the centre circle, but that isn't typical. In training he never really stood out until the ball got near goal, and his link-up play will improve over the next few years, but he's single-minded and has that Malcolm Macdonald philosophy, he's not afraid to miss. My one worry when Spurs signed him was who he'd end up playing with. He knew Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 from West Ham, so he could play with a taller man, but I wasn't sure how he'd work with Robbie Keane, who superficially is very similar. Despite that I've got no doubt they will form Jacques Santini's preferred partnership at Spurs. That experience of playing with a smaller man will make Defoe more useful for England, where he will end up playing with Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney. King is a very similar character. Both are quiet, docile people who say very little. And both are blossoming into very exciting players. King's experience in midfield must stand him in good stead. Playing in defence for England you don't need to be so strong in the air, as international sides don't hit the high ball so often. All he's got to do is read the play, anticipate it and pass the ball effectively with either foot, which is what he does best. Spurs needed his athleticism in the middle last season, his pace, running and ability to break up attacks, and his reading of the game improved as a result. Of the three Spurs players who started on Wednesday he's the only one who didn't make his name somewhere else. But his success is no surprise for Spurs people, who all knew about him very early. \"The game came easy to him\" - I think that was the phrase his coaches used. Like Rooney and other really bright youngsters, those who carry the burden of potential greatness, King almost missed reserve football entirely but doesn't appear to have suffered for it. I wasn't surprised when he was called up. When Sven came to Tottenham we'd always talk about the players with potential, and his name cropped up quite a lot. I always felt Robinson was an England goalkeeper in waiting. We paid \u00a31.5m for him; in a way it was an unfair price for Leeds but it was a fire sale. I spent a lot of time persuading him it was a good move, and was very impressed by his character. He's a straightforward Yorkshire boy, who carries no airs and graces and uses blunt language, even to the chairman. He has to watch his weight, as people have noticed, but he's a strong-bodied goalkeeper. He reminds me of Peter Shilton; he's got strong round shoulders like a tiger. He prowls. He's also very vocal for a young keeper, perhaps too excited. He'll become calmer in time, and has all the physical attributes to maintain a very high level. Tottenham have always had a presence in the England dressing room, even if they haven't had an all-conquering side for some time. It's a long-held view in the midlands and up north that players there might not get the same recognition as those who play for the big London clubs, and I think there might be some truth in that. But I think whoever you support you could hardly deny that Tottenham have now got some young players with real class."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
