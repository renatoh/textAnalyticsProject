Liverpool, inspired by the excellent Virgil van Dijk, weathered the second-half revival Palace had mustered until being reduced to 10 men and secured a second successive clean sheet to prevail despite offering only glimpses of their attacking best. \u201cYou have to play it as it is and be a real challenger, play ugly, do all that type of stuff,\u201d said Klopp of his team\u2019s display. \u201cOur target is to be a difficult opponent. We did that. \u201cWe expected Palace to be strong, and to have that clear approach against us playing a big number of long balls. I saw that in the warm-up from [Wayne] Hennessey practising and thought, wow, this is going to be really difficult. But to see a defender winning almost 100% of the situations clearly without a foul ... Virgil was very important. His performance was really, really good. Quality costs a specific price. Cars are like that. Lots of things are like that. Players too. But nobody thinks about the fee now, which is good. In this market at the moment, he\u2019s at least worth it even if it\u2019s not too cheap. \u201cWe could have done better offensively, and it was not a brilliant football game from us. We don\u2019t have to make it something it was not. But it was a big step. Everyone knows that when we are not brilliant, we usually lose. Today we weren\u2019t brilliant but we won.\u201d Palace\u2019s stubborn refusal to go quietly after the interval, even after Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s dismissal for a professional foul, offered Hodgson some encouragement. Yet the former Liverpool and England manager was still incensed long after the final whistle by the soft penalty awarded to the visitors for Mamadou Sakho\u2019s challenge on Mohamed Salah near the end of the first half. \u201cIt\u2019s not a penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in football a long time and, if that\u2019s a penalty, then the game has changed beyond all recognition. There\u2019s no way [Sakho] is looking to foul the player. He\u2019s trying to defend. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s looking to get contact on the player himself. If people can\u2019t see that, then I will be the pariah who only sees what he wants to see. If all you guys up there see something different, then I will accept that. \u201cI do not want penalties for my team in that way. I don\u2019t think we gave away a penalty, and I don\u2019t think Liverpool deserved to be leading 1-0 at half-time thanks to that penalty. And, at the end of the game, Van Dijk clears out Max Meyer and we didn\u2019t get a penalty. We were unlucky with referee decisions. It\u2019s a cause for frustration and anger. But if you ask me about the team\u2019s performance, I thought it was very, very good. I\u2019m more interested in the fact we played really well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
