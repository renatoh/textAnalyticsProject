Uppal's Orchid , Radisson , and Lemon Tree Hotels . Booking the pickup through the hotel is strongly advised for foreigners and women - if you don't have a car ready, you'll be surrounded by touts in a minute. If for some reason your car doesn't show up, I'd strongly recommend hiring a radio cab (you need to call 1929 from an Indian mobile or landline) rather than taking a prepaid yellow and black cab - there have been some nasty incidents with female travelers in the last few months.
