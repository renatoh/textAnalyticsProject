Anthony Burgin, who has not worked since the head-on collision which saw Hamed jailed and stripped of his MBE last year, was interviewed by South Yorkshire police and released on bail. Mr Burgin, 40, has been left facing lifelong pain following the accident in May 2005, in which his wife Claire also suffered serious injuries. Hamed was trying to impress a business associate with his new \u00a3320,000 carbon-fibre Mercedes McLaren when he hit the Burgins' VW Golf at 90mph while overtaking on a blind corner. Mr Burgin's solicitor, Jane Wright of the Sheffield firm Irwin Mitchell, which has been handling a compensation claim against Hamed, confirmed the police move. She said: \"Anthony Burgin denies any wrongdoing and is happy to help the police with their inquiries. He was interviewed following complaints made against him by the Hamed family.\" The tragedy tarnished the 32-year-old boxer's name and effectively ended his career, when it emerged that he had left the scene of the accident soon afterwards, allegedly because of the mood of other drivers who had stopped to help. Irwin Mitchell could not give any further details about the complaint made by the Hamed family."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
