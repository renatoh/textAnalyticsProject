Pogba scored the 18th-minute opener before Henrikh Mkhitaryan doubled the lead for a 2-0 win over the Dutch side in Stockholm. It came two days after the terrorist attack that killed 22 people, some children, and injured scores more. Mourinho said: \u201cYou know, it was really hard, that is why we didn\u2019t want to have the press conference [before the final] because we had to prepare ourselves to do our job and to try to organise events that are much more important than our job. But the world goes on and does not stop and we have to do our work. \u201cI agree with Uefa\u2019s decision to play the match now. It obviously takes happiness from our achievement. If we could we would change peoples lives for this cup \u2013 we would not think twice. Does this cup make the city of Manchester a bit happier? Maybe. But we came to do our job and we can\u2019t avoid the happiness because when you win you go away happy and proud. The boys were fantastic. They put on a block and stayed away from everything and concentrated on a football match, which we did very well.\u201d Pogba, their world-record \u00a389m summer signing, said: \u201cWe know things like this are very sad, all over the world. We had to focus, it was very important. We won for Manchester, we worked for them, for the country. We play for England, for Manchester and for the people who died.\u201d Ander Herrera, voted the man of the match, said the club had been suffering on Tuesday, but echoed Pogba\u2019s sentiments. \u201cYesterday morning we were devastated,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cWe were really sad because you think of life and football \u2013 you have no choice. It was difficult to train but the manager told us the only thing we could do is win this for them and that is what we have done. It is just a football game and a trophy but if we can help and support with this just 1% it is enough for us.\u201d Afterwards the victorious team and Mourinho posed by a large banner that read \u201cManchester \u2013 A City United\u201d. The victory means United have won every European club competition and will compete in next season\u2019s Champions League competition. Mourinho has also won the club two major trophies in his first season after lifting the EFL Cup in February. He also aimed a barb at those managers he described as \u201cpoets\u201d who do not win anything. \u201cThere are lots of poets in football, the poets don\u2019t win many titles, we knew where they were better than us, and us better than them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the end of a difficult season but a very good season, we prefer this way than finish fourth. We win a title, an important title, that closes the lot \u2013 we have now won every [European] title in world football.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s tally is two Champions League and two Europa Leagues, having also won the latter when it was the Uefa Cup. He said: \u201cI am very humble when I play finals. I make my final respect the strength of the opponent and understand their weakness so if I say something about my finals, something about my team is they are always humble. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to see any football, or any international friendlies. It was hard to organise this last couple of months, very hard, short on numbers, trying to rest players, trying not to have very bad results. The kids were amazing, [they] managed to finish with some dignity. Three trophies in season [he includes the Community Shield]. I am really happy with players after my most difficult season as a manager.\u201d The manager indicated Wayne Rooney, a late substitute, could stay. \u201cHe can be here next season and he is an important player. If he stays I am happy,\u201d the manager said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
