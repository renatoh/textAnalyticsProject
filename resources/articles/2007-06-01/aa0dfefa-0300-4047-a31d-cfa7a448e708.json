I mean, if the proletariat ever does rise up and overthrow the ruling classes, I should like to think I could lend a hand, but I fear all that stringing up of people from lampposts may well be beyond me, with the state of my knees. Still, every year round about Royal Ascot time, I feel a little of the old fervour return. It is the royal procession that does it for me. Not just the Royal Family - although I could do without the regulation sycophantic cooing over every wretched outfit Her Majesty puts on - but some of the retinue in the following carriages. \"In the third carriage,\" announced Clare Balding, enumerating the runners and riders in the Queen's party with customary brisk efficiency on day two of the meeting, \"is the fifth Baron Aberdare, and the Honourable Gerald Maitland Carew, known as 'Bunny'.\" How many names does the chap want, for goodness sake? He already has Honourable, Gerald, Maitland, and Carew, and now he has bagged Bunny as well. Typical aristocrat, hogging all the names when there are decent working class Geordies like Sting having to make do with just one. I like to think of myself as the compassionate type, but if I were running the revolution, any full-grown adult male, going round calling himself \"Bunny\" outside the confines of a PG Wodehouse novel, would definitely have a lamppost waiting for him. Clare shared carriage duties with an extremely posh, very camp man called James Sherwood, who sounded like the bastard love child of Dale Winton and Brian Sewell, and knew more about hats than could possibly be healthy. \"The Duchess of Cornwall's hat is reminiscent of the Romanov Grand Duchesses,\" was the kind of statement he came out with, and apparently meant. \"Princess Michael of Kent is the Joan Crawford of the Windsors,\" he oozed. \"The glamour is always utterly beyond...\", at which point he seemed to lose it altogether, and possibly called for Rishi Persad to fan him down. \"If you wanted to celebrate a day of Britishness you couldn't pick a better one than Royal Ascot,\" maintained Sherwood, and certainly an aspect of Britishness was being celebrated, the one we are said to do \"really well in this country\". Mind you, give me a couple of million pounds and I reckon I could put on a pretty good parade myself. Mine would include dancing girls, Acker Bilk and his Paramount Jazz Band (if Acker is still alive), and those slightly sinister big heads you see people wearing in the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans. Oh, and possibly some of those bicycling bears thrown out of work when circuses stopped using animals. It would be like a scene from a Fellini movie, and much more fun than the one processing down the straight mile at Ascot every day. I sometimes wonder whether all the good Helen Mirren did for the Queen in that film is not undone by this ritual, which seems to me like a recruiting poster for republicanism. I do not wish to be too harsh on Her Majesty's guests, some of whom had distinguished military records and probably died in the war for people like me, but you do wonder where all these titles Clare kept mentioning came from. One fellow was described as the \"Keeper of the Matchbook\", which I gather is something to do with the racing industry but sounded like he might be the chap who used to hang around to light the late Princess Margaret's fags, whom nobody had thought to take off the payroll. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall shared their carriage with the \"Master of the Horse\", Lord Vestey, and Lady Vestey. As well as being Master of the Horse, Lord Vestey, said Clare, \"was chairman of the Meat Training Council.\" Has no one in the Royal set ever heard of conflicts of interest? The Vestey family, Clare added, \"actually pioneered the transportation of refrigerated meat,\" which was interesting, as a few minutes earlier Clare and Willie Carson had been answering an email query about how horses are transported 12,000 miles from Australia to race. Apparently, the animals stand all the way, without even a dodgy Adam Sandler movie to watch, which sounds a little brutal to me; and were the Guardian's lawyers not watching me closely, would have me wondering if those Vesties had not had a hand in this process. Good news, by the way, m'learned friends. I am not going to mention the Vestey family's financial history, because I can never remember the difference between avoidance and evasion. \"They look like they're chatting away, really enjoying themselves in the second carriage, which I am sure they are,\" reported Clare, \"They will all have had lunch at Windsor Castle before making their way here to the racecourse.\" I cannot tell you how pleased I was. Forgive me for being a little sour, but we need a corrective to the guff Sherwood was spouting. \"Another dramatic brim from the Duchess of Cornwall,\" he enthused over one of Camilla's hats. Call me old-fashioned, but I do not see why someone with access to limitless wealth and every milliner in Mayfair, is praised for putting a damned hat on. I tell you, anyone who thinks the BBC is a hotbed of dangerous lefties should try watching Royal Ascot for a day or two. martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
