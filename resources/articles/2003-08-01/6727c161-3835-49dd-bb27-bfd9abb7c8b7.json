At seven months pregnant in 35 degrees, one cannot exactly pass unnoticed. It's hot enough for anyone, but when you are carrying an extra two stone (OK, OK, fine, say three) you didn't have a few months ago, it is particularly warm. And that's not even counting the chafing thighs, swollen ankles, puffy fingers, unwieldy breasts - and the fact that you are wearing embarrassing 'cover-the-bump' pants that could actually be pulled right up your chest and over your head. Sleeping at night - or, rather, not sleeping at night - has been excellent practice for the imminent arrival, or so I am told (this is my first). Again, it's been hot for anyone - but particularly distressing when you wake up after snatching 20 minutes' sleep to realise you have swollen to the size of a whale (once asleep I often forget I am pregnant, so seeing my belly hove into view on waking is always something of a shock). Then I drop off again to wake up with excruciating leg cramp five minutes later, accompanied by labour-esque screams. On that particularly hot and feverish night in the middle of last week I sat upright from a terrifying dream that something was invading my lungs and ribs, kicking and punching them from the inside, Alien -style. Except it wasn't a dream. The funny thing is, I could not care less. In fact, I have been loving it. And so has the baby (I hope - it is rather difficult to tell). It seems to sleep in the outside heat, and happily kicks away all night when it's cooler. The experience has not been anything like as bad as I expected (my mother carried my sister during 1976, the last summer of this kind, and had issued dire warnings, in particular about the discomfort of the pants). And there has been one unexpected plus: I have developed what I like to think of as a Farrah Fawcett-style tan (alright, three plumpish Charlie's Angels melded into one person). In pregnancy your skin can produce more melanin (skin pigment), which means you tan faster. So I only have to sit outside for five minutes and my freckles come out. This glamorous effect comes as something of a shock. Usually dismissed by the rest of the world as pregnant-and-therefore-hypochondriac/neurotic/weepy/dangerous (you can see the fear in people's eyes when they tentatively ask, 'So how are you coping in this weather?' and expecting you to burst into tears and/or assault them), I am relieved to have something to be cheerful about. It is pleasant to be able to present a blooming front to the world and confound people's expectations that you are a wilting, sickly mess. To maintain this fa\u00e7ade I have discovered the small, simple comforts in life: baby oil kept in the fridge (for stretchmarks), special 'mommy-to-be' anti-Michelin-man leg-depuffing gels and ice cubes as a foodstuff. The best thing is that I have been curiously buoyed up by the kindness of strangers. From the looks on their faces, they definitely think things must be much worse for me than they really are: no one envies a pregnant woman at these temperatures. At first this irritated me enormously. I can manage perfectly well without interference and pity, especially as most people just stare (and stare...and stare) at the vastness of the bump. The heat has given complete strangers licence to call out 'are you sure there's just the one in there?' and, of course, 'bet you're hot'. Hundreds, if not thousands, simply smirk when they see The Fecund Weeble, waddling down the street in a customised M&amp;S outsized nightie (the only thing cool enough to wear), pretending she is not that hot and not really moving that slowly at all. But then I realised there was something rather lovely about it all. Suddenly, in a few days London had become a friendly country hamlet. On the hottest day on recent record, barely out of my front door, three unknown people stopped and dotingly asked me when I was due. On the high street, two women stopped to tell me with some urgency of their own scorching summer pregnancies. Then a hooded youth who had been discreetly urinating against a wall further up the road glanced guiltily at my stomach as he passed by and apologised for his misdemeanour. On the train platform, a scary-looking skater boy extinguished his spliff, solicitously moved his skate board and ushered me to sit down, asking me how I was feeling (this never happens). I counted a total of 10 people who addressed me on the way into work (and only two asked if I was having twins). Most of them felt compelled to speak, as seeing me had made them realise how ridiculous they were for complaining and griping about the heat. One look at my bloated, sweating, maternal form and they would just burst out laughing - at themselves and their grumpiness. I was pleased to be of some social use. And for the first time in a decade of living in the city I truly felt at home. People were looking at me, talking to me, for no reason other than sociability. In four days I have had more smiles and eye contact with strangers than in the past 10 years. The searing sun has bonded us all in adversity. Big pant wearers and regular-sized heat sufferers alike, we are united in our crusade to grin and bear it - to damn well enjoy it, if at all possible. If I were feeling hormonal (and, believe me, I am) I might go as far as to say that there was even something of the British wartime spirit about it. If it takes the growth of my belly to reveal mankind's humanity, I am happy to sacrifice. Now hand over those ice creams. \u00b7 Cristina Odone is away, having given birth to Isabelle on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
