We're not even close.\" The success of the first two Spider-Man films showed Sony was now regarded as a provider of entertainment as well as consumer electronics. Sony is expected to register operating profit above \u00a5400bn (\u00a31.7bn) in the current business year. Sales are expected to have risen 6% to \u00a58.7 trillion thanks to sales of PlayStation 3 and LCD TVs in the US and Europe.
