Commuters gathered outside Victoria station in Manchester to draw attention to the regular delays, cancellations and overcrowding on services run by Northern, calling upcoming new year price increases an insult to passengers who already pay over the odds for a \u201cvery poor\u201d service. The protesters, members of the Facebook group Northern Resist, demanded fares be reduced by at least a third \u201cuntil Northern rail achieves a punctuality target of 70% of trains on time and no more than 30% of services are \u2018short-formed\u2019 [those operating with fewer carriages than necessary]\u201d. Figures from the Office of Rail and Road show that only 56% of Northern services were on time in the last quarter. Some protesters claim their journeys have been delayed every day since before the summer. \u201cAccording to Northern\u2019s own data, I haven\u2019t got home once on time since May,\u201d said Becca Hans, a project manager from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire, who commutes to Manchester. \u201cIt really does ruin your life. It might sound like a massive overstatement, but if you never know if you are going to get to work on time or when you will be home, it\u2019s a constant downer.\u201d Carrying a sign reading \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of a decent railway\u201d, Christine Roberts joked that she now received more money in refunds from Northern than from her salary. \u201cI can claim back \u00a31.42 for every 15-minute delay and in November they paid me back \u00a360, with another \u00a340 outstanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThe franchise should be given to a company who knows how to run a railway. Northern couldn\u2019t run a bath.\u201d Rowena Marsh, a nurse, said she had recently \u201cgiven in\u201d and bought a car after enduring years of delays from St Helens to Manchester. \u201cI do prefer to use public transport because of my environmental ideals, but I had to buy a car in August. I just couldn\u2019t take it any more.\u201d Julie Parkinson, who commutes from Wigan to various universities in the north-west, said fewer than half of her trains were on time. She also objected to the \u201cabsolutely filthy\u201d seats and toilets, which still empty out on to the tracks on some of the older Pacer services, which are being phased out. \u201cNo wonder there are tomatoes growing between the rails,\u201d she said. She said the government should start investing more in rail services in the north of England: \u201cWe are so considerably underfunded compared with London and the south-east.\u201d Government transport spending per person in London is two and a half times more than it is in the north of England, according to analysis from the centre-left thinktank IPPR North. Treasury data shows that in 2018-19, \u00a3903 was spent in the capital for every resident, while in the north the sum was \u00a3376. Passengers pay over the odds for a poor service while shareholders receive \u201cbillions\u201d, complained Parkinson. At the weekend rail unions claimed that shareholders in private rail companies received \u00a31.2bn in dividends over the past five years. Analysis by the TUC also showed that while fares had risen by 46% over the last decade, the average weekly wage had only gone up by 23%. On 2 January fares will increase by 2.7%, which the protest organiser, Kate Anstee, said \u201cadded insult to injury\u201d and hit commuters at a time they were at their poorest. She echoed a call by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who has repeatedly demanded that Northern, owned by the German state railway company Deutsche Bahn, be stripped of its franchise. A spokesman for Northern said: \u201cIt\u2019s on record that the Northern franchise has faced several material and unprecedented challenges in the past couple of years, outside the direct control of Northern. The most significant of these is the ongoing, late delivery of major infrastructure upgrades. The North West electrification was more than two years late. \u201cWe are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation, with 33 of our 101 new trains now in service and driver training taking place on dozens more trains right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
