Not that of Granit Xhaka, whose situation appears too far gone at this point, but it would at least have been a good-news story if Shkodran Mustafi\u2019s late header had settled a game that was verging on the unwatchable. Mustafi has had his own struggles with the Arsenal home crowd but by full\u2011time the overriding taste was, once again, of the team\u2019s broader problems. They were exposed in the first minute of stoppage time when Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, who should have been ahead at the break but slowed up as torrential rain dogged the second half, had one last try at salvaging their first point in Group F. When Marcus Edwards\u2019s cross from the right was kept alive at the far post, Arsenal had no one on hand to clear and Bruno Duarte\u2019s acrobatic finish ensured they lost a lead for the fourth consecutive game. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed we didn\u2019t win, but the point continued our way to first in the group,\u201d Unai Emery said. Arsenal will reach the knockout stage if Standard Liege lose against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday and, even bearing in mind their mind-boggling capacity for self-immolation, it is unthinkable that they will not be playing European football in the new year. From that perspective, they did the required job against enterprising opponents who had run them tantalisingly close at home a fortnight ago; the problem is that, for the most part, this was a dire performance that threw up most of the concerns that have dominated their past few weeks. Take the fact that Mustafi\u2019s header, firmly planted across the Vit\u00f3ria goalkeeper, Douglas, when Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s free-kick found him unmarked, was their first on-target effort. Vit\u00f3ria ended up outshooting Arsenal by 15 to seven \u2013 an eventual improvement on the half-time tally of 10-1 \u2013 and the visitors did not create a single noteworthy chance from open play. \u201cThey are a very defensive team, with a big structure defensively, and it is not easy because they were defending very deep and also together,\u201d Emery explained in mitigation. \u201cTo create small spaces was not easy against that team.\u201d Vitoria were certainly well organised but they still found time to cause Arsenal numerous problems in the first 50 minutes. An evident taste for shots from range brought a rocket that their own P\u00eap\u00ea, an impressive midfielder, crashed against Emiliano Mart\u00ednez\u2019s right post from 25 yards and a drive from Edwards that the Argentinian repelled at full stretch. Edmond Tapsoba should have done better with a free header, Mart\u00ednez saving superbly again, and Edwards hesitated at the crucial moment when running clear shortly after the interval. Their manager, Ivo Vieira, said his team had \u201cmore goal chances and more attacking volume\u201d than Arsenal, which was entirely true. So if Vit\u00f3ria are defensive, what exactly are Arsenal? Emery fielded a three-man backline for the first time this season but they rarely looked tight until the 20 minutes before Mustafi\u2019s goal, when proceedings might as well have ground to a halt in the downpour. Meanwhile, a front line of P\u00e9p\u00e9, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka barely had a sniff and while Dani Ceballos provided a few watchable moments in deeper areas he departed early with what appeared to be an ankle injury and later limped away from the stadium. Cohesion was lacking all over the pitch and there needs to be a quick remedy before the visit on Saturday to a supremely drilled Leicester, where 90 minutes this sluggish will result in serious punishment. Vit\u00f3ria could have inflicted an even more brutal blow, twice coming within inches of following Duarte\u2019s strike with a winner. Mustafi almost blotted his copybook with an own goal and the substitute Rochinha shot a whisker wide with virtually the last action. Arsenal, for whom Rob Holding took the armband and could have converted a first-half header, could at least console themselves that there were lower depths to plumb. The late drama meant Xhaka\u2019s loss of the captaincy, dealt with comprehensively by Emery the previous evening, took a back seat. Local media did their best to revive another story from the week\u2019s cycle, asking Emery whether talk that Arsenal were courting Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 the reverse is far likelier to be true \u2013 surprised him. \u201cI am the coach,\u201d was his response to that, and it was almost as useful an offering as anyone in Arsenal\u2019s ranks had produced all afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
