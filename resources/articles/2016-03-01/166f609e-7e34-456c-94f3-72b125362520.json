Diego Costa departed to the taunts of Evertonians and with a warning from Guus Hiddink to curb his antics. The contrast between Chelsea strikers past and present was stark. One was unstoppable, the other uncontrollable. Lukaku brought back memories of Didier Drogba, a former team-mate of both, at his best, while Costa was reminiscent of the Ivorian at his self-destructive worst. Costa had been on his best behaviour since Hiddink\u2019s arrival in December. \u201cIn principle, I protect every man but it\u2019s not good to do something stupid,\u201d the Dutchman said. Idiocy may have been the lenient interpretation. Many of Costa\u2019s underhand, unpleasant and unnecessary antics have gone unnoticed by officials but two blatant barges on Gareth Barry resulted in a first dismissal in England. Barry denied Costa bit him, which, as Luis Su\u00e1rez incurred a 10-game suspension for such an offence, would surely have brought his season to premature conclusion. Instead, he remains Hiddink\u2019s problem for a little longer. \u201cI have sympathy for him but nevertheless talk about how he can control himself,\u201d the veteran said. He had coaxed Costa back to form with comforting words but accepts there are limits to the powers of his eloquence. \u201cI do not have any guarantee \u2013 because he is not a machine, he is a human being \u2013 that he will not one time explode a bit.\u201d Lukaku proved explosive in rather more admirable fashion. A five-minute double transformed a dull draw into a potentially catalytic win. A storming solo run showed his capacity as a game-changer. Such potency could have been unleashed in a Chelsea shirt but he only started one league game for them. Chelsea recouped \u00a328m when selling the Belgian in 2014. His value has escalated subsequently, prompting suggestions they may return to Goodison with a club record bid. Everton have been reluctant sellers over the years, their pride meaning they resent the suggestion they are a stepping stone to the top. Farhad Moshiri\u2019s purchase of 49.9% of the club has meant ambitions have been expanded and budgets increased. It does not necessarily mean Everton will retain their prized assets. \u201cNot really, no,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said, when asked if the key to future success was repelling bids for youthful jewels such as Lukaku, Ross Barkley and John Stones. The soundtrack to Everton\u2019s win against Chelsea in September was the Beatles-inspired: \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy you Stones.\u201d Now it transpires it might. \u201cIf Manchester United cannot keep Cristiano Ronaldo, that is a sign of a modern game,\u201d Mart\u00ednez argued. \u201cIf you sell a player for those sorts of amounts, you can get the benefit of adding three or four players.\u201d An expensive upgrade is envisioned at Stamford Bridge. Antonio Conte should be confirmed as manager soon. Thoughts are already turning to next season. For now, Chelsea, who long exuded an unshakeable sense of purpose, find their games deprived of their usual meaning. Eleven points adrift of the top four, they have exited two competitions in four days, leaving them in limbo with an interim manager and an interlude before competitive matches acquire their normal significance. Hiddink is a caretaker contemplating the prospect of revolution. \u201cIt is not for me to put my footprint on it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are in charge must make the analysis.\u201d He will be an avuncular observer, looking for evidence of character. \u201cNow is a difficult time and it is good to see who is standing up,\u201d he said. The implication for Chelsea\u2019s underachievers is clear. They have Conte to impress, if not Hiddink. \u201cIf you are a player at a big club, it is a privileged situation. Players should act towards that,\u201d the 69-year-old said. \u201cThey should show they are worthy of playing at a big club.\u201d For swaths of this season, Costa, along with Radamel Falcao, Eden Hazard, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, Nemanja Matic, Oscar and Pedro, has not. The striker\u2019s capacity to cause mayhem meant that one whose commitment has been more of a constant, John Terry, played his final FA Cup game for the club as a makeshift attacker. It was a snapshot of how a game, and a season, went very wrong for Chelsea. Man of the match Romelu Lukaku (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
