The mind's eye demands blackberry-laden hedgerows and a keeper's cottage; the reality is two Chinese restaurants and a fish-and-chip takeaway within 500 yards. Once inside the kitchen of rugby's most fervent Countryside Alliance supporter, it gets worse. Instead of a ferret or, perhaps, a brace of partridge, a fake tortoise is visible out on the lawn. The Northampton and Scotland flanker's shotgun licence has expired, barring him from storing a firearm on the property; even Ben, his \"very dim\" lurcher, turns out to be a closet town dog. It is enough to make Madonna, in her hastily purchased tweeds, seem like Clarissa Dickson Wright. Identifying a true son of the soil, happily, is about more than checking for a glassy-eyed moose above the fire, listening to tall stories (\"I obviously ride to hounds most weeks ... Saints' coach has given us all a horse ...\") or discovering plus-fours in the hall. Professional etiquette demands Northampton's home game against Bath today is the affable Pountney's first priority but his other weekend commitment, tomorrow's Liberty and Livelihood march in London, is proof his heart still belongs in the countryside regardless of his postcode. His legion of frustrated opponents, who normally regard Budge (a childhood nickname derived from his older brother Stuart's description of his baby sibling as \"my little budger\") as a ball-killing menace, would scarcely recognise the caring human being waxing lyrical on his pet subject. When he is not busy inserting his battered body beneath the studs of others, shrugging off pain to a worrying degree (never mind the Countryside Alliance, the buckets should be passed around now for Pountney's arthritis treatment) the 28-year-old Pountney has carved himself out an articulate new role, not least in reminding city-dwellers that social hardship and idyllic scenery are not mutually exclusive. Hunting may not be his scene but halting the steady erosion of rural life and jobs - his father, who was a farm manager in Hampshire, has been among those to suffer redundancy - matters big-time. He has already donated rugby-coaching days to the cause, which he feels revolves primarily around civil liberties. \"I'm not doing it just because my father was made redundant but also because of all my friends in the countryside. People have got to be allowed to do their jobs. They can't have people knocking them from the outside, saying 'You can't do that because we don't feel you should'. \"The British countryside is a stunning place and, if the rural industries go, it won't be looked after. It'll just degenerate into a mess. This is not just about hunting, it's the whole shebang. I would have loved to have gone into farming but even 20 years ago my old man was saying 'It's going nowhere, you can't afford to do this'.\" Instead, in defiance of every convention, the lad who enjoyed rough shooting and beating across the flinty Hampshire fields around Sparsholt grew up to be captain of Scotland. Having represented England at Under-21 level, his Scottish qualification came via a grandmother from the Channel Islands which enabled him to choose any of the home unions; his rural background has also helped since he won the first of his 28 Scotland caps in 1998. \"I always felt I was accepted. Perhaps I connected with other guys in the squad because quite a few were country boys like me.\" Is it just coincidence or something more intriguing that village-reared lads like Pountney, Phil Vickery and Ireland's Keith Wood have all captained their respective countries this year? \"Perhaps it's because we just get on with it,\" he shrugs. \"We don't mess around, we're not flash guys - well, apart from Woody - and we work bloody hard.\" Such self-effacement clearly suits both Scotland and Northampton; Pountney is happy to serve under Bryan Redpath at international level and sees no problem rotating the club leadership with John Leslie, his next-door neighbour and today's captain. \"It was quite difficult for everybody to get used to at the start because there's the traditional thing of 'He's the captain, blah-de-blah' but, to be honest, I quite like it. I just get on, get my head kicked in and enjoy it.\" Bath, though, will find the redeveloped Franklins Gardens a fearsome venue - \"It puts the fear of God up some teams\" - and that the Saints are stealthy opponents. \"We're quite happy where we are in the table, not least because no one's talking about us,\" smiles Pountney, suddenly looking like a fox spotting a possible backdoor route into the henhouse. \"We'll just sit quietly and get on with it.\" As one of the sport's nice guys, it is also to be hoped Pountney's body holds out beyond next year's World Cup; among the reasons he and his wife Ali, a PE teacher, moved into town from an outlying village, even before Wayne Smith revealed his penchant for 7am squad sessions, was the post-training stiffness Pountney suffered during the 20-minute drive home in his Land-Rover. Now he can at least nip home at lunchtime to walk the dog but his medical history, not least his oft-broken nose, will one day be used as a cautionary tale. Tomorrow's march, though, is all about highlighting the pain of others. \"The inner city is the real buzzword at the moment but there's a lot of problems out in the country,\" he says, gently stroking lurcher Ben's ears. Those seeking to assist village post offices and schools, or even former gamekeepers contemplating suicide, could not have a better ambassador."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
