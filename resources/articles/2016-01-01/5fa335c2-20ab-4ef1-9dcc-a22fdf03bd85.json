Youthful promise and wise heads combined for a comfortable win over the League Two side who, as suspected, missed their best chance of an upset at St James Park. Calculated Klopp\u2019s selection may have been, risky it was not. Sheyi Ojo became the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup history with a majestic curler into the top corner of the Kop net, Joe Allen delivered the early lead that Anfield craved and Jo\u00e3o Carlos Teixeira completed the scoring on an encouraging night for the young prospects. Jon Flanagan\u2019s long-awaited return from injury made it a perfect night for Klopp. \u201cA few days ago I could not have imagined I\u2019d enjoy an FA Cup replay but I really did, so thank you FA Cup,\u201d beamed the Liverpool manager. West Ham United await in round four on Saturday week. Exeter flew into John Lennon Airport enthused by their 2-2 draw with the Premier League side on home soil but never came close to repeating that performance or scaring Liverpool for a second time. Simon Mignolet marked his new five-year contract with the most comfortable outing of his season. The only frustration for Anfield lay in the ponderous touch of Christian Benteke, a striker clearly struggling for confidence, yet even he ended the contest after telling contributions for Allen\u2019s and Teixeira\u2019s goals. Greater understanding, a better pitch and more guidance produced an immediate improvement from Liverpool\u2019s makeshift FA Cup team. Benteke started against Paul Tisdale\u2019s team, as in the first meeting though not in the subsequent Premier League games against Arsenal or Manchester United, and the striker was joined by Allen, Jordon Ibe and Mignolet as a shortened injury list increased Klopp\u2019s options. Liverpool did not make the mistake of allowing Exeter to establish a rhythm for a second time. Anfield\u2019s youngsters trained together for only 40 minutes before the draw in Devon. They had three full training sessions before the replay and what little rapport developed at Melwood told as Liverpool\u2019s senior and inexperienced players combined for an early lead. Brad Smith, the Australian who secured the replay with a late equaliser at St James Park, was instrumental in the breakthrough. Liverpool\u2019s left-back exchanged passes with Benteke on the edge of the penalty area and showed great awareness as he sprinted towards the byline to cut the ball back for Allen to score from close range. The Wales international started in a more advanced role with the composed, intelligent Kevin Stewart operating as the holding midfielder and the licence to venture forward paid dividends. Benteke\u2019s part in the opening goal also merited praise. His return pass to Smith was perfectly weighted behind the Exeter right-back Christian Ribeiro and helped Liverpool settle while puncturing the optimism of the 6,000 away fans who had impressively made the long journey north. Exeter\u2019s goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik was busy throughout, in contrast to Mignolet who had one cross to catch before half-time with the visitors unable to find any time or space on the ball to supply Clinton Morrison. Olejnik denied Teixeira, Cameron Brannagan and Ibe as the youngsters shot from range before the interval. Ibe also clipped the top of the crossbar with an angled drive while Brannagan was inches away from extending Liverpool\u2019s lead from the edge of the box. The best chance of a second for the home side fell to Benteke, who met Teixeira\u2019s inviting left-wing cross with a clean header but failed to hit the target from six yards. The visitors made too many unforced errors and only after the hour mark exerted any pressure on the Liverpool defence. By that stage it was a defence containing Flanagan, given a rapturous ovation when he replaced Connor Randall for his first senior outing in 20 months. Flanagan has endured nothing but torment since the end of the 2013-14 season, when his contribution to Liverpool\u2019s title challenge resulted in a place on England\u2019s standby list for the World Cup in Brazil. Instead of establishing himself for club and country Flanagan underwent two operations on a serious knee problem and, with his Liverpool contract due to expire at the end of the season, the full-back\u2019s return was well timed and received. Ibe almost doubled Liverpool\u2019s lead when he hit a powerful left-foot shot that struck the underside of the bar and bounced on the goalline. Most, but not all of the ball was over the line and Exeter were reprieved a second time when Stewart was pushed over as he attempted to convert the rebound only for referee Neil Swarbrick to ignore the penalty appeals. Victory was ultimately secured in sublime fashion. Ojo impressed as a substitute at Exeter and had been on the pitch for only nine minutes as a replacement for Allen when he scored his first Liverpool goal. The 18-year-old took possession on the corner of the Exeter area and, with left-back Craig Woodman backing off, he accepted the invitation to shoot and curled a wonderful shot into the far, top corner. Benteke continued to test Anfield\u2019s patience but created the third with a measured pass to Teixeira, who made no mistake from 12 yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
