His decision to hold a referendum on the proposed European constitution is unquestionably a u-turn. Only last October he insisted categorically that \"there will not be a referendum\". It is also, most definitely, a sign of weakness. We don't know the precise calculations that led to the prime minister's change of heart, but they will have included fear of damaging Labour losses in June's European elections, Michael Howard's effective championing of the plebiscite cause (backed by the Liberal Democrats) and continued tabloid scaremongering about the proposed constitution. Mr Blair's u-turn is not, however, unprecedented. The thinking behind it - shelving a contentious and damaging issue until after a general election - is exactly the same as that which produced Labour's pledge before the 1997 election to hold referendums on the euro and devolution. The prime minister likes to portray himself as a strong leader, but when it comes to domestic matters it is his caution, rather than his boldness, that frustrates his colleagues (the opposite is true for foreign affairs). Scottish Labour MPs, for instance, were infuriated by his decision to not only promise a referendum on the creation of the Scottish parliament, but also compromise its power with a second question on possible tax-varying powers. That time, his decision paid off. John Major was unable to convince many voters during the 1997 election campaign that Mr Blair's devolution plans endangered the union. And once he was safely ensconced in Downing Street, the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly for a Scottish parliament with tax-varying powers intact. Mr Blair's pledge of a vote on the euro, however, has been less successful. Many Europhiles believe that by committing himself to a referendum, the prime minister forewent a historic opportunity to join the single currency. They hold that he should have taken Britain in when he had the chance - immediately after his first electoral landslide. Labour, however, became a lot more cautious about letting the people decide following the knife-edge vote that was the referendum on the Welsh assembly. That contest was so close that during the count many tired and emotional Labour activists publicly conceded defeat. When, in the early hours, the poll was won by the smallest of margins the then Welsh secretary, Ron Davis, called it a \"good morning for Wales\". It had also been a long night for Labour. Like the long-promised euro referendum, it seems that the government isn't planning to hold the constitution vote anytime this year. Today's announcement by Mr Blair's spokesman that a vote would only be held after the treaty has passed through both houses of parliament strongly suggests that the prime minister isn't planning to hold it until after next year's general election. That will undoubtedly chop away one of the Tories electoral platforms, but it presents the government with a big problem if it wins a third term. Not only will it be extremely hard to make the case for the constitution, but there is also no organisation ready to make that case. Britain in Europe, the cross-party campaign established with much fanfare to win the euro referendum, has withered on the vine during its long wait. After four years of twiddling his thumbs, its director, Simon Buckby, resigned last September. Its staff has subsequently shrunk by a third. Mr Blair will need a Rolls Royce campaign to convince the voters of the benefits of the proposed European constitution. Conventional wisdom says that Britain's traditionally Eurosceptic electorate will only back further EU integration when convinced that it will benefit them financially. That is why the government presents the case for the euro purely in economic terms. And that is also why Europhiles believe the case for the single currency can still be won, despite the polls. Unlike the euro, a European constitution has no easily discernible economic benefits. The voter must simply decide whether he wants Europe to have a constitution, something that many will see as a mark of statehood. It will be a hard sell indeed. Put like this, Mr Blair's trade-off doesn't seem a good one: derision now and the risk of calamitous defeat for a short-lived period of peace of mind. Perhaps he knows something that we don't - that the proposed constitution will never be ratified, that it will be killed off by a referendum in another European state before it ever has to face the people here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
