One is an ageing itinerant hippie (eccentric singer-composer Will Oldham). The other (edgy Daniel London), married and about to become a father, drives a Volvo estate, which in movies always signifies someone who's opted for the settled, responsible, unostentatious life. It's a minimalist piece to be savoured like a good short story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
