His songs are slow, thoughtful and intriguing (it's unfortunate that no lyrics or translations are provided in the sleeve notes), and here they are transformed by the different settings, with echoes of anything from Gypsy styles to north Africa and jazz. The other members of the band play their accompanying role brilliantly, from the subtle or exuberant violin work of Richard Bourreau to the rousing, harsh-edged vocals of the band's two Algerian sisters, Yamina and Nadia Nid el Mourid. The only disappointment is that the sisters aren't given a larger role. They provide some gloriously edgy backing on songs such as Cafe de la Marine, and Yamina shows some impressive saxophone work on Rue de la Solitude, but they don't take the lead spot until the 10th track. This album doesn't quite match the band's live shows, but it's a classy and original set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
