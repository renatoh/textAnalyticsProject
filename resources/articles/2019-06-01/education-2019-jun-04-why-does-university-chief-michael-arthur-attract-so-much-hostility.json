Today, UCL has grown to 42,500 students with plans to recruit a further 4,000, making it the largest UK university apart from the Open University. For the past six years, Michael Arthur, the softly spoken son of a cabinet-maker and a probation service assistant, who went to a state comprehensive in Harlow, Essex, has presided over this success story as UCL\u2019s provost (vice-chancellor). But he has not achieved Bentham\u2019s goal of the \u201cgreatest happiness\u201d among UCL\u2019s 6,500 academic and research staff. All university leaders encounter hostility, but few can have attracted quite as much as Arthur. Some UCL academics feel such a \u201cfrenzy of hatred\u201d against him that they would prefer \u201ca blind, three-legged elephant\u201d as provost \u2013 and that judgment, in a privately circulated note last year, came from his press officer (since departed). \u201cHe\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d one academic tells me. \u201cThis was once an egalitarian, collaborative place. It has become a Stalinist institution. The whole ethos has changed.\u201d Another says: \u201cUCL is being run as a business, not as a university.\u201d A poll of the 1,531-strong academic board (which includes all professors plus elected members) got 724 responses, of which only 100 declared their confidence in UCL\u2019s governance. Arthur says the poll was \u201cnot properly conducted\u201d. Some professors took allegations of \u201cacts of improper governance and breaches of the statutes\u201d to the university Visitor, a largely ceremonial post occupied at UCL by the master of the rolls, England\u2019s second most senior judge, currently Sir Terence Etherton. In an 86-page confidential report \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 he found no \u201csustained or intentional infringement\u201d of UCL\u2019s constitution but described Arthur\u2019s management style as \u201cmore top-down than that of some of his predecessors\u201d. On some occasions, Etherton continued, \u201cchallenge has not been received as it should have been\u201d. There was \u201ca loss of trust and morale\u201d among \u201ca significant number\u201d of academics (though not a majority) and that \u201ccannot be simply ignored\u201d. The academics\u2019 complaints are wide-ranging and some date back to 2015, when the Nobel prize-winning biochemist Sir Tim Hunt resigned his UCL honorary professorship after comments made about his \u201ctrouble with girls\u201d. Hunt\u2019s supporters said the university, anxious to protect its \u201cbrand\u201d, created an unnecessary fuss and gave Hunt no option but to step down. \u201cArthur was extremely unpleasant to him,\u201d said one insider. \u201cHe was given no opportunity to explain himself.\u201d Arthur replies: \u201cI am confident we accepted a genuine resignation.\u201d But the nub of the grievances concerns UCL\u2019s expansion \u2013 and particularly plans for a \u00a3516m, 11-acre second campus at the Olympic Park in Stratford, six miles east of the site it has occupied since 1826 in Bloomsbury, traditionally London\u2019s academic and high cultural heart. The first hole in the ground for UCL East has just been dug, Arthur tells me when we meet in his awesomely spacious office. Arthur has big ideas for the future: a school of politics and public policy to rival the Kennedy School of Government in the US; a school of \u201cthe health of the public\u201d; a business school for the real estate industry (\u201cfor estate agents?\u201d I ask; \u201cdefinitely not for estate agents\u201d, he says firmly). UCL, having recently swallowed the London University Institute of Education, will then cover just about all human knowledge and activity except theology and performing arts. But isn\u2019t UCL too big already? \u201cWe want to be a global player,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cRound the world, you\u2019re seeing universities of 90,000, 100,000 students. If you have critical mass, you can create outstanding cross-disciplinary research on things like climate change. You can do research that makes a difference.\u201d He mentions a treatment recently developed at UCL that makes HIV, the virus that causes Aids, untransmittable. If UCL didn\u2019t increase student numbers, thus maximising fee revenue, such research would have to be cut back. \u201cTo me,\u201d Arthur says, \u201cthat is unthinkable.\u201d His opponents disagree, saying UCL should make money from research spin-offs in areas such as healthcare, not from student fees, an unpredictable source of future income, particularly if the government carries out the Augar review\u2019s proposal to cut them from \u00a39,000 a year to \u00a37,500. They point out that, of the top 12 in the world rankings (UCL is 14th), none has more than 22,000 students and two have fewer than 10,000. \u201cBig universities reduce the staff and student experience,\u201d one senior academic says. \u201cThe university becomes a sausage-machine.\u201d \u201cArthur hasn\u2019t reached out to staff and got them to buy into UCL East,\u201d says Sean Wallis, a UCL research fellow in English and vice-president of the academics\u2019 union branch. Dissidents claimed that a \u00a3280m loan for the new campus from the European Investment Bank was rushed through without proper consultation. They accused Arthur of imposing stringent controls over \u201cdiscretionary funds\u201d \u2013 \u00a378m donated by academics from private consultancy fees and the like and spent, for example, on supporting PhD students and entertaining guest speakers \u2013 because they were needed as loan collateral (which UCL denies). Meanwhile, the Bloomsbury site was being neglected. In another poll, 423 out of 492 academics thought teaching facilities were inadequate and one commented that \u201cI have taught too many classes in rooms where the windows don\u2019t close and the heating doesn\u2019t work, with half the chairs broken.\u201d This may explain UCL\u2019s poor performance in the National Student Survey, in which it languishes in 119th place. What is he doing to improve the student experience? He says he has changed the promotion system, introducing \u201cteaching fellows\u201d to give teaching more recognition. He is also \u201cbringing research and teaching together\u201d and has gone through every degree programme to see how that can be done. He explains: \u201cIf you explicitly engage students with the research process, they acquire really important life skills. They begin to understand how knowledge is created, how to deal with uncertainty, how to work in a diverse team. These are skills they can take to employers. I\u2019m not trying to create 42,000 researchers but 42,000 critical thinkers and leaders.\u201d He admits, though, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing as well on teaching as we\u2019d like. We are on a journey.\u201d When he started his last job, as vice-chancellor at Leeds in 2004, that university was, he says, \u201cat a similarly low level in the student survey. Now it\u2019s in the top three.\u201d Before Leeds, Arthur spent almost his entire academic life at Southampton University, starting a medical degree in 1972, going on to a research fellowship, a lectureship and a professorship, and then becoming a dean in charge of one-third of the university. His nine years at Leeds were also marked by a vote of no confidence from the academics\u2019 union amid accusations that he was sacking 700 staff. In fact, he says, it was a voluntary severance scheme. If he attracts trouble, it\u2019s because \u201cI don\u2019t shirk the need for change\u201d. He is not, I suspect, a natural enthusiast for the marketisation of universities, even though, as Russell Group chair from 2009 to 2013, he campaigned for rises in fees and ending the cap on home student numbers. \u201cWould I have invented fees? Probably not. If I had been prime minister, I would probably have kept government funding.\u201d Since UCL was already set on expansion before Arthur arrived, it is perhaps just bad luck that he finds himself in the frontline of bitter struggles to reconcile the demands of a new funding regime with traditional academic values. But I wonder also if, as he climbed the promotion ladder, he suffered some kind of identity crisis that caused him to emerge, according to his UCL critics, as a man who lacks either a medic\u2019s \u201cbedside manner\u201d or a university leader\u2019s political skills. At Southampton, he was known as Mick Arthur. But he arrived at Leeds as Michael, his mother having insisted that Mick didn\u2019t fit his status. He cheerfully confirms this, seemingly unaware of what a psychologist could make of it. Though there was talk of financial crisis two years ago, shortly after UCL took out loans to start work on the new campus, Arthur tells me with pride that the university is now on a sound financial footing, with borrowing as a percentage of turnover below the Russell Group average, and zero academic staff redundancies during his tenure. At the end of the next academic year, Arthur is due to retire. But some UCL staff predict \u2013 and hope \u2013 that he will be gone some months before then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
