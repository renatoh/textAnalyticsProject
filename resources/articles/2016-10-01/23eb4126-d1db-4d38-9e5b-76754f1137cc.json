Jansson is best known for her blobby superstars the Moomins, who became so much more famous than their creator that they decorated the tail fins of Finnish planes, and even the wristwatch of former president Tarja Halonen. A major retrospective of her art will feature newly discovered artwork for the strip cartoon of the Moomins, found in a mass of material sent for storage by the defunct London Evening News paper, which had serialised her work for years. The exhibition will showcase her as a serious artist as well as an illustrator, including self-portraits, landscapes, and her work for the Finnish satirical magazine Garm, which first accepted her work when she was just 15. She went on to create hundreds of illustrations and cartoons for the magazine, including more than 100 covers, which in the war years often featured caricatures of Adolf Hitler and other instantly recognisable Nazi figures. One of the hippo-like Moomins, who hibernate through the winter and wake up as the snow melts in their idyllic valley, made a first appearance in a cameo role in Garm in 1943. The first Moomins book was published in 1945, and they became famous across the world from magazines, books, and television programmes including a 104-part Japanese animated version. Jansson, who died in 2001, was born into a family of artists in Helsinki in 1914. Her family was closely involved in her work and has kept control of the Moomins \u2013 once turning down an offer from Disney for the rights. Her niece Sophia Jansson, now creative director of the Moomins, said she was delighted the gallery would now show the full range of her work in the exhibition opening in October 2017. \u201cIt was hugely important to Tove that she be recognised as a talented fine artist in addition to being creator of the Moomins,\u201d she said. \u201cBalancing her painting and her other projects alongside the demands that the Moomins made of her was something she struggled with all her life.\u201d Sointu Fritze, chief curator at the Ateneum museum in Helsinki and lead curator for the exhibition at Dulwich, said Jansson\u2019s art and stories were very relevant for Europe today. \u201cHer entire oeuvre and way of thinking are characterised by the acceptance of differences,\u201d Fritze said. \u201cAlthough the family circle \u2013 both the artist\u2019s own and the fictional Moomin family \u2013 is central, the door is always open for those seeking shelter.\u201d The exhibition will be at the Dulwich gallery in south-east London from 25 October 2017 to 28 January 2018. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to recognise that, although the first major retrospective in the UK, the Dulwich show is not the first UK exhibition of Tove Jansson\u2019s art."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
