The Healthcare Commission said the government recommended counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy for all patients with schizophrenia or suspected schizophrenia. But the inspectors' first national review of mental health services found only 50% were given access to it. They also discovered that mental health patients living in the community cannot rely on getting NHS help in a crisis. Just over half are not provided with an out-of-hours number of a mental health worker who can be contacted in an emergency. Anna Walker, the commission's chief executive, said: \"For care in the community to work for the mentally ill more access is needed to talking therapies and out-of hours crisis care.\" But a survey of more than 19,000 service users found 77% rated overall standard of care as excellent or good and 86% appreciated the attitude shown by community psychiatric nurses. The commission said the best mental health services in England were provided to patients in Bournemouth, Dorset, Buckinghamshire, Southampton, and Harrow in London. The worst were in Stockport, Portsmouth, Manchester, Brighton and Hove, and the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Hillingdon. The commission rated 9% of local teams as excellent, 45% as good, 43% as fair and 3% as weak. Health minister Rosie Winterton said a programme was launched earlier this year to improve access to talking therapies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
