They are in their early seventies. Thin and white, they suck hard on wet roll-ups as if the ember of the cigarette might be enough to keep out the winter. Every morning they wait by the newsagent's to unload the paper van. Every morning. To do a job that gives them more in the way of dignity than money. They are a strange species, bordering on obsolete, so the education system would have you believe. They are white working-class males. Forgive the dewy romanticism here, but these men operate as daily emblems in my life of something precious to which I feel insufficient value is ascribed. White working-class men, lest we forget, were the cannon fodder of two world wars who were the owners of a proud work ethic. I wonder, then, why the grandchildren of the two old guys who get up at 5am each day simply so they may speak of their work, are so easily put aside by the education system. The recent government white paper, in a section entitled \"Black and Minority Ethnic Children\", quotes the awful and relatively well-known fact that only 17% of black Caribbean boys achieved the requisite standard in GCSEs last year. This is an issue that requires funding, input, new thinking and risk-taking. It has had some publicity. People are aware of this crisis. A four-line, tacked-on addendum reveals in a startlingly matter-of-fact piece of understatement: \"Many white working class boys can also fail to fulfil their potential.\" You can almost hear the subtext screaming, \"but that's OK. No one gives a toss about them. Their community and pressure groups don't have much of a voice, and they'll all get jobs as plumbers anyway.\" As the white paper states, white working-class boys who are eligible for school meals perform worse at school than almost any other group. \"Some schools,\" the white paper says, \"have developed successful approaches to meeting the needs of this group and we will ensure that this best practice is shared more widely.\" I've attended a practice-sharing session. Last year, the Specialist Schools Trust invited delegates to learn from leading practitioners in key specialisms. It was a brilliantly run day. My excitement, however, was reserved for the seminar, run by Robert Clack school in Dagenham, entitled \"How to raise the achievement of white working class boys\". I hopped along, pen in hand, ready to make copious notes. I was to be disappointed. Sadly, there was no magic bullet, and little a classroom teacher could apply. Robert Clack school was quite simply a very well run school in a predominantly white, working-class part of town. Why then are white working-class boys doing so badly? A former colleague suggests it is because of the patrician nature of the English education system: set up by the ruling and middle classes for their own benefit. \"Working-class people have an established and justifiable resentment for most things they consider to be middle class,\" my colleague writes. \"The white working-class never really feel part of the education system simply because they are not represented in it. When a teacher arrives in school who looks, behaves and sounds like them, in my experience, they react positively.\" So is it just a question of having no identifiable role models? I doubt this. There are many (though probably not enough) working-class teachers in our schools. My former colleague moves on to more explosive ground. \"They also have to contend with the inability of schools to promote positive white role models and the steady erosion of their culture. Winter celebrations replace Christmas holidays, McDonald's the pie and mash shops and many local pubs have been closed down. Is it any wonder that the working class feel disaffected and transfer this disaffection on to their children, who arrive at the school gate angry and socially marginalised?\" It's all too easy for those living outside such communities to dismiss such views. But I too have sat through whole rafts of assemblies about Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks and Jessie Owens. The only white person mentioned all term is Adolf Hitler. And I've watched the white kids squirm with guilt, embarrassment and shame as they are force fed a daily diet of the doctrine of their own obsolescence. The \"poems from other cultures and traditions\" section of the syllabus gives teachers a brilliant chance to discuss race and cultural heritage. But I have this lingering worry that, when asked for a positive white working-class male role model, we grope in the direction of David Beckham and then are lost. There must be more identifiably working-class white male writers in Britain than Simon Armitage. Surely, there's also the odd chemist or mathematician. It might be nice if white kids got to know about them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
