The first blast happened outside a hospital in Mahmoudiya this morning. The victims included four police officers, three women and two children, doctors at the hospital said. Police captain Ibrahim Abdealla said a suicide bomber had been targeting US military vehicles parked near the hospital, around 20 miles south of Baghdad. Another police official, Major Fala al-Mohammedawi, said the soldiers had been giving toys to children in the hospital. \"It was an explosion at the gate of the hospital. My children are gone,\" a woman who was being treated for wounds to her face and legs said. Mahmoudiya is a mixed town of Sunni and Shia Muslims, and is in an area well known for attacks on US-led forces. Shia Muslims often travel through the area in order to visit shrines in the south of the region. The second car bomb exploded in Hilla, south of Baghdad, near a crowded soft drinks stand this evening. At least 11 people died and 17 were injured in the attack, said hospital officials. Police captain Muthanna Khalid said it was not yet clear whether the car had been driven by a suicide bomber. Hilla, a Shia city, has been a frequent target for suicide attacks. In February, a suicide car bomber killed 125 people in the deadliest single strike since the fall of Saddam Hussein. The violence in Iraq intensified in the run up to the country's referendum in October, and Iraqi authorities have warned that will occur again ahead of parliamentary elections next month. Today's bombings are the latest in a wave of attacks that have killed nearly 200 people since last Friday. Elsewhere today, five US soldiers were killed in three separate attacks. Two were killed by a roadside bomb attack south west of Baghdad, and two were shot in the same region. A fifth was shot in the centre of the city, US authorities said. On Wednesday, a US solider died from wounds suffered in an explosion in a town west of Baghdad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
