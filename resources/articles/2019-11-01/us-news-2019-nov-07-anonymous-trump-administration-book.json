The unnamed author, identified only as \u201ca senior official in the Trump administration\u201d, also says that colleagues considered resigning en masse in order to raise alarm about the president\u2019s conduct, but ultimately decided against it, according to the Post. The extracts obtained by the Post are due to appear in A Warning, a book written by the unnamed person who last year wrote a New York Times column critical of the president. They paint Trump as volatile and incompetent, while also describing how he made racist and misogynistic statements in private. In the book, the author describes Trump\u2019s approach to the presidency as \u201clike a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport\u201d. The author also describes how Trump\u2019s impulsive Twitter antics often left senior officials \u201cwaking up in the morning \u2018in a full-blown panic\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him,\u201d the author writes, according to the Post. \u201cYou\u2019re stunned, amused, and embarrassed all at the same time. Only your uncle probably wouldn\u2019t do it every single day, his words aren\u2019t broadcast to the public, and he doesn\u2019t have to lead the US government once he puts his pants on.\u201d The White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham criticized the book and the author\u2019s decision to remain anonymous. \u201cThe coward who wrote this book didn\u2019t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies,\u201d she said on Thursday. She said reporters should \u201ccover the book as what it is: a work of fiction\u201d. The Post said the author decided to publish the work anonymously so as not to distract from the president and the larger issues. \u201cI have decided to publish this anonymously because this debate is not about me,\u201d the official writes. \u201cIt is about us. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this \u2018cowardice\u2019. My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course.\u201d The book includes passages describing Trump allegedly making misogynistic and racist comments behind the scenes, commenting on people\u2019s weight or appearance, and at one point describes the president as trying to affect a Hispanic accent during an Oval Office meeting to complain about migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. In one alleged incident, Trump said: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children. They are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d The unnamed author\u2019s original op-ed in the New York Times, headlined I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration, alleged that some senior White House officials collaborated to protect the country and public from some of Trump\u2019s most dangerous and irresponsible impulses.
