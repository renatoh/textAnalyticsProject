You wrote down five works of art you would choose to have in your home, given the pick of any work of art on earth. At that point, Dave Eggers, who had been ignoring us, insisted on joining in, and the whole thing snowballed. OK, that's not true. Higgie's game is real, but I wrote down my choices in a field outside Sheffield. Frieze was asking artists, writers and gadabouts to participate, and now the magazine has published the lists as part of its 10th anniversary issue. The pleasure in the results lies in the fulfilment and quashing of expectations, wondering who's being honest, who's trying too hard. It's deliciously predictable that David Lynch should choose to live with three Bacons, a Hopper and a Bosch - a list one guesses is very much from the heart. Or is it? It's a clever game, because a work of art you want to be with is not necessarily the work of art you think is the greatest. It's one you want to live with every day, wake up and see opposite your bed, stroll past in the hall. I can't imagine living with some of my favourite artists: Turner, Rembrandt, Picasso. Instead I'd have Watteau and Gainsborough, the most erotic painters in history, in the bedroom, Warhol's Brillo Boxes in the kitchen, and Pollock and Titian in the living room (though the Titian would require structural alteration - his Assumption altarpiece would have to be imported with the wall of the Frari church in Venice). Louise Bourgeois's choice of the great modernist Fernand L\u00e9ger is not just taste, but nostalgia - L\u00e9ger was her teacher. Selecting works that are all by the same artist might seem pretentious, but then Bridget Riley's fondness for C\u00e9zanne is scarcely surprising in this artist of obsessive abstraction. That's not to say there's not lots of showing off. Chris Ofili's choices are excellent, erudite, and all feature monkeys. Now here's the surprise. Who's the most popular artist with these art-world types? Damien Hirst, Gerhard Richter? No, Pieter Bruegel the Elder - the most chosen work is his Hunters in the Snow. The peasant-solid, rural-strong, winter world of this 16th- century Flemish master provides nourishment, a beefy, weather-beaten toughness - exactly the kind of art you want to see in your home every day.
