After a two-day meeting, the central bank announced rates would rise a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, the ninth such move since late 2015. The rate rise further signals the Fed\u2019s confidence in the US economy. The closely watched Fed fund rates is used to benchmark interest rates worldwide, and the Fed\u2019s move is parsed by investors worldwide for signals about the strength of the US economy. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 70 points after the announcement to finish the day down 1.49%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 39.2 points, or 1.54%. US stocks are on course for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. The selling spread into Asian trade on Thursday, where the Nikkei in Tokyo was down 2.3% and the Hong Kong market was off 1.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.8%. At a press conference, the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, said the US economy remained strong overall but added that some \u201ccross-currents\u201d had emerged. \u201cDespite this robust economic backdrop and our expectation for healthy growth, we have seen developments that may signal some softening,\u201d said Powell, signaling that the pace of rate increases may slow next year. Powell said that although US growth remained strong, globally economic growth had become more patchy. He said the Fed was carefully watching \u201cevent risks\u201d \u2013 including Brexit \u2013 for their potential impact on the US. But he added US financial institutions are well prepared for any outcome of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU and that the final decision should not have major implications for the US. \u201cHonestly, it shouldn\u2019t have major implications for the United States, but there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty because it\u2019s not something that\u2019s happened before,\u201d he said. Trump has waged a public campaign to halt further rate rises, a highly unusual move for a president, calling the increases \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfoolish\u201d and arguing the Fed\u2019s policy was \u201cthe \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to the US economy, larger than the administration\u2019s trade dispute with China. Last month Trump told the Washington Post he was \u201cnot even a little bit happy\u201d with his selection of Powell to chair the Fed. On Tuesday, as the Fed was meeting, Trump pressed the Fed to hold off from \u201cmaking another mistake\u201d. He pointed to a Wall Street Journal editorial that called for a pause in rate hikes, arguing that US growth may be slowing, Trump\u2019s tariff disputes have dampened trade and sales of homes and cars, both highly impacted by rate rises, have dipped. In spite of Trump\u2019s criticism the Fed voted again for another small increase in rates. All four of the Fed\u2019s rate increases this year have been approved on a unanimous vote. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, defended Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed on Tuesday. \u201cThe president is stating his opinion, which he is perfectly within his right to do,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cHe has been very clear about what his opinion is while at the same time he understands that the Fed is an independent agency. That doesn\u2019t take away the president\u2019s right to express his opinion on a particular matter.\u201d Powell defended the Fed\u2019s independence. \u201cPolitical considerations play no role whatsoever\u201d in the Fed\u2019s decision, Powell said, adding that the independence of the Fed is \u201cessential\u201d if the central bank is to do its job properly. Powell said the Fed based its decisions on the economic data it gathered and \u201cnothing will cause us to deviate from that\u201d. The Fed is charged with helping to keep unemployment low and controlling inflation. The latest rise comes as the US unemployment rate has dropped to levels unseen since 1969 and inflation has remained low. However, Trump\u2019s trade disputes and the threat of a government shutdown over funding his proposed border wall with Mexico have rattled investors and stock markets have been highly volatile. Powell said the Fed was watching the recent volatility in the stock markets but downplayed their importance. \u201cWe follow markets really carefully but remember, from a macro-economic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
