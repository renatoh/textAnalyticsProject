Age: New. Gone into the luggage business has he, as well as the punditry and a controversial nutrigenetics firm? Not so much into it, as on to it. Meaning? His face is printed on a suitcase. Whose suitcase? Where? Why? Whoa, one at a time. First: Kate Wright\u2019s suitcase. The ex-Towie star? And Rio\u2019s fiancee (#MrsFerdyToBe). And where? Instagram, obviously, and the airport. Kate and 16 of her closest friends jetted off \u2013 easyJetted, by the looks of it \u2013 to Mykonos for a secret hen do. Can\u2019t have been that secret. \u201cWe decided to have a social media detox to actually enjoy ourselves rather than be on our phones checking Instagram 24/7 \u2026\u201d Wright wrote. On Instagram. And now they\u2019re back, detox over. Correct. \u201cBe prepared for a LOT of piks,\u201d she wrote. And she wasn\u2019t lying. Including one that showed Rio had made the trip, too? Face on the case, muggage on the luggage, stag on the bag. Hunk on the trunk. Is it a thing, printing loved ones on luggage? Well, it probably will be now that Kate has shared it with her 1 million Insta followers. There has been a mini-trend for doing it with blankets, so perhaps this is just the next logical step. I can see the appeal of wrapping yourself warmly in the person you love when they are not there, but stuffing your dirty knickers and flip-flops into them \u2013 that is not quite the same, is it? But think how much more fun baggage reclaim would be. Also, it is much less likely that anyone is going to take your bag by mistake. In Kate\u2019s case (case \u2013 get it!), you would probably get a bunch of Brits breaking into a chorus of Rio as he appeared on carousel No 2. What if the luggage handlers were Man City or Liverpool fans \u2013 wouldn\u2019t a suitcase emblazoned with the face of a Man United legend be more likely to disappear altogether? Possibly, but there was no way Kate\u2019s hen do was going to be totally Ferdinand-free: she also carried a cuddly toy with Rio\u2019s face, which seems to have made it on to the plane. As seen on Instagram? Obvs. \u201cStrapped in and ready for take-off Hun,\u201d read the caption. So blankets, luggage, toys \u2013 where will this madness end? Printing your loved one on your own body? What, you mean like a tattoo? Oh, yeah. Knickers, then, is that acceptable? Great idea. See you on Dragon\u2019s Den. Do say: \u201cDid you pack this man yourself?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cIs that John Terry?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
