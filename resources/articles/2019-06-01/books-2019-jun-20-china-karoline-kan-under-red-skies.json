Kan\u2019s emotional discovery of what is euphemistically referred to as \u201cthe June Fourth Incident\u201d forms a moving part of her memoir about life as a millennial in China. \u201cChina collapsed for me suddenly,\u201d she writes of the day she used a VPN to skirt web censorship and first learned of the killing and injuring of thousands, as she binged hungrily on suddenly accessible western coverage. \u201cI no longer understood what was in front of me. I had no faith in what I had been brought up to believe.\u201d She explains: \u201cWhen you grow up in China, trying to find the accurate details of something that happened before you, sometimes they are not available. And it\u2019s like trying to solve a puzzle.\u201d Kan was born in 1989, the year of the massacre, and her memoir is a riveting blend of coming-of-age story, family history and cultural commentary, encompassing vast generational differences and the urban-rural divide. Kan is on the frontline of a rapidly changing country, having grown up poor in rural China, then attending university in the capital before working in the New York Times\u2019s Beijing bureau. Her job title was \u201cresearcher\u201d, as Chinese legislation does not allow citizens to be journalists for foreign-owned media. These days, she is the Beijing editor of website China Dialogue as well as a published author. It\u2019s been quite the rise. \u201cNobody in my family ever wrote a book,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even a journalist in my family or anybody who could be considered intellectual. So to me, it was a nice dream.\u201d She was never concerned about reprisals for her writing: \u201cI was nobody, just a writer, and also writing in English. So unless I decided to write something totally political about the Chinese president or the party, it was pretty much fine.\u201d Kan was almost never here: under China\u2019s one-child policy, her birth was forbidden. Kan\u2019s mother entered a protracted game of cat and mouse with the Birth Control Office, tricking doctors into believing she had been fitted with the mandatory uterine ring by putting an iron ring in her pocket during an X-ray. She was also able to evade forced abortion and forced sterilisation. Nevertheless, having Kan lost her her job as a teacher. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that Kan is a vocal feminist, heavily influenced by the experiences of the women in her family. Her great-grandmother had bound feet, and her grandmother narrowly escaped the same fate. Kan writes: \u201cAt first, my grandmother, Little Guiqin, was told to practise walking so she could get used to the pain. The torture lasted for a few hours a day. She\u2019d painfully and slowly pace up and down the yard. She\u2019d cry and cry but then she got lucky. Less than a week after the initial binding, revolutionaries put a stop to the tradition.\u201d She says now: \u201cI grew up in a traditional Chinese family from a small town where women naturally obey men. My teachers would tell me: \u2018You should choose a job that suits women, not compete with men.\u2019 I felt unhappy with it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any worse than male students. But at the same time I was afraid of being regarded as somebody weird, who doesn\u2019t fit in.\u201d Reading feminist literature and journalism at university opened her eyes, but also revealed the gulf between herself \u2013 an educated, urban young professional \u2013 and her farming family, some of whom could remember eating grass and dirt during the Great Chinese Famine. \u201cIf I spend three days in my home town with my family, by day three I want to escape back to Beijing, because I don\u2019t agree with them on many things. But I couldn\u2019t change them. It\u2019s not my job to change them. They were given different circumstances,\u201d she says \u2013 though the questions about when she is going to marry and have a baby \u201ckill me inside\u201d. The pace of change in China in the 20th and 21st centuries may have been dizzying, but there is a poignant, contrasting thread in the book: the parallel life of Kan\u2019s cousin, Chunting, who marries young and takes a job in a factory. Not all Chinese millennial lives resemble Kan\u2019s; Chunting is currently under great pressure to have a second child against her will. Does China\u2019s older generation have empathy for millennials? \u201cNormally they think we are so spoiled and have never really met real difficulties. You hear older people in China calling millennials little emperors or princesses. They think we use too much internet, that we don\u2019t pay enough respect to the seniors in the family. I think the gap is getting really big. And the change is so, so fast.\u201d After growing up on a diet of American TV, Kan recently visited New York for the first time, keen to see the city where they filmed Friends. How do she and her young friends feel about the US, given the anti-China rhetoric voiced by the current president? \u201cI always took it for granted that the relationship between the two countries will get better and better,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that we will live in the world that is getting more open and with more cultural exchange \u2026 but since last year, with the trade war, many young people in China are not so sure any more. Is the world turning better? Or is it going backward?\u201d \u2022 Under Red Skies: Three Generations of Life, Loss, and Hope in China by Karoline Kan is published by Hurst."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
