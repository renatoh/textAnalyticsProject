Nowhere more so, it transpires, than in the Australian\u2019s own mind. A year ago, Day turned up at Augusta National with a recent WGC victory to his name added to a Masters third-place finish in 2013 and lifelong ambition as perfect motivation. There was a key point undermining Day\u2019s hopes though; because of a serious thumb problem, he wasn\u2019t fit to compete. \u201cIt was pretty tough,\u201d he admits. \u201cI had been on some good form at the time and was thinking I was going to kick that on, feeling like I was going to have the year that Rory McIlroy had last year but unfortunately that wasn\u2019t meant to happen.\u201d The tie for 20th was actually remarkable looking back, and when Day discusses the woes that mothballed him in 2014. The fact he chats so openly about them is insight into a likeable, confident character. \u201cI came back early from injury just to play Augusta,\u201d Day explains. \u201cI had a chance of getting to No1 in the world if I won the Masters last year so I had two goals in mind; obviously winning at Augusta and becoming the world No1. \u201cI actually played well but didn\u2019t putt that great and found myself off for another six weeks after that. I came back again, had another six weeks off again. Later in the year I had a bulged disc in my back so it was a struggle.\u201d It was Day\u2019s thumb, not his back, that provided the significant element of fear. \u201cThe thing became, \u2018when will I come back?\u2019 or \u2018will I ever come back and play?\u2019\u201d he concedes. \u201cI was sitting there for three months out of the year wondering when my thumb was going to heal. I had three cortisone injections in four weeks, it wasn\u2019t getting any better, didn\u2019t feel good, still hurt and it became a strange feeling. \u201cI was wondering: \u2018Is this what is going to take me out of the game?\u2019 I love golf so much, I really enjoy competing out here against all these guys but there were times when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to play golf again because of my thumb.\u201d Day\u2019s back injury in the latter half of the season turned out to be a 12-week \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d. During that downtime he worked through a plan to modify his grip, ensuring a weaker left hand on the club and thereby reducing pressure on his troublesome thumb. \u201cThere was a lot of hyper-extension in my left arm and it was crushing down on the bone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe neutralised that and over time it started to feel better and better. \u201cYou can still feel it but it isn\u2019t anywhere near the point where I can\u2019t swing a golf club. Every now and again I will feel it but I can shake it off and walk on. The same applies to my back. I need to keep working hard on my condition, on my core.\u201d Day has already won this year, via a play-off at the Farmers Insurance Open. Even his attitude to that nods towards 27-year-old maturity. \u201cI feel good this year, I have had the same kind of start as last year and have won again, which is nice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing is, you can\u2019t let the great start calm you down and make you feel too comfortable. You have to keep on pushing.\u201d If a key to winning major championships is tasting what it is like to come up short, Day is worthy of attention in the coming days. The 2013 Masters is remembered for Adam Scott\u2019s triumph, ending an apparent Australian hoodoo at the event, but Day had actually held a one-stroke lead with three holes to play. He was the Masters runner-up in 2011, a position he has also secured twice at the US Open. The specifics of Augusta play directly into Day\u2019s hands, without even taking into account the compatriot\u2019s motivation derived from Scott\u2019s success. Greg Norman, the best Australian never to don a green jacket, remarked this week that Day is \u201cprimed\u201d having \u201crefocused and re-dedicated\u201d himself to golf. It was a necessary switch, by Day\u2019s own admission, after a spell of complacency. Unlike others, Day won\u2019t mask his Augusta ambition. \u201cThat is all I have dreamt about, for a long time; winning that tournament,\u201d Day says of the Masters. \u201cI feel like my game is suited to there. I hit it long and I hit it high. I feel like my short game can produce some good creativity around the greens and I think I\u2019m a pretty good lag putter from long distance on fast greens. I have had some pretty good finishes there but I\u2019m still just looking for that moment where I put the green jacket on. \u201cI have put in a lot of work to get to where I am right now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just shows that I need to put more in to get to where Rory is. He looks like he has done it pretty easily; there was a run of first or second in eight out of 13 events recently. That\u2019s unbelievable. That\u2019s really what being No1 is all about. You have to be mega consistent, inside the top 10 and top five plus winning every year. If that is what it takes, I have to do something about that and become more of a consistent player.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
