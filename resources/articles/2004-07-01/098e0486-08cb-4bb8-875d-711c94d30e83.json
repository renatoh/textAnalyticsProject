With tens of thousands of delegates, politicians, celebrities and media figures descending on 'Bean Town' for a week, the city is bracing itself for a week of debauchery as well as a week of politics. It is an unwritten rule of conventions that the more exclusive the event, the less information there is available. Top of the list is an 'Evening with the Clintons' tomorrow night. The venue is listed only as 'The State Room', without stating in which building or hotel. A close runner-up is the 'clam bake' held at the exclusive compound of the Kennedy family this afternoon. Would-be gatecrashers should not bother showing up on the off-chance: all guests will be picked up from a hotel. For a bit of Hollywood glamour, actor Ben Affleck - a Boston native - will be hosting pool and cocktails in a sports bar on Tuesday, joined by General Wesley Clark, who was briefly a nomination hopeful. Affleck will be appearing at another party on Wednesday, where he will be joined by fellow actor Alec Baldwin and comedian Chevy Chase. For those in need of female star power, Sex and the City 's Sarah Jessica Parker will also be in Boston, as will actor Ashley Judd. For delegates preferring rock glamour, Jon Bon Jovi will be providing the entertainment on Thursday's goodbye party when the conference wraps up. Boston promises to attract an impressive who's who from all sectors of public life, from ex-magazine editor Tina Brown, who will host a lunch for Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry's daughters, Alexandra and Vanessa. But alongside the celebrity parties and the endless political talking shops will be scores of events laid on by lobbyists and corporations, including Coca-Cola, Visa, JP Morgan and even Fritos. Conventions began as genuine forums for debate where party platforms were hammered out and fierce arguments took place as to who to nominate for the presidency. Only in recent times have they become TV-friendly extended adverts for a pre-selected candidate. \u00b7 In 1844, the Democrats eventually selected James Polk as their candidate after nine inconclusive votes (and Polk was not even nominated until the eighth ballot). The record for the number of ballots at a convention, however, is 103 at the Democrat convention of 1924. \u00b7 The first convention was not held by Republicans or Democrats. It was held in 1831 by a third party, called the Anti-Masons. \u00b7 The closest race in recent political history was between Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan in 1976, when Ford edged out Reagan by 1,187 delegates to 1,070. \u00b7 At the 1968 Democrat convention in Chicago, at the height of Vietnam, riots broke out. More than 15,000 troops were called up. By convention's end, there had been 589 arrests, with 119 police and 100 demonstrators injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
