The former British amateur champion made a strong start, picking up birdies in four of his first six holes to turn in 32. He collected another birdie before recording a bogey but recovered to make another birdie on his next-to-last hole. Hoey has totalled seven under, three strokes ahead of the joint overnight leader, Damien McGrane of Ireland, winner of last year's China Open, and Carlos Rodiles of Spain. Hoey came through the European Tour qualifying school at his sixth attempt last year and finished joint second at the Africa Open in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
