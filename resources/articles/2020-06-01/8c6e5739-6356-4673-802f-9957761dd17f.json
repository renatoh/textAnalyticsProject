In March, the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said modelling revealed the federal government was preparing for 50,000 deaths in a best-case scenario and 150,000 deaths in the worst-case scenario. In the same month, Prof Raina MacIntyre, the head of the biosecurity program at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, warned of a \u201cflu season but on steroids\u201d, and said \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Australians may die under a worst-case scenario. Health workers in NSW were told to prepare for 8,000 deaths over the duration of the epidemic, and that the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus could last for up to 22 weeks. As of mid-June, 102 deaths had been recorded in Australia, with about 400 active cases in the community. So what does this mean for the reliability of models? And were the experts and media wrong to make and report on such drastic predictions? According to the epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, \u201cmodelling cannot ever capture the truth, because that is not its purpose\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t categorise models into \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019, because it\u2019s a waste of time \u2013 they\u2019re all going to be wrong to some degree,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can never fully realise the complexity of human experiences with even the most complex maths, because our inputs are confined to the things we know. Imagine trying to account for every single potential transmission of Covid-19, from the casual contact of two people on public transport to the lengthy exposure in a movie theatre. Even the best, most sophisticated models only take the first steps in the tangled web of interconnectivity that we call society.\u201d He says the benefit of models, however, is that they provide information on a wide range of scenarios, and that the problem is governments and health officials rely on dozens of models, never just one. What the public should take away from the Covid-19 predictions is that they should distrust anyone who is certain of the future based on a model. \u201cIf a prediction is firm, solid and confident, it\u2019s probably so wildly off-base that you can ignore it entirely,\u201d Meyerowitz-Katz says. \u201cSome models may have been misleading, and some were clearly hilariously wrong, but others have provided enormous value in the fight against this virus.\u201d However, commentators have used Covid-19 modelling that predicted scenarios that never eventuated to suggest that models for other areas of science, including climate change, should not be trusted. Meyerowitz-Katz says such commentary revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about modelling and its uses. \u201cModels aren\u2019t meant to predict the truth, they allow us to look at what might be,\u201d he says. \u201cThe point with climate models is not that they are showing a specific increase, it\u2019s that no matter what the inputs the outcome is disastrous long term. So there\u2019s probably no one model that captures the exact changes that we\u2019ll eventually see, but overall we can say with a lot of confidence that the evidence points to a worrying outcome.\u201d Similarly, the early Covid-19 models that looked at worst-case scenarios were wrong, but they allowed us to see what might happen if we did nothing at all to control the outbreak. The epidemiologist Dr Kathryn Snow, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for International Child Health, agrees that models were useful \u2013 if they came from reputable sources. She says the beginning of the pandemic saw a proliferation of non-experts making back-of-the-envelope predictions that were shared on social media and even picked up by media. This added to the confusion. Modelling is a specialised field, and few health experts are qualified to comment on them. \u201cMany of the most frightening predictions made early in the epidemic did not come from infectious diseases modellers themselves,\u201d Snow says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t account for the public health response, or the fact that a majority of our cases at that time were imported, rather than being due to local transmission. I think a lesson for the media is to distinguish clearly between evidence provided by experts in a given specialised field \u2013 in this case infectious disease epidemiology and mathematical modelling of infectious diseases \u2013 and commentary provided by people from outside that field, even if they are highly qualified experts in other topics.\u201d In March and April, there was still a lot that we didn\u2019t know about Covid-19. Critically, we did not know how successful the public health strategy would be. Control efforts have thankfully proven extremely successful in Australia, and the catastrophe that is unfolding in the US and UK has so far been avoided. \u201cNobody made a mistake in thinking that might happen here \u2013 it was a very real possibility, as we\u2019ve seen elsewhere,\u201d Snow says. \u201cBut we acted, everybody around the country played their part, and we avoided it. We\u2019re one of the few countries in the world that has.\u201d Prof Hassan Vally, an infectious disease epidemiologist with La Trobe University, says despite their limitations, models are incredibly useful to help governments plan, especially when there is limited information, such as when dealing with a new virus. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the models projected what would have happened if we did not act decisively to limit the spread of Covid-19 in Australia, and so these give us an indication of what we averted,\u201d he says. \u201cIn many ways the model gave us a peek into a possible future for us. This is one of those situations where if you have any doubt as to what we prevented, you only need to look as far as US, Brazil, Italy or a number of other countries that have been severely affected to see what could have happened here. \u201cSo this is a fantastic public health success story for us in Australia as well as New Zealand. Many lives have been saved in these countries thanks to strong leadership, government listening to experts, and people making sacrifices for the good of the broader community.\u201d However, Prof Annette Dobson, an expert in biostatistics at the University of Queensland, says \u201can awful lot of rubbish was published, and not just in the news\u201d. Medical journals have also been guilty of publishing predictions made by clinicians and researchers who had little statistical experience, she says. \u201cIf you had statisticians looking at the data before it was published they could have picked up the flaws straight away,\u201d she says. \u201cThe context of the data should have been checked with statisticians, and in the rush to publish, unfortunately, some things were published that were just wrong.\u201d On the plus side, she says, society is beginning to understand and appreciate the work of epidemiologists and biostatisticians. \u201cPeople are beginning to understand what we do and why data and numbers are important, and what it\u2019s useful for,\u201d Dobson says. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician, says \u201cthe bright side\u201d of attention being focused on the worst-case predictions over more modest ones was people were compelled to comply with public health measures such as social distancing and hand-washing. \u201cWe did need behaviour change,\u201d he says. \u201cThe worry is if you overdo the predictions at the beginning people may eventually say \u2018this is garbage, I won\u2019t do anything\u2019. This would be a worry. This virus is still here, even though numbers are low, and there will be many disruptive things we need to continue for a while to keep it at bay.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
