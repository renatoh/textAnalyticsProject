The chief executive, Alex Mahon, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been very clear that the execs will not be based there because it\u2019s too small an organisation for me to pull that apart.\u201d She acknowledged the Guardian\u2019s report that up to 90% of Channel 4 staff were choosing to take redundancy rather than move to the new regional base in Leeds or satellite offices in Bristol and Glasgow. \u201cWe\u2019ve always expected \u2013 and have been very clear \u2013 that previous moves by the BBC show that 70% to 90% of people won\u2019t be able to take up the jobs, or will not choose to. It\u2019s often because people are in dual-income families,\u201d she said, adding that she personally expected to be out of London at least one day a week. \u201cThe great thing about that is that it makes lots of jobs available.\u201d Around 300 of Channel 4\u2019s 800 staff are being moved to new offices, with the majority going to a converted nightclub in Leeds. Although top executives will not be affected by the upheaval, they will be expected to travel regularly. Some heads of departments will relocate as part of the move. Channel 4 has said it hopes the move will create new jobs in television production companies based outside London. Mahon was speaking at the release of Channel 4\u2019s 2018 annual report, which showed that the public broadcaster increased its revenues to \u00a3975m, with digital growth offsetting a decline in traditional television ad sales. However, the broadcaster \u2013 which has always promoted its commitment to serving younger and more diverse audiences \u2013 saw an overall fall in its popularity among BAME audiences, while the youth channel, E4, lost a tenth of its 18- to 34-year-old viewers in a year. Mahon said younger viewers were switching to its All4 catch-up service, where there was a 24% increase in the number of requests for video, aided by increased availability of box sets and partnerships to show additional programmes. Channel 4 News also lost a tenth of its audience, despite winning a number of awards for its coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This was blamed partly on \u201cBrexit fatigue\u201d among audiences. The broadcaster said it was considering scheduling cricket World Cup highlights earlier in the evening, after being criticised for showing the only free-to-air coverage of the England-hosted competition after midnight, attracting small audiences in the process. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to play England games generally as early as we can in the schedule, subject to contractual commitments and to other schedule commitments that we have in place for long-running series,\u201d Ian Katz, the director of programmes, said. \u201cWhat you should see is England games coming forward in a number of cases to 10pm. As we get closer to the end of the tournament we\u2019ll see some games earlier.\u201d Channel 4, which acknowledged it could no longer compete with the likes of Netflix on the finance available for new shows, also announced it had struck a deal with independent producers which will make it easier for it to show programmes on its catch-up services. In return it will give up the rights to some secondary income, such as international sales. It also remains in discussions with ITV and the BBC about joining the forthcoming paid-for Britbox streaming service, which is due to launch at the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
