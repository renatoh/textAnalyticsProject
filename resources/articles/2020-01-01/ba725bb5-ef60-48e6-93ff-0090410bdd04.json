Giving a speech at a private dinner in London for his charity Sentebale, Prince Harry said: \u201cOur hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d He said he had not taken the decision lightly, but there was \u201cno other option\u201d. Speaking \u201cnot as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry,\u201d he said he had found the \u201clove and happiness I had hoped for all my life\u201d with Meghan. \u201cI know that you\u2019ve come to know me well enough over all these years to trust that the woman I chose as my wife upholds the same values as I do. And she does,\u201d he said. Both had done everything they could to play their roles for the country and fly the flag, he said. \u201cFor those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. \u201cThe decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly \u2026 there really was no other option.\u201d He added: \u201cI have accepted this, knowing that it doesn\u2019t change who I am or how committed I am. But I hope that helps you understand what it had to come to, that I would step my family back from all I have ever known, to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life.\u201d Appearing to lay the blame at the feet of the press, he said the media was \u201ca powerful force\u201d, adding that the UK was his home \u201cand a place that I love\u201d. He and Meghan would continue to \u201clead a life of service\u201d. Expressing his gratitude to the Queen and the rest of his family for their support, he said: \u201cI will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his life to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me.\u201d The prince told those gathered at the fundraiser for the charity, which helps young people in Lesotho, that he and Meghan \u201care taking a leap of faith \u2013 thank you for giving me the courage to take the next step\u201d. Harry is expected to fly to Canada within days, to join Meghan, and baby son Archie. They intend to spend the majority of their time there, as they begin independent lives free from any financial oversight from the royal family. The couple were forced to sacrifice their royal roles in exchange for \u201ccomplete and absolute\u201d freedom from Buckingham Palace financial scrutiny over commercial deals after being told they could not have it both ways, it is understood. During 10 days of \u201cintense\u201d talks between royals and aides after Harry and Meghan\u2019s bombshell announcement, the issue causing the \u201cangst\u201d was how they could embark on commercial enterprises in order to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. Netflix is among global companies already eyeing them up. The streaming giant\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said of working with the couple: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be interested? Yes, sure.\u201d The couple were unwilling to subject themselves to any financial scrutiny or review in future contracts they struck. The trade-off was they could not use their HRH styles, though they retain them. In another blow they will no longer be able to officially represent the Queen. The couple was told \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways\u201d and chose not to be constrained \u201cby some sort of review process \u201c by the institution on contracts they signed. As questions over their future remain, Meghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas Markle, has been outspoken in his criticism. Speaking to a Channel 5 documentary, yet to be aired, he said the couple was in danger of \u201cturning into lost souls\u201d . \u201cThey are turning it [the royal family] into Walmart with a crown on,\u201d he said. Under the arrangement announced on Saturday their new titles will be Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. They will repay the \u00a32.4m public funds used to refurbish Frogmore House, their official residence in Windsor, which will largely remain empty as they spend the majority of their time in Canada. They will no longer receive public funding through the Sovereign Grant, although will remain funded privately by the Prince of Wales. They will retain their patronages, but Harry, a former soldier, will have to give up his honorary military titles, including that of captain general of the Royal Marines, passed on to him by Prince Philip. Though \u201crequired\u201d to step down from royal duties, they will still be able to attend family occasions, such as trooping the colour. The negotiations are said to have been \u201cfriendly\u201d, in contrast to the \u201churt\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d felt by the Queen, Charles and William over the Sussexes timing of their announcement without forewarning. As they embark on the next chapter, they are said to be \u201cvery much feeling their way\u201d. They \u201cunderstand the parameters\u201d and there will be a period of transition to see if it can work. The commercial model has not worked in the past, most notably with the Earl and Countess of Wessex. This has caused the royal family the most \u201cangst\u201d because a model does not exist yet. Harry had recently been working as an executive co-producer with chat show host Oprah Winfrey on a series about mental health for Apple TV. Meghan has done a voiceover for a Disney nature film with fees going to a conservation charity. This indicates one direction they might travel in. But whether they will escape allegations of cashing in on their status is questionable. Already new video footage, showing the couple at the premiere of Disney\u2019s Lion King in London, is circulating. It shows Harry telling the film\u2019s director Jon Favreau that Meghan is available for voiceover work, with Meghan seemingly joking: \u201cThat\u2019s really why we\u2019re here \u2013 it\u2019s the pitch.\u201d The Queen, in her statement, acknowledged the \u201cintense scrutiny\u201d the couple has been subjected to. The question remains if it will be less intense in North America, where there are broader freedoms over issues such as privacy, and where use of paparazzi photographs is not constrained by the agreed stricter rules of the UK media, drawn up following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said of the couple: \u201cI think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future. \u201cAs I said before \u2026 I was sure the royal family, which has been around a very long time, will find a way forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
