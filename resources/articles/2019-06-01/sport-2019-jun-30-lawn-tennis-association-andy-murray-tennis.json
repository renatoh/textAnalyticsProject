The LTA came under fire after announcing an \u00a38.8m loss in its annual accounts last month, while recent figures showing that overall monthly participation in tennis has dropped by 9% lent weight to fears not enough is being done to build on Murray\u2019s success. Jamie Murray accused British tennis of wasting his younger brother\u2019s decade at the top earlier this year and there was embarrassment in March when the publication of a rebranding strategy by the LTA failed to mention the Murray family. However, Scott Lloyd, who replaced Michael Downey two years ago, said that he has a healthy, open dialogue with the Murray brothers and their mother Judy. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for what went before me,\u201d the LTA CEO said. \u201cAnyone that has a passion for tennis, as Andy and Jamie clearly do, wants to see our sport thrive. What I want to do is take a sharper focus on how we invest the resources we have available to make sure we are investing behind things that have the biggest impact. The greatest legacy for Andy and Jamie would be to have a sport that\u2019s thriving. \u201cJamie and I speak regularly. I think me, Jamie, Andy and Judy all share the same philosophy. We want the sport growing. That\u2019s about the grassroots first and foremost. We have a very healthy and open dialogue with Andy and Jamie.\u201d Lloyd was asked if the LTA has tapped enough into the Murray family\u2019s expertise. \u201cI\u2019ve known Judy for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked with her 20 years ago. Since I\u2019ve started we have had an open dialogue on what we can do together. \u201cWe are working closely with Jamie on a few things. We\u2019re working with him on a Challenger event we are bringing to Glasgow in September. This is all about trying to put on events in different parts of the calendar to sustain interest all year round. It\u2019s going to be called the Murray trophy. For Andy and Jamie to be involved in helping the LTA deliver programmes inspiring kids, of course that\u2019s what we want.\u201d Lloyd wants to alter the idea that tennis is an elitist summer sport and believes community programmes such as Serves, Tennis for Kids and Park Tennis will help. He is also encouraged about the LTA\u2019s plans to develop indoor courts in 96 areas across Britain over the next 10 years. \u201cI spent six months talking to people up and down the country about what more the LTA should be doing,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve set about trying to open tennis up. I actually think it is more affordable than people appreciate. Last year we saw participation in park tennis grow 35%. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked to identify where we need more indoor courts available on a pay as you play basis. We\u2019ve identified 96 locations \u2013 72 in England, 12 in Wales, 12 in Scotland \u2013 where there will be demand in tennis if there are indoor facilities all year round. \u201cWe have to work out what works best for British tennis and have a sharp focus on it, whether it\u2019s performance strategy, investment or grassroots programmes.\u201d Concerns that the landscape would be barren without Andy Murray, who will play doubles at Wimbledon as he continues his comeback from hip surgery, will be tested at SW19 over the next fortnight. \u201cInvesting in the 10-year performance strategy we launched last year will hopefully create a framework for athletically gifted children to take up tennis and ultimately become professionals,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIn the men\u2019s game we have Kyle Edmund, Cameron Norrie, Dan Evans. They\u2019re in fantastic form. We have Jay Clarke and Paul Jubb coming up. On the women\u2019s side the Fed Cup team are back in the World Group for the first time in 30 years. There\u2019s a lot to be positive about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
