Top stories If Donald Trump lied to the American people when he called reports he tried to fire Robert Mueller \u201cfake news\u201d, that would be grounds for impeachment, the independent counsel who investigated the Clinton White House has said. Ken Starr, who used Bill Clinton\u2019s false statements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky as grounds for impeachment, told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cLying to the American people is a serious issue that has to be explored.\u201d Some Republicans said on Sunday that reports Trump had to be talked down from firing Mueller were a serious concern and should prompt congressional action. The New York Times and others reported that in June Trump ordered the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, to fire Mueller. McGahn reportedly said he would resign rather than carry out the order, which he said would have a devastating effect on Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump dismissed the report, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d. He has repeatedly denied that he was considering firing Mueller. Roger Federer has won his 20th grand slam title with a stunning Australian Open victory over Marin Cilic which brought the tennis legend to tears. Federer beat Cilic 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 in just over three hours under the roof on Rod Laver Arena \u2013 then the 36-year-old father of four broke down in tears at the end of the courtside presentation. . And Caroline Wozniacki has ended years of doubt with her maiden grand slam win, with the Dane saying she now has nothing to lose after beating Simona Halep in an epic final. Australia is set to become one of the world\u2019s largest arms exporters under a controversial Turnbull government plan. Malcolm Turnbull has unveiled a \u201cdefence export strategy\u201d, setting out the policy to make Australia one of the world\u2019s top 10 weapons exporters within the next decade. \u201cA strong, exporting defence industry in Australia will provide greater certainty of investment, support high-end manufacturing jobs and support the capability of the Australian defence force,\u201d the prime minister said. The plan has been attacked by the World Vision Australia chief advocate, Tim Costello, as \u201cexporting death\u201d. \u201cThere is only one purpose in making a weapon and that is to kill someone with it,\u201d Costello said. \u201cDo we really want that to be what people think of when they see the brand \u2018made in Australia\u2019?\u201d The former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan says inequality is one of the biggest threats to Australia\u2019s way of life and has warned the country not to go down the same path as Trump\u2019s America. Swan said Scott Morrison\u2019s latest push for further company tax cuts, which would see the headline tax rate cut from 30% to 25%, would only serve to widen the growing gap between the rich and poor. Swan points to the US as an example of how it can all go wrong and says Australia should turn back before it\u2019s too late. Ten foreigners, including five British tourists and a New Zealander, have been arrested in Cambodia for \u201csinging and dancing pornographically\u201d, after a raid on a party in Siem Reap near the tourist destination of Angkor Wat. They face up to a year in prison and could spend six months in detention before the case goes to court, according to reports.

Sport The opening match at Perth\u2019s new Optus Stadium saw its first five-wicket haul courtesy of the five for 46 of Western Australia\u2019s own Andrew Tye, and even its first streaker. But it will have to wait a little longer for its first Australian win thanks to a virtuoso performance from Tom Curran, who bettered Tye with five for 35 and snuck England to a 12-run win in the fifth and final one-day international. Daniel Arzani is still a teenager but already towers over his Melbourne City team-mates from a statistical standpoint. Does City\u2019s coach, Warren Joyce, fully appreciate what a talent he has on his hands? Though Arzani is far from the finished article, when does a primary focus on what he can\u2019t do \u2013 as opposed to what he can \u2013 become stifling? Thinking time It has been a tough year for Australian polymath Tim Minchin, \u201cunbearable\u201d, he says, of life under Trump and the collapse of his $100m movie. Minchin and his family have moved from Los Angeles to Sydney and in doing so escaped one of the biggest political upheavals in US history. \u201cIt\u2019s awful living there with Trump,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m out of that country \u2013 I think it\u2019s really broken.\u201d A new start means new projects, including an upcoming ABC comedy, Squinters. Minchin talks to Steph Harmon about narcissicm, his lifelong apprenticeship and how the #MeToo movement is changing his industry. Before Trump\u2019s medical exam, 75 health professionals urged in an open letter to the presidential physician that he evaluate the president\u2019s neurological health \u2013 which Trump passed 30 out of 30. The president\u2019s dementia assessment and other specialist tests are available online, with the internet putting specialist knowledge into the hands of non-experts. The days of priestly castes of professionals are gone, and mostly for the better, but caution is still advised, writes the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor, Paul Chadwick. If there is a single economic policy that symbolises the dominant economic ideology of the decades from the 1970s to the global financial crisis, it\u2019s privatisation, writes the University of Queensland economist John Quiggin. For decades the public have been sold privatisation on the basis that it would provide finance for desirable public investments. It is striking that, given the near-universal political consensus in favour of neoliberalism, and particularly privatisation, that the public has never embraced this idea. Indeed, voters have become more resolutely hostile. What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has started a new feud, with the rap legend Jay-Z. In an interview on Saturday the singer rejected the idea that Trump had been good for African Americans, calling the president a \u201csuperbug\u201d in a discussion of his reported racist remarks, including calling a number of African countries \u201cshitholes\u201d. Overnight, Trump hit back on his favourite medium, saying: \u201cSomebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\u201d Media roundup The Courier-Mail reports on underhand tactics allegedly used by some \u201crogue\u201d Queensland funeral homes, including conducting mass cremations and chasing ambulances. The NT News splashes with the aftermath of a monsoonal storm that flooded Darwin streets, brought down gigantic trees and scattered debris across major roads. The ABC has a long read on Greenland, where people are embracing climate change. For many of its 56,000 residents, melting ice means money.
