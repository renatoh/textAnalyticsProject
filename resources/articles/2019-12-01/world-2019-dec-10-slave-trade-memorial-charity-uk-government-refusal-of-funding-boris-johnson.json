In 2008, Boris Johnson endorsed the proposal for a \u00a34m bronze statue depicting the history of slavery, saying Hyde Park was \u201ca fitting site for a permanent memorial to the millions who lost their lives\u201d. But last month his government refused funding, which meant its planning permission has lapsed and its future is in doubt. The memorial is being backed by prominent black Britons including Lenny Henry, Baroness Doreen Lawrence and Linford Christie. Patrons include the archbishop of York, John Sentamu, and Lady Davson, the great great great-granddaughter of William Wilberforce, the Hull MP who led the parliamentary campaign to end the slave trade in the British empire, resulting in its abolition in 1807. Last month, Johnson\u2019s government denied funding for the memorial although James Younger, the minister for communities and faith, said the government valued the charity\u2019s efforts partly because \u201cslavery and the slave trade were amongst the most appalling tragedies in history\u201d. The charity was granted consent to erect the statue in the Rose Garden of Hyde Park but it has managed to raise only \u00a370,000 through donations. The design consists of six free-standing figures, each representing part of the slave story, led by an enslaved African man holding aloft a pair of manacles. The government has supported memorials to the first world war, the Nazi holocaust and the massacre at of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995, but no project for slave trade victims, the backers of the slavery memorial say. They fear that reluctance to fund the memorial may be because slavery was \u201cour own atrocity\u201d and \u201cit is easy to take the moral high ground about someone else\u2019s atrocity\u201d. Earlier this year, Theresa May promised an additional \u00a325m for a new Holocaust memorial and learning centre on Victoria Gardens, beside the Palace of Westminster, bringing its state funding to \u00a375m. The backers of the slavery memorial have no objection to public funding for the Holocaust memorial, but believe they also deserve support. \u201cIt\u2019s not good saying they don\u2019t have the funds [for us] when three months later they produce \u00a325m,\u201d said Oku Ekpenyon,the founder and trustee of Memorial 2007, which was originally set up to try to erect a memorial to mark the bicentennial of the abolition of the slave trade in Britain 12 years ago. Ekpenyon said incidents such as the alleged racial abuse of a black footballer in the Manchester derby last Saturday highlighted the impact of failing to fund a project aimed at educating the nation about the history of enslaved Africans. Following the match, the pundit Gary Neville blamed politicians including Boris Johnson for creating a climate where racism was more acceptable. \u201cRacism as we saw at the weekend is not just confined to football, it\u2019s a societal issue and the government should be taking a lead on this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe transatlantic slave trade was based on racism. How can we eradicate racism if we are not prepared to face up to it? The black community are taxpayers as well and we are subsidising other memorials and we are not getting anything for ourselves.\u201d Madge Dresser, a honorary professor of history at Bristol university who specialises in the history of the slave trade and is Jewish, said: \u201cIt is important to memorialise both the Holocaust and the enslavement of Africans and they should not be in competition. In the interests of community cohesion the government needs to fund a proper memorial to the victims of the Atlantic slave trade.\u201d A spokesperson for the ministry of housing, communities and local government said there was no money available. They highlighted the government\u2019s introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 \u201cto stamp out modern day slavery and protect victims\u201d and added: \u201cThe government supports the International Slavery Museum [in Liverpool] which acts as a hub for resources on as well as examining aspects of historical and contemporary slavery.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
