Judge Kouadio Bouatchi said a jury unanimously voted to free Gbagbo. The prosecution had asked for a life sentence, saying she had participated on a committee that organised abuses against supporters of her husband\u2019s opponent after the 2010 election. More than 3,000 people were killed after the former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat to the current president, Alassane Ouattara. The trial, the west African country\u2019s first for crimes against humanity, was held in an Ivorian court after the government rejected her extradition to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. \u201cWe are happy. Since the start of the trial we proclaimed her innocence. The prosecution\u2019s case against her was empty,\u201d Gbagbo\u2019s lawyer, Mathurin Dirabou, told Reuters after the verdict was announced. Tuesday\u2019s acquittal was a surprise for many. Simone Gbagbo did not attend the trial in protest and was not present for the verdict. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed and sad for the victims today. Only international justice can fight against impunity, it seems. We can no longer trust Ivorian justice,\u201d said Issiaka Diaby, president of the association for victims of the crisis. Simone Gbagbo had already been tried and convicted in March 2015 of offences against the state and sentenced to 20 years in prison, a jail term that was upheld on appeal this month. Prosecutors in her war crimes trial alleged she was part of a small group of party officials from Gbagbo\u2019s Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) that planned violence against supporters of Ouattara to stop him taking power. Her husband, Laurent, is standing trial before the ICC on similar charges connected to the brief conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
