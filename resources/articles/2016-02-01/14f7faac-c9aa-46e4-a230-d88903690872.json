It did not particularly matter who the opposition were; the English rugby fan just wanted to see the team play. Now the first couple of hurdles have been cleared effectively \u2013 at times almost impressively \u2013 the energies are shifting, and the anticipation levels remain high as a result. For now the rhetoric has started to include the delicate notion of a two-speed Six Nations. \u201cThat was Scotland and Italy,\u201d the line goes; \u201cHow will Jones\u2019s England fare against Ireland, the champions?\u201d is the new refrain. Then it will be top-five-in-the-world Wales, who won so memorably the last time the two met. And so we can expect the escalation to continue on to the tour of Jones\u2019s native Australia in the summer. The man himself is trying to maintain a course somewhere between expectation and realism, sometimes talking his team up, more often playing down the achievement of the first two wins and reminding us of the catastrophic state we all perceived the national team to be in at the end of the World Cup. It is the classic post-regime-change dynamic. When asked when we might expect to see the best of his England team, he simply replies: \u201cIreland\u201d. Then he more or less admits that he is saying that to be bullish. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for,\u201d he confesses. \u201cWhether that happens or not, I\u2019m not sure. You are always hoping it\u2019s going to happen next week. Generally speaking, when a coach takes over, the first year you are coaching the previous coach\u2019s team \u2013 that\u2019s the reality. The second year, you can change it by 50%, the third year you can change it by 80%. Which means by the third year it\u2019s your team. Now that\u2019s where you should be at your best. But I don\u2019t say that because I don\u2019t want to have any excuses. We\u2019ve an England side here that\u2019s good enough to win, and I want to make sure they win.\u201d Jones shifted England\u2019s base in the fallow week between fixtures to the same Kensington hotel the All Blacks like to stay at when they are in town. He wants to preserve Pennyhill Park, their traditional base in Surrey, for the special atmosphere of Test week. The little touches a new coach likes to introduce are very much in evidence already, but there has not been time for the kind of dramatic revolution a man of Jones\u2019s reputation might be expected to wreak. So far, the noises from the camp have suggested even a kindly approach from the famously harsh taskmaster. The threat of his darker side, though, remains latent. \u201cOccasionally,\u201d says Dan Cole, when asked if he has seen glimpses. \u201cHe has a way of letting you know where you stand. If something is crap he will tell you. So far everything\u2019s been fairly positive. He\u2019s happy with the team. But at the same time, you can see \u2026 yes \u2026 when things aren\u2019t so good \u2026\u201d Until that day, or until he has a meaningful stretch of time with the players, it is a process of information gathering. \u201cEvery day he\u2019s learning more about what makes people tick,\u201d says Cole. \u201cYou bump into him in the corridor and he will ask you a question. He\u2019s building his knowledge of each individual, finding out what makes you work and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d On the field the focus has been on the set piece. The verdict so far: good lineout, poor scrum against Scotland; good scrum, poor lineout against Italy. \u201cEddie wants to go back to the traditional English rugby of 2003,\u201d says Cole. \u201cHe understands it is a work in progress. Overall we have the backing of the coach and every day we are working hard to get that improvement.\u201d Among the tutorials from outside that Jones has set up, Graham Dawe, the former England hooker, has been drafted in for a session. As with Jones\u2019s Japan, striking for the ball is back in vogue with England. The hookers are hooking again. \u201cEvery scrum,\u201d confirms Jamie George. \u201cWithout fail. There are slight differences. You have to get into a position to strike. That is something I have had to work quite hard on over the last few weeks, because it is something that doesn\u2019t come naturally to me.\u201d The breakdown is another area that is receiving attention. The much-longed-for David Pocock-style jackal is yet to emerge, but there have been glimpses of a dynamic approach to the tackle area. \u201cIf you look at the World Cup stats,\u201d says Jones, \u201cEngland were ranked eighth in breakdown attack and eighth in breakdown defence. So this isn\u2019t a temporary problem. It\u2019s been a problem for a long time, and therefore it takes a long time to fix. But we are definitely making progress.\u201d And if that means falling foul of the referee every so often, so be it. \u201cMost of the stats I see show that the most successful teams are quite heavily penalised. You want the number of penalties as low as possible but I don\u2019t think you have to put a number on it. Silly penalties are the most frustrating.\u201d England are clear of the field on the penalty-conceded count but they are also clear of the field \u2013 on points difference, at least \u2013 at the top of the Six Nations table. Comparisons with Stuart Lancaster\u2019s start in 2012, exactly the same as Jones\u2019s here, are inevitable. Two wins from two is a match for Lancaster\u2019s, but Lancaster\u2019s England got away with murder in their first two games, in Edinburgh and Rome, while Jones\u2019s have won with relative comfort. Then again, Jones has picked much the same personnel, unapologetically building on what was already there. The fun now will be to see if he can complete a new storey in time for his first home game \u2013 against those champions, Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
