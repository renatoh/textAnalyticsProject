Alongside Wodehouse and Saki are contemporary writers including Margaret Atwood and Ali Smith, the latter\u2019s bizarre tale of an unusual encounter on a shopping trip being one of the best things here. It\u2019s also hard to beat Kevin Barry\u2019s uproarious Beer Trip to Llandudno \u2013 a finely wrought tale of alcohol-fuelled male bonding. Under Occupation Alan Furst Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a320, 206pp One of the characters in Alan Furst\u2019s new novel, a publisher, remarks that his author is \u201ca master of the form\u201d who has produced \u201can entertainment, but a smart one, written with a sharp eye and a big heart\u201d. This is a fitting description for this second world war thriller, a gripping story of a novelist handed a top-secret blueprint by a dying man and tasked with getting it into the hands of the French resistance while hounded by the Gestapo. Furst\u2019s writing sometimes verges on the perfunctory \u2013 a possible consequence of his frantic plotting \u2013 but the twists and intrigue keep coming. Jog On Bella Mackie HarperCollins, \u00a38.99, 288pp (paperback) Bella Mackie\u2019s first book, subtitled How Running Saved My Life, is an elegant, uplifting means of discussing her battles with anxiety and depression. Mackie doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the difficulties that led her to start running, or the problems she has faced as a runner \u2013 thankfully, this is not a book in which the writer becomes an ultra-marathon winner. In an accessible fashion, Mackie makes the idea of pulling on trainers and pounding the pavements life-affirming. \u2022 To order Funny Ha Ha, Under Occupation or Jog On go to guardianbookshop.com.
