Now 82, the \"father of African cinema\" this week became the first African director to give the director's lesson at Cannes. But although Semb\u00e8ne, in the footsteps of Bertrand Tavernier, Milos Forman and Wim Wenders, is glad of the accolade, he measures his worth as a filmmaker by his ability to touch audiences in Africa - even if he now travels by truck. \"Europe is not my reference,\" he says. A fisherman, soldier, Marseilles dockworker and communist trade unionist before he turned to fiction in the mid-1950s, Semb\u00e8ne has published 10 books, mainly in French. Most have been translated into English. The epic novel that made his name in 1960, Les Bouts de bois de Dieu (God's Bits of Wood), on the landmark railway workers' strike of 1947-48 in French West Africa, is taught as a classic across the African continent, and is still in print in the Heinemann African Writers Series. He turned to filmmaking after Senegalese independence from France in 1960, appalled by how little impact literature in colonial languages had on fellow Africans. Even today, only 40% of Senegalese are literate. As screenwriter, producer, director and cameo actor, often adapting his own fiction, he has made a dozen features, and more documentaries. Chronicling the lives of the dispossessed, they expose, often with mordant comedy, the inequalities of wealth and power in postcolonial Africa. The artist, he says, must be the \"mouth and ears of his people\", though he favours artistry and open-endedness over didacticism: \"I'm against making poster films.\" \"It's his peripatetic life and eclectic learning that make his work so interesting,\" says the Somali novelist Nuruddin Farah, a friend based in Cape Town. His fiction is \"very simple on the surface, but there's a depth; he uses the novel for a political and social end.\" For the Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who co-directed the documentary Semb\u00e8ne: The Making of African Cinema (1994), his main concern is the \"imperative of social and mental liberation, and of Africa decolonising itself if it's to survive\". Semb\u00e8ne's idea of cinema as \"night school\", and his decision in the late 1960s to make films in indigenous languages rather than French, sparked a revolution in African filmmaking. Filmmakers including Souleymane Ciss\u00e9 of Mali and Haile Gerima of Ethiopia cite him as an inspiration. Fran\u00e7oise Pfaff, professor of French at Howard University, Washington DC, says \"his realist style and politically oriented storylines have left a mark on three generations of filmmakers though his own style has evolved\". For Samba Gadjigo, professor of French at Mount Holyoke college in Massachusetts, who is completing a biography of Semb\u00e8ne, his aim is \"not just to 'see Africa though African eyes', but to create restorative images and a new cinematic language that's rooted in his knowledge of African cultures - not in an African past. We're neither Westerners nor Arabs. His work makes people understand that we need bread and shelter, but without culture there can be no development.\" His latest feature, Moolaad\u00e9, which won last year's Un Certain Regard award at the Cannes film festival and was reviewed in the New York Times as Semb\u00e8ne's \"autumnal masterpiece\", will be released in the UK next month. It coincides with a June retrospective of his work at the National Film Theatre in London, as part of Africa 05. \"For an 82-year-old to continue to make films, particularly in the African environment, is phenomenal,\" says Keith Shiri, director of Africa at the Pictures, a UK promoter. \"His films express shortcomings in African society; he hasn't lost his focus or his passion.\" Filmed in a remote village in the west African state of Burkina Faso, Moolaad\u00e9 traces the ripples of one woman's rebellion against ritual \"purification\" - genital mutilation that is yet to be outlawed in some African countries and, according to the UN, still threatens two million girls each year. \"I was born in a milieu where excision is practised daily and accepted,\" says Semb\u00e8ne. \"But I was also born into an evolving culture, one, like all African cultures, that's acquiring new knowledge.\" Partly from seeing mothers die in childbirth, and Aids infection from dirty knives used in excisions, \"I came to understand that excision was outdated and outmoded\". He chose the village of Djerisso for its unique mosque, which rises like a spiky anthill. Though he says the procedure itself, aimed at subjugating women, predates Islam and is \"as old as humanity\", the film partly satirises elders who trumpet tradition but speak French and worship Allah. New ideas do arrive from outside - men make a bonfire of the rebellious women's radios. But the main force for change is the local tradition of moolaad\u00e9, or sanctuary for the weak. As four little girls seek refuge from the matriarchs' knives in the heroine Coll\u00e9's compound, a traditional cord keeps out both masked women in blood-red cloaks, and male elders in white Islamic robes. \"At a moral level, I don't think we have any lesson to learn from Europe,\" says Semb\u00e8ne, who believes tradition is merely a \"set of habits\", and that \"conservative forces are carried by both men and women\". But there can be no progress in Africa, he has said, \"if women are left out of account\". \"This isn't just entertainment: I call it 'movie school',\" says Semb\u00e8ne, for whom cinema is a \"mirror - so my people can take reponsibility and solve their own problems\". When he showed Moolaad\u00e9 in Burkina Faso, Gabon and Cameroon, \"the debate afterwards was longer than the movie. The taboo is fading.\" Yet the lead actress from Mali, Fatoumata Coulibaly, has had death threats, only partly because of nude scenes deemed contrary to Islam. Though the film was shot in a present-day village of pink mud walls and thatched roofs, with \"no running water or electricity, just mosquitoes\", there is nothing timeless in Semb\u00e8ne's view of Africa, as the film hints at underlying social change. \"When one fruit ripens, others follow suit,\" he says. \"Coll\u00e9 refuses to have her daughter excised but doesn't beat a drum about it. In her silent reaction, like an ocean wave, she carries others with her.\" Semb\u00e8ne lives alone in the Senegalese capital Dakar in a house overlooking the Atlantic that has, he says with satisfaction, no phone. He does business in the city centre offices of his production company, Domirev. According to Breyten Breytenbach, the South African writer who lives on Senegal's Gor\u00e9e Island, he has \"remained unconditionally on the left, and is known to be impervious to patronage\". He travels incessantly, fundraising, scouting for locations, shooting, editing in Tunisia or Morocco and screening. Recently in Manhattan, he had an ovation for Moolaad\u00e9 at the Lincoln Center. In Harlem's \"Little Senegal\" he is recognisable to the francophone clientele of the bistro Les Ambassades with his trademark cap, scarf and pipe. Relaxing over seafood and wine in a friend's apartment, he tunes in religiously to French radio bulletins about Togo's presidential poll. \"He keeps up with everything,\" says Daniel Talbot, president of New Yorker Films, his longtime distributor in the US. \"He's wonderfully well read and very smart.\" In Pfaff's view, he has a \"caustic sense of humour and tremendous vitality: he appears so youthful in body and soul\" - a sprightliness he puts down to yoga. He speaks little English, but Senegalese-accented French, as well as Wolof, Diola, Fulani, Bambara and some Russian. \"Whatever you say, he'll contradict you, even if he agrees,\" says Mahen Bonetti, founding director of New York's African Film Festival. \"He's sly, cunning, playful, witty - he pushes you to think.\" He was born in 1923 in Ziguinchor, on the Casamance river in southern Senegal - then part of French West Africa. His father, Mousse, a fisherman, had migrated from Dakar. His maternal uncle was an Islamic scholar literate in Arabic and French, but he spent most time with his two grandmothers, one a midwife, who \"wielded great authority\". He says, \"I benefited from a synthesis of values - in the house, the compound, the country and Koranic and French schools. We conserved our own culture; we had nightly gatherings with tales. Now I call it my own theatre.\" Aged 13, he was expelled from a colonial school in Casamance for retaliating against a French teacher who had hit him. \"After I slapped the school director on the face, my father said, 'Did you make sure he bled?'\" His father, who vowed never to work for a white man but sold them fish, took him canoe fishing. \"I learned a lot about silence. And the images were important: dawn, and how the river birds make their nests, so you can predict the tides.\" He loved to read. \"Bread came wrapped in French newspapers. Each time my father unwrapped a bagette, he asked me to read to him.\" He left French school in Dakar at 14, and as an apprentice mechanic and bricklayer he indulged his love of cinema. \"When we had a good catch, my father would reward me with change for the movies. I saw and memorised the silent classics - all the films of Charlos [Chaplin].\" Films critical of the colonial presence were banned, says Pfaff, \"but Chaplin was considered harmless\". Yet as Semb\u00e8ne realised, \"Charlos lets no one get away with anything; he returns blow for blow.\" It was Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, about the 1936 Berlin Olympics, that inspired him with Jesse Owens' track victories and the power of cinema. \"Riefenstahl always fascinated me - not the content but the frames,\" he says. Cinemas were segregated. \"Whites sat at the back in armchairs, and natives at the front; some came with their own stools.\" Yet he had no idea of colonialism till the second world war. \"The humiliations had been there on a daily basis. I saw elders with white hair having to doff their hats to white men. I saw it all as a child, but didn't understand.\" Then in 1944 he was called up to serve in the Free French army, as a truck driver in Niger, and in a colonial infantry unit. With his generation, he discovered the irony of helping Nazi-occupied France fight for liberation when that freedom was denied his own people. \"In the army we saw those who considered themselves our masters naked, in tears, some cowardly or ignorant. When a white soldier asked me to write a letter for him, it was a revelation - I thought all Europeans knew how to write. The war demystified the coloniser; the veil fell.\" Demobbed in 1946, he joined a construction union in Dakar, and witnessed the general strike that paralysed the colonial economy for a month and ushered in the fight for independence. \"I learned everything from that human experience,\" he says, noting that \"African strikers sometimes got help from European unions\". Unemployed, he stowed away to Marseilles in 1947, where he worked at the docks and joined France's General Workers' Union. As a French Communist party member from 1950, he travelled widely, and protested against the war in Indochina and French rule in Algeria. He sought to improve the appalling conditions of black workers in Marseilles, but also recalls the warmth of Sunday lunches with French families. His party membership lapsed in 1960, though he claims an affiliation to Marxism \"until my last breath\". After fracturing his spine unloading a ship, and getting a less arduous post, he spent more time in the union library, discovering writers such as Richard Wright, Jack London, Claude McKay of Jamaica and Jacques Roumain of Haiti. Marseilles was then the gateway to France, and like-minded intellectuals would contact him - among them WEB DuBois, James Baldwin, Kwame Nkrumah and George Padmore. \"There weren't disagreements because the only thing that mattered was struggling for independence,\" he says. He wrote poetry for French workers' periodicals. \"It was then mostly Europeans writing about their Africa,\" he recalls. \"It was time for Africa to speak for itself.\" His first novel, Black Docker (1956), about an African dock worker convicted of killing a Frenchwoman after she has passed off his novel manuscript as her own, was partly an allegory of exploitation. But it met with rejections. According to Gadjigo, \"he paid to have it published; his communist friends helped him.\" There were also moves to sideline him, says Gadjigo, \"because he wasn't a typical African writer - he hadn't been to university. There was snobbery, but he never talks about it. He says, 'I don't look back.'\" God's Bits of Wood was his breakthrough. In a strike the French bosses try to starve the railwaymen back to work but women lead a decisive march. It was adapted for the stage in Dakar in 2002, and the Hollywood actor and producer Danny Glover is negotiating for film rights. Semb\u00e8ne returned to independent Senegal in 1960 and sailed up the Congo. \"I wanted to know my continent,\" he says. It was then that he decided to make films, at a time when cold war adversaries were competing with scholarships. He studied at the Gorky Studios in Moscow, returning to Senegal a year later with an old Soviet camera. His short black-and-white film Borom Sarret (1963), the first film made in the region by a sub-Saharan African, followed a day in the life of a Dakar cart driver. Niaye (1964), based on a short story, broached the taboo of incest, while La Noire de ... (Black Girl, 1966), the region's first full-length feature, was sparked by a news story about a Senegalese maid brought to the French Riviera who kills herself. Her voiceover reveals that, though her country is supposedly free, she remains a possession. Talbot, who met Semb\u00e8ne in Paris in the late 1960s, says, \"I was devastated -I'd never seen that kind of cinema before. The stories are simple but artistic and powerful, and suffused with humanity. They're classics.\" They coincided with independence, says Shiri, \"showing there were still problems that needed to be addressed, and that cinema was the best medium for it.\" Semb\u00e8ne admits influences ranging from Italian 1940s neo-realism - notably Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves - and Eisenstein, to the French 1950s Nouvelle Vague and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. He also drew on African oral tales, and used folkloric types, such as tricksters. He sees the African artist as a modern-day griot, a bard who is also a licensed fool. \"The griot was an honest eye witness and messenger; the only one able to speak the truth and to humiliate the leader. He was immune to power. But now we have a new breed of griot who's a mouthpiece for the powerful; he's just there to sing their praises and get paid.\" Semb\u00e8ne co-founded Kaddu, a newspaper in Wolof in the 1970s, and began to make films in Wolof or Diola. \"No language is better than any other,\" he says. In Mandabi (1968), based on his 1966 novel Le Mandat (The Money Order), an illiterate Dakar resident receives a windfall from his nephew, a street-sweeper in Paris, but in trying to cash the order becomes entangled with the callous bureaucracy of Senegal's new elite. Another of his best-known films, Xala (1974), satirises a new bourgeoisie who wash their Mercedes in Evian, through the tale of a polygamous businessman struck down by impotence, and the procession of beggars who spit on him to end the curse. No African director, the Guardian's film critic Derek Malcolm wrote, \"has criticised the pretensions and corruption of its rulers more severely, or with such quiet hilarity\". His films put him at loggerheads with Senegal's government. One actor in Xala was chosen for his resemblance to President L\u00e9opold Senghor, a poet and exponent of Negritude, the francophone-led movement for black cultural pride, with which Semb\u00e8ne took issue. For Semb\u00e8ne, says Gadjigo, \"the main issue was not skin colour but class. He thinks cultural alienation is a problem only for African intellectuals, and that the real problem is Africa's economic exploitation.\" For Semb\u00e8ne, Negritude was a \"stage in the history of Africa, but all the fuss was a fuss between intellectuals.\" When the authorities made a dozen cuts to Xala before it was screened in Dakar, he distributed leaflets in protest. \"All ideologies practise censorship one way or another,\" he says. \"But I don't know how to be oblique - I say things the way I see them.\" His work often lampoons polygamists, and he says his own father was \"never polygamous; he divorced and remarried\". Though reticent about his own relationships with women, Semb\u00e8ne is twice divorced. According to his biographer, he was married in 1962 to a cousin, a midwife, and divorced in 1974. That year he began a 12-year marriage to an African-American doctoral student who had come to interview him. Though Gadjigo says Semb\u00e8ne has no children from his marriages, he has a son Alain, aged 48, a civil engineer in Marseilles, from a relationship in France in the 1950s, and two younger sons: Moussa, aged 32, a department store worker and aspiring DJ in New Orleans; and Matar, aged 16, who is still at school in Dakar. He has one granddaughter. Breytenbach describes him as a \"very good father, with a very natural relationship with his sons\". Semb\u00e8ne says they all visit during holidays, though none has followed in his footsteps: \"They're not crazy.\" Semb\u00e8ne turned to history, making Emita\u00ef (1971), about a Senegalese rebellion against forced conscription in the second world war. Ceddo (1976), set partly in the 19th century, shows a people trying to preserve its culture from the onslaught of Islam, Christianity and the slave trade - in which Africans are seen to be complicit. Semb\u00e8ne, says Gadjigo, was \"not attacking Islam but the way it was used by the ruling powers\". Senghor banned the film on the pretext that the title misspelled the word for commoners. It was not screened in Senegal until after his resignation in 1980. Now Senegalese rap musicians sample the Cameroonian Manu Dibango's music from the film, \"and they're even more stinging in their criticisms of the ruling powers than me\", Semb\u00e8ne says approvingly. Camp de Thiaroye (1988) exposed a French massacre of African soldiers, who were returning from the second world war, to quell a 1944 mutiny sparked by attempts to cheat veterans out of severance pay. \"Months before the end of the war, the French army was killing people who'd participated in France's liberation,\" says Semb\u00e8ne. \"That's part of my legacy I shouldn't forget. I have to erect a monument to it.\" But in Gadjigo's view, \"it's a hidden page of history the French would rather bury. Camp de Thiaroye wasn't seen in France till the late 1990s.\" Semb\u00e8ne has always been uncomfortable with French sponsorship and patronage, though what is known as African cinema, Shiri points out, \"was born out of France's desire to retain cultural influence in the continent\", through subsidies to officially approved films. Semb\u00e8ne increasingly taps EU coffers. \"I go everywhere, knock on all doors,\" he says. According to Talbot, he has \"always been in total financial control of his work; he has all his negatives.\" For Semb\u00e8ne, \"Africa is my audience; the west and the rest are markets.\" But he feels the chronic distribution problem in Africa (where many commercial cinemas offer a diet of Bollywood and kung fu) has \"gone backwards not forwards, especially in francophone countries\". Outside festivals, Gadjigo says, \"it is hard to see African films in Africa. African leaderships don't see the role cinema can play in development,\" and 90% of Senegalese cinemas have closed in the past 10 years. Shiri notes that under IMF belt-tightening in the 1980s and 90s, \"governments weren't given any leeway to support culture\". Though Semb\u00e8ne tries to premiere his films in Senegal through private screenings, he rejects the fleapit urban cinemas. Mamadou Niang, a Senegalese friend and producer for France Television in New York, says \"his refusal to have his movies shown in towns since the nineties is a slap in the face of the political elite, who he thinks don't care about culture\". He has rarely allowed his films to be released on video. But next month New Yorker Films releases his first DVDs, Xala and Mandabi, with the rest to follow. \"I'm confident one day we'll be able to see our films in Africa,\" he says. Semb\u00e8ne is proud that Moolaad\u00e9 was \"born on the continent and from the continent\". In Gadjigo's view, \"by making films with Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, C\u00f4te D'Ivoire, he's symbolically creating a unity that political leaders haven't been able to achieve\". The pernicious effect of dependence on outside aid is a theme of Guelwaar (1992), a film based on a true story, in which a Christian leader's erroneous burial in a Muslim cemetery creates chaos as fellow Christians try to recover the corpse. Faat Kin\u00e9 (2000), the first of a trilogy on \"daily heroism\" of which Moolaad\u00e9 forms the second part, follows the life of a single mother running a petrol station in Dakar. He tries to alternate rural with urban settings. \"I see people surviving from day to day in my country in a very honest way; that inspires me,\" Semb\u00e8ne says. Senghor died in 2001, and Semb\u00e8ne pronounces him a \"great poet in the French language, but a poor politician\". In 2000 presidential elections, Abdoulaye Wade finally ended the 20-year rule of Senghor's successor, Abdou Diouf. Yet for Semb\u00e8ne, \"I don't think liberalism is a way to govern Africa, because we're going to continue being the beggars of Europe.\" Last year's screening at Cannes was attended by Senegal's first lady, Viviane Wade. \"It would be a very courageous act for this government to participate in the development of cinema,\" says Semb\u00e8ne with a sigh. He had hoped to shoot the last film of his trilogy, Brotherhood of Rats, in the presidential palace, but the authorities were rumoured to have refused after learning that its target is corruption. Many of his screenplays are based on anecdotes of everyday life. \"I'm almost a patriarch: I have a lot of nephews and nieces, who serve me as an observatory, telling me lots of stories.\" Now, he adds, \"There's a new Africa being born that will only materialise through struggle. That will depend on Africans taking responsibility.\" According to Farah, Semb\u00e8ne has a \"long view of history, and the patience to wait for things to mature\". He has aspirations to make a film on Samori, the 19th-century leader who resisted French rule and was portrayed by the colonisers as a barbarian. \"Every country creates its images,\" he has said. \"We don't have to erase them. History will do it for us.\" Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne Born: January 1 1923 Casamance, Senegal, French West Africa.
