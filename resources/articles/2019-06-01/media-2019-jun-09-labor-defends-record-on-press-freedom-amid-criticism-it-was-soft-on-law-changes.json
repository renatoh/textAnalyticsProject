Labor has defended its role in helping to pass national security legislation which curtailed media freedoms and protections for whistleblowers in the past two terms of Coalition government, with the opposition sensitive to any criticism it was \u201csoft\u201d on the issue. But Richard Marles said Labor consistently attempted to add safeguards to the government\u2019s legislation, to ensure public interest journalism and those who contributed to it were protected, adding the government was distancing itself from the \u201cextraordinary\u201d scenes of last week. \u201cAt every moment along the way, we have been the proponents and responsible for amendments which go to the question of there being national interest tests which protect the freedom of the press,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s actually our form over the last few years. We will have a look at whatever the government put before us in terms of propositions here. But the starting point is they\u2019ve actually got to come out and make it clear that, as a government, they support the idea of the freedom of the press. And right now, we haven\u2019t even heard that. Marles defended Mark Dreyfus, in his role of shadow attorney general, writing to the government demanding an investigation into the leak which formed the basis of Smethurst\u2019s story, as \u201cpointing out the chaos of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government and the fact they were leaking like a sieve\u201d. \u201cAnd they needed to get their house in order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that the remedy of that is to then go and shake down a press gallery with the federal police is ridiculous. The government needs to get its house in order in terms of how it manages information. That\u2019s not a question then about stopping the media from doing its job, and that completely crosses the line.\u201d Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have both distanced themselves from the AFP raids, which saw the News Corp Sundays political editor, Annika Smethurst, targeted at her home for stories she wrote more than a year ago, and the ABC raided over a story from two years ago, for which an alleged whistleblower has already been charged. In the days following the raids, it was revealed the AFP advised it was not looking for conversations which involved politicians while Smethurst\u2019s home was raided, while the AFP also acknowledged it had dropped the investigation into the politically advantageous leak into security agency advice into the medevac laws the Coalition opposed. The final Senate makeup is yet to be decided, but the Centre Aliance senator Rex Patrick said if, as expected, his party\u2019s two votes form part of the balance of power, he would expect further protections for media freedom to be seriously considered. Speaking to Sky News, Patrick, who has previously argued for more protection for whistleblowers, said a free media should form part of Australia\u2019s constitution. The first amendment of the US constitution protects both freedom of speech and the media and has stood as an inalienable defence against attempts to discourage journalists from investigating those in power. \u201cRather than perhaps go back and adjust every single one of [the laws], if we had, as we should have, a provision in our constitution that protects freedom of the press, it would change the lens through which those laws were interpreted and, indeed, may make some of them completely invalid,\u201d he told Sky News. Any changes to the constitution require a referendum. Patrick said he believed the issue to be \u201curgent and pressing\u201d and worth consideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
