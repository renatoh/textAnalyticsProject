It was the manner of the defeat - their second in four games - as much as the fact of losing which suggested as much. The batting was fragile and the bowling - Mushtaq Ahmed and Rana Naved included - lacked penetration, and even the fielding did not look particularly sharp. As so often this season the Sussex innings faltered from the start. Stuart Clark made the initial breakthrough. Having beaten Chris Nash for pace with a sharp bouncer, the Australian Test bowler's next delivery was pitched up and moved back off the seam to beat a tentative forward defensive shot by Nash, hitting middle stump. Luke Wright, determined to be positive, then clipped Clark high over midwicket to get off the mark, but an attempt to repeat the shot against Dimitri Mascarenhas was skied to John Crawley, and when Chris Adams, having avoided three consecutive short balls from Clark, gloved the fourth gently to Nic Pothas, Sussex were 18 for three in the ninth over. Richard Montgomerie and Murray Goodwin set about repairing the damage, and were beginning to do so when Goodwin edged a catch behind off a Shane Warne delivery. Carl Hopkinson gave Warne the charge but succeeded only in getting himself stumped. Montgomerie found a more reliable partner in Andrew Hodd, making his competition debut. The young wicketkeeper was on 29 when he made room to drive Sean Ervine and was smartly stumped by Pothas, standing up to the medium-pacer. Robin Martin-Jenkins, having flailed away at Warne without success, was trapped in front by the spinner's shooter. But Naved hit out with rather more success, clobbering Ervine for 20 off four deliveries before missing the fifth, a slower ball. Montgomerie finally ran himself out in the last over, his 89 taking his aggregate in this competition to an impressive 341. Unless there was more in the wicket than had been apparent to those watching, a total of 201 offered little room for Adams to manoeuvre. And though John Crawley's tame dismissal, driving his fifth ball from Mushtaq straight back to the bowler, left Hampshire on 80 for three, Ervine and Michael Lumb played sensibly to add 82 for the fourth wicket, effectively making the game safe. Lumb's dismissal for 66, attempting a head-up slog at Nash after reaching his best score for his new county, will not have pleased Warne, who may just have had a quiet word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
