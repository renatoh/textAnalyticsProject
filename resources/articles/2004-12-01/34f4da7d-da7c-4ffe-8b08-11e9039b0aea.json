These are files for a coming release from Service Integrity, a company based in Newton, Massachusetts, selling software that helps businesses mine their data for customer leads. Each file highlighted in a bright color represents a match with known \"open-source\" code covered by a license. And each match represents a potential problem that Service Integrity must resolve. Similar scenes are playing out at many U.S. software companies and other businesses as engineers frantically search their files for something they hope not to find: open-source components."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
