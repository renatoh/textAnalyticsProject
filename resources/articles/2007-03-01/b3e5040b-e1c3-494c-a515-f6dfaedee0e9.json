The decision was criticised by the British government last night as \"regrettable\". It comes amid a widening gap between the two countries over the future sovereignty of the islands. The Argentinian foreign minister, Jorge Taiana, yesterday announced that his country would end its involvement in the joint declaration of September 27 1995 on cooperation over offshore activities in the south-west Atlantic. Mr Taiana described the declaration as \"an instrument the United Kingdom sought to use to justify its illegitimate and unilateral action to explore for resources that belong to the Argentinian citizens.\" The move comes just before the 25th anniversary of April 2 1982, when Argentinian troops landed in the Falklands. This led to the 10-week conflict in which about 700 Argentinian and 255 British troops died. Although there has been no hint of armed conflict since, tensions have been growing between the two countries over the sovereignty of the islands, which the United Kingdom claims is an issue that can only be resolved with the agreement of the islanders, who number around 3,000. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said last night that the government regretted Argentina's decision to withdraw from the joint declaration. An FCO spokesperson said: \"This is a backward step. Although there has been little joint activity under the 1995 joint declaration for a number of years, the declaration was designed to enable cooperation on practical issues of mutual benefit in the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources. \"The Argentine action will make any future cooperation in this area more difficult. This regrettable action will not in any way help Argentina in its claim for sovereignty of the Islands.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
