The goals keep coming, the points are still flowing and there is rarely a dull moment when they are around. Here, for 45 minutes, they were a pale shadow of the team who have performed beyond expectation this season, second best in all areas of the pitch to a Sheffield United side splendidly led by Rob Hulse, and consequently staring at defeat. But what a transformation. Rather than read the riot act during the interval, Redknapp got to grips with a few basics and his players came out to deliver all the missing composure and conviction for a clear-cut victory. 'I just told them to bring the ball down, play it in to the front pair and not get sucked in to playing it long towards their two central defenders,' he said. 'They showed terrific character to turn things round. Thirty-two points at this stage of the season is a fantastic achievement. We just have to keep picking up the points - and keeping fit.' For United, it was the end of a productive spell of 10 points from four matches, which has revitalised their season. Neil Warnock felt some of their football was the best they have produced away from home - but once again the manager had a grumble about refereeing decisions that he felt proved costly. His target was Graham Poll and what he claimed was an incorrect decision to award Portsmouth the corner from which Sol Campbell headed his first goal for the club. Warnock also maintained that his defender Chris Morgan was blocked off from making a challenge as Campbell headed in Matthew Taylor's inswinging corner. 'I've got to bite my tongue, otherwise I will be fined,' he said. 'We have had Graham twice this season and I hope this is the last time.' Warnock did admit, however, that his players should have been capable of coping with a manoeuvre with which they are familiar. United also lacked effective marking when Noe Pamarot sealed the points. Before kick-off, David James was presented with Portsmouth's Player of the Month award for November. In fact, his first touch was to pick the ball out of the net when, from six yards, Hulse headed home the angled cross Derek Geary directed over Campbell, after Stephen Quinn had turned the ball back. United should have gone two up when Danny Webber galloped through after Sean Davis failed to clear, but he pulled his shot wide of the far upright. The miss was costly. Within two minutes of the restart Benjani Mwaruwari got behind the defence and his low centre was deflected over the line by Phil Jagielka, before Rob Kozluk's attempted clearance confirmed the own goal. Suddenly Portsmouth were alive and United found themselves under siege. Campbell struck, then Glen Johnson launched into a run at the defence that looked likely to bring a third until his shot on the run sailed over. But it was not long in coming. A corner from Pedro Mendes found its way through to Pamarot, who followed up his goal against Arsenal a week earlier by heading in. Mwaruwari hammered one not far wide from 20 yards and his side seemed to have a genuine claim for a penalty when Davis was brought down. Warnock used all of his three substitutes in a four-minute spell, but Portsmouth's supremacy was now so deep-rooted that they made little difference. Man of the match: Pedro Mendes Heavily involved in Portsmouth's second half recovery. Earlier, they had been second best in the middle of the field, but when the Portugal midfielder began to drive his team forward, they found a fluency that turned the match on its head. He capped his display by providing the corner for Pompey's third goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
