The British version of the magazine turned 100, resulting in, among other celebratory goings-on, an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery, Vogue 100: A Century of Style, telling the story of one of the world\u2019s most influential magazines. But a turn of events, and the social media reaction, threw a stiletto at the brand\u2019s well-manicured public appearance and demonstrated very publicly an insurgency that is under way next to the catwalk. During a round-table discussion about Milan fashion week, editors on Vogue\u2019s American edition gave their views on style bloggers, and it was damning. Questioning the street-style business model of wearing paid-for brand placements, they used descriptors like \u201cdesperate\u201d and said it \u201cherald(ed) the death of style\u201d. In response, style blogger Susie Bubble tweeted: \u201cThe fashion establishment don\u2019t want their circles enlarged and for the ivory tower to remain just that. Towering and impenetrable.\u201d The incident highlighted how the ground beneath the establishment\u2019s feet has shifted this season. See-now-buy-now and genderless catwalks have reflected economic and social shifts towards a younger mindset, while Bubble\u2019s point about enlarging circles could equally read as a comment on what\u2019s been happening on the front row (the \u201cFrow\u201d) in this summer\u2019s global fashion shows. Traditionally the place where old Hollywood glamour mixed with fashion journalism, the Frow has shifted its allegiances, actively courting a younger and more social media-savvy crowd. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s Milan fashion week show was an extreme example of this. It saw the fashion house fly in a range of millennial celebrities, such as Cameron Dallas, Lily-Rose Depp, Lucky Blue Smith and Rafferty Law, to sit in pride of place. The Frow resembled a particularly large group selfie, where mainstream media journalists were relegated to the second row. Meanwhile, the kitschy, high-energy presentation featured street dancers, model Hailey Baldwin and a pre-show soundtrack of Justin Bieber, pointed attempts to capture not just hearts and minds but the smartphone\u2019s lens too. As the show came to a close, exiting fashionistas, such as Anna Wintour, were met by swarms of pre-pubescent girls screaming not for her but for the heart-throbs they follow on Vine or Instagram. It was Beatlemania for Generation Z. Backstage before the show, Stefano Gabbana admitted that the label was trying to appeal to a younger market. \u201cWe looked at the millennials [for inspiration],\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to be young.\u201d The appeal to fashion labels is clear: a Frow full of social media-savvy celebs creates publicity and generates sales. \u201cVloggers, Viners and Instagram celebs almost exist for endorsements,\u201d says Malcolm Mackenzie, editor of We Love Pop magazine. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a day job, like shooting a movie, to get in the way of self-promotion, because self-promotion is their day job.\u201d But arranging the seating plan of the Frow can be a tricky jigsaw to solve. \u201cMy feeling is that it\u2019s always a balance \u2013 you want heavy-hitter celebrities, but the editors are just as vital with huge followings, too,\u201d says Mandi Lennard, fashion PR and consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance, as you don\u2019t want to make an editor feel neglected.\u201d But perhaps editors just need to adapt to the times: 2016 has seen the fashion industry focus on young celebrities who fit the Hailey Baldwin template: heritage names with large social media followings. \u201cStars like Dallas have a direct line to millions of fans who avidly watch everything they do, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for business to want in on the action,\u201d says Mackenzie. Things can only get younger.
