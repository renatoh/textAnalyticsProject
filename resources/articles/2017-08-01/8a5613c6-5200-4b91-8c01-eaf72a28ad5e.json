S\u00e1nchez is likely to depart without a fee unless a new contract is agreed with the club \u2013 a situation that Wenger said has not progressed. There has been interest in the forward from a number of other clubs in pre-season but the Arsenal manager has weighed up the pros and cons of retaining him and resolved that the football benefits he brings outweigh any potential transfer fee. \u201cAt the moment no, because we have not progressed on that front,\u201d Wenger said when asked whether S\u00e1nchez will sign a new deal. \u201cHe is a player who goes into the final year of his contract and prepares for the season.\u201d Pressed on whether that means he is willing to let the Chile international depart for nothing, Wenger continued: \u201cThat is a consequence of what I say, yes, unfortunately. But we have to make a choice between efficiency on the field and financial interest, and most of the time if you can find a good compromise it\u2019s better. But in this case, I think I prioritise the fact that he will be useful on the sporting side.\u201d He said it was not a perfect state of affairs but left the door open for S\u00e1nchez to sign a contract that has been on the table since last season. \u201cLook, let\u2019s not be wrong, it\u2019s not an ideal situation on the financial side and it demands some sacrifice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first of all it doesn\u2019t mean the players who are in the final year of their contract will not extend their contract. You have still that possibility and we work on that as well.\u201d Wenger, who also explained that he supports the proposed early closure of future Premier League transfer windows, underlined that the decision not to let S\u00e1nchez leave was taken by him rather than Arsenal\u2019s board. \u201cIt\u2019s my decision, but after the board has to, of course, agree with me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t agree we have to consider it as well, and I will accept it. But the board is behind me on that.\u201d He accepted, though, that the potential gains and losses involved with keeping S\u00e1nchez are impossible to calculate precisely and that such situations tend to be unique to the club in question. \u201cYou cannot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have an estimation of what it costs if you lose the player, what it costs if you extend the player [\u2019s contract], what it costs if you buy a new player. You can do that, approximately. After that, the ratio between what the player will cost and what he brings back, this has gone. \u201cHow can you quantify today what Neymar costs? Will he bring \u20ac300m back [to Paris Saint-Germain]? It\u2019s impossible to say. There is a part that is rational, and the other part is completely irrational: it is passion, ego, pride, you can call that how you want. How much is that worth financially? Maybe that\u2019s down to every club.\u201d Mesut \u00d6zil will also be out of contract at the end of the season, and Wenger said he remains \u201coptimistic\u201d that both he and S\u00e1nchez will eventually agree new terms \u2013 implying that this may be easier to arrange if the team is performing well. \u201cLook, both players are happy at the club,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, for me, after that you have to meet their needs. Their needs are their desire for success and their needs are as well financial. I think if we can meet their needs on the pitch, there is more chance to extend their contracts.\u201d Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another player to have been linked with a move away from Arsenal but Wenger expects the midfielder to join S\u00e1nchez and \u00d6zil in remaining at the club, although he said \u201c100% [certainty] in our job never exists\u201d when asked whether all three would definitely stay. Wenger also confirmed he wants midfielder Jack Wilshere, who is returning to fitness after a leg fracture, to stay at Arsenal this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
