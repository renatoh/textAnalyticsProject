There was no danger of Roman Abramovich drifting off as he watched Frank Lampard\u2019s gifted forwards rack up the goals in southern Russia. After stodgy stalemates with Sevilla and Manchester United, defensive stability accompanied attacking flair, helped by Hakim Ziyech marking his first start by leaving Krasnodar\u2019s back four dizzy. Ziyech was outstanding on the right wing, creating, probing and making it 3-0 after a slick combination with Timo Werner, another glamorous summer signing. For Abramovich, watching first hand what his funds have bought, it was a night to savour. As for Lampard, it was a glimpse of where the pieces might fall after receiving heavy backing from Chelsea\u2019s owner, who was present to see his club in the flesh for the first time in more than a year. The challenge for Lampard remains finding the right blend after spending on attacking reinforcements in the summer. Chelsea\u2019s manager has more options than last season but that brings new headaches. How does he keep everyone happy? The trip to Krasnodar, who were weighed down by nine injuries, offered a chance to experiment. Callum Hudson-Odoi came in for a rare start on the left wing and calmed Chelsea\u2019s nerves with the opener after being set up by Kai Havertz, the \u00a362m signing from Bayer Leverkusen. Later on, with Krasnodar ragged, there were goals for Werner, Ziyech and Christian Pulisic, who shone after coming off the bench. Chelsea, who have four points from their first two games in Group E, had displayed their potential. Yet it was not the perfect display. There were a few wobbles at time, including an early penalty miss from Jorginho, and Krasnodar will rue hitting the bar when they trailed 1-0. All the same Lampard was entitled to feel positive. A third consecutive clean sheet came with Thiago Silva resting at home and Antonio R\u00fcdiger doing well after being restored in central defence. All things considered, Abramovich picked a good moment to have a look at a Lampard side in competitive action for the first time. \u201cI always feel the support of the owner,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cTo have him here is a nice bonus. I didn\u2019t manage to see him because before the game I was in the dressing room. I\u2019m very pleased we put on what I thought was a good performance.\u201d Perhaps it was understandable that Chelsea took a while to adjust to the unusual sight of fans inside the ground. It felt like a mental challenge for a team who have been playing Premier League games in empty arenas since June and there were moments when they looked thrown by reminders of the old normal. A slow tempo allowed Krasnodar to maintain a solid shape and a lack of urgency on the ball came with risks, not least when Havertz dithered after four minutes, allowing Daniil Utkin to force Mendy to make a plunging save. Perhaps it is a stylistic issue with Havertz, a languid talent. On the one hand the mistake that led to Utkin\u2019s chance brought to mind Havertz running into trouble and gifting a goal to Danny Ings in Chelsea\u2019s 3-3 draw with Southampton. Yet it was hard to be overly critical of the German attacker after he drifted into space to create Hudson-Odoi\u2019s goal. It was a big moment for Hudson-Odoi. Under pressure to impress, the youngster provided the ruthlessness, shifting the ball on to his right foot before getting slightly lucky with a shot that squirmed underneath Matvei Safonov, Krasnodar\u2019s 21-year-old goalkeeper. Lampard praised Hudson-Odoi and Ziyech, who was full of urgency after recovering from a knee injury. The former Ajax winger demonstrated his ability to carve open a defence in the 13th minute, releasing C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, whose pass to Werner led to Kaio conceding a penalty. Abramovich, who took up Israeli citizenship after withdrawing his application for a new UK visa in 2018, prepared to celebrate as he took in his first live Chelsea game since a friendly against RB Salzburg in the summer of 2019. Jorginho went through his usual penalty routine, hopping, skipping, waiting for the goalkeeper to move first. Safonov went the wrong way. He escaped when the ball hit the opposite post. Profligacy from Jorginho, who also missed a penalty against Liverpool last month, led to a sloppy spell. Krasnodar stuck at it. The depleted hosts almost equalised when Yuri Gazinsky hit the bar. Chelsea woke up after that scare and restored order after introducing N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Mason Mount and Pulisic, who won another penalty after his shot was handled by Aleksandr Martynovich. This time Werner slammed the ball home. Soon Werner found Ziyech, wriggling into space before finishing calmly. Abramovich was a happy man, even more so when Pulisic added a fourth in added time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
