Planned Parenthood was forced on the defensive after the release of the first of three undercover videos two weeks ago showed an official with the organization discussing the legal but controversial practice of donating fetal tissue for medical research. The organization has forcefully and repeatedly denied that it profits from the practice, saying the videos have been heavily edited and taken out of context. On Tuesday, the Center for Medical Progress, the previously obscure group behind the attacks, released a third video that includes graphic footage \u2013 obtained surreptitiously \u2013 of a lab technician separating tissue collected from an aborted fetus. \u201cThis video really shows such extremely disturbing violations of patient privacy and dignity,\u201d Dawn Laguens, executive vice-president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told reporters during a conference call on Tuesday. Coinciding with the newest video\u2019s release, anti-abortion activists staged \u201cwomen betrayed\u201d rallies in dozens of cities around the country to protest the organization. At the US Capitol in Washington, protesters were joined by Republican presidential contenders Ben Carson and Rand Paul, along with several other anti-abortion politicians. During the rally, Paul announced that he had secured a commitment in the Senate to vote on a bill that would defund the organization before Congress recesses. Republicans face an uphill battle to secure the 60 of 100 senate votes needed to approve the bill \u2013 there are 54 Republicans in the Senate and only a handful of anti-abortion Democrats. Republican lawmakers have also called on the the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to investigate claims that the organization broke the law by selling fetal tissue, as the Center for Medical Progress asserts. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and its constellation of political allies are doubling down on their defense of the nearly 100-year-old organization, as it becomes clear Republicans aren\u2019t letting the issue fade. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous, not to mention wildly unpopular, that politicians are using this widely discredited attack against Planned Parenthood to push through legislation rolling back women\u2019s access to healthcare,\u201d Laguens said. The overwhelming majority of federal funding the organization receives consists of reimbursement for Medicaid visits, the organization said in a statement. Moreover, it said, 90% of services Planned Parenthood provides are for preventive health. The organization noted that federal law already withholds funding for abortion and therefore defunding the organization would in effect hurt its ability to provide preventative health services such as sex education and breast cancer research. During the conference call, Planned Parenthood unveiled the results of a new poll, conducted by Hart Research, that found 63% of voters don\u2019t support congressional efforts to defund the organization. The poll also found that voters were more likely to vote for a candidate who supported funding the organization than one who has called for it to be defunded, by a margin of 58% to 26%. \u201cThe bottom line here from all of this research is that Americans continue to support funding for Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Geoff Garin, president of Hart Research, on the call. The poll surveyed 800 registered voters, and was conducted after the release of the first two videos; it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Videos made from undercover footage The videos were filmed over the course of 30 months in an effort to document \u201chow Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted babies\u201d, the Center for Medical Progress said in releasing them. Its activists, posing as representatives from a \u201cfetal tissue procurement company\u201d, surreptitiously filmed one official detailing how to abort a fetus to preserve its organs and a second official discussing prices for specimens. The latest video includes undercover footage of a physician \u2013 identified as Dr Savita Ginde, the vice-president and medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado \u2013 discussing fetal tissue procurement with an activist disguised as a buyer while they observe specimens in a laboratory. It also includes an interview with a former procurement technician who says she used to work for Stem Express, in a Planned Parenthood clinic. The woman, Holly O\u2019Donnell, describes her discomfort with the work and said she \u201cblacked out\u201d the first time she picked up a specimen. \u201cI thought I was going to be just drawing blood, not procuring tissue from aborted fetuses,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. David Daleiden, the Center for Medical Progress\u2019s head, has said there are several more videos to be released soon, in addition to between 100 and 200 pages of documents from Planned Parenthood and its \u201cproxies\u201d. In addition to the videos, Planned Parenthood is dealing with a possible data breach. The group said on Monday it had notified the FBI and the Department of Justice that hackers had attempted to gain access to the abortion provider\u2019s employee information systems. The potential data breach appears to have been first reported by the Daily Dot on Monday. The report cited a hacker group called \u201c3301\u201d taking responsibility for the attack, which has yet to be officially confirmed. The hacker group told the news site that the cyber-attack was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Laguens, of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the undercover videos took the organization by surprise, calling the \u201clevel of deviousness\u201d required to sustain the ruse \u201cunprecedented in its scale\u201d. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t know until the first video was released,\u201d Laguens said. Since then, Planned Parenthood has been working to both put out the political fire and improve its firewall, to avoid such breaches in the future. \u201cWe have tons of people working on this and I feel confident that we\u2019re taking every step possible.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
