But Arsenal's 4-0 victory at Tranmere in midweek meant that the Belles' letter of congratulation reached London N5 before they did. Tranmere applauded the winners off the pitch, the girls got back on the coach, notified Arsenal's vice-chairman David Dein, opened the two magnums of champagne kindly donated by Messrs Vieira and Keown and turned up the radio. The motorway services just south of Chester must have seemed a funny place to end up within an hour of winning the treble. Highbury had been booked for the occasion yesterday, flyers distributed, the pitch thoroughly watered. Belles would have appreciated the attention to detail: at their place they run out to music and reward the woman of the match with their own-label champagne - although who the grapes belong to is another matter. Much mud has been raked over since last week's cup final win over Fulham: in particular, the variety bobbling the Selhurst Park surface that Arsenal blamed for their scrappy showing. For the champions, here was a chance to argue their true style on a \"proper\" pitch. If the world had not seen the real Arsenal last week, it did not get to see them yesterday either, but this time it was not the football missing. The crowd was 400 - far less than the near 14,000 on Monday. However it still dwarfed the turnout at Tranmere, where the treble was completed on Thursday night. Doncaster, meanwhile, could only hope to raise a digit in their rivals' unimpeachable defeats' column. Valiant, though less artful, they could not match the champions for fluency and vision. They lost 2-1 and can thank the woodwork for preserving quite so much dignity. Meanwhile, the view is bleaker than a stop-off on a motorway for Millwall , whose 3-0 home defeat to Sunderland leaves them clinging on, although the winners are safe. Southampton, a point from safety, are the only other side who can be caught despite beating Liverpool 4-2. Finally, mid-table Charlton and Barry Town fought out a 1-1 draw. One team which does know how to celebrate are Leeds , whose 5-0 victory at Wolves in the week made them Northern Division champions - 12 bottles of champagne and an early-morning curry. Perhaps the restaurant concerned might consider rewarding patronage with sponsorship: Leeds are currently wearing special shirts, blank on the front."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
