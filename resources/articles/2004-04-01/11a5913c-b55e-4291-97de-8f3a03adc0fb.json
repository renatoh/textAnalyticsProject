But it seems to me that of all the prominent men and women of the past few years, with the possible exceptions of Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi, one more exempt than most from such scrutiny is Vaclav Havel, former president of the Czech Republic. I have been unable to find any reference to him being someone who does crosswords, but I was browsing in one of his books - Disturbing the Peace - at the weekend, and it seemed to me he just might. \"Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism,\" he said in 1986. \"It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the conviction that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.\" Well! A solver's charter if ever I read one, and the sort of thing one needs to bear very much in mind when settling down to a puzzle by, say, Enigmatist. Actually, I tried the Enigmatist puzzle last Saturday with a conspicuous lack of success, but I retain my conviction that it will - when the solution is published - all make sense. Bunthorne on Tuesday was better - which is to say I could do most of it: \"Politician and dramatist have left following holiday, carrying the can (6,5).\"* It is now more than a year since Havel exited, stage left, from the frontline of Czech politics. At home - as is so often the case - his reputation is more mixed than it is abroad. The Czech right, for example, despise him for \"losing\" Slovakia and others condemned him for his fondness for holding meetings in pubs. The drink never got him, but cancer nearly did, for he is many things, but never a puritan. And even if he doesn't do crosswords, I am sure that he would understand what Araucaria meant on Wednesday: \"Devoted to health, no? Word is, antiphlogistine will be needed (3,4,2,4,2,5,4,4,10).\" Do not lose hope. It all makes sense ... * VACLAV HAVEL, THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS \u00b7 Sandy Balfour is the author of Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8), published by Atlantic Books \ufffd Sandy Balfour 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
