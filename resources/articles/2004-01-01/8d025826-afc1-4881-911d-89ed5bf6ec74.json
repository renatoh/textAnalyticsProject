His influence in helping to steer Stoke away from the bottom was again underlined when he scored the goal that gave them their 2-1 win at home to Derby County . It was his second goal for the club, but even more important to Stoke has been the extent to which he has improved their defence. In a run that has seen them drop only two points in his six matches - and rise from third bottom to mid-table - they have had to pick the ball out of their net only three times. It happened after just a minute against Derby, with Lee Morris ideally placed to apply the finishing touch to a deflection. But Ade Akinbiyi capitalised on an error by Derby defender Michael Johnson to equalise and County - who wasted excellent chances to regain the lead - were sunk by a Taggart header. Derby were not the only team in the bottom six who failed to do what Bradford City (see report left) did, that is win away from home. Nottingham Forest , who like Bradford were also facing a team at the other end of the table - Sunderland - lost 1-0 and Wimbledon fell by the same score at Crewe Alexandra . Watford and Burnley had to settle for goalless draws at Coventry City and Crystal Palace respectively. Wimbledon, now five points adrift at the bottom, should have done better. That they did not do so was due to a combination of poor finishing, an excellent display by Crewe goalkeeper Clayton Ince and the header that brought Steve Jones his eighth goal in ten matches. Forest, who slipped into fourth bottom, could have no complaints about their result. Sunderland, whose goal came from a superb 25-yard shot from their Argentine left-back Julio Arca, could easily have increased their lead - although they came close to being punished for not doing so when Andy Reid missed a good chance of an equaliser near the end. At the top of the list of players in a more clinical finishing mood was Sheffield United's Paul Peschisolido. He scored all the goals in the 3-0 win at Gillingham . Goal addicts could have had no complaints about the action at Cardiff City - especially in a pulsating first half in which the home team fought back from two goals down after nine minutes against Rotherham United to make it 3-2. Cardiff, who got their third goal through Robert Earnshaw's first in eight games, as a result of a mistake by Rotherham keeper Mike Pollitt, were not able to get any more. But as they had lost their five previous matches, just getting three points was enough to make them happy. Preston North End also came from behind to win 2-1 at West Ham United . The Hammers were turned over by two goals in three minutes, from Ricardo Fuller and David Healy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
