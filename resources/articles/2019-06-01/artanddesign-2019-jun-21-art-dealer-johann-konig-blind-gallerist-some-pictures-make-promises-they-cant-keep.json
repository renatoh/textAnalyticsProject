Severely sight-impaired as a result of a freak accident in his teens, K\u00f6nig could barely make out the contours of the painting he was exchanging for \u20ac4,500. \u201cHow serious can you take someone who can\u2019t see the artwork they are trying to sell you?\u201d K\u00f6nig told the Guardian at his office inside his gallery, a converted brutalist church in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district. \u201cThat fear was always in the back of my mind. I always thought someone would find me out.\u201d But in what he calls his \u201ccoming out\u201d memoir, published in Germany this month with the title Blind Gallerist, K\u00f6nig argues his disability has been key to the success he has enjoyed since, encouraging him to develop a distinctly personal idea of what makes good art, and enabling him to navigate an industry that can bedazzle and lead people astray with flashy exteriors. Born in Cologne in 1981, K\u00f6nig grew up in art world royalty. His mother Edda was an actress and illustrator previously married to filmmaker Wim Wenders, his father Kasper a curator whom S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung has dubbed \u201cthe inventor of Germany\u2019s post-war avant-garde\u201d. His uncle Walther is a leading seller and publisher of art books, painter Gerhard Richter was the best man at his parents\u2019 wedding, and Andy Warhol and David Hockney were regular visitors at his childhood home. But an accident when he was twelve cut Johann K\u00f6nig\u2019s access to the visual business that had made his family\u2019s name. Playing with fishing weights and the gunpowder from a starter pistol in his teenage bedroom, he accidentally caused an explosion which severely damaged both his eyes. Going blind did not mean the world around him went black, however. \u201cIn truth you mostly see a dark rusty brown, a mix of red, brown and black, little craters that appear to be moving\u201d, he writes in his book. \u201cYour vision is as if you want to gaze out from the inside of your body and hit an impenetrable layer. You see as if your vision has been locked inside your body\u201d. Against the advice of his family, K\u00f6nig started his own small gallery in Berlin when he was only 21, specialising at first in concept art and sound installations. His breakthrough work, by Danish sculptor Jeppe Hein, consisted of a motorised metal ball that wrecked the gallery\u2019s interior as soon as a visitor entered the exhibition space. Following a cornea transplant in his left eye in 2009, K\u00f6nig\u2019s vision improved dramatically, though his relationship with visual art remained wary. \u201cAt first, I was incredibly drawn towards strong pictures\u201d, he said. The first show he put on after the operation was a large-scale work with bright, unmixed acrylic paints by artist Katharina Grosse. \u201cBut I remained sceptical\u201d, K\u00f6nig said. \u201cThere are some pictures which are incredibly tempting but make promises that they can\u2019t keep. They wear themselves out in their beauty. \u201cAfter my operation I saw really significant works, like Duchamp\u2019s urinal or a Picasso, and they felt so marginal. Sometimes being able to see isn\u2019t that great after all, or at least not for me.\u201d In recent years, K\u00f6nig\u2019s eyesight has deteriorated again as the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of his cornea have failed to regenerate. Next month, he is trying out glasses that project footage from a minuscule camera straight behind the cornea. His gallery, housed since 2015 in St Agnes church, designed by modernist architect Werner D\u00fcttmann in the 1960s, has nonetheless established itself as one of Germany\u2019s most influential addresses in the art world, with a roster of artists that includes Turner Prize winner Helen Martin, an annual turnover of \u20ac20m and a new London outlet, opened last year inside a garage in Marylebone. As if to compensate for their disability, K\u00f6nig writes in his book, blind people are often capable of an unusual degree of inner concentration and heightened perception. Critics have praised the 37-year-old\u2019s ability to spy the art world\u2019s vanities and make them work to his advantage. The gallery, which lies almost exactly on the geographic centre point of the German capital, has hosted fashion shows as well as art exhibitions, and sells clothes as well as \u201csouvenirs\u201d made by its artists, photogenically curated on K\u00f6nig\u2019s Instagram feed. In the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, K\u00f6nig\u2019s gallery released a collection of hoodies in the bright blue colours of the EU flag, but with one yellow star missing from the circle. Within weeks, the \u201cEUnify Hoodie\u201d became ubiquitous in Berlin\u2019s hippest galleries, and in February this year even 73-year-old veteran diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger was seen wearing one during the opening of the Munich Security Conference. In the run-up to May\u2019s European elections, German politicians from the centre-left Social Democrats, the Greens, the pro-business Free and even Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right wore EU hoodies in campaign posters. However, Johann K\u00f6nig now worries that his gallery\u2019s stunt may end up undermining its original intention. \u201cWe wanted to use our reach with young people to remind a younger generation that you cannot take borderless travel and peace in Europe for granted\u201d, he said. \u201cBut when a leading politician wears our EU hoodie in a television ad, that sort of kills the hipness factor in an instant\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
