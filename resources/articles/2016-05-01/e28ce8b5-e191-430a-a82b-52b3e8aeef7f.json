The International Olympic Committee will be on the panel for Thursday\u2019s session, which will form part of the prime minister\u2019s global anti-corruption summit, to be attended by representatives from more than 50 countries. Anti-corruption campaigners are privately sceptical about the focus on sport, warning that it is a distraction from the more serious issue of cracking down on kleptocrats and the companies that help them to hide their ill-gotten gains. But senior government officials said: \u201cThere\u2019s a point here: most people in the world see a real value for sport, and you want to know, whether you are playing or spectating, that the sport you are watching or taking part in is a free and fair competition.\u201d He said the discussion would focus on, \u201chow international sporting bodies improve their governance; and how governments and international organisations can support those processes\u201d. Sepp Blatter, the disgraced former head of Fifa, resigned after US authorities began pursuing claims of endemic corruption at the Geneva-based organisation. Blatter\u2019s successor, Gianni Infantino, was cited in the Panama Papers leaks over allegations of suspicious payments while he was legal services director at Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body. He denies any wrongdoing. Neither institution was invited to the summit, officials said. Asked why Fifa \u2013 the most prominent sporting body involved in a corruption scandal in recent years \u2013 was not attending, the official said: \u201cWe have had long discussions with a number of sports bodies; Fifa and Uefa have been involved at times.\u201d The head of the Sierra Leonean football association, Isha Johansen \u2013 who has fought a battle against corruption \u2013 will attend. No 10 said the approach of the summit, which is being held at Lancaster House in London, was to bring together countries and institutions that had performed well in tackling corruption; with those that needed to take tougher action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
