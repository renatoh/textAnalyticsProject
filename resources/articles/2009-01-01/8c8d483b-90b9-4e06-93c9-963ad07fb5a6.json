I thought he was perfectly fine and even quite good for a while. \"And we know today that Dr. King and a great cloud of witnesses are shouting in heaven\" was a terrific line. Nothing divisive. Until he got to the Lord's Prayer. Why did he have to throw that in? Pretty inappropriate? What were Jews and Muslims and Hindus supposed to do during that? And even Catholics, since he used the Protestant version? Bad form. \u0095Joseph Lowery, the legendary civil rights activist, was great in his benediction. Especially the humor at the end: \"Lord, in the memory of all the saints who from their labors rest, and in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back, when brown can stick around . . .when yellow will be mellow . . .when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right.\" I suppose some whiteys might be offended. This whitey is not. \u0095Gorgeous performance by Itzhak Perlman, Yo Yo Ma, Anthony McGill and Gabriela Montero on John Williams' Air and Simple Gifts, a reworking of Copland's Appalachian Spring. Far more moving, for me, than Aretha Franklin's My Country 'Tis of Thee. She wasn't in her best voice. Williams' song had a perfect dramatic structure, and the performances were flawless and emotive. And man, those four weren't wearing any coats! Watch it here. \u0095Elizabeth Alexander's poem: a little disappointing, I thought. In a way, it echoed Obama's speech. He was less soaring than we'd have expected; and she found no great poetic metaphor, no eternal or universal idea, but a series of prosaic images. It reads better on paper than it came across. She looked pretty nervous, or maybe she was just cold. Both understandable. Anyway, it was nice to have a poet there. That's all anybody will remember. \u0095Ted Kennedy is fine and may go back to work as early as tomorrow, says John Kerry. Good news. \u0095Now it turns out that some actual ticket-holders were turned away. Okay, anticipating everything in a crowd this size is pretty hard to do. But the gendarmes bungled this day, and there needs to be a review. Can you imagine a middle-class or working-class family from the Midwest somewhere who invested maybe $1,500 (on the cheap \u2013 more like twice that, probably) in coming here to witness history, having actual tickets in their hands, and dad having to explain to his kids that they weren't going to see it after all, just because the authorities weren't prepared for a crowd that was exactly the size that everyone anticipated it would be? It's scandalous. \u0095Television coverage: I flipped back and forth between MSNBC and CNN. I make no value judgment of one over the other, but I merely note that they were a lot more yakky on MSNBC, while on CNN they didn't talk as much, let the images speak for themselves more. The winner of the day on TV though was John King. His little (actually, huge) photo montage (see www.cnn.com/themoment) was way cool. Check it out yourself, you can play with it online. \u0095Michele is absolutely awesome. But we knew that. \u0095On the fashion beat, by the way, she wore \"a sparkling yellow sheath dress with matching coat by Cuban-born American designer Isabel Toledo.\" Joe Biden \u2013 who also had a great day, by the way; he has a terrifically genuine happy face \u2013 wore \"a navy Hickey Freeman suit he bought at the Nordstrom's in King of Prussia, Pa.\" \u0095Speaking of Biden, I liked the way they kept introducing \"Vice President and Dr. Biden.\" Doctor. Jill Biden is, I'm pretty sure, the first non-Mrs. in the history of these affairs. That's a pretty groovy thing for all the little girls watching, no? \u0095One thing to thank Bush for: no controversial last-day pardons. I remember that eight years ago, half the inauguration day talk about was about Marc Rich and some of the other Clinton exonerees. \u0095As many have observed, Cheney in his wheelchair resembled no one so much as Mr. Potter in the later scenes of It's a Wonderful Life. Makes you wonder whether he stole some TARP money on the way out the door. \u0095Could Chief Justice John Roberts had the worst day by far of anyone. How could he not even practice the oath of office? True, Obama jumped in there a beat early at first, and that may have thrown Roberts off. But HE SCREWED UP THE OATH OF OFFICE! How do you do that? He misplaced the word \"faithfully,\" then, I'm pretty certain, things got so cocked up that Obama didn't even say some of the words (\"to the best of my ability,\" I think). I hope over the next eight years Obama rams three or four liberal justices down the guy's throat! \u0095I walked along the Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday and looked at the windows and the rooftops, thinking about how many snipers would be on duty, and how they'd secure all those windows. What a massive job that had to be. \u0095White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel signed an order this afternoon stopping all late-term Bush executive orders, pending review. The change has begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
