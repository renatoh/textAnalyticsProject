John was well known in comedyland but inexperienced in legit. He was super-nervous and hopeless with props: opening champagne bottles, pouring drinks, lighting fags, etc. In rehearsals, to begin with, whenever he had to pour or smoke or walk and talk simultaneously, his astonishingly hyper-connective brain would short out and frazzle, and in his frustration John would launch into savage impro-monologues, viciously cursing and berating himself. If a firework could self-flagellate, this is what it might look like. Or sound like. Brand new verbs such as \u201cChrist-stabbing\u201d came spinning out like shrapnel. His improvisations in self-abuse had us all howling with laughter. We\u2019d end up lying on our backs with our arms and legs in the air. Then begin again. \u201cWhere do you want to go from, John?\u201d I\u2019d ask. \u201cSorry. Can we go from here \u2026 No, actually here. Actually here, would you mind?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 that\u2019s seven pages earlier. From where you come on?\u201d \u201cDo you mind? Shit. Sorry. Does anybody mind?\u201d No one ever minded. He sweated and worked, and worked and sweated. His sometimes mad, sometimes gentle intelligence filled the room, but never dominated it. His kindness and mischief and affection made him irresistible. And, most surprising of all, by the end of weeks of rehearsals, the bastard had us all sobbing hopelessly into our teacups \u2026 his performance was unbelievably delicate, muted, loaded, true."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
