The report by the European Leadership Network (ELN) thinktank calls on both sides to communicate more and to improve the transparency of their military activities. It also encourages them to wind down the scale of their war games while starting work on a new treaty that would limit the sort of weaponry allowed along their borders. \u201cEach exercise is seen as provocative by the other side and feeding a dynamic of distrust and unpredictability,\u201d Ian Kearns, ELN\u2019s director, said. \u201cEveryone is focusing on the deterrent value of big exercises, but there is a downside and that is the risk factor. Politicians have to show political judgment and restraint about when is the right time to scale down what could be a spiralling sequence of exercises.\u201d The ELN report is titled Preparing for the worst: are Russian and Nato military exercises making war in Europe more likely? It analyses two recent mass war games: a Russian \u2018snap exercise\u2019 in March involving 80,000 military personal from bases all across the country, and Nato\u2019s Allied Shield set of war games conducted on air, land and sea in June, and drawing in 15,000 personnel from 22 countries. \u201cBoth exercises show that each side is training with the other side\u2019s capabilities and most likely war plans in mind,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhilst spokespeople may maintain that these operations are targeted against hypothetical opponents, the nature and scale of them indicate otherwise: Russia is preparing for a conflict with Nato, and Nato is preparing for a possible confrontation with Russia.\u201d The Russian exercise in March started in the far north and spread across the federation in order to mimic a rapidly escalating conflict. Troops were deployed to reinforce vulnerable outlying regions like the Kola peninsula, islands in the Arctic, the Kaliningrad enclave, Crimea and the north Pacific island of Sakhalin. As well as the huge number of elite forces and conscripts, the exercise involved 12,000 pieces of heavy equipment, 65 warships, 15 submarines and 220 aircraft. Nato\u2019s exercises in June comprised a naval action in the Baltic with a focus on amphibious operations in Sweden and Poland; a conventional-force exercise focused on Poland and the Baltic states that included airborne and tank clashes; and the first deployment of a joint task force set up specifically to address fears among Baltic states of Russian infiltration and the use of irregular fighters, as witnessed in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Each exercise led to close military encounters as each side approached the other\u2019s war games to assess their capability and hardware. The ELN report said that the Russian practice of not giving notice of its exercises added to the risk of unintended clashes and contributed to the general level of tension. \u201cIt is vitally important to increase Nato-Russia communication with regards to the schedule of exercises,\u201d the ELN report recommended, adding that the two sides should use the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to pass on details of war exercises in advance. The report also called on each side to weigh the costs and benefits of intensive exercises in border areas, and to show restraint in their scale. Lastly, the thinktank \u2013 which brings together former defence ministers and senior ex-officials from Europe and Russia \u2013 appealed for work to begin on \u201ca new treaty introducing reciprocal territorial limitations on deployment of specific categories of weapons, backed by robust inspections\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
