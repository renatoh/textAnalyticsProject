Meanwhile, today's monthly survey of the housing market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) shows the biggest number of new buyer enquiries in nearly a decade. The BRC's monthly snapshot of large retailers showed that total sales rose 6.3% in April compared with April last year and like-for-like sales, which exclude changes in floor space, rose by 4.6% year-on-year. At first sight the results tally with those of the CBI last week, which also said sales were strong last month. But the employers body was worried that the figures might be misleading, and so is the BRC. Stephen Robertson, BRC director general, said: \"The best sales growth for three years is good news, but let's be cautious. A sunny Easter that fell in April this year is the key reason why overall sales are up, compared with last year when Easter was in March and miserable. \"Following a tough winter, there's some pent-up demand, but there's no reason to think customers suddenly feel flush or eager to spend. With unemployment set to grow through the rest of the year, mounting jobs worries will hold back spending for some time. It would be great if the historically weak performance of the last 12 months was behind us, but we shouldn't celebrate yet.\" In its monthly composite leading indicator for the world's major economies, the Paris-based OECD pointed yesterday to \"tentative\" signs of a slower pace of decline in the UK, Italy, France and China, even though the world economy as a whole remained in deep recession. The OECD's tempered optimism fits with a report from Rics today, showing housing sales recovering from a very low level. New enquiries in the housing market increased for the sixth consecutive month, with 41% more surveyors reporting a rise rather than a fall in new buyer enquiries, up from 32% in March. A spokesman for Rics, Jeremy Leaf, said: \"There are tentative signs that the market is starting to pick up, but transactions remain at very low levels and we are unlikely to see significant improvement while money remains in short supply and the employment picture is uncertain.\" He said house prices could stabilise soon but added: \"Prospective purchasers \u2013 and first-time buyers particularly \u2013 will continue to encounter challenges, while banks maintain current loan-to-value ratios and make accessibility difficult even for those who have accumulated considerable equity in their existing properties.\" The survey showed that 60% more surveyors reported a fall rather than a rise in house prices, though that was an improvement from March's 72% figure. The strong retail sales figure was, however, at odds with a BRC consumer confidence survey out yesterday, which showed optimism had fallen sharply owing to fears of rising unemployment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
