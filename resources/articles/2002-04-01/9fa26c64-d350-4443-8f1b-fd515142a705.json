The injuries sustained by Arsenal's Sol Campbell and Middlesbrough's Ugo Ehiogu in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final meant that this game had acquired extra significance for Brown. But the defender was left out after a ball struck him in the eye during a practice match and left him with blurred vision. \"It's disappointing for him but he has plenty of big games coming up for Manchester United that the England coach will be watching,\" Platt said. \"This has not hindered his World Cup hopes.\" Brown's absence robbed the game of the only player with a realistic chance of making the plane to the far east. The likes of Gareth Barry, David Dunn and Alan Smith failed to take the opportunity to persuade Eriksson otherwise. Platt's side rarely produced a passing movement of note during a turgid opening 45 minutes when only a half-hearted penalty appeal for handball provided an enthusiastic capacity crowd with cause for optimism. The visitors looked comfort able when not in possession and threatened on the break. They deserved the lead presented to them when Candido Costa's routine right-wing free-kick sailed hopefully into the penalty area and Tonel rose unchallenged to head past the unprotected Paul Robinson. Ednilson's curling shot against the post minutes later confirmed the impression that England were second best. \"I thought we were abysmal in the first half,\" Platt admitted. \"We got suckered into playing into the hands of a typical European team who were happy to defend deep and catch us on the break.\" The half-time introduction of the towering Peter Crouch for the subdued Malcolm Christie added another dimension to England's play and the Aston Villa striker finally pro duced the home side's first meaningful attempt on goal 10 minutes after the interval when he headed Gareth Barry's floated free-kick over. England displayed a growing spirit of adventure with Crouch, twice, and Jermain Defoe coming close but presented Platt with more questions than answers ahead of next month's European Championship. \"The only way I will be able to assess if we picked up anything positive out of the game will be when I see the players again and find out if they have learnt anything,\" Platt said.
