Over the years he's also gone from being Britain's Nicest Man to The World's Nicest Man, since the Mestre, a community leader from one of the favelas, said to him in the first episode of Brazil with Michael Palin (BBC1): \"You are a very famous man throughout the world.\" And it does rather tell. A more accurate title for this show might have been Michael Palin's Brazil, because I'm fairly certain the kind of experiences Palin has are not the kind that are on offer to the rest of us. I'm well aware that these travel programmes are expensive to make and that dogsbodies have been sent ahead to prepare for the arrival of Our Man in Linen, but I couldn't help wondering if Palin was inadvertently giving us a window into what it must be like to be Prince Charles. HRH may have plenty of self-inflicted wounds, but it must be hard not to be a bit deluded when everywhere you go the toilets are always sparkling, there's always a fresh bar of soap, you never have to wait for anything and crowds of people laugh at your jokes. It felt much the same here, for as Palin headed off through Alcantara, S\u00e3o Luis, Recife, Salvador in the north-east of Brazil he was invariably accompanied by a knowledgable local guide who had appeared from nowhere to get him up to speed on the history of the region and introduce him to its customs. So it was that Palin went on to make a fool of himself, first by playing out of time with a group of traditional drummers and then by revealing himself to have two left feet during a capoeira dance, before being escorted around a fish market by Dada, Brazil's prima celebrity chef, who then treated him to dinner \u00e0 deux. Prince Charles must have dozens of such embarrassing clips lying around in his DVD collection at Highgrove. Not that this was bad television; Palin is a thoroughly agreeable companion with whom to spend an hour on a Wednesday evening and I will happily join him again for the remaining three episodes. But it did feel a bit like Brazil on Valium. I know it's a bit much to ask Palin to get stuck in to a shoot-out between two drug cartels, yet something a little less cosy shouldn't have been too hard. So far he has only managed to take in the most historic and picturesque locations and the only poor people he has bumped into are those actively engaged in do-good projects to improve their lot and save them from crime. We were promised a glimpse of the noise and vibrancy of Brazil. So far, it looks more like the Algarve; I'm not sure even the Brazilians would recognise this as Brazil. By its fourth season, the sci-fi series Fringe (Sky 1) had lost more than half its audience in the US, so this fifth season \u2013 a shortened run of 13 episodes \u2013 is going to be the show's final outing. This may not be enough of a temptation for anyone who has managed to miss it so far, but it should be more than enough for those who were beginning to get a bit lost in the parallel universes, time-shifts and singularities, as we are promised an epic final blow-out in which all the many loose ends will get resolved. Providing you are in the right universe and haven't already forgotten that the loose end hasn't been tied, of course. Should you be a Fringe virgin, all you really need to know is that it is now 2034, New York is being run by the evil Observers who have trashed Central Park because they will die if they get too much oxygen and mankind's last hope is Walter, Peter and Olivia, aka The Fringe Division, who need to get the Transilience Thought Unifier working again so that Walter can remember what his cunning plan is. At some point in all this, you may find yourself wondering how the Observers have come to be ruling the world since they appear to be remarkably stupid, as our heroes manage to infiltrate their HQ and free Walter, killing dozens of baddies in the process, with little difficulty. On the other hand, you may find yourself thinking this is the most enjoyable sci-fi series of all time and you don't care that the plotting and the dialogue is schlock. It really is a parallel universe out there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
