Bristling with purpose and physical resolution, the Swedes withstood a barrage of attacks to reach the second round as group winners, where they will meet Senegal in Oita on Sunday. In doing so they extended their unbeaten run in competitive fixtures to 13 games, dating back to a 2-1 defeat by Italy in Eindhoven during Euro 2000. \"The sky's the limit now,\" said the Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman, who had played a key role in keeping their opponents at bay. \"And why not? No one thought we would get this far.\" The Swedes' happiness contrasted sharply with the gloom in the Argentina dressing room which was compounded by the first-half dismissal of Claudio Caniggia from the bench for abusive language. Anders Svensson gave Sweden the lead with a bending free-kick from 30 yards just short of the hour after he had been tripped by Matias Almeyda. The Southampton player needed treatment before rising to score and, while he was down, Gabriel Batistuta's international career ended ignominiously as he was substituted for Hernan Crespo. \"That was the best moment of my life,\" said Svensson of his goal. \"It was fantastic. I really wanted to take that free-kick. I had a feeling it was mine to score from.\" Up to that point Argentina had dominated and they continued to do so but never really looked like scoring. Then, with two minutes left, Ariel Ortega was brought down by Mattias Jonsson in the penalty area. Ortega took the penalty, Hedman saved it diving to his left but Crespo, reacting quickest, hammered in the equaliser. It was far too late, though, to save Argentina. Sweden (4-4-2): Hedman; Mellberg, Mjallby, Jakobsson, Lucic; Alexandersson, Linderoth, A Svensson (Jonsson, 68), M Svensson; Allback (Andersson, h-t), Larsson (Ibrahimovic, 88) Booked: M Svensson, Larsson.
