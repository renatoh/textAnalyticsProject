I say \"for most\" as I'd been inside for a couple of years before she found out where I was. Then she wrote to me regularly. She'd had troubles, most significantly the death of her husband, my Uncle Dirk, after they had been together for 31 years. He died suddenly, unexpectedly. When she talked about it in her letters it was hard to know how to respond. They had known each other for such a long time, since their early teens. They had had their ups and downs and their thick and thin, but they had been happy and committed and anyone who knew them would have expected them to be together long into their old age. When he died he was younger than I am now. I remember writing back to her at the time, \"It's rare that people who love each other get to be together for so long.\" I hoped that by getting her to focus more on what she'd had than what she had lost her pain would be eased. She told me that my words had been helpful. I was pleased about that, because when I was young and had troubles Aunt Jonty had often helped me. The door of her modest, spotlessly clean home in a small Scottish town was always open. Unannounced, I'd land on her doorstep, and regardless of my circumstances there was always a warm welcome waiting. In the house my four cousins were lively and hospitable. I'd go on long walks with Uncle Dirk, a great local character with a prodigious knowledge of the countryside. I enjoyed the taste of family life, but never stayed too long - just long enough for some respite. When it was time to leave, Aunt Jonty would make a point of telling me, \"Never forget, there's always a roof here for you.\" Uncle Dirk would nod and shake my hand. \"Come back whenever you need to.\" Eventually Aunt Jonty visited me in prison. Prison visits are special times for inmates. As well as bringing you close to family and friends they also bring welcome breaks in the monotony of the prison routine. As soon as you wake up it's the first thing on your mind. The heart beats that little bit faster. When you look in the mirror, as you take an extra close shave, you can see your eyes shining and the colour drifting back into your face. The workshops, the education department, mopping landings, cleaning wings, all become more interesting. Even bang-up becomes bearable. If you're lucky enough to be out and about and a fellow con asks, \"All right?\" you smile and answer with an upbeat, \"Yeah, great thanks. I'm on a visit this aft.\" A visit is a reminder that you haven't been forgotten. People are still thinking about you. Somebody still cares. But you don't always appreciate the effort the visitor makes to get to see you. For Aunt Jonty the effort was major, beginning with a 12-hour bus trip. Sometimes it was longer, but she never complained. She'd pack food and books and magazines to read on the way. \"It's an adventure,\" she'd tell me. After an overnight stay, we'd have the visit. She never mentioned the searches at the gate, or how she felt about being sniffed at by a prison dog. There would just be hugs and smiles and news, and when it was time for her to go, a tear or two. I have to admit, once she'd gone I'd get my head back into doing my time, without dwelling too much on what Aunt Jonty had had to go through to see me. It was a long way to come for a visit lasting an hour and a half, or maybe two hours if we were lucky, and a long way back. She made that trip two or three times a year, and not a year went by that she did not remember my birthday and Christmas. Single-handedly she kept me in socks and underwear - and calendars. Every January she'd send me a new one, usually with a tartan theme and a cheery, \"Happy New Year from Bonnie Scotland\". I was never one for marking off days or weeks, but I was happy to hang those calendars on my cell wall and let them mark the passing of the years. Last week Aunt Jonty came to visit again, this time to my home. It was hard not to let her spend any money during the few days she was here. She's very proud, you see. But as much as I could, I made sure it was my treat. When it was time for her to go home she said, \"Thank you so much, son for a lovely time.\" No, Aunt Jonty, thank you. \u00b7 The Home Stretch, Erwin James' second collection of Guardian columns, is published by Guardian Books.
