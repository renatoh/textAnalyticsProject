It is this: to maintain Fifa\u2019s so-called victim status in the eyes of the US Department of Justice and the Swiss prosecutors who have brought the organisation to its knees. If wide-ranging, but to many still unsatisfactory, reforms are not voted through nextweek or it fails to continue to consistently keep up the supply of evidence from inside Fifa HQ, then there are fears that status could change and prompt the end game of complete institutional collapse. This, then, is the stark warning that will be delivered to the 209 Fifa members (207 of whom can vote as things stand) before a week when they will vote on those reforms and decide the identity of their third president in 42 years: change or die. It is not altogether clear that they have got the message. Rewind to May at Zurich\u2019s Hallenstadion, the same cavernous conference hall that will host this week\u2019s special Congress, and a victorious Sepp Blatter could be seen mingling to the soundtrack of an oompah band. It proved to be a pyrrhic victory, with the now banned Blatter forced to promise to stand down days later when the scale and ramifications of the full frontal assault on the culture and practices of Fifa and its regional confederations became clear even to him. So much has changed since May, with many of the biggest beasts in Fifa\u2019s jungle forced to leave the scene. Yet much stays the same, in the familiar, depressing feeling that football knows best. The very words themselves \u2013 reform, transparency, independence \u2013 have been debased by Blatter\u2019s tenure. Fifa has produced a jaunty film to explain the package of reforms that its members will vote on this Friday. There\u2019s also a PowerPoint presentation that concludes, correctly, that \u201cthe future of Fifa and football hangs in the balance\u201d. The package of reforms \u2013 arrived at following a convoluted and mildly chaotic process driven by a combination of the former International Olympic Committee executive Fran\u00e7ois Carrard, the audit and compliance committee chairman, Domenico Scala, and the very confederations that got Fifa into this mess \u2013 are all sensible enough. They include a requirement that key committees \u2013 including the finance, development and governance committees \u2013 consist of 50% independent members. The audit and compliance committee will become, in theory, entirely independent. Crucially, the executive committee will be replaced by a Fifa council that will set the strategic direction of the organisation. Overseen by a president with diminished power, that strategy will be enacted by an operational board of Fifa executives who will be responsible for commercial deals \u2013 hopefully removing the toxic mix of the political, commercial and allegedly criminal that characterised the past four decades. The number of committees will be drastically reduced and those sitting on them will be required to have relevant experience. All this, so the pitch goes, will end the days when Julio Grondona and the under-indictment Jack Warner could be chairman and deputy chairman of the finance committee. The key reforms that most can agree on \u2013 term limits, transparency on pay and so on \u2013 are there. We will finally find out how much Blatter earned. But still the nagging feeling remains that the reforms lack two key things that may have given them more credibility in the eyes of a world that has long since lost any confidence in Fifa\u2019s ability to heal itself \u2013 first, sufficient independent oversight, and second, any mechanism for forcing the confederations that have been at the root of the problems to repeat the changes down the pyramid. It is a huge task. When public companies such as Enron collapse into criminality and chaos, they are liquidated. Fifa is trying to rebuild itself from within. One key recommendation \u2013 that all 209 member associations must produce independently audited accounts on an annual basis \u2013 has the power to be transformative. But bearing in mind that a Transparency International study last year found that 81% of national associations had no publicly available accounts \u2013 plus the extent to which corruption is endemic in the system that Blatter built \u2013 it requires a big leap of faith. Even as this brave new world has been pitched Fifa\u2019s disparate, often desperate, roll call of presidential candidates have toured the world sealing deals and trying to quell controversy in a depressing parade that has been endlessly reminiscent of campaigns past. The twin favourites remain the Asian Football Confederation president, Bahrain\u2019s Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, and Uefa\u2019s general secretary, Gianni Infantino of Switzerland. The former was closely linked to Blatter, the latter to Michel Platini, the now banned former Uefa president. Hardly the winds of change. Gareth Sweeney, editor of Transparency International\u2019s Global Corruption Report: Sport, says: \u201cThe presidential process has itself shown again why Fifa needs urgent reform. The fact that some candidates are running without a manifesto, that a majority refused to participate in any public debate and that the decisions on eligibility remain a secret, despite some very serious allegations relating to at least one candidate, does not boost public trust. Nor does it increase confidence that the next president will lead by example in enacting serious reforms.\u201d Quite. It has been a campaign short on debate and long on the sort of vote trading, politicking, promises and dirty tricks that have characterised Fifa election campaigns since Adidas\u2019s Horst Dassler helped propel Jo\u00e3o Havelange into power in 1974. Yet the view of the tiny circle of hardy optimists at Fifa HQ is that the vote can be a first small step towards a brighter future where the wide-ranging governance reforms they propose will, over time, transform the most tarnished, embedded culture in global sport and bring sponsors and the public back on board. But viewing Sheikh Salman\u2019s aggressive attempts to quash, by legal means, the legitimate questioning of his role in the suppression of 2011 pro-democracy protests in Bahrain and other historic allegations, one cannot help but feel queasy about the future. Meanwhile, a coalition of NGOs that wrote to all the candidates concluded that not one of them had pledged adequate steps to prevent human rights abuse and corruption. Even if the reforms are approved (and that is far from certain, given the 75% mandate required), then the culture change required is so vast and far reaching that it may prove beyond Fifa\u2019s grasp. No one has followed the events of the past year would rule out a further major twist or two. Blatter, still fighting his case to the bitter end, will lurk on the fringes of the circus where he was ringmaster. There is the usual churning rumour mill about the intentions of the candidates and what stunts they may be planning to secure victory, but of more significance is whether the US or Swiss authorities are planning another dawn swoop on the luxury Baur au Lac hotel a venue has become a byword for Fifa malfeasance. No matter how much those gathering in Zurich this week might pretend otherwise, they are no longer in control of their destiny."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
