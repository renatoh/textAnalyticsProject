Westwood, back in the event for the first time since 2002, does not have to wait too long, teeing off at 10.49am. But Clarke and Woods are in the third-last group at 1.33pm - just ahead of Ernie Els, David Toms and Adam Scott. The third member of Westwood's group is the American Chad Campbell, while Clarke and Woods are joined by Paraguay's Carlos Franco. Padraig Harrington, Europe's leading player at sixth in the world rankings, is off at 9.27am with Fuzzy Zoeller and Angel Cabrera, while Phil Mickelson begins his title defence with the American amateur champion Ryan Moore and Australia's Stuart Appleby for company. They go out at 10.38am. David Howell's debut sees him in the very first group at 8.05am, with Ian Woosnam immediately behind. The British amateur champion Stuart Wilson, from Scotland, partners the five-times Open champion Tom Watson and former US Open champion Jim Furyk at 11.22am. Organisers will have one eye on the weather however, with thunderstorms having been forecast for Thursday morning. After weeks of speculation, Jack Nicklaus announced yesterday that he had decided to play in this year's event at the prompting of his family. Nicklaus said he had decided to play after talking to his son Steve, whose 17-month-old son Jake drowned last month. \"He said to me 'Go play'. So that's why I am here,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
