A fair few, would be the short answer, and we have already covered testimonials gone bad in the Knowledge before, but a few stand-out examples do spring to mind and none more so than QPR's fracas with China's Olympic team in 2007. China had been holding a two-week training camp in England, but seven players had to be sent home after a brawl that involved almost every player on the pitch plus a number of coaches and bystanders. \"I've never seen anything like it in my life,\" one witness told the Ealing Gazette at the time. \"There were punches, kung-fu kicks and all sorts. It was absolute mayhem.\" China's Zheng Tao was knocked out and suffered a fractured jaw in the melee, and QPR were later fined \u00a320,000, with assistant manager Richard Hill suspended for three months. But while that set-to took place on a muddy training field, Thailand and Qatar held their own epic brawl live on national TV back in 1998. Qatar's players had reacted badly to a decision by referee Ekchai Thanatdeunkhao early in the second half, disputing it for more than five minutes before one Thai player came over to complain about the delay. He got shoved in the chest, and then all hell broke loose. The game was eventually abandoned, after a series of running battles involving both sets of players and even one or two journalists, who reportedly began \"throwing debris from the sidelines\". Falkirk's pre-season encounter with Turkish side Rizespor in 2006 ended similarly abruptly after a series of skirmishes on and off the pitch. Relations between the sides got off to a bad start after Rizespor showed up at 5.37pm for a match that was scheduled to kick off at 3pm, and the officials then walked off the field after 22 minutes when a scuffle broke out in the Falkirk area. They were persuaded to return and Rizespor scored soon afterwards. When Falkirk scored early in the second half, however, Rizespor's goalkeeper Atilla Koca took exception to the celebrations of Bairns fans behind his goal and quickly became embroiled in a fight with a number of them. The match was swiftly abandoned. Then again, not all players know how to get involved in such a dust-up. Ivica Olic and Carlos Eduardo may both have been spoiling for a scrap during a friendly - admittedly during the Bundesliga winter break - between Hamburg and Hoffenheim in February, but frankly the game of overhand slapsies that ensued may help explain why footballers don't do this more often.

Let us know at knowledge@theguardian.com HOME GAMES AT DIFFERENT GROUNDS \"Jonny Allan has played home games for Northwich Victoria at four different grounds (The Drill Field, Wincham Park, Victoria Stadium and Moss Lane),\" writes Wayne Duncan. \"Has anyone ever played home games at more than four venues whilst still playing for the same team?\" First things first. Let's agree that national teams are discounted, so Germany internationals who may have played at all 39 cities which regularly host Die Mannschaft's matches will have to sit this one out. \"I would imagine a Corinthians player in Brazil may have played home games in more than four different venues,\" writes Paulo Padhila. \"Especially in recent times. The club doesn't have a proper home stadium, so they play most often in the city's stadium, Pacaembu. However, they host derbies and other big matches in S\u00e3o Paulo's stadium, Morumbi. Over the past several years they have started hosting games outside the city of S\u00e3o Paulo as well, to take advantage of the fact that they are the second most popular club in the country. They have played state championship games in Presidente Prudente and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto recently, as well as hosting a few matches in the state of Paran\u00e1 (not sure which cities exactly). I would think there's at least one player who has taken part in a number of these games over the past few years.\" Well, Paulo, you're right that the side's home matches have become a bit of a roadshow in recent years, and for most teams in Europe this would probably have led to a player appearing at more than four home grounds, however, such is the transient nature of footballers at Brazilian sides, Corinthians' longest-serving player, the goakeeper Felipe, has still only been there a little over two years. And as far as our research shows, in that time he has played at, Paulo Machado de Carvalho, Morumbi and Alfredo Schuring. So only three different grounds. Sean DeLoughrey believes the League of Ireland might be home to the player who holds the record. \"Shamrock Rovers spent 20 years on the road after their Glenmalure Park home in Milltown was sold from under them in 1987,\" he writes. \"They spent periods ground sharing with Shelbourne (Tolka Park), Bohemians (Dalymount Park) and St Pats (Richmond Park) and also spent seasons at home at the RDS and Morton Stadium before finally moving into their own home in Tallaght Stadium in 2009. Hoops legend Derek Tracey played 486 league games for Rovers without playing a single proper 'home' game, but he did play home games for Rovers at five venues: Tolka Pk, Dalymount Pk, the RDS, Morton Stadium and Richmond Park. However, in 2003 Rovers played home matches against UCD and Cork at the home grounds of their opposition. So Terry Palmer can top Tracey's record having played home games for Rovers at Tolka Pk, Dalymount Pk, Richmond Pk, Morton Stadium, Belfield Park (UCD) and Turner's Cross (Cork).\" Do you know of a player who can beat six home games for one team at different grounds? Let us know at knowledge@theguardian.com COACHES SWAPPING TIPS WITH OTHER SPORTS \"While in Adelaide to attend the wedding of his daughter, former Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson attended a training session of the Port Adelaide Power Australian Football League team,\" begins Graham Clayton. \"Robson gave the coaching staff of the Power some tactical tips. Have there been many other examples where football managers have advised coaches/managers of other football codes and sports?\" Sean Hurley believes the reason Sam Allardyce has embraced technology in his managerial career, including the use of a headset, may be down to his days playing for the Tampa Bay Rowdies in football's fledgling years as a professional sport in the United States. After training with the Rowdies, Big Sam often looked in on the practice sessions of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who shared the same facilities. \"They had physiotherapists, masseurs, dieticians, psychologists, psychiatrists, coaches, doctors, all looking after these highly motivated professionals,\" said Allardyce. \"The mind is the all-powerful thing. If you're not in the right frame of mind it's going to be very difficult for you to produce your best. Americans are stat-mad, but there was no system in the game until recent years that could give you that here.\" Football has also been a source of inspiration for egg-chasers too. After the All Blacks' tour of Europe in 2008, members of the coaching staff dropped in at Milan to trade tips with their sports medicine facility. One can only presume this had much to do with finding out how to preserve the playing careers of aging sports stars, which the Rossoneri have done better than most for many years. Still on the subject of the All Blacks, Roy Keane visited Wellington to study their training methods as a requirement for the completion of his top-level Fifa coaching badge before returning to Sunderland and promptly walking out on them. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"In Roy Hattersley's book, The Edwardians, there's a photo described as 'the Edwardian England football team'. They are wearing white shirts and dark shorts, but curiously the shirts bear the Union Jack rather than the flag of St George. Was the Union Jack generally used by England teams back then, or was it just a cock-up?\" asked Matt Boyson in 2008. The Union flag was the favoured emblem of English football teams until surprisingly recently. Footage of the 1966 World Cup shows Wembley dotted with red white and blue flags, while tournament mascot World Cup Willie was a lion wearing a Union Flag jersey. In 1982 Ron Greenwood's England squad were still urging us to \"hear the roar of the red white and blue\" on official tune This Time, a seven-inch single with a union flag on the label. It was only really at Euro 96 that the nation's red-and-white fetish kicked in properly. Matthew Engel, writing in the Guardian, noted \"this new cult of St George\" after England's exit in the semi-finals. Ten years later 27% of English adults bought a flag of St George during the 2006 World Cup. And a fat lot of good it did too. Can you help? \"What is the current record crowd for a friendly in Britain?\" asks Kris Scrimgeour. \"After witnessing this effort with sponsors on their crotch, I got to wondering: what is the biggest number of sponsors a single football kit has had?\" muses Chris Bates.
