The Australians had entered the event as favourites and were undefeated this year, but the German team came out strong to establish an early lead they\u2019d never relinquish in a strong headwind and took out the 2000m race. The Germans were defending their title from London and the event had originally been scheduled for day five of the Games but was postponed on account of weather conditions. Estonia took out the bronze. Crew veteran Karsten Forsterling told reporters, \u201cWe rely on building momentum in the second 1,000 metres and that\u2019s our strength. But we got knocked about early in the race and it\u2019s hard to build momentum up again. The Germans were clear and it\u2019s hard to close down that margin.\u201d Australia\u2019s other medal of the night went to Jessica Fox, when the world No1 added a bronze medal in the K1 canoe slalom to the silver she won at the London Games. Fox had a two-second penalty in her final run with two gates remaining and finished behind Maialen Chourraut of Spain and New Zealand\u2019s Luuka Jones. Fox crossed the line in first position but said it was a \u201cfair call\u201d that judges had docked her time following a video review that confirmed she\u2019d touched a gate during her run, which put New Zealand\u2019s Luuka Jones into the lead, but both the Kiwi and Fox moved down one placing when Spain\u2019s Maialen Chourraut raced through a near-perfect run to claim gold with a time of 98.65. \u201cI haven\u2019t checked the video but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s probably there,\u201d Fox told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know but I came in tight, it wasn\u2019t a perfect upstream and I knew that I slid out so the touch could have been there.\u201d Elswehere, two wins and a fourth place have taken Australian sailing cousins Jason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin to the top of the Nacra 17 rankings five races into competition. Over at the pool, Cameron McEvoy has regrouped from his disappointment in the 100m freestyle final to cruise through to the 50m semi-finals. McEvoy clocked 21.80 seconds to be fifth fastest in the one-lap dash heats. At the velodrome, Australia\u2019s team sprint trio of Matthew Glaetzer, Nathan Hart and Patrick Constable narrowly missed out on Australia\u2019s first cycling medal of the games, beaten into fourth as Team GB claimed gold. Australia looked capable of bronze when they led France into the third and final lap, but fell short to finish one spot out of the medals for the fourth consecutive Games. \u201cThat\u2019s sport. We have been on the winning side of that scenario before,\u201d Glaezter said after the race. \u201cWe were definitely aiming for medals \u2013 it\u2019s always disappointing not to get on the podium, but I\u2019m really proud of the boys.\u201d In tennis, Australia\u2019s mixed doubles pairing of Samantha Stosur and John Peers went down to India\u2019s fourth seeds Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna 5-7, 4-6 at the Olympic Tennis Centre, meaning they miss out on a quarter final clash with Brits Heather Watson and Andy Murray, the latter of whom made a surprise appearance after receiving a late call-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
