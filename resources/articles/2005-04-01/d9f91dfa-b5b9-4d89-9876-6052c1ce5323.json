But he then came out with a string of false assertions. He challenged the fairness of university funding that abolishes upfront fees for all students, and introduces a grant and bursary scheme of at least \u00a33,000 for students from the poorest backgrounds and an interest-free loan paid back through the tax system, dependent on your income, at a rate you can afford. That's pretty fair. He suggests, dishonestly, that income from ID card charges would pay for an extra 10,000 police officers. He fails to acknowledge that police numbers are at a record high and will be supported by 24,000 community support officers. He attacks our measures to prevent terrorism by asserting, untruthfully, that only the Lib Dems said judges should make decisions. This was, in fact, agreed very early. Lib Dem opposition in the final vote was about any sort of control order for suspected terrorists. Most strikingly, he made no mention of his policy on drugs - set out in the Lib Dem manifesto - which would end criminalisation of people possessing cannabis for their personal use, put its supply on a legal basis and, most astonishingly, end imprisonment for use of any drug, including heroin and cocaine. Lib Dem MPs also voted against the measures in the 2003 anti-social behaviour bill which would permit police to close down crack houses. When Charles Kennedy says he will \"keep a wary liberal eye on the issue of civil liberty\", should he not give the same attention to residents whose lives are destroyed by dealers? Charles Clarke MP Home secretary Charles Kennedy should be congratulated for the green thread in his manifesto\", but is this more than rhetoric? In Scotland, the Lib Dem transport minister is to press ahead with the M74 (against an inquiry's advice). Other Lib Dem ministers support GM crops (against party policy), have failed to advance marine legislation and even criticise a colleague arguing for a zero-waste policy. Robin Harper MSP Scottish Green party Labour is targeting lesbian and gay voters because it has a fantastic record in bringing about equality (Labour targets gay vote with beermats, April 2). Labour has swept aside anti-gay legislation such as section 28, introduced civil partnerships for same-sex couples, equalised the age of consent and stopped lesbian and gay workers from being sacked or discriminated against. And in the next parliament, Labour will introduce a single equality act to end discrimination in the provision of goods and services. We are rightly warning a vote for a smaller party might deliver a Conservative government led by the man who allowed section 28 to become law. Katie Hanson Labour Campaign for Lesbian and Gay Rights Martin Kettle asks why there is such feeling for the death of an authoritarian but charismatic figure (Comment, April 5), while Michael Quinlan shows how the safeguards of cabinet government and an independent civil service can be undermined. Whatever the voting intentions, the election will leave most citizens losers, opposed to the government just elected. Maybe we should change the system before we find we have elected a charismatic but authoritarian figure on a minority of the vote.
