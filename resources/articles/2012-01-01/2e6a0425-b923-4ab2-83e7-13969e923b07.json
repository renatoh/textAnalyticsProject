I've missed other birthdays, because I have to work at this time of year, but this feels more difficult. \"In the past, if I had to be away, we've managed it so that she's not really noticed the difference. We've brought her party forward by a couple of days so I could be there. But she's getting older and so this is the first time I've not been there for her actual party. Hopefully, with all the excitement, she won't miss me too much. But it's not going to be an easy day for me.\" Even on Skype, with dusk settling across Radcliffe's training camp at 6.30 in the evening and small echoes of the Kenyan bush around her, it's possible to track her regret. Her day had begun, this past Sunday, with another early run. Radcliffe ran for 19 miles, tracking Mo Farah and the men, loping past herds of giraffe in the distance, with yelping barefoot children trying to keep up with the British athletes as images of Isla and London sometimes reeled through her head. I've met Radcliffe enough times to know how much the loss of days like her daughter's birthday eat away at her. There are feelings of guilt and emptiness even when, as a marathon runner rather than just a mother, she rationalises the need to be apart from Isla and her one-year-old son, Raphael. \"I was in Kenya in November,\" she says, \"and it's almost a month this time. I really, really miss the children and I kind of miss Gary [her husband] as well. I miss him as a coach and a husband. But, as an athlete, there are advantages being with a team and getting regular physio and running with Mo at high altitude.\" Farah has also had to leave his young daughter, and wife, to continue his preparations for the London Olympics. But the expectations and demands of motherhood exert more pressure on Radcliffe \u2013 and also illustrate the depth of her sacrifice as she tries to finally overcome her past bitter disappointments. London 2012 is the fifth successive Olympic Games for which she has qualified and it will be the last in which she runs. Her best so far is a fourth place in the 10,000m at the Sydney Olympics almost a dozen years ago. But the far more haunting and injury-ravaged failures of Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008 still shadow her greatest achievements \u2013 including the fact she has run the three fastest times by a woman in a marathon. Her extraordinary world record of 2hr 15min 25sec, set in 2003, should overwhelm everything else; but Radcliffe has been defined equally, and often cruelly, by her Olympic disasters. Radcliffe once told me that she loved setting \"realistic and dream goals\" every New Year's Eve. On 31 December 2011, in between her Kenyan training camps, she repeated the ritual. \"I set myself some specific goals, but the key one is just getting myself into as good a shape as possible for one day this year: the Olympic marathon. You can wish as hard as you like but all that really matters is the shape you're in on the day of the race. I've always felt these really big races aren't necessarily won by whoever is the fastest. They're won by the athlete who is the smartest and in the best shape on the day.\" Radcliffe qualified for the London Olympics last September by finishing third in the Berlin marathon in a time of 2:23.46 which she still describes as \"really disappointing\". She was seven minutes within the Olympic qualifying mark but her race symbolised \"the crappy year\" she endured in 2011. Florence Kiplagat, the Kenyan winner in Berlin and one of the favourites for Olympic gold, set a personal best of 2:19.44 \u2013 a time that remains well within Radcliffe's range. \"If I'm fit then a faster time than that is definitely feasible for me,\" Radcliffe says. \"I'd say getting down to 2:18 or even 2:17 is realistic. Hopefully, that would be more than good enough to win. I don't think we're going to get a red-hot time \u2013 especially as it's going to be a summer day and we're only starting at 11 in the morning. But you never know. The weather in London could be 15 or 35 degrees. We have to prepare for both but I still think 2:17 or 2:18 would do it.\" Radcliffe has never lost a marathon in London and she is boosted further by the memory that the 2008 Olympic marathon was won by the 38-year-old Constantina Dita of Romania in 2:26.44. \"She didn't come out of left-field,\" says Radcliffe, who also turned 38 last month. \"She'd been around a long time but it just happened that all the big favourites got things wrong. Constantina probably didn't think she was going to win a medal but she ran the perfect race for herself. It happened to be enough on that particular day.\" The field in London is likely to be much stronger than it was in Beijing four years ago. \"Definitely. You've got three great Kenyans \u2013 whoever they pick \u2013 and you can't ignore the Ethiopians, the Japanese and the Russians. There are a lot of potential winners out there.\" It's still easy for Radcliffe to imagine herself among them \u2013 if she can somehow hold her fragile body together and withstand the emotional turmoil that has afflicted her past Olympic ordeals. She suggests she is coping better than her often intense husband. \"It's been a very long buildup,\" she says, \"and on the whole Gary's not too bad. But he does worry and stress out more than I do. It's to be expected in a year like this one. But that's why having the kids around is great. You can't waste too much time fretting because there are so many things to do. Even Gary gets distracted from 2012.\" Radcliffe laughs her jangly laugh before becoming more serious. \"We've both said to each other that the important thing is not to panic this year. You can only do your best and prepare as well as possible and with any luck that will be good enough. So it certainly feels like one of my most relaxed Olympic buildups.\" The problem for Radcliffe, however, remains the doubt around her fitness. Last year she was beset by back and foot injuries and an overactive thyroid that almost led to her considering retirement. \"I thought something was badly wrong with me. I couldn't run hard any more. I couldn't do my sessions and I started to get very down. I was asking a lot of questions about myself and I wasn't enjoying it any more. So it was a huge relief when I finally got the diagnosis. At least I knew it wasn't just that I was too old and couldn't do it any more. That helped me get through it.\" Radcliffe's thyroid has now been regulated and she also appears to be making a full recovery from the operation to an ankle last autumn, when a bone spur was removed. \"I still get a bit of post-op fatigue at the end of the longest runs but it's not affected my training. I did sessions on the track over Christmas that I haven't been able to do since 2009 because my foot couldn't cope. It can now. So I'm just being careful on the really rocky trails we have out here. \"Today, for example, was a really good day. Twenty of us set off this morning and I was really pleased. I went better than last week. I hung on as long as possible with Mo and Ben [Whitby] and that was good. But by the end they were gone a long way further up the road than me.\" Radcliffe carries a special affection for Farah, an athlete she has supported and mentored for years. Farah won world championship gold and silver medals in last year's 5,000m and 10,000m, but how is he coping with the gathering weight of expectation around his Olympic chances? \"I'm really impressed with how Mo is handling things. There's a lot of pressure on him and he did a workout yesterday and there were so many people going down to watch him. I know what that's like and it's an added pressure and stress you can do without. But it seems to roll off him and he has matured so much in the last year. He's really got his head right.\" She becomes animated when assessing the huge strides Farah has made. \"I always knew Mo had this potential. You could see it in 2010 in the command he had at the Europeans. But even then he was still drifting a little and he wasn't getting the coaching guidance he needed. There were little things he could improve in a big way but ever since he's hooked up with Alberto Salazar [his new coach] he's really settled. They've concentrated on small areas \u2013 and he's now so much stronger and more stable in his core. He's not rocking and rolling and that translates to a good few seconds over five and 10k.\" Farah has yet to experience the public pressure which Radcliffe has known for so many years. \"It is a concern,\" she says. \"I would say it's the biggest concern. But he's smart and he's got everything planned between now and then and I guess he's not going to be in the UK aside from racing. That's a good thing because it means you're removed from that pressure. But, for an athlete, the biggest pressure comes from within. You know what you want to do and what you're capable of. So it's a case of keeping his head firmly screwed on and not panicking.\" Radcliffe says those words so passionately she could be talking to herself. Despite days like Tuesday when she can only accept missing her birthday girl by running hard in the Kenyan hills, she sounds like an athlete primed for one last tilt at glory. \"I have a very good gut feel about this year,\" she says. \"My gut tells me it's going to be a good year.\" And then, down the line, and across the continents, Radcliffe emits a wry little laugh. \"I guess your gut only knows so much. So we'll see. But I'm feeling good. I'm feeling strong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
