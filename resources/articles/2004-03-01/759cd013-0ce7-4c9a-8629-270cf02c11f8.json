Boro were claiming about \u00a32.5m in compensation they felt was due to them after a Premier League commission found Liverpool guilty of an illegal approach to the German international, who moved to Anfield for \u00a35.5m in August 2000. That commission, which sat a year later, dismissed the request for compensation but fined the Merseyside club \u00a320,000. The two clubs were due to meet at the high court in London on March 22 for what was expected to be a 10-day hearing, with the suspicion being that the dispute had long since degenerated into little more than a personal grudge between the Boro chairman Steve Gibson and the Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry. They, along with G\u00e9rard Houllier and the former Boro manager Bryan Robson, had all been due to give evidence. Boro had been seeking to claim a variety of costs totalling about \u00a32.5m - including lost merchandising and gate revenue, an estimated 10 points lost over the 2000/01 season and money spent to hire Terry Venables to stave off relegation. Liverpool were prepared to pay only a fraction of that, would have considered an appeal had the case gone against them, and intended to show documentary evidence that Boro could also be accused of \"tapping up\" the Anfield striker Emile Heskeyduring this January's transfer window. Yet, much to the Premier League's relief, that has now been averted. \"The decision follows discussions between the two clubs and Mr Ziege instigated by the FA Premier League,\" said the two clubs in a statement. \"Details of the settlement are confidential and no further comment will be made by any of the parties.\" The England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has said he is disappointed that plans to introduce a winter break in England have been blocked by the Football Association. The FA Cup committee voted this week against a winter break because it would mean the end of FA Cup replays in fifth- and sixth-round ties. \"I think it is very wrong,\" Eriksson told the BBC yesterday. \"You cannot find one manager not wanting a break. I don't understand why the committee went against it.\" \"I am extremely disappointed but we will go on trying to achieve that winter break.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
