His best form \u2013 a close second in last year's Scottish Grand National \u2013 gave him a chance and drying ground at Liverpool made all the difference. It is likely to be a different story on Saturday as Auroras Encore is up 11lb in the ratings and back on soft ground, so Always Right (3.50) is the one to back. He has returned to his best after a soft palate operation last year, acts on ground with some give and was a close third in this race two seasons ago off a 1lb lower mark. Newbury 1.50 Guarantee disappointed in last year's St Leger but put up one of the handicap performances of the season in the Lonsdale at York. Ayr 2.05 Sam Waley-Cohen cannot claim on Rajdhani Express, which may tip the balance in favour of Tap Night, second in a Grade One at Aintree last time. Newbury 2.20 Global Village goes well in these big-field handicaps, is just 2lb higher for second place in the Lincoln and has won for Kieren Fallon in the past. Ayr 2.40 Ifandbutwhynot was caught wide in the County Hurdle but still ran well in ninth and will appreciate conditions. Newbury 2.55 Seven furlongs may be near the limit of Rosdhu Queen's stamina but her class should see her through. Ayr 3.15 Eastlake is up just 3lb for his latest win and can remain a step ahead of the handicapper. Newbury 3.30 Moohaajim had little luck in running in the Middle Park last season and looked like he would need another winter to peak. He is bred to improve at seven furlongs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
