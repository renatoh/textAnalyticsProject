To almost every observer at the Etihad Stadium, the game was controlled by City but the Manchester United manager saw things differently. Although his side\u2019s only shot on target was the second-half penalty Anthony Martial scored in response to goals from David Silva and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, he denied the 3-1 scoreline reflected the game. \u201cIf the third goal is scored in one of the moments where they were dominating I would probably say so but it comes in a moment where we were in the fight to get the equaliser,\u201d he said. Mourinho insisted United had given \u201cnot a negative performance at all\u201d and added: \u201cIf you focus on the game today, it was open for 80-something minutes.\u201d United\u2019s manager suggested recent matches at Bournemouth and Juventus had done his players no favours when City had faced Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk at home. \u201cThe game,\u201d he said, \u201cwas open in a week when they play three home games and have 6-1, 6-0 victories, relaxed, everything nice and easy and we play two matches away, difficult where the second was like a final against one of the best teams in Europe where we give everything physically, mentally.\u201d The absence of the injured Paul Pogba disrupted United too, Mourinho pointed out. \u201cWe had to play [Marouane] Fellaini and he was not ready to play for 90 minutes. I can imagine when the result was 2-1 to bring on a fresh Fellaini, I think they would be in big, big trouble. For different reasons we missed Paul but that doesn\u2019t mean with Paul we win the game so it\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d And what of the stats? City had 66% possession and 16 shots to United\u2019s five. \u201cThe way people who don\u2019t understand football analyse it with stats. I don\u2019t go for stats. I go for what I felt in the game and it was there until minute 80-something. I consider the performance of my team one with mistakes. It is different from a bad performance.\u201d Raheem Sterling\u2019s stepovers in the final seconds drew an angry reaction from Juan Mata, who appeared to accuse the forward of showboating, and Pep Guardiola confronted the England international at the end over his behaviour. \u201cHe made some movements with the legs, we can avoid it, but he\u2019s young and he\u2019s going to improve,\u201d City\u2019s manager said. Guardiola was not entirely satisfied with the performance of his team, whose third goal came from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. \u201cFirst half not so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to lose the ball\u2019 but not the intention to attack or to do something. I feel when I watch my players, a team that feel a little bit the pressure. They want to do well in the derby. That\u2019s normal. \u201cDespite that, we were stable, we score one goal, the first 15 minutes was so good and after that we didn\u2019t press so well. They could play more than usual but the second half we start from the beginning much, much better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
