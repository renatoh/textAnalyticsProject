The Killing Eve star and the Brooklyn Nine-Nine comedian will follow in the footsteps of this year\u2019s host, Seth Meyers, next January. The pair presented together at that ceremony, ridiculing the La La Land snafu in a warmly received skit. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to welcome Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg as co-hosts of Hollywood\u2019s party of the year,\u201d said the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) president, Meher Tatna. \u201cBoth Golden Globe Award recipients have continually showcased their talents in film and television, and we can\u2019t wait see what their undeniable chemistry will bring to the Golden Globes stage.\u201d Oh is coming off the back of one of her most successful years to date. The Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor scored her first small-screen lead in Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s critically acclaimed thriller series Killing Eve, picking up an Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actress in a drama series. Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg saw his previously cancelled sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine saved by NBC, set to return next year, and previously hosted the Emmys in 2015. The news arrives a day after the Oscars announced Kevin Hart to host next year\u2019s ceremony and a day before this year\u2019s Golden Globe nominations are set to be unveiled. While the film categories are expected to be dominated by A Star is Born, Green Book and The Favourite, predicted nominees on the TV side include The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, Sharp Objects and Killing Eve. Last year\u2019s ceremony saw a continued ratings decline but still attracted 19 million viewers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
