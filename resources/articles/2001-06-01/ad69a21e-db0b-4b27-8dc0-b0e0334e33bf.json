Reynolds dominated the art world of the late-18th century and Gilbert and George are the dead centre of the international art world today. So many lines of curatorial ambition, theoretical interpretation and perceived influence meet in them that their importance is somehow a given. They play it brilliantly, appearing in group shows with the right artists, and walking from their old dealer to White Cube\u00b2, absorbing the implied lineage between them and Jay Jopling's young artists. Reynolds liked to sound off about the primacy of \"history painting\". The big photoworks that Gilbert and George have been making since they gave up being Living Sculptures claim the authority once accorded academic history paintings of the execution of Lady Jane Grey. The latest series is called New Horny Pictures and consists of adverts for male prostitutes in long, regular rows, blown up to the size of gravestones or names on a war memorial, and juxtaposed with images of themselves. Various principles of classification are applied to the ads, such as those that begin with a name, or tout an exotic identity. Any picture more than 15 metres wide had better have something significant going on. But these are bloated, trite; the size adds nothing. There's no mistaking the melancholy of these ugly ads, but where does it come from? In their 1981 film The World of Gilbert and George, showing at the Lux, the duo focus on a first world war memorial, with its statue of a squaddie bayoneting the enemy, as well as filming a young, white east ender crucified against the flag of St George. Doomed youth is an obsession. But if they are aiming at elegy here, they miss. There's a coldness in these pictures. The progress from photographs to finished work is seamless. There's no physicality, no movement, no internal drama. They create no relation to the viewer except a literary one. We stand there and read, just as we do with the dead machines of 19th-century academic art, the laborious, content-driven efforts of artists who lack the gift of economy. It's all so elaborate, and so pandering, indulging our shallow fascination with Gilbert and George's weirdness - itself a romantic cliche of the artist they have systematically exploited. They like words, well here's one: minor. \u0095 At White Cube\u00b2, London N1 (020-7930 5373), until July 15, and Lux Centre, London N1 (020-7684 0201), until July 8."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
