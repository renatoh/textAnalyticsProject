The 50-minute programme, Panorama - the International Debate, will air on BBC1, BBC World, the World Service and Radio 5 Live. It will have a potential audience of 100m viewers. The special will contain broadcasts from London, hosted by David Dimbleby; New York and Washington, hosted by Nicky Campbell; and Islamabad, hosted by Nisha Pillai. The BBC claims the show will be the first worldwide TV and radio discussion of terrorism crisis. \"We know people want to hear the issues debated and more people have been watching Panorama since September 11 as a result,\" said the programme's editor, Mike Robinson. On October 7, Panorama's John Simpson special, Afghanistan - the Dark Ages, clocked up 5.4m viewers and a 34% audience share - the best ratings for the programme since it moved from Monday to Sunday nights almost a year ago. Mr Robinson said: \"I'm pleased we can make this important international debate available to so many people worldwide.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
