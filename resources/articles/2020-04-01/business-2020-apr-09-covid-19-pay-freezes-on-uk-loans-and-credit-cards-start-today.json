From 14 April, the rules will extend to other forms of credit \u2013 such as store cards and catalogue credit \u2013 with the regulator promising to add support for car financing to its temporary measures next week. The rules were first proposed last week \u2013 and have been adopted by many banks already \u2013 but after a brief consultation have now come into force across the sector. \u2022 Personal loans and credit cards Lenders will be expected to offer a temporary payment freeze for up to three months, for consumers impacted by coronavirus. Banks have also been told that they can\u2019t suspend cards during this period. If you have a personal loan, credit card, store card, catalogue credit, guarantor loan (such as Amigo), logbook loan or home collected credit (also known as doorstep lending) you can ask for a freeze on repayments for three months. Payday loans are not yet covered by the rules and neither are cars bought on hire purchase or through a leasing deal. But the FCA said: \u201cWe are looking at these areas, and other specialist types of lending, and expect to announce specific proposals in due course.\u201d Peer-to-peer loans \u2013 such as those from Zopa and Ratesetter, do not come under the rules, although the FCA said it expects firms to help customers who are struggling. Business credit cards are also excluded from the rules. As with mortgage payment holidays, these payment freezes are not free. Customers will still have to pay the accrued interest once the deferral period ends. \u2022 Overdrafts Anyone with an arranged overdraft can ask for up to \u00a3500 of overdraft borrowing with no interest for three months. If your current arranged overdraft is below \u00a3500, you will not pay any interest on the amount of your current overdraft limit. If you don\u2019t have an overdraft, or your limit is smaller than \u00a3500, you can request a new overdraft or an increased limit, but this will be subject to normal checks on affordability. \u2022 Credit records Anyone using these measures shouldn\u2019t have their credit record affected. The FCA said firms will be expected to \u201censure consumers using any of these temporary payment freeze measures will not have their credit file affected\u201d. \u2022 When banks can refuse The FCA has caveated its rules, saying there are situations where a lender can refuse a payment deferral. In its guidance, the FCA said: \u201cA firm should grant the customer a payment deferral for three months unless the firm determines (acting reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customer\u2019s interests to do so.\u201d The FCA added that it \u201cwould obviously not be in customers\u2019 interests if it would give [them] a greater overall debt burden compared to other solutions\u201d. In these instances, the bank is expected to offer other ways to help the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest, or extending the term of the loan. People with very high interest credit cards (usually those on the lowest incomes) who are suffering problems repaying may receive extra help. \u201cFirms should review their prices to consider whether they are consistent with the obligation to treat customers fairly in the light of the exceptional circumstances arising out of coronavirus in order to ensure that they do not pose unjustifiable burdens on these customers who may be experiencing temporary payment difficulties,\u201d said the FCA. \u2022 Timescales Customers who are struggling do not have to apply immediately \u2013 the FCA said they should be able to request a payment deferral at any point in the next three months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
