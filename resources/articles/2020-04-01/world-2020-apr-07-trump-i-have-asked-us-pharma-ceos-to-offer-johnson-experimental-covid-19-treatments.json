In an evening press briefing, Trump did not name the companies or the drugs, but earlier in the day he held a conference about therapeutic drugs with the heads of four US pharmaceutical and biotech companies: Amgen, Genetech, Gilead, and Regeneron. Trump has consistently promoted the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic azithromycin, as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the battle with coronavirus, although his own health officials have cautioned that there is no proof they are effective. \u201cI\u2019ve asked two of the leading companies ... They\u2019ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs \u2013 and I\u2019ve asked him to contact London immediately,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really advanced therapeutics \u2026 and they have arrived in London already. The London office has whatever they need. We\u2019ll see if we can be of help. We\u2019ve contacted all of Boris\u2019s doctors, and we\u2019ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve had meetings with the doctors, and we\u2019ll see whether or not they want to go that route,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in intensive care it\u2019s a big deal. So they\u2019re there and they\u2019re ready.\u201d Trump heaped praise on Johnson, who he has consistently seen as one of his closest allies. \u201cWe\u2019re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special: strong, resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d Asked by the Guardian whether the prime minister\u2019s initially relaxed approach to the pandemic may have been a mistake, Trump \u2013 who took a similar approach in the early weeks \u2013 replied cautiously. \u201cBoris was looking at it differently. He was looking at it earlier. He was looking at it like: ride it out. There were many people thinking about riding it out. Meaning, whatever it is, it is. But then you see what starts to happen, then the numbers become monumental, and they decided not to do that.\u201d Describing Monday\u2019s call with the four pharmaceutical company heads, the White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cWe are working hard to tear down barriers, cut red tape, &amp; encourage cooperation across private industries and government.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
