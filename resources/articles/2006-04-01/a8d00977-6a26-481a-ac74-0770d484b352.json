In his first match since leaving England's tour of India for personal reasons he could not prevent Somerset flirting with the prospect of an innings defeat. Trescothick was twice dismissed cheaply yesterday by Jonathan Lewis, in his first sally as Gloucestershire captain. Making skilful use of an early-season surface, Lewis returned championship-best figures of seven for 38 and then took three second-innings wickets. Gloucestershire took the extra half-hour but could not force a quick victory. That Somerset defied them owed everything to Cameron White, their Australian all-rounder. He followed a top score of 36 in the first innings with an unbeaten 154 from 193 balls, matching the hundred on his Somerset debut by his fellow Australian Ricky Ponting two years ago. Trescothick's day had less to commend it. He was out for 12 to the eighth ball of the morning, having added three to his overnight score, when Lewis had him leg before, half forward. He fell in identical fashion after lunch, his comeback amounting to 16 runs and 59 deliveries. Lewis bowled James Hildreth with a beauty to set the day in motion, Ian Harvey chipped at the middle order and Lewis returned to have Somerset nine down by lunch. A last-wicket stand of 32 was the highest of the innings as Charl Willoughby found consolation in Mark Hardinges' wayward medium. White, Victoria's captain at 22, must fear a bleak season. Daniel Cullen, another Australian batsman-spinner, is still to arrive, but the captain, Ian Blackwell, on enforced rest for this match, may well be summoned as a token spinner for the Test series against Sri Lanka. Matthew Wood, the stand-in captain, resisted briefly in the second innings before Lewis turned to the medium pace of Alex Gidman, who bowled him, John Francis having succumbed when Wood's straight drive brushed Steve Kirby's leg and ran him out. White cut crisply and played blissfully off his legs. He spent 15 balls on 99 but refused to grant Gloucestershire a three-day victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
