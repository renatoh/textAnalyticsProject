Yes, Lucy might have been a drug-hoovering, perma-shagging pain in the rear end, but that was no reason to snuff her out in her prime. So it\u2019s no surprise that even a pair of numpties like Ian and Peter soon realised that Jane was covering for lil\u2019 Bobby Beale, who\u2019d battered his stepsister with a jewellery box. Who says playing Minecraft doesn\u2019t build up those muscles, eh? The Beales were immersed in their faaaa-mily drama while Mick and Nancy were having a moment of father-daughter bonding of their own, figuring out how to dispose of Dean\u2019s body. Spangly Linda was in full poodle mode, proposing to the love of her life in front of a packed Queen Vic, oblivious to the fact that he\u2019d just bumped off her rapist in the beer cellar. Every cast member played a blinder, so much so that you could forget the whole episode was live and just concentrate on their pure misery. The daddy of the night was Ian (Adam Woodyatt), who swung from smashing up plates like he was holding a Greek wedding in the Beales\u2019 kitchen to throwing up (something of a trademark of these live scenes) and then pulling his family together to cover for Bobby. Little minx Cindy had never really had the chance to make anyone warm to her until tonight, but as she read out Lucy\u2019s last letter to her dad she broke the whole family and indeed the nation. What should have ended in tears over Ian\u2019s grief-stricken face at that moment strangely descended into a cheesy, frothing firework display in the Square, complete with Guetta-ised soundtrack. The cast breathed a sigh of relief, but anyone watching was still dwelling on Lucy\u2019s last hours. But at least it provided a backdrop to a beautiful bromantic interlude for Mick and Ian. \u201cYou alright?\u201d shouted Mick, over the fireworks as Phil shuffled furtively in the background. \u201cWe will be,\u201d replied Ian, in a way that suggested it might all be forgotten by next week. Cynics might argue that making Bobby the murderer was an anticlimax, especially if the Beales get away with sweeping it under the carpet, but there was so much more to Live Week than that. For the fans, it was everything it should have been, with birth, death, marriage and a whole lot of humour. Loyal viewers were rewarded with beautiful details, from the homage to \u2019Enders\u2019 first ever scene with the discovery of Nick Cotton\u2019s body, to Sonya\u2019s nod to her own Queen Vic delivery and of course Mick\u2019s \u201cGet outta my pub.\u201d The music for the first two episodes was strictly 1985 and the closing scenes of the live extravaganza paid tribute to the show\u2019s creators with the Julia and Tony graffiti. Through the darkness, there were flashes of humour, thanks to Kat\u2019s cake fight, the tease of Ian in a kilt and the look on Jo Joyner\u2019s face when she uttered the internet-breaking line: \u201cHow\u2019s Adam?\u201d EastEnders comes out of Live Week on top form, with a some very dangly loose ends to grab on to and some proper naughty tricks up its sleeve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
