As was exemplified by Manchester United spending lavishly on the potential of the teenager Anthony Martial and Arsenal hitting a brick wall in terms of buyable targets, it is a worrying trend from a European perspective. Football\u2019s band of A-list coaches spoke at length in search of ideas to rectify this problem. \u201cIt was one of the debates we had at the European managers meeting during the break,\u201d said Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \u201cThe strikers are South American today. Europe doesn\u2019t produce strikers any more.\u201d The shortage is so chronic that Arsenal\u2019s manager cannot recall a time when it was so difficult to find attackers of top quality. \u201cYou look at countries like Germany, who played in Scotland or against Poland with Mario G\u00f6tze up front \u2013 he\u2019s a creative midfielder. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because they do not want to play with a typical striker but they haven\u2019t got one who\u2019s really convincing at the top level. Who in Europe do you see? Spain won the [2010] World Cup with basically Cesc F\u00e0bregas as centre-forward. Germany now plays G\u00f6tze up front.\u201d So how do you break that cycle? Wenger believes player development has to change, to bring in more specialist positioning earlier in a young player\u2019s education. Modern methods seem to be churning out an endless supply of technical attacking midfielders (Wenger himself has established quite a collection). \u201cWhat I am convinced of is that in the academies we have to specialise the players,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThere is an age from five to 12 where you have the acquisition of the technical skills; at 12-14 you start to develop the speed and physical qualities; but from 14 onwards, when you start to position the players for their careers, maybe you have to work with specificity of a position again. Maybe we have to rethink completely the education and specialise earlier.\u201d Wenger is not convinced today\u2019s development strategies and luxuriously comfortable environments encourage the toughness that was traditionally part of the make-up of a powerful centre-forward or a robust centre-half. \u201cWhat we produce now are good technical players because there are nice pitches out there \u2013 before you played in the park where you had to kick the ball up front and you had to fight. A boy of 12 who played against a boy of 16 had to be shrewd and push to get the ball. All those kind of things have gone.\u201d The problem is exacerbated, he believes, because of the non-competitive vacuum the majority of young players find themselves in once they reach their late teens. \u201cOne of the biggest problems in the education at the academies is that you get them to the age of 19 and then what can you offer them? We lose many players because they stand there with nowhere to go. At that age, when you have no plan, you die. That is why I prefer to loan them out.\u201d Chuba Akpom, the youngster on loan at Hull this season, is an example of that. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Why do you loan them out because you could need them?\u2019 and it\u2019s true. But you have to make a decision at some stage with their career. They have to develop. \u201cYou have a generation of players who are lost between 18-20. When a guy of that age feels he doesn\u2019t move forward he loses motivation. And I am a bit scared about that because in France they play in Division Three with their reserves so you get competition against adults. In England you have created the under-21 league. I am not a fan of it because it is not the same as playing in competitive games. In many under-21 games there is no buildup before the game, there is not the pressure of the competition, there is not the results you have to stand up for. How many academies do you have in England? Twenty-six. Multiply that by 20 or 30, you have about 700 or 800 players every year that you produce. Where do they go? They cannot go in the Premier League.\u201d Having struggled to buy a centre-forward upgrade, and now having to contend with the prolonged absence of Danny Welbeck, Wenger is challenging his team to spread the goals around this season. \u201cI think Giroud, Walcott, S\u00e1nchez can get around 20 goals without any problem. Sometimes you have to trust your players and play them. Then they get there. People want always the absolute certainty that they will be absolutely successful. It is not like that. I played Anelka and people asked me: \u2018Why did you not buy anybody?\u2019 Thierry Henry the same. I said: \u2018Let him play, maybe he will score.\u2019 Football is a bit like that. It is not a science that everybody masters and can absolutely predict how many goals everybody will get. \u201cI would rather have Ramsey get 15, \u00d6zil 15, Cazorla 10. Otherwise, if you have only one player who scores, when he is injured you don\u2019t know who will score.\u201d After two home games without a goal this season, Wenger just needs somebody \u2013 anybody \u2013 to score on Saturday against Stoke to get the ball rolling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
