They don\u2019t usually mix the influences of post-punk, math rock and krautrock in their music. Neither do they stir in 70s Italian prog atmospheres, and a yowling lead singer, to make things stranger. But the most exciting new guitar band in Britain do this. A young, enigmatic London four-piece (two members are still in their teens), Black Midi don\u2019t really sound or act like anyone else. Their debut single, bmbmbm, was swaggering, atonal and stark, released on vinyl only last summer. It was also wilfully weird, featuring mangled samples of Big Brother contestant Nikki Grahame having tantrums in the diary room. The band\u2019s social media presence is minimal, which has helped their mystique. Earlier this year, they signed to Rough Trade after a bidding war. Black Midi\u2019s newly released debut album is called Schlagenheim, which translates from German as \u201chit home\u201d (the song titles \u2013 kept under wraps until last week - are minimalist, like Western, Ducter and Reggae). Live, the band are fantastic, harsh and direct. Singer Geordie Greep roams the stage in a greatcoat like a 21st-century Ian Curtis with a bouffant. Morgan Simpson won young drummer of the year in 2014; his style is frenetic and virtuosic. Cameron Picton and Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin add guitars and bass, their notes warping underneath many pressed pedals. Loud and bold on their terms, they\u2019ll soon be hard not to hear. \u2022 Schlagenheim is out now on Rough Trade. Black Midi play Nottingham Contemporary, 23 June; Rough Trade East, London, 25 June; White Hotel, Salford, 22 Oct and Fabric, London, 23 Oct"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
