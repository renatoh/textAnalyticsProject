The plan is being backed by leading figures such as Martina Navratilova - who is seeking to augment her all-time record of 332 titles by adding to her 19 Wimbledon triumphs next week - plus John McEnroe, the former French Open champion Guillermo Vilas and the BBC commentator John Barrett. They will put their proposal to the International Tennis Federation during Wimbledon. \"The future of the game is at stake,\" said the 46-year-old Navratilova. \"Interest in the game is waning. We need more surprises, more variety. Anything which makes it a better spectator sport would be a good thing.\" The idea is to bring back the subtlety seen in the game 25 years ago. A smaller racket would reduce the amount of top-spin the clay and hard-court specialists of Spain and South America can impart, making them mix things up with flatter shots and slices and come to the net more. It would mean that the vast majority of players - notably the Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt and the man he beat, the Argentinian David Nalbandian, and the French winner Juan Carlos Ferrero - would have to rely less on hitting from deep and more on classical strokes and variation. \"What we are seeking to do - making rackets smaller again - will change all the shots,\" Navratilova explained. \"The rackets, the way they are today, have helped ground strokes more than any other shot by a huge amount, exponentially. \"With smaller-headed rackets, ground strokes are going to need to be better because they won't create as much top-spin or pace. You won't be able to play 15 feet behind the baseline and it will require more skill.\" The current rules on racket sizes date from 1977 and specify maximums of string surfaces of 11.5in (width) and 15.5in (length), and frame 12.5in (overall width). The bigger the string surface the easier it is to generate top-spin, which makes the ball loop down and kick up, forcing players back, often beyond the baseline. The critics want the frame size eventually reduced to 9in. \"It could go from 12.5 to 11, perhaps in five years, and then from 11 to 10, and then to nine, as it used to be, maybe over seven years,\" said Barrett. Navratilova insists there is no need to alter the current materials, such as graphite and high-tech compounds. But Jon Ballardie, marketing manager of the equipment company Wilson, said: \"Pete Sampras won the US Open with one of our 85 sq in racket heads and Justine Henin won the French with one of 110. With a range like this there is a fair choice for everyone and we don't see the need to make any changes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
