A controversial VAR penalty means France are on the brink of qualifying from Group A. They\u2019ve got six points from their first two games and only need a point to be sure when they face Nigeria on Monday. Norway, who play South Korea in their final game, are level with Nigeria on three points. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. That\u2019s your lot! 90 min+1: Boe Risa makes way for Maanum. There will be four added minutes. 90 min: \u201cThe penalty was not harsh,\u201d Jan Schreuder says. \u201cIt was wrong. The Norwegian player hit the ball. The French player was late. That\u2019s why she was hit. She should have stepped out. Mistakes can be made but this decision is ridiculous after watching the VAR. I have no skin in the game except that I\u2019m in favor of the VAR and this makes it look ridiculous.\u201d 88 min: Cascarino wriggles into the area from the right, but her cross eludes everyone. 85 min: Gauvin makes way for Cascarino. 82 min: Bilbaut replaces Thiney 80 min: There\u2019s widespread agreement that the France penalty was very harsh. That\u2019s probably correct, though I was convinced they were going to get it as soon as the referee went to check on the screen. 78 min: \u201cAfter watching that VAR outcome I have vowed NEVER to watch another match,\u201d Stephen Scriven says. 77 min: Utland replaces Saevik for Norway. 74 min: I doubt the former Wales assistant manager is enjoying his evening. After a long wait Le Sommer keeps her nerve and drills a low penalty into the right corner. Hjelmseth goes the right way but she\u2019s beaten by the pace and accuracy. 71 min: It was unintentional but Engen did catch Torrent and France are awarded a VAR penalty. Norway are fuming. 70 min: It may well have been a foul by Engen, who caught Torrent on the thigh with a wild swing, though she did take the ball first. 69 min: VAR! VAR! VAR! They\u2019re checking for a penalty for France after a possible foul on Torrent. It might have been a foul by Engen. 68 min: There are a few whistles from the crowd. There\u2019s annoyance at Norwegian timewasting. \u201cIn the Germany-Spain match earlier today, a Spanish player became mysteriously indecisive in her own six yard box, contributing to Germany\u2019s winner,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cNow a French star has contrived another bizarre scene in the small area. It\u2019s turning out to be Six Yard Box Twilight Zone day.\u201d 66 min: Fight! Fight! Fight! \u201cI wonder if Mr. Lilley actually read my comment?\u201d Alan Kirkup says. \u201cI was at Old Trafford when Denis Law scored for Man City (a nice backheel) to send United down. I suggest he searches for the video. Class has no gender.\u201d 64 min: That own-goal\u2019s taken the wind out of France\u2019s sails. \u201cTo answer the question, how much is enough?\u201d David Farrelly says. \u201cFootball could do with an injection of mathematics, in much the same way that the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method is used in ODI cricket. A simple gaussian (normal distribution) could be used whose peak is the current average number of goals scored (in, say, a league or competition) and whose width is defined using the standard deviation. Depending on where the current match is on the distribution the level of celebration could be labelled as \u201cover the top\u201d, \u201cpeak\u201d, and \u201cmuted\u201d with possible sub-categories.\u201d 61 min: Good of them to tag her in the tweet. 58 min: Renard means \u201cfox\u201d in French. It was a real Francis Jeffers of a finish. 57 min: France break with Thiney leading the charge. Her pass is deflected into the path of Gauvin, who curls straight at Hjelmseth from 18 yards. 55 min: Le Sommer is booked. This is an absolute Djimi Traore from Renard. Hervolsen breaks down the left and rolls a cross into the six-yard box. Unfortunately no Norway attacker\u2019s there. Luckily Renard is. The France defender carefully taps the ball into the bottom corner from six yards out. What a finish. You can\u2019t be too careful in those positions. What a calamity! 53 min: Henry dances down the left, but her cross is headed over by Gauvin. 52 min: \u201cSeriously, Mr. Kirkup?\u201d Jeffrey Lilley says. \u201cNo one worries about lopsided results in the men\u2019s game. As long as goal differential is one of the tiebreakers, expect teams to score all they can. If the game is to henceforth be about \u201csportsmanship\u201d and not hurting your opponent\u2019s feelings, then I propose the game be played until the first goal is scored. So if a team scores in minute 1, so be it. If they score in minute 47, 88, or 120, so be it. Penalty kicks would be handled as normal after 2 extras. That way, the scoreline is always 1-0 or 0-0 (Team X on penalties) so everyone looks good and no one gets sad. In all seriousness? They\u2019re all professionals. They can deal with a lopsided loss. Don\u2019t try to put kiddie game rules into a professional competition, and don\u2019t criticize the women when you don\u2019t criticize the men.\u201d 51 min: There\u2019s been little response from Norway yet. 48 min: \u201cThirteen goals,\u201d Joshua Reynolds says. \u201cIt does make me wonder what number should the celebrations have stopped. Would the receive stick if they had just stoically walked back after scoring the fifth goal? The eighth? Where exactly is this line where you are celebrating too much?\u201d Le Sommer feeds Majri on the left. She takes no time at all to whip in a cross and Gauvin is more alert than Thorisdottir, allowing her to sweep a low shot past Hjelmseth. Gauvin, who\u2019s had some problems off the pitch, is delighted. That didn\u2019t take long! 46 min: Norway get the second half underway.And... Half-time reading Neither goalkeeper has had to make a serious save. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min: Majri slips inside on the left and curls a cross towards the far post. It\u2019s deflected wide for a corner. 41 min: Graham Hansen darts into the area from the right, but her shot from a tight angle isn\u2019t beating Bouhaddi at her near post. 40 min: \u201cI have no problem with winning 13-0 if that\u2019s your thing,\u201d Alan Kirkup says. \u201cI do have a problem with OTT celebrations, but again if that\u2019s your thing so be it. If the USWNT wanted to bring attention to themselves (and strangely to the competition as a whole) they did a brilliant job. However the target on the holders\u2019 backs just got a lot bigger. If they don\u2019t win this thing they\u2019ll have to take a whole lot of stick, and every neutral is now supporting whoever plays against them.\u201d 39 min: Diani swivels away from the gasping Minde again, but the France attacker ends up having to settle for a corner. Her end product has been lacking. 36 min: The quality has dipped a bit in the last few minutes. Both sides need to show more composure. Or maybe France could keep aiming crosses near the lamentable Hjelmseth. The Norway goalkeeper comes for another one, looking like she wants to punch it, and again she\u2019s flapping. The ball reaches Le Sommer, who pulls it back to Thiney. However the midfielder takes too long to shoot when the goal was unguarded. 34 min: Saevik skews a shot over from 18 yards. 31 min: Minde, who\u2019s had a tough half, lets a long ball drop over her head and through to Diani. The Norway left-back\u2019s lucky Diani can\u2019t do anything with he cross. 29 min: The impressive Diani surges clear on the right and for a moment it looks like she\u2019s going to shoot. Until she decides to cut it back to no one in particular, offering Norway a reprieve. 25 min: Majri crosses from the right. Hjelmseth comes for charging out for it, hands flapping, clown shoes on, and gets nowhere near it, the big galoot. Diabolical goalkeeping. Fortunately her team-mates bail her out, Minde bundling the ball behind when it\u2019s lofted into the six-yard box. Nothing comes from the corner. 24 min: The persistent Diani runs at Minde on the right, twisting this way and that, and drills a low ball into the middle. It\u2019s behind Gauvin but the striker tries a crafty backheel. Not crafty enough, though. Hjelmseth makes the save. 23 min: Le Sommer dribbles into space down the left, but her cross is poor. \u201cI\u2019ve no problem with the US scoring and celebrating 13 goals,\u201d Rob Coughlin says. \u201cThis is the World Cup, right? Men or women, it\u2019s the World Cup.\u201d 22 min: Diani scoots down the right and digs a cross into the middle. The ball bounces round the area, Norway doing their very best to present it to a France attacker, but eventually it\u2019s scrambled away. This is a decent game. 19 min: Diani drills a shot wide from 20 yards. 15 min: The second corner comes to nothing. \u201cAfter hearing all the criticism, I watched the highlights reel of the 13 goals scored by the USA, and it did leave a sore taste in my mouth,\u201d OB Jato says. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with anyone saying that they should have stepped off the gas after around their fifth goal (since that would have been even more disrespectful to the opposition), they were seemingly stuck in a FIFA game on the easy mode - scoring a goal every now and then, but celebrating with the same vigour even after their 13th goal! Giving the fans a good time is a good thing, but sometimes it can be too much of a good thing. Surely scoring an unlucky number of goals (13) won\u2019t come back to hurt them in the end?\u201d 14 min: The corner\u2019s sent into the near post by Reiten. Engen glances it towards goal but it\u2019s deflected over by a French defender. That was a crucial touch. It was probably heading in. 13 min: Norway exert a strong press on the right and Seivik wins possession off Majri. Hervolsen runs at Renard and wins a corner. 11 min: Norway are growing in confidence. They probe down the left, Reiten whipping in another cross. France are dozing a little and Saevik arrives at the far post, only to knee wide. 10 min: A brief stoppage while one of the assistant referees sort out a faulty flag. Turns out she needs a new one and we have to wait a while for one to arrive. Sort it out Fifa! 8 min: France get themselves in a tangle at the back, Mbock Bathy unable to deal with the bustling presence of Herlovsen as they chase a long ball. Herlovsen comes out on top, muscling the France centre-back out the way, and Bouhaddi has to sprawl from her line to confront the Norway forward. The goalkeeper\u2019s unconvincing, though, and again Herlovsen is too strong. At one point Bouhaddi looks like she\u2019s about to knock the striker over. Instead the ball squirms clear on the left and Herlovsen turns and sends in a cross that drifts out of play. 7 min: Norway have crept out of their own half. They\u2019ll need to work hard to deal with this early French flurry. The home fans are also making a lot of noise. 5 min: It\u2019s a typically fast start from France, the kind that suggests they were sniffing raw steak just before emerging from the dressing room. They win another corner, this time on the right, but Henry can\u2019t do anything with Majri\u2019s deep delivery. 4 min: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a 13-0 scoreline, I suppose, but it would have caused a great deal more gaiety and cheer in the world had the USA been on the 0 side of it,\u201d Charles Antaki says. 2 min: The brilliant Le Sommer charges down the left and whacks a cross into the area. It\u2019s only half cleared and Norway panic a little when a ricochet takes the ball back into the path of Henry. But she\u2019s offside when she shoots wide. No need to fret. Peep! France, in their dark blue, get the game underway in Nice. Norway, all in white, immediately concede a free-kick on the left. Thiney\u2019s fizzing delivery is dangerous, but Diani can\u2019t connect at the far post. The teams are out. Time for the anthems! A decent record ... Hands up for the warmup ... It\u2019s the generation game ... France: Bouhaddi, Torrent, Mbock, Renard, Majri, Bussaglia, Henry, Diani, Thiney, Le Sommer, Gauvin Norway: Hjelmseth, Moe Wold, Mjelde, Thorisdottir, Minde, S\u00e6vik, B\u00f8e Risa, Engen, Reiten, Graham, Herlovsen Hello. I believe in 13-0! I believe in 13-0! I believe in 13-0! Ok, maybe not this evening. This one\u2019s unlikely to be a horrible mismatch. France were quick, slick and strong in their opening game against South Korea, but the hosts will face a stern test against the tough Norwegians, who made light of the absence of Ada Hegerberg demonstrating their threat with a thumping 3-0 win over Nigeria. This one could decide who wins Group A and it promises to be tight, tense and thoroughly entertaining, which is exactly what I deserve after sitting through Argentina 0-0 Japan the other day.
