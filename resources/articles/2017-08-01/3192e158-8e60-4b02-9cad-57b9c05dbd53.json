I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re asking me. We won\u2019t have that problem", "bodyText": "One by one the stars from sport and screen paid sweet homage to Usain Bolt, each homily more doe-eyed than the last. First Asafa Powell thanked him \u201con behalf of the Jamaican people\u201d. Then soapy tributes from Cara Delevingne, Thierry Henry and Virat Kohli were relayed on a giant screen. And when Idris Elba appeared to tell him \u201cI am so impressed with you, brother; you are an exemplary athlete and an amazing human being\u201d the impression that the Brewery in London was hosting a revivalist meeting not an athletics press conference was complete. Fortunately Samuel L Jackson turned out to be not only coarser but more heartfelt. \u201cHey Usain,\u201d he said, chuckling away. \u201cThanks for all the thrills, thanks for all the chills. Thanks for being the outstanding dope-ass motherfucker you have always been.\u201d The man who has won eight Olympic gold medals, 11 world titles and broken six world records during a glittering career responded to this unbending faith with an appreciative smile, and a humbled reply. \u201cIt is great to be recognised by great people\u201d. But no one recognised Bolt\u2019s greatness \u2013 in what was his last media appearance before the world athletics championships begin in London on Friday \u2013 more than the event\u2019s compere Colin Jackson. At one point the former 110m world record holder told him: \u201cYou say you are a legend \u2013 when other athletes do that they sound really arrogant, you don\u2019t. How do you do that?\u201d At another Jackson admitted that come the 100m final on Saturday, which will be Bolt\u2019s last individual race before he retires, \u201cthere may be tears in the stadium, and I may be one of them\u201d. True, Bolt\u2019s press conferences are always a little quirky. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, for instance, he was asked his thoughts on the Palestine question \u2013 while at the Rio Olympics a Norwegian reporter told Bolt he loved him before rapping at him. But rarely do they start out this sycophantic. Yet when questions were finally allowed from the hundreds of journalists from around the world, a steelier side to the Jamaican emerged. For the most part he was playful, intelligent and thoughtful. Yet when he was questioned about perhaps his biggest rival for 100m gold, Andre De Grasse, he bared his teeth. It started when the Jamaican was asked who might fill his shoes when he retires. \u201cI am not going down that road,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe last guy who I said was going to be great disrespected me. So I am not going to say who is going to be great.\u201d To many that was clearly a pointed reference to De Grasse, the young Canadian who won a 100m bronze and a 200m silver behind Bolt at last year\u2019s Olympics and has run a wind-assisted 9.69sec this season. Last year they appeared good friends. However since then De Grasse has upset the Jamaican by saying \u201ceveryone knows he\u2019s slowing down a little bit\u201d \u2013 and by claiming Bolt deliberately booted him out of a 100m race in Monaco because he was too dangerous an opponent. Relations have been the frosty side of Siberian since. When asked about his relationship with De Grasse, Bolt feigned disinterest. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI see him around. I say \u2018hi\u2019. That is it, I guess. I don\u2019t know how to describe that. I don\u2019t have his phone number or anything. We just say \u2018hi\u2019.\u201d Later, when it was put to Bolt that the Canadian might be his biggest challenger in the 100m final, he merely shrugged his shoulders. \u201cThe seven people that are going to be in that race with me,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey are my best challengers.\u201d The questioner persisted. Where did he see De Grasse\u2019s career going in the future? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the past he has won a bronze medal, won a silver medal, we\u2019ll see what happens in the future, it\u2019s all about consistency.\u201d Each time he responded the same message came across: this is an athlete desperate not to tarnish his legacy with a defeat in his final major championships. Yet Bolt \u2013 rightly \u2013 believes that he remains the man to beat; and the one the world will be hailing again after the final. Indeed, when a Jamaican journalist dared to ask what would happen if he lost, he shook his head in shock that a fellow countryman would ever contemplate such a thing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re asking me that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t have that problem, don\u2019t worry about it. \u201cThe last 100m I ran was a 9.95sec so it shows I\u2019m going in the right direction,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not worried. It\u2019s a championship, so it\u2019s about who can keep their nerve. I\u2019ve been here many a time so I know I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s just go time, so let\u2019s go.\u201d The press conference concluded with Bolt being presented with a new pair of purple and gold spikes by his sponsors. \u201cMy school colours were purple and that\u2019s where it started,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe gold is straightforward \u2013 I\u2019m the golden boy.\u201d Despite his protestations of being an underdog in London, few doubt that he will lose that tag any time soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
