Ndombele was signed by Mourinho\u2019s predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, for a club-record \u00a355m last summer but, hampered by injuries, he has had a stop-start season. Mourinho has started the midfielder only six times in all competitions since taking over last November and, post-shutdown, has left him as an unused substitute against Manchester United and West Ham. Before Thursday\u2019s visit to Sheffield United, Mourinho would only say that Ndombele would be in the squad and, based on recent evidence, it is clear the Frenchman is fourth in the central midfield pecking order behind Moussa Sissoko, Harry Winks and Giovani Lo Celso. Mourinho has been critical of Ndombele, namely about his fitness, but retains faith in the player\u2019s ability. The manager recalled how Modric, whom he took from Spurs to Real in 2012, endured such a torrid start he was voted by Marca readers as the worst La Liga signing of the season. Modric would go on to win four Champions League titles with Real, one league title and also be named as the player of the 2018 World Cup with Croatia. \u201cI believe Ndombele can turn it around,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cFootball is full of players who have made difficult starts and then ended well. When Modric arrived at Real Madrid, after six months he was labelled the worst signing in their history. So when the talent is there many things can happen with adaptation. \u201cIn many other clubs it looks like it\u2019s normal to have great players on the bench: United, Liverpool, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich. At Tottenham I feel is every time a top player is on the bench, it\u2019s a drama. The players and everybody else have to understand it\u2019s not a drama. \u201cI hope next season we have even more top players on the bench because it means we have to be bigger than where we are now. No problem with Tanguy, no story. We are a big club with very talented players.\u201d Mourinho was asked how Ndombele felt about his season at Spurs. \u201cThat\u2019s a question for him,\u201d he replied. \u201cI know him for six months and six months is not enough to find or describe his psychological profile. One thing is feelings, another is the reality. I am not a genius to within six months get inside a person\u2019s brain, to describe 100% his feelings.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
