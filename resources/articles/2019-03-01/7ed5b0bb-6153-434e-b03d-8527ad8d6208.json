The Mini Le Chiquito is a small-scale version of Jacquemus\u2019s Le Chiquito bag, a runaway hit for autumn/winter 18. The minuscule bags were initially sent out as invitations to the brand\u2019s show and weren\u2019t for sale, but they did point towards a developing \u2013 or shrinking \u2013 trend in accessories. When it comes to bags, petite purses rule this season. Forget micro \u2013 it\u2019s all about the nano. The Mini Le Chiquito, with room to hold little more than a couple of mints or a single AirPod earphone, looked like a joke \u2013 but then French fashion house Louis Vuitton launched its own nano bag, designed to hold no more than a lipstick. With a long chain, and described as an \u201celegant homage to 1920s makeup boxes\u201d, it is available in two colours \u2013 both currently sold out online. Last month, in Milan, Prada also showcased mini pouch bags \u2013 which might struggle to hold more than an iPhone \u2013 worn on straps around ankle boots. The proliferation of micro bags has been interpreted as a signifier of status: there is nothing glamorous about lugging your worldly possessions round in an oversized sack. Carrying next to nothing implies that someone else is doing your heavy lifting. On the high street last summer this translated into everything from small sporty bumbags to petite beaded grab bags at retailers including Asos, Topshop and Zara. But is the extension of this trend into \u201cnano\u201d territory a sign of (even smaller) things to come, or just a marketing gimmick? \u201cSmall is certainly beautiful when the impact and the conversation are so big and spread so far, as we have seen this week for the Jacquemus micro bag,\u201d says Jane Allan, a consultant at PR agency Borkowski. \u201cThe bags have the novelty factor, which makes them instantly Instagrammable. Brand value is amplified as soon as the fashion pack join in. In turn, this leads to awareness spreading of the brand without them investing a penny on marketing. Clever.\u201d It has not been made clear if the Mini Le Chiquito bag will be available to buy, but designer Simon Porte\u2019s vision appears to extend beyond marketing ploys. Speaking to the Observer in Paris last month, he said: \u201cI wanted to show the arty and conceptual mood I had at the beginning [of my career].\u201d That the trend for nano bags might have a place on the high street \u2013 which is traditionally more interested in \u201cwearable\u201d than \u201cconceptual\u201d when it comes to fashion \u2013 is not beyond the realms of possibility. In an increasingly cashless economy, many shoppers are finding they need to carry little more than a cardholder on a strap. Given this and the resurgence of gowns with pockets \u2013 such as Gemma Chan\u2019s Valentino dress at the Oscars, worn by Max Mara models in Milan, and even for brides \u2013 bigger bags could soon become redundant. \u201cYou could argue that a small bag has that Marie Kondo answer to simplicity,\u201d says Allan. \u201cThe less you carry, the further you travel. Perhaps it makes us think more about what\u2019s important.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
