Spent their lives toiling in thinktanks, producing earnest tracts for politicians who never understood them: now those idiots will have to listen. Leading lights: Michael Gove (ex- Times columnist) left; Greg Clark (ex-policy chief at central office); anyone wearing glasses. Likes: Googling obscure websites. Dislikes: Pinstripes, prejudice (universally white and male, but insist the party shouldn't be). When they grow up... They'll be David \"Two Brains\" Willetts. The Mavericks Driven by: Joie de vivre. Either incomprehensibly posh or dead common, they are rollicking company, hold passionate if sometimes eccentric views, and will keep newspapers in gaffes for years to come. Leading lights: Andrew Pelling, left, (berated by the Daily Mail for leaving his wife for a 24-year-old activist); anyone not wearing their pager. Likes: 'Witty' ties, good lunches. Dislikes: Tabloid journalists on the doorstep. When they grow up... They'll be Ken Clarke if they're lucky: Eric Forth if not. The Media Darlings Driven by: Rave reviews. Blessed with the right 'look', they are young, go-getting, and dubbed rising stars before they even got elected - now must prove there's more to them than hype. Leading lights: Justine Greening, right, (attractive blonde who won Putney); Adam Afriyie (first black Tory MP); anyone wearing heavy makeup 'for TV'. Likes: Soundbites. Dislikes: Losing. When they grow up... They want to be Michael Portillo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
