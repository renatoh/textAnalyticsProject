The BOA will find out later this month whether the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) will uphold its appeal against Wada's decision to find its lifetime ban non-compliant with its global code. Most experts expect the court to find in favour of Wada, opening the door for the suspended David Millar and Dwain Chambers to compete at the Games. At the same time, Wada is currently seeking submissions for its ongoing code review, due to be implemented in 2013. In its submission, the BOA argues for a four-year ban as the starting point for athletes who have cheated. \"There is no issue of greater importance in protecting the health and well-being of athletes, and the integrity of sport, than the fight against doping. It is right that Wada is leading a worldwide consultation process, but far more must be done,\" said the BOA chairman Lord Moynihan, who is in Moscow this week for a meeting of the Association of National Olympic Committees. \"By urging NOCs to work toward a global two year ban in recent years, Wada has followed the wrong course. As Sir Steve Redgrave, one of our greatest Olympians, has said: 'A two-year ban for doping is almost saying it is acceptable.'\" Moynihan said a four-year ban should be the starting point, with reductions possible if it could be proved the substance had not been taken intentionally. \"It should not, however, be possible for an individual to escape a four-year ban simply through an admission of guilt. Much more substantial assistance should be needed to justify a reduction where circumstances should otherwise dictate that a four-year ban is appropriate,\" he added. The BOA has also argued in its submission for Wada to include a clause in its code that bans athletes convicted of serious doping offences from the Olympics or equivalent major championships that follows. The BOA is in effect arguing for the International Olympic Committee's \"Osaka rule\", struck out by the CAS earlier this year as an \"additional sanction\" following a challenge from the US athlete LaShawn Merritt, to be integrated within the code. Last month, the UK Anti-Doping Agency also called for stronger sanctions in its submission to the Wada code review. But it said a mandatory four-year ban could weaken the case for the principle of \"strict liability\", which makes athletes responsible for any substance found in their bodies. Instead, it proposed more flexibility around the length of the ban that could be applied so that it could push for longer sanctions for intentional, serious doping offences. Moynihan renewed his attack on Wada, which prompted a spat between the two organisations earlier this year, when the BOA chairman strongly criticised the global anti-doping agency in a speech. \"Proceeding as if yesterday's strategies will be sufficient in ensuring a level playing field for the athletes of today and tomorrow is a recipe for failure,\" he said. \"Relying on outdated testing methodology and practices that are primarily reactive in nature is not, in our view, the way forward. Now is the time for Wada to take a fresh look at how it goes about fulfilling its important mandate, and indeed, how it is organised and operates, to ensure it is delivering in a manner truly befitting the world's athletes and the millions of pounds in public funding with which it is entrusted annually.\" Wada argues that it is already moving towards the intelligence-based approach advocated by Moynihan and has called his criticisms \"ill informed\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
