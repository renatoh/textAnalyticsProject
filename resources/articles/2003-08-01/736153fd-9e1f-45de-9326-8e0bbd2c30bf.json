The preparations of the Bedford runner for the 10,000 metres in Paris have been disrupted by bronchitis and a shin injury over the past two months. Radcliffe, who broke her own world marathon record when winning the London Marathon in April for the second consecutive year, had already missed nine days' training on top of the time she was sidelined during June because of a leg injury. But she has since avoided any further problems and the signs point to her making the trip in an effort to win her first major global title on the track. Radcliffe has been working hard at altitude in Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees where she has flown her physical therapist Gerhard Hartmann from Limerick to oversee her training. Hartmann is always by Radcliffe's side before her major races and she trusts his judgment about whether she is in shape to run well. British runners who have recently been training with Radcliffe, including her clubmate Liz Yelling and British marathon international Jo Lodge, also report that she has been in high spirits and that her training has been going well. The fact that Radcliffe has not competed since London is also unlikely to be an handicap as last year, following a serious period out through illness, she came back and in her first race ran the fifth fastest 3,000m ever. Radcliffe's participation would be a major boost for a team who have once again been bedevilled by injuries which has cost them some of their major medal hopes, including the triple jumper Ashia Hansen and the decathlete Dean Macey. Jonathan Edwards is also refusing to give up on being in Paris to defend his world triple jump title despite suffering what appeared to be a serious ankle injury during the Norwich Union London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace last Friday. \"Like many things it looked worse than it actually was,\" said the world record holder. \"Now it's a case of wait and see how things are going.\" A decision is expected later in the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
