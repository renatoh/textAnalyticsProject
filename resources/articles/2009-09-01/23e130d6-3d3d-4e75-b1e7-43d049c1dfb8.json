I appreciate this is probably still too raw a subject for Arsenal fans but when they get over it, in about March 2012, say, they too will realise the midfielder's winner for Manchester United went beyond the bog-standard and frankly blameless deflections that make up the majority of the genre. The best own goals, the ones that elicit a \"wahey\" instead of a \"whoops\", are made special by the nonchalance of the practitioner in the seconds before his downfall. Watch Diaby's face as he leaps to head Ryan Giggs's cross and he looks absolutely assured of his intentions. It was no brainstorm. He had the confidence to make an intervention but cocked up the execution so bewilderingly that he was left as dumbfounded as his team\u2011mates. It was that initial air of complete conviction, and the contrast with his crestfallen countenance seconds later that enhanced the goal's comic potential. Many of the outstanding examples of the game's self-inflicted wounds came from the pre-Premier League age when the backpass law had not been amended to test goalkeepers' ability to kick. Back then there was no better way to take the sting out of a game than to roll the ball back to the keeper who would calmly pick it up, bounce it a couple of times then punt it upfield. As full\u2011time approached this became a fairly regular occurrence from a side with a narrow lead, but occasionally the tactic backfired in astonishing fashion and punctured the pride of the protagonist. Among those with egg on their faces were Willie Donachie, who was playing for Scotland against Wales in a Home International at Hampden Park in 1978 when he received an underarm throw from the goalkeeper, Jim Blyth, with more than 90 minutes gone and his team 1-0 up. Unchallenged in the left-back position and with the visitors seemingly resigned to their fate, Donachie, inexplicably, hit the ball first-time with his right foot with the requisite amount of pace to creep a foot inside Scotland's left post. In 1975 the late Keith Weller added panache to his finish when, from the right touchline, he stopped and curled one beyond Mark Wallington during Leicester City's 3-0 defeat by Luton. Both incidents provoked the scorers to put their heads in their hands but you wouldn't be surprised to find that behind their finger-masks they were wryly smiling in bemusement. The opposition fans were doing a bit more than smiling but what makes these kind of mistakes so cherishable is that they bring professional footballers off their plinths to reveal they are as prone to error as the rest of us. Look at Diaby's languid running and classy passing and those sort of skills are unattainable for the average fan. Watch him skew a header past his goalkeeper when under little pressure and you think \"I could do that\". Lapses make it easier to identify with players. Notable serial transgressors include Liverpool's Jamie Carragher, the Portsmouth manager, Paul Hart, who began his spell at Leeds with a debut own goal, and Frank Sinclair. The latter's greatest effort, for Leicester against Middlesbrough in 2002, was a 35-yard blast past his own goalkeeper that put even Lee Dixon's long-range chip over David Seaman in the shade. Both were the equivalent of watching someone walk straight into a plate-glass door \u2013 the look of perplexity that precedes embarrassment, and the loss of dignity, is the root of slapstick comedy. For the ultimate pratfall laced with hubris nothing comes close to Jamie Pollock's goal for QPR when playing for Manchester City in 1998. Crazy never came into the ball juggling run and looping header past Martyn Margetson \u2013 it was a work of destructive brilliance. Happy memories for Liverpool fans of Delfi Geli's golden goal that handed them the Uefa Cup in 2001 and for Leeds fans of Brian Gayle's in their penultimate match of the 1991-92 season that effectively won them the title are tempered by what happened to Andr\u00e9s Escobar \u2013 murdered in 1994 after putting through his own net during Colombia's World Cup game against the USA. The joy the own goal creates has never been as pure since that monstrous outrage. The rare occasions, however, when too-clever-by-half players are spectacularly chagrined can still be moments to savour, as poor Diaby acknowledged with a look of utter deflation that was as close to someone wearing a custard pie you're going to get this side of the Chuckle Brothers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
