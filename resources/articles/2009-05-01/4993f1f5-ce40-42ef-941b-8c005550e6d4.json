Mark Viduka looked in the mood while Obafemi Martins, full of athleticism and endeavour, raced around him. A Martins volley and header, a goalline clearance by Carlos Cuellar from Duff and a splendid last-minute block by Brad Friedel summed up Newcastle's determination to get the vital first goal. By comparison Villa were sluggish, attempting to get the ball to their front men with longer, more ambitious passes when they regained possession deep. But they knew their strength was their counter-attacking ability and they quickly exploited it. Whenever Duff moved forward Villa instantly sought out the space between the centre-back, Fabricio Coloccini, and the touchline. Gabriel Agbonlahor continually looked to run into this area but, to Coloccini's credit, in the early stages he stuck with the Villa man's pace. On the other flank Edgar had little cover and on four occasions Ashley Young and Gareth Barry cut in at will. The youngster was having a difficult afternoon. In Young's case, his final ball continued not to match his clever body movements. The goal was unluckily conceded on 38 minutes but had nothing to do with tactics and everything to do with the confidence of the best player of the first half, Barry. He was prepared to have a shot in a tight spot when others might not have tried. One expected a second-half resumption of intensity from Newcastle that matched their opening efforts but they looked physically second best as if the heat, tension and the season's desperate efforts had all been too much. A flurry of substitutions did nothing to help their cause. As the game progressed their front trio became narrow and Michael Owen, introduced too late, Martins and Shola Ameobi all played centrally letting Cuellar and Curtis Davies cope comfortably with the predictable balls that came out of Newcastle's defence. Edgar was weary and eventually sent off. Nicky Butt found the recovery running difficult as Barry, Stilian Petrov, Agbonlahor and Young showed great energy and more desire. Consequently Friedel had no worrying moments in the second half. The Villa tactics of thrusting the ball down the flanks behind Newcastle's full-backs continued to succeed. Barry, Young and John Carew all could or should have scored. It was difficult for the visitors to protect themselves while trying to create the chance to equalise. The full-backs needed to push forward and supply crucial midfield width but they failed in this aspect and were also exploited as they sacrificed too much grass to Young, Agbonlahor and Carew. Villa's strike force eagerly occupied the vacated territory, making life awkward for Coloccini and Steven Taylor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
