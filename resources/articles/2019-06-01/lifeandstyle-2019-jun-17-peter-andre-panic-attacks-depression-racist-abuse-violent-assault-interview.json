This was at the peak of his early fame, when he couldn\u2019t have appeared more confident in his own skin \u2013 a sun-kissed, six-packed beefcake singing cheesy songs. He had made his name in the UK with the reggae single Mysterious Girl, had two No 1 hits (Flava and I Feel You), and four that reached the Top 10. \u201cThat\u2019s when the panic attacks started,\u201d he says. For six years, no one heard a thing from him. He became so invisible, so swiftly, that radio shows ran Have You Seen Peter Andre? competitions. Now he is a boyish 46 \u2013 black hair and stubble, not an ounce of fat on him, wearing his skinny jeans with conviction. We meet in a London hotel where he is promoting Grease the Musical. Andre is playing the Teen Angel \u2013 his first theatrical performance since he was a 17-year-old in Australia. But he also has a lot to say about reality TV and mental health, two subjects he knows a lot about. It was on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here that he met the former glamour model Katie Price, they married on their reality show, their children Junior and Princess Tiaamii grew up on reality TV, and he started a new chapter on his own reality show after their divorce. Reality TV allowed him to reinvent himself after a breakdown, gave him a huge profile, considerable wealth and a second chance at celebrity. So when he says reality TV can be dangerous, it\u2019s worth listening. For the best part of two decades he has been on and off medication, in and out of therapy, trying to understand the roots of his mental health problems. Only recently, he says, have the panic attacks stopped. He thinks it all goes back to his early years in Australia. Andre was born in Harrow, north-west London, to Greek-Cypriot parents. When he was six, the family emigrated to Australia \u2013 first Sydney, then the Gold Coast when Andre was nine. That is when the problems started. \u201cWhen I moved to the Gold Coast, we were the only ethnic family I knew. It was all blond-haired, blue-eyed Australians. At school one day they tied me to the fence and took turns throwing stones to see who was going to hit me in the head. I was petrified.\u201d He says it was pointless going to the teachers because they were just as bad. \u201cI remember a teacher saying to me: \u2018Listen here, you greasy wog, if you think you\u2019re going to do well in my class, you\u2019ve got another think coming. You sit in the back corner. I don\u2019t want to see your face.\u2019 That\u2019s how they talked. The teachers!\u201d Years later, he met the teacher again. \u201cI actually gave him a hug. And he said: \u2018Listen mate, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u2019\u201d Didn\u2019t you want to hit him \u2013 or at least remind him? \u201cNo. I had no grudge against him because I knew that\u2019s what it was like back then.\u201dPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising that one of Andre\u2019s favourite films is The Truman Show \u2013 the movie starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a 29-year-old oblivious to the fact that his life is a reality show. Unlike Truman, of course, Andre chose to be a reality star and has cashed in on it. But like Truman, Andre is an innocent in a cynical world \u2013 sweet, trusting and desperately sincere. His teen years were happy. At 16, he appeared on Australia\u2019s New Faces and was offered a contract, live on TV. He had a Top 3 hit, supported Madonna on tour and became a household name in Australia. Then, in his early 20s, he was attacked by a stranger. \u201cThis guy grabbed me in a nightclub in Sydney. He pushed me into the bathroom, pulled out a knife and put it on my neck, and said: \u2018Give me a reason I shouldn\u2019t finish you off.\u2019 He kept picking at me with the knife.\u201d Eventually, he let Andre go. \u201cHe said: \u2018You better watch your every step because when we decide the time\u2019s right, we\u2019re going to finish you.\u2019\u201d Andre says that for every fan, there was somebody who hated him. He moved to the UK, where he enjoyed his greatest success. But the anxiety never left him. Then, in 1998, the panic attacks began. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I ended up in hospital, and the panic attacks would come one after another. Years later, after therapy, I realised it all stemmed from that fear of being killed.\u201d He comes to a stop. \u201cI know it sounds dramatic,\u201d he says. Andre told his manager Claire Powell \u2013 who is in the hotel room with us \u2013 that he needed a break. He returned to his parents in Australia, said he was fine but knackered, and stayed in bed for months. Eventually, he headed off to the US, telling his family he was going to make a record. Actually, he was going there to hide. And this time he really did disappear. Not even Powell knew where he was. Finally she came across him one night in a restaurant. \u201cHe came over to the table and it was the most bizarre thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d given my life to making him famous in England. Then I\u2019d just not seen him. It was like, oh my God, how has this bloody happened? And he just didn\u2019t seem the same dynamic guy he was.\u201d Powell gradually coaxed him back to work. In 2004, after six years away, he was invited to be on I\u2019m a Celebrity. Powell told him it could be good for him, and it was \u2013 he met Price, and the TV audience loved him. When he emerged from the jungle, Mysterious Girl had been rereleased and was No 1. The whole thing was unbelievable, he says. What strikes me as most unbelievable, I say, is that you chose to return from a massive breakdown by exposing yourself on a reality show. He says things were different back then. He didn\u2019t know anything about reality shows, and there was an innocence to them. \u201cThey said it was a challenge show like Survivor and I thought it may help me overcome my fears.\u201d If you\u2019d just had a breakdown now, would you go straight into reality TV? He shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d But he was lucky, he says \u2013 he had good management. He looks at Powell. \u201cWhen I came out I had her, I had my family. If I was left to my own devices I don\u2019t know where I would have gone. Reality really helped me and there\u2019s no way I could say otherwise.\u201d It certainly helped make his relationship with Price. Ultimately, though, does he think it was partially responsible for breaking it? \u201cOh, I won\u2019t talk about this at all.\u201d For a long time he and Price made a fortune from pulling up the blinds on their private life. Now Andre simply says he has promised Junior and Princess that he will not talk about their mother publicly. When he went on I\u2019m a Celebrity, he was still in pieces. He came out a born-again star. But he was still a mess. Four months after leaving the jungle, he released his first album in seven years, The Long Road Back. Powell reminds him of the state he was in when that came out. \u201cWe were at a hotel and you wouldn\u2019t come out of your room because it hadn\u2019t gone into the Top 3. Do you remember?\u201d \u201cI was going through a really difficult time,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, but I remember saying: \u2018Come on!\u2019 I was actually talking to you under the door.\u201d \u201cYou can go a number of ways when this happens,\u201d Andre says. \u201cOne person might turn to the alternate reality \u2013 drugs. My parents were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, very anti-drugs, I didn\u2019t want to break their hearts. You\u2019ve got the option of doing therapy or doing nothing and just hoping it\u2019s going to sort itself out, or you can top yourself.\u201d Did he ever want to kill himself? \u201cI got to some very dark points where I remember praying to God, please get me through this day, just to get through one more day. That\u2019s how bad it got.\u201d In the end, it was medication and therapy that helped. Last month, Andre appeared to defend Jeremy Kyle after his show was axed following the suspected suicide of a guest. Now he says his comments were misinterpreted. The point he was trying to make was that Kyle was being unfairly singled out. \u201cI thought: what about all these other shows \u2013 Love Island, for example \u2013 where people have died? They were attacking Jeremy Kyle because his name is attached to the show. There has to be a duty of care across the networks. It\u2019s not just one person or one show.\u201d It is only a couple of weeks since a suicide verdict was recorded at the inquest for the former Love Island contestant Mike Thalassitis. Last year another Love Island star, 32-year-old Sophie Gradon, also took her own life. Andre says questions have to be asked about whether such shows are providing adequate support. \u201cLook at a guy like Mike Thalassitis,\u201d he says. \u201cI only met him once or twice, Greek guy, 26 years old, looked in peak condition, good-looking guy, and he went and took his own life because of mental health. Twenty-six years old!\u201d He stops, appalled. He talks about the contestants who spend months dieting for a show, come out and put on weight, and are ripped apart on social media. Then there are those in constant demand until the next season, when they are discarded as reality relics. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall into some sort of depression if you\u2019ve got one ounce of weakness, which we all have. You\u2019re going to fall.\u201d Was it right or wrong to take Kyle off air? \u201cIt is the most horrific thing that somebody took their own life, we cannot forget that. What I do think is if they are taking that show off, they should be taking a lot of shows off.\u201d What else would you take off? \u201cAny show where there is a reality side. I think they\u2019re all great shows in their own way, but what about the people who have left The Voice or The X Factor who have been devastated because they\u2019ve been told they\u2019re rubbish, and it drives them to drink? You\u2019ve got to go across the board if you\u2019re going to do this. You can\u2019t single out.\u201d What\u2019s the answer? \u201cThey need to look at the whole thing. They need to analyse who\u2019s going on these shows. They should be checked before they go on, they should be talked to after. They should know whether they\u2019re in the right frame of mind to do that sort of thing. How are they going to cope with pressure? They can\u2019t just go, OK, that person looks good. Look at a show like The Undateables. It\u2019s a good show in that it shows that people who are classed as undateable can actually date, but there\u2019s vulnerability there. We need to really care before and after. And I tell you, it\u2019s very easy after to go, right, next! Who are we finding next?\u201d Four years ago, Andre got married for the second time, to Emily MacDonagh, a doctor 17 years younger than him. As with Price, they met in bizarre circumstances. In 2010, Andre had emergency surgery to remove a kidney stone. As a thank you, he gave his surgeon a couple of tickets for one of his shows. The surgeon couldn\u2019t make it, so he passed the tickets on to his student daughter Emily. Now he and Emily have two children \u2013 five-year-old Millie and Theo, two. Andre says Emily is determined the children should lead normal lives. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want Theo and Millie in the public eye at all, which I respect because they weren\u2019t born into it. Junior and Princess were born into it.\u201d Do they miss being on television? \u201cYou know, we never really talked about it. I always looked at it when we were filming that we were making fantastic home videos that we\u2019d have for ever. But we still do those videos. We just capture them on our phones now.\u201d So much of his life has been documented, and surprising footage continues to emerge. In March, a scene in Leaving Neverland, the documentary about Michael Jackson and sexual abuse, showed an 11-year-old Andre in the background. He had finished runner-up in a dancing competition where the prize was to meet Michael Jackson. The winner, Wade Robson, alleged Jackson went on to sexually abuse him. Robson was only five years old \u2013 officially you had to be seven to enter the competititon. If he had been disqualified, Andre would have won. Does Andre think: there but for the grace of God? No, he says, he still adores Jackson and does not want to believe he was an abuser. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking: could it have happened? Of course. And if it did, it\u2019s beyond horrific. But what if it didn\u2019t?\u201d Does he still wish \u2026? He answers before the question is out. \u201cYes, I still wish I\u2019d won.\u201d Would you have let your kids go to Neverland? \u201cTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t let them go anywhere. You can put Michael Jackson out of this equation because I would not leave my seven-year-old child, boy or girl, with anybody unless they were family or I\u2019d known them for years. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d He says he is happier now with Emily and his four children than he has ever been in his adult life. But there have been setbacks. In 2012, his brother Andrew died at the age of 54. He hit such a low that he advised Emily to leave him. \u201cI said: \u2018You can either stay and stick with me through this, which personally I wouldn\u2019t, or you can go.\u2019 And she said: \u2018It\u2019s not even a question. We\u2019re going to get through it together.\u2019\u201d And they did. Coming out of that trough coincided with the last of his panic attacks. He says he realised he had mistaken grief for another bout of depression, and the realisation that he was simply working his way through his grief liberated him. Now Andre is making up for lost time, career-wise, doing what he would have done a couple of decades ago if his breakdown and reality TV had not intervened. As well as touring the UK with Grease, he recently made his big-screen acting debut in The Inheritance, a short film about a heroin addict for which he received a best actor nomination at the North Hollywood film festival. He tells me, gleefully, how full his diary is. You were supposed to be a here-today, gone-tomorrow pop star, I say \u2013 how come you\u2019re still here? He grins. \u201cI have no bloody idea,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful.\u201d And with that, he is off to Grease rehearsals and to prepare for his third coming. Grease the Musical is at Leeds Grand Theatre, 19 June to 20 July, then touring; greasethemusicalontour.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
