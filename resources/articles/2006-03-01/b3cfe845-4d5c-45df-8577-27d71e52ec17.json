Shaun Woodward The Labour MP (below), who is best known for once having been a Tory MP and being married to a Sainsbury heiress, has at last sold his Oxfordshire mansion. It fetched \u00a325 million, which is reported to be \u00a315m profit. We're very happy for him. Chocoholics The health benefits of chocolate, long suspected by many of us, were proven. A study showed that men who eat it every day decrease their risk of heart disease by half. It can, however, make it a tad more difficult to slip easily into your slacks. Reese Witherspoon The actress, who most recently played Johnny Cash's wife in Walk the Line, was last week named as Hollywood's highest-earning female star. A (sort of) bad week, then, for poor old Julia Roberts, who used to be the chart topper, but only receives \u00a314m per film. Witherspoon gets \u00a318m. An Oscar tonight would be a bonus. Christopher Gibbs The London-based art dealer bought a picture he liked at an auction in 1974, believing it to be by an unknown artist. Last week, it was revealed to be a lost work by Hans Holbein. Some guys have all the luck. Tweedy types The foxhunting ban may be regarded as a disaster all round, but now wild boar may be designated legal prey to help keep their numbers down. A bad week for Pandas The endangered species faced great peril lastweek, when one of their number was forced to pose for a photograph in the burly arms of our Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. The Earl of Leinster Maurice FitzGerald learned that an American builder from San Francisco is launching a challenge to his title. The builder claims that he is the rightful earl, his father having emigrated secretly to the USA. More bad news for FitzGerald is that Harriet Harman is said to be seriously investigating the claim. Jimi Hendrix The lyric 'scuse me while I kiss the sky' has topped a poll of mostmisheard song lines. It's widely thought that he is singing 'scuse me while I kiss this guy'. Sometimes, the truth is so disappointing. Thongs Sales figures showthat the stringy underwear is no longer the nation's favourite. After five years at the top of the pile - or front of the drawer - they've been beaten by normal pants. Tess of the d'Urbervilles Things have long been bad for one of English fiction's most unfortunate protagonists. Last week, the book of the same name was voted the novel most in need of a new, and happier, ending. Architectural conservatives A curved, 45-storey-high skyscraper, nicknamed the Walkie-Talkie, was proposed as an addition to London's skyline. It is expected to draw support from mayor Ken Livingstone who likes a vivid building. It will have Prince Charles dreaming of doric columns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
