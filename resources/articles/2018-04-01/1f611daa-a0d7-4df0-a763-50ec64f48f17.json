Oliver gave the penalty for a foul on Lucas V\u00e1zquez in the closing stages of a dramatic quarter-final that Madrid won 4-3 on aggregate. He sent off Buffon for protesting, his last European game ending with him departing to applause from the home fans. \u201cTo award such a doubtful, or super doubtful, penalty just ahead of the final whistle and destroy the work of a team who gave absolutely everything you have to have a rubbish bin instead of your heart,\u201d Buffon said. \u201cA human being cannot decide the elimination of a team with such decision. When I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m good enough, I put myself in a corner. He should do the same. It\u2019s a matter of sensibility. It means you don\u2019t know where you are, which teams are playing, you don\u2019t know shit.\u201d The goalkeeper added: \u201cYou need to be prepared for a game like this. You have to watch the first leg and see that a similar foul was not punished with a penalty for Juventus in Turin. And especially you need personality to referee a game like this. If you don\u2019t have personality, you better watch the game from the stands with your wife and your kids while eating fries. What did I say to him while I was protesting? I could say everything in that moment because when you take such decision in a certain moment of the game it means you don\u2019t know what sport is. \u201cWe had done something which seemed impossible. It\u2019s a pity it ended like this, unjustly. It was one tenth of a penalty. But life goes on.\u201d Max Allegri, the Juventus manager, defended Buffon, saying his reaction was \u201cunderstandable\u201d and also admitted he had exchanged words with the suspended Sergio Ramos as they crossed paths in the mouth of the tunnel where the Real defender had watched the second half. \u201cIt was a moment of confusion,\u201d Allegri said. \u201cGigi had that reaction but that\u2019s understandable. I don\u2019t know if that has been his last game, there were three seconds left and the result would have been historic, super important, and he had a human reaction. \u201cThe referee got out the red card and sent him off. As for the penalty, the referee said it was and he whistled it and there\u2019s nothing else we can say but we\u2019re left with a bitter taste.\u201d Allegri admitted he departed angry, hurt and convinced Juventus had at least deserved to take a dramatic quarter-final into extra time but said \u201ccrying is useless now\u201d. As he left he passed Ramos in the tunnel \u201che told me it was a clear penalty\u201d, Allegri revealed. \u201cI said: \u2018Clear? Grey, at least.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
