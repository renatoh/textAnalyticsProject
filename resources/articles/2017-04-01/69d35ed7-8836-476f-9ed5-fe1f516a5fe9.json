The defender has been publicly criticised by Mourinho on several occasions, including after the 1-1 draw against Everton on Tuesday. The 21-year-old came on as a second-half substitute at Old Trafford but Mourinho said the player was \u201cusing his body with my brain\u201d. That followed the Portuguese questioning Shaw\u2019s commitment, focus and ambition. Shaw has responded by saying he is determined to stay at Old Trafford. \u201cWith the stuff that has been going on it is hard for me to take because deep down that is not me as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cLike Jos\u00e9 said, he wants to see me fighting \u2013 and I will fight to the last second because I want to be here for the club. I want to play for the manager and I want to help this team get back to the top.\u201d The left-back suggested his application is not in question. \u201cI am working really hard at the moment, especially now more than ever. I am going through a phase where everything sort of is going against me, but I want this so badly, I want to prove everyone wrong.\u201d Shaw, who against Everton made his first appearance since January, said he was delighted to be back in the first team and thanked the United fans for their support during this difficult time. \u201cI have missed being on the pitch so much. I am loving it here at United, the fans are incredible and have been incredible the last couple of days for obviously what has been going on. But I am keeping my head up and I am going to fight to the last. I am not going to give up. \u201cThe fans have been so good to me and, like I said, especially the last sort of two days. That\u2019s why I love them. It is easy for them to see those comments and turn on me, do you know what I mean? But the passion they have always shown to me is amazing and something I don\u2019t and won\u2019t forget for a long time because it means a lot to me. I don\u2019t want to let them down and I\u2019ll fight for each and every one of the fans as well.\u201d United kept their unbeaten run intact against Everton thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s late penalty and travel to Sunderland on Sunday attempting to secure a win in order to close the gap on the top four. \u201cThere is still a very good chance of reaching the top four and that is our aim right now,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cObviously with the Europa League, that is another positive. If you look at the teams in it, we can be one of the favourites. We know we have got the quality and determination to win and do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
