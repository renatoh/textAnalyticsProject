Bush, in an attempt to copy the Right's recovery in the US. They have been studying American television advertising for tips on how to appeal subtly to women - without sending a feminist message that could offend traditional 'blue rinse' Tories. Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith will fly to Washington this week for his second meeting in seven months with Bush. He will attend an international gathering of right-wing leaders designed to share the lessons Bush learnt from fighting Bill Clinton with European parties battling similar 'Third Way' leaders. Duncan Smith's senior aides have already forged unprecedented links with their opposite numbers, emailing regularly for advice on campaigning techniques. Among the most vital is Bush's focus on so-called 'soccer moms' - thirty- and fortysomething women juggling often a part-time job with family duties like ferrying children to football matches. Bush fought heavily on education to win mothers' votes, a tactic the Tories are expected to borrow. 'The big issue on the Right in America is the growing economic and therefore political power of women,' said a senior Tory source. 'They link political messages to what women want. What we are trying to do is demonstrate we have answers to the problems that women regard as more salient.' Duncan Smith will not suddenly start spouting feminist values, aides say. Instead he will highlight issues thought to appeal to swing-voting mothers, from classroom discipline to shortfalls in pensions. He will travel to Washington next weekend for a rare meeting of the International Democrat Union - a group of sympathetic world leaders established by George Bush Snr and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, now chaired by former Tory leader William Hague. They will swap ideas proven successful in other countries and hear from 'winners who have defeated the now declining Third Way'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
