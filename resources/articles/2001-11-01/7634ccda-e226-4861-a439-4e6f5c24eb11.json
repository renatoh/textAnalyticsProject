It contains several never before seen scenes including Harry and Ron playing \"wizard\" chess as well as Harry tackling the fearsome troll. Fans will also get their first glimpse of Maggie Smith's character Professor McGonagall transforming a cat back into human form. This will be the final trailer before the film opens in Britain on 16 November. \u00b7 Meanwhile, it has been announced that Rik Mayall's performance as the rude ghost Peeves in the new Harry Potter movie has been axed. The cheeky apparition, who torments boy wizard Harry and his friends by making vulgar sounds and throwing things, is the only main character from the book to be chopped. \"It has nothing to do with Rik's Performance,\" a spokesman for the film said. \"It was simply to keep the film down to two and a half hours. Not every element in the book could be included in the final version.\" \u00b7 Reclusive megastars Michael Jackson and Liza Minnelli are planning a movie together, according to the PeopleNews gossip website. \"It's about two struggling entertainers trying to make it,\" the 42-year-old prince of pop disclosed. \"They get turned away everywhere they go - with some of the best dancing ever. I'm not joking!\" Jackson and Minnelli have been friends for many years. He believes they are soulmates, insisting they come from the same planet \"It's called Capricious Anomaly in the Sea of Space,\" he explained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
