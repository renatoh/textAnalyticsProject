Trump said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that the Democrats refused to attend the White House meeting and called them \u201cweak\u201d on crime and illegal immigration. \u201cThey\u2019ve been all talk and they\u2019ve been no action, and now it\u2019s even worse. Now it\u2019s not even talk,\u201d Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room, where he sat between to empty chairs with placards for Pelosi and Schumer. \u201cThey\u2019re not showing up to the meeting.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were seated at opposite ends of the large conference table. Ryan called it \u201cregrettable\u201d that the Democrats couldn\u2019t attend; McConnell said he couldn\u2019t recall \u201cever turning down\u201d a meeting with the White House. Pelosi responded to Trump\u2019s comments on Twitter, saying that his \u201cverbal abuse will no longer be tolerated\u201d. In an earlier statement, the two Democratic leaders said that instead of meeting the president, they intended to negotiate directly with their Republican counterparts in an attempt to avert a government shutdown next month. Schumer and Pelosi said: \u201cGiven that the president doesn\u2019t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. \u201cRather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won\u2019t result in an agreement, we\u2019ve asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet this afternoon. We don\u2019t have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we\u2019re going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement.\u201d Their decision not to attend the meeting followed a morning tweet from the president: But Republican leaders McConnell and Ryan dismissed the Democrats\u2019 offer and challenged them to attend the White House meeting if they wished to negotiate over a spending plan. \u201cWe have important work to do, and Democratic leaders have continually found new excuses not to meet with the administration to discuss these issues,\u201d the two Republicans said. \u201cDemocrats are putting government operations, particularly resources for our men and women on the battlefield, at great risk by pulling these antics. There is a meeting at the White House this afternoon, and if Democrats want to reach an agreement, they will be there.\u201d The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said the meeting would proceed as scheduled with McConnell and Ryan. \u201cThe president\u2019s invitation to the Democrat leaders still stands and he encourages them to put aside their pettiness, stop the political grandstanding, show up and get to work,\u201d Sanders said. The meeting was intended to discuss the year-end spending bill to keep the federal government running and avert a shutdown. When the pair met with Trump to discuss government spending earlier this year, the president unexpectedly sided with \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d, infuriating Republicans. He and the Democrats made a deal to increase the debt limit and finance the government through early December. That deadline is now coming up. As McConnell prepared to leave for the meeting at the White House, he said Pelosi and Schumer\u2019s protest demonstrated a \u201clack of seriousness\u201d. \u201cI never refused to go to a meeting that President Obama called, a bipartisan meeting,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt never occurred to me that I could just say to President Obama I\u2019m not showing up. That strikes me as a lack of seriousness about the matter before us.\u201d Following McConnell to the podium, Schumer defended their decision and implored the president to \u201cstop tweeting and start leading\u201d. Schumer said: \u201cWith his tweet this morning, the president made sure that the meeting is nothing but a photo-op. These issues are far too serious for these kinds of games.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
