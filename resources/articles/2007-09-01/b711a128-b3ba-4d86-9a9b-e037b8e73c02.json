For two years we have been writing letters, tabling parliamentary questions and challenging ministers on the failure of government departments to meet their legal requirements. It sends a weak message if the government's own departments take a lax attitude to race equality and fail to comply with even basic monitoring requirements. We are also aware of similar problems in departments on gender and disability, and we have made complaints to the Equal Opportunities Commission and Disability Rights Commission. Added to this we have the government pressing ahead with compulsory redundancies in a number of departments, which is having a disproportionate impact on black and minority ethnic staff. The new Commission for Equality and Human Rights can only be successful if it is given the necessary resources, and we are still waiting for government commitments on jobs and funding. Mark Serwotka PCS general secretary John McDonnell MP Chair, PCS parliamentary group It is shocking that 15 government departments and agencies have failed to implement ethnic monitoring of staff despite the fact that they have had more than five years to meet such targets in a Labour target-driven world. But one has only to look at cabinet meetings to see that Gordon Brown's government is far more Anglo-Saxon-male-dominated than that of Tony Blair. Yet this reality is not surprising in Britain. There is still a profound reluctance to openly discuss prejudice here, unlike in the US, where there is a public willingness to both frankly debate these matters and put affirmative action in place. As a black woman, I consider that there is still only lip service being paid to addressing racial inequality in the UK. Dr Ama Biney London In your story regarding the failure of government departments to effectively promote race equality, you failed to note that earlier in the summer a similar report, Up to the Mark?, was produced by the Disability Rights Commission, identifying 10 government departments including the Department of Health, the Home Office, Defra and the Treasury, that were failing to meet their similar legal duties on promoting disability equality. Since the report was published we been working closely with all of these departments, who have all agreed to make significant revisions in order to meet their legal responsibilities. The DRC is optimistic because of the positive response of government departments. However, we are sure that the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will be looking very carefully at the revised disability equality schemes which they will be receiving from government departments over the next couple of months. Marie Pye Head of public sector delivery, Disability Rights Commission The National Coalition of Black-Led Organisations was set up in 2004 to help government to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to promote racial justice and social cohesion. After a two-year study of departmental race equality schemes, we published a report detailing shortcomings and invited departments to attend a conference to address these issues. Ministers declined, and some equality units even resorted to spoiling tactics to camouflage their inactivity. The chickens have come home to roost! Jerome Mack MBE Vice-chair, NCBLO The CRE states: \"If you are an ethnic minority in Britain you are still more likely to be stopped by the police, be excluded from school, suffer poor health treatment and live in poor housing\". If \"ethnic minority\" were replaced by \"working class\", would the same assessment apply? Andrew Reeves Middlesbrough"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
