The chance squandered in 1948 was the chance to peacefully partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, as voted for by the UN in resolution 181. Tonge's hated Zionists accepted resolution 181 and agreed to partition; the neighbouring Arab states rejected it and instead invaded the territory that the UN had allocated to the Jews. Had Arab leaders not rejected partition, a Palestinian state would have existed alongside Israel from the outset. Matthew Harris Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel \u2022\u2008Paul Robeson was not the first black actor of note to play Othello either (Letters, 23 August). That was Ira Aldridge, who had the role in the 1820s. Aldridge, plagued by prejudice in his US homeland, emigrated to the UK, but found London almost as hostile \u2013 though theatres and critics in the north of England and in Ireland were not \u2013 and had great success in Europe, especially Russia; he spoke several languages and could play Othello in Russian. Ira settled in the UK and married an Englishwoman. His daughter Amanda gave elocution lessons to Paul Robeson before he played Othello in the 1930s.

David Rowe, a retired academic, gave up after 35 minutes, saying: \"I don't think this one can be solved by logic alone.\" I managed it in 28 minutes by applying female logic! Annie Bielecka Wivenhoe, Essex \u2022\u2008\"Is the internet rewiring our brains?\" asks John Harris (G2, August 20). Since our brains don't have wires, the answer is no. A better metaphor would be \"redecorating\": the tasteful, harmonious pastels of our convolutions are being replaced with lurid, dissonant swirls.
