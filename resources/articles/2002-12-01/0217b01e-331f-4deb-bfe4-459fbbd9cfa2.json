But that will depend on their front players pulling them through, because question-marks remain at the back. Although Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's and Sir Alex Ferguson's teams kept clean sheets in midweek against Spanish opposition, I still get the impression they can be picked off. But by the same yardstick they can open up top sides, and there were some particularly good signs for United. Ruud van Nistelrooy's goals keep on coming and Juan Sebastian Veron had easily the best game I've seen him play for United. With his energy and passing he looked like the player they paid all that money for. You'd expect United to qualify for the quarter-finals after two wins out of two, and defensively they have tightened up on what we saw in Europe a few years ago. But they're not rock-solid yet. What Alex will have to decide is whether to stick at centre-back with Wes Brown and Mikael Silvestre, who've done well, or bring back Rio Ferdinand and Laurent Blanc. I wouldn't be surprised to see that second pair play the big games because Alex likes Blanc's experience. What's been a bonus in defence is the form of John O'Shea. He's been excellent at full-back, although I believe his best position will be in the middle and he looks the sort who can score from set plays. United haven't had an abundance of players with that threat over recent years. Even Jaap Stam didn't weigh in with many when he was here. I've seen O'Shea miss quite a few opportunities, so I think there's a fair chance he'll start scoring before long. On Arsenal's back four, I think they need Martin Keown back very quickly. He was on the bench against Valencia but I can't imagine he'll stay there long. Pascal Cygan looks like he needs to come out of the side. He's had his time and I thought he did very well when he first got in, but he's coming back down the field a little bit now. I couldn't believe Pablo Aimar outjumped him two or three times on Tuesday and near the end he was beaten for pace by John Carew. I think Arsenal would be more solid and mobile with Keown on the right and Sol Campbell on the left, where he's played many times for Tottenham and England. But even then they might stuggle to keep out the top Champions League sides. Their onus still has to be on going forward, and on their day they're capable of beating anyone in Europe. They'd be even better equipped, though, with a more aggressive striker to partner Thierry Henry. It was noticeable against Valencia that they could do with somebody who can pressurise and terrorise defenders more. Arsenal score a lot of great goals but maybe they need someone in the mould of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, who can force an issue and somehow drive a goal. The team looked edgy to start with against Valencia and I wonder whether they're even more of a confidence side than most. It's possible with their style of play that they need everything to be going right for them, and maybe the defeat at Old Trafford shook them more than it should shake a side with their experience. They have to hope self- belief is high when the Champions League resumes in February. Certainly they can't have a shred of self-doubt if they go through to the last eight. Arsenal have World Cup winners in their squad and others who have won big trophies, but in Europe they haven't been too successful and they need the right mentality. I think Nwankwo Kanu, who's not a regular, is the only one in that squad who's won the European Cup. What United have in their favour is years of experience of reaching the knockout stage. It won't faze them to be there. I don't expect Newcastle to go any further and the five who looked best equipped are Arsenal, United, Milan, Real Madrid and Valencia. Real have started the second phase poorly, with only one point, but I think they'll overhaul Borussia Dortmund. When all their stars perform they're on a different planet from anyone, and if they get to the final they'll be odds-on favourites. But their problem might be getting there, in bread-and-butter games. It may be a case of too many chiefs now and not enough Indians. Arsenal and United won't complain if Real slip up, and they'll know from Real's record that attacking force can succeed in the Champions League even if you're not watertight at the back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
