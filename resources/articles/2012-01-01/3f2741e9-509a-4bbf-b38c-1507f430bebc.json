Even though he began his career by developing The Monkees, a TV sitcom about a faux pop group, Schneider (who died last month) went on to carve out a 10-year career as one of America's most interesting producers \u2013 and did as much as anyone to kick off the glory years of the Hollywood New Wave in the late 60s and early 70s. In the mid-60s, the Vietnam war was at its height, and in America (and England) there was a real cultural fracture between the \"establishment\" media \u2013 hopelessly unhip entertainments like The Monkees' TV show \u2013 and the anti-establishment films everyone knew were cool, but which were all made in Europe. This had to change; and Schneider found himself part of a group of formidable would-be film independents including a young actor and screenwriter, Jack Nicholson, and directors Bob Rafelson, Monte Hellman and Henry Jaglom. Most of the above, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, had been \"discovered\" by Roger Corman and had worked on Corman's own \"youth\" movies. Schneider's first foray into film was somewhat lighter-weight: he was the executive producer of Head, a spin-off from the Monkees' TV show. But some talented collaborators \u2013 Rafelson and Nicholson \u2013 and the decision to include footage from Vietnam, made Head more than the average boyband joyride. A year later, Schneider and Rafelson put together another feature, about two drug dealers riding from California to New Orleans' Mardi Gras on motorbikes. The pitch makes it sound like any other messed-up, drug-induced, third-rate, biker B-picture of the period \u2013 but who could have predicted the epic success of Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider? This extraordinary film, which cost some $400,000 (the equivalent of $2m or $3m today), had grossed $60m at the box office only three years later. In the wake of Easy Rider, the studios wanted to invest in low-budget, edgy, \"independent\" pictures. Schneider took advantage: a year later, he was the executive producer of Five Easy Pieces, with Rafelson directing and Nicholson starring. This highly regarded film sounds like its executive producer's project in more ways than one: the story of a young man who eschews his wealthy family and a career as a pianist to work as a roughneck on oil wells. In 1971, Schneider plunged into production on three features. Two of them were low-budget independent films directed by his friends: Nicholson's Drive, He Said, and Jaglom's A Safe Place. The third was riskier: high-end, literary material, to be directed by another of Corman's cadre, Peter Bogdanovich, in black and white. At this point, the studios were insisting that all their product be filmed in colour. Only a high-powered producer such as Schneider could have pulled off The Last Picture Show. The Last Picture Show was a great success, but Schneider walked away from mainstream films and put money into a notable documentary, contrasting Vietnam's American war-makers with its Asian victims. Hearts and Minds, directed by Peter Davis, is a great and harrowing film. Made in 1974, with the war still grinding on, it won the Oscar for best documentary and, in acceptance of the award, Schneider read a message of peace from the North Vietnamese delegation at the Paris peace talks. Perhaps not surprisingly, he made few features thereafter. He did produce one more blockbuster art-movie, Terrence Malick's ponderously beautiful Days of Heaven; and then its antithesis, Tracks. Even compared to Easy Rider and The Last Picture Show, Tracks may be the best film he ever produced. A low-budget picture directed by Jaglom, set during the Vietnam war, it starred Dennis Hopper as a military officer seemingly escorting a coffin to its destination, via passenger rail. \"Seemingly\", because nothing is what it seems in this amazing, timeless, clever film. Shot on a tiny budget, it was guerrilla film-making at its finest. And the result was no faux-European striving, but genuine American film art. An American film-maker can't wish to achieve greater than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
