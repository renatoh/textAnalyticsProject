In fact what Humphrys said was that the earlier comments by a BBC colleague that had apparently angered Osborne were \u201cobviously a joke\u201d (BBC defends \u2018hyperbolic coverage\u2019 of cuts after chancellor\u2019s criticism, 5 December, page 10). \u2022 A feature in which writers picked their favourite books of 2014 included a recommendation by Ian Rankin for Van Morrison\u2019s Lit Up Inside and said it \u201ccollects many of the great man\u2019s favourite lyrics and includes a foreword by poet David Meltzer, a long-time fan\u201d. The reference to David Meltzer was an editing error. Meltzer wrote a foreword for an edition of Lit Up Inside published in the US. The \u201clong-time fan\u201d Ian Rankin was referring to was himself: he wrote the foreword for the UK edition (A book for everyone, 29 November, page 2, Review). \u2022 A gardening column about elephant garlic in last Saturday\u2019s Weekend magazine was illustrated wrongly with a photograph of ordinary garlic. Elephant garlic is not a true garlic, but more closely related to leeks (Grow your own elephant \u2013 in garlic form, page 127)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
