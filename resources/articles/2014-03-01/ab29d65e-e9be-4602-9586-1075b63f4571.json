Competition takes place over nine days in the same venues as the Winter Olympics. The Games feature around 700 competitors from 44 nations, including newcomers Brazil, Turkey and Uzbekistan, though South Africa's decision not to send anyone means no African country will be represented. THE FLAME The Sochi Paralympic flame will be formed at a Flame Uniting Ceremony on Wednesday. Flames from 46 different Russian cities, plus a new Heritage Flame lit in Stoke Mandeville, Aylesbury, on Saturday night, will come together to form the Paralympic flame for the final days of the relay. Saturday night's event was part of a new tradition recognising Stoke Mandeville as the birthplace of the Paralympic movement in 1948. THE SPORTS Alpine skiing: Includes downhill, super-G, slalom and super-combined disciplines in sitting, standing and visually impaired skiing (athletes ski with a guide in front of them). Biathlon: Athletes ski three 2.5km legs (7.5km in total) and fire at five targets (located 10m from the shooter) between each leg using air guns mounted on stands. Sitting, standing and visually impaired categories. Cross-country skiing: Individual or Team, Classical or Freestyle events ranging between 2.5km and 20km.

Ice sledge hockey: A full-contact, high-speed game that has been called wheelchair rugby on ice. Wheelchair curling: No sweeping \u2013 it's all about the delivery from hand or stick.
