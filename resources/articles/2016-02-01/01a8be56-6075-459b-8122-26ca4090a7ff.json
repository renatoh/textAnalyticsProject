Eddie Jones has ordered an all-out assault on an Italy defence that has conceded 36 tries in the last eight rounds of the Six Nations and the inclusion of six forwards on the England bench has given the side greater ball-carrying options than last weekend at Murrayfield, when Billy Vunipola made more than 60% of the ground covered by the pack with ball in hand. England fashioned an excellent try in the second half for Jack Nowell but in the main it was their defence that took them to victory in Jones\u2019s first game in charge. A comfortable victory over Italy at the Olympic Stadium in Rome on Sunday would set them up for the home matches against Ireland and Wales, which will go a long way to deciding the destiny of the title. \u201cThe transition [from the previous regime] has been very smooth,\u201d says Ben Youngs, the scrum-half one of three changes to the side that started in Edinburgh. \u201cThere is a lot of information to take in quickly and there is only so long you can spend on a training field on your feet. You have to look at tapes, sit down with the coaches and get to grips with how they want to play the game. \u201cWhat was important against Scotland was getting the win: with a new coach you just want to get the first game over and done with. We have had something to review and Eddie has been good, looking at areas where we can improve. We know that the defence will come more quickly than the attack: you can get a defensive system in place pretty quickly, but attack is something players and supporters have to be patient with.\u201d England were lateral in attack in the first half against Scotland, lacking a midfield driving force with Manu Tuilagi still unavailable, and played a more territorial game in the second period, exerting pressure on Scotland through kicks and chases and not moving the ball for the sake of it. \u201cWe want to play an attacking game, threatening from our own half as well as the opposition\u2019s,\u201d says Youngs. \u201cTo do that, you need to play at a high tempo and pace and be able to sustain it. That is why, as Eddie has highlighted, it is important that all the players are as fit as we can be. The margins are getting smaller and smaller in the international game and a lot of the time, matches are won in the last 15 minutes when you need to be firing physically and mentally. \u201cWe have backs who are footballers and unbelievably gifted in space, like Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph and Mike Brown. George Ford and Owen Farrell are expert in putting them into space. I do not think it will take long, but at the moment, when we get to the fourth phase it could look a bit disjointed. It is something we are working really hard at and we want it to click as quickly as possible. Each game will see a vast improvement and as a scrum-half it is exciting.\u201d Youngs and Danny Care spent the Lancaster era jockeying for position, each enjoying an extended run in the side, and Jones has used his first two matches to look at both. \u201cEddie has worked with the best in the likes of George Gregan and Fourie du Preez and I am trying to tap into his huge amount of knowledge,\u201d says Youngs. \u201cIt is a very competitive position with Danny and we are both buying into the system. Eddie wants from his scrum-half what most coaches do: the basics, a good service and a kicking game which is so vital in international rugby to win territory. \u201cOur back line is pretty similar to the one that played against France in last year\u2019s Six Nations when we went well. We have been given the licence to play like that and it is about making sure everyone is on the same page. We are not taking Italy for granted: they are closing the gap every year and they are extremely competitive in front of their own supporters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
