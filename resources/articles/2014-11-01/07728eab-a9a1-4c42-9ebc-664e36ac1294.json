The city\u2019s first building by the controversial architect is part of a larger $1.1bn masterplan for the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), but is already attracting a lot of attention. In October, Gehry denounced 98% of modern architecture as \u201cshit\u201d in response to some journalists describing his buildings as \u201cemblematic\u201d and pure \u201cspectacle\u201d. It was a more polite media who assembled, sidestepping the elephant in the room, for a sneak preview of his new work. Patrick Woods, the deputy vice-chancellor of UTS, came to the architect\u2019s defence without prompting, diplomatically emphasising: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the building; it\u2019s about what happens in the building.\u201d Paying respect to the teamwork of those involved, Woods stressed that the project had been characterised by a lack of ego on Gehry\u2019s part. \u201cThis is an individual that based on his history has every right to have [one] \u2026 but there was never, ever any display of that,\u201d Woods said. These were the words of a client in defence of their architect. However, a discussion of ego and emblem comes with the territory when commissioning \u201ca Gehry\u201d. This, the man known for creating such icons as the Guggenheim that put Bilbao on the map, the Walt Disney concert hall in Los Angeles, and, most recently, the Foundation Vuitton in Paris. \u201cAs with most Frank-designed buildings, there is a degree of trepidation when one goes into these projects as to how they can be built,\u201d Woods admitted. Gehry is an architect whose crazy curves are his calling card. This aesthetic was famously satirised with a guest appearance on The Simpsons in which he was chosen to design an iconic building for Springfield. There is no discussion of Gehry without curves or controversy. The positioning of this new building for the UTS business school, situated behind Sydney\u2019s main artery, George Street, and cramped between a laneway and an old tramway that runs above Darling Drive, is quite unassuming. It has none of the advantages of that other Sydney icon, the Opera House, with its plum position on Bennelong Point. and it should not have to compete. But the flamboyant form is unmistakably Gehry, with an almost comical, cartoon-like fa\u00e7ade peeping over the rectilinear buildings beside it, mocking their square-ness in the process. You would expect that flamboyance to be concentrated on the public face. The surprise is that Gehry\u2019s curves carry through the skin to the inside. As you run your hands along the plasterboard interior walls, it feels like the slightly alien shapes a foetus makes on the protruding belly of an expectant mother \u2013 disconcerting but fascinating at the same time. Brian Moore, executive project architect, explains: \u201cIf you imagine a whale ribcage inside the wall \u2013 bricks attached to one side and plasterboard the other \u2013 what you see on the outside is what you see on the inside.\u201d These materials are pretty much the same you would have in your home, but by a structural sleight-of-hand, Gehry and his team have created a wall that goes in and out of shape, seemingly defying gravity. UTS will jump to the defence of its $180m spend and \u201cstarchitect\u201d, but it\u2019s unnecessary. The building speaks for itself. The foyer, from its geometric white walls down to the smooth concrete floors with neat little saw-cuts, has more the atmosphere of an art gallery than a business school. The interiors are light and airy with sharp shards of natural light slicing the corridors. Even the fire stairs are an attractive light-filled glass prism which may end up being used by students more than the lifts \u2013 warding off future heart attacks among these businesspeople-to-be. The building\u2019s true test will come when it opens its doors to the first students next semester. Gehry will be in Sydney for the formal opening in February 2015, and we will no double hear his opinion then. For now, the building is a new piece of cotton candy for Sydneysiders, a well-crafted piece of cotton candy in brick and plaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
