They say to me: \"Yes, life is grim, but there is also beauty in the darkness.\" Many of the bands I like most were popular in the 80s. Maybe I love them because that was the time I was discovering music. Perhaps it is the bleakness of the era that infused the music, which fits my mood as I commute to work. At the moment I've got a fairly short commute, but I'm about to move house which will mean an extra half hour. I need long songs to keep me going - the 80s was the natural home of the 12-inch remix. Duran Duran's extended Night Versions are particularly magical. On the way home I get restless, constantly flicking from track to track. Stan Ridgway's Camouflage is one I never skip. It simultaneously sends a shiver up my spine and puts a smile on my face. 1 The Mission Tower Of Strength 2 The Sisters of Mercy This Corrosion 3 Fields of the Nephilim Moonchild 4 Duran Duran Planet Earth 5 Stan Ridgway Camouflage \u00b7 Share your favourite commuting soundtrack with us.
