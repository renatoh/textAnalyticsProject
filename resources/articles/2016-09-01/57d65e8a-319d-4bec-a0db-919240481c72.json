Liverpool, playing football \u201clike hell\u201d according to their manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, inflicted the first defeat of the Italian\u2019s tenure at Stamford Bridge with an eye-catching win to join their hosts two points from the top of the table. While Klopp could rejoice in a fine victory, Conte was left contemplating a shoddy defensive record at home that has seen them keep only one clean sheet in the league all year, with too many of his players having wilted when it mattered. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t forget last season,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cThat was such a bad season, and I don\u2019t want to repeat it. When you finish the season in 10th place, there is something strange. It\u2019s not natural. It\u2019s not simple. When you finish in 10th place it means you have to work very hard to improve to make sure you don\u2019t repeat the bad season. I think that, this season, the manager, the players, all the people who work for Chelsea must take their responsibility. Because, I repeat, we win together, we lose together. \u201cThis is very important. I don\u2019t want to repeat a bad season like last year. I don\u2019t want that. For this reason we must pay attention in every single moment of the game, in every minute. I\u2019m the coach so I must work more on this aspect. Now, it\u2019s not enough because this is not the first time this has happened. We must feel the danger in every single moment of the game, if we want to win and think like a great team. Chelsea is a great team, but we must show this in every single game, to pay attention and be focused.\u201d The manager had been unimpressed with the fragility exploited by Watford and Swansea City already this season, albeit those games were not lost. He pointed to the absence of John Terry as potentially critical as Liverpool prospered from a quickly taken free-kick and a throw-in. \u201cI think we missed the organisation in certain situations: free-kicks, throw-ins,\u201d he added. \u201cWe gave away two goals, and we must pay attention. Usually when you lose, [your performance was] never perfect. For this reason, we must work more with great patience.\u201d Klopp has seen his side glean 10 points from trips to Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a home victory over the champions, Leicester City. Asked if his team are now contenders for the title, he said: \u201cSomeone asked me that when we won 3-1 last season against Chelsea. My answer then was: \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 I remember it well. Look, we have 10 points. That\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m really happy after these difficult fixtures. We know we can play good football, we\u2019re convinced about our quality. We just have to keep it up. Today we played football like hell. It was really nice to watch. In the second half it was a bit more difficult but, after their goal, we managed it well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
