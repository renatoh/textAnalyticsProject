Age: Considerably younger. Appearance: Fit. Why does it have to be all about looks? Because apart from youth, that\u2019s the main bit of being a toyboy. Not necessarily. Yes, necessarily. I\u2019d like to hear your definition of toyboy, in that case. Toyboy (n): a younger, handsome, well-built, not terribly bright lover. How dare you assume that\u2019s what women are looking for in a toyboy? Sorry, are you looking for an unattractive toyboy who is older than you? No, but why can\u2019t a toyboy be much younger and also very clever? I don\u2019t know, but I can\u2019t think of an example. What about Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s boyfriend Rye Dag Holmboe? The name doesn\u2019t ring a bell. Can you describe him? Well, he is 21 years her junior \u2026 Classic toyboy. That\u2019s unfair. \u201cToyboy is a really sexist remark,\u201d Bonham Carter told the Sunday Times magazine recently. \u201cIt implies he\u2019s got nothing to offer than his body.\u201d So his body\u2019s no good? Bonham Carter acknowledged that his body is \u201cfantastic\u201d. \u201cBut along with the body,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s got a great mind and a great humour.\u201d I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very nice. But can two people born 21 years apart have enough in common to sustain a relationship? Bonham Carter thinks so. \u201cHe\u2019s an old soul in a young body,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat more could I want?\u201d \u201cOld soul in a young body\u201d is just code. It means either \u201csocially awkward\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t dance\u201d. You\u2019re just being intolerant now. Can you imagine someone implying that a man and his beautiful, much younger girlfriend had nothing in common? I can, just about. So what if I told you that I, as a woman, was looking for a powerfully built younger man with whom I could foster an intellectual partnership as well as a lasting intellectual bond? I\u2019d say OK, but that you\u2019ve come to the wrong dating agency. We just pair toyboys with cougars \u2013 no funny stuff. Cougars? Mature women looking for younger men to toy with. How impossibly reductive. Isn\u2019t there a more sophisticated approach? There is one website offering \u201ca space free from all existing social connotations about age-gap relationships \u2026 facilitating members to build a genuine connection with one another\u201d. Perfect. What\u2019s it called? Toyboy Warehouse. Do say: \u201cListen, I don\u2019t care how many A-levels you\u2019ve got. Just don\u2019t call me mummy and we\u2019ll get along fine.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWell, this is awkward \u2013 I\u2019m sure I wrote tomboy on my profile.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
