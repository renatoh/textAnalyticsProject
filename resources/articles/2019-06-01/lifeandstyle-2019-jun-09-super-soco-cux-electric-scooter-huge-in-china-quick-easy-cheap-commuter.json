Stand on any junction and the sheer number of two-wheelers weaving past you is bewildering. They carry everything from smart young executives to families on the school run and even farmers on their way to market. On a recent holiday we had a points system so we could play scooter cricket: three passengers was a single; livestock was a four; anything outrageous was a six (this included a set of dining chairs, an 8ft mirror, and a slaughtered pig riding pillion having been strapped to the rider). A rider actually wearing a helmet meant you were bowled out. But the buzzing, screeching and whining of millions of scooter engines \u2013 in China, it\u2019s estimated there are more than 300m on the road \u2013 is slowly being replaced by a more otherworldly sound: total silence. In an attempt to reduce pollution and the issue of tailpipe emissions from these noisy two-stroke engines, several Asian governments, particularly China and India, are promoting electric two-wheelers. China is by far and away the world\u2019s leading producer. Forecasters estimate the market there will be worth an astonishing $12bn in the next five years. It\u2019s not surprising, therefore, that people have begun to realise that what works so well over there \u2013 clean, light and cheap scooters with a range of about 50km \u2013 is going to offer fed-up commuters a transport option in congested cities over here. The market here in the UK is in its infancy. In fact, you could argue it\u2019s barely out of the maternity ward. Britain\u2019s most popular electric motorcycle manufacturer is Super Soco. The company was only launched in 2017. Last year it became the first to sell more than 100 bikes in a year \u2013 and that was 25% of the overall market. In China, in the same period, 22.7m were sold, which is more than in the rest of the world combined. If you are an early-adopter, you\u2019ll find Super Soco has several very rewarding bikes. The latest to join its fleet is a lightweight moped called the CUX. It weighs just 70kg, has a top speed of 28mph and a range of about 40 miles. It has a 60V lithium battery and a 1.3KW Bosch motor. The battery can be fully recharged in under seven hours, meaning commuters can ride the machine to work, charge the removable battery and then ride home again. The scooters have an external charger and removable battery and can be charged at any common household socket. Electricity currently costs about \u00a30.15 per kWh, so using a Super Soco electric scooter means you will spend less than \u00a31.00 per 100 miles \u2013 or 1p per mile! The CUX is a ideal for anyone who wants to travel to work, but doesn\u2019t want the expense of a bigger motorbike or the modest exertion of an electric bicycle. It costs \u00a32,099 (including a government grant) so it\u2019s priced in the same range as some of the posher e-bikes. The scooter is comfortable, nimble, nippy and soaks up the bumps and lumps of our pitted roads with ease. It\u2019s all-in-one bodywork gives it a smooth and modern look \u2013 as if it has been designed by a freelancer from Apple. It comes in white, red, silver or grey. Swift, green, cheap and easy are all words we\u2019d love to use to describe our ideal commute. It\u2019s not often you can add fun to the list, too. But the Super Soco is also super perky. It\u2019s hard not to enjoy yourself. Twist the throttle and off you go, zipping to work with a smile on your face. Cool kit Litelok\u2019s wearable bike lock is light, flexible and super-secure.
