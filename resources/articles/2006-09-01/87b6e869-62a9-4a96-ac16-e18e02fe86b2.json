His has been the voice of the summer, in those quarters Lily Allen's couldn't reach. 'You Give Me Something', Morrison's breakout single, is proving almost as inescapable as 'You're Beautiful', the last love song sung with the aid of an acoustic guitar by a man called James. Morrison's debut album Undiscovered went to number one on release a month ago. He's at the head of a pack of slightly tousled, tastefully soulful singer-songwriters demanding the attention of the post-teen record buyer. Corinne Bailey Rae (with whom Morrison toured) is holding up the lady end of things; Paolo Nutini is the other young scruff vying for the same old music market. Dressed down in baggy jeans and a rumpled black shirt that wilts further in the heat, he looks a little like Chris Martin, back when the Coldplay singer still had woolly, pre-famous hair. Morrison's appeal rests on a kind of trompe l'oeil. He has the appearance of a doe-eyed 21-year-old whose sessions with a stylist are continuing, but has a middle-aged soul man's vocal style: blacker and more lived in than his life. It's the same trick that made fellow West Country soul-singer Joss Stone the toast of 2003. But when, you wonder, will record companies find a top-flight grime MC trapped inside the body of a Minnesotan boy scout? The voice suggests a youth misspent behind bike sheds, dyeing Morrison's vocal chords yellow, but the truth is more moving. Morrison had whooping cough in infancy, one of a string of troubles that beset the singer. His mother's council house burnt down; he used to make ends meet by busking. It got so bad, he even applied to be on Fame Academy Veteran soul producer Jerry Wexler has said of the voice: 'Hear it once and you will forever recognise it', the most resonant of the many plaudits that have come his way. For his part, Morrison has talked a lot in interviews about passion, soulfulness and authenticity, the kind of buzzwords guaranteed to get the shadowy taste-making cabal of Radio 2 (most of whom have pimped Morrison hard) all moist-eyed and bushy-tailed. Tonight, Morrison delivers if not passion, soulfulness and authenticity, then at least an approximation of them, belting out his songs on a slick of spittle, and stamping his foot a lot. There are strings of oversized lightbulbs hanging atmospherically at the back of this soul karaoke, suggesting an era - Otis Redding's perhaps - when they didn't have whizz-bang stage effects. The only downside is that when the bulbs light up red, they look a little like deflated balloons at the fag end of a party. Morrison excels at the dramatic bluster often mistaken for soul. He's less good on quietly planting a pearl of succour somewhere between your pancreas and spleen, which is what soul does when it's working. Songs like 'You Give Me Something', or the Louis Armstrong-quoting follow-up single 'Wonderful World' are adept and classicist tonight, without sounding remotely classic. Too often, Morrison's songs resort to a bank of words, rhymes and sentiments rife with cliches ('Oh life can be strange,' ponders 'If The Rain Must Fall', 'good and bad in so many ways'). Even more pertinent is that these tunes were co-written with a coterie of professional songwriters who should know better. Sometimes a half-decent song does penetrate the fug of cab-driver philosophising. 'Call the Police' (co-written by Eg White, who wrote Will Young's 'Leave Right Now') rounds off the encore potently. The obliquely hurt and angry 'Letter', on the surface a break-up song, but in fact addressed to his mother, rightly gets some of the loudest cheers of the evening. From the point of view of the ticket buyer, it's all a rousing success. Morrison, a little nervous and rushed and gabbly between songs, plays his hit album with few departures; the front rows get sweated on. 'One Last Chance' has a little dub guitar not audible on the record. Morrison's effusive keyboard player Nikolai conjures up skeins of ersatz strings and plays a melodica too. By the end, people are singing Morrison's lyrics back at him, and a woman with a Stereophonics logo tattooed across her back nearly falls off the balcony in excitement. There is no doubting Morrison's commitment or energy. He has the kind of gauche charisma and underdog backstory that makes his success just about bearable: no one will hate him like some hate James Blunt. But Morrison has no grasp of subtlety: in his mouth, everything is a crescendo. The best bit of the gig comes when he goes off, then teasingly waggles a sweaty towel from the wings before coming back for an encore. It's the kind of comic, spontaneous, authentic gesture his time onstage sorely lacked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
