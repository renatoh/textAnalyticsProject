Sir Ronnie Flanagan is to assess improvements needed in the force, which critics say has been infiltrated by local militias. He will independently review capabilities and present his findings to ministers early next year . The defence secretary, John Reid, acknowledged that there was a \"problem\" with the Iraqi police and that Sir Ronnie had been appointed to deal with it. Mr Reid told the BBC's Politics Show that the issue would be tackled \"head on\". \"Ronnie Flanagan has been sent there to find out first of all what the situation on the ground truly is as objectively as we can. He will assess the objectiveness and neutrality of the police,\" he said. \"There's a problem with the police in terms of split loyalties running from sympathy for the local people, right through to infiltration with the militia.\" Sir Ronnie, who has already made one visit to Basra, has found that progress on policing is now a year behind schedule compared with the Iraqi army. Next year \"has been declared as the year of the police\" and concentration will be on that force rather than the military."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
