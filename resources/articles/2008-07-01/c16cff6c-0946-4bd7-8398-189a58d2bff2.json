As chairman and chief executive of News Corporation Europe and Asia, he dominates the press and publishing top 10 due to his role as head of his father's News International newspaper empire, the UK's largest national newspaper group. James has already put his stamp on News International, flattening the commercial management structure. He is axing jobs in commercial and editorial services, but editorial remains untouched. Expect other changes as Murdoch knits together News Corporation's disparate divisions, including Dow Jones and Harper Collins, into what is likely to be a combined new London headquarters. Marketing spend will also be boosted across the News International titles. He has leap-frogged his father Rupert, who slips to number five overall in the MediaGuardian 100 and third in the press and publishing top 10. However, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation still exerts a powerful influence on Britain, as evidenced by the roll call of the great and the good who attended his summer party last month. Murdoch Sr will hope 2008 is the year his titles reap the benefits of his \u00a3650m investment in new colour presses. The Associated Newspapers editor-in-chief and Daily Mail editor, Paul Dacre, easily the most powerful journalist in the country, rules over an almost military-style operation. After a bout of ill health that prompted talk that he would relinquish the editorship, Dacre has defied the rumourmongers to increase his influence. Second in the sector ranking, he is now fourth on the main list, up from 10. Fourth on the MediaGuardian 100 press and publishing list for 2008 is the Pearson chief executive, Dame Marjorie Scardino. More than a decade at the top of the company and growing profitability at Pearson's Financial Times Group sees Scardino up from 41 to 26 on the main list. And those rumours about selling the FT have gone away too. Fifth is Viscount Rothermere, the chairman of Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, who appeared in front of the House of Lords communications committee earlier this year. He told the Lords that he would have faith in his editor-in-chief, even if Dacre wanted to legalise cannabis. He rises two places this year in the main list. When will the Sun editor, Rebekah Wade, move upstairs? Many staff thought it would be when her new boss James Murdoch reorganised the commercial side of Wapping, given her growing interest in this key area of the newspaper game and the fact she has accompanied him on a number of business trips. But while price cutting and story scoops have kept the Sun's circulation above 3m and Wade's future is assured, she has slipped seven places on the main list to number 30 and is sixth on the sector list. Rupert Murdoch has asked his favourite editor to stay in her job until the next election. Aidan Barclay is the lowest profile figure in the press and publishing top 10, possibly the lowest profile in the MediaGuardian 100. He makes his debut at 33 on our main list, seven in the press and publishing sector, replacing his father and uncle, Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay. Next is Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, the parent company of the Guardian, who has jumped 11 places on the main list to 35 after she transformed GMG with its \u00a31bn purchase of Emap's business-to-business titles with private equity group Apax. The Trinity Mirror chief executive, Sly Bailey, is enduring a horror month, with the Daily Mirror publisher's share price plunging after a profit warning, but she still makes number 38 on the list and ninth place in the press and publishing top 10. Will Lewis rounds out our press and publishing top 10. After pioneering newspaper integration at the Telegraph Media Group, he was promoted to editor-in-chief, and he alone has survived the editorial turmoil at the top of the organisation that has seen a succession of editors come and go. Dropping out of the list from last year are Les Hinton and Robert Thomson, off to the US to oversee implementation of Rupert Murdoch's grand plans for Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
