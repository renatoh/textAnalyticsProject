The playing is world-class, the jam-session atmosphere palpable, recalling the 1960s Time No Changes Miles Davis quintet, and often veering into free jazz, too. Janisch's Precisely Now declares the Davis allegiance through the edgy drumming and oblique riff that arrive after his dramatic solo-bass opening, and in the Herbie Hancockish fluency with which Ortiz chases Colum's solo. Osby supplies Wayne Shorter-like insinuations, but he's fast, fluid and lyrical on Jitterbug Waltz, and elegantly enigmatic on Thelonious Monk's Ask Me Now. It's a jazz album to the bone, but the live vibe makes it feel almost as good as being there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
