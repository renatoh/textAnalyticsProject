The National Audit Office (NAO) says that despite a series of initiatives from Number 10, the quality of help and protection for children in need provided by councils in England has been \u201cunsatisfactory and inconsistent, suggesting systemic rather than local failure\u201d. The NAO criticises the government for what it calls \u201cpoor progress\u201d on its 2010 promise to overhaul child protection services in the wake of the Baby P controversy, and highlights its \u201cpiecemeal\u201d attempts to improve failing services. One in five council children\u2019s services departments are currently rated inadequate by Ofsted, while just 23% are judged to be good, the report says. As of last month Department for Education officials were formally intervening in 26 out of 153 local authority social work departments. Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \u201cSix years have passed since the department recognised that children\u2019s services were not good enough. It is extremely disappointing that, after all its efforts, far too many children\u2019s services are still not good enough.\u201d The national picture of wide variations in child protection quality and sluggish improvements emerges against a backdrop of rising demand for services in recent years. The number of youngsters on child protection plans rose by 94% over the past decade, the NAO said, with youngsters in deprived areas of the country 11 times more likely to be on a protection plan than those in the most affluent areas. The government has introduced a series of reforms to social work in recent years designed to reduce bureaucracy in frontline social work, introduce competition to the provision of core child protection services, and promote \u201cinnovation\u201d in social work practice with the ambition of improving the quality of all services by 2020. However, the NAO criticised ministers\u2019 \u201cpiecemeal\u201d arrangements for identifying and spreading good practice. \u201cWhile the Department [for Education] is not solely responsible for improving the widespread failings of the system it is the only body that can oversee and push systemic change. \u201cHowever, even taking into account the challenge of reforming services delivered through local authorities, and the time needed to achieve systemic improvements, so far the outcomes have been disappointing.\u201d The report finds that one of the main predictors of a good quality service was financial investment in ensuring manageable caseloads for social workers and retaining a stable local workforce. In most councils rated good a social worker had responsibility for 10 to 14 children in need, while in others the caseload could be as high as 35. Similarly, councils rated good had below average levels of vacancies and agency staff, while councils rated inadequate had above average levels. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cChildren must be kept safe from harm and since 2010 we have been making ambitious changes to improve our child protection system. We are now taking tough action to drive up standards in children\u2019s services across the country, stepping in when councils aren\u2019t doing well enough and linking them up with better-performing local authorities to share best practice. \u201cWe have also cut red tape so that social workers can spend more time actually supporting families. But we are going further and introducing new laws to strengthen protection for the most vulnerable children and transforming the support available to them, as set out in plans we published this summer.\u201d Ruth Allen, chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers said: \u201cThe report shows a concerning lack of consistency and quality of services across the country. More early intervention to robustly address concerns rather than waiting for Ofsted failure is a clear message and there is a pressing need for a strategy that enables improvement across all authorities. The current approach appears from the evidence to not be bringing about coherent, whole system change.\u201d Cllr Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cLooking after children and keeping them safe is one of the most important jobs that a council does, and local authorities have been working hard to deal with the significant increase in demand for child protection services in recent years. He added: \u201cLocal authorities have faced significant funding cuts over this same period, and with such a big rise in demand for services, it\u2019s vital that local authorities have the resources they need to keep children and young people safe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
