Palace have already made a bid of around \u00a33.5m for the Benin striker, who has scored 12 goals in 23 Championship appearances this season, but Blackburn are thought to want closer to \u00a36m. Gestede, 26, played no part in the 1-1 draw with Wigan on Saturday despite their initial bid being rejected. But his agent David Wancier is hopeful that a solution can be now be found. \u201cCrystal Palace made an offer to Blackburn last week but it was rejected,\u201d he told Guardian sport. \u201cNow the clubs have to discuss to try and find a solution. The player really wants to sign for Crystal Palace but is also committed to Blackburn. \u201cRudy has been enjoying this season and just wants to play football. He just wants the club to consider this great opportunity for him to achieve his ambition to play in the Premier League.\u201d A number of Premier League clubs have expressed an interest in Gestede, whose form in the Championship has picked up since he moved to Rovers from Cardiff a year ago. Hull City and West Bromwich Albion have made enquiries, while Queens Park Rangers - who had initially been resigned to operating purely in the loan market this month - are ready to offer \u00a32m plus their under-used former Blackpool winger, Matt Phillips, in part-exchange for the forward. Harry Redknapp is desperate to add another forward to the ranks to ease the pressure on Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, whose injury problems tend to limit his game-time. The Palace manager Alan Pardew is in the market for another striker despite signing Yaya Sanogo on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They have been told they will have to pay in excess of \u00a39m if they are to secure Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis from Swansea City, while Troy Deeney is not thought to be an option due to the \u00a310m price tag placed on his head by Watford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
