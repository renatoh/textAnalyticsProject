In other words, I've been thoroughly chilled-out at a very comfortable thirtysomething degrees celsius in the little visited Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique. But, stranger than my inertia, was my complete and utter inability to grasp time. I abandoned my talent for punctuality at Pemba airport - where all the wallclocks remained steadfastly stuck at six o'clock; a non-measurement of the here-and-now that told me this would be my kind of place. Pemba town is a small, sleepy thatched settlement on the coast of Mozambique. It is claimed to have the third biggest natural harbour on the planet after Sydney and Rio - but that geographical anomaly is its only similarity with the two metropolises. Apart from the stupendous harbour, Pemba is also the gateway to the Quirimbas archipelago, an outrageously pretty group of 31 islands that stretch up the north coast towards the Tanzanian border. A twin prop awaits me on the airport tarmac. It gurgles, then roars like a bomber from a 40s war movie as it shudders down the runway. The sound is evocative, it might be taking me back in time to Casablanca rather than across a few miles of bush and sea to Quirimba Island. The land below looks untouched by man; baobabs and scrub tumble down to white beaches and an ocean of preposterous, impossible azures. We buzz a few headless palm trees that look like so many puzzled telegraph poles and then land on a red-earth gash in thick, tropical undergrowth. I clamber into the back of a waiting pick-up, which bumps its way through endless coconut plantations, and jump out near a group of men lounging in the shade of an ancient tree. They're angling for a lift with me - in a skiff that will splash us to Quilalea island. Quilalea is not much more than a spot on the local map - and doesn't exist at all in the atlas I inspected at home. It's a tiny, exclusive resort that maintains its own time zone an hour later than the Mozambican mainland; an eccentricity that keeps it in tune with the sunrise. I was so blissed-out on my arrival that I didn't notice the hour's hiccup until it was pointed out to me - a watch is hardly necessary here. I take to spending my afternoons lolling around in a string bed working on my tan and reading; a languid, tiring occupation that's only relieved by a well-earned rum and Coke in the evenings. Supper is taken on the beach. During my idle chatter with the managers over lobster and wine, I'm told that a lion had wandered into Pemba town a month earlier. News travels slowly in these parts. I keep the doors to my bungalow wide open and have a solid, warm night's sleep and waken to a wonderful view of the ocean. My slow morning walk around Quilalea takes 40 minutes. The bush whirs and clicks - a frantic clockwork of newly wound insects are chirruping before the sun gets too hot. Through Heron Point, past a lacework of coral rock and on to Turtle Beach, I suddenly realise I have the place to myself. The quietness and solitude is intoxicating and I succumb to the overpowering lust for laziness on the small private beach outside my room. A twinge of guilt forces me to flap down the beach in fins and snorkel. Within a few metres, the coral is luminous and lilac, sulphuric and yellow, khaki and green. Sea-cucumbers and starfish stretch on the bottom as if sunbathing. A school of butterfly fish the colour of autumn leaves are joined by a sixth-form college of blue fish flurrying to a deeper part of the ocean. A lugubrious turtle minds his own business below me. I'm entranced. The next day a speedboat takes me to Ibo Island. An elegant blue bird stands nonchalantly on one leg watching my progress. The sniffy creature would look more at home sipping cocktails in a Manhattan drawing room than he does standing in an East African mangrove. There are just two small guest houses on Ibo; I stay in a banda - a hut made from local matting - at the Bela Vista. It's perfect, an idler's dream that immediately casts a sleepy spell over me. Ibo Island comes as a welcome and extreme contrast to the luxury of Quilalea. Once the Portuguese capital of Cabo Delgado province, the small town has since fallen into the most desolate and ruinous beauty. It is quite unlike anywhere I've ever visited. If you took Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's village of Macondo from A Hundred Years Of Solitude and transported it from the Catholic legend of South America to Africa's eastern flank, then you would go some way to understanding Ibo's overwhelming magic. All the roads have long since been reclaimed by nature and are mere ghosts of what they were, covered in a film of dust and grass. An ancient tumble-down villa has a car-less garage that hasn't been used in decades. The hollow walls of other homes, their roofs and floors long gone, gaze emptily into the vanishing streets towards the old cathedral. I peer through a small hole in the church door and see a solitary man sitting amid the marvellous decay. I rattle the knocker to attract his attention, but he doesn't stir; he might well be dead in front of the cobweb draped altar. It is romantic, charismatic and haunting. A remarkable town full of magnificent dereliction, tropical rot and equatorial stupor. Ibo seems to have been created for dawdlers like me. By three in the afternoon, its already weak pulse slows and the streets become deserted. I sit on the broken promenade, sagging in the heat like an old dog, and stare across the grassy road to the beach and the distant cathedral. Minutes stretch; Ibo's sorcery means that the small fragments of time I usually count in now have no end and tomorrow seems far, far away. I'm beyond chilled. I break Ibo's spell by cadging a lift on a fishing boat going to the mainland. The dhow creaks gently as it cuts through a sleepy sea freshly splashed out of a six-year-old's paintbox. It took two and a half sun-drenched hours to reach my destination. Galudo Base Camp is charming, a resort that's kicking the norm: it's eco and ethical and bang-on. Wedged between the endless bush and sea, it seems to be on the edge of the world. Large tents are simply furnished with a bed, clothes stand, desk and laundry basket - you need nothing more. My shower is behind a curved bamboo screen; an alfresco spout that gushes from an old can into a marble heart-shaped drain. Galudo village is about a mile away - and is central to the success of the Base Camp. Home to 1,500 people, it's an archetypal African community, spotlessly clean and blindingly optimistic. A lizard a yard long nonchalantly marched out of theundergrowth and slid into the village waterhole. None of the women or children washing took any notice of the visitor. The beach in front of Galudo Base Camp is 12km long, made of pure white coral sand and utterly deserted apart from me and one or two fishermen. Life here is ineffably lazy; nothing happens quickly. Food might be served when you eventually remember you're hungry; a drink will arrive with a story; and a smile is absolutely guaranteed. Who could want for more? It is impossible to get any more chilled, nor any more wound down.

After travelling for hours through plains covered only with thick Mozambican bush, the bridge is an intriguing possibility. I drive warily across - it's so narrow only one car at a time can pass. As soon as I set foot on Ilha de Mozambique, I realise the place has little to do with what could be expected from a tiny atoll of rocks and white sand set off Mozambique's remote northern coast. Far from being a simple paradise of beaches and palm trees, the island reveals itself as the most urban and sophisticated place in the region. The island used to be the capital of the Portuguese colony of Oriental Africa, and it was to mainland Mozambique what the brain is to its body, linked by a long spine in the form of a bridge. Walking around its streets is like visiting an open-air museum. Elegant examples of Portuguese colonial architecture - sun-warmed pink and ochre stucco town houses and churches - alternate with glimpses of turquoise sea. The remains of this fading world of empire jostle with traditional huts made of wattle and mud and the burgeoning tropical vegetation - palms, papayas and banyan trees. The town seems to live in a relaxed atmosphere, suspended between the splendour of ancient eras and the simple rhythms of village life. Most of the stone buildings have remained empty since the Portuguese left the country in 1975, and nature is now taking its revenge on cement and stones. Long exotic creepers climb up the walls and huge roots burst out of floors. I walk around the island looking for a place to stay. In 20 minutes I've crossed it from one end to the other without seeing another tourist. The list of guesthouses and hotels is certainly not long, but I am lucky. I find a charming room in a renovated Portuguese villa, called Patio dos Quintalinhos, set between an ancient mosque and a Christian orphanage. From outside you can't see much, but inside the place is stylishly decorated with a wooden fishing boat adapted as a sofa hanging from the living room ceiling, and a little swimming pool in the interior garden. The owner is an Italian architect called Gabriele, who moved to Ilha four years ago to work as a volunteer and is now busy restoring many of its ancient buildings. He's an expert on the island's architecture and he offers to take me on a tour. 'Have you ever heard of Latin Africa?' he asks me before going out. 'You'll see what I mean in a minute...' Gabriele and I while away the day in cafes where we are served strong espressos and delicious sweets made of crushed almonds mixed with sugar. A little after noon, we visit the teeming fish market and bargain for shrimps and crabs to give to the Patio cook to prepare for dinner. Cuisine here, like the language - still a Portuguese patois - and the music with its mixture of Brazilian and local rhythms, retain a Latin flavour unique in the region. After the cultural tour, I feel ready for a swim. Beaches around the island are busy with fishermen repairing their nets and selling their catch. For more solitude, Gabriele suggests that I take a dhow ride to Choqu - an idyllic beach back on the mainland. The only access is from the sea and, once there, the sole company I have on the miles of powdery white sand are hundreds of little crabs and shiny cowries. Later in the afternoon, I catch a ride from a fishing boat back to Ilha just in time to enjoy the sunset from the terrace of my guesthouse while sipping a cold 2M, the local beer. Gabriele is there, too, and we contemplate the view of the huge orange sun sinking into the sea to the melancholic notes of a muezzin calling for prayer.
