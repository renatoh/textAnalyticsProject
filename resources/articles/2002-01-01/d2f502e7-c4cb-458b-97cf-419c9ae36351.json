The mayor has been given emergency powers to deal with the damage caused by motorised water traffic which creates wash. The mayor said this week that he intended to begin by levying a tax on tourists and impose strict controls on motorised transport in the city's canals. Venice is still menaced by regular flooding from high tides in the lagoon, with some experts predicting it will sink altogether within a century. The national government has already said it will implement a long-delayed, multibillion-pound mobile flood barrier, despite objections from environmentalists who say that it will damage the ecological balance of the lagoon. There are plans to restrict parts of the Grand Canal to gondolas and rowing boats only. Fewer Gatwick trains Gatwick Express is reducing its early morning and evening service from tomorrow. The trains from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport will run every half hour from 4.30am to 6am when they will run every 15 minutes.

Protection awareness A campaign to promote ATOL (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing) coinciding with the peak summer holiday booking period this month and next, has been launched. The adverts, using the message \"ATOL - Don't Go Without\", remind holidaymakers to check that their travel company is protected by ATOL before they book air holidays or flights. ATOL is managed by the Civil Aviation Authority and gives comprehensive protection against losing money or being stranded abroad to people in the UK who buy air holidays and flights from tour operators. It is by far the largest travel-protection scheme in the UK, and the only one for flights and air holidays sold by tour operators. Out of Cuba Festival Cruises (020-7734 0005), last week became the first major cruise line in five years to use Cuba as its base. Its ship Mistral has departures on January 11, 18 and 25 for a seven-night Caribbean cruise including visits to Mexico and Gran Cayman. Prices from the UK, including flights via Madrid, start from \u00a3745, plus \u00a330 additional security charge.
