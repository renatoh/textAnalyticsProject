With Mr Howard pledging to retire as party leader by Christmas, the new closed sessions of the party's 197 MPs are intended to complement the existing 1922 committee of backbenchers. \"We accept we need to change, and this forum will be the place for that grown-up, civilised and disciplined debate,\" he told MPs. According to a Conservative spokesman, the private meetings - rather than the media - will be the place to have a \"united and disciplined debate\" about the future of the party. Today's briefing was also addressed by the party's controversial Australian election strategist, Lynton Crosby, who gave the party a \"straight-talking\" debrief on the past four weeks' campaigning. The strategist shared the results of private party polling conducted throughout the contest. It is thought to show that the Conservative \"brand\" remains damaged in the eyes of many voters. Mr Howard was more upbeat, telling his audience that the Tories \"fought a good campaign which was disappointing in not gaining enough seats to get a majority\". The meetings are expected to be held once a week, with each session addressed by one of the party's intake of 35 new MPs. Mr Howard's reshuffle on Wednesday saw promotions for two of the rising stars of the party likely to be in the running for the Tory crown - George Osborne as shadow chancellor and David Cameron as shadow education secretary - both still in their 30s. Other likely contenders are Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former cabinet minister who has returned to parliament after an eight-year absence; the current shadow home secretary, David Davis; and new shadow foreign secretary, Liam Fox. None have put their heads above the parapet as yet, preferring to wait until Mr Howard has reformed the rules for selecting the leadership candidates. Former leader but one, William Hague, brought in a ballot system which saw MPs narrow the shortlist down to two candidates, and the grassroots membership of around 300,000 Tories vote to decide the winner. That system was blamed for electing Michael Howard's predecessor, Iain Duncan Smith, who was popular among the activists but far from the frontrunner with MPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
