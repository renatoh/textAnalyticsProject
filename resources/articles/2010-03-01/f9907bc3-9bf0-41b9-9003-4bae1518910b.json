Yet a freak jogging accident nearly put paid to the tour's opening night extravaganza; the singer revealed on Twitter that she required a steroid injection in her knee to get her through this Birmingham show. The good news is: the knee sounds great. And though it's difficult to form an objective judgment about a voice once it's amplified to a level that could endanger light aircraft, you have to hand it to Jenkins that she is exceptionally game. She learned to tap dance for her tour with Darcey Bussell a couple of years ago; now she has acquired circus skills. There's a collective gasp as she is hoisted high into the air in the arms of an aerialist hanging from a leather strap. Jenkins has recently been seen dispensing advice on ITV's Popstar to Operastar, though she herself seems to be heading in the opposite direction, with a choice of material that ranges from the curious to the downright bizarre. It includes a version of Bob Marley's No Woman No Cry, which might better be titled No, Woman, Please Stop; and, just when you think it cannot get any stranger, she unleashes her inner goth with a histrionic version of Evanescence's angsty metal hit, Bring Me to Life. Tantalisingly, she also includes a selection from Bizet's Carmen, which suggests that her chest-register could actually cut the operatic mustard. Jenkins has the talent, and increasingly the charisma, to head in any direction she fancies. Whether that's a little fountain in Seville, or the water feature down the precinct with the other goths, is entirely up to her. At Newcastle Metro Arena tonight. Box office: 0844 493 6666.
