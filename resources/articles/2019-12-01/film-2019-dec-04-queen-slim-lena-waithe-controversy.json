Yet the debate sparked by actor and writer Lena Waithe\u2019s debut film, Queen &amp; Slim, is raising a series of questions about work created by black artists and the role of critics of color. Can black artists grow and become better if we don\u2019t honestly critique them? How will more daring, inventive black films ever get funded if we tear them apart? On the weekend of its release, filmgoers debated the pros and cons of the film. Some described Queen &amp; Slim as two-hours of \u201ctrauma porn\u201d, exploiting black pain and tragedy for mass consumption, while others celebrated the film\u2019s artistic merits, praising its highly stylized cinematography and high-stakes plot. The writer Clarkisha Kent, who covers black culture, calls the film \u201cBlack Lives Matter fan-fiction\u201d. \u201cWhy is death something we have to expect in all facets of our lives?\u201d Kent says. \u201cWe the people are more than our trauma, and we don\u2019t have to see it over and over like it\u2019s Groundhog\u2019s Day to understand that it\u2019s an issue. I feel like fiction should be an escape.\u201d Brooke Obie of Shadow and Act, a black-focused film blog, took issue with the film\u2019s violent conclusion. \u201cBlack people don\u2019t need a movie where we\u2019re unarmed and violently gunned down by the state to tell us that we\u2019re in danger of being framed and murdered by the police,\u201d Obie writes. \u201cWe know.\u201d The film has been widely reviewed, to mixed reactions. The black women\u2019s magazine Essence called Queen &amp; Slim \u201cthe black love story we need\u201d, the New York Times called it a \u201cthrilling shock\u201d and the Guardian described the film as \u201chit and miss\u201d. In her Vulture review, Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n calls the warm-colored, Dev Hynes-soundtracked film \u201ca beautiful object to behold but a hollow narrative to consider\u201d. But some of the responses to the review shocked her and encapsulated the hurdles critics of color face. \u201cI\u2019m never surprised about receiving pushback as a critic,\u201d Basti\u00e9n tells the Guardian. \u201cWhat surprised me was the depth of the vitriol and being called an Uncle Tom due to my Queen &amp; Slim review, which was a very fair one.\u201d \u201cEven if what you say is true, it\u2019s wrong for you to put down another sister\u2019s art publicly,\u201d a user tweeted at Basti\u00e9n in response to her criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for Black women to make [it] in Hollywood having Black saboteurs doing their dirty work.\u201d Basti\u00e9n says the attacks are emblematic of the hurdles a black female film critic can encounter. \u201cIt can be a fraught position,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of weight on your words because there aren\u2019t enough black critics at major publications and there is an expectation that you must support black art unilaterally with no regard for quality. I find this both condescending and patronizing for black art and black critics. But there\u2019s also a tremendous lack of respect you deal with as well.\u201d The backlash seemed to reach a fever pitch for Clarkisha Kent. \u201cPeople are so emotional [with Queen &amp; Slim] because of the scarcity we have to deal with when it comes to black films,\u201d Kent explains. \u201cIt takes for ever for some of these movies to get on to screen unless you know somebody who knows somebody. So people become instantly and unequivocally protective of them \u2013 maybe even without seeing the thing.\u201d The drama around the film was heightened as other controversies surrounding it resurfaced. Last weekend, the original casting call for Queen\u2019s character re-circulated online, describing the dark-skinned character: \u201cIf she were a slave she would\u2019ve worked on the fields.\u201d Then there were comments made by Waithe in which she appeared to disparage black cultural influences and exalt white-adjacent ones. \u201cI think the reason my voice is so weird and confuses people is because I study [Aaron] Sorkin, Spike Lee, Spike Jonze, and that makes me a little different than the person who only has black influences,\u201d she said in a quote that quickly went viral. Waithe has become an unexpected darling of Hollywood after her episode of Master of None, Thanksgiving, won an Emmy for outstanding writing for a comedy series. (Like the film, the episode was directed by Melina Matsoukas.) Waithe has gone on to produce and write a slew of buzzed-about projects, including The Chi for Showtime and Twenties, which will focus on a group of queer women, for BET. Of course, Queen &amp; Slim is not without its high-profile supporters. Roxane Gay, author of Bad Feminist, gave the film a glowing reviewin her profile of Matsoukas. Beyonc\u00e9, Solange and Rihanna (a trio Matsoukas has directed music videos for) attended the film\u2019s premieres. Kent is quick to clarify that she wants to see Queen &amp; Slim\u2019s director and screenwriter succeed. \u201cBlack critics don\u2019t have it out for you,\u201d she says, almost exasperated. \u201cWe want to help you. That\u2019s why we say these things.\u201d She issues a challenge to Hollywood: \u201cMake films where none of the black characters die.\u201d Despite its controversy, Queen &amp; Slim was a success at the box office this weekend. The modestly budgeted film slightly beat box office predictions, earning $16m. But Basti\u00e9n hopes Hollywood execs glean a lesson from the intense dialogue around the film. \u201cI hope it shows Hollywood that it isn\u2019t enough to merely have black people in front of and behind the camera,\u201d Basti\u00e9n says. \u201cThat the work needs to rise to the occasion. I think the pushback shows how hungry black folks are for meaningful, complex representation.\u201d She wants work that features black characters as thriving, myriad figures. As Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s character says in one scene of Queen &amp; Slim, munching on a burger and disgusted with the never-ending catch-22s of being black in America: \u201cWhy do black people always have to be excellent? Why can\u2019t we just be us?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
