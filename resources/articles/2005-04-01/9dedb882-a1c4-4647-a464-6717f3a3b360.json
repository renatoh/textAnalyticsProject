Thanks to the success of sucralose, which is sold under the Splenda name, T&amp;L has enjoyed an incredible run over the past year. The company re-entered the FTSE 100 in December and a couple of months later its shares hit a seven-year high after Coca-Cola revealed plans to launch a new version of Diet Coke using Splenda. The stock eased 5.5p to 490p yesterday after Goldman Sachs downgraded it to underperform from in-line and set a 422p target price, citing concerns about generic competition. Based on research conducted by an Oxford academic and patent company, Goldman warned clients that a copycat version of sucralose could be on the market in 2006. It also noted that two Chinese companies already claim to be able to produce large quantities of the sweetener. Traders added that T&amp;L shares had also been affected by a warning from rival AB Foods, down 8.5p to 758p, that reform of the EU sugar regime is likely to happen next summer. In the wider market, leading shares bounced back from Monday's 64-point fall to close in positive territory for the first time in four sessions. The FTSE 100 closed 28.5 points higher at 4,855.6, lifted by a strong performance from the mining sector and a recovery on Wall Street following strong results from Coca-Cola and Texas Instruments. Rumours of corporate activity at a blue-chip company also helped support the index. Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle rose 11.25p to 480.75p amid talk of an approach from rival SABMiller, up 5.5p to 799p. Meanwhile, Wm Morrison gained 5.25p to 204.75p on gossip that former Asda boss Allan Leighton was sounding out the retailer's two biggest institutional shareholders, Brandes and Capital Group, about installing a new management team. On Monday, Brandes revealed it had increased its holding in Morrison to 9.3%. However, analysts were sceptical of the story. The FTSE 250 rallied 67.6 points to 6,999.1 and the FTSE Small Cap index rose 14.3 points to 2,869.9. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed around 101.330, yielding 4.587%. Somerfield, the supermar ket, proved to be the day's main talking point as its shares slipped 5.25p to 196.75p on rumours that takeover talks had collapsed. Traders reckoned a more likely explanation for the fall was that a wealthy individual shareholder had been forced to liquidate his position in Somerfield to cover losses sustained in another stock, rumoured to be Woolworths, which rose 1.25p to 39.5p yesterday. On a brighter note, there were further gains for Stanley Leisure. Its shares jumped 17% on Monday following news of a \u00a3500m approach for its gaming division from rival William Hill, up 8p to 566p. They gained another 7p to 559p yesterday after Malaysian gaming group Genting added 1.74m shares to its holding in Stanley, now 19% of the company. The news excited casino operator London Clubs International, up 5.5p to 122.5p. Traders believe Genting will put pressure on Stanley Leisure to use the proceeds from the deal with William Hill to launch a bid for LCI. Genting has also built a 22% stake in LCI. Hanson, the building materials group, was marked 7.5p higher at 496p on hopes tomorrow's strategy presentation will be accompanied by positive news on cost-cutting. Electrocomponents, the electronics components distributor, rose 4.75p to 239p after CSFB told clients the stock, which has underperformed the market by 15% over the past month, had been oversold. Among the smaller companies, Corin Group, the orthopaedic devices specialist, gained 15p to close at 352p on rumours of a bid approach. Corin held takeover talks with a mystery suitor last year but they ended in a disagreement over price. Antisoma, the biotech that focuses on finding new cancer drugs, firmed 0.75p to 22.75p after receiving clearance from US regulators to start phase II clinical trials of its AS1404 product for prostate cancer. The stock was also helped by broker Nomura clearing an overhang of 2m shares. French Connection firmed 2.5p to end at 285.5p amid talk that Icelandic investment group Baugur is looking to pick up a large chunk of stock, possibly as much as a 10% stake. Still in the retail sector, Homestyle gained 2p to 90.5p despite fears that Debenhams will close the Bensons beds concessions in the eight stores it recently purchased from the administrators of Allders. On Aim, Lennox Holdings, a wholesaler of British expats' favourites such as Marmite and PG Tips to retailers in Spain, was one of the top performers. Its shares, which came to market in December at 45p, gained 6.5p to 58p after the investment website T1ps.com advised readers to buy and set a one-year target price of 105p. Shell company Caplay marked time at 2.65p despite a block of 11m shares changing hands at 2.5p. Traders reckon the seller may have been Terry Ramsden, who retains a holding of 16.7m shares. Speculation lifts supports Bid speculation was swirling round the support services sector yesterday. Two companies were in focus - science and engineering group AEA Technology and Hyder Consulting. AEA shares gained 1.5p to 92.5p on rumours that its recent disastrous profits warning, which saw 25% wiped off its market value and triggered the departure of its chief executive, had left it vulnerable to an approach and that predators were circling. Meanwhile, Hyder Consulting climbed 9.5p or 4.8%, to 207p on rumours that it had received an offer from its rival WS Atkins. Hyder Consulting was demerged from Welsh utility group Hyder in 2001 and helps public sector bodies and companies develop and build infrastructure projects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
