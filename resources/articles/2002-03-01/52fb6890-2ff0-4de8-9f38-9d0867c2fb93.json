The Welshman, 35 last month, had planned to bring down the curtain last summer but was so disappointed with his form during the season, including finishing a disappointing fifth in the Olympic 110 metres hurdles final, that he reconsidered. But he insists that however well he runs during the next 12 months he will then retire. \"I genuinely thought that that was not a very good way to finish an athletics career which had been so successful and spanned so long,\" he said. \"Last season was so rubbish, really atrocious for me, but I started training again and felt good. I'm still capable of winning major championships so I thought I'd have a go.\" After successful treatment on an achilles injury, Jackson - the current world record holder at 110m hurdles and 60m hurdles indoors - has looked fresher and more invigorated this winter than he had for three years. He tops the world rankings in the 60m hurdles with 7.44sec and is the favourite to regain a title he won in 1989 and 1994. His main opposition is expected to be Austria's Elmar Lichtenegger, an occasional training partner. Jackson also plans to com pete in the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in July and the European championships in Munich. If he maintains his motivation he may be persuaded to carry on until the world indoor championships in Birmingham next February, but then he must stop. \"Come what may, that's it. I have a project starting in April,\" said Jackson, who plans to set up a motivational speaking business with his friend Mark McKoy, the 1992 Olympic 110m hurdles champion. He also hopes to make a film starring his sister, the former Brookside actress Suzanne Packer. Jackson is one of several British athletes, among the relatively small team of 21, who have medal-winning chances in these championships. Daniel Caines, Christian Malcolm and Doug Turner are each capable of winning the 200m; John Mayock is hoping to regain the 3,000m title he last won in 1998; the pole vaulter Nick Buckfield tops the European rankings; and the triple jump world record holder Ashia Hansen is returning to her best form. Britain will also have the two fastest men in Europe on show in the 60m after Mark Lewis-Francis was told he could stay to race his team-mate Jason Gardener, the defending champion. The teenager failed to attend court in Wolverhampton on Wednesday to answer motoring charges and a warrant for his arrest was issued. But UK Athletics said it had spoken to the court and the 19-year-old world 100m junior champion could remain in Austria for the championships. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
