O'Leary has identified a new keeper as a priority at Villa and Robinson emerged under his management at Elland Road. Villa have already made a tentative enquiry about Robinson's availability but a bid may be more than a month away. Villa share the universal desire to avoid paying hefty wages over the summer and Robinson's salary may yet be a stumbling block to the transfer. Arsenal have also shown in-terest in Robinson, who would prefer to play in the Champions League, but his wages are also a deterrent to Highbury. Robinson used to live beside O'Leary in Harrogate and the two remained in contact after O'Leary was sacked by Leeds last summer. O'Leary was in Yorkshire yesterday, rather than in Canada as had been reported. Barnsley's owner Peter Doyle is hoping to complete the sale of his club on Monday to a consortium headed by the former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale. Ridsdale, who left Leeds under a cloud in March, leaving behind an \u00a380m debt, has made no secret of his desire to get back into football. He was recently given a tour of Oakwell and although Doyle said on Thursday that it \"hung on a knife edge\", he insisted a deal could soon be struck. Fans will be barred from buying tickets for England's next two away Euro 2004 qualifiers but the Football Association has insisted it is not trying to impose a permanent ban on travelling to matches abroad. The FA last night confirmed it will not make tickets available for the match in Macedonia on September 6, in keeping with last month's decision for the game in Turkey on October 11. Paul Barber, the FA's communications director, said: \"The FA urges England supporters not to travel to Macedonia but to watch the match live on the BBC. Anyone who ignores the advice and travels to Macedonia regardless, risks being banned for life from attending future England matches. It is the FA's intention to make tickets available to England fans for our next away match, which is currently scheduled to be a friendly international in Portugal on February 18 2004.\" Oldham last night declared they are \"on the verge of going out of business\", barely a week after the major shareholder Chris Moore said he could no longer bankroll the club, which is losing \u00a350,000 a week. The Republic of Ireland's 2-1 win in the European Under-21 Championship qualifier with Albania was overturned last night after Uefa ruled their captain Liam Miller had played when suspended. Albania have been awarded a 3-0 win. \u00b7 England's Under-20 team crashed to a humiliating 8-0 defeat by Argentina last night. England, without their star names because of European Under-21 qualifiers, lost 3-0 to Portugal in their first game and next face Turkey tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
