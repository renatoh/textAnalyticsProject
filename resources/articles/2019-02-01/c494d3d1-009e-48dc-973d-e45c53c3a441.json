Nowadays it is less a case of \u201cmay\u201d than \u201cwill\u201d when the Leicester wing hurtles towards a try-line, to the point where Wales will have to make special plans for England\u2019s prolific flyer in Cardiff this weekend. Give him half a yard and he will \u2013 not may \u2013 take full advantage. Twelve tries in his last dozen Tests, including a hat-trick inside the opening 29 minutes against France last time out, is a world-class strike rate by anyone\u2019s standards. The last time he faced Wales he scored twice at Twickenham, the only tries of a low-scoring game. His tally of 22 tries in 42 Tests has elevated him to seventh on the list of England\u2019s all-time try scorers, with the power to edge past, among others, Jason Robinson\u2019s 28 in 51 Tests by the end of the year. Not that \u201cedge past\u201d is May\u2019s modus operandi. The 28-year-old is flying, to the point where France seemed petrified any time the ball came within 10 metres of him. \u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s true,\u201d he says, when asked if his form is having a psychological effect on opponents. Never mind English rugby, there is no more improved player in the world over the past 12 months. Even May himself is delighted by the eye-catching progress he is making. While his scorching effort against New Zealand at Twickenham in 2014 is still among his favourite tries, he now has many more strings to his bow. \u201cI am a different player to what I was,\u201d he acknowledges, quick to stress his good fortune to be on the end of an increasingly dangerous attacking backline. \u201cI have scored a lot in my last 12 Tests, more than in my first 30. Is that luck? Maybe it is, but I know my game is better and tries come with that.\u201d It has also done him no harm that the game is tilting towards greyhounds like him who are alert, keen and quick enough to chase down well-executed attacking kicks. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the game\u2019s gone at the moment,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cPeople want 14 men in the frontline with aggressive defences and players getting off the line. Where does that leave the space? A lot of the time it\u2019s behind them. Will the game change? In 10 years\u2019 time maybe it\u2019ll go back to putting wings back and softer defences. But the way we want to be thinking is: \u2018We\u2019re not robots, where is the space?\u2019 There\u2019s always going to be some somewhere.\u201d His burgeoning confidence is a far cry from his early England days when he was mostly happy just to be there. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doubting myself but I knew in the back of my head that I was running out of chances. I knew there was pressure on me. I could do it at Gloucester but hadn\u2019t quite done it here.\u201d He has worked hard to turn himself into a player capable of more than just the odd champagne moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s been a little bit funny to me is everyone saying \u2018wow\u2019 now whereas I feel it hasn\u2019t happened overnight. I feel like I\u2019ve been working hard over a long period of time.\u201d The next goal is to be mentioned in the same breath as New Zealand\u2019s Ben Smith \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s the smartest rugby player\u201d \u2013 and to distance himself from scurrilous rumours that he was once, ahem, possessed by a chicken. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit silly isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t think at any stage that has happened,\u201d says May, blushing ever so slightly. This week, instead, he is focused on scoring for the fifth consecutive Six Nations game, further buoyed by a pep talk from the former England and Chelsea captain John Terry, who attended training in Bagshot on Tuesday. \u201cHe spoke a lot about the leadership group he had at Chelsea. A core group of players setting the standard and how Jos\u00e9 Mourinho came in and changed the way they train. It was quite reassuring because we could relate to a lot of things he was saying.\u201d Not so reassuring for Wales as they prepare to meet English rugby\u2019s answer to Didier Drogba."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
