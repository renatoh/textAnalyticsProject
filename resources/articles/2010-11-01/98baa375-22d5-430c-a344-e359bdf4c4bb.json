But this week, as part of Wynton Marsalis's week-long residency at the Barbican, I'm directing two British bands for a couple of swing dance nights, and a history of British big-band music. Wynton, Cleo Laine, Stan Tracey, and Harry Beckett, a trumpeter who encouraged me as a kid, are among many guest artists at the Barbican. We celebrate a fascinating week of music backstage afterwards, but I've got a cab coming at 4am to take me to the airport. I'm going to Philadelphia to start Phil Collins's Motown tour of the States. I seem to compose and arrange more than I play nowadays, but I'm looking forward to being a trumpeter again. Late June Roseland Ballroom, West 52nd Street, New York. The crowd's dancing to all those great Motown songs. Phil Collins has been meticulously recording every rehearsal so that we get the songs he first loved as a teenager just the way he wants. Three guys from the original Motown sessions, whose storytelling is as good as their playing, are in the band. We do 26 songs in a 90-minute set that feels like 10 minutes. 1 August I share a study in my Chiswick flat with a piano, an Apple Mac, piles of manuscript paper and, often, my wife Davina. She doesn't mind working while I'm next to her with sampled sounds blaring. She's written a book about creativity and dreams \u2013 Wagner solved opera problems that way, Paul McCartney dreamed Yesterday. But without the power of a good dream, all I have is that scary blank sheet, and the knowledge that I also have to write a 54-minute guitar concerto for Martin Taylor for a concert in Liverpool the week after Jazz Voice. My trumpet sits looking at me like a whimpering dog. They say you notice it if you don't practise the trumpet for a day, two days and the band notices it, three days and so does the audience. Fortunately, there aren't too many trumpet gigs in the diary. Mid August John Cumming and Amy Pearce from Serious \u2013 who produce the London jazz festival \u2013 say the 16-year-old Canadian Nikki Yanofsky and Gretchen Parlato from New York may do Jazz Voice, likewise Dee Dee Bridgewater's daughter China Moses. There are also some potential surprises \u2013 as every year. Jamie Cullum was a spectacular one in 2008, bringing the house down with Ray Charles's I Got a Woman. Georgie Fame is the first definite confirmation. All the Jazz Voice songs have to relate to the year we're in \u2013 a 50th anniversary, a 100th birthday, that kind of thing. We decide on Everything Happens to Me, and I'm Always True to You in My Fashion, off a Peggy Lee/George Shearing album that's one of Georgie's favourites. Peggy would have been 90 this year. He sends me the lyrics, handwritten, in the post. My first arrangements for Jazz Voice are finally under way. 10 September Nikki Yanofsky's in town, at Soho's Pizza Express, and she seems to own the stage. Her musical director Rob Fahie tells me he's been on the road with her for ages.\"What do you mean?\" I ask him. \"She's barely 16.\" \"Since she was 11,\" he says. The singer Ian Shaw's at the bar and I say, \"Imagine what she'll be like, when she's a real mature woman, 40 or something, singing with all that experience going back to now,\" and he's going, \"Yeah, yeah, what?\" \"We'll be dead,\" I tell him. Nikki sings Over the Rainbow as an encore. I'd love to have her do that on Jazz Voice. I'm sure we can find some kind of date-pretext for it. Late September I have a gig with Stan Tracey's quintet. I do what I always do when I need to get some stamina back \u2013 call my trumpeter neighbour Martin Shaw, and we practise a couple of hours of classical duets over a few afternoons. But Stan's is a 75-minute set, and I'm still wilting by halfway. 5 October The great teacher Nadia Boulanger said composition is as much about taking things out as putting things in. On some pieces, I'm at that revision stage now. I also have to get every tiny detail right, because there's not that much rehearsal time. But I'm starting to get a worsening pain in my arm, and it gets to the point where I can't write at all. It's trapped nerves from sitting in one position for two months, and I'm recommended acupuncture. During it I get dizzy and sick, black out and end up on the floor \u2013 dimly thinking, this is ridiculous, I only came here for my arm. But gradually, over about a week I can't afford to have lost, the pain goes away. 18 October To the Albert Hall to conduct Paloma Faith singing with the Royal Philharmonic. I first worked with Paloma at the Cheltenham jazz festival in May, when I arranged 18 songs for her, from Lover Man to her own hits, a lot of songs about being dumped. She decided to run on stage crying, and throw her shoes into the audience at Cheltenham, with thunder and lightning effects going on. It's a little more restrained at the Albert Hall, but it's a great night, and it gives me a few hours out of that room. Late October The Martin Taylor concerto and most of the Jazz Voice arrangements are finally done, except for a birthday-celebrating instrumental medley for Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rollins, and the late Charlie Parker's 90th \u2013 but I'm stuck for a beginning and ending for it. At the bar at Ronnie Scott's, Joe Paice from Jazz Services reminds me that Kenny Wheeler is 80. So I'll do a symphonic version of Kenny's beautiful Everybody's Song But My Own to begin and end the medley. 6 November It's Saturday, and the gig's next Friday night \u2013 I'm much closer to the wire than usual. China Moses is touring, so can't make Wednesday's piano rehearsal, Gretchen Parlato's commitments mean she'll arrive on the morning of the show \u2013 but Herbie Hancock's Butterfly is part of her repertoire, so it'll be a breeze for her. I wake on Saturday at 3am, and put the final touches to the last two arrangements. At 10am they're all done, and I hear the email whoosh as it goes off to the copyist to be printed. I go out for a capuccino, then crash out on the sofa for three hours. Later on, at the copyist's, there are piles of music on every surface. \"Now look what you've done,\" he says. We put all the parts into folders, and into this huge suitcase, which I'll take to the rehearsals and hand out to the players. But it's all just dots on paper until the orchestra brings it to life, until I'm on the podium seeing the cameraderie of the singers in the wings, applauding each other as they come offstage. Naturally, those are the best moments of all. Until the next time. Guy Barker was talking to John Fordham. Jazz Voice is at the Barbican, London (020-7638 8891), on 12 November. The London jazz festival runs until 21 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
