The world No2 travelled to China for the season's first event, the Shanghai Masters, but was unable to compete because of a torn shoulder muscle. Defeat by Ding Junhui in the last 16 of the grand prix in Glasgow saw his provisional ranking down to seventh with a third of the skeletal ranking circuit completed. Here in Telford he has been coping with the death last week of his grandfather, Paddy, who provided him, as a boy, with a table to practise on by knocking down an inner wall of his house. Maguire's game exudes class and he has four ranking titles to his name but there is still a sense that the circuit has not seen the best of him in a sustained way. Lines, 40, appearing in his first quarter-final for 10 years, departed with the highest cheque of his career, \u00a316,450, a pleasant change from having to supplement meagre prize-money from a handful of tournaments with bar shifts and brushing and ironing tables at his base, the Northern Snooker Centre, Leeds. Playing on television for the first time for seven years, Lines \"didn't really notice\" the television cameras but added that \"it was a lot hotter than it was on the outside tables. It was roasting, even when I was just sat in my chair.\" Having beaten two members of the top sixteen, the out-of-form Marco Fu 9-3 and the by no means out-of-form Mark Williams, 9-8 on the final black, he still found Maguire a step up in class: \"He cues the long ones so sweet,\" he said. \"Against Marco and Mark I got away with a few mistakes but Stephen punished me for almost every one.\" He reduced daunting arrears of 7-2 to 7-5 but Maguire stepped on the gas with a 108 break in what duly proved to be the penultimate frame. Allister Carter, whose defence of the Welsh Open title falls due next month, became the 32nd player to record a century of centuries in competition as his 124 assisted him to a 3-0 lead over Ding but fell 4-3 behind before he led 7-5. At 7-7, Carter made 74 but Ding produced two cool frame winners of 95 and 76 to prevail 9-8 and go through to tomorrow's semi-final against Maguire. Tomorrow's quarter-finals are Ronnie O'Sullivan v Mark Selby and John Higgins v Liang Wenbo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
