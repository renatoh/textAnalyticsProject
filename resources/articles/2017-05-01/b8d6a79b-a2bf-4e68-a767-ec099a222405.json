The Argentinian has been at City for nine years and is out of contract from 1 July. He has told City he will move on in the summer and the fixture against West Brom on Tuesday evening will be the defender\u2019s last home appearance. Zabaleta has made 332 appearances since signing for \u00a36.5m from Espanyol the day before it was announced that Sheikh Mansour was the club\u2019s new owner and he made his debut for City in September 2008. Reports suggested the 32-year-old is lining up a move to West Ham.
