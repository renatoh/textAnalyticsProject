This week Jorge Mendes said: \u201cThe truth is, right now we don\u2019t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play in one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not.\u201d Falcao was dropped for Sunday\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Southampton at Old Trafford, and the Colombian has scored only three times in 13 appearances for United. Asked about Mendes\u2019s remarks, Val Gaal said he was not interested what the agent said but it was an unhelpful intervention. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t interest me. I think it is the obligation of the manager that you observe, analyse your selection, that you make a game plan, that you communicate with your players, then you make a decision that the players understand but that is not so easy. Now you are only talking about Falcao but do you think about Januzaj? Lindegaard?\u201d the manager said, referencing two other players not in Sunday\u2019s game-day 18. Van Gaal is adamant that if United are to pay Monaco around \u00a343m to sign Falcao permanently the 28-year-old has to earn the move. \u201cHe has to prove himself,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cWe have agreed because of that we have made this deal and everything is clear and it is not till the end of the year so he has a chance for that. It is the quality of the training sessions and quality in his matches [that counts]. If a player cost \u00a395m or \u00a35,000 it is not any difference for me. A player of \u00a395m has to prove yourself too. I have to be like that. It is difficult for the outside world to understand. I think he [Falcao] is generally happy. \u201cI have spoken to him but I always speak with the players. I am a good communicator, so that is not a big exception,\u201d the 63-year-old said. \u201cBut he was not in the squad, so then you talk more with this kind of player because for them it is a big disappointment. I wanted to explain what he has to do in the future.\u201d Robin van Persie\u2019s ankle problem could offer Falcao a route back into the side. \u201cYou will have to wait and see,\u201d Van Gaal added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
