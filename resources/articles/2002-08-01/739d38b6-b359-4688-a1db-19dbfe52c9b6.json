They chose laughter at Highfield Road on Thursday, officials of Coventry City being mightily amused by the lunchtime news that their former chairman Bryan Richardson had been appointed at Derby County \"to bring in some financial stability\" to Pride Park. They laughed aloud because, when Richardson departed Coventry eight months ago, the club had debts of around \u00a360m and plans to build a 42,000-seater stadium had stalled. The new ground was conceived in healthy Premiership times. Last season Coventry finished mid-table in the First Division with an average crowd of 15,436. Stable it is not. To please the banks, Coventry have sold Magnus Hedman to Celtic this summer and lost other big earners off the pay-roll such as Gary Breen. Lee Hughes and David Thompson will be next. These, of course, are the players who might get them promoted. In return Coventry have bought no one, part of the new reality. In their first year outside the top flight since 1967 they got through three managers - Gordon Strachan, Roland Nilsson and, briefly, Steve Ogrizovic all taking charge - and money was spent. Hughes alone cost \u00a35m but Coventry are now into their second and last year of parachute payments from the Premier League. The gloom should be so thick one cannot see the doom, yet August in itself brings that strange fresh hope all fans experience. There are reasons to be positive: for one, the new boardroom caution is commendable, even if there is no alternative. Then there is Gary McAllister, back at Coventry not only as a player but as the manager, too. Last seen in Liverpool red, the 37-year-old has opted for Coventry's rather different red. In his first ever game as a manager Sheffield United visit Highfield Road today. This was not McAllister's plan. Three-and-a-half months ago he had merely been searching for a 22nd season of regular first-team football, worried that he might too often be unemployed at Anfield. \"I'd started to get my feelers out\" was how he put it and, when McAllister began discussions with Coventry, it was solely about being their player again. The conversation clearly went well: McAllister ended up as manager and, as such, he is free to pick himself. He will. It could well prove to be the division's signing of the season. Why anyone would want to enter the trade at such an insecure time, though, is the obvious question. McAllister had a pretty secure answer: \"I was asked and I was honoured to be asked. I was coming toward the end of my contract with Liverpool and I wasn't featuring as much as I'd like. Liverpool briefly spoke of me staying another year but I felt I'd play less games. Ideally I just wanted to be a player, so the management thing was a big surprise. But when someone gives you the chance to come in at this level and manage...it's not as if I'm coming in way down the leagues. This is a quality club and I'm working with good players.\" McAllister played 140 games for Coventry between 1996 and 2000 before leaving on the sort of Bosman-free transfer that has hurt clubs of Coventry's stature. At Anfield he experienced an Indian summer of Sachin Tendulkar proportions but this is a very different Coventry from the one he joined six years ago from Leeds. The Sky Blues may have appeared annual strugglers in the Premiership but within two years of McAllister's arrival they finished 11th and, 12 months on, they spent \u00a36m buying Robbie Keane from Wolves. Those, sadly, turned out to be the days. McAllister is not blinding himself to the fact. Appointed three days after the end of last season, he said: \"I was made very well aware of the financial situation at the club by the chief executive and the chairman and even that didn't frighten me off. It's not got any better since but I still feel we've got enough to make a challenge. \"I don't think it's any different at other clubs. Maybe the ones that came out of the Premier League are in a stronger position but they're now having to cope with big wage bills and they've got the pressure to bounce straight back up. So it's more of a level playing field, I think. I don't think we're much worse off than most.\" McAllister did not want to dwell on economics; he is here to play football, coach and manage. Eric Black has been brought south as assistant from McAllister's first club, Motherwell, and the division of McAllister's time has been one early priority. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday he will be a manager and coach but by Thursday \"I should be focusing on my own game. It'd be foolish to think I could do tactical stuff on a Friday.\" This Wednesday had partly been spent bringing Bulgaria's goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov over on trial, Dean Gordon from Middlesbrough being the only player signed permanently by McAllister so far - for nothing, naturally. He is getting used to scratching around, watching videos, reading cvs, but a call to G\u00e9rard Houllier asking for some stars on loan proved fruitless. \"I tried. The problem getting quality players out of the bigger clubs is that they can carry 35 players comfortably on the wage bill.\" Houllier will, though, still have an impact on Coventry this season. Twenty-one years in the profession have provided McAllister with every sort of manager but he said: \"To be honest, the last couple of seasons is the first time I've played under the foreign influence and that really turned my head, the psychological stuff, the theory. Importance is placed on every single little detail, no matter how irrelevant it seems.\" Pre-season friendlies - \"the propaganda\", according to McAllister - have revealed a Liverpool style orchestrated by the new No10. \"It's not rocket science, to be perfectly honest: we will place a lot of emphasis on trying to keep possession of the ball. I would absolutely disagree with the idea that in this division you can't play football like that. \"In the last two seasons two teams who have won promotion, Fulham and Manchester City, have footballed their way out. They embarrassed teams by playing football. We're not going to weave pretty patterns for the sake of it, we want to play winning football, but the emphasis will be on trying to keep the ball. That's how we see it.\" Keeping it, not squandering it: it is about time that happened at Coventry City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
