The Briton was drawn against Alex Corretja but the Spaniard has flown to Barcelona, where his girlfriend has given birth. Corretja, who was playing at an exhibition event at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire, will decide by the weekend whether to return, although last night family members indicated that he would return. Should he stay in Spain his place will go to a lucky loser from the qualifying tournament. Albert Costa has withdrawn from Wimbledon with a knee injury and the draw has been altered as a result. Nikolay Davydenko takes over Costa's No24 seeding and his place in the draw, where he was due to meet the British wild card Lee Childs in the first round. Davydenko's place will taken by a lucky loser. Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, has retired after a long run of injuries. The 31-year-old Dutchman won 17 titles and famously beat Pete Sampras on his way to his only grand slam title. Wimbledon has slashed the number of Centre Court tickets it sells on the morning of the middle Saturday from 2,000 to 500 in an effort to cut down on overnight queuing. Organisers blamed the \"enormous practical problems of maintaining control and ensuring health and safety\". As many as 9,000 fans camped out last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
