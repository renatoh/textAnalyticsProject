Set among the bucolic landscape of east Cork in Ireland, the school offers courses suitable for all levels and which take in everything from tea appreciation to a basic home-butchery course, by way of seafood and cooking for those with coeliac disease. Running the full gamut of the food chain, Ballymaloe also runs courses on keeping bees, chickens and organic gardening - it's rigorous, unfussy and very hands-on. For people who are serious about food (or those who would like to become so), the 12-week course might prove to be an effective career-change mechanism. Accommodation ranges from no-nonsense self-catering cottages to the sybaritic pleasures of staying at Ballymaloe, an acclaimed country-house hotel. \u00b7 Ballymaloe Cookery School (00 353 21 464 6785, www.cookingisfun.ie)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
