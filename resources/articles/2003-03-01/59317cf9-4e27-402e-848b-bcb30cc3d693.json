Unfortunately, his uniform was a blue and yellow anorak with colour-coordinated clipboard. Chauffeur is the name given by BCP to the person who parks your car in their Meet 'n' Greet service (bcponline.co.uk). It may not be grand, but it is very handy. You just drive your car up to the drop-off point outside the arrivals hall, where you are greeted by the \"chauffeur\" pushing a trolley. He helps you load on your bags while you de-car (as the Americans say) the kids and hand in the keys. Then he takes the car off to long stay, to await your return. When you return all tanned, you just call him up as you clear Customs, and he's there with your car at the drop-off point, ready to greet you again. Our chauffeur even gave me a welcoming hug, as if glad to see us safely home. It's particularly good for families, as it avoids the agonies of making your way to the long-stay car park. There's no clambering on and off coaches with pushchairs that refuse to fit through folding doors; no heaving of luggage from coach to car. And, although I always intend to pack warm clothes for the homeward journey, somehow we managed to arrive back from the Canaries in shorts and Tenerife T-shirts, making Gatwick at 2C feel like a physical assault. (The service is also available in the chilly climes of Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester.) The kids would have frozen if we'd had to trek through the airport's hinterland to find our our car. The additional expense is reasonable in the overall scheme of holiday costs - \u00a324.95 is added to your airport parking bill - especially as you have the pleasure of being able to say your chauffeur picked you up at the airport. \u00b7 Please send tips for sharing to travelwithkids@aol.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
