The left-arm spinner, who is attempting to be in contention for the Ashes series after three operations have kept him out of cricket all year, said: \"He doesn't get a lot of praise from this certain individual when the team does well, yet when we do badly it's all his fault. He has a huge amount to offer going into this really tough winter, and I've not played under any other coach who tries to look for newer ways to improve the game. 'Stale' or 'complacent' are words that are just ridiculous.\" Boycott had written in a newspaper column on Monday that England's defeat by Australia on Saturday showed that it was time for Fletcher to move on. \"The job comes with a shelf-life,\" he wrote. \"And Fletcher has just reached the end of his.\" Giles has not yet bowled in India expect for in the nets, and is still unable to take full part in fielding exercises. Yet he remains confident he would be ready if selected for the opening Test against Australia in Brisbane next month. Monty Panesar is the man in possession, but Giles sees no reason why they might not play together. \"We are very different left-arm spinners. Two create a lot more pace in the game and create pressure together. We could be a match-winning pairing.\" As for head-to-head rivalry, Giles is a much more accomplished batsman, and has been working hard in the nets to this effect. \"Monty has done well and it is up to me to get that place back. That's why I'm trying to impress in everything I do - bowling, batting and fitness. I don't have to sell myself to Fletch, Freddie and my other team-mates. My all-round game will help my cause, but Monty bowled beautifully in the summer.\" After operations on his hip and groin had brought no obvious progress, Giles committed himself in June to one final hip operation by a French-Canadian specialist in Denver. \"There have been times when I thought I might not play cricket again. I learned a lot about perspective,\" he said. \"I thought if the last operation didn't work out I'd not had a bad career, although now I'm desperate to get back.\" But then, mental fortitude is an integral part of the 33-year-old's make-up. Never a stranger to criticism, he has none the less played in more than 50 Tests and 60 one-day internationals. \"There would be nothing easier than to sit at home and think that the Ashes were going on and I didn't quite make it. I was desperate to get to India and now I've got my foot in the door.\" The only unenjoyable aspect has been watching his team-mates fail to find their form. \"You'd rather be struggling with them than watching. They are very frustrated. The Australia game was important, particularly with the Ashes coming up. If we were honest it was men and boys.\" So it has been Giles's job to encourage and cajole prior to the final Group A match against the West Indies here on Saturday. \"It's difficult for some of the youngsters. It can be devastating to be beaten by Australia and India like that.\" With only a few weeks left to the first Test in Brisbane, those who have been struggling with injury - Giles, Andrew Flintoff, and Steve Harmison - appear some way off being Ashes honed. It was something the England management vowed never to let happen against after the last Ashes tour, and it must be hoped that none of the trio's apparent confidence is misplaced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
