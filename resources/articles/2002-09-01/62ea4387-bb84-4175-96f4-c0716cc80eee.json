Second-half goals from Anthony McNamee and Dominic Foley, who ran 50 yards before taking his chance in injury-time, separated the sides. \"The first 25 minutes were probably the worst I've ever seen,\" said Watford's manager Ray Lewington. \"I thought we were going to get overrun.\" Rotherham remain in fourth place after a 0-0 draw with Reading, who moved up to eighth after a scrappy game at Millmoor. \"Chris Sedgwick was booked for kicking the ball away, which was disappointing, but when you have Premiership referees what do you expect?\" said Rotherham's manager Ronnie Moore, referring to Mark Halsey. \"He wanted Lucozade rather than water before the game.\" Wigan Athletic moved back to the top of the Second thanks to Brentford's home draw with Luton and their own 3-0 win over Wycombe. Lee McCulloch scored with a tap-in after three minutes before Andy Liddell's double made him the division's top scorer with five. Two goals in five second-half minutes put Blackpool on the way to a 3-0 victory over Tranmere at Bloomfield Road. Keith Southern, on loan from Everton, and John Hills got the goals before Scott Taylor added a fine third to take Steve McMahon's team up to sixth place. Crewe stay above them on goal difference despite a 0-0 draw with Chesterfield. Mansfield, beaten 5-0 at Field Mill by Crewe last week, went one better this time, losing 4-0 to QPR. It was a fourth consecutive defeat and left them in the bottom three but Rangers, for whom Paul Furlong, Danny Shittu, Kevin Gallen and Andy Thomson got the goals, moved up to eighth. Rushden &amp; Diamonds took advantage of Hartlepool's 2-2 draw at Swansea to move to the top of the Third with a 3-0 home win over Southend. Hull City, the pre-season favourites, achieved their first win of the season, 2-1 at Cambridge United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
