This month, he went to watch the Rome Derby between Lazio and AS Roma on a student budget. What's special about it? Passion, drama, fevered chanting, politics ... the Derby della Capitale is the rowdiest in Italy. Staged in the belly of a giant modern coliseum, the hallowed Stadio Olimpico, this is true Roman theatre as the red and blue halves of the city do battle. One Derby even received the loftiest high-drama seal of approval of them all - Gazza's tears. When he scored the winner for Lazio in 1993, he was crying for most of the second half. The current Lazio idol is the former West Ham striker, Paolo Di Canio. Best place to stay Yellow Hostel (yellowhostel.com, \u00a315 per night) is billed as a perpetual party, but is a pretty tightly run ship, and does \"cool\" in a pub-crawl kind of way. For Bob Dylan cool, The Backpacker Hostel (0039 06 44 702506, \u00a315 per night) is a much more intimate, community-style set-up. Just the ticket While various online deals will charge a Pope's ransom for a package to the Roma v Lazio match, the unorthodox Rome ticketing system offers a bizarre alternative. As neither Roma nor Lazio actually own the Olimpico, a local betting firm has the right to sell as many as 20,000 tickets up until the day of the game. Look for the 60 or so Lottomatica offices all around the city, where tickets can be purchased for as little as \u00a320 provided you place a bet first. And be warned: due to recent anti-violence legislation, each ticket has to be personalised ... rendering any touted offerings useless. Cheapest thrill in town Handily, most derby matches are on a Sunday, when Rome buzzes. On the morning of the match, marinade yourself as follows: Catch the No 8 tram from Porta Maggiore to the Porta Portese street market in Trastevere, and be sure to have your camera at the ready as you go past the Coliseum on the way. Blogging it Laziofever.com is a fantastic forum for English-speaking Laziale, whose friendly posters often congregate in Rome for the match. Rock bottom fare Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Rome Ciampino from Stansted, Luton, Liverpool, East Midlands and Glasgow from \u00a335 return. Jet2 (jet2.com) is starting routes from Manchester in the New Year. How much for a weekend? \u00a3150 all in. Or less if you picked the winner in your \u00a320 pre-match bet. \u00b7 The next Lazio v Roma Derby is on Sunday February 26 2006."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
