The shocking allegations are contained in a submission by Charlotte Wilson, a former Save the Children case manager at the Nauru detention centre from January 2014 to February 2015. A Senate inquiry is investigating conditions and serious allegations at the Australian-run facility on the island. Wilson alleged that both Australian and Nauruan guards on the island \u2013 who work for the company Wilson Security, subcontracted by Transfield Services \u2013 \u201cfrequently abused their positions of power\u201d at the centre. She said it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d there was \u201cbartering and trading, including of sexual favours, within the camp\u201d. Some of the allegations about trading sexual favours for showers and drugs were substantiated in a report by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss. But in an allegation not previously disclosed in Moss\u2019s report, Wilson also said she had been told there were sex tapes which had been circulated of some of these sexual encounters. \u201cI was told that this was acknowledged in management meetings between service providers and that it was also established that these acts had been filmed and circulated around Wilson\u2019s staff,\u201d she said. \u201cI was also told that because prostitution is legal on Nauru that no action was being taken against the staff members involved. \u201cI firmly believe that the level of trauma that asylum seekers have been subjected to has caused profound damage to nearly every single man, woman and child who has been arbitrarily interned in Nauru.\u201d She also outlined concerns about the serious conflict of interest posed by Wilson Security in its role at the centre. She alleged that asylum seekers withheld information from these reports because they feared retribution. \u201cIt is my belief that information was withheld by asylum seekers who were fearful of retribution from security staff over any complaints,\u201d she said. \u201cAny incident report or information report that was submitted went through the Wilson chain of management to investigate.\u201d Another submission received from a current staff member on the island has detailed a series of alleged failures by the Nauruan police force (NPF) to investigate allegations of sexual assault. The current employee \u2013 who submitted anonymously because of feared retribution \u2013 outlined allegations of a recent incident where the Nauru police initially denied an Iranian woman had been sexually assaulted. \u201cShe was found naked and beaten around 9pm on the main road,\u201d the submission said. \u201cA government minister actually found her and took her to the police station. From there, she was taken to the RON hospital and examined. \u201cShe was returned to RPC1 [regional processing centre] by the police at 3am. The NPF did not take photos of the victim, nor was a rape kit utilised. \u201cThe female Wilson guard assigned to the victim had to be removed from duty as she could not stop crying. It was evident that the victim had been assaulted due to visible injuries. \u201cThe NPF denied the assault had taken place, despite the victim spending over five hours in their care.\u201d The submission said not a single sexual assault had been investigated by the police. It also alleged that video footage existed of a Nauruan \u201cengaging in a drug deal\u201d at the detention centre. The submission said that in another incident an intoxicated police officer \u201ctried to break down the front gate of the house of 14 unaccompanied refugee minors while yelling racial abuse at them\u201d. The minors did not lodge a complaint because they believed it would not be investigated adequately. The inquiry has received dozens of submissions from former staff at the centre. One submission from a former child protection worker, Viktoria Vibhakar, alleged cases of abuse of asylum seekers\u2019 children as young as two. Another submission from a former security guard claimed that the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young was the subject of sweeping surveillance to monitor her movements on the island."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
