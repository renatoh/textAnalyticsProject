Jack Kerouac said that fantasy writers were \"dead\" writers. They had nothing to say because for them life was dead, and by that measure language. I tried to read The Hobbit but I got to the point were I said \"I do not care what happens to these characters,\" and I stopped reading that style of fiction completely. My friends would play D&amp;D on weekends and I would sit on the couch playing my guitar while they were rolling for 'hit points'. Years later one of the young combatants told me how much he used to admire my playing. I'm glad he remembered me for that as a teenager, rather than for being an awesome \"Dungeon Master\". May the farce be with you. Matt Malin \u00b7 Genius. Especially the Rick Wakeman touch ... Lee Sullivan \u00b7 You sir, are a bitter old hack. The only reasonable explanation for your need to insult such a varied and diverse group as fans of JRR Tolkein is that you have a large cattle prod stuck up your ass and it's very uncomfortable. Lloyd, Toronto, Canada \u00b7 I am not a Lord of the Rings saddo, but yours was an interesting piece of journalism: \"Is it no coincidence that the release of fantasy films Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings comes as we are living under the threat of terrorist attack and being led into war by increasingly remote political leaders?\" Don't you think, given that the films were put into production last year with a release date of this Christmas decided at that time, that it probably IS a co-incidence? Just a thought... Jaime Gill \u00b7 You poor sad little man. I understand people not enjoying fantasy of Lord of the Rings ilk. We all have our own tastes. But to hate it for the reasons you espouse - because you believe those who enjoy a flight from reality are less likely to be able to come to grips with the complexity of the real world is utter rubbish. \"You won't find many fantasists working to make the real world a better place\" you claim. Absolute nonsense. I've found many people who read and enjoy science fiction and fantasy are persons of great depth, empathy, and imagination. These are exactly the people who make good liberal and progressive thinkers and doers. Something about the nastiness of your piece makes me think that your dislike of 'fanaticists' (an inaccurate and nasty choice of terms) must come from some undisclosed trauma. Eric Yablonowitz \u00b7 Well, here we go... the film is out in the theatres, so the spotlight is turned on the fans and their foibles and eccentricities, and the invective begins to flow. Anoraks, spots, emotionally disfunctional, no girlfriends, blah, blah, blah. Like we've never heard this nonsense, and countless variations like it before. Proof, if any were needed, that journalists are barely literate fuckwits who rely on reinforcing stereotypes rather than any kind of research into that of which they so glibly speak. I've heard tales of Tolkienites/D&amp;D players/computer gamers that seem to describe a whole different breed to the people I know as my friends. Ron Birrell \u00b7 How sour and sad to be obsessing about the qualities or lack thereof among the Hobbit-loving crowd. And what did Rick Wakeman ever do to you? Anyway it is probably the obsessed terrorist types and their government yahoo warriors who have spent too much time deciding who is good and who is evil and who to cast into the outer darkness. Bush and his 'evildoers' - dialogue right out of Middle Earth - or Narnia, or Hogwarts, or whatever. Sleep tight on Boxing Day. Carolyn Zaremba, San Francisco \u00b7 Lord of the Rings \"humourless\"? There's at least one good joke every 400 pages. No patience, that's your trouble. Hope your niece enjoys the movie. Richard Lough \u00b7 Someone has to be the contrarian and you're a funny one. I like real movies most of all but this is a great story and it should make a great film. Fantasy is an acquired taste, like beer. If you don't like beer, don't go to the beer tasting and you'll be happy. Greg Gibbs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
