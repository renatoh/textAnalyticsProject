It appears to have been anything but that. Furthermore, the inference is that investigations into other high-profile crimes may not have been handled as would have been expected. \"The ombudsman's criticisms have been vigorously rejected by the chief constable and many close observers believe there is a personal animus between the two individuals. There is certainly a clash of institutional strength and authority. And the way in which it is resolved will be enormously significant for the shaping and evolution of the police service of Northern Ireland.\" Mauric Hayes, who wrote the report that led to the setting up of the office of police ombudsman in the first place, argues in the republic's Irish Independent that Ms O'Loan has perhaps overstepped the mark. \"The primary purpose of the office of ombudsman is to protect its citizens from abuse of power by the police. It is intended to respond to complaints from those who have been abused in one way or another, although the ombudsman can, as in this case, act on her own initiative - a power which needs to be used sparingly and selectively. \"What the office is not about is the efficiency of police operations. This is a matter for the policing board and other agencies. While it may, at times, be a fine line between abuse of office on the one hand and inefficiency or misjudgment on the other, it is a line that must be held. It is a line too which the ombudsman may have crossed in this case. \"Much of the case too appears to turn on the handling of intelligence - always a difficult matter. The analysis of raw intelligence is a judgment call - which is not invalidated even if proved wrong with the benefit of hindsight.\" Chris Ryder, former member of the police authority for Northern Ireland, agrees in the Irish Times that it is easy to be wise after the event. \"Assessing intelligence is literally a life-and-death business in Northern Ireland. A wrong call and a terrible atrocity, like Omagh, can take place, or a highly-placed informer could be exposed and killed. In such circumstances, there is all too often a witch-hunt which appears to implicate the intelligence officers in the crime and obscure the evil and ruthlessness of the terrorists.\" Jude Collins, writing in the Irish News - read primarily by the Catholic community in the north - fears for Ulster's chances of creating a \"police service with which we can identify and trust\". \"While Ronnie said last July that talk of warnings were irresponsible and without foundation,\" she writes, \"he now concedes there was a warning 11 days before the bomb, but it was of a gun and mortar attack. A totally different thing, he says. \"True enough. Although, if you or I were told people were coming to attack us with guns and mortars, would we keep a sharp look-out for attacks of any kind? I think so. And if eight days later we got a second warning, that a bomb was on the way, would we be even more vigilant? You bet. And if afterwards someone asked us: 'Did you receive any warning about this attack?' and we wanted to be truthful we'd have to say yes, wouldn't we?\" She concludes: \"Ronnie's first passion is rugby; his second, we're told, is the poetry of W B Yeats. He'll be familiar, then, with the first line of The Lake Isle of Inisfree. It begins: 'I will arise and go now.' Don't just read it, Ronnie. Do it.\" An editorial in the Irish Examiner praises Ms O'Loans \"commendable objectivity and impartiality in the teeth of what can only be described as a blatant campaign of intimidation\", and draws a parallel between the murder of nationalist lawyer Pat Finucane, which \"has also prompted allegations of a cover-up and of police collusion\". William Stobie, who was acquitted of Finucane's murder last month through lack of evidence, was yesterday shot dead in a Belfast street. \"In the wake of his acquittal,\" explains the Examiner, \"Stobie had become a marked man because of his call for further inquiries to be conducted into Pat Finnucane's murder ... Clearly, an independent inquiry is warranted. There is an urgent need for a full review of the lines of communication between the special branch and the police in the north. Nothing less than full inquiries into the Omagh bomb and the murder of Pat Finucane will restore credibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
