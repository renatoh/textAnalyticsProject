Malaria cases have risen by 31% in the Dominican Republic this year, but what is unusual is that these cases have occurred in typical holiday destinations rather than rural areas. \"What's worrying is that people don't think of the Caribbean as a malarial area,\" said Peter Chiodini, director of the Health Protection Agency's Malaria Reference Laboratory. The cases arose between October and December this year, and all 14 of the infected tourists had visited the resorts of Bavaro or Punta Cana, where a number of major hotels are sited. Both resorts are in the eastern province of La Altagracia, and the Foreign Office has amended its travel advice for the whole region. Other malarial areas of the Caribbean include Costa Rica, El Salvador, Haiti and parts of Mexico. The tourists - six Germans, four Canadians, two Ameri cans, one Spaniard and one Briton - were infected with the P falciparum strain, which is the cause of most malaria deaths. Professor Chiodini said: \"The British person [who cannot be named for reasons of patient confidentiality] was at a resort near Punta Cana. It was a normal holiday and a normal holidaymaker.\" A spokesperson for the Dominican Republic Tourist Board said: \"Out of an average 2 million visitors per year, this represents a fairly low risk.\" She also outlined a number of steps the government has taken, including increased fumigation and doctors placed temporarily in major hotels to test tourists reporting fever, the commonest early symptom of malaria. According to research published this week by the Malaria Awareness Campaign, 2,000 Britons a year return from holiday with malaria. Last year, there were 16 deaths, a 78% increase on 2002. Of the UK tourists polled, 43% said they were unaware they needed to take anti-malaria precautions.
