The director's staging for Essen's Aalto-Musiktheater isn't quite the brutal affair this observation might suggest, though it's a sparse, psychologically penetrating piece of music theatre that generates considerable tension. Neither Lehnhoff nor conductor Stefan Soltesz subscribe to the oft-voiced view that the work itself is muted or restrained. There's a palpable erotic charge between Jacques Imbrailo's handsome Pell\u00e9as and Michaela Selinger's full-on M\u00e9lisande. Vincent Le Texier's Golaud is pathological if empathetic, while Soltesz's conducting is opulently post-Wagnerian rather than reined-in. The costumes, awkwardly, aim to suggest timelessness by simultaneously evoking different historical periods. The use of narrative titles in the interludes is a big mistake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
