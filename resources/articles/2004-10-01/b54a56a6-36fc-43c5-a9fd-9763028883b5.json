These soon manifested themselves in the works of art that make up the Victoria and Albert Museum's new exhibition, The Meeting of Asia and Europe. This preview of the exhibition shows the enduring legacy of the fabrics and materials used to make some exquisite creations. Horizon 9pm, BBC2 It's always fascinating to see the scientific community get its knickers in a twist when someone comes along to turn over a dearly held theory. This time it's Professor Gerta Keller who is making herself unpopular by questioning the long-held view that dinosaurs were wiped out by the impact of an asteroid 65 million years ago. Not quite, she says, pointing to some rock formations in Mexico that show that the impact theory isn't as cut and dried as once thought. But then two other scientists have worked out another theory, just to thicken the plot somewhat. The Great British Asian Invasion 9pm, Channel 4 Many people in Britain tend to lump all Asians into one homogeneous group, not knowing or caring about the differing cultures and continents that make up Britain's largest immigrant minority. As this entertaining and engrossing documentary shows, we've got the doctors from India who were invited to shore up the faltering NHS in the 1960s (organised by Enoch Powell, no less). Then there are the Bangladeshis who transformed British cuisine with their countless \"Indian\" restaurants, and the East African Asians who were suddenly turfed out of Uganda and came to Britain to resume their centuries-old tradition of trade and transformed business practices. And then there are Pakistanis who took up offers of back-breaking, exploitative work in northern factories to keep British industry going."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
