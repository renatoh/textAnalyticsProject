It\u2019s not only that its occasionally macabre plots are so satisfyingly intricate, nor its settings so vivid. The really big draw is the marvellous and utterly convincing Maggy Garrisson herself, a sardonic tyro private detective whose reserves of initiative and pluck run deeper even than her many flaws (these include drinking, smoking, thieving and sleeping with the wrong blokes). Part Philip Marlowe and part Bridget Jones, it\u2019s slightly surprising that this whip-smart but frequently worn-down young woman from Nottinghamshire could be the creation of two Frenchmen \u2013 but she is, and for this, they deserve all the prizes. Maggy lives in a tiny flat in a shabby corner of north-west London, the city being the story\u2019s second most important character: Oiry draws every location from Kensal Rise to Tottenham Court Road to the interior of Maggy\u2019s favourite pub in such a way that your eye stays with each detail-perfect frame long after you\u2019ve read Trondheim\u2019s pithy dialogue. When the book opens, she has been on the dole for two years, but her luck is about to change. A neighbour has recommended her to Anthony Wight, an ageing private eye whose latest case she will shortly \u201csolve\u201d (rather than finding out what happened to the canary belonging to the old lady upstairs, his new assistant, starting as she means to go on, simply heads out to the nearest pet shop and buys a substitute). Wight, a drinker with shady associates, is good for nothing, but her association with him will nevertheless change Maggy\u2019s life for the better. Henceforth, our heroine will inhabit a world occupied by bent coppers and career criminals \u2013 and to be honest, she will find that she quite likes it. Anything, after all, is better than being broke \u2013 her first big case proves surprisingly lucrative \u2013 and one of the thugs sent round by a Mr Big to frighten her is so madly attractive, she hardly minds. Maggy\u2019s conscience troubles her only rarely, nor is she exactly what you might call squeamish (later, for complicated reasons, she will gatecrash a funeral where she will attempt to insert a gold tooth in the mouth of the deceased as he lies in an open casket). Life, for her, is about survival, and if this means taking advantage of an old lady or hiding a gun in the crisper box of her fridge, so be it. It has still got to be an improvement on another miserable visit to Sainsbury\u2019s, where the limit of her aspirations is the purchase of cheap biscuits. But who cares, really, about her morals? I like Maggy\u2019s self-sufficiency and lack of self-pity almost as much as I like her frank and distinctly lecherous ways with the opposite sex. She may not be able to solve every mystery, least of all the puzzle that is herself. But this unlikely gumshoe of the peeling Victorian terrace, the rattling tube train and the local boozer will always have a go, and sod any trouble it\u2019s likely to bring her. \u2022 Maggy Garrisson by Lewis Trondheim and St\u00e9phane Oiry is published by SelfMadeHero (\u00a314.99).
