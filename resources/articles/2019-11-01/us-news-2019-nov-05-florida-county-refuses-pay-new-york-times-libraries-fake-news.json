At a meeting in Citrus county, a coastal area west of Orlando, several of the city\u2019s five commissioners laughed as they explained why they did not want to approve the library\u2019s request. \u201cFake news, I agree with President Trump,\u201d commissioner Scott Carnahan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the New York Times in this county. I don\u2019t agree with it, I don\u2019t like \u2019em, it\u2019s fake news and I\u2019m voting no. They can take that money and do something else with it \u2026 I support Donald Trump.\u201d The library requested $2,700 to pay for digital access to the New York Times for the 70,000 library-card holders in Citrus county. The library already pays for a print edition of the New York Times, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In the late October meeting, the commissioners didn\u2019t deliberate the merits of the library\u2019s request and instead shrugged it off. \u201cWhy the heck would we spend money on something like that?\u201d asked one commissioner. The decision caused a stir in the county, with residents complaining, and sometimes praising, the decision in comments to the county and local newspaper. The feedback prompted one commissioner, Brian Coleman, to say he would reconsider the topic in the near future. \u201cDo I think I made a mistake? Yes,\u201d Coleman told the Citrus County Chronicle. \u201cOur decision should have been impartial, instead of having it become a personal thing.\u201d The four other commissioners stood by their decision. The 24 October meeting occurred the same day the White House said it was planning to order federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post because the newspapers have published stories that reflect poorly on the president. Among these stories were Pulitzer prize-winning investigations including the New York Times story which revealed Trump is not a self-made millionaire because his father provided him with at least $413m and the Washington Post\u2019s discovery of the \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d video and its revelations that Trump has for decades overstated his charitable giving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
