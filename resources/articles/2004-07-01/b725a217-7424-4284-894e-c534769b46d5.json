Black polo neck, bangles, death-mask make-up: he seemed the perfect man for me. I even believed him when he said he had a girlfriend (yes, that unawakened). But over two decades our relationship has weathered many changes. Not least Almond's transition from pop icon to subversive cabaret artist. It's been five years since he played the Almeida theatre (a great venue for his spikily intimate set), and guess what: this time he's happy. Or, to quote Almond: 'Notice that I haven't insulted or attacked you this evening. I'm better behaved now. I've gone through my cynical and bitter phase.' In fact the show is unashamedly romantic. The first half features tracks from his latest album, Heart on Snow (19th-century Russian romance songs recorded in St Petersburg). In his new role as the adopted son of Mother Russia, Almond performs alone on stage against grainy Soviet-era footage of beautiful sailor boys and dissidents. It's heartfelt, epic stuff - especially his vodka-tinged delivery of 'Always and Everywhere (I Will Follow You)' by the gay artist Vadim Kozin, who was sent to prison in 1945 for refusing to sing for Stalin. It could all get a bit worthy. But the second act of the show is where Marc gets down and dirty. The bare brick walls of the Almeida are washed in coloured light, as he croons through a set of Jacques Brel, Cole Porter, Nina Simone, and Lou Reed, accompanied by his musicians. It's cabaret for grown-ups. But there are dangerous moments. A rare 1970s Canadian track ('Hustler's Tango') about rape succeeds simply because it is a gay man singing it. While a terrifyingly weary version of Reed's 'Caroline Says' is soaked in sexual obsession. And Almond looks fantastic for 47. He is of course irredeemably vain (don't miss his latest volume of autobiography, In Search of The Pleasure Palace, for the gory details of his recent nose job) but he knows he's still the boy from Stockport, desperate to shake off his provincial roots. Playing to a rapturous audience, he could get away with murder. But even his own songs get a bracing reworking here - from 'Tenderness Is a Weakness' to 'When Bad People Kiss'. While the magnificently operatic 'What Makes A Man A Man?' could be the plot of an Almod\u00f3var film. 'Beauty, tragedy, doomed youth, tragedy, beauty, that's all I write about. I must get some new songs,' teases Almond. But then brilliantly he kicks off his heels and launches into a set of blues and soul covers ('Catch a Falling Star', 'Strangers in the Night'). Only Almond would dare to champion the likes of Johnny Mathis and Mel Torm\u00e9 as great torch singers, and yet it pays off. Even his voice sounds different: strong, velvety... and yes, oddly straight. Strutting around the stage in his Dior Homme suit and white shirt, serenading women in the audience, Almond could be the new gay Tom Jones. I can offer no higher compliment. \u00b7 Final performance tonight. 7.30 Three to see Tanya Donnelly Updated southern sounds from the ex-Throwing Muses singer. Bush Hall, London W12 (Tue and Wed).
