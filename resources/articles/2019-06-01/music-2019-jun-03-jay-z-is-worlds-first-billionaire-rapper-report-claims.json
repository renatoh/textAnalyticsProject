The magazine has claimed the 49-year-old\u2019s empire \u201cconservatively\u201d totals $1bn after valuing his various ventures as well as any real estate and his art collection. Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, is one of just a handful of billionaire entertainers and the first hip-hop artist to claim such a fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than hip-hop,\u201d said his longtime collaborator Kasseem \u201cSwizz Beatz\u201d Dean. \u201cIt\u2019s the blueprint for our culture. A guy that looks like us, sounds like us, loves us, made it to something that we always felt that was above us.\u201d Some of his most valuable holdings include his $310m ownership of Armand de Brignac champagne, a $100m stake in D\u2019Uss\u00e9 cognac, his $100m Tidal streaming service, $50m in real estate and a $70m investment in Uber. It\u2019s also estimated that his music catalogue is worth about $75m thanks to a careful negotiation of his publishing rights. \u201cMost times rappers end up broke or nowhere,\u201d he said in a 2005 interview when his estimated worth was $350m. \u201cIt\u2019s time for someone to take it to the next level, to become an executive and open the doors for the culture.\u201d Jay-Z grew up in a housing project in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, and was selling drugs as a teen before he started rapping. Without a label, he started selling CDs out of his car before releasing his first album, 1996\u2019s Reasonable Doubt which has sold more than 1.5m copies since. In 2008, he married Beyonc\u00e9, whose net worth is estimated to be $355m. On his last album, 2017\u2019s 4:44, he rapped: \u201cAin\u2019t no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I\u2019m cute.\u201d Recently, the rapper has been involved in philanthropic endeavours, offering legal assistance to cases involving black men mistreated by the criminal justice system. \u201cIf he\u2019s a billionaire now, imagine what he\u2019s about to be,\u201d Swizz Beatz also said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s only just starting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
