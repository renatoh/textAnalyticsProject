Susan Levy, 53, of Newgate Street Village, Cuffley, Hertfordshire, died in the tube train explosion near King's Cross on Thursday and was the first among the dead to be formally identified. Several hours later, University College London announced that one of its employees, Gladys Wundowa, a cleaner, charity worker and student, died in the attacks. Mrs Wundowa, of Chadwell Heath, Essex, was married to Emmanuel, a security guard, and thought to be going to a college course in Shoreditch, east London, after her early morning's work in the UCL department of civil and environmental engineering. As the victims were named, the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, opened a condolence book in City Hall. \"The city will endure. It's the future of our world. Tolerance and change,\" Mr Livingstone wrote in the book. In a statement, Mrs Levy's husband, Harry, a London taxi driver, said: \"Susan was a devoted and much-loved wife and mother of two sons. We are all devastated by our loss. \"She was a valued and respected member of her extended Jewish family and will be deeply mourned and sadly missed by us and her many friends.\" Mrs Levy left for work in central London on Thursday with her son, Jamie, and the two parted at Finsbury Park. She continued her journey on the tube train that was bombed as it left King's Cross. \"We are all distraught at her needless loss and our thoughts and prayers are also with the many other families affected by this horrendous tragedy,\" Mr Levy's statement said. An inquest into his wife's death opened at St Pancras coroner's court, in London, at 10am and adjourned immediately. No family members were present. Fifty-two people died and 700 people were injured in four explosions on Thursday. Three of the blasts happened on the underground network and the other on a bus in Tavistock Square. Over the last two days, around12 families have been visited at their homes to be told that, although formal identification has not been completed, it is clear that their relative has been killed. Police believe all the bodies have been recovered from the Piccadilly line tube train under King's Cross, but said the confirmed number of dead could rise to 60. Temperatures of 60C (140F), asbestos and the danger that the tunnel might collapse hampered the recovery effort. Sixty-two people injured in the attack were still being treated in London hospitals today. Paddington rail crash survivor Pam Warren has offered to meet and comfort the London bombing victim Davinia Turrell, who has become known as the \"girl in the mask\". Mrs Warren suffered terrible hand and facial burns in the October 1999 Paddington disaster and had to wear a face mask for 15 months. Miss Turrell, 24, a barrister, was photographed clutching a surgical burns mask to her face as she stumbled from the scene of last Thursday's attack at Edgware Road Tube station. \"My heart goes out to all those recovering from their injuries. I know what Davinia and the others are going through. I would not want anyone to go through all that,\" Mrs Warren said. Outside King's Cross, the friends and families of missing people left posters asking whether anyone had seen their loved ones. Speaking in Tavistock Square, where 13 bus passengers were killed, Marie Fatayi-Williams, mother of Anthony Fatayi-Williams, 26, said she had not heard from her son since Thursday. Mobile phone records show Mr Fatayi-Williams contacted his employer, oil group Amec, at 9.41am but it is feared he took the No 30 bus to work after stopping to help tube passengers caught up in the confusion. The bus bomb exploded at 9.47am. Mrs Fatayi-Williams, who flew in from Nigeria in the hope of finding her son, held back tears as she made the address. \"How many tears shall we cry? How many mothers' hearts shall be maimed? My heart is maimed at this moment. I pray I will see my son Anthony.\" Friends told how a companion had travelled with him from Hendon as far as Camden Town, where he headed to the City branch of the Northern line to catch a train to Old Street. The family believe that witnesses later saw Mr Fatayi-Williams in Euston, helping passengers find buses in the confusion after the tube train bomb attacks. The diocese of Bristol announced that that the 24-year-old daughter of one of its vicars was feared to be among the victims. Jenny Nicholson went missing on Thursday. Her parents, the Rev Julie Nicholson and her husband Gregg, feared the worst and rushed to London from their holiday in Anglesey, north Wales. Ms Nicholson lived in Reading and commuted to the capital daily. \"They weren't able to contact her and travelled to London to look for her,\" the diocese said in a statement. \"We know there are still bodies that haven't been recovered and that the police are being very careful about identifying bodies. There's not a lot they can do now, apart from wait.\" \u00b7 Guardian Unlimited has a collection of photographs and information on those reported dead in the attacks and some of those still missing.
