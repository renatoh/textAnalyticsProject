The massive defense spending bill Trump signed last month created the Space Force, a new branch of the military for which he has been pushing since early 2018. Almost immediately after the design\u2019s unveiling, people began pointing out the many similarities it bore to the logo for a certain fictional space fleet. George Takei, one of the stars of Star Trek, jumped into the conversation to suggest the Trump administration pay the cast \u201croyalties\u201d. Takei also took a dig at the first lady, who appeared to plagiarize lines directly from a Michelle Obama speech for her own address as the 2016 Republican National convention. Space Force, the first new military service since the creation of the Air Force in 1947, is part of Trump\u2019s efforts to shore up American dominance in space. \u201cSpace is the world\u2019s new war-fighting domain,\u201d Trump said during a signing ceremony in December, at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington. \u201cAmong grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital. And we\u2019re leading, but we\u2019re not leading by enough, and very shortly we\u2019ll be leading by a lot.\u201d Amid the hullabaloo, some pointed out that the United States has been all about that \u201clive long and prosper\u201d life for a while now. And the central feature of the logo wasn\u2019t the only part of the design that looked \u2026 familiar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
