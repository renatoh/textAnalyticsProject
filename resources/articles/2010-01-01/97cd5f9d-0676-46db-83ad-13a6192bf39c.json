The French club fear the Premier League strugglers are unable to pay the prearranged price to make the transfer definitive and have begun sounding out other clubs about a move. Lens say Portsmouth promised to pay them \u00a34m and take Dindane on a full contract after the striker's 11th appearance for them. The terms of the agreement were renegotiated to give Portsmouth some breathing space on the eve of Dindane's 11th match \u2013 the 2-0 Premier League win over Burnley \u2013 but, with the south coast club seemingly no closer to finding the fee, Lens have explored a contingency plan. They could demand Dindane's return this month so that they might sell him to a club with the funds to pay them. Dindane, who has now played 14 times for Portsmouth, scoring five goals, is surplus to requirement at Lens. He is currently on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Ivory Coast and Fifa rules would permit him to join another club during this transfer window. Players can be registered at three clubs during the course of a season but they can play official games for only two of them. Dindane did not appear for Lens at the start of the season. The Lens president, Gervais Martel, is frustrated at Portsmouth who, he says, still owe his club the final instalments on Nadir Belhadj's transfer. The Algeria defender, who is also away at the Africa Cup of Nations, completed a \u00a34.4m move from Lens to Fratton Park last January, after an initial loan spell. The Premier League, however, is poised to divert \u00a37m, which is Portsmouth's next tranche of television money, directly to the club's creditors, who are awaiting instalments on transfer fees. Portsmouth owe a total of \u00a310m and their creditors include Chelsea over Glen Johnson; Tottenham (Younes Kaboul); Udinese (Sulley Muntari) and Rennes (John Utaka) not to mention Lens (Belhadj and Dindane). The league must decide how best to divide the \u00a37m, with Lens fearing that it will prioritise the English creditors. The deadline for Portsmouth to make sizeable inroads into these debts and to persuade the league not to keep hold of the \u00a37m is tomorrow. Portsmouth also face losing the midfielder Jamie O'Hara back to Tottenham Hotspur on Friday when his loan spell expires. The transfer embargo that has been placed on Portsmouth by the Premier League for their non-payment of fees to other clubs precludes them from reregistering O'Hara and there appears to be little prospect of the embargo being lifted. The situation is unfortunate for O'Hara who, having appeared for Tottenham at the beginning of the season, would, unless an extraordinary exception is made, be prevented from moving from White Hart Lane this month to play for another club. He wants to stay at Portsmouth and they want to keep him while Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, is happy, too, for him to remain at Fratton Park. Back at Tottenham, O'Hara's opportunities would be restricted. The Portsmouth manager, Avram Grant, is also considering whether to recall the striker David Nugent from Burnley when his loan spells ends on Friday week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
