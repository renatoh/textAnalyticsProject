Peace Sandberg, 40, a housing support worker, was called \"manipulative and a stranger to the truth\" by the judge at Isleworth crown court, west London. After buying the child Sandberg used a forged birth certificate to get a visa for him from the British high commission in Nigeria, her native country. Within hours of landing at Heathrow airport Sandberg, a support worker at Kensington Housing Trust who had been living in a hostel, was at Ealing council's homeless persons unit, cradling the child in her arms. She claimed she had returned to Africa in December 2006 to give birth and needed a flat for herself and her \"son\". But the court heard she was immediately recognised by Lizette Reddy, a housing officer. Reddy remembered Sandberg, who has joint Nigerian and Swedish nationality, as not being pregnant when she saw her two months earlier. Sandberg denied any wrongdoing, claiming she had adopted her cousin's orphaned son to give him a better life in Britain. She also said she took the \u00a3150 to Nigeria simply to help care for him while she was out there. But a jury took 40 minutes to unanimously convict her of one count of child trafficking. Sandberg remained impassive as Judge Sam Kathkuda told her it was clear she had lied repeatedly during the \"pre-planned and pre-meditated\" operation to breach immigration laws. But later she burst into tears, insisting: \"I am not a liar. I have never told a lie in my life ... I have done nothing wrong.\" Outside court, Detective Inspector Gordon Valentine of the joint police and immigration service Paladin team, which investigates child trafficking and exploitation, welcomed the sentence. \"This is the first case I am aware of where a child has been smuggled into Britain to get a free home,\" he said. The child has since been taken into care. Sandberg's five-day trial heard that in May 2006, she had been renting a private property in Acton, west London, when rent arrears and disputes with neighbours forced her to leave. She contacted the local council for help only for them to decide she had made herself intentionally homeless. But officials said they could provide temporary accommodation because she had a 12-year-old daughter. Some time later police and social services learned the girl had returned to her father in Sweden and told Sandberg she faced eviction. Shortly afterwards the defendant bought return tickets to Nigeria for herself and the child, returning weeks later with the boy. Chris Beddoe of Ecpat UK, a pressure group which campaigns for tougher laws against child traffickers, said: \"We are seeing increasing evidence that children are being trafficked into Britain for benefit fraud.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
