It was the first time that Pyongyang had showed its weapons could in theory reach American soil. But that alarming milestone appears already to have been overtaken with the launch on Friday of a new missile which experts believe is capable of striking Los Angeles, Chicago and potentially even New York. The development raises the stakes even higher in an already tense standoff between the rogue state and the US and its regional allies. \u201cIt now appears that a significant portion of the continental United States is within range\u201d of North Korean missiles, Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst for the CIA who is currently at the Heritage Foundation, told the Associated Press. The ICBM tested on Friday remained airborne for 47 minutes \u2013 over five minutes longer than the 4 July test \u2013 and, according to South Korean military reached an estimated height of 3,700km (2,300 miles), compared with around 2,500km (1,550 miles) at the last test. David Wright, a physicist and co-director at the Union of Concerned Scientists Global Security Program told the AP Friday\u2019s test indicated a range of around 10,400 km (6,500 miles) \u2013 well within reach of major cities throughout the US and only around 600km short of Washington DC. The timing and location of Friday\u2019s launch \u2013 late into the evening in the remote province of Chagang \u2013 was also a cause for concern said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at Middlebury Institute of International Studies. \u201cUsually they [North Korea] have done these nice, easily visible tasks where we could see them coming,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere was a report about the last one in July about 70 minutes before the missile went up, which would obviously allow you to attack it. It seems like they did this one, in a more covert manner to demonstrate that we can\u2019t find them in advance.\u201d Lewis said he believed the missile tested on Friday was the same model as the one tested earlier in the month, but had been primed to travel a greater distance. At the moment, however, there is no photographic record of the launch. While the apparently rapid advance in North Korea\u2019s missile programme will add to concerns that the regime is moving closer to developing the capacity to strike major cities in the US mainland, many analysts still doubt whether it can miniaturise a nuclear weapon sufficiently to fit it on to a missile. They also believe the regime is unlikely to have mastered the technology needed for an ICBM to survive re-entry into the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Earlier this week, however, American intelligence analysts revised their prediction over when Kim Jong-un would develop a reliable ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, stating the North Korean dictator could now have such a weapon ready by 2018. \u201cKim Jong-un does seem hellbent on acquiring the capability to reach the United States with nuclear weapons,\u201d said Sharon Squassoni, director of the Proliferation Prevention Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) told the Washington Post. Donald Trump, who has vowed not to allow North Korea build a viable nuclear ready ICBM, has employed a scattergun approach to diplomacy with Kim. In May he said he would be \u201chonoured\u201d to meet the dictator and share hamburgers over a conference table. In July, following the first ICBM launch, Trump mocked him on Twitter asking: \u201cDoes this guy have anything better to do with his life?\u201d As the stakes continue to increase, such incoherence is becoming increasingly unviable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
