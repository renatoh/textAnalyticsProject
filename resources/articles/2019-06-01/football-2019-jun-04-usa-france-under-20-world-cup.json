Sebastian Soto tied the score with his second goal of the match in the 74th minute and New England Revolution product Justin Rennicks scored the go-ahead goal off a rebound in the 83rd minute to set up a quarter-final clash with Ecuador on Saturday. Soto put the US ahead in the 25th minute, sprinting past defender Enzo Loiodice to take a through pass from Richard Ledezma, who dribbled half the length of the field on a counter-attack. France took a 2-1 lead on goals by Amine Gouri in the 41st and Nabil Alioui in the 55th. Soto scored his fourth goal of the tournament, slipping past Dan Zagadou to run onto a pass from Tim Weah, taking two touches and beating goalkeeper Alban Lafont with a left-footed shot. Rennicks entered in the 63rd minute and got the winner when Sergino Dest\u2019s 25-yard shot was parried by a diving Lafont, and Rennicks beat the goalkeeper to the rebound and poked the ball in. American midfielders Alex Mendez and Chris Durkin were suspended for the round of 16 match because of yellow-card accumulation but will be eligible to return for the quarter-finals. In quarter-finals on Friday, Italy face Mali and Colombia meet Ukraine. The winner of Saturday\u2019s match between USA and Ecuador advance to a semifinal against South Korea or Senegal. The Americans were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Serbia on penalty kicks in 2015 and by Venezuela in extra time two years ago. The US made their only semifinal appearance in 1989."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
