Imran Farooq was a co-founder of the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) party. He was killed in broad daylight by at least one attacker who stabbed and beat him to death. Detectives are hunting his attacker or attackers and interviewing witnesses. They are also trying to secure any CCTV footage from the part of north London where Farooq lived. He had come to Britain claiming he faced persecution. Diplomatic sources told the Guardian there was shock about the killing, with one saying it was obvious he was killed by an enemy, but it remained to be seen whether the motive was personal, to do with rivalry within his party, or by people motivated by hatred of the MQM. In recent weeks the MQM leader, Altaf Hussain, called for a revolution in Pakistan as he tried to exploit anger over the extensive flooding in the country. There have been accusations that the ruling elites had botched the response. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: \"Police were called to Green Lane, Edgware shortly before 1730hrs on Thursday 16 September following reports of a serious assault. \"On arrival, officers found an Asian man, aged 50, with stab wounds and head injuries. Paramedics treated the man, but he was pronounced dead at the scene at approximately 1837hrs. \"Next of kin have been informed. We await formal identification. A postmortem examination will be scheduled in due course. The homicide and serious crime command are investigating.\" The MQM said Farooq had been living in exile in London since 1992. According to reports on the MQM website from 1999, he sought political asylum in the UK after a bounty was put on his head. Farooq said he was implicated on a range of charges including criminal and terrorist activities but insisted the allegations were politically motivated. He claimed in November 1992 that he was wanted \"dead or alive\". \"[This gave] licence and impunity to every individual in Pakistan to assassinate me,\" he said. Farooq, who was secretary general of the MQM, said he spent more than seven years in hiding in Karachi, southern Pakistan. \"It was impossible for me to remain in Pakistan due to the continued threat on my life and liberty.\" The MQM is the fourth largest political party in Pakistan, and the dominant party in Karachi. It was founded in 1984 by Hussain, a former Chicago cab driver, and won broad support among the \"mohajirs\" - Muslims who fled India after partition in 1947. The party prided itself on its well-oiled machine and its secular, liberal outlook. But British police sources have said it was also linked to extortion, gun smuggling and South African crime networks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
