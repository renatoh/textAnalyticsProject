Before then, the hipster Palm Springs of the 1940s and 1950s had long given way to a couple of divergent tourist scenes. Your choice was the 'God's waiting room' set, the retirees drawn by the perma-sun and endless golf courses, or alternatively, you could opt for the $49 (\u00a335) a night 'gay only, clothes optional' weekend hideaways. Looking for a new business - and reason to escape London - venture capitalist Robertson and artist Robarts wandered across the southern United States in search of the right opening. 'The thing that struck you about Palm Springs was the fantastic, mid-century architecture, and how much of it was disused,' Robarts recalls. Just as modernism had given Miami a lift, the couple believed that Palm Springs could reinvent itself, in part, by renovating its handsome architectural stock. The place Robertson and Robarts hit upon had enjoyed a glamorous past as The Mira Loma, a haunt for the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Veronica Lake and Gloria Swanson. The couple's aim was to bring back the swing, with all appropriate touches. They found period furniture, from designers such as Charles Eames, and kitted out rooms with chenille bedspreads, red shagpile carpets... you get the idea. The effect is best experienced poolside, with its blue AstroTurf sun-deck, marshmallow sofas, and Dean Martin on the sound system. Throw in the view of the San Jacinto mountains, which overlook Palm Springs, and you can see that Robertson and Robarts are on to something. Just after six in the evening, guests gather at the poolside bar for a cocktail sharpener. Around the pool the weekend I stayed were a fashion crowd, and 'a personal trainer to the stars' who had just driven in from Los Angeles, two hours away. Other places have now followed the Ballantines lead, with small, kitschy hotels opening over town. The gamble paid off so well for Robertson and Robarts that they have opened a second hotel, the Ballantines Movie Colony, just up the road from the original. This one has the added bonus of being designed by Albert Frey, who was the residential architectural star of Palm Springs in its heyday. In town, architectural conferences are now all the rage. 'It's great,' says one visitor. 'You can pretend you're coming to check out the buildings' fine lines. Really, you're here to get smashed.' \u00b7 www.ballantineshotels.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
