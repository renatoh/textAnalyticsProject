The Everton centre-half, who was overlooked for the World Cup this summer having returned from a long-term knee injury in the new year, started last month's friendly against Hungary initially alongside Terry, and was technically the senior centre-back in the qualifying victory over Bulgaria on Friday. England travel to Switzerland today with only three fit centre-halves, and Jagielka's position in the starting line-up is assured. That represents something of a rapid rise for the 28-year-old, who now boasts five caps and is confident he could yet become a regular in the side even when Terry and Ferdinand recover from hamstring and knee injuries respectively. \"It's always hard to displace players like JT and Rio,\" he said. \"But I would like to think I can. If Rio and JT come back fit for the next squad and are in form and get picked, they are not bad players to be behind. \"But I'd like to put real pressure on them, that's what it's all about, and I'm sure the manager wants that as well. He's always said he wants to pick from players who are in form, so if I can keep playing international football and keep keeping clean sheets then, hopefully, it cranks up the pressure a bit.\" Jagielka had been suffering through last week with a badly bruised foot which required treatment three times a day and granted him only one opportunity to train, on the eve of the Wembley match. Yet his pace was still noticeable against Bulgaria and will be needed again in Basle, where he will be partnered either by the experienced Matthew Upson or Gary Cahill, who replaced the injured Michael Dawson on Friday to make his international debut. Fabio Capello has opted against calling up a fourth centre-half, and will retain the Under-21s' Scott Loach as third-choice goalkeeper with Scott Carson granted leave after a family bereavement. Joe Hart will continue as first choice after another fine display frustrated the Bulgarians, though the England manager admitted the 23-year-old had needed the reality check provided by the past two years to further his development. \"He is good, he is young, he can improve,\" said Capello. \"He has to work. I remember when I selected him two years ago [for a friendly in Trinidad] he was not the same player. He did not have the same focus on the games or the training. He probably started to play in the first XI too early and started to think: 'I am the best.' You have to understand what happens in the mind of the young player, and sometimes this can happen. \"But in two years he has come back. He has improved a lot because of the one season he played in the Premier League last year at Birmingham. It was very important. He played every game. It was really important for him, and he improved a lot in that time.\" Hart, like Jagielka, will expect to be tested more rigorously in Basle against a Swiss side who beat the eventual world champions Spain in their opening group game in South Africa. Their campaign petered out thereafter, but Ottmar Hitzfeld's side arguably represent England's sternest challenge in Group G. \"It's massively important that we kick on from the Bulgaria game now,\" said Jagielka. \"The build-up to the Hungary and Bulgaria games was a little bit negative, but we had a bad World Cup. There's nothing we can do about that, it's gone, but the win on Friday did take some pressure off. Now we have to go to Switzerland with the same mentality \u2013 we want to go and win that and qualify in style again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
