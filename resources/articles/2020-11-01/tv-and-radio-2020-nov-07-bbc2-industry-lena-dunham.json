You get others, obviously \u2013 \u201cmaverick cop is convinced this small-town murder isn\u2019t as solved as the sheriff thinks it is\u201d; \u201cuptight dad dips into the murky criminal underworld, loses himself in the process\u201d; \u201cfour couples who all own beach houses separately find themselves having an affair\u201d \u2013 but those are the big two. If only there were some way to combine them \u2026 Anyway, this week sees the launch of Industry (Tuesday, 9.15pm, BBC Two), a TV drama about rich people with high-pressure jobs and complicated private lives who are also good-looking young people being chaotically horny; it\u2019s the Billions x Skins mashup event we never knew we needed. The rough pencil sketch is this: five fresh-faced, legacy college graduates all start at a renowned financial firm on the same day but panic about it in different directions. You have Harper (Myha\u2019la Herrold, who is fantastic), the assured American with a murky secret; Robert (Harry Lawtey, fantastic), the shagger lad who came to the industry a decade too late; Hari (Nabhaan Rizwan, fantastic), the state-school boy with a point to prove; Yasmin (Marisa Abela, fantastic), the multilingual rich girl who keeps getting stuck on the coffee run; and Gus (David Jonsson, don\u2019t make me say it), who pulsates with Eton confidence but still gets tripped up on the jagged edges of the real world. Together they all shout things I don\u2019t fully understand into phones then go back to each other\u2019s houses and have vile, sweaty seshes then go back to work, then, after that, somehow, go out and have a pint. It crackles with energy. In the wrong hands, this would just be a dramatised version of The Apprentice (Michael Sheen, after 16 hours of makeup to make him look like a dried apricot, lifting one stiff arm up and purring: \u201cYer fired\u201d), but the first episode is directed by Lena Dunham, and the writers \u2013 Mickey Down and Konrad Kay \u2013 are real finds. Although it is set in a rarefied world, it\u2019s as much about the time spent off the floor as on it: jabbing at laptops in the backs of taxis; ignoring urgent texts; the push-pull of that first ever office job where every opportunity feels like a punishment; early-20s untouchable, high-octane horniness; being bitchy about people in toilet cubicles; casually bombastic London coke use; delicately threatening levels of hierarchy and power; getting a salad order wrong and worrying it might cause you to lose your job. So many of the problems these graduates have could be solved by simply \u201cbeing 25\u201d instead of \u201cbeing 22\u201d, and that\u2019s a fascinating moment to set a drama in: one episode in particular, where Harper frantically tries to cover up a mistake at work on the back of a birthday all-nighter, feels excruciating in its sheer early-20sness. Will Industry make your skin clench tight against your flesh as if you\u2019ve had too many Red Bulls? Yes, very often. Is it completely, refreshingly addictive for it? Also yes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
