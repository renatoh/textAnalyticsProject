After her aquatic adventure on a barge in Sunday's 1,000-vessel flotilla, the Queen will be back on terra firma \u2013 and on far more familiar territory with horses and carriages \u2013 for the jubilee procession through central London on Tuesday 5 June. \"We're always at a high level of readiness so it's just those final touches and flourishes we have to do,\" said Jack Hargreaves, head coachman, as he continued the preparations. The day will feature glittering carriages, gleaming breastplates, military bands and a sovereign's escort provided by the Household Cavalry. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will ride through Whitehall in the open-topped 1902 state landau, unless the weather is wet \u2013 in which case they will use the Australian state coach. Also taking part in the carriage procession from Westminster Hall to Buckingham Palace will be the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry. The route is expected to be lined with tens of thousands of spectators \u2013 and some anti-monarchists demonstrators. The Republic campaign is planning protests at St Paul's cathedral, where the Queen will earlier attend a service of thanksgiving, and in Whitehall. The largest demonstration is planned for Sunday's Thames diamond jubilee pageant. Then, hundreds are expected to gather near the Scoop amphitheatre by City Hall on the South Bank as the royal barge passes at about 4pm. Speakers are likely to include Professor Stephen Haseler, chair of the Reform Foundation; Ted Vallance, historian of early modern Britain and author of A Radical History of Britain; Peter Tatchell, the human rights activist; and Joan Smith, the newspaper columnist and human rights activist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
