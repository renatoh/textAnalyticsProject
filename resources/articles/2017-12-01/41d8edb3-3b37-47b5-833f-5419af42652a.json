Since arriving at Bournemouth for a club-record \u00a320m in June, Ak\u00e9 has impressed in the heart of defence, although the backline was pulled apart by Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in Sunday\u2019s 4-0 defeat. Ak\u00e9 is set to play at Stamford Bridge for the first time as a Bournemouth player. He spent six years at Chelsea, starting in the academy, but made only two Premier League starts for the club, who loaned him to Watford and Bournemouth. \u201cI have nothing to prove,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cI don\u2019t go there to prove myself or things like this. It\u2019s just a game, a big game for us. We want to go to the semi-final and that\u2019s what I want to think about, not about other things. I had a good time there so it will be good to be back at the Bridge, for sure.\u201d Ak\u00e9 is confident that Bournemouth, without a win in six matches, can bounce back after the team endured a nine-match winless run at the beginning of this year, before losing two of their final 12 matches to finish ninth in the Premier League. The match at Chelsea provides a welcome distraction from their current league problems that see them sit just a point above the relegation zone. \u201cTo get to the semi-final would be really big for this club,\u201d Ak\u00e9 said. \u201cSo obviously it will be a good chance to turn this around. It will be difficult as Chelsea is not a small club but every game is difficult, so we\u2019ll go there with a positive mind and to try to win the game. \u201cWe had bad games last season and the game after we turned it around, so I think it\u2019s good that we have a game [now] so we can turn it around quick. We have to pick up from last Wednesday [a 1-0 defeat by Manchester United], the positives, and try to do that again against Chelsea. \u201cObviously they\u2019re a very good side, very good players, same as Liverpool \u2014 the front players are really dangerous. So it will be tough for us but mentally we need to prepare again and try to win the game. I think [against Liverpool] was the worst we have played in the Premier League, this season. Normally we\u2019re compact \u2014 this season defensively we\u2019ve been stronger than before but I think we were too open, conceded sloppy goals, and it was just a bad performance.\u201d Charlie Daniels and Joshua King are out for Bournemouth, with groin and hamstring injuries respectively, meaning Steve Cook and Jack Simpson could return in defence. Lys Mousset or Benik Afobe could lead the line because Callum Wilson, who received a precautionary injection in a knee last week, may be kept fresh for Saturday\u2019s league game at Manchester City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
