Suddenly all seemed well in the world for London Irish and, let's face it, for England. Before he scored that try and was mobbed by his team-mates, the biggest roar of the afternoon had been when he had came on with 15 minutes to go for his first appearance since dislocating his shoulder in September. Because this contest did not have people on the edge of their seats. The result was pretty much sealed with Irish's first try early on, and the remaining interest in a meandering match was whether they could secure that bonus point and keep abreast of Leinster at the top of the pool. They managed it, just, but they remain indebted to the referee, who brandished yellow in a Brive face a full four times. The visitors were expected to roll over and die for this one, having lost three out of three, but to their credit they dug in as much as they could have been expected to. Steve Thompson led the way, his usual bristling self in the loose, even pulling off a corner-flagging cover tackle as Irish chased their fourth try. If it had not been for James Jones's eagerness to reach for his cards \u2013 one appeared to be shown to Pat Barnard for a mere scrum infringement \u2013 they might well have not made it. Barnard's yellow, early in the second half, was followed shortly by one for Jamie Noon, who left the field utterly bewildered. So Brive defended with 13 for nearly 10 minutes in the third quarter and did very well. This was not exactly England's stand against the All Blacks in 2003, but it was worthy and only broken at the end of the spell, when Elvis Seveali'i eventually skipped through, much as Armitage would 20 minutes later. The reputation of French rugby has taken a pummelling this week, not least Brive's for their antics in the bad-tempered match between these two last week, but the French also believe they are the victims of injustice at the hands of British referees. It is easy to sympathise sometimes. Mr Jones will presumably be on London Irish's Christmas card list, if he is not already. London Irish played most of the rugby in this one, as well they might, since the onus was on them to secure that bonus point. Brive had no interest in this competition \u2013 some might wonder whether they ever did \u2013 and they restricted their early efforts to a couple of drives here and there, just before someone knocked it on. Irish scored the game's first try when some clever handling by Peter Hewat sent Tom Homer clear. That was to be the only one they would score against a full complement. Luciano Orquera and Chris Malone each kicked two penalties, as things drifted, so the referee took his first stand. Retief Uys was shown a yellow card for killing the ball and Irish scrummed the resulting penalty. Brive's seven-man pack managed to disrupt it, but the ball fell somehow to Seilala Mapusua who found a passage to the tryline through some soft tackling to give Irish a 20-6 lead at half-time. Irish's second was scored against 14, their third against 13, and, before you ask, when Armitage went over for that fourth, yes, Brive were back down to 14, this time Sam Spedding had been binned for obstruction. But the visitors held their heads high and scored the best try of the game only two minutes before Armitage's flourish, Guillaume Namy finishing off a fine spell of inter-passing. It meant the game finished on an unlikely high, which was a shame only for those who had left early. It had not been a classic. But Delon's back now, so those who stayed until the end left in a good mood. He has that effect on people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
