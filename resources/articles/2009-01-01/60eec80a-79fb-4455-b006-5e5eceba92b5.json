America doesn't torture! How kind of us. Neither, though, did we torture nine years ago. Barack Obama ended the global gag rule, allowing federal dollars to flow to non-governmental organisations that can discuss family planning, including abortions. Great news. But it's also a return to a status quo that should never have been abandoned. A handful of recent initiatives, however, are almost entirely new, and one of them is a concerted effort to recast global warming as an international concern \u2013 not just a domestic environmental and economic nuisance. The Bush administration scoffed at that interpretation. The Obama administration does not. He's the first president who takes climate change \u2013 and all of its implications \u2013 very seriously. In that spirit, Senator John Kerry, the incoming chairman of the powerful senate foreign relations committee, invited Al Gore to testify before the panel today. It would be difficult to ignore the symbolic significance of the event. Two would-be-presidents carving out a new political discussion in the committee room that helped advance the careers of the two people with the power and the will to make that discussion central \u2013 Vice-President Joe Biden, the committee's former chairman, and President Barack Obama, until recently, one of its most junior members. \"Climate change will be increasingly central to our foreign policy,\" said Kerry in his opening statement for a hearing that touched on most of the international aspects of the climate crisis \u2013 from mitigation strategies that would connect vast regions of the world (North Africa and Europe; the United States and Mexico) to the same electricity grids, to the fact that the consequences of global warming \u2013 droughts, floods, diseases \u2013 will be disproportionately borne by the poorest and least polluting peoples in the world. But action, Gore said, must start in the United States. And that means confronting Americans, and a depressing percentage of their elected representatives, with the sobering truths about climate change. If emissions continue climbing as predicted in the absence of a concerted effort to rein them in, temperatures could rise 11 degrees Fahrenheit (about six degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. \"This,\" said Gore, \"would bring a screeching halt to human civilisation and threaten the fabric of life everywhere on earth\". To avoid such a calamity, Gore said, America must follow up on recent measures, like fuel efficiency standards, and the coming efficiency measures in the stimulus package, with a carbon pricing policy and a commitment to taking a leadership role at a climate change treaty summit in Copenhagen later this year. Negotiating a successful treaty, Gore noted, will require industrialised nations to agree to reduce emissions more quickly than developing nations like China and India. The senators on the panel treated the former vice-president with due deference, but one \u2013 Bob Corker from Gore's home state of Tennessee \u2013 was more receptive than most Republicans. Corker has long suggested that addressing climate change is a pressing issue. But he has, for the most part, opposed efforts to cap and reduce carbon emissions on the grounds that most of these programmes serve, in effect, as giveaways to both moneyed polluters and clean energy companies. He has a point. Today, though, he suggested he would support a carbon pricing scheme that returned the revenue directly to citizens. Gore largely agreed with Corker, saying that a vast bulk of the revenue should be rebated, with a small percentage dedicated to clean energy research and deployment and to programmes that will help people adapt to the warming that's in our future no matter what we do. Corker also argued for an increased role for nuclear power, but Gore countered that nuclear power plants are extremely expensive, raise proliferation concerns and are subject to the scarcity of fissile material in the world. Which is all to say that the conversation was highly substantive \u2013 the opening salvo of a cooperative effort that will involve Gore, Kerry and several others, all of whom, gratefully, finally, have the ear of the president of the United States. That, in it's own small way, is real change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
