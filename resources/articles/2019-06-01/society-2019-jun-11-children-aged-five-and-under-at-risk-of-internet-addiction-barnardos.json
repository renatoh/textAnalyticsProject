The charity said very young children \u2013 one as young as two \u2013 were learning to access websites, for example YouTube and those related to children\u2019s television programmes, as a result of their parents giving them access to smartphones or tablet computers to distract or entertain them. Barnardo\u2019s is concerned that early access to electronic devices could lead to both addiction and a loss of key social skills as families spend less time talking among themselves. It warns in a report into the effects of technology and social media on children that platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter are having a \u201cdisturbing\u201d impact on the mental health of under-18s. The report said: \u201cBarnardo\u2019s practitioners raised concerns in relation to the social and emotional development of very young children when they interact with social media. \u201cWorries regarding addiction and the substitution of time spent with family for the use of social media were issues that were felt to cause problems related to mental health and emotional wellbeing in this age group. \u201cKey apprehensions included the failure to think creatively, interact with others socially and manage their own emotions.\u201d The report\u2019s findings were based on testimony from 80 support workers who work with under-18s at 30 Barnardo\u2019s projects across the UK. Many of their clients are young people who are particularly vulnerable because they are or have been in care, in a gang, or under the supervision of a pupil referral unit. The research also found that: A third of five-to-10-year-olds have been the victims of cyberbullying. Children of that age are being exposed to unsuitable or harmful material online. 79% of support workers have dealt with 11-to-15-year-olds who have suffered cyberbullying. 58% of those helping those 16 or over had seen cases of self-harm and attempted suicide linked to the young person\u2019s history of cyberbullying. 78% of support workers had come across young people of that age who had been groomed online. \u201cAlthough the internet offers incredible opportunities to learn and play, it also carries serious new risks from cyberbullying to online grooming,\u201d said Javed Khan, Barnardo\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThese risks can have a devastating impact on the lives of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d However, the charity added that social media can also offer benefits, such as reducing vulnerable young people\u2019s isolation and loneliness, and letting them link up with people like them. \u201cThese findings shine more light on the potentially harmful relationship between social media and youngsters\u2019 mental health and wellbeing, with this report suggesting it could be a problem for some children, from a very young age,\u201d said Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national mental health director. Social media platforms need to start paying a levy to help fund NHS treatment of the growing number of children and young people whose mental health is harmed by using them, Murdoch added. Barnardo\u2019s highlighted the case of an 11-year-old girl who tried to end her life after suffering cyberbullying by young people who found out that her father had been sent to prison and was on the sex offender register. \u201cI got horrible messages from children saying: \u2018Your dad\u2019s a pervert, you might as well kill yourself now.\u2019 Due to the comments, I began to hate myself and felt \u2018outside\u2019 of everything, so then I tried to kill myself,\u201d the girl told the charity. Tom Madders, campaigns director at the charity Young Minds, said: \u201cUsing phones and being online from a young age, including having access to social media accounts, has become a normal part of life for many children. The children and young people we work with tell us about the positives of using technology, but also that being exposed to harmful content or being bullied round the clock on social media can have a serious impact on their mental health.\u201d In a white paper in April on combating online harm, the government pledged to take action to tackle the problem. That included putting a new legal duty of care on providers to ensure that young users do not come to harm from accessing their content."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
