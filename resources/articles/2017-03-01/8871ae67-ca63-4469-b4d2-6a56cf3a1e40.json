The first minister\u2019s spokesperson was one of a string of politicians to criticise the tabloid over the headline, which attracted hundreds of complaints of sexism \u2013 although Downing Street refused to be drawn into the row. \u201cBrexit may risk taking Britain back to the early 1970s, but there is no need for coverage of events to lead the way,\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s spokeperson added. The Mail, meanwhile, hit back, telling its critics to \u201cget a life\u201d, and arguing that its treatment of the meeting to discuss a second Scottish referendum was meant to be \u201clight-hearted\u201d. But more than 300 people complained to press regulator Ipso over the coverage, including a double-page spread inside that focused on the two leaders\u2019 clothes and an article by Sarah Vine headlined \u201cFinest weapons at their command? Those pins!\u201d Ipso said its hands were tied unless either of the politicians themselves complained, but at an official briefing to journalists, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, James Slack, would not be drawn on the controversy surrounding the Mail, where he was political editor until recently. \u201cYou would not expect me to comment on what newspapers should or should not put on their front pages,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said at a lobby briefing. There was understood to have been a debate over the headline among the senior editing team at the Mail, which decides what to put on the front page. In the absence of editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, who rarely works on a Monday, his deputy Ted Verity was understood to have taken the decision, despite some fears that it would attract attention on a day when the Mail\u2019s other front page story was a scoop about the NHS. However, Dacre sanctioned a forthright response to the criticism on Tuesday in which a spokesperson for the Daily Mail asked whether the \u201cpo-faced BBC and leftwing commentariat, so obsessed by the Daily Mail\u201d had \u201clost all sense of humour \u2026 and proportion?\u201d. \u201cFor goodness sake, get a life! Sarah Vine\u2019s piece, which was flagged as light-hearted, was a side-bar alongside a serious political story,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIt appeared in an 84-page paper packed with important news and analysis, a front-page exclusive on cost-cutting in the NHS and a health supplement devoted to women\u2019s health issues.\u201d Yet the front page was changed for later editions to include the words, \u201cSarah Vine\u2019s light-hearted verdict on the big showdown\u201d and \u201cLegs-it\u201d was not mentioned in the Scottish Mail, which focused on the \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship between the two leaders instead. This decision by the all-male editing team to blame the female columnists provoked further accusations of sexism. ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, tweeted that \u201cthe decision to pin it on a woman\u201d was \u201cperhaps most upsetting\u201d. Vine herself appeared on the BBC\u2019s World at One to defend the front page. When the columnist said: \u201cIn the piece I don\u2019t just talk about the legs,\u201d presenter Martha Kearney responded: \u201cNo, you talk about the jackets too.\u201d Kearney also pointed out that while the serious news story made up about one-third of the coverage, \u201cLegs-it\u201d dominated the front page and two-thirds of the inside pages. The Mail also defended itself against accusations of sexism by saying, \u201cFor the record, we often comment on the appearance of male politicians including Cameron\u2019s waistline, Osborne\u2019s hair, Corbyn\u2019s clothes \u2013 and even Boris\u2019s legs.\u201d Vine said that newspapers were often rude about male politicians\u2019 appearance, including about her husband, Michael Gove. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy to stand by what I wrote. I wasn\u2019t horrid about them. I didn\u2019t insult either of them.\u201d However, Sturgeon\u2019s spokesperson was less sure. \u201cIt is slightly surprising that when the first minister of Scotland and the prime minister of the UK meet to discuss the key issues of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and giving the people of Scotland a choice over their future that the main focus should be on their legs and what they are wearing,\u201d a spokesman said. Yet several politicians pointed out the difference between holiday shots of Cameron in shorts or Boris on a bike. Those to have described the coverage included Labour MP Harriet Harman, who called the coverage \u201cmoronic\u201d and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Both Yvette Cooper and former Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Mail of reverting to the 1950s, and the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also took to Twitter over the front page. Ipso said most of the complaints accused the Mail of discrimination, a clause of the editor\u2019s code that is meant to outlaw using \u201cdetails of an individual\u2019s race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability... unless genuinely relevant to the story\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
