Lens boosted their chances of gaining a Uefa Cup place by thrashing Sedan 4-0. Goals from Daniel Moreira, John Utaka and Seydou Keita put the home side three up and out of sight by half-time. Only a last minute goal from Antoine Sibierski gave the fans anything to shout about in the second half. The result, coming after a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers AC Ajaccio, leaves Sedan hovering just above the relegation zone. Auxerre missed the chance to go level on points with the top two, Nice and Marseille, after a disapointing 0-0 draw at Montpellier. Auxerre's 2-0 midweek win over Guingamp helped them close the gap at the top but they could not take full advantage of their extra game. The result, coming on the back of Montpellier's midweek draw against Nice means that the team second from bottom have drawn against two of the top teams in their last two games. Despite a turnaround in form for the south coast club, they remain seven points from safety. Le Harve are also struggling in the relegation zone after managing only a 1-1 draw at home to Strasbourg. It could have been so much worse for the home side though as Pierre Laurent's strike threatened to give the visitorsall three points until Pascal Chimbonda's second-half equaliser. Coupled with the 1-0 loss at Paris St-Germain in midweek, the result leaves Le Harve in 18th place, four points from of safety.
