The cheerful horde jamming Dingwalls is too sunstruck to sink into the despondency necessary to appreciate fully this much-admired new songwriter. And heaven knows he's miserable, poised between the obscurity of his Hackney garret and a major role in the so-called new acoustic movement. His self-titled debut album, which appeared last autumn to high praise and a spread in Vogue, finds its own niche in the oversubscribed category of sensitive singer-songwriters by having a hefty axe to grind. Unlike such rivals as David Gray, McRae is less the bedsit daydreamer than the raygun-wielding avenger out to bump off former friends and lovers. This gives him more in common with revengemeister Morrissey, and the spite that trickles into his performance is worthy of Big M himself. His first words, introducing You Cut Her Hair, are: \"This is a happy little song about tracking somebody down, finding where they live and killing them.\" Ignoring a gust of you-cannot-be-serious giggles, he leans into the mike and keens, \"I will find you still, move in for the kill\", thrashing his guitar to the funereal tempo picked out by a cellist and drummer. Temporarily stilled by the chill in his voice, people shuffle uncomfortably. As the next song, The Boy With the Bubblegun, fades away, its last line - \"If songs could kill, this one's for you\" - lingering like a freezing mist, a bloke at the back recovers enough to shout for REM's Shiny Happy People. \"If you expect happy songs, you've come to the wrong show,\" McRae returns with a sardonic smile. He's as good as his word. Each tuneful melody (McRae is almost alone among the new-acoustic crowd in his ability to write a decent chorus) is like a bullet, fired home by cracked vocals that test the upper limit of his choirboy range. They are augmented by the sighing cello and a rhythm section that occasionally breaks into a trot, even whisking up an incongruous samba rhythm on A &amp; B Song. This is melodrama at its ripest, the revenge of the thwarted romantic who is going to sing and sing until he's sick, and sneer at suggestions that he get a grip. It gets, dare one venture, a trifle tedious toward the end. But if the choice is McRae or Gray, melodrama will out over blandness every time."}, "isHosted": false}}}
