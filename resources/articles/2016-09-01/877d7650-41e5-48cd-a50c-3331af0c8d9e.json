Our audience research shows that the BBC was the most trusted reporter of the referendum. In fact, our scores for trust rose as the campaign progressed. Complaints were low. And more than 90% of people in the UK came to the BBC during the campaign for the news. That said, there have been two strands of criticism of our coverage. On the one hand, some Leavers have said the BBC reported impartially and accurately through the course of the campaign, but, since the vote of 23 June, we have returned to what they say are our true EU-luvvie colours and our reporting of the prospects for Brexit Britain has been gloomy or hysterical. On the other, some Remainers have complained that we have been too impartial \u2013 that our unthinking insistence on balance meant we treated Remain and Leave arguments with equivalence, giving the same treatment to respected experts as to know-nothings and lightweights. Worse, the criticism has gone, we abandoned our duty to inform the public: the Leavers\u2019 exaggerations, distortions and downright lies, they say, were given the same airtime as the Remainers\u2019 evidence-based judgments. Impartial reporting, this argument goes, is contributing to the problem of post-truth politics. It is easy to dismiss these critics as regular BBC bashers or sore losers. But the BBC has no business being complacent. It is worth making a few points that, I hope, show that we are alive to our critics. The Leavers\u2019 complaint will, in no small part, be answered by what happens next and how we report it. The fact is that, since the EU referendum, there has been a revaluation of sterling, the Bank of England cut interest rates because it says the outlook for economic growth has weakened markedly and the government\u2019s plans for Brexit are unclear. But consumer confidence has bounced back and manufacturing and services sectors have rebounded accordingly. In the months ahead, our job is to understand what Brexit actually means \u2013 without relish or alarm. The Remainers who grieve at the result have blamed the BBC. But they know that the BBC did not choose to hold the referendum, frame the question, decide the timing of the vote, agree the reform package with Brussels or set the terms, tone and talking points of the campaign. Nor was the BBC responsible for the approach of the big political parties to the campaign. Labour chose to operate separately from Stronger In. Downing Street refused to send out Conservative cabinet ministers to rebut arguments made by prominent Tory Leavers live on air, because they insisted that \u201cblue on blue\u201d arguments would turn the national debate into a Westminster soap opera. Unsurprisingly, the BBC did not carry water for the government: our job is to challenge politicians, not to serve as a rebuttal unit or advocate the alternative argument. One other point: inasmuch as the EU referendum was about the economy, it was about forecasts more than facts. It was not a contest of hard truths but an argument over whose predictions of the future you preferred. The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain. But the BBC, at all times, should be open to those who may challenge a consensus \u2013 not all such opinions stand the test of time. (And, for the avoidance of doubt, that does not mean any crank heretic can come along and think they can take a pop at a point of historical, scientific or social fact.) The fundamental charge \u2013 that BBC reporting resulted in a false balance in which fanciful claims got the same billing as serious insights \u2013 is not true. We were keenly aware of this risk, precisely because the BBC had been so roundly criticised by the scientific community over climate change. For the uninitiated: \u201cfalse balance\u201d means thinking wrongly that you have to give pro and anti equal airtime, regardless of the facts, editorial judgment and the expertise of the interviewee. The BBC\u2019s rules are clear. We have to deliver \u201cdue impartiality\u201d and \u201cbroad balance\u201d, terms designed to ensure that we are free to make judgments on the validity of stories, that we challenge facts and figures, that we acknowledge that different people speak with different levels of authority on a subject. The editorial guidelines that we spend a great deal of time thinking through make clear that balance is not measured with a stopwatch. So, if you go back, you will see that the squeakier claims made by politicians were challenged again and again by our presenters and correspondents. Go back and look at Evan Davis take on Douglas Carswell over the claim that voting Leave would bring \u00a3350m a week back into UK coffers; watch David Dimbleby take on Michael Gove\u2019s dismissal of the IFS; read what Reality Check said about George Osborne\u2019s forecast that voting Leave would cost each home \u00a34,300; watch Andrew Neil pick apart Nigel Farage\u2019s numbers on immigration. Or Kamal Ahmed on the 6pm and 10pm bulletins saying: \u201cThe economic consensus is on one side of this debate.\u201d I could go on and on. The Remainers\u2019 criticism does not stand up. No one who watched the BBC during the campaign could have been left in any doubt that President Obama, the governor of the Bank of England, the IMF, OECD, IFS, CBI, prime minister, chancellor and, yes, both David Beckham and Jeremy Clarkson believed Britain should remain in the EU. People who voted out made up their own minds and did so knowing that all those people thought it was a bad idea. If some people who believe in the benefits of EU membership think they lost the referendum because their case was not sufficiently heard on the BBC, I can\u2019t help feeling they may be missing the point of the 52%. It is impossible to generalise on what 17.5 million voters were saying, but it was a vote for a change. We plainly do not get everything right. We make mistakes and, I hope, move quickly to grip them. More than that, there is a real issue about how newsrooms can get beyond the noise to the news. This means thinking differently about reporting stories, the resources we put into data analysis, and the prominence we give to context. But no one wants paternalistic news. The BBC\u2019s job is not to preside over the democratic process \u2013 it is to report, to host the argument and to interrogate the participants. We aim to inform our audiences, not seek the approval of politicians or pundits. That is what we sought to do in this difficult and contentious contests. And it is what we continue to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
