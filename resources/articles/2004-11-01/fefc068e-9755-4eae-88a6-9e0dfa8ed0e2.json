The wedding-cake couple, dad's speech, confetti, the white car dangling beer cans. Later, a Dyson, ultrasound pictures, Baby Gap, garden swings. It's a desire young women inherit and dream about, apparently. Pop culture's commentators regularly recycle it. Most recent is More magazine's 21st-century young woman's survey of Great Britain. This survey of 5,000 18- to 25-year-olds indicates that nine out of 10 want to marry, two-thirds want to have their children in wedlock and eight out of 10 want to give up work to look after them. Young women are the new traditionalists, it's claimed. Emerging hurt from broken homes, they crave familial stability. Stressed out by too many exams, they'd rather score points with their longed-for kids than use their degrees and GNVQs in the labour market. We could interpret this as a backlash against 20th-century fights to widen women's opportunities and provide escape routes from unhappy or abusive marriages. Feminists sigh in exasperation when ill-informed spokespeople parrot: \"Women have finally realised that they can't have it all\" (whatever \"it\" is supposed to be). Generous enough to measure social progress by the attitudes of the next generation, feminists are distressed: surely this shows that equal-opportunities Britain's going down the pan? There is, actually, little cause for alarm. First, it's doubtful that young women really show such longing for marriage. Claiming that readers of More are representative of all young women is about as silly as alleging that Loaded typifies young men. Better-trained researchers like the National Centre for Social Research, producer of the British Social Attitudes surveys, demonstrate a decreasing desire for marriage among young people. A recent BSA survey shows that only 30% of 18- to-24-year-olds think people who want children should get married, 85% find cohabitation without the intention of marrying acceptable, and 86% disagree with the idea that married people are happier than singletons. Similarly, interviews carried out by Shelley Budgeon, a University of Birmingham sociologist, reveal a far broader range of opinions than More's survey. While a minority of young women advocate traditional patterns of femininity, more defer this to an indeterminate future, wanting instead to \"live my own life\" before \"settling down\". Young women want equality and autonomy in marriage and anticipate negotiating and struggling to achieve these. Others reject marriage, preferring cohabitation or childlessness. S econd, and granted that some young women do favour a conservative approach to family life, it's not so much that they are revisiting traditional ways; simply that they think they want to. This generation of women won't \"return\" to the home; they just like to think they might. Yearnings for marital \"simplicity\" represent only nostalgia for lives they'll never live. Social shifts and women's own choices confirm this. The decline in marriage shows no sign of abating. Only half the population are married, and people are entering their first marriages later. Marriages fail more frequently - between 1971 and 2001 divorce doubled. Fewer women become mothers, and at least a quarter of young women are predicted to remain childless. Those who have children are increasingly opting to do so outside marriage; in the past 20 years births outside marriage have more than tripled. Women are also entering employment in greater numbers, while male economic activity is falling (despite the fact that men receive higher wages and are more likely to work full time). High living standards and property prices make dual incomes a virtual necessity; the state can no longer provide sufficient pensions for its citizens; women have to support themselves if they get divorced. Women, therefore, have no choice but to go out to work. And as girls' educational qualifications surpass boys', more careers than ever are open to them. So when young women say they want to be housewives, it doesn't mean that they will. Pro-marriage attitudes exemplify this post-feminist culture in which beliefs and behaviour do not cohere, and image and articulation are more important than what one does. Saying they want to settle down is a way they rehearse what femininity might, but will not, involve. The adult signifiers of marriage and motherhood are tried on, yet in practice rejected. Traditional femininity is largely a matter of masquerade. Young women say they want to marry, but that doesn't mean they will. They say divorce is wrong, but they head for the courts more than twice as often as men if they're mistreated or cheated on. Flirting with fantasies of prince-like husbands and PTA meetings has become more possible as the likelihood of such dreams coming true has faded. Young women can articulate pre-feminist desires safe in the knowledge that their options are far wider, and far fairer. So don't think young women are going back to basics - they recognise, even when others don't, the difference between fantasy and fact. \u00b7 Kristin Aune is assistant director of Youth and Community Work at Ridley Hall, Cambridge kristin.aune@kcl.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
