Santos\u2019s message will be: the whole policy needs to be rethought, with a different set of priorities. President Santos first called for an overhaul in policy towards drugs in an interview with this newspaper in 2011, urging that \u201ca new approach should try and take away the violent profit that comes with drug trafficking\u201d. He has continued to drive that conversation forward with the moral authority bestowed by leading a country that was nearly destroyed by the violence and corrupting influence of cartel money on the police, judiciary and the body politic. It was close to a failed state in the late 90s and it was drugs that did that damage. Now Santos is at it again, presenting the UN with a four-point plan to challenge the drugs crisis. And he does so in a unique context: for four years in Havana, Santos\u2019s government has been locked in peace talks with Farc, which mainly funds itself through narco traffic. Under the peace accord soon to be signed, Farc is poised to become an ally of the government in trying to eradicate coca production in favour of other agricultural activity. Colombia\u2019s attempt to change the conversation on the drugs war has been forcefully supported by Guatemala, Ecuador and Bolivia. And drug policy has become a live issue in countries such as Portugal, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Brazil. The governments of two nations have been noticeable by their reluctance to engage in Colombia\u2019s initiatives: the US and UK, among the countries that consume the most hard drugs per capita in the world, and where the banks are based that have been caught and admitted laundering the bloody profits of narco traffic with effective impunity (Wachovia and HSBC). This is a disgrace. WAR ON DRUGS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
