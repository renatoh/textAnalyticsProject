The correspondent had confessed to Dolly Doctor the details of a masturbation habit that \u2013 from memory \u2013 involved not only the somewhat expected banana but entirely surprising nectarines. My best friend, reading the magazine aloud, attempted to intone the seriousness of the young woman\u2019s concern between bouts of hysterical giggles. Am I normal? pleaded the letter. We roared. By the time it came to read the doctor\u2019s soft advice, my best friend was laughing too hard to keep reading. There were maybe four of us, in various combinations of pyjama, rolling about the floor of my best friend\u2019s father\u2019s flat, stuffed with cake and overflowing with the full flavours of teenage nastiness; judging others without mercy, inflating the self by deflating the other, engaging in a competitive \u201cnormalcy\u201d that would avow a solid, conformist puritanism within seconds of pretending to some detailed, wild experience. We were 14, maybe 15, and many times we splayed ourselves on that floor and other floors across our suburban wilderness, reading Dolly magazines aloud to mock the readership we imagined for them: girls less cool than us, less funny, younger, stupid, too dumb to guess what boys were doing to them, paranoid and insecure around sex, taste, love and clumsy at masturbation. We were, of course, that precise audience ourselves; awkward and uncomfortable, personalities squeezed and misshapen by bodies fast outgrowing the selfhood demanded to manage them. It\u2019s extraordinary to consider the amount of pretending that teenagers do at the same time they fail to recognise it in others. Our adolescent narcissism insisted on \u201cthe fruit one\u2019s\u201d veracity, even as we subsequently spent hours comprising our own made-up Dolly Doctor letters in response to it, outdoing one another\u2019s suggestions for dirtiness. I clearly remember, \u201cWhat about \u2018I fuck Lego\u2019?\u201d shouted across the room. Now, Dolly magazine, having falling victim to the digital world, is ceasing to print after 46 years. Recalling that precise evening in the early 90s, the slick pages of the magazine, the taste of cake, the fibres of the carpet, I am provoked to profound respect of the adult writers and editors who engaged all those years of teenage nonsense. No matter how outrageous the teenage suggestion, Dolly\u2019s voice was always steady: yes, you\u2019re normal, but if it\u2019s causing pain or problems in your life, please see a doctor. As kids, we thought the advice was individual but the lesson was collective. I was never too preoccupied with fruit, but when only a couple of years later it took me a couple of weeks too many to recover from a broken heart, the repeated, gentle message to seek out some extra help was soundly heeded. Please remember, the feminist revolution took place in the space of a historical blink \u2013 my own generation were offered experiences our mothers had never imagined. These magazines guided us through new social-sexual territories our own parents couldn\u2019t know \u2013 and of which we could not tell them. Australian writer Casey Bennetto was opining on Facebook recently his concern that the \u201cmorality plays\u201d of gentle sitcoms that taught our generation of young people mores and consequences has been superseded by years of reality television that instead rewards behaviour at its most entertaining and extreme. I contemplate the end of Dolly magazine and I ponder similar consequences in magazine media, and its specific effect on young girls. There was a message consistency that came from Dolly \u2013 of respect, self-care, boundaried behaviour \u2013 that we learned from their careful editorial even as we thought we were laughing at it. The self-selected, click-bait channels of post-truth internet swap it for chaos. Dear fruit-lover, you may indeed be normal, but whose voice can you now trust to tell you so?
