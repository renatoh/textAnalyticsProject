Just over \u00a34.3m of that long-term incentive money went to Endemol's highest paid director for their work in the 12 months to December 31, 2004. The \u00a312.222m in bonus payments went to 11 Endemol directors, including chief executive Tom Barnicoat, chairman Peter Bazalgette and chief creative officer Tim Hincks. Endemol made an operating loss of \u00a35.188m in 2004, compared to a profit of \u00a31.824m the previous year. This was despite the company increasing turnover from \u00a389.828m in 2003 to \u00a397.395m last year. A company spokesman said the payments came under an incentive scheme put in place when Dutch parent Endemol first took a stake in the UK independent producer seven years ago and reflected its successful growth during that period. \"Since 1998 our average growth in turnover and underlying profits has been more than 20% year on year,\" the spokesman added. \"Last year was one of our most successful ever, with more than 8,000 hours of programming produced, 36 new commissions, and 147 shows on air in total,\" he said. Money paid out to Endemol's directors leapt by nearly \u00a38m year on year, from \u00a34.411m to \u00a312.222m. Their total remumeration in 2004 came to \u00a313.542m, including \u00a31.204m in salaries and fees. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
