The new cabinet won fair-minded plaudits yesterday as being shrewd and inclusive. The contrast with the reshuffle shambles that marked the Blair years is tempting. But the new prime minister is a strategist rather than tactician. Almost uniquely he has had months to pick his team, not a weekend scramble under the lash of events. That will come later. Even so, things can go wrong on the day, as they routinely do in a house sale chain. Nominees can change their minds or sulk. Prime minister Brown - the title stills jars on the news bulletins - has picked competent managers from the restricted parliamentary talent pool, though few of the colourful characters of yesteryear. On Radio 4, Alistair Darling boldly made the case for dull as this season's colour, though he can surely afford more jokes now. He may need them as the economic weather darkens. Mr Brown has also refrained from putting all known Blairites up against a wall. As the Latin American general said \"treason is a matter of dates\" and last autumn's young \"Blairites for Brown\" - notably James Purnell (culture) and \"Handy Andy\" Burnham ( Treasury No 2) have prospered. Both are a mere 37 and clever, but are not any kind of threat. To the extent that Brown's well-constructed cabinet contains threats at all they have been gently parked. John Hutton, who was capable of standing up to the Treasury on pensions policy, has been given the rebranded and reduced Department of Trade and Industry, a hard task. As for the current heir apparent, always a dangerous title, David Miliband gets the Foreign Office plum and the grandest office in Whitehall. Bags of opportunity to broaden his range there, but also lots of travel, lots of time away from the domestic agenda where Mr Brown will concentrate his efforts as Mr Blair fatally did not. To underline his own authority Mr Brown has nevertheless given Douglas Alexander international development with an enhanced brief on trade. It includes the world trade talks where he will mark the Blairite Brussels exile, Peter Mandelson. The appointment of Mark Malloch Brown, ex-UN apparatchik, to the Lords, so far the sole imaginative appointment from outside the Westminster tent, may help persuade a suspicious Mr Brown that diplomacy sometimes matters more than even his beloved economics. Mr Brown's overriding interests, Britain's deficient skills base and poverty, both home and abroad, are evident in the restructuring of Whitehall departments. There may be more to come. Today the cabinet meets - a rare Friday session - to discuss constitutional reform, perhaps a convention on the Scottish model. All the same some sensitivities and quirks remain to be teased out. New Labour's \"Scottish raj\" which so inflamed the Tory press is reduced to four, including the top two spots, Brown and Darling, who along with Jack Straw are the sole survivors of the 1997 cabinet. Margaret Beckett, first a minister in 1976, is finally out. But Jacqui Smith, a popular colleague, becomes the first female home secretary in a job that has been divided and diminished. Five women against eight last week are buttressed by three female attendees, including the steely QC, Lady Scotland, who inherits Lord Goldsmith's file of horrors. Harriet Harman, very much a love-her-or-loathe-her politician, will be leader of the Commons after all. Some MPs fear that will strain her diplomatic skills. In a distinctly family cabinet, the Brothers Miliband plus the Cooper-Ballses, there is only one peer, Lady Ashton, surely a record, and one 60-plus (Straw) against five under 40. As unpaid Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward may be the first supermarket-sponsored cabinet member (his wife is a Sainsbury heir). Apart from Des Browne, left at defence, it is all change and yet the Brown cabinet will feel familiar until new personalities have had time to grow. It remains New Labour elitist, only one non-graduate, Postman Johnson (health). Thirteen of the 22 went to Oxbridge, most of the rest to ancient Scottish universities. How it works out time will tell. But one Labour MP felt moved to tell Mr Brown recently that he has a big advantage over Tony Blair: \"You won't have Gordon Brown to deal with.\" The MP is not waiting by his phone for a job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
