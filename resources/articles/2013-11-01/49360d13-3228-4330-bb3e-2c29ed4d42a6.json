After the Flamenco of their 3-0 triumph in the Mestalla back in September, the Welsh club's progress has become something of a hokey-cokey. According to the manager, Michael Laudrup, they had one leg in the last 32 in October, only to take it out when they twice conceded stoppage-time equalisers to the also-rans of Kuban Krasnodar. They shook it all about vigorously against Valencia at the Liberty Stadium on Thursday night but were second-best against composed Spanish opposition and Daniel Parejo's first-half goal left them with one win in their last seven matches. It will not get easier for Laudrup and his charges: they are away to Manchester City on Sunday and they will go into that game without their leading scorer, Wilfried Bony, who injured a hamstring here. \"It could be quite serious,\" Laudrup said. \"We're talking about several weeks.\" Valencia's present team are a mundane bunch by comparison with Rafa Ben\u00edtez's stellar cast of the early 2000s and arrived in south Wales standing a miserable 11th in La Liga, having lost four of their last six games, but Swansea themselves are scarcely in irresistible form and were not at full strength. Laudrup had warned his players that the Spaniards were capable of an upset, and so it proved. For most of the game Valencia were the more composed, cohesive team. Nevertheless it was Swansea who should have taken an early lead, only for Bony to be found wanting twice in the first 13 minutes. First Jonjo Shelvey sent Roland Lamah sprinting away on the left and the Belgian's cross picked out the striker's run to the near post, but Bony's header from eight yards flew wastefully wide. On the second occasion Alejandro Pozuelo's corner from the left was flapped by Diego Alves straight to Bony, who again nodded wide of the gaping net. Flapping by the Valencia goalkeeper appeared to be infectious. In the 21st minute Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel caught, or rather did not catch, it and Juan Bernat's mishit volley reached Parejo who, 12 yards out in the inside-right channel, shot low inside Tremmel's left upright. Things were not going to plan for Laudrup and his team. Bony limped out of the game after 42 minutes, the \u00a312m man left to rue his profligacy as much as his injury, and it took a last-ditch challenge by Shelvey to shut out Jonas in front of goal. Bad became worse just before half-time when Alvaro V\u00e1zquez, on for Bony, had an equaliser contentiously disallowed because Shelvey was in an offside position in the build-up. Laudrup disputed the decision, saying \"he was a yard onside\", but he appeared to be referring to V\u00e1zquez, rather than Shelvey. Seeking a greater measure of control, or at least stability, in midfield, Swansea sent on Jonathan De Guzm\u00e1n in place of Lamah for the second half but it was Valencia who should have made the game safe in the 50th minute when a lovely through-ball from Sergio Canales left Sofiane Feghouli one-on-one with Tremmel. The supply had been exquisite but the finish did it scant justice, Feghouli poking the ball wide. There was a whimsical incident just before the hour when Jordi Amat, the Swansea central defender, went off to change his shirt and was twice refused permission to return to the pitch because the replacement jerseys on offer had the wrong names on the back. Amo and Amas? The Swans put in the stronger finish and V\u00e1zquez had a shot cleared off the line by J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu late on but Angel Rangel joined Bony and Michu among the walking wounded and all three will miss the trip to the Etihad, where Laudrup will be without a conventional striker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
