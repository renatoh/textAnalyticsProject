Don't read on if you haven't seen the seventh episode \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that other readers may not have done so \u2026 Kathy Sweeney's episode six blog \"Sometimes living is far worse than dying\u2026\" Jimmy Darmody This week revenge and the struggle to put the past where it belongs are recurring themes for the main characters in a slightly slower-paced episode. In Chicago, Jimmy learns the whereabouts of the man who slashed Pearl's face, and helps another disfigured person, Richard Harrow, a former sniper in the war who has had half his face blown off and replaced with a mask. They meet at a veteran's hospital, where Jimmy's having his leg examined. \"This is fine work,\" says the doctor, smoking a cigarette while examining Jimmy's horribly mangled leg. Jimmy, who is becoming quite the criminal mastermind, has plans for Richard, and takes him back to the brothel where he lives and introduces him to Odette. She leads him upstairs, offering \"the thanks of a grateful nation\". Jack Huston's performance is captivating \u2013 Harrow is an interesting addition to the storyline of soldier turned gangster. Later, Jimmy confronts Liam, the gangster who slashed Pearl's face in a cafe. He casually sits down. \"Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you, \"Jimmy tells him, Michael Corleone-style. He then delivers This Week's Monologue \u2013 the first world war story of a wounded German soldier he shot, who fought to stay alive despite being stuck in barbed wire, even though living would be worse than dying. When the story is over, Jimmy tells Liam to leave town, then gets up, pats him on the shoulder and leaves the restaurant. We hear a gunshot, and realise Liam has been shot by marksman Harrow from a building across the street. The camera artfully zooms through the bullet hole in the glass of the cafe window, into a room across the street where Richard quickly packs up his gun. Hopefully that's not the last we will see of him. \"You may think you're king, but you're not worth a goddamn\u2026\" Nucky's father Nucky spends a great deal of the episode preoccupied with family matters after his father, the vile, filthy misanthrope who we saw heckling everyone at the St Patrick's dinner, falls and breaks his leg while cursing his cats. Eli wants him to move in with him as \"the kids love him\", which seems a spectacularly unlikely claim. He seems to be the only person in Atlantic City who sees Eli as the son who made good and it seems Nucky still wants his approval. It hardly ranks as one of the series' great surprises that Nucky didn't have an ideal childhood, and it does feel a tad unoriginal when we see him looking around the house, his face etched with a mixture of nostalgia and disgust. He plans to renovate his father's derelict house and give it to Fleming, a young ward boss who is raising a young family. Nucky has a sad, faraway look as Fleming talks about his wife's efforts to keep their baby alive. As work on the house progresses though, memories of his father's abuse begin to flood back. So he sets fire to it and watches it burn, perhaps purging his demons as Fleming looks on, aghast. \"Find a better place to live,\" advises Nucky, handing a huge wad of bills to his friend, so often the solution to any problem. Clich\u00e9d or not, this is one of the first times we've felt sorry for Nucky. \"I'm no stranger to man's cruelty. Sometimes it's best to leave the past where it is\u2026\" Margaret Meanwhile Margaret has taken fellow concubine Annabelle's advice not to let her man reveal his emotions to her \u2013 the more he ends up seeing his own weaknesses reflected in her, the less he'll want to see her. But Nucky seems irritated when she coldly cuts him off during his emotional tale of how his father branded him with a poker for reaching for the bread first. Later, Margaret asks him searching questions about a stolen baseball mitt, and he coldly dismisses her, \"I don't want to talk about it.\" It turns out his father challenged him to fight the bullies who stole his mitt. He was badly beaten and in hospital for 11 days. Nucky's scars, it seems, are not just emotional. Margaret is struggling to navigate her complicated relationship with Nucky. On the upside, he's providing a future for her children, and her with the exciting lifestyle she craves. But is she really empowering herself with this arrangement? Meanwhile, we discover that Angela, Jimmy's fianc\u00e9e, is rather more \"bohemian\" than Gillian had thought and has been having an affair not with the photographer, as Jimmy suspected, but with his wife. We also find out that the only other man at the massacre at the start of the series came to Van Alden and ratted out both Jimmy and Al Capone. Agent Van Alden now has a witness who is willing to testify that Jimmy was responsible for the truck heist in the first episode, and is visibly thrilled about this. We are also introduced to another notorious real-life hood in the form of Michael Lewis, which we later find out is an alias for Meyer Lansky. The sharply dressed gangster tries to make a deal with Chalky White on behalf of the New York mob to cut out Nucky but Chalky refuses, believing that Nucky is testing his loyalty. \"Tell Nucky Thompson it's gonna take a lot more than 10 grand to get me to fuck him over.\" Obviously Chalky is a great character \u2013 although he is used rather sparingly, along with Van Alden. But it feels slightly odd seeing him in a show set in the 1920s. He looks and sounds wrong for the era. He turns up at a club to confront Nucky, where he endures casual racism (\"You people certainly are a lively bunch!\"). Nucky of course doesn't know anything about Michael Lewis, and Chalky's \"So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Y'all have a good time\" did little to distance his character from Omar. With his arrival and Lucky Luciano plotting and scheming to rob one of Nucky's casinos, things look set to heat up next week. Notes \u2022 What will Jimmy's friendship with Harrow mean for Capone, now that Jimmy has found someone he has more in common with? \u2022 Lucy watched Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde alone, as she perceived Nucky to be changing before her eyes. On screen, we see the title card read Jekyll's thoughts: \"Think what it would mean! To yield to every evil impulse \u2013 yet leave the soul untouched!\" Is she plotting her revenge? \u2022 The test Jimmy refused to take in hospital was the Woodworth personal data survey (WPDS), a test developed by Dr Robert Woodworth to help determine which military recruits would suffer \"shell shock\" when fighting overseas. It has been called the first personality test and was highly influential in developing future personality inventories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
