Police who had been searching for the 15-year-old, who disappeared from the family home after an argument three weeks ago, said they were not treating the death as suspicious. Rosemary's father, David, said the family were \"completely shell-shocked\" by the discovery of the body. Speaking from his home in Dibden Purlieu, which borders the New Forest, Mr Edwards, a computer programmer, told the local Daily Echo: \"Rosemary touched so many people's lives. It seems impossible to believe she was so low that she felt life wasn't worth living.\" On a newspaper message site that the family had used to publicise Rosemary's disappearance, her mother, Jennifer, wrote: \"People look for blame and answers but sometimes there is no one to blame. Some questions can never be answered.\" A keen horse rider and talented student who already had a GCSE A-grade in maths and a B in art, Rosemary had been due to return to school on the day she went missing. Her body was found by two walkers on Sunday in an area of the New Forest known as Busketts Lawn Inclosure, near Bartley, 10 miles from her home. The discovery came just days after a \u00a3100,000 reward was offered for the teenager's safe return. Rosemary's brother, Robert, 19, posted a tribute to his sister on the Facebook website. He said: \"Rosemary had a fantastically good 15 years of life and will be missed by all, especially her friends and family. We don't know what could have happened in Rosemary's life to lead her to the circumstances that have occurred. But I know deep down that she knew that so many people loved her and cared for her.\" Rosemary had not been seen since 10.30pm on Tuesday September 4, when she went to her bedroom after an argument with her parents. They had banned her from horse riding and other activities after finding out she had lied over how she lost her part-time job in a shop. Mr Edwards, who was the last to see her when he went to her bedroom to say goodnight, has written of his regret at their last conversation together and his torment in blaming himself for her disappearance and of the events that led up to it. Writing on an internet forum before his daughter's body was found, he said: \"Rosemary told us she had left her part-time job, but we later found out that she had been sacked for a minor transgression which shocked her employer and us because it was so totally out of character. \"As parents, we didn't want this to be the start of Rosemary going off the rails, so we imposed a short ban on accessing the internet and a longer ban on horse riding.\" He later realised, from texts and emails he had found, that she was going through \"some kind of torment in her head ... I played the blame game for the first few days, but it is very self-destructive, on top of all the other emotions.\" He said that when he last saw her he asked for a hug, but she refused. He then gave her a kiss on the cheek. He added: \"I wish I'd said how much I loved her, but how many other parents do this constantly just in case it could be the last time you see your son or daughter?\" Police said a post mortem examination was being carried out yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
