That was a long time ago, though, and I gather Sean has been kept busy in a parallel universe of films and TV programmes I haven't seen. As an attempt to parody the sword-and-sorcery genre, Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon has some fundamental problems. First, it fails to demonstrate even a grudging respect for the thing it's taking the piss out of, which means it has all the internal logic, dramatic conviction and narrative thrust of a three-minute sketch. Secondly, it relies heavily on a single comic conceit, namely that the hopeless band of resistance fighters led by Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon spend most of their time bickering like office colleagues on an away-day team-building exercise. But the biggest problem is that Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon isn't very funny. I laughed once or twice at the beginning, out of a spirit of expectant generosity - in the belief, maybe, that the pace of the thing would carry it over the ruts and bumps in the script. But the pace flagged and the ruts were too deep. It's tempting to imagine how much funnier the episode might have seemed if just a few of the worst jokes were excised. \"I'm Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon, and I'll be your liberator today,\" says Maguire as he enters a dungeon full of prisoners. Someone should have been fired just for letting that line stay in, and yet someone else thought it was funny enough to include in the trailer. Maguire, to my surprise, is a rather deft comic straight man in the mould of Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun. As the evil Chancellor Dongalor, Matt Lucas wrings everything he can out of the thin material, without letting the strain show too much, but the whole caper was pretty shopworn, and there was a running gag about Kr\u00f6d's girlfriend not wearing any underwear, which was frankly a little unpleasant. Will I be tuning in next time? Probably. Like the makers of Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon, my standards aren't very high. Satirising the middle classes on telly also has its inherent difficulties. To a large extent, your target and your audience are one and the same; who else would be interested? There's always a danger of resorting to wide-of-the-mark caricature, but if you're too subtle you run the risk of being insufficiently savage. And aren't traditional middle-class preoccupations simply too dreary to warrant a full-scale comic assault? Good schools, lamb shanks, house prices - who cares? May Contain Nuts (ITV1) neatly bypasses these worries by dragging us into a dark, claustrophobic world: a gated community in London ruled by pushy mother Ffion, who is a sort of Lord Voldemort of middle-class aspiration. Fresh arrivals David and Alice Chapin are initially bewildered by their new social circle, where ghastly parents deploy their children as proxies for their own ambitions; but, rather than becoming channels for our disapproval, the Chapins plunge right in. Alice is soon obsessed with the idea of her daughter Molly going to a prestigious private school, and when it becomes clear that Molly won't pass the entrance exam, Alice decides to step in and take it for her. This would be a preposterous development if it weren't for the casting of Shirley Henderson as Alice: she really looks as if she could carry off the deceit. \"I'm short, flat-chested,\" she tells her husband, \"and last year they charged me half-price at the cinema.\" Even so, transforming her into a fresh-faced 11-year-old proves impossible. So they turn her into an ugly 11-year-old instead. And, even if she passes as a student, it's far from certain she'll be able to pass the exam. Adapted from John O'Farrell's novel, May Contain Nuts is only a two-parter, which makes for a hectic pace. The Chapins move from bemused detachment to contemplating a fraud none of the other characters would consider in the blink of an eye. The performances, however, lift it just clear of absurdity and make it both funny and chilling. Elizabeth Berrington's Ffion is a particularly satisfying creation, both monstrously over-the-top and frighteningly close to home. It's unlikely that the smug middle classes will actually recognise themselves in any of these characters. But they will certainly recognise their neighbours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
