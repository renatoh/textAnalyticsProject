How the US kills people in 2015", "bodyText": "On Monday night, Utah\u2019s governor signed into law a bill that makes Utah the only state in the union to allow the firing squad as a method of executing condemned inmates. One other state, Oklahoma, allows for death by firing squad but only if the lethal injection process is ruled unconstitutional by a court. Why the firing squad? Since 2011, the Europe-based manufacturers of the most common execution drugs have refused to sell them to American prisons. They flat-out disagree with the practice, and hope that cutting off the source of the drugs will eventually lead the US to stop executing people. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reported on the boycott at the time: \u201cThough the new restricted list covers the only two drugs currently used in American death penalties, the fear is that intrepid states will find a way round the controls by using other sedatives not on the list.\u201d And he was right. Since the ban, some states have simply stopped executing people, and by 2013 the number of executions in the US hit its lowest point since 1994. Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, Maryland and New York have all passed legislation to end the practice in the last decade. Pennsylvania\u2019s governor instituted a moratorium in February to investigate the state\u2019s capital punishment system. That leaves the handful of states that still execute people \u2013 largely Florida, Texas, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma \u2013 struggling with a dwindling supply of drugs and turning toward other methods. They have most often chosen compounding pharmacies, companies that cook up made-to-order cocktails that resemble the drugs they used to get from the European companies. And they have done so secretly, as states pass laws to protect the makers of the drugs from public disclosure. (The Guardian has sued in several of those states.) Or, they do what Utah did on Monday, and take another route entirely. \u201cWe would love to get the lethal injection worked out so we can continue with that but if not, now we have a backup plan,\u201d Utah state representative Paul told the Associated Press. But the firing squad? Though it may seem a relic from the distant past, it was only 10 years ago that the state actually did away with the shooting people to death. Inmates sentenced before 2004 were given the option to choose the firing squad over lethal injection, which is how in 2010 Ronnie Lee Gardner became the last person executed in the US by firing squad. Ray first proposed the firing squad bill last May, a month after Oklahoma\u2019s botched execution of Clayton Lockett. \u201cIt sounds like the wild west, but it\u2019s probably the most humane way to kill somebody,\u201d Ray said. Is it more humane? Ronnie Lee Gardner\u2019s brother, Randy, says no. \u201cThere\u2019s no humane way to execute anyone,\u201d Randy Gardner told NBC news on Monday. \u201cI had the opportunity to see my brother after four bullets hit his chest, and I could have put my hand in anyone of the holes. It didn\u2019t look very humane to me.\u201d \u201cHe was tied down with a hood over his head. Terrorists around the world and Isis, when they execute people, that\u2019s what they do.\u201d Last year, Ed Pilkington spoke with Deborah Denno, a Fordham University professor who specialises in execution methods: Denno has studied the history of the firing squad in the US, and found that in most of the cases in which it was used it was relatively quick and effective. In 1938, a \u201chuman experimentation\u201d was carried out on a 42-year-old inmate who was executed by firing squad, with his heart monitored using electrocardiograph tracing. The results showed that his heart was electrically \u201csilent\u201d within a matter of 20 seconds. The only known case of a botched execution by firing squad, in 1951 in Utah, appears to have been an act of vengeance on the part of five trained marksmen pulling the trigger. They targeted the wrong side of the prisoner\u2019s chest, apparently intentionally, and he bled to death. Are there other options? Tennessee, which last executed someone in 2009, is considering bringing back the electric chair, though its death row inmates have sued. Oklahoma, too, is looking to the electric chair, which it is only allowed to use if lethal injection is found unconstitutional. Last year, after Clayton Lockett\u2019s botched execution, the corrections department and a history museum were in disagreement over who, exactly, owned Old Sparky. Oklahoma also joins Missouri in exploring the return of the gas chamber, which has a rather gruesome track record of its own. A 1992 New York Times article recounted the death of Eugene Harding as he lay there \u201cgasping, shuddering and desperately making obscene gestures with both strapped-down hands\u201d, a death so drawn out it led Arizona to switch from the gas chamber to lethal injection. Compare that with the scene in Arizona last summer, when Joseph Wood took one hour and 58 minutes to die by lethal injection. \u201cI saw a man who was supposed to be dead, coughing \u2013 or choking, possibly even gasping for air,\u201d wrote one witness. A top American judge has recently called the decision to move from traditional methods such as the firing squad, electric chair, gas chamber and hanging to lethal injection a mistake. \u201cSubverting medicines meant to heal the human body to the opposite purpose was an enterprise doomed to failure,\u201d Alex Kozinski wrote. Why don\u2019t we just stop executing people? Ending the death penalty would be the easiest way to solve the problem, yes. And several states have enacted de facto moratoria in the last few years. Public support for the death penalty was at its highest in the late 1990s, when 80% of Americans said they favoured the execution of convicted murderers. (That\u2019s also when actual executions neared their highest.) By 2013, support had declined to about 60% in Gallup\u2019s annual survey, and the results remained unchanged last year, even after three lengthy botched executions made headlines. What happens now? In Utah, there are currently eight prisoners on death row, but no executions scheduled for the next two years. So while the governor made headlines for signing the law on Monday, it won\u2019t actually be putting anyone in front of that new firing squad for a while. All eyes are currently on the US supreme court, which in April will hear a lethal injection challenge brought by four death row inmates in Oklahoma, one of whom has already been executed. The inmates are challenging the use of a sedative called midazolam, which was used in all three of last year\u2019s botched executions. Justice Sonia Sotomayor has said she is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the botched midazolam executions. \u201cIt is true that we give deference to the district courts. But at some point we must question their findings of fact, unless we are to abdicate our role of ensuring that no clear error has been committed,\u201d she wrote, a week before the court agreed to hear what amounts to the most high-profile challenge to American executions in decades. If they rule against the continued use of midazolam, it\u2019s likely Utah won\u2019t be the last state to revisit the use of the firing squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
