Peter Tobin is to be interviewed by murder detectives about the unsolved case of Vicky Hamilton, who was last seen alive in 1991. Convicted sex attacker Tobin was found guilty on Friday of raping and murdering Kluk, 23, at the Glasgow Catholic church where she stayed last summer, then dumping her body under the floor. Police described the killing as one of the most savage they had ever dealt with. New evidence has revealed that Tobin, now aged 60, used to live in Bathgate, West Lothian, from where 15-year-old Vicky vanished while waiting to board a bus back to her home near Falkirk. Last November the case was reopened as a murder investigation as detectives began poring over the initial 7,000 interviews, 4,000 statements and 12,000 documents from one of Scotland's biggest ever missing person inquiries. They hope advances in DNA techniques will provide a vital clue to the identity of her killer. A black leather purse found close to Edinburgh's St Andrew Square bus station 11 days after she went missing has also been undergoing fresh analysis. 'When you get someone like Peter Tobin convicted, there is going to be interest in what else they might have done,' said a police source yesterday. Tobin, who was sentenced to a life term of at least 21 years at the High Court in Edinburgh on Friday, has previous convictions for a sex attack against two young girls while he was living in Havant, Hampshire. Prayers will be said throughout Glasgow today for Kluk and the Catholic parish torn apart by the scandals surrounding her death. The community around the city's St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is still reeling from a catalogue of revelations involving adultery, alcoholism and sex abuse, with their own parish priest at the centre of the scandal. Work continues to repair the fabric of the church, torn apart by police investigating the murder, and there are plans to reconsecrate the building in a bid to aid the spiritual healing process of a community trying to pick up the pieces of broken hearts and smashed reputations. Kluk was a bright, ambitious student with dreams of making a better life for herself by paying her way through university with a series of summer jobs. Despite speaking four languages, the intelligent and articulate woman found she could earn more in a day working as a cleaner in Glasgow city centre than she could in a month back home. Her family thought she would be safe living in the home of a priest, among a community of the same Catholic faith in which she had been baptised. It was while working at St Patrick's Church that Kluk first met Tobin. In a crime so savage that it shocked even the most experienced murder detectives, he went on to bind, rape, stab and bludgeon her to death before dumping her body under the church floor and going on the run. It was only when detectives began investigating Kluk's murder that details of the secret double life she had been leading began to emerge. Soon after arriving in Britain last June, Kluk had embarked on an adulterous relationship with married chauffeur Martin Macaskill, 40, with the full knowledge of his wife, who described their marriage as an open one. It was Macaskill who raised the alarm when Kluk disappeared and sparked the nationwide manhunt which resulted in Tobin being arrested in London and led to a salacious six-week trial at the High Court In Edinburgh. Details of her affair with Macaskill and a friendship with a married sheriff who taught her golf and enjoyed a hug with her the night before she died were openly dissected in court, along with her unusual relationship with parish priest Father Gerry Nugent. 'It was like she was killed twice; first when she was murdered, then when her reputation was destroyed,' said her father, Wladyslaw, after the court case. Kluk was not the only one to have her reputation attacked. Nugent was portrayed as a drunk, a liar and a womaniser after the 63-year-old self-confessed alcoholic claimed to have had a 'lengthy and intimate relationship' with Kluk and an adulterous affair with another parishioner. With his reputation as a pious pillar of the community facing ruin, he was sacked two weeks before the trial began by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Mario Conti, for failing to live up the standards expected of a priest. Nugent told the court he had supplied Kluk with a \u00a31,500 laptop computer and given her the use of his credit card after he claimed she had initiated an intimate relationship with him. The priest, who is facing contempt of court charges later this month in relation to the case, has since admitted previous sexual relationships with members of his congregation and of taking prostitutes back to the church. After the trial, Conti issued a public apology on behalf of the Catholic Church over the conduct of the disgraced parish priest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
