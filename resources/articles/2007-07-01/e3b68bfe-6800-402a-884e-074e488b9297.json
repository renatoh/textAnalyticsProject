Despite the unresolved issue of Tevez's ownership, United are hopeful of securing the services of the 23-year-old Argentinian within the next seven days, smoothing the way for him to make his debut in a friendly against the Italian champions Internazionale on August 1. West Ham continue to be infuriated by United's public statements about the \u00a330m-rated forward, and the Premier League is determined to ensure that any fee paid by the Premiership champions goes directly to the east London club. That does not sit happily with Media Sports Investments, the company which owns Tevez's economic rights despite West Ham's unilateral decision in April to break their agreement with MSI about Tevez. United are frustrated by the delays in their attempt to sign him but expect the deal to be concluded even if it drags on towards the end of the transfer window on August 31. However, at this stage United's chief executive, David Gill, anticipates a swift conclusion. \"We are working on it but it is complicated and maybe overcomplicated, in my humble opinion,\" Gill said. \"We are having to deal with four parties - the player, West Ham, the companies that own Carlos's economic rights and the Premier League - in an effort to sort everything out. \"The process is ongoing as we speak, but Carlos will fly in to undergo his medical and we will take it from there. We still have to sort out the paperwork but we are confident that can be achieved in the course of the next week or so.\" The United future of Tevez's Argentina team-mate Gabriel Heinze appears uncertain, with the manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, saying that the defender's agent is \"adamant\" that Heinze wishes to leave Old Trafford. Liverpool are keen to buy him but United do not want to sell to their bitter rivals. Heinze may need to exercise his right to buy out the final two years of his contract, at a cost of \u00a36.8m, to secure a move to Anfield. United launch their four-game tour of the Far East today when they face the J-League champions Urawa Red Diamonds in Saitama. Owen Hargreaves is expected to make his United debut but his fellow new signing Nani has an ankle injury and the midfielder Ji-Sung Park will be out until January after knee surgery. In Nani's absence Ryan Giggs will play. The 33-year-old says he is unfazed by the threat to his first-team position from the Portuguese 20-year-old: \"Whether we had signed anyone or not, the challenge is always there to perform. If you don't you won't play, but that's the same for every player and if I don't play well I won't play.\" The midfielder Kieran Richardson yesterday completed his move from United to Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old, who has eight England caps, signed a four-year deal after a medical. Sunderland's manager, Roy Keane, played alongside Richardson at Old Trafford and said: \"I'm delighted that we've been able to bring Kieran to Sunderland. Having worked with him in the past I'm well aware of what a good player and a good lad he is. He's ready for a fresh challenge and hopefully Sunderland will provide that for him.\" Richardson, who spent 2004-05 on loan at West Bromwich Albion, helping them in their last-gasp escape from relegation, said: \"It's an exciting move for me. I know all about Roy Keane and I'm looking forward to playing for his team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
