The door stays open all day. People come and go for food, coffee and conversation. The tradition continued after Jeff, 58, was diagnosed with cancer in 2009. Even with chemotherapy and the medical bills racking up, the Foxes found reasons to celebrate. This year, those reasons include their son\u2019s transfer from an air force base in South Korea to one in Germany and, they hope, out of harm\u2019s way. Last year, the reasons to celebrate included the election of Donald Trump. Both registered Republicans, neither Fox had started as a huge fan of the Manhattan real-estate developer. Jeff supported Carly Fiorina in the sprawling Republican primary contest, and Denise, 54, admired Ben Carson, a fellow evangelical Christian. Their votes mattered a lot because the Foxes live in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether county that voted twice for Barack Obama before backing Trump. The area is home to many ageing Democrats whose family politics were forged from the unionized ranks of Bethlehem Steel, once the region\u2019s economic juggernaut, or in the formerly vibrant clothing mills and slate quarries around the Foxes\u2019 home in Pen Argyl. Almost all of that economic activity is gone, with scant signs of replacement. Some residents now make a long commute to work in one of the new warehouses along the I-78 corridor. Others have sold and moved away. There\u2019s a sense of waiting for something new to happen, and then waiting some more. By his description, Fox took the Trump plunge out of a conviction that politics as usual was irreversibly broken. We have voted with our principle and our conscience for all these years, and where has it gotten us? It\u2019s time to vote to shake things up. As the anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, Fox sat in his dining room and reflected on how that decision had played out. He lamented what he said was a decline in civil discourse surrounding politics and intensifying media malpractice. He was not thrilled with tax legislation the president was preparing to sign. He said his personal economic prospects had not improved. And he said the president should \u201ckeep his hands off the tweet button, just take the high road and govern\u201d. But like many bedrock Republican voters across the country, Fox ultimately stood behind Trump, pointing to economic growth, restricted immigration and what he said were other improvements in American life under the president. Fox also thought Trump was providing a service by subverting politics as usual. \u201cIt can be fun to watch \u2013 politicians attack Trump, Trump attacks the politicians and the media, it\u2019s like a circus, in a way it\u2019s like \u2018Give me some popcorn,\u2019 you know what I mean,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily see it as a bad thing. It\u2019s bringing some things to light. Maybe, is that what we needed, to kind of shake things up and stir the pot a little it? Maybe, who knows.\u201d The Guardian has been interviewing Trump supporters in Northampton County over the last year to determine whether Trump is living up to his promise, in the eyes of his supporters. Fox, who switched his registration from Republican to Independent during the election out of disgust with what he felt had become poisonous partisanship, rejected the premise of the question, explaining that his last-minute support for Trump was not motivated by pie-in-the-sky hopes of what Trump might deliver so much as it was driven by a dearth of options. Trump is not important to me. The direction or the philosophy is more important than the person. It\u2019s not the hill I would want to die on, if you want to put it that way.\u201d If the election came around again tomorrow, Fox said, he might be lured away from Trump by the right candidate \u2013 but certainly not by the likes of Hillary Clinton. \u201cGiven the same two candidates and the same scenario, I would vote the same way.\u201d \u2018We lost all of our stuff to China\u2019 Trump appears to be in political danger. Despite a surging stock market, a flood of new jobs and a humming economic growth rate, the president\u2019s approval rating has been stuck in the mid- to upper-30s since May. That\u2019s probably at least 10 points short of where it needs to be for Trump to be re-elected, according to postwar precedent for incumbents. That\u2019s if Trump makes it to 2020. While it\u2019s a longshot that the special counsel investigation into links between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign would dislodge the president from office, the likelihood of impeachment hearings would increase were Democrats to grab control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. That possibility drew closer with the victory of Democrat Doug Jones in a special Senate election in Alabama, and with a weakening in support for Republican candidates nationally. On a generic ballot, Democrats appear to have opened an 11-point advantage over Republicans, according to NBC News/Wall Street Journal polling from December. The shift was palpable on a recent afternoon inside Detzi\u2019s Tavern in Wind Gap, Pennsylvania, where a cup of \u201chousemade Italian wedding\u201d soup costs $3.50 and the draft special was $2 pints of Michelob Ultra. Inside at a big table were seven women, all former colleagues at Bangor Blouse Company, a mill that had closed for good in 1988 after, one explained, \u201cwe lost all of our stuff to China\u201d. They were catching up and wrapping gifts for the holidays, but when the talk turned to politics, only one would speak up in favor of Trump, in an area where the Republican presidential candidate had dominated. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk to me about it because they\u2019re all for Hillary,\u201d said the woman, who declined to give her name because \u201cI don\u2019t want to be crucified.\u201d \u201cMost of the blouse mills were Democrats,\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause I used to go to all of the Democratic rallies and everything. Because they were for the unions. And the people. They were for us.\u201d But only Trump would confront the threat of immigration, she said. \u201cAll these illegals in, and they\u2019re putting us out. They don\u2019t care about the Americans any more.\u201d Another woman at the table, Carla DiBernardo, 71, said the 2016 presidential election had represented a tragic missed opportunity \u2013 but not for Hillary Clinton. \u201cDid you see they had Joe Biden on The View?\u201d DiBernardo asked. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s a wonderful person. He should have been president. And I was thinking how different it would be, if he had run.\u201d \u201cHe speaks so professionally,\u201d her friend agreed. Everyone at the table thought Biden could have won \u2013 and for that matter could win next time. The big disagreement at lunch, however, was over sexual harassment allegations against the president: \u201cIsn\u2019t this womanizer thing crazy?\u201d \u201cNo. It\u2019s about time women get the power back. I\u2019m sorry but \u2013\u201d \u201cGet their power back? They never had it. They were always tossed under the chair.\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d \u2018Santa\u2019s firearms workshop\u2019 The imposing slopes of the Blue Mountain ridge at the top of Northampton County, which is traced by the Appalachian Trail, held snow cover after it had melted elsewhere. People wore gloves outside to smoke. Traffic from the big industrial parks and distribution centers seemed to pick up with a seasonal intensity. There were other signs of the season. At the side of one highway, a digital billboard for a gun shop featured a picture of Santa Claus holding a semiautomatic rifle. The caption: \u201cSanta\u2019s firearms workshop.\u201d A local newspaper had published a letter protesting against the billboard, drawing responses that ranged from dismissive to caustic. \u201cDid you move here from NJ or the city?\u201d asked one. \u201cStop trying to impose your views on the public.\u201d As much as it is a national bellwether, the Lehigh Valley is also a place with a deep sense of local identity and a pride built in part on generational memories of blast furnaces that used to glow orange through the night. Fox\u2019s grandfather worked at Bethlehem Steel, as an accountant. Fox\u2019s last job, before he got cancer, was as a salesman at the furniture chain Raymour &amp; Flanigan. One of his daughters has worked for a decade at Walmart. \u201cThe only debt we have is healthcare debt,\u201d said Fox, who receives social security and disability payments. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked our way out of everything else. It\u2019s amazing what we do with what we get. \u201cIt would be nice for me to say, I got $40,000 of medical bills, so it\u2019d be nice if someone paid them for me. Some would say, \u2018It\u2019d be nice, the easy way.\u2019 But it\u2019s real. \u201cIt\u2019s not the responsibility of the government to pay the bills.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
