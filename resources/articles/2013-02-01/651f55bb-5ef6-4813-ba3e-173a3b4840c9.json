Rodgers is a firm admirer of the France international, who has made no secret of his desire to play for Paris Saint-Germain. Ben Arfa did not push for a move in the January transfer window, as he recovers from a hamstring injury, but Newcastle's resolve to keep the player is likely to be tested at the end of the season. The 25-year-old has a contract at Newcastle to the summer of 2015 and would command a sizeable fee. Ben Arfa is older than all the signings Liverpool have made since Rodgers became manager and Newcastle's asking price could prove an obstacle, but their interest in re-signing Carroll could work to the Anfield club's advantage and an exchange deal. West Ham United have an option to buy Carroll at the end of his season-long loan but Liverpool dropped their demand for a guaranteed move to remove the \u00a335m striker from their wage bill in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
