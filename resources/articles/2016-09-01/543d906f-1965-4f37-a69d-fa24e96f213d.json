She is both helped and hindered by her unflagging sunniness: whether a song calls for the hiccupy sweetness that is her vocal calling card, or clawing intensity, it\u2019s always underscored by her innate optimism. This makes for a very agreeable summer cocktail \u2013 aptly, it was originally scheduled for a June release \u2013 but comes up short if you prefer breeziness to be sometimes clouded by messier emotions. No matter the subject \u2013 from her preferred male body type in the acid-jazzy Skinny to agonising relationship uncertainty on the 60s-funk Gorgeous \u2013 Bizu\u2019s tone is permanently fizzy. That ebullience goes to an interesting place on White Tiger\u2019s Regina Spektorish quirkiness; but elsewhere, when Bizu sings the line \u201cThere\u2019s glass on the kitchen floor\u201d, echoing a line from Winehouse\u2019s You Know I\u2019m No Good, it just affirms that she\u2019s no Winehouse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
