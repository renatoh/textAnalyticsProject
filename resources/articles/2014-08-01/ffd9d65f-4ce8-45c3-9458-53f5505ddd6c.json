Carl\u2019s terror-stricken, almost-grimace has to be up there, right?\u201d You have to feel for poor Carl. A year or so ago, Arsenal tried to be subtle, asking him to design a \u201climited edition\u201d baseball hat \u2013 revealed at the \u201cspectacular launch event\u201d for the club\u2019s new away kit, and to be given away \u201cfree\u201d with each order submitted in the first two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more subtle than your traditional cap and I think it would appeal to people my age. It was fun and I\u2019m quite proud to have my own hat. I\u2019m going to try and get hold of one myself!\u201d he said. The free careers advice was spurned, and he remained in situ, so has now been sent to spend a season with Sam Allardyce. Perhaps this time, the message will be appreciated. Another player transferred against his will was Jaap Stam, one minute picking the marble top for his island, the next, testing positive for nandralone. But, in between times, he was also packed off from Manchester United to Lazio, for a variety of compelling reasons: he had mildly needled his manager in a book; he had affectionately mocked his team-mates in a book; the 35-year-old Laurent Blanc was suddenly and inexplicably available; the plc needed paying back following the signings of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. So it was that Stam was forced to Rome, and at the press conference where things were made official, he sat glaring, gaping and gulping, his enormous frame squashed into a Lazio jersey that went exceptionally badly with his suit trousers. A different Dutchman was less than amused to arrive at United, Jordi Cruyff scowling at his introductory photocall. Common wisdom states that he did not want to leave Barcelona, though it\u2019s also possible that he simply disapproved of Alex Ferguson\u2019s blazer-shirt-tie-slacks combo. More recently, Emmanuel Frimpong exhibited the attitude that has endeared him to all when moving from Arsenal to Barnsley, David Goodwillie did not look especially impressed when leaving Blackburn for Aberdeen this summer, Robinho was decidedly unamused at leaving Real Madrid for Manchester City, and Shaquille Coulthirst did not appear to find the English Riviera to his taste. Other notable underwhelmees include Bradley Orr, Fabio Da Silva and Nicolas Anelka. On signing for the Baggies, he displayed his new shirt as though it were made of asbestos and last been worn by the smelly kid. Others who left clubs when they might rather have stayed include Roy Race, departing Melchester for Walford in the summer of 1983, following a boardroom row, and Johnny \u201cthe Hard Man\u201d Dexter. During Danefield United\u2019s summer tour of Europe in 1985, Dexter lost his place in the team to Bobby Williams, and, given his age and temper, the only side interested in signing him were Burnside Athletic, who had finished bottom of the fourth division in three of the previous four seasons. This was not at all well received, but Dexter led them to promotion, before joining Melchester, its squad decimated after the Basran carbomb disaster. And lastly for this section, an expression of disgust that, while not quite answering the question, deserves to be immortalised in these pages nonetheless: Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, enjoying the arrival at the Bernab\u00e9u of Julien Faubert. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG \u201cNorwich City recently suffered the ignominy of claiming they\u2019d beaten Serie D side Saint-Christophe Vall\u00e9e d\u2019Aoste 13-0 in a pre-season fixture, only to be pulled up by Saint-Christophe Vall\u00e9e d\u2019Aoste, who advised them that the team they had played was in fact a selection of non-professionals from their surrounding region, somewhat taking the glaze off the emphatic victory,\u201d reports Michael Crompton. \u201cTo cover my fellow Canaries\u2019 blushes, are there any similar tales of mistaken identity for us to take comfort from?\u201d Yes, Norwich were scheduled to play Novara, a team from Italy\u2019s Serie C \u2013 but the game was cancelled. So, in order to avoid the fate suffered by Leeds, forced to play among themselves when Romania\u2019s Viitorul Constanta didn\u2019t turn up, new opposition were sought. Unfortunately, they were not who they were thought to be, forcing the following official statement, its importance underlined by the use of a capital \u201cC\u201d for \u201cClub\u201d: \u201cIn our original match report for this warm-up fixture, acting in good faith on the basis of information given to the Club, we incorrectly reported that we had played against local club side SC Vallee d\u2019Aoste\u201d, it read. \u201cIn fact the game was against an Aosta regional select side and we are happy to put the record straight and apologise to SC Vallee d\u2019Aoste and their fans for the misunderstanding. The game was convened at very short notice following the late cancellation of our previously scheduled match against Novara.\u201d Conspicuous by its absence was an explanation as to quite how this all came to pass, the space where one might have expected to find it instead full of guff, of all the things. \u201cThe hospitality shown to Norwich City Football Club by the people in Saint-Vincent and the surrounding area has been excellent and our training camp there has seen the squad continue to build their fitness levels, as we gear up for our three forthcoming friendlies against top-flight European opposition in the shape of SC Bastia, OGC Nice and Celta Vigo.\u201d Meanwhile, Alun Thomas emails in thusly: \u201cOxbarn Social Club, a Sunday League side from Wolverhampton, went on a pre-internet pre-season trip to Germany in 1973. They\u2019d written to the mayor of Mainz hoping to arrange a match against suitable opposition. Somewhere, wires got crossed and Oxbarn got mixed up with Wolves, who\u2019d just finished fifth in Division One. A match against third-tier SVW Mainz resulted with queues at the turnstiles and the opposition apparently on \u00a380 a man win bonus. Oxbarn lost 21-0.\u201d The Birmingham Mail has more on the tale and caught up with John Shorthouse, who played at full-back that day. \u201cI think we got the ball into their half twice,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBy the end the crowd cheered every time we touched it. To be fair, the German players didn\u2019t celebrate after the 14th goal. But they didn\u2019t go easy, they were having none of that.\u201d Oxbarn would have gain some revenge at the post-match reception, mind. \u201cWe all got rolling drunk \u2013 our keeper was sick on the coach going back \u2013 but they were in an even worse state because they weren\u2019t used to alcohol,\u201d said Shorthouse. \u201cWe definitely won the drinking game!\u201d And here\u2019s Peter Goldstein: \u201cIn 2004 the national team of El Salvador visited Zimbabwe, and drew 0-0 with a local side in Harare. The problem: it wasn\u2019t really the national side. It was a select XI chosen from clubs in El Salvador that passed itself off as the national side. When the Zimbabweans found out that the Salvadorans, as the papers put it, \u2018le hab\u00edan vendido gato por liebre\u2019 (literally \u2018had sold them cat instead of hare\u2019), the squad literally fled the country before the second scheduled friendly. Incidentally, one of the Salvadoran papers noted it was a shame the second game had been cancelled, because Bob Marley had once appeared at that stadium. Spanish speakers who want more of the wonderful gory details should google \u2018Caso Zimbabue\u2019 Salvador\u2019.\u201d Tangentially, and in other select side anecdotes, the Knowledge and many of its equally unpleasant acquaintances once found itself in the crowd when Watford travelled to Israel in the summer 1998. Though the trip was principally for the purpose of quenching thirst at Tel Aviv\u2019s Bar International, it was cunningly disguised as a close-season friendly against a combined Petah Tikva team. Graham Taylor, in his second spell as manager of the Hornets, appeared to be somewhat surprised when regaled extensively and at volume for his achievements while manager of England. Ten years later, Lithuania turned up in the Czech Republic, to help their hosts warm up for the European Championships. But local officials had confused their stag destinations, thinking that they\u2019d invited Latvia, and as such the match programme advertised as much. But even after that, the error wasn\u2019t spotted \u2013 lining up prior to kick-off, the Lithuanian players were regaled with the Latvian national anthem. Both men responsible for the amusement left their posts, you will no doubt be relieved to learn. And finally, one final case of mistaken identity, straight out of a comic book: that of twin brothers, Srdjan and Zvezdan Cebinac. In 1965, both went on trial at FC K\u00f6ln. Zvezdan impressed, so the club decided to sign him, but instead, accidentally offered terms to Srdjan, who gratefully pounced upon them. He played just three games prior to being booted off to Sittardia, while his brother, known as Zick-Zack, eventually signed for N\u00fcrnberg, and was also capped 20 times by Yugoslavia. REPEAT BANISHMENTS \u201cHas there ever been another footballer banned for the start of two consecutive seasons?\u201d asks Sam Bailey. \u201cOf these, is there anyone else whose ban stems from their committing the exact same offense two seasons in a row?\u201d As far as the first part of the question goes, of course there has, and of course it was Eric Cantona. He actually missed the first four games of 1993-94 with injury, and then, before the following pre-season, had even started, attracted controversy \u2013 in America to commentate on the World Cup, he was banned from so doing following an altercation with a technician. A few weeks later, Manchester United travelled to Glasgow, where they were to play in a tournament also featuring Newcastle, Rangers and Sampdoria, evidently not put off the British Isles despite David Batty\u2019s efforts in the summer of 1992. They began with a 1-1 draw against Newcastle, Cantona scoring their goal \u2013 but lost 6-5 on penalties. So, the following day, and with Sean Connery in attendance, they met Rangers, eliminated by Sampdoria, and moments before half-time, David May fittingly marked the start of his auspicious United career with an accomplished own goal. Cantona had started the game on the bench, but replaced Dion Dublin after the break, and quickly established a row with Steven Pressley, earning himself a booking on 81 minutes for walking away from the referee, Andrew Waddell. Then, a minute later, a lunge at the aforementioned \u2013 more matter-of-principle than violent, accordingly avoided with a light skip \u2013 resulted in a red card. Already suspended for the start of United\u2019s European campaign, after being sent off post-match against Galatasaray the previous season, he would also now miss the first three league games. But Alex Ferguson was sanguine: \u201cAs far as I am aware walking away from a referee is not a bookable offence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Eric feels there has been an injustice he has to correct it. He can\u2019t control his temper in such a situation. But I\u2019m still delighted to have him and we will have to live with his faults.\u201d However, the Independent\u2019s James Traynor was less forgiving. \u201cIt will continue to be a costly existence,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut one wonders how long United, who start their campaign at home to Queen\u2019s Park Rangers, can \u2013 or should \u2013 tolerate Cantona\u2019s fragile temperament. Also, there should be no disguising the fact that United were playing in an unimportant pre-season match and one of their best players was dismissed because he could not cope with a 21-year-old, Pressley, who cannot hold down a regular place in Rangers\u2019 first team. Ferguson\u2019s Mon Genius is becoming an increasingly costly luxury.\u201d Then, in January, Cantona became frustrated by the continual foul play of Crystal Palace\u2019s Richard Shaw, flicking out a leg in protest. For this, he was dismissed, and on his way off, subjected to abuse from fan Matthew Simmons. Understandably, he saw no reason as to why he should tolerate such behaviour, remonstrating in stern terms \u2013 but the FA felt differently. They and United cut a deal \u2013 United would suspend Cantona until the end of the season \u2013 but the FA reneged, extending the ban until the start of October. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cHave any footballers ever been honoured for their off-the-field bravery?\u201d asked John Bennett in 2009. We received a deluge of responses to John\u2019s question, each outlining footballers who have received awards for their heroism during the first world war, enough to highlight just a small selection of them in a Knowledge special. Here is an excerpt: Bernard Vann (Northampton Town and Derby County): Vann signed as an amateur for Northampton as an 18-year-old in 1905, joining his brother Albert at the club, and made a handful of appearances before switching to Derby in 1907, again as an amateur. In 1908 he made his only three appearances for the Rams, playing against Aston Villa, Notts County and Birmingham before leaving the Football League behind to attend Cambridge University and then begin a career as a chaplain and teacher. After joining the army at the outbreak of the first world war, Vann rose swiftly up the military ranks and won the Military Cross during the Battle of Loos in 1915, a battle in which Albert was killed. His won the Victoria Cross in 1918 after the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, during which \u201che led his battalion with great skill across the Canal du Nord through a very thick fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns\u201d. Unfortunately Vann\u2019s VC was a posthumous one \u2013 in October of the same year he was shot through the heart by a sniper\u2019s bullet. The full heroic story is here. You can read the full article here, and for thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive. CAN YOU HELP? \u201cHas any other football team played 11 trialists like Hereford United did?\u201d poses Steve Hodges. \u201cWhat is the lowest number of players that started the first match of a new season which started the final game of the season before?\u201d muses Daniel Snowden. \u201cMy club, FC Porto, hired a new manager this season \u2013 Spain\u2019s Julen Lopetegui,\u201d begins Alan Gomes. \u201cHe has hired 11 new players, five of which come from his native Spain: \u00c1ndres Fernandez, Oscar Torres, Adri\u00e1n Fernandez, Christian Tello, Jose \u00c1ngel. It makes sense that Lopetegui would hire so many of his countrymen - his previous job was as Spain\u2019s U19 and U21 coach. Still, I\u2019m wondering: what\u2019s the highest number of new recruits from his own country brought in by an incoming foreign manager? And what were the results?\u201d \u201cRuediger Mielke played only 15 games in the Bundesliga for MSV Duisburg in 1964-65 and 1965-66, but managed to score 15 goals in those games,\u201d writes Graham Clayton. \u201cIs there another player who has played more top-flight games with a 1:1 goals to games ratio?\u201d \u201cPortsmouth\u2019s new kit has names of fallen soldiers on it. Are there other examples of clubs recognising war victims on their kit?\u201d tweets Simon Cook. \u2022 Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
