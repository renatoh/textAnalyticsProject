But is the country Ukraine or \"the\" Ukraine? The Collins dictionary, to which Guardian journalists are instructed to turn for guidance, says: \"Ukraine, the\". We only turn to Collins, however, when there is no relevant entry in the Guardian stylebook. In this case there is and it is very clear. It says: \"Ukraine, no 'the'.\" Every time we break this rule and refer to \"the Ukraine\" we get objections. A Ukrainian reader writes: \"When will you finally stop using the offensive expression 'the Ukraine'? The correct name of the country is 'Ukraine'.\" On another occasion the same reader complained that use of \"the Ukraine\" was \"patronising and colonial\". On August 5 I put the following note in the daily corrections and clarifications column: \"The republic is Ukraine, not 'the Ukraine'.\" The \"the\" had been attached to it in an article in the Guardian's Saturday supplement Jobs &amp; Money, where it said: \"Internet fraudsters from Russia, the Ukraine and the Baltic states were arrested in Britain by the hi-tech crime unit ...\" The Ukraine correction brought a protest from a reader, who wrote: \"I was rather irritated today to read the 853rd (approximately) grovel in the corrections and clarifications column for having followed perfectly normal English usage in writing 'the Ukraine'. Somebody (or bodies) seems to find this usage of the definite article offensive ... I can only wonder who the fuck is whining ...\" I replied: \"The Guardian stylebook says no 'the'. We follow the stylebook. The name of the country is not the Ukraine. It is Ukraine. The 'the' for Ukrainians has echoes of imperial and soviet dependence.\" To make my own position clear: I am with the stylebook on this. A historical note, courtesy of Collins, may be useful: \"Ukraine ... ruled by the Khazars (7th-9th centuries), by Rurik princes until the Mongol conquest in the 13th century, then by Lithuania, by Poland, and by Russia; one of the four original republics that formed the Soviet Union in 1922, unilaterally declared independence in 1990 which was recognised in 1991.\" Mikhail Heller and Aleksandr Nekrich in their book Utopia in Power, A History of the USSR from 1917 to the Present (Hutchinson), offer this explanation for the \"the\": \"We know that there has been a historical hostility to the very idea of a separate Ukrainian nationality. Moscow's goal was to eliminate Ukraine and Ukrainians as political and cultural entities. Soviet translators, who knew the patterns for country names in English, deliberately translated the name of this area with the article 'the' because it then sounds to English-speakers like a part of a country rather than the name of an individual, independent country. \"Ukrainians who understood why Soviets were using the article 'the' complained. In Russian, obviously, the word 'Ukraina' has no article. Since the Soviet Union broke apart, Ukrainians have been pushing very hard to have the article 'the' removed from the English translation, so as to be linguistically correct, ie to show that Ukraine is a separate, independent country, not part of another country.\" The Oxford English Dictionary, in its definition of Ukrainian, points out that the word ukraina means border, frontier or marches, with connotations of edge or brink. Nekrich and Heller are quoted in a website debate on the \"the\" in country names (www.ezboard.com) where the extract, above, brought this response: \"This is just silly ... The Ukrainians, understandably want to have an English name that sounds like a 'real' country, but the distortion of history in the service of nationalist pride is deplorable.\" The official website of Ukraine in its English language version refers to the country throughout as Ukraine. Even Nina Krushcheva, the granddaughter of Nikita Krushchev, referred to Ukraine as Ukraine, in a controversial article in which she asked: \"Does Ukraine have a history? Well, the place certainly does, but is the place a country? ... It is more of a frontier than a region, let alone a country ...\" (www.project-syndicate.org and search for Krushcheva). Earlier this year the Guardian's stringer (freelance correspondent) in Berlin in a note on the struggle taking place in Ukraine to assert Ukrainian names in place of Russian, concluded: \"Also it's 'Ukraine' (a country), not 'the Ukraine' (a region of Russia).\" Just so. \u00b7 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 0845 451 9589 (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or +44 (0)20 7713 4736 between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.
