Sources in the leave-voting town said Tice\u2019s candidacy would be announced in Hartlepool later on Thursday. The multimillionaire property tycoon, who was elected as an MEP for the party in May, founded the Leave Means Leave and Leave.EU campaigns. Hartlepool has long been considered one of the Brexit party\u2019s most winnable seats in next month\u2019s general election, after it took joint control of the local council in September. A Brexit party spokesman declined to comment. However, well-placed sources locally confirmed the news. The town voted 69.3% to leave the EU three years ago and there is little sign that opinion has softened. According to estimates by the academic Chris Hanretty, it returned a higher Brexit party vote than any other Labour seat in May\u2019s European parliamentary elections. But Tice\u2019s candidacy has also raised eyebrows locally, as the Brexit party had already publicly announced its election candidate as Ken Hodcroft, the former Hartlepool FC chairman. The local Labour party, which is fighting to keep hold of a seat it has held for 56 years, said the Brexit party had decided to \u201cdump a millionaire with at least some links to the town and replace him with a multimillionaire who has none\u201d. Jonathan Brash, a local Labour party official, said: \u201cHartlepool doesn\u2019t need southern elites \u2026 being parachuted into our town to tell us what to do. He doesn\u2019t live here, he\u2019s barely even visited Hartlepool. \u201cWhat does Richard Tice know about Hartlepool and challenges facing local residents? What does he know about child poverty, the devastating impact of public service cuts, what it\u2019s like to live in communities where there are too few police officers and too few jobs? \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know our town, he doesn\u2019t know our history, he doesn\u2019t know our people and they will not accept being used for this cheap political stunt. Hartlepool needs an MP that puts people before privilege, who puts Hartlepool first.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
