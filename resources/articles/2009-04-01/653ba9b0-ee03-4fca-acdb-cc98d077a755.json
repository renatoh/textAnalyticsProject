These games are always special.\" This one was astounding. Chelsea left a deflated Merseyside in a state of agonised introspection, the visitors' 3-1 win having potentially had profound implications even for Liverpool's domestic title challenge. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side had been sweeping all before them, but their aura has been lost with the manager's game-plan wrecked by Guus Hiddink's clever use of Michael Essien as a midfield shield, and by the visitors' unexpected sense of adventure even when the game was 1-1. The London side retained a sense of perspective yesterday, insisting the tie was not yet over, though, privately, it will be hard for minds to not drift to the prospect of Barcelona in the semi-finals. There is a statistical quirk that suggests a first European Cup beckons in west London. In each season since 2002, the team that has beaten the side who had, in turn, eliminated Real Madrid has gone on to claim the trophy. Last year Real were eliminated by Roma, who in turn exited to the eventual winners, Manchester United. This time around, Chelsea are on the verge of knocking out Liverpool whose dismissal of the Spaniards had hinted at better than Wednesday's traumas. The only concern still nagging at Hiddink's charges is the reality that Bar\u00e7a, so irresistible against Bayern Munich at Camp Nou, may block their passage to Rome. \"I don't know if Barcelona will be too worried about anyone, the way they're playing, but if we can carry on playing like that we will put fear into a lot of teams,\" said Frank Lampard. \"But we have to keep playing to those standards. There was just a feeling about the game at Anfield. We were very organised and played good football and, on the break, we were very dangerous. We changed ourselves tactically a little bit and they found it hard to deal with. Essien was as key as anybody in securing the win. His was a very important performance for the team. He and Michael Ballack played together and I was allowed to go more advanced up the field. \"It worked really well as a threesome. I think both Michaels and the back four were great. But it's strange. You would have taken 3-1 all day long before the game, but there was actually a slight sense of disappointment that we didn't score more, especially when they opened up and we had two or three good chances to make it four or five. That would have put the tie out of sight. At the moment it isn't. Liverpool are a strong team and they beat United 4-1 away, so we have to be on our game to make sure we don't slip up. But it was fantastic to get that result.\" Given the psychological damage that has been inflicted on Liverpool's confidence, the sense persists that momentum may even have swung back to Chelsea in pursuit of United in the Premier League . \"Who knows what can happen in the league, FA Cup and the Champions League?\" added Lampard. \"Everything is still up for grabs. Even though we're still behind in the league it's important we keep to the standards we set at Liverpool. When we play to those standards, when we look at the strength we've got throughout the pitch, we are as good as anybody. We've just got to play to that high standard all the time. We have been doing that in recent weeks and at Liverpool we did everything right except maybe get those two extra goals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
