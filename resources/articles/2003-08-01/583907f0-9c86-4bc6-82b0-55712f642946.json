Under normal circumstances the cup for girls of 13 and 14 would probably already have been engraved with the name of Valentine Fauviau, a gifted player with a promising future. But her sporting career may already be over, buried beneath a scandal that last week saw her father arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. This weekend, competitors of all ages were defying the 40C heat to play on the dozen open-air clay courts next to a row of barrack-style indoor stadiums. But over the picnic lunch of cold beer and barbecued sausages, and against the noise of express trains 200 yards away speeding off towards Spain, the after-match talk was of fellow club member Colonel Christophe Fauviau, 43, who allegedly poisoned opponents likely to beat his older, and less gifted, child, Maxime, 16. The allegation is that Fauviau, a tough, retired military man, added tranquillisers to the water bottles of Maxime's opponents, a ploy which went horribly wrong when one drugged rival, Alexandre Lagard\u00e8re, fell asleep at the wheel of his car after abandoning a match at the end of the first set because of drowsiness. Lagard\u00e8re was killed in the ensuing crash. Only several months of investigation by an examining magistrate and a court hearing will decide whether Fauviau should go straight to the top of the infamous list of tyrannical fathers ready to go to almost any lengths to see their children succeed on the tennis court. The charge is that it was his over whelming ambition for his children that led to Maxime winning the tournament against Lagard\u00e8re, a 25-year-old primary schoolteacher, and another a week later after two other players turned in sub-standard performances. According to Renaud Lahitete, the lawyer representing the Landes-Basque tennis league, Fauviau was arrested while waiting for his daughter to fly back from a competition in Egypt and is being questioned about the death of Lagard\u00e8re in June. Traces of a prescribed tranquilliser, Temesta, were later found in his body. Another player beaten by Maxime was hospitalised for two days, also from Temesta poisoning. But the most important evidence has been the allegation by an opponent who claimed he saw Fauviau senior tampering with water bottles in the clubhouse. The player put his own water to one side for analysis, the lawyer said, and it was found to contain Temesta. Lahitete declined to confirm reports that several other cases of spiked water bottles were being studied and that Fauviau had admitted the offences. 'I don't think it prejudges the colonel's case to say he is a stubborn man, convinced that officialdom was getting in the way of his children's future,' one of Maxime's school friends, Angelina Mollard, said. 'He couldn't accept that Maxime was just a nice boy and not much more than an average regional player. You could see the colonel had spent years in a strictly disciplined environment. This stiff attitude didn't make him very popular with young people.' Regional tennis coach Fran\u00e7ois Duport said club members were particularly shocked because the alleged poisoning had taken place during a minor friendly tournament in which the first prize was a ham. Lagard\u00e8re, a modest, well-liked official at Dax, had recently applied for umpire status and was thought good enough to referee Grand Slam tournaments. By general consensus, Fauviau's attitude off-court resembled that of the father of international champions Serena and Venus Williams, who obstinately kept control of his daughters' careers, establishing his own disciplinary and training programme. Fauviau did not so much bully his children as 'glower at them from the stands', according to one member, and was not given to the sort of unsporting behaviour that led to bans against the fathers of two international champions, Mary Pierce and Jelena Dokic, because of parental off-court aggression, and to the jailing of domineering Peter Graf, sentenced for tax frauds linked to the Grand Slam earnings of his daughter, Steffi. The Dax club coach, Herv\u00e9 Musialek, said Fauviau's daughter Valentine, already a junior international, did not need to be intimidated by her father to win. 'But you can't help wondering if she will reach such a high level in an adult environment without her father present to encourage her and protect her from the viciousness of highly motivated players. I haven't heard anything to suggest she might give up, but she will need an extraordinary character to appear in public stadiums when this affair will be recalled every time she goes on court.' French national sports institute paediatrician, Fran\u00e7oise Fraisse, an expert on ambitious parents in tennis, swimming and ice-skating, said: 'Ambitious parents guide their children into individual rather than team sports where they can be permanently present - you see that any day on television. When tthe children fail to reach high standards, parents turn on officials and blame them for poor training facilities or inadequate coaching. But from there to taking the law into their hands ... that's another story. The real danger when parents get too involved is that the child will reject both the sport and the parent when they want to show their independence in adolescence.' Valentine's success could have been crucial to the reputation of her home village of Tercis-les-Bains whose spa, the centre of a minimal tourist industry, has been shut down following an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease, putting most of the villagers out of work. The Fauviaus' small family house was shuttered and the telephone went unanswered this weekend. Neighbours were reluctant to talk about 'the colonel', who settled in the village after a restless army life. At the Dax club, where his children used to practise several days a week, Fauviau was recognised as a good, average player and there was speculation that in encouraging his children he was making up for having let his own tennis hopes slip by. But the odds of manufacturing a champion, even at junior level, are astronomical, according to sportswriter Bernard Lefort, who rated Valentine as having a fair chance of reaching Grand Slam status, but added chillingly, 'if there are no psychological repercussions from this scandal'. 'To get to the top you have to fight your way through packed ranks of other contenders with pushy mums and dads,' he said. 'There are more than a million registered tennis players in France, 20 times more than in 1970, during which time the number of clubs has risen to 9,000. Competition is incredibly fierce. 'Selection and preparation are ruthless, which explains why there are nearly always one or two senior French players in the world top 10 and why France does so well in the Davis Cup. But the last authentic French male champion was Yannick Noah 20 years ago, and he doesn't fit into the pattern of abusive parental control.' Jacques Dupr\u00e9, chairman of the Landes-Basque tennis league, recalled battling with the colonel. 'Valentine was quickly seen as a real hope at a national level and we wanted her to be included in a training scheme at Toulouse, well away from her father's pressure,' he said. 'Her father said no, so we had to think up other ideas to meet his demands. 'But there was no way we could agree to the permanent presence of her father who had no experience as a coach. Eventually he accepted a special arrangement with a private Paris sporting academy where she receives 16 hours of coaching a week.' It also seems likely that sponsorship by Adidas, which wanted a say in Valentine's appearance programme, played a part in the agreement. Whether the absence of his daughter contributed to the colonel's decision to give his less gifted son an illegal helping hand has yet to be proved in court. And the inhabitants of Dax itself, where there is a disproportionate number of old people, are poorly informed, with the local paper, Sud Ouest, playing down the story and not naming those involved. As the world's media, from the United States to Japan, tramples Dax's flower beds, trying to uncover its secrets, the big events this week, as far as the tourist office is concerned, are guided visits to the benevolent Saint Vincent's birthplace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
