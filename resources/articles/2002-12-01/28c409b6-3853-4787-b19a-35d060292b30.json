Leighton, who is deputy chairman of the plc board and played a major part in the summer sacking of David O'Leary, said results under Terry Venables are having a detrimental effect on the entire club both on and off the field. \"We've been a club divided, in a strange way, and I don't know how that's happened,\" Leighton said yesterday. \"We've had the fans versus the manager versus the directors versus the chairman. There have been rumours of people not getting on on the playing side and that's bad. \"The only way you get out of these situations is by grinding your way out of it. There's no magic, no wand and it doesn't suddenly come right. You work for your luck.\" Leighton, who has instructed the chairman Peter Ridsdale to focus on reducing the club's \u00a370m debts, said: \"The only person who can determine whether he has lived up to expectations is Terry. It's his own expectations which matter. You don't suddenly become a bad manager overnight. Are the results disappointing? Yes they are, because we're flirting with relegation. \"But the issue is that there is this thing across the whole club at the moment. There is a lack of confidence. We've a good squad of players but because we're not performing on the pitch we're not performing off it and, therefore, does everyone in the club feel under pressure? \"Yes, they do and rightly so because the measure of everything is performance. You can't get away from it. Performance is everything on and off the pitch and at the moment we are not performing.\" The club's 3-0 win over Bolton on Monday night might bring the club out of their recent malaise, he says. \"That win was a start but the question now is whether we can string some results together. We need to. \"Football's like any other sport, any other business, in that when your confidence goes you have got a problem. Clearly the players are vital in this because they are the product, they perform on the pitch, they get you the points or they don't. \"But it's a club thing. The club has lost a lot of its confidence. I thought it was very interesting at Bolton, you could visibly see everybody's confidence rise when Danny Mills scored [their first goal]. Suddenly this was a different team.\" Leighton, who is also chairman of Royal Mail and British Home Stores, says Leeds' failure to reach the Champions League last season cost them \u00a320m and that failing to qualify for Europe altogether this time round is unthinkable. He added: \"We started out this season thinking that we mustn't miss out on Europe. Now our first task is avoiding relegation and unless we think of it like that we won't achieve our first objective. \"European football is very important because that is where the money is, because that is where the television is. \"We have a squad and payment system which is there to provide Champions League football. We haven't got Champions League football and that is why we have got to cut our cloth accordingly. We can't spend money we haven't got.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
