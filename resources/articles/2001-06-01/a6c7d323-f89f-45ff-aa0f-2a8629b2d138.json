Ball had asked the club to treble his salary to \u00a325,000-a-week but the club's board, who have debts of over \u00a325m, refused to go above \u00a318,000 and will meet on Wednesday to confirm Ball's availability. Liverpool, Celtic and Blackburn Rovers are all expected to make bids if the 21-year-old, who has two years left on his current contract, does not back down. The club have already transfer-listed Francis Jeffers who could be on his way to Newcastle United for \u00a38m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
