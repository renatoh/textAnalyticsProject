In this definitive account of the great admiral, Vincent leaves us in no doubt as to the devastating forces unleashed in any sea battle (\"boys became blotches of stained matter against a mast\"). After so many close calls, Nelson's luck ran out at Trafalgar. \"England expects that every man will do his duty\" and \"Kiss me, Hardy\" have entered the national psyche, but they also reveal Nelson's theatricality. \"His instinct for keeping control of the stories told about him was uncannily present,\" says Vincent, \"even in the extended scene of his death.\" Shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize, this comprehensive narrative would not disappoint the admiral. Arbella: England's Lost Queen, by Sarah Gristwood (Bantam, \u00a38.99) Lady Arbella Stuart, a niece of Mary Queen of Scots, was kept in close captivity for most of her life - first by her cousin Elizabeth I, then by James I - lest she marry, reproduce and found a dynasty. Her letters reveal a clever, bookish young woman constantly hoping for \"a small and ordinary liberty\". At the age of 35, against James's wishes, she secretly married one William Seymour, but the king quickly separated them. Arbella had to fake illness and dress as a man to escape from her captors in a last-ditch attempt to be reunited with her husband; her daring flight is vividly re-imagined at the start of this lovingly crafted biography. In the end Arbella was caught, though William got away. She was imprisoned in the Tower where, broken-spirited, she starved herself to death. Tantalisingly, one of her tutors might have been Christopher Marlowe in disguise, and it is thought that her tragic life inspired Webster's The Duchess of Malfi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
