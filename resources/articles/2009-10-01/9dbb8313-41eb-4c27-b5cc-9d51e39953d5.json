The monarch has seen a \u00a3500m boost to her estate \u2013 which is now worth \u00a36.5bn \u2013 and is pressing ahead with major redevelopment schemes through the recession in the hope of building longer-term success. While her property manager, the Crown Estate, has ticked up an 8.3% increase over the past six months, the widely-used Investment Property Databank (IPD) index remains down 3.5%. Roger Bright, chief executive of the Crown Estate, whose portfolio includes Windsor Great Park and Ascot race course, said: \"Overall values have gone down over the last 18 months, but ours have held up better than many others. This is because of the diversified nature of the portfolio, which includes agricultural land and the marine estate as well as commercial property.\" The Crown Estate announced this summer that the overall portfolio had dropped by 18% to \u00a36bn year-on-year, the first fall in value for 15 years, but now it is saying it is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the future. In the past six months there has been an upward movement in the portfolio's value helped by a big increase in the value of farm land and by demand for the seabed estate due to renewable energy operators setting up wind turbines offshore. Nick Nabarro, senior manager at IPD, said the picture for the property market remained uncertain. \"Without a doubt some portfolios have performed significantly better, but the average for the last six months remains 3.5% down,\" he said. \"High-quality assets are being actively pursued by foreign investors.\" The wider commercial property side of the Crown Estate portfolio is continuing to dip slightly but Bright says that the value of prime properties \"has more or less stabilised\". Rental revenues remain under pressure in London's West End as businesses continue to shed staff in the recession and Bright was unwilling to predict when this trend might end, but he was \"cautiously optimistic\" for the business as a whole, which returned more than \u00a3220m to the Treasury in the last financial year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
