They have come to South Africa from temperatures of minus 15 degrees. For nine months of the year, cricket pitches are snowbound. Their players collectively fly 160,000km for a team practice, and the side consists largely of expatriates from the Asian subcontinent and the West Indies. Their match winner against Bangladesh, Austin Codrington, is from Jamaica, dreadlocks and all; their highest scorer here in Cape Town, Ian Billcliffe, is a teacher from New Zealand with experience of first-class cricket. The weather has certainly been the biggest obstacle to the game taking shape within the indigenous population, even though the first recorded international match, which was played against the United States, took place as long ago as 1844. And their progression was hindered before the World Cup by the dismissal of their coach, Jeff Thomas, who has now returned to his native Australia. Thomas has decided to sue the Canadian Cricket Association after being replaced at the end of last year by Gus Logie, the West Indian who has had proven success as a coach in the Caribbean. Although the International Cricket Council ratified the appointment of Thomas, it was not responsible for funding his salary and had no control over his dismissal. Officials in Canada claim that Thomas never signed a contract and therefore has no legal comeback. Meanwhile, Logie, who played in the outstanding West Indies XI of the 1980s, and Karam Jopaulsingh, the manager, have instilled sufficient vigour in the team to compete in this tournament. At one stage after winning the toss, Canada were 143 for 3 with 12 overs still remaining. Billcliffe, who has a first class century in New Zealand to his name, added 86 in 27 overs with Joseph Harris, the captain. He was very well held when Hoicking to leg in attempting to improve the run rate. The inexperienced fielding of countries such as Canada was emphasised in the closing overs of their innings. When Billcliffe went in the 42nd over, having struck eight fours and two sixes, there was no one of sufficient ability left to contend with the medium pace of Thomas Odoyo, who proved as economical and niggardly at the end of his second spell as he had in his first, when he bowled Ishwar Maraj. The novelty of these two countries, coupled with the policy of the United Cricket Board of South Africa of giving tickets for free to children from the black and coloured communities, ensured that around 6,000 spectators had come to Newlands by the end of the first innings. Every fixture here in the group stages is a day-night affair, although the necessity for that, given that this match attracted this far from a full house, was unclear. In reply Kenya's openers got off to a comfortable start as the floodlights came on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
