You must be joking", "bodyText": "Poor Colin Montgomerie. He can't win, even when he does, as he did at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show last night. Coach of the year 2010, we must now call him \u2013 though not with a straight face, presumably. To point out the absurdity of Monty's newest designation is not necessarily to besmirch the man himself. He is articulate and, if you can get past the quirks, occasionally engaging. More than anything, though, he is an identifiable \"celebrity\" who can be relied on to stand up in front of 12,000 people, and a national television audience, and not make a fool of himself or the occasion. Presumably this is why he was named coach of the year. Because there can't be any other reasons. Not sensible ones, anyway. You don't have to be a self-loathing golf correspondent of a national newspaper to point this out. You simply have to know something about golf and the Ryder Cup. If you do know something about golf then you will know it is the most selfishly individual sport of all; that a team figurehead in anything other than an administrative sense is about as much use as an antique diving helmet. And if you know anything about the Ryder Cup you will know the title of \"captain\" carries about as much weight as a punch in the guts from Gyles Brandreth. Bad captains win Ryder Cups, great captains lose them. It's the players, stupid. Monty, like all Ryder Cup captains in the modern era, turned up for the photo opportunities and Hoovered up the lucrative sponsorship opportunities. He supposedly picked the uniforms (though we might assume his wife, Gaynor, had a significant input), he sorted out the hotel accommodation (though we might assume a European Tour lackey or six had a significant input) and he delivered a speech at the opening ceremony (though I'm guessing he might have had some help with drafting it). Did he \"coach\" the winning 2010 European Ryder Cup team in any way that might fit any serious definition of coaching? Did he, for instance, sort out any kinks he might have seen in Graeme McDowell's swing? Did he spot early in the 2010 season that Francesco and Edoardo Molinari were potential Ryder Cup winners and then help them fulfil that potential? Did he stick with his reported instincts when it came to his wild-card picks and choose Paul Casey in the face of opposition from his vice-captains? The answer to all of the above is no. So what exactly did \"coach\" Montgomerie do to deserve the honour bestowed on him by a panel of distinguished national newspaper sports editors? Well, he fronted a series of press conferences during Ryder Cup week which ran high on entertainment value and low on insight (\"The only thing that matters is 14 and a half points\") and irony (\"The Ryder Cup is not about me. It never has been about me'). He made his American counterpart, Corey Pavin, seem very dull, although admittedly that wasn't hard to do. And he didn't send his players out into torrential rain in waterproof suits that weren't waterproof. Unlike Pavin. The pairings and the singles line-up were put out in Montgomerie's name but we can safely assume his phalanx of vice-captains, and the players themselves, had a huge input. The gossip suggests he gave some good speeches in the team room during the week. By virtue of his own Ryder Cup record as a player, he commanded a degree of respect from his squad for the duration. And, lest anyone forget, he did win. Victory is never to be underestimated. But in the context of an event such as the Ryder Cup, does Montgomerie's marginal contribution over the course of a wet weekend in Wales deserve to be honoured with the title coach of the year? Was he really more deserving than Andy Flower, who has done a solid and sustained job of coaching the England cricket squad, or even Ian Holloway at Blackpool? One suspects even Montgomerie knows that answer to that one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
