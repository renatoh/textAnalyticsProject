Essex, starting this round in third place, also have five wins but on a slow, reliable wicket the leaders yesterday set about batting their promotion rivals out of the game. Southgate is the most genteel of London outgrounds, the shires transplanted to the city with church spire, marquees and thick trees. The accent is more Range Rover than Bow Bells, proper beer flows in the clubhouse, and a barbecue sizzles at deep midwicket. Essex are more at home in harsher climes, at Ilford or Southend. In Southgate they seem to have less chirrup, as if they feel they are playing in church, and even their appeals sound apologetic. They stuck to their task well enough, but the left-arm spinner Tim Phillips's three for 85 off 20 overs was their best return and that summed up their day. Andrew Strauss went early, after which Sven Koenig and Ben Hutton assembled the day's core partnership. It was sedate but efficient, and Hutton at one point remained runless for 31 deliveries. But as he neared his half-century he decided he was seeing the ball well and launched four sixes in the last 28 runs of his 65. Koenig's turn to freeze came when he reached 90, the next 10 runs taking 80 minutes. He should not have made it to his century, as on 99 he pulled Jon Dakin hard to Aftab Habib at square leg and scrambled a single while the fielder groped for the catch. Owais Shah operates with more swagger, and his 60 took 69 balls, brisk in context. Meanwhile Ashley Cowan decided that the way to deal with the Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq was to bowl bouncers. As they sailed harmlessly over the batsman's helmet, in one case swirling on for four byes, the umpire John Holder just about lost patience no-balling the bowler. But the Razzaq danger was soon neutralised when Phillips trapped him in his crease. The evening brought runs for Paul Weekes as he and David Nash figured in an unbroken stand of 66 to ensure the fourth batting point. \u00b7 Ireland will host the 2005 ICC Trophy, the tournament of 12 non-Test playing countries that will also serve as a qualifier for the World Cup finals in the West Indies two years later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
