Of the 25 originally named in the squad to face Nigeria in Aberdeen tonight, only six have scored for their country. But Vogts, in charge for his second game following the 5-0 thrashing at the hands of France last month, insisted that finding the back of the net was not just the responsibility of his strikers. \"It is not just a problem that the strikers have not scored many - it's a problem for the whole team, said Vogts, a former coach of Germany. \"We have to get forward more from every position. We have to ask how many goals come from the midfielders and look to that.\" Vogts will give four players their debuts and hand a first cap to at least one other. Celtic goalkeeper Rob Douglas, Middlesbrough's former England Under-21 international Robbie Stockdale, Kevin McNaughton of Aberdeen and Nottingham Forest captain Gareth Williams will all be on from the start. Sweden, who are in England's World Cup group, have called up their Under-21 goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson of Djurgarden for their friendly with Norway in Oslo. He will act as cover for FC Copenhagen's Magnus Kihlstedt who will replace Magnus Hedman. Coventry's Hedman flew back to England yesterday after his one-year-old son was taken to hospital with inflammation of a brain membrane. With Argentina's striking problems exacerbated by an injury to Gabriel Batistuta, Claudio Caniggia is likely to make his third appearance under Marcelo Bielsa in tonight's game against Germany in Stuttgart. The veteran Rangers striker looks set to fill the gap created by the loss of Batistuta, who was knocked unconscious in a collision with Parma defender Fabio Cannavaro during the Serie A match against Parma on Sunday, despite the fact that Barcelona's Javier Saviola has been called into the squad. Caniggia should join Lazio's Claudio Lopez and Valencia's Kily Gonzalez in Bielsa's attacking triumvirate. Scotland (4-1-3-2): Douglas (Celtic); Stockdale (Middlesbrough), Weir (Everton), Dailly (West Ham), Crainey (Celtic); Williams (Nottingham Forest); McNaughton (Aberdeen), Lambert (Celtic), Gemmill (Everton); McCann (Rangers), Thompson (Dundee United). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
