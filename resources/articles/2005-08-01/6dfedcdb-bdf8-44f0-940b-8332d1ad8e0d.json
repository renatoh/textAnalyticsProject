The report found that the 100 biggest UK companies paid out \u00a339bn in dividends to shareholders last year - almost four times more than the \u00a310.5bn they paid into their final salary pension schemes during the same period. The stock market recovery helped bail them out and, as a result, the combined deficit of FTSE 100 company pension schemes has fallen from \u00a342bn a year ago to \u00a337bn. The report, from consulting actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock, warned that the days of shareholders gaining at the expense of pension schemes could be numbered because of new rules that give scheme trustees more power to negotiate higher pension contributions from employers. It predicted there would be confrontation between companies and trustees and said firms with bigger pension shortfalls could also find themselves restricted with regard to the dividends they are able to pay and the capital they can raise. Lane Clark &amp; Peacock estimated that the Footsie, which closed yesterday at 5,363.7, would have to climb above 6700 by this time next year to wipe out the combined FRS 17 deficit of Britain's biggest firms - unless they put in more money. FRS 17 is the pensions accounting rule which requires companies to value future liabilities at current market prices. It named BAE Systems, British Airways, BT, Corus, Exel, Rolls-Royce Group and Royal &amp; SunAlliance as seven companies it said were \"notably exposed\" to stock market falls. All have pension schemes that are bigger than the market values of the companies themselves and also have significant investment holdings in shares. BT topped the shortfall table with a scheme deficit of \u00a35.1bn - equivalent to a third of its stock market value. At present only three companies in the FTSE 100 do not have an FRS 17 deficit: Associated British Foods, chemicals firm Johnson Matthey and insurer Old Mutual. Many firms have made, or are planning to make, sizeable injections of cash into their pension schemes to tackle shortfalls. BT and Royal Bank of Scotland each paid in more than \u00a31bn last year, while Royal &amp; SunAlliance announced a package of measures last month, including a switch to a scheme based on average earnings instead of final salary, that will wipe out a chunk of its deficit, which last year stood at \u00a3683m. The report's findings also suggested that many companies were pinning their hopes on a sustained recovery in the stock market to get them out of a hole. Supermarket group Wm Morrison, for instance, may have watched its own shares take a hammering recently, but its pension fund managers remain confident in the wider stock market: 92% of its pension scheme assets are invested in equities. By contrast, Reuters may spend a lot of time reporting on stock movements, but when it comes to its own UK pension schemes, it has cut the proportion of assets in equities by more than half, from 62% to just 28%. Whatever happens to the markets, it is clear that new scheme funding regulations, which are due to come into effect this autumn, will cause something of an earthquake in the world of company pensions. Scheme trustees will have much more clout in determining appropriate levels of pension contributions. \"The new funding regulations put trustees firmly in the driving seat and may potentially lead to 'robust negotiations' between companies and trustees,\" the report said.
