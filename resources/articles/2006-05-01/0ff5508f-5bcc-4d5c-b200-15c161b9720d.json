It means a studio album from the foursome - Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald - will be released in the Autumn. Take That are reliving their early 90s heyday in a 32-date tour, albeit without Robbie Williams. Songwriting duties are to be shared. \"It's great for us all to be writing together for the first time,\" Owen said. \"We really want to make a great record, the best record we've ever made.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
