The inaugural Olympic water polo Ashes battle promised to be more vicious than any involving leather and willow. Team GB's women went from losing to Russia in their Games debut on Monday evening by a late goal to facing the old enemy in the sport where anything goes. Apart from fisticuffs. Fran Leighton, the British captain, said: \"If I have the ball, short of punching me you can do what you want. But as soon as I drop the ball you have to let go. \"Its all about having the face of an angel above the water while all the fighting goes on underneath. The refs sort of know it goes on.\" Underwater cameras offered the occasional flash of the goings on beneath. But a permanent feed was required to show all the skulduggery that occurred, with broken ribs and fingers and \"chest bruises, shall we say\" all potential occupational hazards, admitted Leighton who as leader and centre-forward is Team GB's Wayne Rooney. Australia won the inaugural gold at the Sydney Games in 2000 when the women's event was finally introduced to Baron de Coubertin's quadrennial pageant. In what proved to be the pattern of the contest, Australia went ahead inside the opening four minutes and were never subsequently threatened. Their opener came from Sophie Smith who was allowed to advance too far by GB before forcing the ball scrappily past Rosie Morris, the home keeper. This was followed by two quick Ash Southern goals \u2013 the first a point blank hurl too powerful for Morris, the second a fizzing hurl into the top left corner. At the close of the quarter GB's Alicia McCormack's had pulled one back. But 3-1 had become 6-2 at the end of the half: Wilcox again for GB, Gemma Beadsworth and Rowie Webster twice for Australia. The Australians raced to 10-1 and illustrated why they are considered favourites to reach the final, while Szilveszter Fekete's GB side can only hope for better in their final group game against Italy on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
