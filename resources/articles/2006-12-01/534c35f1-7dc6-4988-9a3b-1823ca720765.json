Ignore the shoplifting teenagers before chancing upon an unlikely bunch of hastily scrabbling employees (faces screwed against the horror of it all) scratching around for a \u00a35 present of pure tat. I would happily wager that the effort of finding a \u00a35 present far outweighs the cost savings in buying anything so cheap. But what sort of scrooge would dare to interfere with that, ahem, joyful office tradition of Secret Santa? My own experiences have not been good: picking names out of a hat should keep things secret but offices gossip and secrets get broken. Witness the delights of one Christmas to be forgotten: the big boss, an older man, picking out the most junior member of the team and going out and to buy her a sexy top. Inappropriate - and he blew the budget. Personal favourites include the desk tidy I was given by my colleague, who took the opportunity to make a festive point about my stuff encroaching on her space. Although I am guilty of being a bad santa myself: faced with shopping for a middle-aged woman I didn't know very well, I decided on a set of posh jams. Not realizing they were from me she later confided they had gone down a treat - with her elderly aunt, to whom she had given them for Christmas. When it comes to office politics, nothing is harder to navigate than the office Secret Santa, says Janet Davies, author of Darling, you shouldn't have!, a guide to buying gifts. \"Buying gifts for people at work is very difficult. The key thing when buying is how well do you know the person and what message you are giving. In the workplace that's hard because often you don't know the person very well.\" But don't think knowing someone means you can go for something jokey: Claire Stogden, director of human resources at Inspired HR, warns against anything that can be perceived as harassment. \"Secret Santa is meant to be fun, and in most cases, a gift of The Dummies Guide to Email for the technophobe will be received with good humour. There is always the chance, though, that this kind of gift will offend or humiliate, violating the recipient's dignity. Such unwanted behaviour may be perceived as harassment, even if the perpetrator did not intend to cause this,\" she says. \"Employers have responsibilities under health and safety and discrimination legislation to prevent harassment. They also have a duty of care to meet employee's expectations under the psychological contract. Secret Santa could be a breeding ground for harassment, and employers need to consider their position .\" Oh dear. So, if you don't fancy a lawsuit for your ill-thought-out purchase, you might be best playing Scrooge and bah humbug-ing your way through it. \"Don't feel pressurised into taking part\" says Rasheed Ogunlaru, a life and business coach. \"Even though you're in a work context you don't necessarily have to play ball.\" And if you need an excuse you could always claim it's the money: \"If cash is an issue, and it often is over Christmas, then politely and warmly let colleagues know that you won't be taking part. It's not going to help your happiness at work or home if you get into debt,\" he says. And if you're not comfortable with that, here's a guide to buying for colleagues. Safe presents Indulgent food, such as chocolates or festive treats, can be good for most people. But anyone who thinks food is the easy option has clearly never bought nut clusters for a person with a nut allergy, sweets made with gelatine for a vegetarian, biscuits for a diabetic or wine for a teetotaller. Keep an eye on them in the canteen. Books are often an easy way out, providing you steer clear of anything from the self-help section (How to Be a Good Boss will not go down well). Diet books should never be given to anyone as a present, ever - but cookbooks always go down well. For women, a bit of high street sparkle is always a winner - remember to check whether she wears earrings before buying those chandeliers. Or a house plant for home or the office works for either sex, without being uncomfortably personal or a complete copout. Jolly it up with a Christmas decoration or two. Dangerous presents There are three gift categories to avoid, says Lorraine Loughlin at the London Gift Consultancy. They are the inappropriate, the well-intended but hurtful and the \"meant to be funny\". Janet Davies agrees: \"Anything from Ann Summers is not appropriate for the workplace.\" This is the case even if you know the person really well. You may have watched strippers together on a night out, but back in an office environment even a pair of furry handcuffs can cause offence. Nor should you ever buy presents to address a problem. Buying deodorant for the guy in the office with BO is not a good, or sensitive, way to address the problem. \"Even gag gift certificates such as 'The World's Worst Coworker' and 'Bastard Boss of the Year' can be rude and de-motivating,\" says Loughlin. Another category that should be on her list to avoid is the gift that suggests there is nothing of interest about you whatsoever. This includes scented candles, soap, bath salts and above all, pot pourri (as if you would). And if you hate your gift? \"In a work environment it's best to be as polite as possible,\" says Angela Marshall, an image consultant. \"Just say: 'Thank you, I appreciate the kind thought' and leave it at that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
