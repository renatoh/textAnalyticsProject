Although Wenger feels that Wilshere is almost back to his best after completing 90 minutes against Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup and Bate Borisov in the Europa League, the manager does not want the 25-year-old to endure a setback after his recovery from a broken leg. \u201cIf the competition was less ferocious, he is ready to play,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be scared to play him. In the Premier League he can play [soon]. He is nearly back to his best.\u201d Wenger responded to speculation that Wilshere, who spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, will need to move in January in order to earn a place in England\u2019s World Cup squad by saying that he will have opportunities at Arsenal. However, Wilshere has not played in the Premier League since April and Wenger knows it will be necessary to adopt a cautious approach with a player whose combative performance against Borisov showed he remains unlikely to shy away from physical confrontations in midfield. \u201cIt is part of his game,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cYou cannot ask a guy not to go into any contact. I believe it is his strength. His strength is to turn the game forward and have acceleration individually or with the ball. Sometimes when he accelerates individually he pushes the ball too far and gets confronted.\u201d Wenger insisted Mesut \u00d6zil remained an important member of his squad despite indicating Arsenal could look to cash in on the Germany international in January. \u00d6zil is in the final year of his contract and although he is set to return for Saturday\u2019s trip to Watford after recovering from a knee injury, Arsenal have done well without him in recent weeks. \u201cI genuinely think he wants to stay,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut I am always positive about that. Of course he is important. But I have many players \u2013 we spoke about Jack, we spoke about Iwobi. They are all players who play in this similar position and it is very interesting because it gives me a lot of opportunities to keep them all focused and refreshed. \u201cPeople go quickly to conclusions. Last year we played the last 11 games and won 10. We beat Man City in the FA Cup semi-finals and Chelsea in the final and he played as well. You can always find the example. But it\u2019s true that we have done well recently. \u201cWe live in the world where people have opinions and sometimes they are right and sometimes they are not always proven right on the longer period. You need players who have quality and \u00d6zil is one of the best players in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
