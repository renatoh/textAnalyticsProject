I give her healthy meals and plenty of treats but it doesn't seem enough. She always wants more. I know she has been taking biscuits from the kitchen, eating them in her room and hiding the wrappers under her bed. If I ask her if she has taken the biscuits, she always denies it. Her father \u2013 from whom I am separated \u2013 has long struggled with his weight. He is often on strict diets yet lets our daughter eat whatever she likes when she is with him. I worry that I have been too strict \u2013 I restrict her to one or two biscuits rather than leave her with the whole packet, so maybe she hasn't learned when to stop. She isn't overweight but my mother recently said that she will have to watch herself because she could easily become so. I don't want my daughter to associate eating with guilt and to eat in secret. M, via email The first thing to do is take her to a GP to make sure there is no underlying health problem. I don't expect there is, but it's something to mention. Naturally, you will need to couch things diplomatically and I might be tempted to talk to the GP alone first, to see if they even think it's necessary to get your daughter in. You say she's not overweight, so there really isn't a problem yet (I'm guessing that, like 90% of parental worries, it's not about what is happening but fear of what will happen if things continue unchecked). It sounds as if she eats healthily and has treats in moderation. What about exercise? If your daughter leads a healthy lifestyle then a few biscuits are not going to hurt her. I do wonder if this is more about you, and your husband. Are you worried she's going to become overweight like him? Is this a battle more with the way he parents than your daughter's eating habits? Does she remind you of him and does she sense that? Has she started eating secretly since you split up? Have you spoken to your husband about it and asked him to have healthy snacks in the house? I'm sorry if this seems like a lot of questions when you want answers but these are important things to think about. The way to give your child an unhealthy relationship with food is to layer food with emotion and focus too much on it. If you find biscuits have gone, don't ask her about them. The fact that she is lying to you suggests she feels ashamed. In fact, if you are worried about this, try keeping biscuits in the house only occasionally, if at all. I'd also like you to shift the focus of your relationship with your daughter away from food. Food is a big part of everyday life and it should not be imbued with battle and shame. Have you tried cooking or baking with her? This is a great way to learn about nutrition, and you can control the ingredients. It's also useful mother-child time, which might be helpful here. Do you trust your daughter in other ways? If she feels her choices are not listened to or respected, then she won't trust herself, either. Buy her The Silver Spoon for Children: Favourite Italian Recipes by Amanda Grant, \u00a312.95, and let her choose what to make \u2013 say one meal a week. Put her in control. Unlike some cookery books aimed at children, this one teaches you how to make proper food, rather than stuff in the shape of smiley faces. We are born with excellent appetite control but it is conditioned out of some of us. I totally appreciate that you don't want your daughter to have unhealthy eating habits or become obese. But my hunch is that something else is going on here. If your daughter is genuinely hungry, I'd look at what you're making. Does it have the right balance of good fats/proteins/carbohydrates? A carb-heavy meal, especially if it's refined carbohydrates, may make her feel full quickly but then very hungry again a short while later. Ultimately, try to relax, give your daughter plenty of time to talk to you in case something is bothering her and reassure her that she is lovely, safe and secure.
