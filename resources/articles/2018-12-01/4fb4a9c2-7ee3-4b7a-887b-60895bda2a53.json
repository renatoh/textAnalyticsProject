The Coalition\u2019s two-party-preferred vote of 45% to Labor\u2019s 55% in the Newspoll confirms a sustained slump at the end of the last parliamentary sitting fortnight of 2018 and is in line with the 46-54 deficit in last week\u2019s Essential poll. Monday\u2019s result is the first time a government has trailed by 10 points for three consecutive polls since Julia Gillard\u2019s last three Newspolls before she was replaced by Kevin Rudd in 2013. Scott Morrison has signalled that the government still intends to return to parliament in February before a 2 April budget and May election, although the size of voter backlash has New South Wales Liberals eager for the federal government to face the music before its March poll and Labor believes Morrison may go early to avoid parliamentary chaos in the new year. The final Newspoll of the year shows the Coalition\u2019s primary vote at 35% and Labor on 41%. The two-party-preferred vote of 45-55 would equate to the loss of 21 seats for the Coalition and see Labor comfortably elected to majority government if replicated in 2019. In the fortnight since the last Newspoll the Coalition was rocked by the defection of the Liberal MP Julia Banks to the crossbench, and consumed by an internal battle about the MP Craig Kelly\u2019s preselection. But despite multiple threats of parliamentary upsets the government was able to head off a potential referral of Peter Dutton to the high court, prevented a lower house vote on a bill to transfer asylum seekers off Manus Island and Nauru, and passed its encryption legislation without opposition amendment. Approval ratings for both leaders dropped after the chaotic final week of parliament, with Morrison\u2019s rating now in negative territory after his satisfaction dropped a point to 42% and dissatisfaction rose three points to 45%. Bill Shorten\u2019s approval rating also fell by a point, to 36%, although he closed the gap on Morrison as preferred prime minister, up two points to trail 36% to Morrison\u2019s 44% (down two). The poll also revealed that 24% of voters believe the Coalition will win the next election, while a majority \u2013 55% \u2013 expect Labor will win government in the new year. Despite losing more than 30 Newspolls and 80 Guardian Essential polls in a row, Malcolm Turnbull was able to recover the government\u2019s position to a 49-51 deficit for four consecutive Newspolls in July and August before he was dumped by the Liberal party room. In eight Newspolls since the leadership change the Coalition has not polled above 47%. On Sunday Morrison told reporters in Sydney there was \u201cno change\u201d to his intention for the government to deliver the budget on 2 April before a May election: \u201cThat\u2019s what I said. [There is] no change to my position.\u201d Next week the government will release the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook , expected to show Australia\u2019s budget is just short of balance in 2018-19 but on track for surplus next year. Morrison said he was \u201clooking forward to people seeing how well the government has continued to manage the nation\u2019s finances and why it is only the Liberal and Nationals you can trust to run a strong economy\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
