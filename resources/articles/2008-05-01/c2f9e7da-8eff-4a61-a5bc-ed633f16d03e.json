Jones is writing, producing, and directing the film; he will also star. During his presentation, the actor turned his back on his audience to look at a still of the boat that will feature in the film. For several minutes, it was as if he had disappeared into his own maritime reverie: \"This is the bow. The stainless steel work you see on the bow is a replica of what the Weaver boat company put on all of their boats. There is a new transom on the back. The wheelhouse you can see up above.\" Sadly, film distributors don't seem quite as keen on boats as Jones. While his back was turned, many scurried out of the room. Still, once you got past the nautical detail, this began to look like a fascinating project. Jones plans to use San Juan, Puerto Rico, to stand in for 1930s Havana, and the project has the blessing of the Hemingway family. It's a passion project for its star, who first read Islands in the Stream when he was a teenager. The film is about Thomas Hudson, a painter with more than a passing resemblance to Papa Hemingway - a man with a complicated family life who gets into various manly scrapes while chugging round the ocean. One of Hudson's ex-wives, a movie star, turns up. \"If you want to pick a type, she's a Carole Lombard,\" Jones explains. \"In the screenplay, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the world and so that is who I want to cast ... if she is available.\" Let's just hope Jones, and whoever ends up playing his wife, aren't upstaged by a boat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
