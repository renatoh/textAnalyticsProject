The band hail from Reading, and have all the ingredients of perfect cultdom. Little is known about them, a mystery compounded by that bizarre name (\"I think it may have something to do with a film that was never released,\" says their press officer. \"They're very cagey\"). Then there's a considerable musical elusiveness. On their first EP, Hardware, they sounded like a psychedelic goth band. On their second, the daft Panzer Attack, they seemed to be paying unlikely tribute to Hawkwind. But this didn't stop their third single, Let's Kill Music, which doesn't sound like anybody else at all, entering the charts at number 41. Since then, there has been an increasing murmur: \"Who are these people?\" Like any good cult, the CTC are attracting a sizable mixture of the curious, the disaffected and the obsessive. Visually, the band's appeal is obvious: they have a real gang look (apparently they were school friends), along with some of the best haircuts in rock. In particular, keyboardist/guitarist Tom Bellamy has Rod Stewart's vintage blond bouffant, but has dragged it backwards through a hedge. In pop cultdom, these details matter. As they chug into action, other elements of the Cooper gospel gradually fall into place. The sound is charged up, but also given to flights into beauty. It's as if they have taken two conflicting 1970s youth cults and smashed them together: singer Ben Gautrey is a vitriolic complainer in the punk/Johnny Rotten mould, while the music owes much to hippie space-rock. They even use a VCS3 synthesizer (also favoured by Tangerine Dream and Hawkwind), which looks like a telephone exchange and sounds like a UFO. Twenty-five years ago, the CTC would have played gigs at Stonehenge. Today, they share a record label with Westlife, which is nothing short of a miracle. There's something about the CTC's demented conviction - typified in the awesome, rampant electrical charge of Let's Kill Music - that will leave anybody wanting more. Following these people is probably bad for one's health, but I fear there may be a few of us in for the long haul."}, "isHosted": false}}}
