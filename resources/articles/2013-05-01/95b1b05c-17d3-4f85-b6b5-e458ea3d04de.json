A cross-party survey of 150 MPs reveals that 39 (26%) believe there is too much drinking in Westminster. Female MPs are more likely (36%) than males (24%) to see parliament as too alcohol fuelled (36%), while Labour members (31%) are more likely than Tory (20%) or Liberal Democrat (19%) MPs to agree. The charity Alcohol Concern, which commissioned the research, called for changes to the availability of drink in the precincts of the House of Commons, where 13,000 passholders --, including MPs, peers, their staff and journalists in the parliamentary lobby, can drink in its many bars, dining rooms and elsewhere. \"It's surprising that only a quarter of MPs believe there is an unhealthy drinking culture in parliament. If a quarter of employees reported an unhealthy drinking culture in any other organisation it would provoke immediate action by bosses. It's time for parliament to rethink its drinking culture and lead by example\", said Eric Appleby, the charity's chief executive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
