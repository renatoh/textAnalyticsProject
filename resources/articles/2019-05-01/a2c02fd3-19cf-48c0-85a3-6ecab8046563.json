Top stories A factional brawl is set to erupt within the Labor party over concerns the party\u2019s right faction may block Kristina Keneally\u2019s elevation to the frontbench. New leader Anthony Albanese, who has indicated he wants to see more women in senior roles, is understood to have prevailed upon the party\u2019s right faction to include Keneally in the group of MPs it wants in the shadow ministry. But the NSW right, of which Keneally is a member, is blocking her elevation, leading to pressure on South Australian factional powerbroker Don Farrell to make way for the former NSW premier by sacrificing his own position as deputy Senate leader. The brawl is set to come to a head on Thursday, when the party\u2019s factions put forward the names of MPs that will make up Albanese\u2019s new frontbench. Australia is on track to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030 even without new federal energy policies, according to modelling by the energy analysts RepuTex. The analysis, to be released on Wednesday, suggests that a surge in renewable energy driven by state schemes and rooftop solar installations will reduce wholesale prices from $85 per MWh to $70 over the next three years. Lower prices will make gas- and coal-fired power less competitive, even without a market mechanism to make fossil fuels reflect the cost of pollution or a direct constraint on emissions, although a lack of federal policy could lead to longer-term price rises, RepuTex found. House prices should stop falling later this year and could even rise a little in 2020, according to HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham, who says there are now some signs the housing market is starting to stabilise. He pointed to rising auction clearance rates in the major cities and consumer sentiment surveys suggesting households think it\u2019s an increasingly good time to buy a dwelling. \u201cThe housing market is also expected to be supported by cash rate cuts over the coming months, which should see mortgage rates fall, and a recent loosening of prudential settings by the authorities, both of which should support the flow of finance,\u201d he said. HSBC expects house prices to stop falling in the second half of 2019 and pick up in 2020, also supported by first-homebuyer subsidies and rising household incomes. National housing prices have fallen by 8% over the past 18 months, with HSBC forecasting a peak-to-trough decline of about 10%.

Lineups.\u2019 The death toll on Mount Everest has grown to 11 in the past day after an American doctor was killed while descending from the peak. It emerged also that an Australian climber was discovered unconscious but had survived after being transported downhill on the back of a yak. Elia Saikaly, a film-maker, reached Hillary Step, the final stage before the summit, on the morning of 23 May, where he said the sunrise revealed the lifeless body of another climber.

Everything you read in the sensational headlines all played out on our summit night.\u201d This year\u2019s Everest climbing season is so far the fourth deadliest on record, with mountaineers blaming poor weather, inexperienced climbers and a record number of permits issued by the Nepalese government, which, along with a rule that every climber has to be accompanied by a sherpa, led to there being more than 820 people trying to reach the summit. \u201cThere were 200-plus climbers making their way to the summit,\u201d Saikaly told the Guardian of his ascent. \u201cI came across a deceased climber \u2026 that person\u2019s body was fixed to an anchor point between two safety lines and every single person that was climbing towards the summit had to step over that human being.
