Lucho Gonz\u00e1lez's goal gave Porto a 1-0 success over second-placed Maritimo on Saturday to maintain their 100% record. The Argentinian striker won the match with a far-post header after 56 minutes after a cross from the left by the Slovakian defender Marek Cech. Porto already sit three points clear at the top of the table. Chelsea v Rosenborg Tomorrow, 7.45pm Tomorrow's visitors to Stamford Bridge suffered a 2-1 defeat at IK Start, which leaves them fifth in the table, 10 points behind the leaders, Brann Bergen, after 19 matches. The Swedish defender Mikael Dorsin equalised after Start had taken an early lead but Ole Martin Aarst scored the second-half winner. Shakhtar Donetsk v Celtic Tomorrow, 7.45pm Shakhtar won 2-1 at Chernomorets Odessa on Saturday to stretch their lead at the top of the Ukrainian league to six points. Cristiano Lucarelli, with a penalty, and Dmytro Chygrynskiy scored a goal in each half for Celtic's opponents. Rangers v VFB Stuttgart Wednesday, 7.45pm Three second-half goals against Energie Cottbus secured what was only a second victory of the season for Stuttgart. Cacau made the breakthrough in the 53rd minute, heading in from Sami Khedira's cross, and his fellow Brazilian Ewerthon walked in the second with 12 minutes remaining. Mario Gomez wrapped things up when he headed in at the far post for his second goal in three games this season with seven minutes to go. Stuttgart, who visit Ibrox on Wednesday, are ninth in the Bundesliga. Sporting v Manchester United Wednesday, 7.45pm The Lisbon club warmed up for their tie against United with a 2-0 win at Amadora. Striker Liedson put them ahead and Simon Vukcevic scored another. It was Sporting's third win in four league matches this season. Arsenal v Sevilla Wednesday, 7.45pm Sevilla underlined their potential with a 4-1 hammering of Recreativo Huelva last night, in their first La Liga match since the death of wing-back Antonio Puerta. Alexander Kerzhakov put them ahead in the 12th minute and Freddie Kanout\u00e9 doubled their lead before half-time. The former Tottenham striker scored his second after the restart and, though Aitor pulled one back, Kerzhakov added a fourth in the 75th minute, shortly after missing a penalty. Recreativo had Edu Moya sent off before the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
