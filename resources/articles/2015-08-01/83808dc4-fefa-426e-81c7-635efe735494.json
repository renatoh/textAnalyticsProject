Tony Brightwell, 53, who had a private pilot\u2019s licence, cycled to the West Sussex airshow on Saturday to watch the planes and was said by family to be \u201cexcited about seeing one of the last flights of the Vulcan bomber\u201d. Brightwell, a healthcare manager for Sussex Partnership NHS and Brighton and Hove city council, was a regular attender of the show and is the sixth person to be confirmed dead in the disaster, which is believed to have killed 11 people. His fiancee, Lara Ashby, said: \u201cHe was the love of my life, my soulmate and I am devastated that our plans of a life in the sun in a few years\u2019 time won\u2019t now happen. \u201cHe was a kind, loving man who always helped others and just enjoyed spending time with family and friends over a bottle of red wine. \u201cI watched him cycle off into the sun on his treasured Ridgeback bike to watch the airshow at Shoreham for a couple of hours, but he never came home.\u201d Brightwell\u2019s family, which includes his daughter Gemma, sister Judy, nephew Adam, and parents Barbara and Ernie, paid their tributes as the sister of another man reported missing after the air crash spoke of the pain she and her family have suffered. Daniele Polito, of Worthing, was reported missing by family members who revealed he had been travelling home from work with Matt Jones, who was one of the first confirmed to have died in the crash. Appearing to confirm his death, Polito\u2019s sister Marina gave thanks for support shown to her family \u201cover the last few painful days\u201d in a Facebook post. \u201cI know many people loved him and will miss him loads, but as long as we keep him in our hearts and memories, he will never really leave us,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI miss you loads already little (big) bro! Keep making people smile, love you always.\u201d Andrew Hill, 51, a former RAF instructor and British Airways captain, was flying a 1950s Hawker Hunter when it failed to pull out of a loop-the-loop manoeuvre and plummeted on to the A27 in West Sussex before bursting into a ball of flames.
