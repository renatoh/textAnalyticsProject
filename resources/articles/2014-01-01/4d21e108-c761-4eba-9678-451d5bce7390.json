Pellegrini was reflecting on City becoming the fastest Premier League club to a century of goals in all competitions when Edin Dzeko scored against Cardiff City on 14 minutes. That beat Chelsea's record of 42 games, set last season, by eight and made the Blues the first to reach 100 before the close of January. Asked to rate his City side, who have scored 63 of those goals in the league, against a Madrid vintage that finished three points behind Pep Guardiola's great Barcelona team, Pellegrini said: \"It is different players but I think the concept of the style I want from the team is exactly the same. We scored 102 goals in the season with Real Madrid and this group of players are used to playing, independent of the score. They try to defend and attack in one way and today the first 45 minutes was one of the best 45 minutes of the season. It was incredible pace and high tempo, and we missed three or four clear goals.\" Pellegrini's City attack in endless waves. For the Chilean a greed for goals is good. When Dzeko's opener was levelled by Craig Noone's fine mazy run and shot, Jes\u00fas Navas needed only four minutes to show City's ruthless edge, giving them a lead that was stretched by further strikes from Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Sergio Ag\u00fcero towards the second half's close. After a season at Madrid, Pellegrini left to work his magic with lesser lights at M\u00e1laga. Yet common to all of his sides is the desire to ensure creativity. He said: \"We have a very good squad with top players. Maybe M\u00e1laga wasn't the same quality of players but it was a team that also played very well and nearly reached the semi-final of the Champions League. That isn't easy. The way we are playing, the players of Real Madrid or M\u00e1laga or Villarreal or any team I manage, it's the way that creative players want to play. They want to score goals and not to spend the whole match destroying or running behind the ball.\" Following the departure of the divisive Roberto Mancini, this is the campaign in which Tour\u00e9, David Silva, Ag\u00fcero, Samir Nasri, Joe Hart (despite being dropped in the autumn), Vincent Kompany and even the habitually misfiring Dzeko look and perform as if happier. Silva is again operating on the same plane he did during the first half of City's title-winning season two years ago. Tour\u00e9 glides in and out of midfield in silent, swashbuckling mood. Ag\u00fcero, Dzeko and the summer-buy \u00c1lvaro Negredo cannot stop scoring. As a member of the famous four of forwards who helped sweep Manchester United to 1999's historic treble, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Cardiff manager, can identify a fearsome frontline. \"Of course they have got three top, top strikers there and they can play with little Silva in behind so he has got loads of attacking options,\" the Norwegian said of Pellegrini and his team. \"It is a great position to be in as a manager when you can rotate and have strikers on form like they have. They have scored quite a few goals.\" Of Ag\u00fcero, whose goal was his second in consecutive games after coming on as a substitute, Solskjaer said: \"For me before his [calf] injury he was within the top five players in the world. You have got Ronaldo, Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Zlatan and Ag\u00fcero in the forward role. He is a terrific little player. You are talking about a squad with top, top quality.\" Ag\u00fcero and Negredo have 21 goals each, Dzeko 16, and Tour\u00e9 a fine 14 from midfield. For Pablo Zabaleta, the Ivorian belongs in the bracket of world-class performers. \"Yes, probably he's one of the best,\" the right-back said. \"He's a complete player. He's been really good for us, can create things from the back. We've been surprised by his free-kicks, he's scored four or five \u2013 you can't ask for any more. He's one of the main players in the team. He's really good going forward. He's scored 14 goals this season and for a central midfielder that's fantastic.\" After Fraizer Campbell managed a late consolation, Solskjaer suggested that, with his club bottom, reinforcements are needed in the current window. \"You would like to protect Fraizer a little bit because Fraizer is at the moment our centre-forward,\" he said. \"We are trying to get Andreas [Cornelius] back to full fitness. Probably we are looking at maybe bringing one in.\" Next in the league Solskjaer takes Cardiff to his alma mater, where positivity will be preached. \"You can't go to Old Trafford or the Etihad Stadium or the Emirates and not expect to get something,\" he said.
