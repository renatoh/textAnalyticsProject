Jonathan has also been given a final warning regarding his future conduct. \"Leeds United have imposed a fine of four weeks' wages against Lee Bowyer and we would also insist that Lee work at the forefront of our community programme for the whole of the balance of his contract. \"Lee has also been warned regarding his future behaviour on and off the field. \"Regrettably Lee has refused to accept this club disciplinary sanction and has therefore been placed on the transfer list with immediate effect. \"As a result of this Lee Bowyer will not be available for team selection by David O'Leary unless he accepts the club's disciplinary sanction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
