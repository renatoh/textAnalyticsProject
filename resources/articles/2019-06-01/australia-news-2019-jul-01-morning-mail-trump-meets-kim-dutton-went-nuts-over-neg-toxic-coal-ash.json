Top stories Donald Trump has invited Kim Jong-un to the US after becoming the first sitting American president to enter North Korea. The apparently impromptu meeting came about after Trump tweeted an invitation to Kim on Saturday from the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. After shaking hands with Kim in the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas and walking with him over the border, Trump said: \u201cStepping across that line is a great honour. Great progress has been made, great friendships have been made and this has been, in particular, a great friendship.\u201d Trump said sanctions against the North would remain in place, but suggested Washington might be willing to offer concessions in return for piecemeal North Korean moves towards denuclearisation. \u201cAt some point during the negotiation things can happen,\u201d he said. Malcolm Turnbull planned to bring on legislation giving effect to the national energy guarantee to stare down opposition from conservative dissidents in the Coalition party room, but pulled back after Peter Dutton and Christopher Pyne \u201cwent nuts\u201d, a new book by the journalist and former political staffer Niki Savva says. The home affairs minister is quoted as saying, in an account confirmed by Pyne, that he and Pyne \u201ceffectively had the bill pulled\u201d. The federal government must do more to protect the Aboriginal flag amid a licensing dispute, says Labor\u2019s Indigenous affairs spokeswoman, Linda Burney. Last week the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, ruled out the government buying the copyright of the flag from its designer, the Luritja artist Harold Thomas. But Burney says the government must provide clarity for Aboriginal organisations, so they know whether or not they are able to use the flag. Toxic coal waste has been found to be a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d for Australia, in a new report by Environmental Justice Australia. The report says toxins in coal ash have been linked to asthma, heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and stroke. The US Environmental Protection Agency found the risk of public exposure from ash dams can last for decades, peaking 78 to 105 years after ash storage begins. The report says there have been problems at ash dams in every mainland state, including a history of groundwater or river contamination in Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley and a failure to line dumps to prevent leaching in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley. Delta Electricity and the Australian Energy Council have rejected the report, saying it continues a campaign against fossil fuel power. World Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of cities in Sudan, in the first mass demonstrations since a crackdown on a protest camp early in June left at least 128 people dead. Protesters demanded that the ruling transitional military council hand power to civilians, as security forces fired teargas at them. An NGO rescue boat captain who has risked jail time after forcing her way into Lampedusa port in Italy with 40 migrants onboard has defended her act of \u201cdisobedience\u201d, saying it was necessary to avert a tragedy. Donations have poured in for her legal defence. The French government has released a brief clip of a discussion at the G20 summit in Osaka involving four world leaders \u2013 and Ivanka Trump. Among widespread reaction on social media, most of it critical of the first daughter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said such behaviour \u201churts our diplomatic standing\u201d. David Attenborough made a surprise appearance on the final day of Glastonbury festival, thanking the crowds for helping to reduce the use of plastic at the event. Opinion and analysis Earlier this year Erin Delaney revealed on Facebook a secret she\u2019d kept from almost everyone. As a child she suffered physical and emotional abuse and severe neglect. \u201cIt was,\u201d the 36-year-old Sydneysider says now, \u201ca challenging journey through life. I never felt safe and I never felt grounded. You grow up hating yourself and thinking you caused it and you deserve it.\u201d Delaney had always felt like she had two different selves: her secret, real self and a superficial, public persona cultivated to blend in. If Australian parents were a bank, they would be the ninth largest home loan lender in the country \u2013 bigger than the Bank of Queensland and knocking on the door of Macquarie, writes Naaman Zhou. \u201cFor many first-time buyers, a loan from their parents (the so-called \u201cbank of mum and dad\u201d) is crucial to gathering the money for a home deposit and getting approved for an eventual loan. But on 1 July, as part of recommendations from the banking royal commission, the big banks will be imposing new rules on this type of lending.\u201d Zhou spoke to experts to better understand the complex changes. \u201cAdult children can expect more rejections and lower approval amounts, while parents could end up in debt if the property market takes a turn,\u201d he writes. Sport England have reignited their World Cup campaign with a stirring victory over India, Jonny Bairstow letting his bat do the talking with a match-winning century at Edgbaston. The stakes were impossibly high for the hosts after back-to-back defeats but Eoin Morgan\u2019s side held their nerve in a 31-run success, ending India\u2019s undefeated streak and reclaiming their own place in the top four. It is 12 months since Angelique Kerber won Wimbledon for the first time, a victory she celebrated by dancing alongside Novak Djokovic at the evening champions\u2019 dinner. With the tournament kicking off tonight can Kerber defend the title, and will a new men\u2019s grand slam champion be able to get so much as a look in with the big guns all in peak form? Thinking time: Can Australia end poverty? In New Zealand and Canada, poverty rates are falling dramatically. So what would it take to lift the forgotten Australians living in poverty? Ten per cent of Australians live in income poverty (13% if you take the cost of housing into account), and up to a million live in persistent and entrenched poverty, unable to take part fully in life. The federal election is history, and those who had counted on a Labor government to focus on reducing inequality and easing poverty were disappointed,\u201d writes Gay Alcorn. \u201cScott Morrison\u2019s government has made clear it has no intention of increasing the base rate of the Newstart payment for unemployed Australians \u2013 the most intense welfare campaign of the election \u2013 even though it has seen no real increase for a quarter of a century, and despite suggestions from the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, that an increase would be \u2018good for the economy\u2019.\u201d As the Productivity Commission has noted, Australia\u2019s poverty rate has remained stubbornly high for 30 years, despite \u201cthe lucky country\u201d being one of the wealthiest in the world and enjoying decades of economic growth. As its former chairman Peter Harris has said: \u201cPerhaps simply shifting money around and doing more of the same is not sufficient.\u201d So what could work? Alcorn quizzes the experts for five ideas that would make a real difference. Media roundup Nearly 50% of Australians live with a chronic disease, the ABC reports, and many of them are preventable. Fake doctors and healthcare practitioners who have lied about their qualifications could now face jail time of up to three years, the Age reports, as part of a national crackdown on impostors who betray patient\u2019s trust. And Rugby Australia may have accidentally opened another legal avenue for Israel Folau to pursue, after suggesting that sponsors were threatening to withdraw support if the Wallabies star wasn\u2019t sacked, the Australian reports. Coming up David Hurley will be sworn in as Australia\u2019s new governor general to replace General Sir Peter Cosgrove at a formal ceremony at Parliament House.
