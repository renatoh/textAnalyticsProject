If you're on about football losing its soul, those rivalries have gone now . . . The Premier League is too predictable and it's sad. The big three or four will get bigger and they'll only go away from the other teams . . . I don't think the strength in depth in the Premier League is as good as it was. It's a tough league, but I still think it was more competitive three or four years ago.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
