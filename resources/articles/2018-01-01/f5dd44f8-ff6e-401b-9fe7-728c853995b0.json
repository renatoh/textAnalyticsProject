The Stoke manager brought himself under added pressure by fielding a weakened team for the 5-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday and that gamble failed to pay off as his side lost 1-0 at home against Newcastle. Although Hughes insisted he had no regrets about his team selection at Chelsea and claimed he \u201cwould still make the same decision given the same circumstances again\u201d, the Welshman lost his cool when pressed on that subject after Newcastle\u2019s win and stormed out of his post-match press conference. Hughes, who brought six players back into the Stoke side for Newcastle\u2019s visit, said: \u201cEveryone\u2019s saying that I gambled but I used the players that I had. What was I going to do, risk players that had a big part to play today? Plenty of teams have made changes today, everyone else is doing it too. \u201cPeople have mentioned that I played two young full-backs [at Stamford Bridge] \u2013 that\u2019s all we had, that\u2019s the reality. The plan was clearly if we could have stayed in the game a bit longer at Chelsea, maybe until half-time, then if we were in striking distance, get some more senior players and \u2018let\u2019s have a go\u2019. As it was, the game was over after 30 minutes, so I made the decision to protect them for this game. If I had won today it would have been great management. As it happens, it\u2019s gone against me. I\u2019m brave enough to take it on the chin.\u201d As well as chants of \u201cHughes out\u201d towards the end of the Newcastle game some Stoke supporters held up banners calling for the manager to be sacked. \u201cIt\u2019s to be expected,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cI think for the last two or three weeks the agenda in the media and on lots of platforms, on social media, that\u2019s what was going to happen. The noise only goes away if you win.\u201d Stoke are only two points and two places above the relegation zone, yet Hughes was bullish about his own position. \u201cWho else is going to do it?\u201d he replied, when asked about his future. \u201cIn terms of the knowledge of the group and the progress in my time here I\u2019m the best person to do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
