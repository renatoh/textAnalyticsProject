It intensified after the terrorist attacks on London in 2017 and now threatens to overshadow the president\u2019s state visit to the UK. 10 December 2015 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign pledge to ban Muslims from the US was criticised as \u201coutrageous\u201d by Sadiq Khan when he was standing to be mayor of London. He told the BBC that he hoped Trump \u201closes badly\u201d. 10 May 2016 After Khan was elected as mayor of London, Trump suggested Khan would be exempt from his proposed travel ban on Muslims. \u201cThere will always be exceptions,\u201d he said and added that the election of Khan was a \u201cgood thing\u201d. 16 May 2016 Khan said Trump\u2019s views on Muslims were \u201cignorant\u201d. Trump then challenged Khan to an IQ test. \u201cI will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements,\u201d he told ITV. 4 June 2017 After the terrorist attacks on Borough Market and London Bridge, Trump falsely suggested in a tweet that Khan had said there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d. Khan had actually said the public should not be alarmed by the increased police presence on London\u2019s streets. A spokesman for Khan responded by saying he had \u201cmore important things to do than respond to Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks\u201d. Trump followed up with another tweet, saying this was a \u201cpathetic excuse\u201d that the mainstream media was \u201cworking hard to sell\u201d. 6 June 2017 Khan called on the government to cancel Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,\u201d he said. 29 July 2017 Khan told the Guardian he was a \u201creluctant participant\u201d in his ongoing row with Trump. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not schoolchildren. He\u2019s the president of the United States, so I\u2019m unclear what his beef is with me.\u201d 5 July 2018 Khan\u2019s office gave permission for anti-Trump activists to fly a protest blimp of Trump as a crying baby in a nappy. Later, free speech campaigners made a blimp of Khan wearing a yellow bikini in protest at \u201cbody-shaming\u201d adverts the mayor vowed to ban on the London Underground. 13 July 2018 On his working visit to London, Trump claimed Khan had \u201cdone a very bad job on terrorism\u201d. He added: \u201cI think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.\u201d 1 June 2019 Khan compared the language used by Trump to rally his supporters to that of \u201cthe fascists of the 20th century\u201d. Writing in the Observer he said: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat. The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years.\u201d 2 June 2019 In an interview with the Sunday Times, Trump compared Khan to the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and said he had no plans to meet him during his state visit to London. Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t think much of him. I think that he\u2019s the twin of De Blasio, except shorter.\u201d 3 June 2019 Just before landing in the UK, Trump described Khan as \u201ca stone cold loser\u201d and \u201cvery dumb\u201d. Khan\u2019s office accused Trump of \u201cchildish insults\u201d . 15 June 2019 After three people were killed in London in the space of 24 hours, Trump retweeted a tweet from right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins and said that the UK capital needed a new mayor and that Khan was \u201ca disaster\u201d. Several hours later he tweeted again, saying that Khan was \u2018destroying the City of London.\u201d A spokesman for the mayor said that Khan\u2019s thoughts were \u201cwith the victims\u2019 families. He is not going to waste his time responding to this sort of tweet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
