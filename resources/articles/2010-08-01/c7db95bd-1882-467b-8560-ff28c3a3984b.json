It is a lesson in the dangers of underestimating beautiful things that could just as easily be applied to the film itself. In this final chapter of the Toy Story trilogy, Buzz Lightyear and his cowboy pal Woody (toys who spring to life when no one is looking) must come to terms with owner Andy growing up and leaving them behind. We take for granted now that animators can create a virtual world that looks realer than real \u2013 but while DreamWorks (with Shrek) and other studios boast technical flair, none match the storytelling magic, the wit and warmth that set Pixar apart. Its team has perfected the technique of enrapturing two audiences at once. Thanks to a mix of broad humour and carefully observed emotion, children squeal with delight while their parents (and yes, that includes dads) weep. Nor does Pixar shy away from serious themes: Wall-E was a plea for environmentalism, Ratatouille a paean to real food. Toy Story 3's theme \u2013 the end of childhood, and parents reconciling themselves to children leaving the nest \u2013 could scarcely be more timely, with A-level results bringing home the reality of many imminent departures. As our heroes learn to love a new owner, the song You've Got a Friend in Me plays over the credits. If a friend is someone who understands our sadness, and can console and cheer us, we all have a friend in Pixar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
