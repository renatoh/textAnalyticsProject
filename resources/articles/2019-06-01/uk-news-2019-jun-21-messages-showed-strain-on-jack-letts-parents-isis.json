In often heated dialogue between the Oxford couple and Jack Letts, now 23, they pleaded with him, challenged his ideology and constantly professed their love for him even as they described their deep hurt and sense of betrayal. Though not religious, the two supported Jack\u2019s conversion to Islam at the age of 16. He had been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette\u2019s and they believed Islam was just another one of his obsessions. But his grades crashed. He moved from the Cherwell School, a comprehensive, to a further education college. He was hardly ever home. He dressed differently. His parents, who also have a younger son who is now 21, cooked Jack halal meals, bought him his first thobe and ferried him around mosques. When Jack said he wanted to go to Jordan to study Islam and the Qur\u2019an, they bought his return flight tickets in May 2014, despite being told of fears by one of Jack\u2019s friends that he may have been radicalised. John Letts initially thought his son was on a \u201cgrand adventure\u201d, the trial heard. Four months later, after a phone call from Jack informing them he was in Syria, followed by radio silence for several weeks, his parents\u2019 lives fell apart. \u201cA father should never live to see his son buried,\u201d Letts pleaded in September 2014. Another message read: \u2018Jack, I\u2019ve never begged you before but I am now. Please contact us. Your mother is collapsing with fear and sadness \u2026 You don\u2019t have to die to help your fellow Muslims.\u201d The couple established he was in an Isis-controlled area, though they did not believe he was a fighter. \u201cI\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Letts wrote to a family friend. \u201cI feel terrified, betrayed by Jack, embarrassed, massively let down. I know he\u2019s not a nasty boy. But he\u2019s very stupid and I created him, with my armchair revolutionary shite.\u201d Letts told his son of his despair. \u201cThe light that filled our lives went out when you left, Jacko. Now we wait for a phone call and check Facebook constantly to see if you\u2019re still alive.\u201d The couple learned that Jack had married. Some of the messages become acrimonious on both sides, as Jack berated his parents for their criticism of his ideology. \u201cYou hurt your mother and I very deeply, but I suppose we\u2019re just nasty unbelieving western kafir enemies of Islam who need to be wiped out before your new utopian caliphate begins,\u201d Letts wrote. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve lost you and if I could forget I had a son called Jack this pain would stop. But I can\u2019t and I never will. I will stand here beside your mother and suffer with her until the end.\u201d Lane, too, chastised Jack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but I am very ashamed of you and the shame you have brought on us as a family,\u201d she wrote in June 2015. Jack hit back. \u201cYou lot brought me up without faith. You taught me and indoctrinated me to look down on religious people as brainwashed idiots [you know you did]. You taught me that life had no true purpose \u2026 that there\u2019s no afterlife and therefore no final justice. You taught me disbelief and darkness. Why should I be grateful for that?\u201d he wrote to his mother. Lane replied: \u201cWe weren\u2019t [aren\u2019t] religious ourselves. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t give you the ability to choose what belief you wanted. \u201cFor my own sanity I have to believe you at least care about us a bit and if anything happened to us you wouldn\u2019t just think \u2018Good, that\u2019s three less kafir in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
