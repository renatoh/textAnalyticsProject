I am the son of a wartime factory worker, a socialist and community activist. Yet we have found common ground. We met in 2002 when IDS (as he is known), then party leader, came to Easterhouse in Glasgow. His first stop was a local project called Fare (Family Action in Rogerfield and Easterhouse) with which I am associated. He was shocked by the poverty and its accompanying drug abuse. I was drawn by his readiness to listen to residents, and I soon I felt comfortable with him. He went to other projects and perceived, as no other political heavyweight has done, that their local, long-term staff and volunteers could transform individuals and improve neighbourhoods. He invited me to the 2003 Conservative party conference, where I spoke on the funding problems of local groups. IDS promised that, if he became prime minister, he would legislate to provide them with financial security. After my 43 years' membership of the Labour party, some of my colleagues accused me of \"sleeping with the enemy\". Once he lost the leadership, IDS could have enriched himself with company directorships or gained status in the Lords. But he told me: \"My agenda is still social justice. That's the reason I now exist in politics.\" I found that impressive. I believe he was moved partly by the social teachings of Christianity - something else that drew us together. In 2004, he launched the Centre for Social Justice. I declined to join its board, but I have been an evaluator of UK community groups for the centre's awards. His leftward switch was not over. At a fringe meeting at the Labour party conference in Manchester this year, he declared that poverty \"is not just about a lack of basics, but a lack of sufficient resources to participate in the life of the community\". He continued, saying relative poverty was \"the distance that the poorest people fall behind everyone else\". Amazingly, this was a Tory calling for greater equality - and he meant assets as well as income. Projects such as Fare pull a few out of the swamp, but the morass endures. IDS wants to clear the swamp. How did this happen? He says he has escaped the London bubble and been influenced by people at the hard end. He stated that he left Easterhouse a changed man. But can he change the Tories? He seems close to the party leader, David Cameron. But, in his recent Scarman lecture, Cameron, while promising an attack on poverty, seemed to rule out redistribution. Cameron appointed IDS as chair of the social justice policy group, whose mid-term report has just appeared. It focuses on family breakdown as a major cause of social problems. Most Tories will agree. In Manchester, a policeman asked IDS if he wanted protection. He joked: \"No, but I might at the Conservative conference.\" Certainly, if his proposals mean large tax rises, he will enrage traditional Tories. If IDS fails in his poverty objectives, he will not abandon social justice. He could seek cross-party alliances with Labour MPs disillusioned with the government. If he wants my help in promoting greater equality, he can have it. After all, New Labour has never approached me. \u00b7 Bob Holman is a community activist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
