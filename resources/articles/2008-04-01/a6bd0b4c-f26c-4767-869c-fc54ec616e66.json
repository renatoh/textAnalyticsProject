The Swiss bank, hit by over-pricing of assets by a \"handful\" of rogue City traders late last year, underlined the scale of the crisis by declaring net revenues of just Sfr3bn in the quarter, down 72%. The latest write-downs - half of them in collateralised debt obligations trading - come on top of those of Sfr3.2bn last year. They bring the bank's total to Sfr8.5bn, still far short of the Sfr37bn at its tarnished Swiss rival UBS. There were also net write-downs of Sfr566m in asset management. While the bank said it had reduced its exposure to leveraged finance by 41% and to commercial mortgages by 25%, investment banking recorded a pre-tax loss of Sfr3.5bn, compared with a profit of Sfr2bn a year earlier. The losses, representing a Sfr5bn turndown from the first quarter of 2007, are CS's first in five years and were described by Brady Dougan, chief executive, as \"clearly unsatisfactory.\" But he added: \"I am confident that we will continue to serve as a safe haven for clients in uncertain and volatile markets and to seize the opportunities that arise in times of market dislocation.\" Dougan refused to rule out further write-downs but said the worst of the losses had occurred last month, with some return to normality in April. \"In this crisis a number of times people have seen a light at the end of the tunnel and it has turned out to be a train coming down the tracks,\" Dougan said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
