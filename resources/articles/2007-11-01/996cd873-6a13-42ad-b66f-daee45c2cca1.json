What is really there is a boiling stream of disconnected bits of information that is turned into a moving picture by the brain. When it comes to recognising a picture, we have to post it up next to one of our brain-made images of the same thing. If the two don't tally we say that the photograph, drawing, painting, bust or whatever is a poor likeness. We even dare to say that it is unrealistic, as if our brain images were more real than somebody else's. There would be no point in painters simply doling out versions of pictures we can summon up at will; they impose their own convention on what they see. Art affects the brain: it teaches us how and what to see. We find a particular satisfaction in seeking out scenes and objects that we have seen pictures of: the Taj Mahal, Uluru, Paris Hilton, a snow leopard. The way we learn to make art images can also affect the way we perceive the things we are looking at. Nineteenth-century European painters in Australia simply couldn't see the shape or the colour of the trees. They drew the sclerophylls of Australia as if they had been oak and ash. Most of the people who saw their work thought of Australian vegetation as all wrong anyway and made nothing of it. Then there was Sidney Nolan. When Nolan's paintings of the outback were exhibited at David Jones's department store in Sydney in 1949, according to Cynthia Nolan, \"old ladies from central Queensland carrying string bags\" came up with tears in their eyes and said: \"It's so true, so real\". The old lady writing this travelled from south-east Queensland to Sydney to see the current Nolan retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales and found herself saying the same sort of thing. Cynthia Nolan's old ladies had not had the advantage of seeing Nolan paintings all their lives, as I have. For them the shock of recognition was exactly that. It is probably fair to say that none of them would have been Aboriginal. At no time in his life did Nolan manifest interest in Aboriginal image-making. His creativity is powered as an internal combustion engine is, by the inexorably repeated explosion of the light of the Antipodes on a cultivated European sensibility. When Nolan began painting in 1932 there was no accepted pictorial language for rendering Australia, and no master to train Nolan's eye. If there was no right way of doing things, there was also no wrong way. Nolan tried everything. Hardly knowing how to work, he kept working. As an army conscript, he was stuck in country towns, painting landscapes and portraits in housepaint on hardboard. In 1943, he discovered Ripolin, a commercially produced housepaint that could be lengthened and floated across the board. For Nolan, Ripolin was as supple as water colour and as speedy. All his life people who should have known better tittered about his facility. He could paint a whole series in a day; his life's output is something like 30,000 paintings. He said himself: \"I like painting; always liked it; always painted the same way ... I just do it and that's that.\" Not all Nolan's paintings are good; the onus is on the collector to choose. And for that you need the eye that Nolan educated. Nolan forged the pictorial language of white Australian painting. His paintings still hang vertically, and follow the classic rules of composition, if in a fractured and sometimes parodic way. We are operating within the European painting tradition, and using a version of European painterly gestures. Without impressionism and post-impressionism there would be no Sidney Nolan. Without Cezanne struggling to paint the distance between himself and Mont Saint-Victoire, Nolan would never have attempted his long views of distant ranges across a thickening scribble of eucalypts. Without Nolan there would have been no Fred Williams, no Brett Whiteley. Despite leaving Australia for England in 1953, Nolan's brain still orchestrated visual experiences in the Australian way. He painted Salt Lakes, Wimmera in 1966, drawing on memories over 20 years old. The picture is like a Tintoretto without figures, heartbreaking, terrible but unmistakeably Australian. In 1969, Nolan said, about the 18-panel polyptych Riverbend, which by itself is worth flying to Sydney to see: \"I can still evoke in myself, in my studio on the Thames, the river that I saw as a boy. A big long river, with the sun coming through the leaves, the vertical leaves of the gum tree. I've never seen it anywhere else. There is always a dappled, spotted light like a leopard on the ground, and this is the light I grew up in.\" He had to come away to see it; then he showed the rest of us how."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
