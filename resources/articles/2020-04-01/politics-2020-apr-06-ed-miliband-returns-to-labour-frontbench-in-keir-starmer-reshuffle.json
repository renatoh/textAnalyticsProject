As well as the return of the former leader, David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham who has campaigned for justice for the Windrush victims, has been promoted to shadow justice secretary. Lord Falconer, the former solicitor general who was closely associated with Tony Blair\u2019s government, will return to the shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general. The newly announced cabinet is majority female, with seven BAME MPs included. A quarter of appointees attended fee-paying schools, with just under a third Oxbridge graduates. Miliband, who was the energy secretary under Gordon Brown and led the party from 2010 until the 2015 general election, said in a statement that he looked forward to playing a part in the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. \u201cAs Keir has said, we cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will need to reshape our economy, addressing the insecurity many millions of workers face. We must also return to climate change as the unavoidable long-term issue of our time.\u201d The appointments of Miliband and Falconer to the shadow cabinet signal the ascent of the soft left in the party, at the expense of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting hard left who have dominated since 2015. Starmer\u2019s victory on Sunday was emphatic, with him winning 56.2% of the members\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 votes, having already won a majority of votes among the Parliamentary Labour party. Starmer\u2019s allies have insisted there will be no \u201cpurge\u201d of the left but add that there will be a marked shift in tone. \u201cWe will be putting the country first, and we will be presenting ourselves as an alternative government. We are not seeking ideological purity,\u201d said one. Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second behind Starmer in the contest to become leader, has been given a job as shadow education secretary. She is one of few outright supporters of Corbyn who have survived a cull of the last cabinet. Andy McDonald, another Corbyn ally, has been made shadow employment rights and protections secretary. Among those from the left of the party who were ousted were Diane Abbott, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Barry Gardiner, Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. All will now return to the backbenches. Another defeated leadership candidate, Emily Thornberry, will return as shadow international trade secretary. The newly announced shadow cabinet is majority female, with 17 women and 15 men. There are seven BAME shadow cabinet members, including Lisa Nandy, Lammy and Marsha de Cordova, the new shadow women and equalities secretary. John Healey, who covered the housing brief under Corbyn, will be the party\u2019s new defence spokesman \u2013 a tricky brief in a party torn between supporting nuclear disarmament and pressure from unions to sustain jobs in the defence sector. Those new to the shadow cabinet include: Bridget Phillipson, the member for Houghton and Sunderland South and a critic of Corbyn, who will be the shadow chief secretary to the treasury; the Birmingham Edgbaston MP Preet Kaur Gill, who will shadow the international development brief; and Thangam Debbonaire, a former whip under Corbyn who will now be the shadow housing secretary. Louise Haigh, the campaigning former policing minister who organised Nandy\u2019s campaign, has been made interim shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Tony Lloyd, the incumbent, has been hospitalised with the coronavirus, it emerged on Monday. On Sunday, Starmer surprised many when he made Nandy, another candidate he defeated to become Labour leader, his shadow foreign secretary. Anneliese Dodds, who became an MP only in 2017, was promoted to become shadow chancellor. Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, takes over from Abbott as shadow home secretary. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Miliband. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As widely predicted, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will remain in his job. Constituencies in the north-west and London are equally represented, with 19% of the shadow cabinet representing a seat in one of these two regions, while 12.5% of Starmer\u2019s cabinet represent Yorkshire and the Humber. At 49, the average age of Starmer\u2019s cabinet is slightly older than Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet (48). More than half of the shadow cabinet were born in the 1970s and 80s. Three quarters of the new shadow cabinet attended a state school, with 20 MPs attending comprehensives and four attending a grammar. A further five went to a fee-paying school, including Dodds. Nine members of the shadow cabinet studied at Oxford or Cambridge, just under a third of the total. All but three were university graduates. Commenting on the new team, Starmer said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have appointed a shadow cabinet that showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour party. \u201cThis is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.\u201d The shadow cabinet in full \u2022 Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition. \u2022 Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chair of the Labour party. \u2022 Anneliese Dodds, shadow chancellor of the exchequer. \u2022 Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary. \u2022 Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow home secretary. \u2022 Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. \u2022 David Lammy, shadow justice secretary. \u2022 John Healey, shadow defence secretary. \u2022 Ed Miliband, shadow business, energy and industrial secretary. \u2022 Emily Thornberry, shadow international trade secretary. \u2022 Jonathan Reynolds, shadow work and pensions secretary. \u2022 Jonathan Ashworth, shadow secretary of state for health and social care. \u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary. \u2022 Jo Stevens, shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary. \u2022 Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. \u2022 Luke Pollard, shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary. \u2022 Steve Reed, shadow communities and local government secretary. \u2022 Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary. \u2022 Jim McMahon, shadow transport secretary. \u2022 Preet Kaur Gill, shadow international development secretary. \u2022 Louise Haigh, shadow Northern Ireland secretary (interim while Tony Lloyd is in hospital being treated for coronavirus). \u2022 Ian Murray, shadow Scotland secretary. \u2022 Nia Griffith, shadow Wales secretary. \u2022 Marsha de Cordova, shadow women and equalities secretary. \u2022 Andy McDonald, shadow employment rights and protections secretary. \u2022 Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow minister for mental health. \u2022 Cat Smith, shadow minister for young people and voter engagement. \u2022 Lord Falconer, shadow attorney general. \u2022 Valerie Vaz, shadow leader of the house. \u2022 Nick Brown, opposition chief whip. \u2022 Lady Smith, shadow leader of the Lords. \u2022 Lord McAvoy, Lords\u2019 Opposition chief whip.
