Too Darn Hot is the relevant animal and he probably still has bundles of talent, despite being winless since autumn. But Phoenix Of Spain (4.20) beat him fair and square in the Irish Guineas and I hope to see Charlie Hills\u2019s grey confirm the form of that three-length success in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. Reportedly, he had a troubled preparation for that outing and may well be better again here. He got within two lengths of Too Darn Hot in September, looking very much like a horse who would do better with time, so there surely was no fluke about his Classic win. The progressive King Of Comedy could be a threat and his trainer pinched this race with an animal of modest talent last year but this renewal looks stronger. 2.30 Queen Anne Stakes It is surprising that Sir Michael Stoute has won this race only three times, and not for 17 years, especially as he has a record eight wins in the Lockinge Stakes, the most obvious trial. That thought is something of a brake on enthusiasm for his most recent Lockinge winner, Mustashry, but it is hard to forget the powerful finish he produced at Newbury and this steady improver is fairly priced at 5-1. Le Brivido is finally drifting to a reasonable price but has not won for two years. 3.05 Coventry Stakes This race was immediately named as the target when Threat was an impressive winner on Guineas weekend, showing professionalism to beat an odds-on favourite and proving hard to pull up. There should be plenty more to come from Richard Hannon\u2019s chestnut. Arizona won well on his second start but it is not impossible that his stablemate King Of Athens may turn that form around. 3.40 King\u2019s Stand Stakes The first and second from last year\u2019s race, Blue Point and Battaash, seem the two to focus on once again. It is interesting that the market appears dazzled by the brilliance Battaash showed at Haydock last month and he appears the more talented, at his very best. But a strike-rate of two from five last year shows he often underperforms and he did not seem to enjoy the big-day atmosphere here last year. Blue Point is taken to come out on top again. 5.00 Ascot Stakes Have we reached the stage where we will back anything Willie Mullins sends over for this? The Irish genius has won it three times in four years but his only runner this time, Buildmeupbuttercup, would be a 20-1 shot if trained by anyone else. Preference is for The Grand Visir, whose form with two previous yards gives him every chance. He showed promise over a shorter trip on his recent reappearance and should be the better for it. 5.35 Wolferton Stakes He has a tough draw to overcome but Star Of Bengal is bred to be a lot better than Listed class and represents the John Gosden/Frankie Dettori team that won this race when it first shed its handicap tag a year ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
