As the most comfortable of victories secured Arsenal a five-point cushion to fifth place, this seemed a restorative day but the final whistle was still a few minutes away when the club\u2019s civil war resumed. If the first shots were the loudest, in the form of a chorus from the visiting fans, the principal Gunner returned fire with interest, pleading for peace yet risking escalating the conflict. After supporters, with choice words, repeatedly told the absentee majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, to \u201cget out of our club\u201d, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger defended other allies from not-so-friendly fire. The Arsenal manager\u2019s gripe was that the pressure on his players, and the perception they were failing, is amplified by their own followers. He was particularly aggrieved that their north London derby draw, which followed three successive defeats, was not received more favourably. \u201cWhat hurts me is that at the important moment of the season we played in a sceptical environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think after the Tottenham game where we played a very good game with 10 men against 11 and came back to 2-2, I couldn\u2019t understand why \u2013 at the moment when you need everyone behind the team \u2013 we had to hit that storm. From the media, OK. From our fans? It is a bit more difficult to take.\u201d More placatory comments followed. \u201cI never complain about critics, especially when they are turned against me,\u201d Wenger added. \u201cBut we have to get the fans behind us with our attitude, and make sure that they stand behind the team until the end of the season.\u201d It was a call for unity, even if the rival camps\u2019 positions seem more entrenched. Supporters are disenchanted \u2013 some used Kroenke as a proxy for Wenger and one banner proclaimed \u201cTime for change, Arsenal FC not Ars\u00e8ne FC\u201d \u2013 and the club\u2019s establishment feel their arguments betray an ingratitude. The masses want prizes, the manager talks about pounds. \u201cI built this club over 19 years with the quality of my work, not with resources from outside,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cNot with big sponsorship but by caring about every pound that I spent.\u201d A game notable for fiscal prudence and footballing excellence was a typically Wenger-esque occasion. He can see victories as vindication. Rather than ploughing much of Arsenal\u2019s vast cash reserves into the January transfer market, he acquired Mohamed Elneny for \u00a37.4m. The busy Egyptian exerted an influence. Otherwise Wenger found the answers within. He can be a master of mid-season improvisation, even if the way his initial plans unravel means he sometimes has to be, and he looks for renewal and rejuvenation from his own. Last season Francis Coquelin was catapulted from obscurity. Now Alex Iwobi made an auspicious first league start, garnished with a goal. Wenger has long resisted entreaties to buy a world-class centre-forward and instead reiterated his faith in Danny Welbeck, the other scorer. Arsenal\u2019s seasons invariably end with the question of what might have been if only key players had stayed fit. Welbeck\u2019s campaign began on Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cYou cannot say you don\u2019t miss a player of that stature for eight months,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe can make a real difference in the final eight games.\u201d He has an instinctive preference for continuity, on the playing staff and in the backroom team alike. He is on course for a 20th consecutive top-four finish; the accusation is that Arsenal are in a state of stasis, the reality that Wenger is, to paraphrase Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, a specialist in averting failure. The Frenchman\u2019s belief is that they are progressing. \u201cThe club has moved forward a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to continue that.\u201d While a growing faction urge him to leave Arsenal, he has rejected offers from many another club to stay. Would he care to put a number on it? A manager whose grounding in economics gives him a famously good grasp of the figures affected an ignorance. \u201cNo,\u201d he said with a knowing smile.
