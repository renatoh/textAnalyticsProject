Sunday at the Madejski, plenty of parking, music, entertainment and nearly 22,000 watching London Irish versus Sale in the Premiership in a smart all-seat stadium. Monday, the Exiles second XV versus Wasps at Sunbury, home to Irish before they moved closer to the M4. It's like a potted history of rugby in England since it went professional and a real warning of what there is to lose. Just recently we've heard those siren voices asking that the salary cap be raised from the current \u00a34m. Spooked by the fact that only one English club have made it through to the knockout stages of the Heineken Cup this season, they argue that French sides, currently without a limit on what they can pay, are gobbling up all those players who would otherwise be coming here. According to Leicester for one, things will only get worse if the ceiling is not raised, with France's Top 14 and even the Magners League proving ever more attractive. Looked at in isolation they might seem to have a case. After all Jonny Wilkinson and now Carl Hayman have been lured to Toulon, Ricky Flutey is in Brive and James Haskell in Paris, but a few more voices have been heard this week and some interesting figures released which suggests we won't be taking to the life rafts just yet. Most interesting were the statistics from Premier Rugby which show that despite the economic climate and a few playing difficulties which have had a negative impact on the quality of rugby, we are sitting relatively pretty. The average Premiership gate is now 13,608 \u2013 higher than in France and getting closer to the Super 14 where gates are drawn from whole provinces rather than just clubs. You can put some of that down to more than 40,000 watching every time Saracens move a game to Wembley, or the 76,000 who watched us play Harlequins at Twickenham at Christmas \u2013 a figure we hope to beat with our Help for Heroes game against Bath at Twickenham in three weeks \u2013 but it also reflects a growing fan base which, you could argue, is a consequence of some nifty thinking in having a salary cap and then keeping it at realistic levels. Without it, rugby could easily have gone down the football route where success often depends on the depth of the owner's pockets. I'm not saying that clubs have not bought their way to silverware \u2013 Sale's owner, Brian Kennedy, admitted only recently that their present difficulties are in part the consequence of buying big to become champions \u2013 but playing budgets have not been ridiculously out of kilter. OK, I know there are clubs who want the ceiling raised, but equally there are plenty of clubs who can't afford to spend the \u00a34m allowed. The result is a league in which, on their day, any side can beat any other. Look at the table. This is the sharp end of the season and seven points cover the bottom five clubs, while six sides have a realistic shot at the play-offs. Between now and the end of the season almost every game will be significant, which suggests a league in good health. Obviously we must not rest on our laurels, but a peep across the Channel is increasingly illuminating. Next season there will be a salary cap of around \u00a37m, which will be a considerable drop in playing budget for clubs such as Toulouse and Clermont Auvergne. How well it's policed is another matter, but there are signs that the French federation's financial watchdog \u2013 the DNACG \u2013 may be sharpening its teeth. This week, while most minds were on Hayman's move from Newcastle to Toulon and not back to New Zealand for the World Cup, the DNACG's announcement that it wants a look at the books of Stade Fran\u00e7ais might have slipped under the radar. There is no suggestion that Stade are going bust or that the federation might deduct points or even relegate them, but one of the most glamorous teams in Europe is being invited to explain an operating loss of \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.2m). Montauban and Bourgoin have been in a similar position, but it's Stade's plight that caught the eye, coming as it does when the club are struggling. Down in eighth position, they are in danger of missing the Top 14 play-offs for the first time in a decade while losing their seemingly permanent place in the Heineken Cup. Makes you think, doesn't it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
