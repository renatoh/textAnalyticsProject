But the archive-only approach \u2013 unlike the 2007 picture In the Shadow of the Moon, there are no contemporary interviews, just material recorded at the time \u2013 lends the film an immersive sense of urgency. Like the rows of crew-cut, clench-jawed scientists staring fixedly at banks of grainy screens 50 years before, we almost forget to breathe as Armstrong manoeuvres a rickety little capsule that looks like it\u2019s held together with duct tape and faith. There is no shortage of factual films that explore this moment. But a combination of superb research \u2013 behind-the-scenes footage is augmented by newsreel shots of crowds camped out in the car park of a JC Penney department store, craning to catch a glimpse of history \u2013 and first-rate editing makes this lift off. A celebration of human endeavour, and of a rare moment of global unity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
