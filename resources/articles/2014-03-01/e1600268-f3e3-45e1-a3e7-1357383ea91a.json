Hit the post, created Van Persie's second goal, won tackles and was involved in everything Man of the match Danny Welbeck 8 Runs in behind gave United extra zest and created pockets of space in which Rooney and Van Persie were able to thrive Robin van Persie 8 Won and scored a penalty, tapped in a second and completed a hat-trick with a free-kick. Maybe he wants to stay after all? Olympiakos Roberto 5 Flapped a couple of times and good saves from Rooney and Evra were spoilt when he failed to react to Van Persie's free-kick Leandro Salino 4 Isolated in defence and impotent in attack. Produced little of note until he was booked for kicking the ball away and substituted Kostas Manolas 5 Booked five minutes in for clipping Welbeck's heels and was generally given the runaround by United's front men Iv\u00e1n Marcano 5 Failed to get close to Van Persie until he was booked at the death for remonstrating with the Dutchman as he lay injured on the floor Jos\u00e9 Holebas 6 Drove forward to set up an early chance but his silly challenge gave away the penalty and his threat diminished Delvin N'Dinga 6 Kept going in central midfield but struggled to stop Carrick and Giggs feeding United's strikers and shooting was woeful Giannis Maniatis 6 The Olympiakos captain battled on manfully and kept cajoling his team but failed to exert any great influence Hernan Per\u00e9z 6 Tested United's defence with his late surges into the box but was withdrawn before the hour to make way for a striker Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez 8 Heartbeat of the Greek side, his clever promptings meant United could never settle completely. Unlucky not to score David Fuster 7 The Spanish midfielder was good on the ball and had a couple of decent efforts on goal but will curse De Gea's brilliance Joel Campbell 8 Quick, tricky and with an eye for a pass, the Arsenal loanee was a constant menace but faded in the second half"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
