Marking the latest defection in a brewing civil war that threatens to tear apart the GOP before the general election in November, Ryan, who will chair the party convention in Cleveland in July, said Trump had yet to prove he shared the conservative values and principles necessary to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point,\u201d Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential nominee, told CNN in an interview on Thursday when asked if he was backing Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not there right now.\u201d Trump responded to Ryan on Thursday evening, with a statement that was relatively tame by the standards he has shown when criticized in the past. \u201cI am not ready to support Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPerhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!\u201d Republicans remain torn on whether to embrace Trump, who became the presumptive nominee following his victory in the Indiana primary this week and the withdrawals of Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Ryan has rebuked several of Trump\u2019s controversial statements over the past few months, including his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US and a refusal to disavow an expression of support from a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cThe bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to underplay what he accomplished \u2026 but he also inherits something very special, that\u2019s very special to a lot of us. \u201cThis is the party of Lincoln and Reagan and [former congressman and champion of supply side economics] Jack Kemp. And we don\u2019t always nominate a Lincoln or a Reagan every four years, but we hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln- or Reagan-esque, that that person advances the principles of our party and appeals to a wide, vast majority of Americans.\u201d Ryan\u2019s comments came a day after his counterpart in the Senate, majority leader Mitch McConnell, offered a tepid endorsement of Trump in a statement. On Thursday, McConnell\u2019s office said he was notified of Ryan\u2019s interview in advance. Ryan emphasized that he did not believe Republicans should vote for Hillary Clinton, who is on course to be the Democratic nominee. But he added that Trump must work to unite the Republican party and run a campaign that Americans can be \u201cproud to support and proud to be a part of\u201d. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a ways to go from here to there,\u201d Ryan said. Trump is poised to accept the nomination at the Republican convention. Several prominent figures have said they will not attend, including former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush, who also confirmed through a family spokesman that they will sit out the remainder of the presidential election. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who dropped out of the 2016 race in February, will also skip the convention. The 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, who in March delivered a scathing takedown of Trump\u2019s candidacy, has said he will neither vote for Trump nor attend the convention. Senator John McCain, the 2008 nominee, will sit out the convention but has wrestled with the question of whether he will support Trump in the general election. McCain is one of several Republican senators who face a tough re-election battle this November \u2013 races that will now be all the more hard-fought as Democrats seek to define them as belonging to the \u201cParty of Trump\u201d. According to an audio recording obtained by Politico, at a private fundraiser last month McCain offered his candid assessment of how a Trump nomination would affect his chances of holding on to his Senate seat. \u201cIf Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30% of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life,\u201d he said. Trump, who launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d, has shown little indication that he would transform into an effective courter of the Hispanic vote, although he did win the Republican caucuses in Nevada. On Thursday the bombastic billionaire used Twitter to share a photo taken at Trump Tower in Manhattan, in which he marked the Cinco de Mayo anniversary with a taco bowl and the caption: \u201cHappy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!\u201d The cracks extend even to some who are not defending seats. Ben Sasse, a first-term senator from Nebraska, shared on Facebook an open letter stating his opposition to Trump. In the letter, Sasse wrote that his voicemail was full of \u201cparty bosses and politicos\u201d urging him to unite behind Trump because he was better than Clinton. \u201cThis open letter aims simply to ask \u2018WHY is that the only choice?\u2019\u201d Sasse wrote. \u201cI signed up for the party of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 and I will work to reform and restore the GOP \u2013 but let\u2019s tell the plain truth that right now both parties lack vision.\u201d In an op-ed published on Thursday, the conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal added its voice to the intra-party anguish. \u201cMr Trump may be able to improve his image if he controls his perpetual insult machine, but there is little evidence that he can or will do so,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cThe essence of his politics is personal, and it\u2019s not obvious he knows any other way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
