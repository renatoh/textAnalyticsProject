Stepping away from his role as Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup-winning captain in Paris last September, the 48-year-old Dane peels away the facade which conceals the raw problems of mental health in golf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a young man you hide your feelings,\u201d Bj\u00f8rn says. \u201cYou keep pushing it away until you can\u2019t do it any more. I finally realised I had to get everything out. I had to have those conversations with myself in the mirror. I had to be so honest and strip things bare. When I went through it the second time I was receptive to my feelings, to building myself up again.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s and Michael Calvin\u2019s new book, Mind Game, is an unflinching yet beautifully written account of the psychological trauma he suffered as a golfer. It is an equally gripping portrayal of the internal struggle faced by many of his contemporaries. Some of the men Bj\u00f8rn led to Ryder Cup glory \u2013 including Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson \u2013 share their moving stories. They offer a salutary reminder that, rather than just being millionaires in golf\u2019s pampered world, they are as vulnerable and conflicted as most people. The book opens with Bj\u00f8rn staring at himself in the mirror. His eyes are filled with tears as he asks a series of stark questions: \u201cWhy are you crying? Why do you put yourself through this pain? Why do you play this game? Do you really want to continue?\u201d Bj\u00f8rn, in his first interview since completing the book, takes a deep breath as we return to these dark moments. \u201cI was close to giving up the game,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the end it\u2019s almost like I didn\u2019t want to get up in the morning. This happens because the problems you see in your head are so much bigger than they are in reality. They take over your mind. \u201cYou can ask all the people in the world but in the end, if your mind doesn\u2019t respond, all of that is just noise. You need to take responsibility for what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s like trying to quit smoking. If you don\u2019t want to stop smoking, you can have all the help in the world and it\u2019s not going to get you there. But then you wake up one morning and you\u2019re coughing so much, and feeling so crap, you decide: \u2018I have to beat this.\u2019 You need to want to do it. My tool was having those conversations with the mirror. Those conversations were not made up. They happened.\u201d How long did Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s first bout of depression last? \u201cI went through a season where I certainly didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. I had kids, so I had to. But I wanted to hide from the world \u2013 and my life. This was around 2004. I then had a good stretch but I had it again about 2010. The first time lasted a long time because you avoid the truth and try to cut corners. It will stay with you until you look in the mirror. \u201cThat was my tool to deal with it. When you start sliding down it\u2019s very important to remember how you got out of it last time. As you get older that becomes easier. So mental health in young people is something we need to address much more. Young people are much softer and don\u2019t have the life experience. When you\u2019re older and you\u2019ve taken yourself out of the situation twice, three times, it\u2019s easier to see the warning lights.\u201d Despite its conservative and mannered surface, golf is a brutal sport mentally. As Bj\u00f8rn says, no other sport offers such a lonely battle where your real opponent is always yourself and you stand over a little white ball which is never touched by any rival. \u201cSnooker is the only sport that comes close. I\u2019m thinking more about the guy sitting and watching when his opponent is at the table. What\u2019s going through his head? That\u2019s the same in golf. The walk between shots gives you so much time. You think of the consequences so much. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I felt as Ryder Cup captain. In the first six months I had it all in place. But then I had so much time to second-guess myself. Over-analysing in sport, in life, can lead to negative thoughts. An over-active brain is not great for sport. I can get caught in a corner and sit there and think for hours. And then, all of a sudden, it\u2019s easy to get in a downward spiral. It was the same with Henrik Stenson. I\u2019d seen the darkest side of the game through him.\u201d It says much about the compassion of Bj\u00f8rn that, recalling the three times he cried on the golf course, he twice shed tears of happiness for his friends. He cried when Adam Scott won the 2013 Masters because he regarded the Australian as being like a younger brother. Even more movingly he could not stop his tears when Stenson won the Open in 2016. Bj\u00f8rn remembered how, a dozen years before, Stenson was so tormented by his game he could barely hit the ball. \u201cAt that time Henrik got something very much like a brain freeze \u2013 of not being able to hit the ball. Watching it then, and we were quite young, you don\u2019t fully understand all he is going through. But in later years, as you get into dark places yourself, you realise what turmoil he must have been in. I learned that you should never judge. \u201cBut from that low Henrik lifted himself to where he became, arguably, the best player in the world for a period of time. That shows how the mind shapes so much of our lives. Sportspeople are privileged with a good life. But that doesn\u2019t mean their mental health will never be affected. They get pushed into pressurised situations all the time \u2013 and it can spin itself into a situation where they can\u2019t handle it. This is sport\u2019s dark side.\u201d Stenson was one of Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s four captain\u2019s picks in the Ryder Cup last year. His choice of Stenson, Ian Poulter, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Paul Casey was criticised as \u201can old pals\u2019 act\u201d \u2013 but his wildcard players won a record 9\u00bd points between them as Europe, inspired by Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s calm leadership, beat the US 17\u00bd-10\u00bd. \u201cI know them so well, those four,\u201d he says simply. \u201cI\u2019m an observer of human beings. I knew how they would react. But it was not just these four. All 12 of my European players were willing to listen and do everything for each other. I was lucky. I\u2019ve been involved in a lot of Ryder Cups and I\u2019ve never seen players show up in the way my 12 did.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn cried in Paris when, after the cup had been won, he saw his children. In that moment did he also feel he was no longer typecast as the man who lost the Open in a bunker? On the 16th tee of the final round of the 2003 Open at Royal St George\u2019s Bj\u00f8rn held a two-shot lead with three holes to play \u2013 but it took him three shots to get out of that deadly bunker. Bj\u00f8rn lost the Open and the scars ran deep. Surely most people now think of him as a victorious Ryder Cup captain? \u201cProbably more people associate me with this now \u2013 and not something that happened 16 years ago in a bunker on the south coast of England. Hopefully that balances it out. But people who were there, or watched it on TV, will always remember my moments in that bunker.\u201d Did it impact on his mental health? \u201cYes. I thought I dealt with it really well in the moment, because it\u2019s only golf. It\u2019s not life-threatening. It\u2019s a moment that gives somebody else success. That happens in sport all the time. But once you\u2019re in it you stand alone. Every time you met somebody that was the only thing they asked you about. In the end it gets you.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn still plays golf, on a limited basis, as he works out what he wants to do with the rest of his life. \u201cI\u2019m not really making any big decisions yet. I said after the Ryder Cup I needed three months. I probably need a full year to let the world settle down. I love playing. I love travelling. I love being on tour. I don\u2019t know 80% of the players now. There are young kids coming through from all corners of the world that are fantastic players. I love seeing developments in the game and being in it. I still want to live my life from inside the ropes.\u201d The game almost broke him but now, free from the anguish which stalked him so long, Bj\u00f8rn sounds at peace. \u201cI used to blame the game for how I was feeling. But you end up hating golf because it\u2019s easy to hate. It\u2019s like hating a government because it\u2019s easy to blame somebody else. But this is your life and you can turn it around. It\u2019s not the game\u2019s fault. I am happy I found a way to learn to love the game, and life, again.\u201d Mind Game: The Secrets of Golf\u2019s Winners, by Michael Calvin and Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, is published by Yellow Jersey In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
