In late 2011, with the London riots fresh in the mind, 17 youngsters were recruited to enact Shakespeare's storm-play on an Oval housing estate. Their efforts are here given an off-putting, skittish treatment, slapping together rehearsal footage with animated inserts and talking heads that suggest how Prospero may have washed up on TV's The Office. The kids energise it, but it's a choppy jumble of good intentions and half-realised ideas, too wind-tossed in its structure to function even as a useful teaching aid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
