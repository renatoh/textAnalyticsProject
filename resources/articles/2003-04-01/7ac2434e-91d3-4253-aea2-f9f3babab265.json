An impressive house in the heart of London's Little Venice canal area is for sale, and it has a curious history. According to agent FPD Savills, the garage belonging to the house was once Guerilla Studios, where Lulu sang and Sting cut his first demo disc. Amis is said to have lived in the house in 1965, when it was split into flats. Now for sale as one residence - and with a \u00a33.25 million price tag - you get four bedrooms, a 60ft garden, and great views of the Regents Canal. Just around the corner, a house once owned by pop star Dave Stewart is for sale. Over six floors, the white stucco house has seven bedrooms, an impressive drawing room and even a spa and sauna. A houseboat - one of the widest on the nearby canal - is also available by separate arrangement. The house itself will set you back \u00a32,250,000 (Knight Frank, 020 7586 2777). Aldous Huxley's former London home is on the market. In a desirable, tree-lined road in Hampstead, it requires total renovation, and with seven bedrooms and five reception rooms it could make a great family home. The blue plaque outside says Julian and Leonard Huxley, fellow 'men of science and letters', lived there too. It's yours for \u00a32m (FPD Savills, 020 7472 5000)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
