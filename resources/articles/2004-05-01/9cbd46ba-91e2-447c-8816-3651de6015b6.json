But yesterday the world No3, getting as close to animated as he ever does, launched himself at what he sees as the evils of the long putter and its slightly smaller companion, the belly putter. Els was speaking after getting round in 67, five under par, in the first round of the Deutsche Bank tournament, a score that left him two behind Trevor Immelman, a compatriot and friend and a recent convert to the belly putter. Immelman jointly leads with Gregory Havret and David Howell, with Jos\u00e9 Maria Olazabal among those one behind Asked if he had used a belly putter, Els said abruptly and forthrightly: \"No. And they definitely should be banned. I believe nerves and the skill of putting are part of the game. Take a tablet if you can't handle it.\" The South African, who has recently been going through purgatory on the greens, has not even been tempted by a club that he believes removes some skills from the game. \"I have never even had a long putter in my hands,\" he said. \"I wouldn't, on principle. \"It's so much easier a way to putt. You actually push it into your body and then you can make a perfect stroke. Just putting with your hands you are not always going to be in the right position. But with the long putter you can just draw it back, let it go and it will make a pendulum stroke for you. I'm so concerned that I spoke to Peter Dawson about it at the US Masters last month.\" Dawson, the chief executive of the Royal &amp; Ancient, admitted yesterday that he and Els \"had had a chat\". \"That's one of the reasons I go to major championships,\" said Dawson, \"so I can get the views of leading players about all aspects of the game, and these long putters are certainly under discussion. \"At the moment they are legal and I do not expect any imminent announcement otherwise. But I think the advent of the belly putter has re-opened the debate. There seems to be an advantage there and we will be talking to the USGA and among ourselves to see if anything needs to be done.\" What with a crusading Els and with Olazabal telling the man from another broadsheet, \"I would love to punch your face\", it was a lively day here. The Spaniard's threat was, of course, made in jest, although it illustrated a point. Olazabal has had an awful season, sliding down every ranking list to the extent that not only is he a million miles from a Ryder Cup place, he will also, for the first time in his career, have to try to qualify for a major championship, the US Open next month. All through his decline, of course, there has been an almost morbid interest in this winner of two US Masters and when, once again, a question began, \"when you have a long run of things not going well\", it was little wonder that a smiling Spaniard offered fisticuffs. Gallant to the end, the journalist offered to be the recipient \"if it will make you play well again\". But Olazabal knows what is wrong: it is just a question of putting it right. How does he deal with it? \"I love the game and I do have to love it a lot otherwise I wouldn't be here. I don't give up easily, and there is also the trust of the people that surround you. If it was a lonely fight I don't think many people would have the courage or the strength to stick with it.\" Yesterday, though, he hit 10 of 14 fairways and holed four putts of 15-18 feet and another of 40."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
