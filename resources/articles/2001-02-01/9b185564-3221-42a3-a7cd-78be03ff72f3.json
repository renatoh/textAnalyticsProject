Nearly 46 years later, the mouse's latest 3D fantasia, Disney's California Adventure, has opened in what used to be the parking lots alongside the veteran Disneyland. Here, California's major attractions have been shrunk and set cheek-by-jowl with one another. Got no time to tour the Golden Gate and the Napa Valley, or Hollywood? Well, head on down to Anaheim, Orange County, just 27 miles south of central Los Angeles and see it all for 43 bucks a day at this latest $1.4bn tourist magnet. If you're a theme park addict, the combination of Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure and the new Downtown Disney - an open-air shopping mall conjured from every style of local architecture - should prove to be addictive. If there's a difference between old and new, then Disneyland is more for children and Disney's California Adventure more for - I was going to say grown-ups, but that's not quite right - Americans and those enthralled by US culture who want to experience heart-in-mouth, brain-in-trainers fun-fair rides and a touch of California without the hassle of freeway tailbacks and the dangers, real or imagined, of walking - as if - in downtown LA. If, though, like me, this is your very first theme park, then the wonderful world of Disney really is hard to come to terms with. I know it's essentially for kids and the child in all of us, and I know that one should suspend disbelief and relax, yet the whole experience is so darned controlling that anyone who hates passivity is in danger of going bonkers. Old and new theme parks and the new bit of ersatz downtown between them are so squeaky clean, so punctuated by loudspeakers, so patrolled by cheerleaders, so laced with long queues for rides, I wanted to believe that, like Dumbo, I could fly and disappear into the magnificent mountainscape that beckons north and west of Anaheim. Disney's is the kind of world that can turn a grown man to drink (which I did one night, unable to face spending a whole night alone in a room at the Disney Pier Hotel with a bedspread covered in Mickey Mouse ears; portraits of the Mouse and Goofy on the walls; Mickey Mouse soap, shampoo and body lotion in the bathroom; and the utterly surreal sight of the new theme park lit-up like a marshalling yard on acid outside the window). Don't get me wrong. I adore the schmaltzy sweetness of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, yet I can easily imagine why some of the top artists working on Disney's greatest feature back in 1936-7 turned to drawing pictures of Walt's flawless heroine in orgiastic embraces with Bashful, Sleepy, Grumpy and gang. It's easy, too, after a couple of days here, to sympathise with Disney scriptwriter Mike Myers, who was new to the studio's story department in the late 30s; here he is making his debut at a storyboard conference: \"Donald Duck leaps outta bed madder 'n a goddam harnit. He trips over a pair of shoes and falls on his ass, then the fuckin' duck jumps to his feet and runs out of the fuckin' door.\" A senior colleague, Dave Hand, stopped Myers: \"Walt won't stand for you referring to Donald as 'that fuckin' duck'!\" Nonplussed, Myers replied: \"Well, that's what he is, ain't he?\" That story comes from Steven Watts' meticulously researched The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life (1997). In taking a trip down Walt's memory lane, Watts shows us - as several authors, many more strident, have done - that this was no yellow brick road. Disney's childhood (born in Chicago, 1900; raised in Marceline, Missouri and then Kansas City) was less than idyllic. His father, Elias, a puritanical Congregationalist emerges as an over-zealous, anti-Semitic disciplinarian bully. What Walt sought to create in later life was the childhood he wished he had enjoyed, a childhood that Middle Americans from Anaheim to Albany, Buffalo to Baton Rouge wished they had enjoyed, too. Here's Uncle Walt giving a radio talk at the time of Snow White: \"In every one of us something remains of our childhood; in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot deep down in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget and that maybe our picture can help recall.\" Which leads us inexorably to Disneyland and its latest offspring. Main Street, Disneyland, was a scaled-down and loved-up recreation of Marceline, the hicksville town that Disney wanted to believe was more magical than it ever really was in the few years he lived there during his childhood. Straddling acre after acre of former orange groves, Disneyland is a hermetic world that has drawn admirers unashamedly high-brow and archly populist; in 1963, the chairman of a conference on urban planning at Harvard described the faux-town as \"the greatest piece of urban design in the US\". He had obviously forgotten Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and downtown Savannah, but who's arguing? The latest stage is gained through what looks like a giant postcard with letters, nearly 12ft tall, spelling out C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A. Step inside, folks, and here's a recreation, of sorts, of Hollywood Boulevard, of Fort Edwards Air Force base (from where Chuck Yeager was first to break the sound barrier in 1947) and Soarin' over California, a superb Imax ride that makes you feel, wind-in-the-hair and all, that you're flying over this beautiful state. This is state-of-the-mouse technology that makes everything at last year's dreary Millennium Experience look much less than the \u00a31bn it cost to make us angry. It's a cliche, I know, but whatever you think of the idea of Disney's themed world, boy, do they do the rides well. I thought I would hate being twisted and hurled down the rocky rapids of the Grizzly Bear Run, yet I loved this white-water rafting ride, and when it was over, and soaked to the skin, we did it all over again. I even got to like California Screamin', a whizz of a roller-coaster that shoves you off from rest faster than a Shelby Cobra and loops the loop, comically, around Mickey Mouse's ears. I liked the It's Tough to be a Bug animatronic-assisted 3D movie during which giant black-widow spiders fall from the ceiling, creepy crawlies seem to run under and over your seat and pretty cartoon bees and butterflies appear to be flapping and singing before you in mid-air. For those few minutes, I did find Disney enchanting; and for a few minutes more riding the Haunted House back over the way in Disneyland and, best - or worst - of all, the mind-numbing It's a Small World. On this ride, designed for the New York World's Fair of 1964-5 by the illustrator Mary Blair, you potter on boats very slowly through luridly coloured tableaux - blues, greens, yellows, hot pinks and oranges - saluting the world's children. These are odd little puppets that sing, over and over again, a potty song that could break the morale of the toughest terrorist under interrogation by security services. For a couple of hours, I allowed myself to swing, if not exactly wish, on Uncle Walt's star. I was much happier, though, playing stick and ball with my friend Emily's dogs through an LA park with the commercial towers of the city and the snow-capped ring of the San Rafael Mountains around us. Goofin' around with real dogs brings me, for one, a lot closer to the innocence of childhood than meeting actors dressed as Pluto or Goofy. Or beachcombing idly along the California shoreline, bare feet in the lapping water. Or taking a shining limousine for a tour of Universal Studios and dreaming of being the king or queen of Hollywood. Yet, no one can doubt that Disney and his successors know what they are doing. Sure, it's nuts to compress California into a few hundred acres of Orange County, but this daisy-chain of theme parks is an escape from reality, not a reflection of it. In any case, so much of the daily experience of the chintzier or more picturesque parts of the US have been planned, regulated, clipped and groomed into a perfect version of their former selves, it can be hard to tell theme park from reality. The theme parks of Anaheim are ultimately a fanfare for the common man, woman and, above all, child, in search of escape, however contrived, and in love with an impossible folkish dream of flying elephants, fairytale castles and wild frontiers. If, ultimately, they pall, perhaps it's just that we're not all-Americans... yet.
