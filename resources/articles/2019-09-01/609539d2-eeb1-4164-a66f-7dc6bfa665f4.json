Friday\u2019s program in Washington ran like clockwork while everybody had a script. But once we\u2019d cleared the pomp and circumstance of the ceremonial welcome for Scott Morrison on the South Lawn of the White House, once the Australian press pack tumbled out of the sparkling autumn sunshine into the Oval Office \u2013 we discovered Trump in an expansive mood. The leader of the free world kicked off proceedings by announcing the administration was now imposing sanctions on Iran, targeting the national bank, in response to Tehran\u2019s alleged involvement in drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities last weekend. As could have been predicted, these were the biggest sanctions anyone had ever seen. \u201cThe highest sanctions ever imposed on a country,\u201d Trump purred. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it to this level.\u201d The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, then appeared in the corner of the room, just in case we\u2019d failed to be sufficiently awed by the scale of the undertaking. \u201cThis is very big,\u201d Mnuchin duly reported, and departed. The president then volunteered he intended to have a quiet word to Scott Morrison over the course of their meetings on Friday, Washington time, about potential military options in Iran, and whether Australia might be persuaded to join a new coalition of the willing. \u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing that later,\u201d Trump said. Given this minor mic drop had n-o-t been telegraphed by Australian officials in advance, Morrison maintained his best poker face as the president informed the hyperventilating press pack \u201cI always like a coalition\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said, sanguine with his forward sizzle. He then settled his face into an expression he clearly regarded as Delphic. Before we could process the information that Australia might be off to war in Iran, things spiralled. The unheralded military action could be \u2013 wait for it \u2013 nuclear. Trump noted America had renovated the arsenal and acquired new nuclear capability, and the rest of the military was \u201call brand new\u201d. \u201cWe all hope, and Scott hopes, we all pray that we never have to use nuclear,\u201d Trump intoned. It was unclear precisely what Scott\u2019s hopes were just in that moment. I\u2019d hazard a guess the prime minister\u2019s most fervent aspiration was his host would stop talking. Preferably five minutes ago. It could have been my imagination, but it is possible Jenny Morrison\u2019s eyebrows touched her hairline at the precise moment Trump said the word nuclear. With vexed options now tumbling out of Trump\u2019s mouth at a clip, it did seem prudent to check in with the prime minister at this point. What was his position on Australia joining military action in Iran? Morrison soothed. America, the Australian prime minister noted, had taken a very \u201cmeasured approach\u201d with Iran \u201cto date\u201d. Of course we would listen to whatever requests our Washington friends made, but it was important that we didn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves, the prime minister counselled. Let\u2019s just keep talking and take this one step at a time, Morrison thought, or prayed, it wasn\u2019t clear. Perhaps taking Morrison\u2019s cue, or perhaps ignoring it entirely \u2013 again one can only speculate \u2013 Trump then proceeded to praise himself for his restraint. It would be so easy, the president said to no one in particular and everyone at the same time, to knock out 15 major things in Iran. \u201cI could do it right here,\u201d he said, and that appeared entirely plausible. \u201cIt\u2019s all set to go. I could do it right here and then you\u2019d have a nice big story to report,\u201d he said. But of course there was a plot twist. \u201cI think the strong person\u2019s approach, and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint,\u201d Trump said. But the strange out-loud dialogue between bellicose Trump and restrained Trump, a dual personality embodied in a presidency, persisted. \u201cMuch easier to do it the other way. It\u2019s much easier. And Iran knows if they misbehave they are on borrowed time,\u201d the president said. There was another plot twist before day was done. Having telegraphed in the Oval he intended to talk to Morrison about military coalitions, by the time we rolled around to the official press conference in the East Room, with everyone back on their talking points, Iran was so yesterday. It hadn\u2019t really come up, Trump told reporters still attempting to process what on earth was going on. (When I say reporters, just to be clear, I mean the Australian contingent. The Americans are entirely used to this circus and neatly prune the tangible from the hypothetical without even breaking a sweat). Trump thought the sanctions would work and military action would work \u201cbut that is a very severe form of winning. But we win. Nobody can beat us militarily. No one can even come close.\u201d He also mentioned, just in case it needed saying, that America\u2019s nuclear capability was in \u201ctippy top\u201d shape. Morrison then had the task of summarising the surrealism. \u201cAs the president said,\u201d the Australian prime minister said calmly, \u201cthere are no further [military] activities planned.\u201d The politically vexed question about whether Australia would do more than protect freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz was therefore moot. If any request was forthcoming, Australia would consider it on its merits, through the prism of national interest, Morrison said, before gathering his host, smiling at the cameras, and exiting, stage right. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to \u201cspring sunshine\u201d when autumn sunshine was meant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
