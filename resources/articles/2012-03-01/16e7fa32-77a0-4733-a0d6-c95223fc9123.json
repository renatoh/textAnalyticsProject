As I was 73 at that time, this meant I had a \"mummy\" for much longer than most people do \u2013 and as no one is fully grown-up until both their parents are dead (so they say), I presumably remained a child well into old age. Certainly, I remained a child in her eyes \u2013 but then that goes with the territory of parenting. It goes both ways. Any of us can revert to the teenager we were if a parent pushes the right buttons. I was a \"bonded\" child. My mother held quite advanced views, for 1936, on bringing up baby. A bonding between mother and child was essential for the wellbeing and healthy development of the baby, and she determined that was how it would be between us. I don't argue with that and no child psychologist today would argue with it either. A strong, long-lasting attachment between a baby and mother, father, carer, or whoever, is the most important factor in infant development. So I was cherished, I was bonded. Bonding came naturally to Mother. Bonding was what she did. She had tried very hard to bond with my brother, born three years earlier, but he had demonstrated that he wasn't having any of it. He was pleased when I arrived, therefore, as it meant that the spotlight of attention moved from him to me. That was how he liked it. I was the bonding type. Mummy was my friend. My mummy was the best mummy in the world. I couldn't imagine having any other mummy. No one understood me like my mummy, no one laughed with me like my mummy and, most importantly, no one talked to me like my mummy. Because talk she did. All about her childhood, her mother, her father, her brothers and sisters, and the first world war. I enjoyed hearing about it. I couldn't get enough of it. She was perfect. She was Mummy. We had the war, we had doodlebugs, we had Hitler \u2013 but I was always going to be safe because I had Mummy (and Daddy, of course \u2013 but he came second); I was seriously ill but I got better because I had Mummy; we had the 1947 snow and ice for three months but it was fine because, when I got home, I had Mummy and she put my woollen gloves and socks on top of the boiler to dry so that they steamed and hissed. In the summer we had a heatwave and she made jugs of lemonade. But we all grow up and our perceptions alter. The adult I became found Mother much less perfect than the child had done. I realised that some of her opinions were racist, some were snobbish \u2013 all were ill-thought out. I didn't approve. She was also a damned nuisance \u2013 interfering in my life, worrying about my welfare incessantly and wanting to know every last detail of my existence so that she could worry about me further. She telephoned me daily, we met for shopping trips involving lengthy, conversational lunches \u2013 and every time we got chatty I let slip personal information I had intended to keep to myself. Why was this? I had no idea. I only knew that the habit of \"telling Mummy everything\" and \"always telling Mummy the truth\" was one I was unable to break. I regretted it instantly. But too late. I had given her another rope to reel me back in with. Another rope with which she could bond me. How could I lead an independent life if Mother was always part of it? She criticised my choice of friends, my hairstyle, my clothes \u2013 and, of course, any men I associated with were always unsuitable. We argued. She told me she wanted me to be happy. I told her she was possessive. She said she didn't have a daughter any more. I said she was being melodramatic. She cried. I told her to shut up. She told me I had turned into a horrible person. I cried. I said sorry. She said sorry. So it went on. Year after year. I married, I became a television producer, I ran a career. I retired. I got divorced. (\"I told you he wasn't suitable \u2026\") I married for the second time at the age of 68. (\"Make sure he looks after you \u2026\") I was a mature woman. In confidence and experience I had outstripped her. But I remained \"bonded\". I joked about it. \"It's fine being a bonded child \u2013 but when you are over 60 and still bonded to your mother you wonder what's going on.\" But I couldn't say, \"Listen, Mother, I don't agree with you over so many things; you may think we see eye to eye, but, frankly, we don't. I am not who you think I am. I am me and I don't want to be like you.\" When she reached 100 she began to worry about me again. \"You will be on your own when I die. When you're old, who's going to care for you? You won't have a daughter to look after you.\" \"Well, good,\" I said. \"That means no long-suffering female child will have to put up with my deafness, my demands, my irritability and the general strain imposed by the elderly on their young.\" But I wondered how I would feel when she did die. She made it clear that it was no fun being a blind, partially deaf centenarian. \"I keep hoping that when I wake up there won't be any me,\" was how she put it. At her age and with her health problems, she was in the \"death zone\". When it happened, how would I sort my feelings out? The affection, the disagreements, the anger \u2013 all jumbled up through the length of time we had been together and stirred into the conversations and the confidences we had shared. How would I be able to grieve? How would I find closure? Who would this dead person be? Mummy would be dead. Who was Mummy? I was too close to her to know. I did know that her brain and her heart were failing. I also knew I could not live with her and look after her. She knew that too. Uncomplainingly, she went into a care home. I made up my mind that it was time my bonds were broken; time for me to distance myself from her \u2013 to see her as a separate entity. To gain some perspective on her. I asked her to repeat some of the stories she had told me about her girlhood. Dementia made it difficult. She said: \"My poor mother \u2013 she had that terrible thing that came down and chopped her head off and she died. It was difficult for her to manage after that.\" But the more we talked, the closer I came to understanding. She was a product of her upbringing \u2013 as an Edwardian child \u2013 and her conditioning, as a suburban mother and housewife in the 1940s and 50s. I saw that the opinions I objected to were skin-deep \u2013 born of her background. I saw her as child, wife and mother and realised her identity was rooted in these. At 106 she started having falls. Her balance had gone. Every time I visited she was covered in bruises. It was \"end-stage dementia\". They took her to hospital where she lingered horribly because at first they tried to keep her alive. When finally they agreed to simple hydration, I held her hand in her last hours and, just for a moment, I licked the back of it, kitten-like \u2013 as I had done as a child for a joke. She half-smiled. The next morning she died. And I wept. But I had come to terms. I had worked it out. I grieved and I forgave, and I finally realised what the confusion of emotions was that we had felt for each other over 73 years. The resentment, the laughter, the anger, the affection, the attachment \u2013 the bonding.
