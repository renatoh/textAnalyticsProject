The 19-year-old from Northern Ireland, playing in his first tournament as a professional in the United States, was nonetheless pleased with the experience he gained in Arizona. \"Geoff played incredibly well and I needed to get birdies but it just wasn't enough in the end,\" McIlroy said. \"But I can take a lot out of this week. I played well and I've held my own against some of the best players in the world so it's been good.\" World No8 Ogilvy was the Irish teenager's first encounter this week with a top-10 player having previously knocked out Louis Oosthuizen, Hunter Mahan and Tim Clark on his professional debut on American soil. There was better news, however, for Paul Casey who became only the second Englishman to reach the last four of this event, emulating Ian Poulter in 2005, by beating American Sean O'Hair 4&amp;3 at the desert course near Tucson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
