The Guardian first spoke with Bangladeshi refugee Joinul Islam last month during the standoff at the decommissioned immigration detention centre at Lombrum when he said he feared for his safety if he was taken back to Lorengau. At the time Islam was still suffering from a damaged arm sliced open several months ago with a machete when he was attacked in Lorengau. It had not properly healed and promised follow-up surgery had not eventuated. Islam had gone days without sleep and without access to painkilling medicine when he spoke to the Guardian at the detention centre. \u201cI cannot go back there, I cannot go back. How can I go to Lorengau? I need a safe place,\u201d he said. He said he felt under intense pressure to quit Manus Island, abandon his protection claim altogether, and risk returning to Bangladesh. \u201cAll the time is pressure. My life is very difficult. I have been running five years.\u201d he said. Islam was forcibly removed to Lorengau at the end of the standoff between refugees and immigration authorities and his fears about returning there were realised on Monday when he was attacked at the town\u2019s market. The assault, in which he was hit in the face and had money and his phone stolen, has been reported to police. No one has yet been arrested. Pictures obtained by the Guardian show injuries to Islam\u2019s face, and him being transported on a stretcher. The attack on Islam comes at a time of increasing tension over the three accommodation centres built by the Australian government near Lorengau, the main town on Manus. The imposition of the transplanted refugee population in the small, familial community \u2013 in particular the building of the accommodation centres on customary land \u2013 has sparked protests across the town. The East Lorengau centre, the longest-standing of the three Australian-built centres, has been blockaded by landowners, who are protesting the centre\u2019s presence. On Tuesday, landowners used trucks, cars and a picket line to stop any staff from the Australian Border Force, PNG\u2019s immigration authority or subcontractors Paladin and JDA from entering the site. They put up signs warning staff to stay away, stopped food supplies getting in, and have threatened to attack refugees who try to leave. There are reports from the island that landowners are demanding millions of kina in compensation from the PNG and Australian governments. \u201cThe landowner is stopping even one person to leave the camp,\u201d one refugee said. \u201cI was having my medical appointment in general hospital but they threatened me with a knife \u2026 they told me, \u2018if you move outside of the gate, we will kill you\u2019. My friend and I were almost stabbed by them.\u201d Kurdish Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani, who is currently inside the East Lorengau centre, said the gates were blocked with two trucks. \u201cThe landowner is not happy with the companies working in the prison camps,\u201d Boochani said. \u201cAlready ... the landowner of East Lorengau camp warned Australian staff and case managers from Port Moresby that they must leave Manus soon.\u201d Boochani said the dispute was not related to refugees, but that they were suffering and at risk if the conflict escalated. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be dragged into this problem. The government must guarantee our safety. We respect the protesters but it\u2019s a problem we did not make. We are only watching the issue unfold because we are very worried about the conflict between the landowner, ABF and other companies escalating.\u201d The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been on Manus Island this month, and has issued a situation report of conditions on the island. It details security concerns \u2013 refugee accommodation has been repeatedly attacked, including by people carrying knives who have breached centre perimeters \u2013 as well as concerns over inadequate medical treatment, the abolition of torture and trauma counselling, and the absence of caseworker support. There are not enough showers and toilets in the accommodation blocks. In one accommodation block, five of the 11 toilets \u2013 for 150 people \u2013 did not work. Refugees in two of the three centres are also being supplied with untreated water, posing a potential health hazard. Accommodation is overcrowded and cramped, and there are no translators for refugees who do not speak fluent English, leaving them unable to seek proper medical treatment. According to the UNHCR, there are 801 refugees and asylum seekers held on PNG \u2013 between the three sites on Manus and Port Moresby; and 616 have been formally recognised as refugees. The UNHCR stressed that those who do not have refugee status are not \u201cnon-refugees\u201d but have not been granted formal protection because of mental health conditions, changes in their circumstances, or non-engagement with the Papua New Guinea refugee determination process. The UNHCR reiterated its call for Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime to be ended, and for durable solutions to be found for refugees on the two islands, who remain Australia\u2019s legal responsibility. \u201cLong-term solutions remain needed for all people transferred by Australia to Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Neither Papua New Guinea nor Nauru are appropriate places for local integration for the majority of refugees and asylum-seekers, particularly given their acute needs as a result of prolonged detention and harsh conditions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
