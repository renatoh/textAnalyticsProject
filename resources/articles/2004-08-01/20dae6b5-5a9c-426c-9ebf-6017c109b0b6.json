Not for me, thanks", "bodyText": "Welcome, dear Observer readers, to the second day of your bank holiday weekend. Or, a more fitting description, welcome to purgatory. Unless you are canny enough to be reading this in the international edition on some far-flung tropical beach, we welcome you to traffic delays on the Ms 1-347, cancelled trains, the uncomfortable couches of an airport departure lounge for your flight to nowhere fast, or to the quagmire commonly known as the Reading festival. Greet the three-hour check-out at the DIY superstore and the local refuse tip with a cheery grin and a doff of your cap, for it is the August bank holiday. Queues, queues and more queues. Speed restrictions, diversions and alternative routes aplenty. A shambolic long weekend of rail, road and air mayhem embraces you. Even worse, television is yours at the push of a button. Those who know what's good for them are staying at home, sealed in a self-enforced sensory-deprivation chamber, curtains, windows and emotions closed, with the TV off. Alone. Perhaps, in days of old, bank holidays were an altogether more enjoyable affair. Back then, when life was simpler, families packed themselves into their Austin Allegros and trundled down motorways empty of cars. Arriving at the seaside resortin record time, they unpacked their hampers beneath brilliant sunshine and settled back behind the windbreak for a joyous day out. But, unfortunately, modern life isn't like that. We demand more from our long weekends, desiring to travel further afield, squeezing in more home improvements, seeing more people... and the country becomes crippled. It is not as if this is some Boscastle-esque natural disaster, catching the nation unawares. It is not as if we didn't know this was coming. It started in 1871, when some bright spark introduced the Bank Holidays Act, meaning no trading could take place in financial establishments. Now England has eight, Scotland nine and Northern Ireland 10, each causing a mini maelstrom of chaos. The TUC is even calling on the government to give us three extra bank holidays, one at the autumn half term, one on national saints days and the final one on New Year's Eve. Either these people are mad or they are masochists. The argument behind the call for more bank holidays is to bring us into line with the rest of Europe. People on the Continent 'enjoy' an average of 11 constitutional days off per year. Portugal and Spain get up to 14 days' leave. Don't misunderstand me, I'm all for freebie days off (the more the better in my book) but I fail to see why we all have to take this communist-style day off en masse, bringing the entire country to a predictable halt in the process. Everything about bank holidays is so outdated, even the name. They should be renamed public holidays. We live in a 24-hour society where fewer people do the Monday to Friday nine-to-five grind. Modern lives are so haphazard that even banks recognise the need to tailor their services to suit us, hence the rise of phone and internet banking. How ironic that those for whom the holiday was invented - the banks - recognise the public's need for individuality, yet those behind the planning of bank holidays do not. One possible solution would be to add these enforced days off to our annual holiday entitlement, which would also mean the government would have to award every worker the legal right to them. This currently doesn't happen. At present, public holidays are awarded at the discretion of individual employers. Imagine the money it would save employers. No more taking sickies to watch the football in January. No more sudden and mysterious bouts of day-long flu on the short Wednesdays of winter. Take a public-holiday day and you could stay in bed guilt free. The World's Strongest Man/Woman/Pet would have to be put on more regularly to cope with demand, it's true, what with people staggering their breaks. But a teeny bit of future planning could have your mates arranging to take the day off, too, and with travel disruptions at a minimum, you could go somewhere and do something.
