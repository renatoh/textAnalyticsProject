It is a steep drop from the 20,000 students ministers estimated in May would start diplomas, and almost a quarter of the 50,000 originally expected. Opposition MPs said the diploma had \"flopped\". Ministers hope the diplomas will become the qualification of choice, above GCSEs and A-levels. But exam boards warned earlier this year of technical problems and a lack of training among teachers. Balls revealed the figure as he announced plans to take forward the government's reforms for 14- to 19-year-olds, of which the diplomas, designed to bridge the academic-vocational divide, are a key factor. Under the plans, schools and colleges will have to take on board the views of young people in their area when diplomas are being planned and delivered. Balls insisted that his department had received \"positive feedback\" from teachers and students on diplomas. Leading universities had now said they would consider applications from students with diplomas, he said, and the first independent school, Wellington College, was to offer the new engineering diploma in September 2009. The schools minister, Jim Knight, said the government had focused on \"quality, not quantity\" with the diplomas. \"We are making good progress, as last month's positive Ofsted report confirmed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
