The charity has suspended the building of boats and work on lifeboat stations but said its 238 bases remained operational and have been launching during the lockdown. The RNLI\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dowie, who is taking a 50% pay cut, said: \u201cWe have some reserves in place to deal with short sharp shocks to our financial situation. However, we are all facing unprecedented times and we have seen an immediate impact not just on our frontline services, but also on our ability to fundraise. \u201cWe have paused our ongoing planned replacement of equipment and buildings, such as lifeboat station rebuilds and building new lifeboats. We\u2019re also looking at new ways to fundraise online and on social media.\u201d Dowie said lifeboat stations continued to be busy, helping the likes of commercial fishermen, windfarm workers and people still going out on the water despite the lockdown. It has had to halt the recruitment and training of the 1,600 lifeguards who usually keep watch at 248 beaches, because they usually work in pairs and groups and because encouraging people to swim in certain areas goes against the lockdown and physical distancing. He said: \u201cIf someone presses the go button on the summer season with no notice it won\u2019t be possible to deliver the whole lifeguard network at the drop of the hat. It will take some time to ramp up again. We are focused on delivering the best services we can to the busiest beaches and are looking very closely at how we can do that.\u201d The furloughed employees will include trainers, workers who usually build new boats and support staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
