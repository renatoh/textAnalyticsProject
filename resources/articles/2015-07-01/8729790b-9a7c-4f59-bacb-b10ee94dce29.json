You can read our full news coverage of the Scott Walker presidential announcement here. Also be sure to read Ben Jacobs\u2019 just-published report, \u2018Scott Walker can be beaten. One woman did it. She\u2019s just sorry his career survived\u2019: Gwen Moore is the only person ever to beat the Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, in an election. The five-term congresswoman bested Walker in a 1990 state representative race in Milwaukee. She has one regret about that race, she says. She \u201cfeels tremendously guilty about not beating him well enough\u201d to end his political career. Nice-looking stage. Walker wraps up: That\u2019s why I love America. That\u2019s why we love America. That\u2019s why - working together - we can fight and win for America. God bless you. God bless our troops. And may God bless the United States of America Cue the Brooks &amp; Dunn. Life is a hiighway Walker moves toward the end of his speech with a litany of promises to \u201cfight and win for you\u201d: You see, It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re from a big city, a suburb or a small town, I will fight and win for you. Healthy or sick, born or unborn, I will fight and win for you. Young or old - or somewhere in between - I will fight and win for you. Walker announces that his family is running for president. No \u201cI\u201d, as in the prepared remarks -- onstage it\u2019s all \u201cWe\u201d: And so, after a great deal of thought and a whole lot of prayer, we are proud to announce that we are running to serve as your President of the United States of America. Here\u2019s the first chant of \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d from the crowd: We need to honor our men and women in uniform by giving them the resources they need to keep us safe - and then give them the quality and timely healthcare they deserve when they return home. But I believe that the best way we can honor them is by fighting to win. This is important because our goal is peace, but there will be times when America must fight. And if we must, Americans fight to win. The world needs to know that there is no better friend and no worse enemy than the United States of America. USA, USA, USA. Zoe Sullivan is in the expo center: Walker is on to foreign policy, not widely recognized as his strong suit, but he delivers these lines as convincingly as any candidate: \u201cThe greatest threat to future generations is radical Islamic terrorism and we need to do something about it,\u201d Walker says: That means lifting the political restrictions on our military personnel in Iraq so they can help our Kurd and Sunni allies reclaim land taken by ISIS. On behalf of your children and mine, I\u2019d rather take the fight to them than wait for them to bring the fight to us. We need to acknowledge that Israel is our ally and start treating Israel like an ally. There should be absolutely no daylight between our two countries. That\u2019s why I went to Israel earlier this year and met with both the Prime Minister and the opposition leader to express my wholehearted support for the unshakeable bonds between our two countries. Walker drops mention of the Laffer curve, arguing that lower taxes and a broader tax base would fund the government more effectively that higher taxes on the upper brackets. He says that\u2019s how the retailer Kohl\u2019s makes money its money \u2013 low prices, high volume. Do tax cuts increase revenues? Let\u2019s get back to that. Here\u2019s Walker: The government could charge the higher rates and a few of you could afford it. Or, we can lower the rates and broaden the base and increase the volume of people participating in our economy. Years ago, we saw this kind of plan work well under President Ronald Reagan. Back then, it was called the Laffer Curve. Today, I call it the Kohl\u2019s Curve because I believe that you can spend your own money far better than the government - and that will help grow the economy. \u201cWe need to lower the burden on hard-working taxpayers to give you your hard-earned dollar,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we need tax levels that are competitive for job creators to bring jobs back from overseas to put more of our fellow Americans back to work. \u201cWe can do it. We did it in Wisconsin and we can do it in Washington, too.\u201d What\u2019s your take on the Walker talk so far? Wooden? Or is that just the attractive wooden-plank backdrop? There\u2019s a dig at Obamacare: First, we must repeal ObamaCare. That\u2019s right, repeal the so-called Affordable Care Act entirely and put patients and families back in charge of their health care decisions - not the federal government. As Governor, I approved Wisconsin joining the lawsuit against ObamaCare on my first day in office. We need a President who - on the first day in office - will call on Congress to once and for all repeal Obamacare entirely. Walker comes very close to beating up on people who need public aid but may not want to take or be able to pass a drug test (he has signed legislation requiring drug screening for people who draw unemployment): In Wisconsin, we enacted a program that says that adults who are able to work must be enrolled in one of our job training programs before they can get a welfare check. Now, as of the budget I just signed, we are also making sure they can take a drug test. When I proposed this, the status quo defenders cried that we were making it harder to get government assistance. My response? No, we\u2019re making it easier to get a job. Walker says a culture of dependency has taken hold in the United States. Which reasoning would explain why he has been such a staunch opponent of living wage laws, raising the minimum wage, Medicaid expansion and a proponent of drug testing for recipients of unemployment. Sadly though, Washington seems to measure success by how many people are dependent on the government. Instead, we should measure it by just the opposite: by how many people are no longer dependent on the government. We understand that true freedom and prosperity don\u2019t come from the mighty hand of the government, they come from empowering people to live their own lives and control their own destinies through the dignity that comes from work. Walker touts his work to defund Planned Parenthood, liberalize gun laws and keep a lid on ...voting: Since I\u2019ve been Governor, we passed lawsuit reform and regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed Castle Doctrine and concealed carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote in the State of Wisconsin. All of those are applause lines. \u201cIf our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America. Here\u2019s the big line: To do this, we need new, fresh leadership; leadership with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington; the kind of leadership that can actually get things done - like we have here in Wisconsin. Since I\u2019ve been Governor, we took on the unions and won. Applause line. Not what you\u2019d necessarily call wild applause. But more than polite. Quietly wild applause. The candidate hops onstage to the rollicking hit \u201cLife is a highway\u201d by Rascal Flatts. Walker\u2019s wife, Tonette Walker, is telling the story of their courtship. \u201cMy first impression of the man I fell in love with and married was, \u2018Scott Walker is a guy who goes after what he wants\u2019,\u201d she says. Kleefisch is loud and rowdy. \u201cAmerica, are you ready to be vindicated!!\u201d The crowd cheers. \u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause he\u2019ll be out in just a minute.\u201d She turns to an intro video. Clear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose? You can watch a video feed of the Walker event here. Wisconsin lieutenant governor Rebecca Kleefisch is speaking. She is talking about the 2011 public-sector unions fight. \u201cIn a Herculean effort like a David to a Goliath, Governor Scott Walker had your back,\u201d Kleefisch says. \u201cAnd America, he will again.\u201d There are quite a few protesters on hand, it appears. Chris Christie wishes he could turn out this many consternated citizens: Here\u2019s a view from inside the Walker event, which will be emceed by the candidate\u2019s sons, Alex and Matt: Zoe Sullivan is at the Walker event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, talking to local supporters of the governor. Not everyone is on hand to show support for the governor, however. ABC News has an interview with the Walker family airing tonight. At a glance at this photo of the interview, can you distinguish the candidate from his sons Alex and Matt? (Hint: focus on the sideburns.) The sons, who were reported by their mother to have disagreed with the governor over his support for a constitutional amendment to block same-sex marriage, have written a testimonial to their father in the run-up to his announcement: To us, our Dad is just that, our Dad. He\u2019s just a regular guy. Like any other Dad, he embarrasses us. He still wears jean shorts and white ankle socks. He loves to sing karaoke and actually tells our friends that he\u2019s \u201ca singer.\u201d He even has a \u201cgo to\u201d song, \u201cStill the Night\u201d by the BoDeans\u2026 we think it\u2019s because there are so few lyrics for him to learn. Read the full thing here, while you listen to Still the Night, a nice tune: What do you think of the Scott Walker logo? On campaign signs it appears where the E in his name would be. It works for us. Very Tommy Hilfiger. Harry Enten of fivethirtyeight.com is rooting around in some new polling numbers pertaining to the Republican field, where presidential candidate Donald Trump has lately gone on a bit of a tear. A Monmouth University poll released Monday found that Trump had exhibited the largest post-announcement bump in the field, up 11 points from just two. The survey, conducted by telephone from July 9 to 12 with a sample of 336 registered voters who identified themselves as Republicans or Republican-leaning, had the top three rankings as Jeb Bush (15%), Donald Trump (13%) and Ted Cruz (9%). \u201cThe biggest poll bump over the past few weeks has been for Donald Trump,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, NJ. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to wonder if his support has already plateaued since many Republican voters don\u2019t view him as a serious candidate.\u201d Enten averages three live-interviewer polls since what he calls the Trump \u201csurge\u201d. Christie is not looking great: (h/t: @kaylaepstein) Here\u2019s where Scott Walker is going after he makes his big announcement tonight: As our live blog coverage of the day in politics continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, attacked the economic policies of three Republican rivals Monday. She accused Jeb Bush of being out-of-touch with American workers, she accused Marco Rubio of supporting a \u201cbudget-busting\u201d tax plan, and she accused Scott Walker of \u201cstomping on workers\u2019 rights with mean-spirited, misguided attacks.\u201d Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin planned an event for Monday evening in which he would tell supporters why he was running for president in 2016, as announced this morning on social media and in a web video. The AFL-CIO issued a six-word statement on the Walker candidacy: \u201cScott Walker is a national disgrace.\u201d Clinton laid out an economic plan calling for higher real wages, greater participation by women in the workforce, profit-sharing by corporations with employees, paid leave, child care support and tax credits for worker training. Clinton went after Wall Street villians, saying individuals responsible get off with limited consequences... and pocket the gains,\u201d while \u201ctoo big to fail is still too big a problem.\u201d She promised to introduce new regulations to \u201censure that no firm is too complex to oversee.\u201d Hillary Clinton today positioned herself as the defender of unions who will fight Republicans\u2019 \u201cmean-spirited, misguided attacks\u201d on workers\u2019 rights, writes the Guardian\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic (@kasperka): \u201cEvidence shows that the decline of union may be responsible for the third of the increase of inequality among men,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo if we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting union workers.\u201d Unions have warned that they would not automatically endorse Clinton in the 2016 election. \u201cWe are going to hold everyone to a single standard right now,\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in an interview with the Guardian earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talking about ending income inequality and how you have to raise wages and how they feel our pain. We are going to hold them to a standard that says: \u2018Ok, what are you going to do about it?\u2019 And Democrats, Independents and Republicans are going to have to answer that question for the American workers.\u201d To begin its formal process of selecting the candidate for its endorsement, the AFL-CIO has sent questionnaires to \u201cannounced and anticipated candidates\u201d. Clinton is among those who has filled out the questionnaire and has been invited to meet with the AFL-CIO executive council. Other invited candidates include senator Bernie Sanders, former governor Martin O\u2019Malley and former governor Mike Huckabee. She didn\u2019t wave a literal pitchfork but Clinton\u2019s attack on Wall Street thieves did have long needly tines. \u201cWhile institutions have paid large fines... too often it seems that the individuals responsible get off with limited consequences... and pocket the gains,\u201d she said. Will this endanger the healthy love on Wall Street for candidate Clinton? Or is it wink-wink nudge-nudge among people whose yearly incomes bounce around inside eight figures? The AFL-CIO has released a statement on the Scott Walker candidacy. It\u2019s short: (hat tip please to @kasperka) Last week, Republican candidate Jeb Bush said that, given that \u201cworkforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows,\u201d \u201cpeople need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families\u201d. Clinton took a swing at that softball today. Here\u2019s a transcription of what Clinton had to say about Bush (shorter version here): You may have heard Governor Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met many American workers. \u201cLet him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who is in that classroom, or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a lecture. They need a raise.\u201d In the interest of continuity between the Clinton event, just wrapped, and the Scott Walker announcement this evening, we wanted to go back and transcribe Clinton\u2019s comments about Walker more fully. Was it a coincidence that so many of the policy priorities outlined by Clinton \u2013 increased workforce participation by women, paid sick leave, child care support, equal pay, union health \u2013 read like a counterpoint to Walker\u2019s legacy in Wisconsin? She mentioned him by name only once: Alongside tax reform, it\u2019s time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers\u2019 rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks.\u201d Clinton winds toward her conclusion on the three points: \u201cstrong, fair and long-term growth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday,\u201d she says. Heckler! Somebody in the hall starts to harangue her right as she builds toward her rhetorical climax. The crowd claps and cheers the heckler down and out. Clinton smiles and wraps up: \u201cI want every child in the country \u2013 not just the granddaughter of a president, or a secretary of state \u2013 to live up to his or her god-given potential. Please join me in that mission. Let\u2019s do it together. Thank you all so much!\u201d She walks off the stage to \u201cBrave\u201d by Sara Bareilles. Clinton pivots to some pretty pointed talk about reining in Wall Street \u2013 the sharpest such talk we\u2019ve heard from her this cycle. In particular, she says that individual bankers, the people involved, have gotten off too easily for financial crimes. Then she says, \u201cunder my watch, this will change.\u201d Was that a promise to imprison white-collar criminals? It\u2019s a significant contrast with what Jeb Bush said on the issue last month: If people committed crimes, fine,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe\u2019re in year six of the recovery, and if they can\u2019t identify people that committed crimes, there may be a reason for it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Clinton\u2019s tack is the opposite. She lists examples of financial skullduggery: \u201cHSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money. Five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges... there can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior.\u201d Then she says the individuals get off too easily: While institutions have paid large fines... too often it seems that the individuals responsible get off with limited consequence... and pocket the gains. Clinton climbs to another promise to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d: \u201cI will appoint federal regulators that understand that too big to fail is still a big problem. We\u2019ll ensure that no firm is too complex to oversee.\u201d Clinton says short-term growth\u2013 which she says has been criticized as \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d \u2013 represents a false promise. Companies should not be plowing earnings into stock buybacks and other measures that generate an \u201cimmediate boost in share price.\u201d Then Clinton reveals that she\u2019s no Bernie Sanders, the erstwhile Socialist senator from Vermont and opponent to Clinton in the Democratic presidential nominating race: I\u2019m not talking about charity. I\u2019m talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many company have prospered by raising wages.. [increasing] productivity. ... Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off. Higher wages pay off. Training pays off. She mentions a $1,500 tax credit for companies for every worker they train and hire. Clinton on profit-sharing: Just before attacking Bush, Rubio and Walker, 1-2-3, Clinton passed through the section of her speech that had been billed as the day\u2019s marquee policy prescription \u2013 tax incentives to encourage corporations to direct a larger chunk of profits to workers. It was a one-line mention. Clinton groups the Republican candidates, whom she says all support tax plans that would give too much money to the wealthy and create new deficits. She singles out Rubio: Senator Rubio\u2019s plan would cut taxes on households that make around $3m a year by almost $240,000... that\u2019s a sure budget-busting giveaway, and that\u2019s the kind of bad economics you\u2019re likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side.\u201d She singles out Walker: Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their name stomping on workers\u2019 rights... I will fight back against these mean-spirited attacks.\u201d Clinton now tears into Jeb Bush, the Republican presidential candidate: You may have heard Governor Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met many American workers. Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day... to the fast-food workers who march in the streets demanding better pay. They don\u2019t need a lecture. They need a raise. Clinton says the path to economic growth is through fair pay, fair scheduling, paid family leave and child care: \u201cIt\u2019s time to recognize that quality, affordable child care is not a luxury, it\u2019s an affordable growth strategy,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end the outrage of women earning less than men on the job, and women of color making even less,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cI\u2019m aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women\u2019s issues,\u201d she says, but they are not. \u201cFair pay, fair scheduling, paid family leave and child care are essential to our competitiveness,\u201d she says. Clinton calls for making America the \u201cworld\u2019s clean-energy superpower.\u201d She is getting into a economics policy laundry list. \u201cI will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead,\u201d she says. Today she wants to focus on one goal: increased workforce participation by women. \u201cBreaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the American workforce \u2013 especially women.\u201d She says the US economy is \u201cleaving talent on the sidelines\u201d by not being more inclusive of women. She says family-friendly policies like paid leave have not been sufficiently implemented. Clinton says she will lay out a plan for strong growth and fair growth. Her first point on strong growth has to do with tax breaks for small business and closing tax loopholes that \u201creward companies for sending jobs overseas.\u201d Another key to strong growth, she says: comprehensive immigration reform. Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would grow GDP by hundreds of billions over ten years, she says. Clinton says the current US economy focuses \u201ctoo much on the short-term, like second-to-second financial trading and quarterly income reports.\u201d She says people are finding ways to generate second incomes by renting out rooms online or jumping into the Internet marketplace. \u201cThis on-demand or so-called \u2018Gig\u2019 economy is creating exciting opportunities... but it is also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThe defining economic challenge of our times is clear: we must raise incomes for hard-working American so that they can enjoy a middle-class life,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cAnd that will be my mission from the first day I am president to the last.\u201d Here\u2019s a video feed of the Clinton event: Clinton calls for a \u201cgrowth and fairness economy.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have one without the other,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need both.\u201d The question is, what does she mean by \u201cmore fairness\u201d? Corporate profits are at record highs, but \u201cpaychecks have barely budged in real terms,\u201d she says. She says wages have stagnated while child care costs and the cost of living have climbed. Clinton begins. Here she is: She says that government has broken a contract for prosperity with the American people. \u201cOur job is to make it strong again,\u201d she says. \u201cFor 35 years Republicans have argued that if we cut taxes... it will trickle down. \u201cYet every time ... [trickle-down] explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more\u201d and creates new economic crises, she says. \u201cTwice now, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind. I think the results speak for themselves.\u201d Update: video feed here. If you have a cable log-in you can momentarily begin watching Hillary Clinton talk about her economic vision in an event in Manhattan on C-SPAN here. If you don\u2019t have a cable login, you are in the right place, because we are going to bring you full non-video coverage right here. Here\u2019s some entertainment while we wait for secretary Clinton to speak at the New School. Retired late-night host David Letterman took the stage at the weekend with comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short to deliver a throwback Top 10 list: \u201cInteresting facts about Donald Trump\u201d: Good morning and welcome to your day of politics fun, to begin with a courtesy call from Hillary Clinton and end with the last of the Great Big Announcements of the 2016 presidential contenders (with apologies to John Kasich). Last in the pool (sorry Kasich) is Scott Walker, the impeccably conservative governor from Wisconsin, who is scheduled to materialize before a crowd of supporters this evening and say in the flesh what he said in a campaign video released early Monday morning: \u201cI\u2019m running for president to fight and win for the American people.\u201d Can Walker take his prizefighter-conservative act national? Click here to read 15 ways that Scott Walker has changed Wisconsin and could change America. The day begins, however, with Hillary Clinton in an appearance at the New School in New York to lift the curtain on her economic policy. She will call for tax incentives to encourage corporations to share more profits with workers, according to advance excerpts of her address. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d Clinton plans to say. Not only that \u2013 it\u2019s viscerally exciting. Don\u2019t miss it! Read on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
