Anne Olivier Bell, who grew up as \u201cAndy\u201d Popham before she married into Virginia Woolf\u2019s family, is the last survivor of a culture war \u2013 the Bloomsbury movement \u2013 that is now as venerable and remote as the Somme. Like that conflict, Mrs Bell \u2013 Olivier (pronounced \u201cOlivia\u201d) \u2013 is about to be a hundred years old. In the lee of the Sussex downs, just outside Charleston, which has become Bloomsbury central, this tall and serene old lady still lives in the red-brick cottage she shared with Quentin Bell, son of Vanessa, nephew and first biographer of Virginia Woolf. Her conversation is peppered with allusions to Leonard (Woolf), Maynard (Keynes), and Lytton (Strachey), and the walls of her cottage are decorated with the works of Roger Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Step into her parlour and you enter a vanishing world, peopled by the writers and artists who have shaped our lives: notably, her cousin Laurence Olivier, Peggy Ashcroft, Rupert Brooke, Laurie Lee, Kenneth Clark and the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis. Her own story begins with her Fabian Society parents and her earliest memories of a Wiltshire farm boy singing a popular favourite with Great War troops: \u201cK-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy, you\u2019re the only g-g-g-girl that I adore, when the m-m-m-moon shines, over the c-c-c-cowshed, I\u2019ll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.\u201d She breaks off to inquire if I know Jeremy Hutchinson, the celebrated barrister whose remarkable career is recalled in Thomas Grant\u2019s Case Histories. \u201cI saw him yesterday,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s a hundred and one.\u201d The very old are as age-competitive as the very young, and as free in conversation. \u201cI\u2019m very jealous of him,\u201d she continues. \u201cHe can walk, and he can talk, and do everything else I can\u2019t do.\u201d Whatever her frailty, her memory is as sharp as a quill, and her voice a strong quaver. As a young girl in the 1920s, she recalls being taken by her mother to stay with HG Wells (\u201cvery much a ladies\u2019 man\u201d), and impetuously sliding down the bannisters. \u201cHalf way down I fell off,\u201d she remembers, and smashed a priceless vase. \u201cThere was HG standing among the fragments,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut he was very nice indeed about it. He said, \u2018I\u2019m sure it was broken before, and we can get it mended\u2019. I was in floods of tears, and he took me off to play the pianola. Oh, such a very kind man.\u201d Bell\u2019s brushes with greatness punctuate her early years. She remembers auditioning for the St Paul\u2019s school choir with Gustav Holst. Later, she joined the newly established Courtauld Institute and was taught by Anthony Blunt, who she says she \u201cadored\u201d. (Another spy, Guy Burgess, instructed her family in the \u201cperfect cocktail\u201d, a mix of gin, Rose\u2019s lime cordial and ginger beer.) Her first encounter with Virginia Woolf \u2013 \u201cthis beautiful lady in a red silk dress\u201d \u2013 was actually in Bloomsbury, at a party given by the artist Benedict Nicholson. Then the second world war came and, like so many, she found her life turned upside down. She had fallen in love with an RAF pilot from South Africa, the artist Graham Bell (no relation to Quentin), but was now separated from him for months on end by the vicissitudes of war. In 1943, before they could marry, she was at her desk with the Ministry of Information when she received the official telegram she had dreaded: her lover was dead, killed in a flying accident. Bereaved and still single, Miss Popham seems to have become caught up in the bleak desperation of Home Front Britain. She and a flatmate shared second-floor rooms in Canonbury Square, London. Their neighbour was the cadaverous figure of George Orwell. \u201cI used to see him going down the path with his little boy [Richard Blair, Orwell\u2019s adopted son],\u201d she recalls. One day there came a note from Orwell, inviting her to tea. \u201cIn his flat,\u201d Bell continues, \u201cthere was a table, the baby, and its nurse. We had strong Indian tea, with brown bread and treacle. After tea, he told the nurse to take the baby away, and then he said, \u2018Come and sit on the bed\u2019. So I went and sat on the bed in the corner, and he came and sat beside me.\u201d She laughs in disbelief at the memory. \u201cIn no time at all, his arms were round me, and he was kissing me. I was shocked. I said, \u2018What are you up to ?\u2019 and I pushed him away. Later on, I decided this must be how Old Etonians got on with girls, as if no one could resist them. He said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and asked about my work, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m governing Germany\u2019.\u201d In November 1945, Bell had been approached by \u201ca foppish young man\u201d at a party who asked if she would be interested to join the Museums, Fine Arts and Archives branch of the allies\u2019 control commission in occupied Germany, a programme designed to rescue masterpieces of European art from the chaos of war. The devastation had been colossal. From Austria and Czechoslovakia to France and Italy, the invading Nazis had looted priceless treasures for the F\u00fchrer. She had accepted with alacrity. \u201cI was concerned about all the bombing and the destruction and the horror and the moving about of pictures.\u201d Back in Germany, she received \u201cquite a long letter from Orwell apologising for his behaviour, explaining that he, too, had recently been bereaved, and was looking for a wife\u201d. Bell, who subsequently gave the letter to the Orwell Foundation, resisted the opportunity to become the second Mrs Blair and returned to her work on the allied commission, serving as the only female officer among the \u201cMonuments Men\u201d. This allied team of some 300 art historians became responsible for supervising the return to their rightful homes of five million artworks seized for the planned F\u00fchrermuseum. Although she had been given the honorary rank of major, and served under a Slade professor, Bell\u2019s work and that of her colleagues received only a belated acknowledgement (an MBE) from the British government. Charles Saumarez Smith, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Arts, says: \u201cThere is a sense of embarrassment that the efforts made to preserve historic buildings and works of art were feeble in the light of the extraordinary levels of destruction allied bombers brought to German cities.\u201d In 2014 this vital cultural work became the subject of a Hollywood film, The Monuments Men, starring George Clooney and Cate Blanchett. Bell, who plainly revels in her friendship with Clooney, enjoyed the red-carpet treatment at the British premiere, but still treats her work with the Monuments Men quite matter-of-factly. Possibly the most fulfilling part of her long life came with her marriage in 1952 to Quentin Bell, Vanessa\u2019s son, and nephew of Virginia Woolf. Olivier \u2013 at first \u201cterribly nervous\u201d of Clive Bell and Duncan Grant and \u201cterrified by these clever people\u201d \u2013 formed a deep maternal alliance with Vanessa Bell. Her mother-in-law, she recalls, \u201cdelighted in anything ludicrous. I would stay up with Duncan and Vanessa and the two of them would have very easy conversation, not at all \u2018clever\u2019. They liked all the trivia and gossip.\u201d Through this renewed connection with Bloomsbury, Bell came to work on the Virginia Woolf papers, first as her husband\u2019s research assistant for his Woolf biography, and then, throughout the 1970s, as the editor of the five-volume edition of The Diary of Virginia Woolf, a monument of Bloomsbury scholarship that will stand forever. Does she have any regrets ? \u201cWell, my one regret is that I never asked Vanessa about her life when she was an upper-class girl in Kensington ...\u201d A beat. \u201cAnd I suppose I do regret not asking more about Bloomsbury.\u201d Bell\u2019s work on Woolf\u2019s diary, a classic of English literature, remains a source of great pride. \u201cThe diary is much more important to me than the monuments work,\u201d she says. Today Bell devotes herself to Bloomsbury business: Charleston, the Charleston Trust and its festival. Has she ever thought of writing her memoirs ? \u201cNo, no,\u201d she shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a writer.\u201d Who they were Name Taken from the then down-at-heel area in central London, where their evening salons were held.
