On Friday, the Canadian supreme court struck down three of these provisions as unconstitutional, deeming them incompatible with the rights of sex workers. The court ruled that three key pieces of legislation \u2013 against keeping a bawdy house; living off the avails of prostitution; and soliciting on public streets \u2013 endanger the nation's sex workers. Should it rise to the challenge, Stephen Harper's conservative government has just one year to draw up a new legal framework for Canada's sex industry. The women who brought the case to court \u2013 Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch and Valerie Scott \u2013 are delighted by the ruling, which they see as a step towards ensuring the dignity and safety of Canada's sex workers. I very much hope they're right: that any new legislation will be in keeping with the liberal spirit of Friday's judgment, and that a failure to legislate will not expose Canada's sex workers to exploitation. But I have qualms. It's highly unlikely that Harper will push for criminalising prostitution, as per, for example, the United States. This move would be contrary to the rights-based thrust of the ruling, and we'd soon end up back in court. But, realistically, with Harper at the helm, how permissive is Canada's new prostitution legislation likely to be? Just last month a conservative party convention in Calgary resolved to \"develop a Canada-specific plan to target the purchasers of sex and human trafficking markets through criminalising the purchase of sex as well as any third party attempting to profit from the purchase of sex\". This is basically the Nordic model, pioneered in Sweden, in which people paying for sex rather than prostitutes are criminalised. And I, for one, think it's ludicrous. The model has cut down on trafficking and street prostitution, sure, but a 2004 report suggests that it is making things more dangerous for prostitutes, who are now experiencing increased violence, lower payments and pressure to have unprotected sex at the hands of customers who are not afraid to engage in criminal activity. Here's the kernel of the problem: legislation seemingly focused on sex workers often has negative repercussions for the people it aims to protect. Canada's provision regards living off the avails of prostitution, for example, was originally intended to protect against parasitic pimps; in reality, it stopped women from hiring legitimate drivers and bodyguards, and put them at greater risk. But the kind of loosely regulated system that would result from a failure of the Harper government to legislate is no better option. In 2005, just five years after the Netherlands legalised prostitution with the goal of protecting sex workers, reports made plain that Amsterdam's ballooning red light district was a hotbed of criminal activity, coercion and violence. The Netherlands remains a major global destination for human trafficking. Germany's decriminalisation in 2002 also led to an increase in prostitution, and Germany too is now a focal point for human trafficking. Into all this doom and gloom I will insert the tale of New Zealand, where, since 2003, prostitution has been legal, but coercion is illegal, as is immigration to perform sex work and investment in the sex industry. In dialogue with prostitutes, the government developed a health and safety structure for the industry, meaning that anyone selling sex has a legal responsibility to use a sheath. In 2005, someone was even charged for slipping the condom off without a prostitute's knowledge. A report commissioned five years after the legislation showed that the sex industry still had many problems \u2013 stigma and violence among them \u2013 but there was no increase in prostitution, and sex workers were more empowered. Canada has the chance to do something groundbreaking here \u2013 to learn from experiments with liberalisation and legislation around the world, and to develop a new framework to protect and empower prostitutes while disenfranchising their would-be exploiters. But it may be too much to hope that Harper listens to voices from within the sex industry and, in the spirit of this supreme court ruling, helps to lift vulnerable sex workers out of the shadows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
