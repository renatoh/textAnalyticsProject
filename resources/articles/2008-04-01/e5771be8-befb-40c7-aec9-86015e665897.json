The three brought together here belong to the last 12 years of his life (Martin died in 1974), though strictly speaking the Passacaille for orchestra is an arrangement of an organ piece from the 1940s. They are linked by a debt to JS Bach, made explicit by a stylistic quote in the case of the Passacaille, which is built over a bass line that includes all but one of the 12 pitches in the chromatic scale; the debt is less direct in the two other works. The 1973 Polyptyque, for solo violin and two string orchestras, is an explicitly programmatic, six-movement commentary on scenes from the St Matthew Passion, in a style that seems a curious hybrid of densely expressive chromaticism and a more limpid tonality. The Maria-Triptychon, completed five years earlier, sets the three traditional Marian texts - Ave Maria, Magnificat and Stabat Mater - as a church cantata-like sequence of soprano arias with violin obbligato. Soprano Juliane Banse is perfectly suited to such vocal writing, and under Christoph Poppen, the strings of the German Radio Philharmonic sound wonderfully lustrous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
