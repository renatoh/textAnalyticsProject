Last year the first prize was $5m, easily the biggest purse in world sport. Today the organisers will announce how much this year's winner will get, and they are expected to pay more runners-up rather doubling the first prize - although that will certainly be bigger than the amount online qualifier Greg Raymer took home in 2004. With the huge entry split into three days of preliminary tournaments to shrink them into a more manageable 2,000 for the next round, there have been some shock eliminations, including the current No. 1 tournament money earner, Daniel Negranu and the top woman, Kathy Liebert. Gone, too, are Chris \"Jesus\" Ferguson and Jennifer Hartman, both once fancied to make the final table. The only big name among the top ten chip leaders after the first day was Layne Flack with $69,775 in chips, but even this was only half of the leader's stack of $145,800, which Lee Watkinson, a poker pro from Washington, will take into the next round. Top Briton was Carny Banin, a regular player in London card-rooms with $89,250, closely followed by John Falconer of Burnley ($87,875) and Nick Gibson from Windsor ($79,200). With women more prominent this year than ever, it's a British lady who leads that pack - Tiffany Williamson, a regular at London's Gutshot Club, with $80,200. What a double she might just pull off if she was the first Brit and the first woman to win the gold-and-diamond bracelet that goes with first prize! Another British woman doing well is Sarah Brinley ($45,150 ), along with Doug Speed ($50,475) and John Duthie who goes into Sunday's round with $38,225. Anthony Holden, The Observer's opera critic and author of the classic poker book, Big Deal, scraped in with $7,625 after a highly cautious first round. But crashed out are snooker champion Stephen Hendry and two of Britain's best players, Dave \"Devilfish\" Ulliott and Dave \"El Blondie\" Colclough. Also out is Lawrence Gosney, but he can console himself with the only British win in the preliminary World Series tournaments, having grabbed the Pot-Limit Omaha Crown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
