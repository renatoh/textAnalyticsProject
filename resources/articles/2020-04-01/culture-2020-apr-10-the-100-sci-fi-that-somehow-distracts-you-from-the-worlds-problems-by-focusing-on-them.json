Push through those though, and if you like it after that, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d This is something I have said about the science fiction series The 100 approximately the same number of times over the past five years. Without fail, a few days later I receive a message that says some variation of: \u201cUgh, fine, it isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Then about a week after that: \u201cI can\u2019t stop watching this show. How is it this good?\u201d I know that now doesn\u2019t seem like exactly the right moment to talk up a show all about a nuclear apocalypse that has rendered Earth unliveable, but please bear with me. It\u2019s worth it. In classic sci-fi form, The 100 is set in the not-too-distant future. All that remains of the human race is a small colony living on The Ark, a space station orbiting Earth. The idea is that humans will live there, die there, and reproduce there until Earth becomes inhabitable again. Life on The Ark is harsh: all crimes are met with capital punishment, food is limited, and worst of all it\u2019s running out of air. So the decision is made to send 100 of the population\u2019s juvenile delinquents down to Earth years earlier than planned. If they survive, great, everyone else can follow. If not, well, more air for those who remain. With the series about to enter its seventh and final season, you can take an educated guess at how well that goes. The show \u2013 once you push past the first three episodes \u2013 is like if Lord of the Flies were crossed with Firefly then reimagined as a soap opera. Also, as an added bonus, for an American show filmed in Canada it is very Australian. The cast has a surprisingly large number of Neighbours and Home and Away alumni, including Eliza \u201cJanae Timmins\u201d Taylor and Bob \u201cmy teenage self\u2019s favourite actor on Home and Away\u201d Morley. As the teenagers navigate a new world and tackle the challenges of both a hostile environment and essentially having to construct their own society from scratch, the writers are able to probe topics of real depth. On The Ark everything was punitive. Take extra food \u2013 get executed. Have more than one child \u2013 get executed. What, if anything, does this group of teens owe the people left back at their former home? Across the seasons The 100 digs into more complex territory. How can you decide if one life is worth more than another? Do you protect your own people at all costs? And then, just when you think it is all too real and feel the escapism of the show starting to get away from you, a giant mutant gorilla thing bursts through the jungle so unexpectedly that you can\u2019t help but laugh. Or you remember that the first episode featured someone saying, in earnest, \u201cWe\u2019re back, bitches!\u201d and everything is alright again. It\u2019s the perfect balance of dark and light. The 100 makes you ask big questions like: does being a strong leader mean giving up part of your humanity? And at the same time makes you ask practical questions like: where is everyone getting shampoo and blowouts? And with all this boning, why isn\u2019t everyone constantly pregnant? We have our own apocalypse to worry about right now, so why watch a show that is basically all about surviving the end of the world? Well, I could happily give you a hundred reasons, but I think the most compelling one is this: it\u2019s just very good television that will completely draw you in. It lets you think about important issues while keeping the real world at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s deep without being grim, and fun without being flippant. Filled with cliffhangers (sometimes literally), interpersonal dramas and the occasional gut-punch of a plot twist, it\u2019s an intelligently crafted, completely engrossing series that somehow manages to distract you from the world\u2019s problems by being all about the world\u2019s problems. \u2022 The first five seasons of The 100 are streaming on Netflix now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
