New research says the continent will experience many extreme outbreaks of intense rainfall over the next 80 years. These could trigger devastating floods, storms and disruption of farming. In addition, these events are likely to be interspersed with more crippling droughts during the growing season and these could also damage crop and food production. \u201cEssentially we have found that both ends of Africa\u2019s weather extremes will get more severe,\u201d said Elizabeth Kendon of the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre in Exeter. \u201cThe wet extreme will get worse, but also the appearance of dry spells during the growing season will also get more severe.\u201d This meteorological double whammy is blamed on the burning of fossil fuels, which is increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and causing it to heat up. Last month levels of carbon dioxide reached 415 parts per million, their highest level since Homo sapiens first appeared on Earth \u2013 and scientists warn that they are likely to continue on this upward curve for several decades. Global temperatures will be raised dangerously as a result. The new meteorology study \u2013 carried out by scientists at the Met Office in collaboration with researchers at the Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science at Leeds University \u2013 reports on the likely impact on Africa of these temperature rises and indicates that western and central areas will suffer the worst impacts of weather disruptions. Many countries in these regions \u2013 including Niger, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 are expected to experience substantial growth in population over that time and will be particularly vulnerable to severe floods. At the other end of the precipitation spectrum, the study revealed there would be an increase in occasions when severe drought would occur for up to 10 days in the midst of the most critical part of a region\u2019s growing season. The result could cause severe disruption to crop production. \u201cWe have been able to model \u2013 in much finer detail than was previously possible \u2013 the manner in which rainfall patterns will change over Africa,\u201d said Kendon. In the past it was thought intense rainfalls would occur in a region every 30 years. The new study, funded by UK foreign aid, indicates this is more likely to happen every three or four years. An example of such flooding occurred two weeks ago when it was reported that eight people had died south of Kampala in Uganda after torrential rain hit the region. Similarly, at least 15 people were reported to have died during floods in Kenya last year. Thousands lost their homes. \u201cOur research suggests that extreme bouts of rainfall are likely to be seven or eight times more frequent than they are today,\u201d said Kendon. The new research, which is published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, is based on forecasts of rainfall in Africa that were achieved by analysing weather patterns in great detail. \u201cAfrica is one of the parts of the planet that is going to be most vulnerable to climate change,\u201d said Kendon. \u201cOur study of rainfall patterns shows there are going to be some very severe problems to face food security and dealing with droughts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
