The past 12 months read like a backpacker\u2019s paradise but, for Jamie Day, those Asian countries equate to business, pit stops on his journey as the head coach of a cricket-mad nation: Bangladesh. For the majority of the last year Day has been in Dhaka, one of the world\u2019s densest cities, preparing his side for the 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins on Thursday against Laos \u2013 who are 184th in the Fifa rankings, four places above Bangladesh. \u201cYou associate Bangladesh with cricket and, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a big sport there but from what I have seen I would say football has the scope to be even bigger,\u201d Day says. \u201cThey love football but they have never been successful at it. I went to the Twenty20 games out in Bangladesh and there were probably 20,000-30,000 people there and we get similar: 30,000-40,000 at our games. \u201cIf you keep winning, like anything in sport, more people turn up and follow. I think football is probably more popular in Bangladesh than cricket but at the minute cricket is way ahead of football because it is more supported and gets more financial investment from sponsorship and things like that.\u201d After accepting the job last May, Day spent 14 weeks implementing a new training regime. One of the first tasks was to change his young squad\u2019s diet: bread, curry and dal were ditched. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic experience,\u201d says the 39-year-old, who started his playing career at Arsenal. \u201cWe had the Asian Games and now to be involved in a World Cup qualifier in which we potentially could get through to play Australia and Japan is something you dream of when you\u2019re coaching in the lower leagues. We are realistic but to get into that group stage and play against those kind of nations would be an unbelievable feat for Bangladesh.\u201d Before taking the role, he worked as the assistant manager at Barrow, in England\u2019s fifth tier. A former trainee at the beginning of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s reign \u2013 \u201cI was never going to get into the first team with Petit and Vieira in my position\u201d \u2013 Day also represented England at youth level against Ronaldinho before dropping into non-league with Dover Athletic, via Bournemouth, where he played with Eddie Howe and lived in digs with Howe\u2019s assistant, Jason Tindall. Those days are a world away from the sweltering Bengali heat. \u201cWe train at 6am or 7am and 5pm to cope with that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a full-on, hectic place. The drainage is not great so, when it rains, everywhere gets flooded. There\u2019s loads of traffic \u2013 it can take an hour to travel two miles \u2013 and you can be driving down the road and you\u2019ll have three or four cars coming towards you from the opposite side. It\u2019s a very busy, very crowded city and it can be difficult to just walk down the street.\u201d That task gets even harder when locals stop and ask Day for a selfie amid the hullabaloo of Dhaka. \u201cIt is very different to England, where no one has a clue who I am. Because of the amount of press and TV channels, people do recognise me and want photos. It still makes me laugh but I enjoy it.\u201d The hardest part of the job is being away from his wife, Keely, and his four sons, Harry, Louis, Jesse and Tyler. \u201cI probably see the children every four to six weeks, which is not ideal, but in football you have to make sacrifices sometimes and we felt this was a good one to make to try and develop further. At some stage it would be nice for them to watch a couple of games. It would be nice for them to experience the experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d Day is determined to improve the infrastructure behind the scenes and admits sometimes not everything goes to plan. \u201cWe have turned up to hotels and not had enough bedrooms for the players, times when we have not had enough bibs and times when the grass has not been cut on the pitches so we haven\u2019t not been able to train. They are just little things that all add up. We\u2019ve been on the coach and had to get off because the driver didn\u2019t have a licence. We came out of the airport and got stopped and the players had to get Uber cabs back to their clubs from the airport. It was no fault of the BFF [Bangladesh Football Federation]; they were told everything was fine and obviously it wasn\u2019t. It was frustrating at the time but when you look back you laugh about it.\u201d Born in Sidcup, Day estimates his squad \u2013 all of whom play for clubs across Bangladesh \u2013 understand 70% of his English instructions and, therefore, he works with an interpreter. Scouting trips have enabled him to explore his surrounds, including Sylhet, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Cox\u2019s Bazar, home to the longest natural sea beach in the world. There is scope to call up eligible players from the Essex Senior League club Sporting Bengal, as well as others based in the United States and Sweden. As for Day, a former Ebbsfleet and Welling manager who admits \u201cdoors can shut very quickly in England on the back of one bad experience\u201d, he is savouring the opportunity to prove himself on the world stage and allow a population of nearly 170 million to dream."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
