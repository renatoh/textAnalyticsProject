Biggest disappointment The French disconnection. Favourite game The final, naturally. Golden goal Ronaldinho's run and pass and Rivaldo's superbly executed shot when Brazil drew level with England. Quote of the tournament \"Eriksson talks about pace but nothing can run faster than the ball\" - Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Brazilian coach, after his 10-man team had beaten England. My World Cup XI Marcos (Brazil): Puyol (Spain): Ferdinand (England), Ramelow (Germany), Pope (United States), Ortago (Argentina), Ballack (Germany) Ahn Jung-Hwan (South Korea), Ronaldinho (Brazil): Rivaldo (Brazil), Ronaldo (Brazil) Richard Williams Player of the tournament Ronaldo, for the pleasure of seeing a great player rediscover more than a semblance of his former self. Biggest disappointment The sad sight of Paolo Maldini missing the last, crucial header of a magnificent international career. Favourite game France 0 Uruguay 0 The first winners and the last put on an unexpected epic full of desperate hand-to-hand combat. Golden goal Edmilson against Costa Rica - a pair of one-twos followed by an improvised bicycle kick from the tournament's most original player. Quote of the tournament \"Apart from Kahn, you could put that lot in a bag and beat it with a stick and whoever got hit would deserve it.\" - Franz Beckenbauer on Germany, after their 1-0 win over South Korea. My World Cup XI Rustu Recber (Turkey); Finnan (Republic of Ireland), Lucio (Brazil), Edmilson (Brazil), Ashley Cole (England); Song Chong Gug (South Korea), Wilmots (Belgium), Khalilou Fadiga (Senegal); Raul (Spain), Ronaldo (Brazil), Ronaldinho (Brazil). Ron Atkinson Player of the tournament Ronaldo, to come back as the World Cup's leading scorer and get two in the final shows phenomenal character. Biggest disappointment England's failure to show enough quality, drive or belief when they could have had a 10-man Brazil on the ropes in their quarter-final. Favourite game Germany v Brazil, which was the final the tournament deserved and the best since 1982. Golden goal Ronaldo's second yesterday. It was vintage Brazil, passing and passing before Ronaldo provided a great finish. Quote of the tournament That infamous Beckenbauer quote: (see above) My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Song CG (South Korea), Ferdinand (England), Hierro (Spain), Roberto Carlos (Brazil); Okocha (Nigeria), Hamann (Germany), Ballack (Germany), Fadiga (Senegal); Ronaldinho (Brazil); Ronaldo (Brazil). Danny Mills Player of the tournament From an England perspective, my Leeds team-mate Rio Ferdinand elevated his status to world class with a near faultless display, but I think Ronaldo's performances have justified his tag as the best striker in the world. Biggest disappointment Naturally our exit still rankles with me; having taken the game to Brazil, two goals either side of half-time had us chasing the game and we failed to respond in the way that we'd wished. Still, there is some consolation in the fact they we lost to the eventual winners. Favourite game The victory against Argentina gave me particular satisfaction. The World Cup history between the two countries is well documented, so to walk off the pitch and see the 1-0 result on the scoreboard was a fantastic feeling. Golden goal Dario Rodriguez's volley for Uruguay in their opening game against Denmark. From a cleared corner, the ball was controlled and touched on for him to volley spectacularly into the top corner. I don't think the ball touched the floor throughout the move. Quote of the tournament \"Where's the chessboard?\" - Sol Campbell on our arrival at Awaji Island. My World Cup XI It would be wrong for me to single out players from our camp, and Mick McCarthy's squad for that matter, so here is my non-England and Ireland XI. Rustu (Turkey); Hong Myung Bo (South Korea), Linke (Germany), Hierro (Spain), Carlos (Brazil), Sas (Turkey), Rivaldo (Brazil), Ballack (Germany), Okocha (Nigeria), Ronaldo (Brazil), Klose (Germany). Ron Manager Player of the tournament Cannigia! - end of story. Biggest disappointment .. Er well to be fair ... all a bit \"family-orientated\" wasn't it hmm? no water cannon? no riot-shields? ... lets be honest, its not really football till it all kicks off hmm? Favourite game Ho ho beach volley-ball isn't it? ... enduring image hmm? ...Only joking ... of course its bloomin' football isn't it? ... marvellous Golden goal Rio Ferdinand isn't it? ... sheer tenacity! ... as the goalie plucks his tame header out of the air and flings it into the net, he seizes the opportunity! After 3 days of harrying the Fifa bigwigs ... \"Ferdinand... GOOoooaaaaal!\" Quote of the tournament ..\"pear-shape, pear-shape, pear-shape,\" My World Cup XI Seaman, Wan Long Punt, Bejabers, Socrates, Rivelino, Rondivaldhinho Papa Booboo, Thumbelina , Muzzard Izzard , Hugh Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert Dibble and Grubb Michael Walker Player of tournament Ronaldo Biggest disappointment Italy's attitude Favourite game France v Uruguay Golden goal Rivaldo's v England Quote of the tournament \"For the third goal I blame the ball\" - Saudi keeper My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Puyol (Spain), Ferdinand (England) Edmilson (Brazil); Schneider (Germany) Wilmots (Belgium) YP Lee (South Korea) Duff (Republic of Ireland); Ronaldo (Brazil) Ronaldinho (Brazil) Dominic Fifield Player of the tournament Hasan Sas. The effervescent performer behind a largely disappointing Hakan Sukur inspired the Turks to reach the semi-finals. Biggest disappointment France. The defending champions and favourites were supposed to have added firepower to the finesse of four years ago. They didn't even manage a goal, whingeing out at the first stage after barely mustering a whimper. Favourite game Senegal 3 Uruguay 3. The Dakar Lions needed a point to qualify and were rampant, roaring into a three-goal lead at the interval. Uruguay had to win themselves and promptly roared back to parity, only for Richard Morales to miss an open goal in injury-time that would have put them through. Golden goal Edmilson against Costa Rica. Starting deep inside his own half, he exchanged one-twos with Rivaldo and Junior before twisting to pummel a stunning scissor-kick volley into the corner. Quote of the tournament \"We have adapted well to life without Zinedine [Zidane]. As far as our fans are concerned, we have to win the World Cup. They'll be after my blood if we don't, but this is a great France team.\" -Roger Lemerre, France's coach, after the goalless draw with Uruguay left them bottom of Group A: My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Ferdinand (England), Hong Myung-bo (South Korea), Metzelder (Germany); Inamoto (Japan), Reyna (United States), Papa Bouba Diop (Senegal), Duff (Republic of Ireland); Sas (Turkey); Rivaldo (Brazil), Ronaldo (Brazil). Daniel Taylor Player of the tournament Ronaldo. As John Motson said: \"In 1998 he had a seizure, in 2002 he seizes the moment.\" Biggest disappointment Roy Keane's refusal to say sorry. Favourite game South Korea 2 Italy 1. South Korea showed themselves to be great winners while Italy were terrible losers. Golden goal Ahn Jung-hwan's winner for South Korea against Italy. An Italian journalist in the press box had sung his own tune during the Korea national anthem - he did not look so clever after 117 minutes in Daejeon. Quote of the tournament \"He said to us: 'You all go with the flow.' \"I thought: 'Here we go again.' He'd been hammering me with one-liners all week. I asked him: 'What goes with the flow?' 'Dead fish,' he said. I thought: 'Wow! P-R-O-F-O-U-N-D! The Messiah has spoken.\" - Jason McAteer on Roy Keane. My World Cup XI Casillas (Spain); Cafu (Brazil), Lucio (Brazil), Hierro (Spain), Metzelder (Germany); Ronaldinho (Brazil), Michael Ballack (Germany), Ivan Helguera (Spain), Damien Duff (Republic of Ireland); Ronaldo (Brazil), Rivaldo (Brazil). Jim White Player of the tournament Michael Ballack. His response to being booked in the semi and thus suspended from the final was the magnificent antithesis of blubbing self-pity. Won't win him any commercial endorsements, however. Biggest disappointment Apart from the French, the Italians, the Portuguese and the Argentinians, it was England's limpness in defeat by Brazil. Favourite game Ireland's last-minute recovery against Germany. If nothing else, it showed England what spirit can deliver. Golden goal Diego Forlan for Uruguay v Senegal. You knew it was an odd World Cup from the moment Forlan got a goal. Quote of the tournament \"I think the conditions suited them more than us.\" - Mark Kinsella after Ireland's rain-drenched victory over Saudi Arabia. My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Cafu (Brazil), Myung Bo Hong (Korea), Ferdinand (England), Roberto Carlos (Brazil); Inamoto (Japan), Ballack (Germany); Duff (Ireland), Ronaldo (Brazil), Rivaldo (Brazil), El Hadji Diouf (Senegal). Martin Kelner Player of the tournament Oliver Kahn, single-handedly (with the help of the other hand, feet, knees, chin etc.) kept Germany in the tournament. Biggest disappointment Sven-Goran Eriksson's inability to change tactics against Brazil changed the Friday morning atmosphere in school halls across the nation from carnival to double maths. Favourite game England v Argentina - as above, in reverse. Golden goal Salif Diaio, for Senegal v Denmark. Great team goal. Quote of the tournament \"You would think if any team could put up a decent wall it would be China.\" -Terry Venables on China's shambolic defence of free-kick My World Cup XI Khan (Germany); Hong Myung-bo (S Korea), Puyol (Spain) Ferdinand (England) Nesta (Italy); Sas (Turkey) Inamoto (Japan) Al Temyat (Saudi Arabia) Duff (Ireland); Diouf (Senegal) Ronaldo (Brazil) Harry Pearson Player of the tournament Rivaldo. Great skill, terrible acting and the bandiest legs since Charlie Chaplin - a one-man circus. Biggest disappointment The free-kicks. How many times do we have to watch Roberto Carlos, Francesco Totti and Co blast the ball into the stands before someone tells them to stop? Favourite game Brazil v Costa Rica. Watching it over breakfast revived dewy-eyed memories of Mexico '70. Golden goal Salif Diao for Senegal v Denmark. The kind of quickfire, sweeping move normally only see in Roy of the Rovers. Quote of the tournament: We sacrificed 1,000 soldiers to defend the South Koreans and one Korean has killed 70m Turks - Haluk Ulusoy, president of the Turkish FA, keeps a sense of perspective. My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Cafu (Brazil) Ferdinand (England) Hong (South Korea) Edmilson (Brazil) Emre Belozoglu (Turkey) Schneider (Germany) Wilmots (Belgium) Papa Bouba Dioup (Senegal) Rivaldo (Brazil) Ronaldo (Brazil). Vivek Chaudhary Player of the tournament Hong Myung-bo (South Korea). An inspiration to his team and country who single handedly epitomised the spirit shown in the tournament of the underdog. Biggest disappointment The atmosphere inside Japanese stadiums because of the way they were constructed. Too much space between the stands and the pitch. Favourite game Turkey against Senegal. A captivating, open, end-to-end contest that was littered with chances and skill. Golden goal Ronaldinho's free-kick against England. A superb piece of impromptu skill for a goal that was clearly intended. Quote of the tournament \"Which group are India playing in and what are their chances of winning the world cup?\" - South Korean talking to me about football in Seoul. My World Cup XI Rustu Recber (Turkey); Roberto Carlos (Brazil); Alpay Ozalan (Turkey); Hong Myung Bo (South Korea); Rio Ferdinand (England); Ronaldinho (Brazil); Rivaldo (Brazil); Inamoto (Japan); Ballack (Germany); Ronaldo (Brazil); El Hadji Diouf (Senegal). Jon Brodkin Player of the tournament Ronaldo. Not just for his goals but for confirming his recovery from serious knee problems. After the misery of the final of France '98, yesterday was just perfect. Biggest disappointment Rivaldo's behaviour in Brazil's first match against Turkey when he pretended to have been hit in the face to get an opponent sent off. Favourite game South Korea 2 Italy 1. For the sheer scale and drama of the upset, helped by South Korea's goals coming in the 88th and 117th minutes. Golden goal The header by Ahn Jung-Hwan which knocked out Italy. Not the most beautiful but unbeatable for the emotion it provoked from Koreans and Italians. Quote of the tournament \"I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football\" - the Perugia president Luciano Gaucci takes Ahn's winning goal in the best spirit. My World Cup XI Kahn (Germany); Puyol (Spain), Ferdinand (England), Ramelow (Germany), Roberto Carlos (Brazil); Duff (Ireland), Ronaldinho (Brazil), PB Diop (Senegal), Sas (Turkey); Diouf (Senegal), Ronaldo (Brazil).
