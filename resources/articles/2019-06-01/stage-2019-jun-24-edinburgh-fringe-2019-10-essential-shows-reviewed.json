A subversive feminist musical, with elements of pop video, horror movie, art installation and therapy session, it chronicles the moment in 2015 when she broke up with her boyfriend, lost her mind and very nearly lost her baby. A choking and exhilarating ride. MG Read the full five-star review Jessie Cave: Sunrise Assembly George Square Studios There\u2019s intimate standup comedy, and then there are Jessie Cave\u2019s shows: animated diary entries tracing the ebb and worrisome flow of her sex life, her self-esteem and her feelings for her ex and father of her kids, fellow comic Alfie Brown. This is a potent, grownup and emotionally intelligent hour of heart-on-sleeve comedy. BL Read the full four-star review Juliet and Romeo Dance Base The clever conceit of Ben Duke\u2019s funny but achingly sad revision of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy is that the formerly star-crossed lovers (Duke and Sol\u00e8ne Weinachter) are approaching middle age. They are embarking on a memory exercise in which they relive key moments of their lives. It is beautifully assured: fast, inventive, smart and expertly paced. JM Read the full five-star review The Fishermen Assembly George Square Studios Based on Chigozie Obioma\u2019s Man Booker prize-nominated 2015 novel, Gbolahan Obisesan\u2019s script for The Fishermen strips the stage of the book\u2019s many characters. Instead we are given a speedy two-hander that pulls humour and heartache from an ambitious story that is half flashback-heavy Bildungsroman, half Achebe-esque family tragedy. BM Read the full four-star review It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True Underbelly Breach Theatre\u2019s tremendous three-hander evokes the 1612 trial of Agostino Tassi, accused of rape by Artemisia Gentileschi, a gifted baroque painter who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack. It uses period transcripts, translated from Latin and Italian into conversational English, as the raw material for a gripping court drama driven by implicit feminist rage. MF Read the full four-star review Fake News Assembly George Square Studios In Osman Baig\u2019s punchy, provocative monologue, the audience play interns to whom Baig, as a senior editor, delivers an induction lecture on \u201cjournalistic integrity\u201d. We are invited to learn from his catastrophic fact-checking error over a piece of breaking news that almost broke the internet. Such is his energetic intensity he seems to deliver the entire performance in a single breath. ML Read the full four-star review Rose Matafeo: Horndog Pleasance Courtyard This is a history of the New Zealand comic\u2019s brushes with love and sex. Having kissed nine people in her life (she\u2019s 26), that easily fits into a fringe hour. And what an hour it is: another storming set from a woman whose neuroses, intelligence and flamboyant sense of her own ridiculousness make her a near-perfect comedian. BL Read the full four-star review BalletBoyz: Them/Us Underbelly BalletBoyz has metamorphosed from the founding duo of Michael Nunn and Billy Trevitt to a seven-strong group who are not only dancers but \u2013 on the evidence of Them, the first half of this double bill \u2013 budding choreographers too. It was devised democratically by the company and is thoughtful, fresh and finessed. The second half, Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s Us, reaches deep into two men\u2019s connection. LW Read the full four-star review Status Assembly George Square Chris Thorpe\u2019s one-man show is about the questions of nationhood that the divisive Brexit referendum and the impending split from Europe throw up. With its magical-realist twists, the show has the strange pull of a Haruki Murakami novel; it\u2019s a dense and provocative barrage of reflections on a world in flux and our place within it. MF Read the full four-star review Frankenstein: How to Make a Monster Traverse The Beatbox Academy is a collective born from the Battersea Arts Centre, with members ranging from nine to 29 years old. Mary Shelley\u2019s novel is used as the loosest of frameworks to explore issues of identity, body image and social media. The space throbs with unimaginably complex harmonies and beats. It beggars belief: could this really be just six people with microphones? MG Read the full five-star review"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
