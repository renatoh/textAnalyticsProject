Syed\u2019s case, which garnered international attention from the podcast Serial, was among the first to use such analysis and the interpretation of the 1999 records is in dispute. The hearing will continue Monday. Syed\u2019s team interrupted their own case to accommodate the schedule of a prosecution witness \u2013 FBI special agent Chad Fitzgerald \u2013 who testified that the cellphone analysis used in the original case \u201cwas the kind of analysis we still do in 2016\u201d. In a lengthy cross-examination, however, he appeared momentarily flummoxed when Syed\u2019s attorney showed him records that indicated a single caller purportedly had managed to travel between Woodlawn, a Baltimore suburb where the murder occurred, and Washington DC which should be an hour away, in less than half that time. Calling into the question of validity of cellphone records, he said such speedy travel wouldn\u2019t be possible \u201cunless Mr Syed had a helicopter\u201d. Syed was granted the hearing in part because of a cover letter that accompanied the cellphone records saying that incoming calls were not to be relied on for location, even though it was precisely such calls that placed Syed at the park where Lee was buried. David Irwin, a defense attorney, testified as an expert witness on the legal obligation to contact and investigate potential alibi witnesses, declaring that an alibi \u201cis the best possible defense you can have\u201d. He said not investigating the claims of Asia McClain, now Chapman, who said she was in the library with Syed when the murder occurred, was a serious ethical lapse, saying that such an investigation \u201cwas mandated as well as important\u201d. In a letter Chapman wrote to Syed shortly after his arrest, she claimed that she had called the library and was told they had a security camera. Irwin said this added to her trustworthiness because a liar would not seek verification. But the state\u2019s lawyer Thiru Vignarajah had tried to discredit Chapman\u2019s testimony by claiming the library did not have cameras at the time. That claim was refuted by Michelle Hamiel, a librarian at the time, who helped manage the surveillance system. The courtroom was packed with supporters of Syed and fans of the podcast Serial, which followed his case, until the judge declared a weekend recess around 5.30pm, saying the hearing would reconvene on Monday in order to finish Fitzgerald\u2019s testimony and then return to the defense case. The state will then continue to present its own witnesses. The judge will issue a written opinion, rather than ruling from the bench so no decision is expected immediately following the conclusion of the hearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
