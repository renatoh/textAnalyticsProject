Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a detailed summary of the day\u2019s events: And, for those wanting to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jim Waterson have tonight\u2019s main politics story: \u201cYes, what was that?\u201d said Boris Johnson, affecting bafflement when asked about the Conservative party\u2019s Twitter feed masquerading as a fact-checking service during the debate on Tuesday between the party leaders. The prime minister appeared to be suggesting his own party\u2019s official communications channels had nothing to do with him; he argued it was not for him to \u201cinvigilate absolutely everything\u201d on the internet. Read my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s report from the Tory campaign trail: A complaint from the Labour Party over Sky News\u2019 decision to brand this contest the \u201cBrexit Election\u201d has been rejected by the media regulator, Ofcom. Labour are keen to fight the election on other policies such as the NHS, arguing that the presence of on-screen Brexit election branding showed bias. Ofcom rejected this claim in a letter sent on Tuesday afternoon, telling the party: We considered that Brexit is an important background contextual factor which has been instrumental in shaping the debate within Parliament in the weeks and months leading up to the general election. In addition, given that the current extension to the article 50 process runs out on 31 January 2020, the issue of what happens next in terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will be determined by the election result and the make-up of the next parliament. Against this backdrop, we consider it a reasonable editorial judgment for Sky News to use the strapline \u2018The Brexit Election\u2019 to label its election programming. Some hasty revisions have been made to Boris Johnson\u2019s equally hasty announcement of a national insurance (NI) contributions cut (see 2.11pm). At first, the prime minister said the Tories were going to increase the threshold at which most workers begin paying NI to \u00a312,000. Later, speaking to ITV News, he said the initial increase would actually only be to \u00a39,500, while a subsequent rise to a new figure of \u00a312,500 was described as an \u201cambition\u201d. That first change to NI, he wrongly claimed, would represent a \u201c\u00a3500 cut for every working person\u201d. The latest version of the policy released by Tory HQ this evening is a lifting of the NI threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 in 2020/21, which the party now says will actually only be worth \u00a3100 per worker \u2013 or less than \u00a32 per week \u2013 and an \u201cultimate ambition\u201d to increase it to \u00a312,500 at some point in the future. Waheed Rafiq, the Lib Dem candidate in the Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency, has been suspended from the party for making \u201cclearly and unambiguously antisemitic\u201d comments on social media. The timing is potentially awkward for the Lib Dems, coming on the same day as the party\u2019s manifesto launch. A Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said: \u201cAt 3pm Waheed Rafiq Hodge Hill PPC (prospective parliamentary candidate) was suspended from the party. \u201cThe public posts on his Facebook and Twitter account from 2010 to 2014 are clearly and unambiguously antisemitic and bring the party into disrepute and are also of material disagreement with the fundamental values and objectives of the party.\u201d Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cThe only response to the disgusting antisemitism exhibited by the Liberal Democrat candidate for Birmingham Hodge Hill is to immediately drop him as a candidate for the constituency. \u201cWe call on the Liberal Democrats to act now and ensure he is expelled after he is dropped as a candidate.\u201d Earlier, the prime minister claimed a new pledge to increase the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,000 was part of a plan to primarily help \u201cworking people\u201d (see: 2.11pm). But does it stack up? Here\u2019s our factcheck, put together by my colleague Richard Partington: The Resolution Foundation said the threshold hike was \u201crelatively progressive as far as tax cuts go\u201d, but that to reduce poverty it would be better and more cost effective to reverse the \u00a312bn in benefits cuts imposed under austerity policies since 2015. Listen in to this week\u2019s Politics Weekly, as my colleague Heather Stewart is joined by Ayesha Hazarika, Paul Harrison and Will Jennings to pick apart the ITV debate. Plus, Rowena Mason calls in from the Tory battlebus and Peter Walker reports from the Green party\u2019s manifesto launch: Jo Swinson has launched her party\u2019s manifesto at an event in Camden. She said the Lib Dems were the only ones who could take a significant number of seats from the Conservatives and deprive them of a majority. In a speech to activists, she highlighted the party\u2019s policies on the environment, education and childcare. You can read our report on the manifesto here. She said: At this election the future of our country is at stake. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that is doesn\u2019t get better than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, that we are destined to stand alone in the world, that we must face the biggest challenges on our own, that Brexit is inevitable. None of that is a given. The future of our country is in our hands and we can make a better choice, so it you want to stop Boris Johnson and stop Brexit, vote Liberal Democrat. She wraps up: \u201cThe future of our country is in our hands ... so if you want to stop Boris Johnson and stop Brexit then vote Liberal Democrat. If you want a \u00a350bn bonus to improve your life, vote Liberal Democrat ... If you want to work with our friends to tackle the climate crisis, vote Liberal Democrat. If you want to build a brighter future, vote Liberal Democrat.\u201d The biggest investment in the manifesto is for parents, says Swinson, something she is very proud of. They will help parents going back to work by providing 35 free hours of childcare a week, for 48 weeks a year. \u201cWe are the only party that can win a significant number of seats from the Conservatives and deprive them a majority,\u201d says the Lib Dem leader. She says her party has committed \u00a311bn over the next five years for improvement of mental health services \u2013 investing more money in talking therapies and increasing the number of mental health nurses. Swinson says hers is the only party with a credible plan to tackle the climate emergency. \u201cWe will not leave our party with a boiling planet,\u201d she says. Stopping Brexit will give them the money to reverse schools cuts, she says. They will \u201cput our money where our heart is\u201d, she adds. Boris Johnson is deluded if he thinks he can negotiate a new trade deal with Europe by the end of 2020, she says. \u201cBoris Johnson only cares about Boris Johnson and he\u2019ll say whatever he needs to to stay in Number 10. This is a man who lied to the Queen,\u201d says Swinson. On to Jeremy Corbyn, she says the Labour leader won\u2019t be upfront about what he thinks on Brexit. \u201cI\u2019d like you to welcome my friend and our candidate to be the next prime minister,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cThe voice of a new liberal generation.\u201d Swinson says Corbyn and Johnson only know how to rehash ideas from the past \u2013 \u201cwhether it\u2019s the 1970s or the 1870s\u201d. She says the UK has wasted the last three-and-a-half years talking about Brexit. \u201cThere is no form of Brexit that would be good for our country,\u201d she says, whether it is done by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. We\u2019ve now got Matt Sanders, the party\u2019s candidate in Hampstead and Kilburn. \u201cPeople are responding to Jo\u2019s simple call \u2013 stop Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cFriends, Brexit must be stopped.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn likes remain votes but he doesn\u2019t want us to stay in the EU, says Sanders. He says that millions of people looked at Corbyn and Johnson last night and they didn\u2019t want to choose either. Daisy Cooper, the party\u2019s candidate in St Albans \u2013 not Camden \u2013 is opening the event. She says that while St Albans voted to stay in the EU, the constituency has a \u201chard Brexit\u201d MP in Conservative Anne Main. \u201cYou guys are going to have to work really, really hard over the next few weeks so give yourselves a round of applause and have a great night,\u201d she says. We\u2019re just waiting for the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch to begin in Camden. You can watch a live feed at the top of this blog. Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker is there. Hundreds of students and under-18s have been registered to vote without their knowledge after a council IT blunder, according to the Sun. Around 635 students were wrongly registered by Plymouth city council, and polling cards were mistakenly sent to up to 247 under-18s. The council, which was criticised over similar errors in May, said \u201ctagging issues\u201d on its internal systems had caused students and young people to automatically be added to its voting roster. Since 2014 it has been illegal to register anyone but yourself to vote. Johnny Mercer, the candidate for Plymouth Moor View, wrote on Twitter: The chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, Torsten Bell, has been looking at the Liberal Democrat election manifesto plans. More from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has commented on the Conservatives\u2019 national insurance plans. Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services, the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of \u00a31.64 a week, with those on universal credit getting about 60p. Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to \u00a311bn so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price. The Tories are stuck in the 1980s while a Labour government will tackle head-on the climate and human emergencies of our time. Here\u2019s our full story on the Tory national insurance announcement. Boris Johnson has said he wants to raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,000, letting slip a major Tory tax cut from the manifesto as he was speaking to workers in Teesside. The prime minister said he wanted to cut tax for working people as he was pressed by an employee at a fabrication yard about whether he would help \u201cpeople like us\u201d, not just the rich. The policy would ultimately be a tax cut of more than \u00a3400 for everyone earning more than the current threshold of \u00a38,632. However, it quickly emerged that the Tories would only pledge to raise the threshold to \u00a39,500 next year then lift it gradually over many years until it reached the target \u00a312,000 threshold. Two million people have applied to register to vote since the general election was called, the Press Association reports. A total of 2,048,039 applications were submitted between 29 October \u2013 the day the government called for an election on 12 December \u2013 and 19 November, according to government figures. More than a third of applications (35%) came from people under the age of 25. A further 30% were from 25 to 34-year-olds. That was quick. The Liberal Democrats have now suspended Waheed Rafiq. See my previous post. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has this story about the Liberal Democrat candidate in Birmingham Hodge Hill, Waheed Rafiq, who tweeted antisemitic comments, expressed apparent support for the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, backed Trump for president and stood as a Ukip candidate in the same seat in 2010. You can read the whole (pretty astonishing) story here. More on that \u2013 possibly accidental \u2013 announcement of a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has issued some initial reaction to the Liberal Democrat manifesto. He points out that, while they have followed Labour and the Tories in promising a big increase in spending, the Lib Dems are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income. The Liberal Democrats have followed Labour and the Conservatives in promising big increases in investment spending \u2013 a little bit more than the Conservative offer, still a lot less than the amount being proposed by Labour. Even so, their manifesto confirms that they are now the only major party committed to reduce the national debt as a fraction of national income, a goal now abandoned by both Labour and the Conservatives. He says the most eye-catching spending plan is a near quintupling in spending on universal free childcare, which would cement \u201can entirely new leg of the welfare state and offering a big boost to families with young children\u201d. \u201cWe should though be cautious about expecting this to result in a big improvement in either child outcomes or a big increase in the number of parents in paid work,\u201d said Johnson. Additional revenues would come from \u00a337bn worth of tax increases including increases in income tax and corporation tax rates, a reform to capital gains tax and a very big rise in air passenger duty. Nearly \u00a36bn is attributed to the dubious, if inevitable, \u2018anti-avoidance\u2019 measures. Johnson also says that the party\u2019s claim that there would be a \u00a350bn \u201cwindfall\u201d from stopping Brexit is \u201cwithin the range of plausible estimates for the extent of that additional revenue\u201d. The biggest individual source of income for additional spending though would be the \u00a314 billion \u2018remain bonus\u2019. This is an estimate of the additional tax revenue (net of payments to the EU) accruing in 2024-25 as a result of the economy being, on their estimates, about 2% bigger than otherwise in the event of remaining in the EU. (The \u00a350bn bonus they focus on comes from cumulating additional revenues over five years). Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty over such an estimate. That said if it were to become clear not only that we were going to remain but that that was a settled state for the long term, we could expect some additional growth and with it additional tax revenue. Their estimate is within the range of plausible estimates for the extent of that additional revenue. Labour\u2019s shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has responded to Tory party proposals for victims to get the right to attend parole hearings. After almost a decade of cuts to the criminal justice system, the Conservatives have all but decriminalised rape. This announcement cannot cover over the fact we know that secret CPS targets incentivised difficult cases being dropped. Labour will carry out a fundamental review of rape survivors\u2019 treatment and provide the law, policy and resources required to reverse the lowest prosecution rates on record. Women in particular have learned they cannot trust Boris Johnson, not least with their most fundamental rights. Chakrabarti is referring to this story from a week ago which reveals that tens of thousands of rape cases could have been dropped because of secret targets implemented by the CPS. My colleague Rowena Mason says the Tory aides accompanying Boris Johnson are now in a bit of a panic. I\u2019ve got a meeting this afternoon, so my colleague Frances Perraudin is now taking over. And this is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said about Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to raise the national insurance threshold in a briefing paper (pdf) when he floated the idea during the Tory leadership contest. Currently, only earnings above \u00a38,632 per year 3 are subject to NICs (employee, employer, and self-employed). Mr. Johnson has not stated how much he would like to raise this threshold by, nor whether he would raise just the employee and self-employed thresholds or the employer one too. If just the employee and self-employed thresholds are changed, raising the threshold by \u00a31,000 takes 600,000 workers out of NICs altogether and costs the government about \u00a33bn per year. If the employer one is changed as well, the cost goes up to \u00a34.5bn per year. Raising the threshold to \u00a312,500 ... would cost \u00a311bn per year if just the employee and self-employed thresholds are raised, or \u00a317bn if employer ones are as well, and would take 2.4 million workers out of NICs. Any of these policies would have a larger proportional impact on the after-tax earnings of low-earning workers than high-earning ones (though the very lowest earning workers \u2013 who currently do not pay NICs \u2013 would be unaffected). However, when we look at the impact of the policy on household incomes, the picture is rather different. Figure 4 shows the distributional impact of raising all NICs thresholds, including that for employer NICs, to \u00a312,500. 16 million households gain from the policy, but as the figure makes clear, the largest proportional gains go to those in the middle to upper part of the income distribution. This happens for two key reasons. First, those in households towards the bottom of the income distribution are much less likely to be in work, and of course only workers benefit from this policy. Second, households nearer the bottom get a larger share of their income from benefits, rather than earnings, which means that the policy has a smaller impact on their incomes. And here is a chart from the IFS report showing the distributional impact on households. Obviously, we don\u2019t yet have the full details of what the Conservatives are proposing, but just what we\u2019ve heard from Johnson. (See 2.11pm.) Some journalists think Boris Johnson may not have been planning to announce a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut in a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees. This is from the FT\u2019s George Parker. And this is from the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott. This is what Boris Johnson said in response to the question about whether his \u201clow tax\u201d policies would mean low taxes for people like Johnson himself, or for the workers and the engineering firm. (See 1.49pm.) He replied: I mean low tax for ... working people. If we look at what we\u2019re doing, and what I\u2019ve said in the last few days, we\u2019re going to be cutting national insurance up to \u00a312,000 [ie, lifting the threshold up to \u00a312,000], we\u2019re going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses. We are cutting tax for working people. This is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said about this proposal (one that Johnson floated when he was running for the Tory leadership) in its green budget published in the autumn. (Bold type in the original.) Raising the point at which employees and the self-employed start to pay national insurance contributions (NICs), from its planned level of \u00a38,788 per year in 2020\u201321, would cost about \u00a33bn for every \u00a31,000 by which it is raised. If the employer NICs threshold were raised alongside this, the total cost would be \u00a35bn. Raising NICs thresholds would benefit everyone who currently pays NICs \u2013 all workers above the bottom 12% of the weekly earnings distribution, or any employee aged 25+ working at least 20 hours per week at the national living wage. Raising the NICs threshold is the best way to help low and middle earners through the tax system, but if the aim is to help the lowest earners, increasing work allowances under universal credit is much more effective. Only 3% of the total gains from raising the NICs threshold (either by \u00a31,000 or to the personal allowance threshold) would accrue to the poorest fifth of households. Spending \u00a33bn on increasing work allowances could raise the incomes of the poorest fifth of households by 1.5%, compared with less than 0.1% under an equally costly NICs cut. Increasing aviation duties for frequent flyers, raising up to \u00a35bn a year, is among policies announced by the Liberal Democrats in an election manifesto based around investment in green technologies and higher spending on public services, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Johnson says he is committed to the nuclear deterrent. That investment will continue, he says. He says Jeremy Corbyn has been a unilateralist and in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Johnson seemed to get a respectful hearing from the workforce, but it was hard to detect much evidence of enthusiasm for him from what was said in the questions. Q: Why is the government withholding the dossier on Russian interference in elections when it has been cleared by the security services? Johnson says he has seen no evidence of Russian interference in British elections. He says he saw no reason to change the normal timetable for publication of these reports. Q: Don\u2019t the public have a right to know what it says? Johnson does not address this point directly, and just repeats what he said in his first answer. Q: Why do MPs think the 17.4m people who voted for Brexit did not know what they voted for? Johnson says most MPs voted remain. He says Brexit provides great opportunities. The UK can still be great friends with the EU. But it should be able to determine its future, he says. Q: Can you guarantee us that you will never sell off the NHS? Yes, says Johnson. He says what Jeremy Corbyn was saying about this last night was an invention. The NHS is a fantastic thing, he says. He says under no circumstances will it be for the sale. He says he will invest massively in it. And he can because he understands how to achieve a strong economy. He says Corbyn has produced this \u201cnonsense\u201d because they want to conceal the gap in their Brexit plan. They won\u2019t say what they want to do. He says he asked Corbyn nine times what side he would be on in the next Brexit referendum. Johnson says he did not get an answer. That is not \u201cdynamic leadership\u201d. Q: You say you believe in low taxes. Is that for people like you, or people like us? Johnson says he is talking about low taxes for the people here. He says Labour\u2019s policies would inevitably lead to higher taxes. \u201cThe problem with socialism is that you always run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d He says he wants a high-wage, high-skills, low-tax economy. Q: Will foreign workers be hired for the new ships being built by Babcock? Johnson says Brexit will allow the UK to take control of its immigration policy. That does not mean the country will become hostile to immigrants, he says. He says he would like to have a shipbuilding renaissance in this country. He says the Type 26 frigate is an amazing ship. He wants to be able to export them to the US. In response to a question about social care, Johnson says he understands the problem. More money has been put into social care. And he will put \u201ca lot more\u201d in, he says. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: It took a long time to get trade deals with other countries. How confident are you you can get trade deals quickly. Johnson says he has a deal ready to go. (He is talking about the withdrawal agreement, but he was asked about post-Brexit trade deals \u2013 a completely different matter.) He says, after Brexit, we will be able to change our rules on animal welfare. That deal is ready to go, he says. He can put his deal in the oven \u2013 gas mark four, gas mark eight \u2013 and by January it will be pretty crispy, he says. Johnson asks his audience how enthusiastic they are about another Brexit referendum. Let\u2019s get this done, he says. Boris Johnson is opening with a version of his standard stump speech. He claims that he had to have an election because parliament was blocking Brexit. He has an oven-ready Brexit deal all ready to go. Boris Johnson is now doing a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. My colleague Rowena Mason is there. One thing to note about Nicola Sturgeon on this election campaign so far: she looks like she is really enjoying herself. She is smiley, joking with activists and media and generally more relaxed than she\u2019s appeared for a while. At her speech this morning (see 1.30pm) told reporters that she was picking up \u201centhusiasm and optimism\u201d about a second referendum from voters. Despite telling activists that everyone is \u201cheartily sick\u201d of Brexit, that attitude clearly doesn\u2019t extend to constitutional matters. She was also clear that Boris Johnson was wrong about a current deal between Labour and the SNP on a second independence referendum, although asked about her red lines for future post-election negotiations she joked that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwere looking pretty pink\u201d. She added that she thought Corbyn has \u201ckind of accepted the principle\u201d of Scotland deciding its own future. In his Q&amp;A after her speech in Dundee Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, insisted that the SNP has not done a deal with Labour about supporting a minority government after the election. It is the line that party has always used, and there is no reason to believe that a private deal has been agreed. But what was striking was how, even without any pact, the SNP and Labour are starting to sound very similar in what they say about the Tories. Sturgeon said that a Tory government would strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the US that would lead to the cost of drugs rising. This is word for word what Labour says. And last night, in the ITV debate, Jeremy Corbyn used the argument that under the Tories the Brexit crisis would go on for years, because negotiating a UK-US trade deal would take most of a decade. Today Sturgeon said much the same thing. (See 12.14pm.) (Why are the SNP and Labour saying the same thing? Presumably because they both know that these attack lines are persuasive with voters.) Here are the main points from Sturgeon\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. Sturgeon claimed that Scottish independence would not be as disruptive as Brexit. She said she understood why people were claiming that Scottish independence would be as chaotic as Brexit. But that was not true, she claimed. In her Q&amp;A she said: Much as I oppose Brexit, and I really oppose Brexit in principle, as well as for all the practical reasons I\u2019ve been talking about, there was nothing inevitable about the mess of the Brexit process. That was down to the fact that those who advocated to leave in the referendum didn\u2019t put any detail of what it would mean in practice, the trade-offs, the compromises that would be required to implement that. Sturgeon said that, unlike the Brexiters, the SNP had a detailed plan for independence when it was proposing this ahead of the 2014 referendum. She went on: We had done the planning and we will do so again. And let us not allow the charlatans who were dishonest with people over Brexit to somehow suggest that constitutional change has to be that way. It was that way and is that way with Brexit because of their dishonest and their lack of planning. These are mistakes the independence campaign did not make in 2014 and will not make in future. She said there were multiple threats to Scotland from remaining in the UK. Make no mistake, it is now crystal clear that continued Westminster control means multiple threats to Scotland \u2013 to our economy and our living standards, and to our NHS and other public services. First of all there is the direct economic threat of Brexit. Leaving the European Union will mean lower economic growth and therefore lower tax revenue to fund public services. The second threat is to the workforce. The end of freedom of movement will make it harder to attract NHS and social care staff. And it will mean fewer people working in Scotland and therefore contributing tax revenue to public services. The third threat comes from the Tory power grab on the Scottish parliament in their pursuit of their Brexit vision. They\u2019ve already used Brexit to grab powers from the Scottish parliament. With the rightwing of the Tory party in full cry, can anyone have any confidence there won\u2019t be a further power-grab attempt on Scotland\u2019s parliament as, UK-wide, they compromise on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards? She said a Tory government would strike a trade deal with the US that could lead to drug prices rising for the NHS. She said: The Tories are desperate to do a trade deal with Donald Trump. That could mean large rises in the cost of NHS drugs. And President Trump has said everything, including the NHS, is on the table. She insisted that, even if Brexit were stopped, that would not undermine the case for Scottish independence. (See 12.30pm.) She backed claims that in practice Labour would have to agree to holding a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020, regardless of what Corbyn says now. (See 12.34pm.) She said that the SNP was the only party that could take seats from the Conservatives in Scotland. (See 12.19pm.) Boris Johnson has said that flood-hit families and businesses will eligible for government grants worth up to \u00a35,000 for new resilience measures. He made the pledge in a Yorkshire Post article. Here\u2019s an excerpt. We must do everything possible to protect against future flooding and speed up the recovery time. So I can announce today that flood-hit homes and businesses will be eligible for government grants of up to \u00a35,000 for new resilience measures. This money will help people with the cost of installing precautions like flood doors or raised electrical systems. Steps of this kind will reduce any damage that could be caused by future floods and accelerate any clean-ups, enabling people to return to their homes more quickly. Sturgeon says it was no inevitable that Brexit had to be this chaotic. She says, if Scotland were to vote for independence, the process of separating from England would not have to be like Brexit. Q: Boris Johnson said last night Labour had already done a deal with the SNP on independence. Jeremy Corbyn said that was not true. But this morning Humza Yousef said in practice Labour would allow an early second referendum. (See 10.54am.) Sturgeon says she is surprised anyone believes anything Johnson says. She says there has been no deal with Labour. But she says she agrees with what Yousef said this morning. Jeremy Corbyn favours self-determination \u201cfor virtually every other country on the planet\u201d, she says. She says she would expect Scotland\u2019s desire for a second referendum to be granted. Nicola Sturgeon is now taking questions. Q: If you manage to stop Brexit, won\u2019t that take away your justification for a second independence referendum? No, says Sturgeon. She says Brexit illustrates why Scotland should be in charge of its own future. But it is only one example. If Brexit is stopped, there is no guarantee it won\u2019t return as a prospect. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is not just going to give up, she says. A Tory candidate who claimed British Jews who visited Israel returned \u201cbrainwashed\u201d has been suspended from the party, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: Amjad Bashir, who is standing for election in the Leeds North East constituency, apologised this week for the comments and said he intends to meet local Jewish groups and travel to Israel \u201cto gain direct experience from the situation on the ground there\u201d. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cMr Bashir has been suspended from the party pending investigation and election support has been withdrawn.\u201d A pro-Brexit restaurateur, Bashir was elected as a Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber in 2014 before he defected to the Conservatives in 2015. Sturgeon says continued Westminster control poses multiple threats to Scotland. She says she will give three examples. First, Brexit could harm the Scottish economy. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would cost the Scottish economy \u00a39bn by the end of the decade, she says. Second, Brexit would lead to the Scottish workforce shrinking, she says. There would be particular problems in the care sector. She says the Tories are \u201cdeliberately and shamefully\u201d giving the impression that EU workers are a burden, not a resource. That is shameful, she says. Third, the Tories would reduce Scotland\u2019s powers, she says She says they have already used Brexit to take powers from the Scottish parliament, legislating for the first time in this area without the approval of the Scottish parliament. She says the Tories are desperate to do a trade deal with the US. That could lead to large prices in NHS drugs. And the Tories would over-ride Scottish wishes if Scotland tried to get in the way of that trade deal. Sturgeon says Labour cannot win in Scotland. In all the 13 Scottish seats the Tories hold, the SNP are the challengers, she says. Strugeon turns to the Lib Dems. She says there now seem to be more Tories in the Lib Dems than there are Lib Dems. She says one of the Tory defectors to the Lib Dems (she is referring to Sam Gyimah) described free university tuition as a fantasy. But it is not a fantasy in Scotland, she says. Nicola Sturgeon is giving her speech in Dundee. The Scottish first minister says today feels like the morning after the night before. Yesterday Scotland was talked about in the leaders\u2019 debate,but not represented. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn showed they are not fit to be prime minister, she says. She says this election really matters because \u201cthe future of Scotland is on the line\u201d. She says she thinks everyone in Scotland is \u201cheartily sick\u201d of Brexit. But this would just be the warm-up act, she says. The trade talks would have to start. And, with Nigel Farage pulling Boris Johnson\u2019s strings, there is a chance of a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period. Sturgeon also said post-Brexit trade talks could take \u201cyears and years and years\u201d. The truth is Westminster is going to be engulfed in Brexit chaos for years to come, with long-term damage to Scotland guaranteed. The full tables from the YouGov poll last night on the ITV leaders\u2019 debate are now available on its website here (pdf). Laurence Janta-Lipinksi, a polling specialist, thinks the raw data reflect well on Jeremy Corbyn. I\u2019ve corrected the post at 9.54am because it contained a significant typo. Dawn Butler criticised Boris Johnson for saying in the debate last night that the monarchy was beyond reproach, not for saying that the monarch was beyond reproach. Johnson was commenting on the royal family generally, not the Queen as an individual. Sorry for the error. You can read all the Guardian\u2019s coverage of last night\u2019s election debate on our election page here. And here is a roundup of what journalists and commentators were saying about it on Twitter last night. From Patrick Maguire\u2019s Morning Call email briefing for the New Statesman Call it a score draw? Well, it depends. Given Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s less than stellar personal ratings, that the viewing public and this morning\u2019s serious papers concluded there was little in it will have heartened the Labour leadership. And given that Boris Johnson sold himself to Conservative MPs and members as the only candidate able to defeat Corbyn for good, his failure to do so on a debate stage he had no real incentive to be on will have set alarm bells ringing in some Tory quarters - albeit quietly. Strikingly, nearly half of 2017 Conservative voters surveyed by YouGov last night thought the Labour leader performed well. But look beyond what the numbers say about who won or lost last night and the real question is whether either succeeded in changing the electoral game altogether ... For all the audible contempt for Johnson among the studio audience \u2013 several of his answers, just like Corbyn\u2019s, were met with derisive laughter \u2013 the Conservatives will still be broadly happy with their lot. They know they are more or less the only game in town for leave voters and most Scots unionists and Corbyn was unwilling to respond in kind. From Michael Deacon in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) In all honesty, the most memorable answers were for the most inane question. Right at the end, a young man in the audience asked Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn what present they would give each other for Christmas. Mr Corbyn said he would give the prime minister a copy of A Christmas Carol by Dickens: \u201cSo you can see how nasty Scrooge was.\u201d Mr Johnson said that he would give Mr Corbyn \u201ca good read\u201d too: \u201ca copy of my brilliant Brexit deal\u201d. If that seems vapid and inane, it was at least in keeping with the rest of the broadcast \u2013 because, although it was meant to be the first big debate of this election campaign, it didn\u2019t really feel like a debate at all. It simply never got going. In fact, it wasn\u2019t allowed to. Throughout, the moderator, Julie Etchingham, kept butting in to cut the two leaders short (\u201cThank you, Mr Johnson! Thank you, Mr Corbyn!\u201d), and so they rarely if ever got beyond the soundbites they\u2019d come armed with. In the end, it felt like little more than a rushed, bullet-point digest of both sides\u2019 slogans. From Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome In football terms, Johnson played a high press and Corbyn relied on counter-attack. Neither scored. Which takes us back to our start. The Labour leader didn\u2019t win the debate. So he had no victory with which to cut through to voters. And so the prime minister doesn\u2019t have any ground to make up in the further TV debates \u2013 or elsewhere. That suits him fine. From Quentin Letts in the Times (paywall) One of the most striking things was the audience laughter. You normally expect the two teams\u2019 supporters to clap like maniacs but last night they deployed forced, supportive, mocking, occasionally genuinely disbelieving laughter as a weapon of attrition. \u201cDoes the truth matter? Of course,\u201d Mr Johnson said. A roar of ironic mirth from the Corbyn supporters in the crowd. The same thing happened in reverse when Mr Corbyn, after struggling to explain his Brexit position, said: \u201cI\u2019ve made the position clear.\u201d A great belch of merriment from the audience. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Plaid Cymru is today calling for the creation of a new tax credit for people who pay more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities. This is from Ben Lake, who is seeking re-election as MP for Ceredigion. Everyone in Wales should have safe, stable and suitable housing but that\u2019s fast becoming the privilege of fewer people every year. Renters in Wales have a bad deal: 37% of private renters in Wales earn less than \u00a315,000, and almost half of private households in Wales spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This leaves over 100,000 households with very little to spend on basic living expenses like food, heating or transport. Plaid Cymru will help those people by creating a new tax credit of up to \u00a325 a week to households paying over 30% of their income on private rent and utilities, providing people with much needed relief and flexibility to spend on other vital needs like food, heating and transport. Labour says Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that it would allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020, in addition to the second Brexit referendum that it is planning for next year, is not true. But on the Today programme this morning the SNP MSP Humza Yousaf said he thought in practice a Labour government would agree to hold one. He said: We\u2019ve been very clear it\u2019s not for Jeremy Corbyn, neither Boris Johnson, it is for the Scottish people and the Scottish parliament to decide when there should be another independence referendum, and we want to hold one in 2020, as the first minister has said. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on this has shifted a number of times already in what is a relatively short campaign. I suspect what he says now will not necessarily be what he says when he needs the keys to No 10. In their manifesto, which will be launched this afternoon, the Liberal Democrats will call for the introduction of safe standing areas in all-seater football stadia. Layla Moran, the party\u2019s culture spokeswoman, said: Football matches in this country should not be subject to the bureaucracy of executives and ministers who are stuck in the past, and don\u2019t understand the game. People want to see safe standing in their stadiums, they want the knock-on effect of a reduction in ticket prices, and they want to be free to enjoy the sport they love without restrictive red tape. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said it is \u201csickening\u201d to hear Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, say last night that she would be willing to use a nuclear weapon. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, who is on the Tory battlebus Some readers have been asking below the line why the page on the YouGov website with the results of its poll on the leaders\u2019 debate has a 6.50pm timestamp, which was more than an hour before the debate even started. A YouGov spokesman has called with (as I expected) an innocent explanation. He said that, knowing it would have to turn around the poll results quickly, YouGov launched the web page in advance of the debate. The article originally said something about how the poll results would be published on that page after the debate ended. Later the article was updated with the poll findings. But the timestamp still reflected the original publication time. Almost 7 million people watched the ITV leaders\u2019 debate last night, according to ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. A subsequent ITV programme, featuring interviews with four leaders of the smaller parties, was watched by more than 2 million people. The Electoral Commission has released a statement saying that it cannot intervene in the Conservative party bogus Twitter handle row because it does not have a role in regulating what parties say during election campaigns. A spokesman for the commission said: Voters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election, so they have the information they need to decide for themselves how to vote. The Electoral Commission seeks to deliver transparency to the public through the political finance rules. While we do not have a role in regulating election campaign content, we repeat our call to all campaigners to undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency. In her Today interview Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, also criticised Boris Johnson for saying the monarchy was \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d in last night\u2019s ITV debate. She said: I think most people would think that there is always room for improvement, and I think that Boris\u2019s response in regards to the royal family being beyond reproach was just flabbergasting with everything that is currently being exposed in regards to Prince Andrew and the scandal and the paedophile. To actually not talk about the victims, which Jeremy did right straight away and saying that we should be focusing on the victims, but then to say that the royal family is beyond reproach is unforgivable. It just stinks of this kind of, the law doesn\u2019t apply to a certain group of people in society. And I just think it\u2019s horrendous. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has given a series of interviews this morning, and the election questions mostly focused on the row about the Conservatives\u2019 abuse of their Twitter account. Here are the main points he has been making. Raab refused to apologise for the Conservative party\u2019s decision to rename one of their Twitter accounts \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d during the debate. He rejected claims that people had been misled by the bogus Twitter handle. (See 7.46am.) He refused to say whether or not the party would do the same thing again. But he implied it was unlikely. He told the Today programme: We will always abide by the rules with these things and, if there is advice that comes out, look at it very carefully. He said it was right for the Tories to respond to the \u201clies\u201d told about them. He said: We make no apologies for having an instant rebuttal for all the nonsense and lies put out. And Jeremy Corbyn repeated it last night, saying we want to sell off the NHS. He claimed that Boris Johnson was the clear winner of the debate, because the snap YouGov poll afterwards showed him well ahead of Jeremy Corbyn on who came out the most prime ministerial. Raab said: Overall, on the exam question in this election campaign, \u2018who do you want as your prime minister, or who do you think is more suited to be prime minster?\u2019 [Johnson] won by two to one. And that\u2019s what matters. But on other metrics Corbyn won. The detailed figures are here. Raab criticised Corbyn for failing nine times in the debate last night to say whether or not he would back remain or leave in the second Brexit referendum that Labour plans to hold. This is from Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov, the polling organisation. Both sets of findings from the YouGov snap poll after the debate were covered on our live blog last night. More people thought Boris Johnson won than Jeremy Corbyn won, but more people thought Corbyn performed well than Johnson performed well. That sounds like a contradiction, but it isn\u2019t necessarily. In sport, the winning team isn\u2019t always the one that plays best. Here is Caroline Lucas, who is campaigning for re-election as a Green party MP, on the Tories\u2019 abuse of Twitter last night. Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Twitter had not done enough to punish the Conservative party for using one of its accounts to mislead people during last night\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate. The party rebranded its own press account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d, implying that it was providing an impartial, factchecking service. Twitter has effectively just issued the Tories with a warning, saying \u201ccorrective action\u201d will be taken if they do this again. Asked whether this was enough, Butler told Today: No, it\u2019s not enough. We\u2019ve been talking about the responsibilities of the social media platforms for quite a while. And they have to do better. And I think this is another example where social media has failed, and it\u2019s terrible. Asked what else Twitter should have done, she said it would have been better if the account had been taken down during the debate last night. She said: I think they had options. They could have either renamed the account, and put back the original branding, because in order to try and deceive the public the Conservative party changed everything ... They could have just suspended the account and taken it down. To me, that would have been the better punishment. And the other thing is, remove the blue tick [Twitter\u2019s account verification mechanism], because you cannot have a blue tick if you are trying to impersonate a legitimate account. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. There are only two biggish events in the diary for the day. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech in Dundee on the \u2018Tory threat\u2019 to Scotland\u2019s services. 5pm: The Liberal Democrats launch their manifesto. There are also various, more low-level campaign events taking place, including Boris Johnson campaigning on the Tory battlebus. The Liberal Democrats promise an emergency \u00a34.6bn cash injection into schools, Layla Moran, the party\u2019s education spokeswoman, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. The initial sum would increase to more than \u00a310bn by 2024-25, if the Lib Dems formed the next government, Moran said. It would be funded from the \u00a315bn that the party says it can conjure up as a \u201cremain bonus\u201d from halting Brexit. Moran\u2019s education pledges went beyond the purely financial. She continued: Also, we would value our teachers more. We would end the punitive, high-stakes testing regime that we have in schools. We would replace Ofsted with an inspectorate that has wellbeing at the core of what it does. Her comments will be welcomed by many in the profession. Ofsted, Moran said, has been responsible for \u201cnarrowing the curriculum [and] a focus on data\u201d. After their involvement in the coalition government and the tripling of fees for university students, the Liberal Democrats do not have a good reputation when it comes to education pledges. The party had promised during the 2010 election not to increase fees. Moran was not challenged on the record. She pledged that the party would \u201creview student finance and bring back maintenance grants\u201d. In case you missed it, the Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, reported on the factcheck controversy last night, including criticism from the established factchecking organisation Full Fact. As Waterson reported, Full Fact, which is run by a charity, said it had complained to Twitter and said the account should not be allowed to be used in this way while verified. \u201cIt is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their Twitter account \u2018factcheckUK\u2019 during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent factchecking service.\u201d Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has defended the Tory factcheck stunt on Twitter last night, even in the face of Twitter\u2019s stern criticism. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Raab said it was \u201cvery clear\u201d that the account was affiliated with Conservative campaign headquarters. \u201cWe have had all sorts of nonsense thrown at the Conservatives. We are going to be in the process of having a really good instant rebuttal,\u201d he said. Raab brushed aside criticism from established factcheckers. \u201cWho said Full Fact is the final arbiter of what the public need to see?\u201d he said. Asked about Twitter\u2019s statement accusing the Tories of misleading the public, Raab added: I don\u2019t agree. As I said to you before it was pegged to the Conservative campaign HQ account. Anyone who looked at it for more than a split second would not have been fooled. Twitter has released a statement saying the Conservative party has misled the public by styling its press office account as a factchecking operation during the televised leaders debate, the BBC has reported. In an almost unprecedented political intervention by the social network, Twitter said it would take \u201cdecisive corrective action\u201d if a similar stunt was attempted again. During Tuesday night\u2019s leadership debate on ITV, the @CCHQPress account was renamed \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d. Although the handle remained the same, as my colleague Jim Waterson reported, all other branding was changed to resemble an independent factchecking outlet. It may not have been immediately apparent to an individual who saw the account\u2019s tweets in their feed that it was a product of Conservative party HQ. Twitter\u2019s statement, carried by the BBC, said: Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information \u2013 in a manner seen during the UK election debate \u2013 will result in decisive corrective action. No one really landed any telling blows, with the whole show descending into second-rate light entertainment. Even Prince Andrew could probably have made a better fist of answering the questions. Despite talking over Corbyn and Etchingham at every opportunity \u2013 his ego can\u2019t allow the possibility of conversation \u2013 Johnson reverted to bluster and lies while trying to steer everything back to his Brexit deal that he had rejected 18 months previously. Corbyn couldn\u2019t even take advantage of the most open of goals. One questioner asked about personal trust. Here was the Labour leader\u2019s chance to ask Boris how many children he had, his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri and his broken promises to family and country. It would have been a slam-dunk moment that could have maybe changed the momentum of the election. But Corbyn blew it. The first half ended with an insincere handshake. The rest was something of a non-event. Corbyn scored well on the NHS with a redacted document but the audience was so dispirited that the debate ended in a Blind Date chat. Corbyn would give Boris A Christmas Carol for Christmas: Johnson would give Corbyn some damson jam. No voters\u2019 minds would be changed. The only winner was Etchingham who somehow held the shitshow together. Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined. Top billing on most of the front pages is given to the election leaders\u2019 debate with some focusing on the snap YouGov poll that declared Boris Johnson won the night 51%-49%. Others highlighted the leaders\u2019 answers, or lack of them. As for what the parties will be wanting to talk about today: Labour will promise to eliminate what it calls the \u201c10 modern scourges of poverty\u201d, from soaring food bank use to childhood deprivation, in its latest attack on the Conservatives\u2019 record in government. Among its policies are increasing the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour and extending it to under-25s; reforming universal credit; and scrapping restrictive rules including the two-child limit and the benefits cap. The Lib Dems will launch their manifesto in London and announce a plan to extend the scope of free school meals; increase schools spending by more than \u00a310bn a year within the next parliament; and recruit 20,000 more teachers. The Tories have announced a package of policies for victims of crime, which includes allowing victims and the media to apply to attend parole hearings and a 25% increase in the victims surcharge \u2013 a fine on offenders that goes towards refuges and community support for victims of domestic and sexual abuse. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s politics news. It is the day after the night before and if you missed the debate we have a lot of material to catch you up. Start here with our wrap of what happened. Rowena Mason offers her analysis including the leaders\u2019 best lines, worst moments and overall pitch. Our panel has given its verdict on how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn fared. We\u2019ve fact-checked the leaders\u2019 claims, and there is news about the Conservative press office changing its Twitter name to make it look like a factchecking service for the duration of the debate. Leaders of minor parties have shared their views on what went down on ITV, as have readers, who have delivered their mostly unflattering verdicts. Dan Sabbagh writes that Corbyn outperformed expectations, Andrew Sparrow gives his take, and John Crace has written a devastating sketch, which closes with the observation that \u201cgiven the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one\u201d. As usual, you can reach me on Twitter here. I\u2019ll be looking after the blog for the first hour or so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
