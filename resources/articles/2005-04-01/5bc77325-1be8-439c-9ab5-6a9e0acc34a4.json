I had a Halloween egg fight with his younger brother - whose nose, I remember, was once very badly bitten by a mutual friend's dog ... My first memory of Amy is of her bossing her little entourage in the school dinner hall. I was strangely attracted to her - much to the disgust of my narrow-minded peers. We didn't meet properly till I moved back home from uni and started working at the local off-licence. She stood behind the counter holding court with the customers. Danny was working as a plasterer and gardener, and would come into the shop covered in plaster, leaves and mud. Not much has changed. I persuaded a bloke I used to play football with to give me her number. 'Hi,' I said, 'I'm the guy who bought beers off you last week.' 'Quite a few people bought beers off me last week,' she replied. It was cruel. I knew who it was. We spend our time sleeping, talking, walking, pottering, cooking, drinking, and doing other, less virtuous activities. On a walk up Snowdon, Danny went for a wee without taking a wind-reading first. We drank a bottle of champagne on the summit, and Danny played his harmonica the whole way down. A stranger invited us inside his cottage, where we sat beside the fire for tea and Bara Brith [Welsh fruitcake]. On a weekend in Scotland we went skinny-dipping in a loch. A scotch mist drizzled down, and in the forest we found a deer-stalker tree-house. We climbed the rickety ladder and watched the sky from the treetops. \u00b7 If you would like to appear on this page, contact us at you.are.great@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
