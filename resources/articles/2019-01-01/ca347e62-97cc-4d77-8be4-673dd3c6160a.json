Tweeting from the White House on a Saturday otherwise consumed by the government shutdown, Trump shared a version of Washington Times and Fox News headlines about Jill Abramson\u2019s forthcoming book, Merchants of Truth, which suggested Abramson believes the Times is biased against the president. \u201cMs Abramson is 100% correct,\u201d he wrote, before seeking to justify his controversial attacks on the newspaper and other media outlets. \u201cHorrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term[s] Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party!\u201d Abramson was the first woman to be executive editor of the Times, filling the role from 2011 to 2014. She is now a columnist for the Guardian. In an email to the Guardian on Saturday, she wrote: \u201cDonald Trump is echoing a piece on Fox News (surprise) that distorts and takes what I wrote totally out of context. \u201cBoth the NYT and [Washington Post] have had superb coverage of the corruption enveloping the Trump administration, the best investigative reporting I\u2019ve seen. My book is full of praise for both papers.\u201d Merchants of Truth, which will be released on 5 February, recounts how four news organizations \u2013 the Times, the Post, BuzzFeed and Vice \u2013 negotiated the rocky transition to the age of online news. In a tweet addressed to Trump on Saturday, Abramson wrote: \u201cAnyone who reads my book \u2026 will find I revere [the Times] and praise its tough coverage of you.\u201d The book includes Abramson\u2019s story of her time as Times editor, including her firing amid dramatic public fallout. Abramson left following conflict with Dean Baquet, a deputy who replaced her as executive editor. In her book, discussion of Baquet\u2019s choices in steering the paper includes the words: \u201cHis news pages were unmistakably anti-Trump.\u201d In an emailed statement, a Times spokeswoman said: \u201cEvery political administration complains about the scrutiny and coverage it receives from the free press. But our job is to seek the truth and hold power to account, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. \u201cThat is what we have done during the Trump administration, just as we did in the Obama, Bush and Clinton administrations. We take pride in our long history of journalistic independence and commitment to covering the news without fear or favor.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
