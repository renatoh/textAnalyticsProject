George Saville\u2019s first-half drive, his first goal for the club, set them on their way and Brit Assombalonga added a second in the 90th minute. Victory puts Tony Pulis\u2019s team a point behind the leaders Leeds. Bolton manager Phil Parkinson felt his players produced a performance Stephen Darby would be proud of. Parkinson and his players have endured an extremely difficult week after 29-year-old Darby was forced to retire because he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Stephen for a long time, and it was important that we put in a performance that reflected his character. Despite not getting the right result, I thought we did that.\u201d Pulis said: \u201cI thought we played really well in the first half, but we\u2019ve got to make sure that we take our chances and the opportunities we get.\u201d Millwall\u2019s poor run continued in a defeat at improving QPR. Two goals inside three first-half minutes proved decisive for Steve McClaren\u2019s side, with Massimo Luongo heading in from close range in the 30th minute and Eberechi Eze doubling the advantage with a left-foot drive. After beginning their campaign with four successive defeats, Rangers are now unbeaten in four. McClaren hailed Eze after the young forward played a starring role. \u201cHe\u2019s a talent but he can get better. We need to add discipline to his game and work-rate. He is showing more of that and he\u2019s getting the rewards, McClaren said. Millwall manager Neil Harris admitted he got his tactics and team selection wrong. \u201cI take full responsibility for picking the team I did and the tactics in the first half. I\u2019ll hold my hands up and say I got it wrong - I\u2019ve no problem with that.\u201d Lewis Grabban\u2019s header and a fine finish by Jo\u00e3o Carvalho were enough to give Nottingham Forest only their second league win of the season, against Sheffield Wednesday. Grabban headed in Ben Osborn\u2019s cross on 41 minutes and Carvalho doubled the lead after the break with an angled shot into the top right-hand corner. Steven Fletcher pulled one back for Wednesday with two minutes remaining but Aitor Karanka\u2019s team held on. Karanka said: \u201cI could have been happier, because we could have won this game even easier. We had a lot of chances and I only remember one chance for them, in the first half. \u201cWe played really well. I knew we needed to take a step forward after Saturday and we did that.\u201d Reading\u2019s struggles continued with a 2-1 defeat by Norwich at the Madejski Stadium. Teemu Pukki\u2019s long-range shot in the 14th minute put Norwich ahead and though J\u00f3n Dadi B\u00f6dvarsson equalised with 18 minutes remaining the visitors regained the lead within a minute as Mario Vrancic rifled into Sam Walker\u2019s bottom left-hand corner to keep Paul Clement\u2019s side in the bottom three. Birmingham remain winless after a goalless draw at Sheffield United, Omar Bogle wasting a glorious late chance for the Blues. Garry Monk insists it is only a matter of time until Birmingham\u2019s luck changes. \u201cEveryone wants to say it\u2019s a winless run which we understand - anyone that\u2019s seen us this season we\u2019ve deserved a lot more than what we\u2019ve got.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
