The Bulldogs boss is seemingly unable to determine which two of Trent Hodkinson, Moses Mbye and Josh Reynolds are his best option in 2015. Hasler has made his long-term call \u2013 and it is the right one \u2013 backing promising youngster Mbye and former Origin pivot Reynolds to carry the Bulldogs forward. The issue of this season is much murkier though with NSW halfback Hodkinson still on the books. And he has been named in the No7 jersey this week to tackle Parramatta after being \u201crested\u201d against the Broncos, the second time he has been \u201crested\u201d in Canterbury\u2019s last three games. Hodkinson played his best game of the season in the Bulldogs\u2019 return to Belmore against the Storm but is likely on his last chance against Parramatta this Friday. If he has a belter then Hasler will have little choice but to ride the Hodkinson train for the rest of the year. If he is again poor \u2013 as he has been for much of the year \u2013 then Hasler either has to publicly back him or axe him for good. Whatever way Hodkinson plays on Friday night, he will do so under the glare of a heavy spotlight. Smith celebrates 300 Cameron Smith celebrates game No300 on Friday night and he does so having achieved all there is to in the game. The Queensland and Australian skipper has led the Maroons to record series win after record series win while he has captained the Kangaroos to World Cup glory. He has led the Storm to three grand final wins and five deciders in all, and been named both the Golden Boot and Dally M Medal winner throughout his career. Perhaps most remarkable though has been Smith\u2019s penchant for winning. The champion hooker has won 205 of his 299 club games for the Storm \u2013 making him the fourth greatest winner in premiership history. If he is to guide the Storm to another win in his 300th game, there will be no player more deserving. Saints, Souths to stymie slide St George Illawarra and South Sydney will look to put an end to an alarming drop in form that has both teams on the verge of dropping out of the top eight at the SCG on Saturday night. The Dragons have dropped their last five after winning eight of nine and are down to seventh on the ladder, in the finals by nothing more than differential. The Rabbitohs have lost two of their last three \u2013 both to teams outside the eight \u2013 and have struggled to build any momentum in their title defence. But St George Illawarra look to be in the most danger. They get a host of stars back to tackle the Rabbitohs with Josh Dugan, Benji Marshall, Joel Thompson and Tyson Frizell all named to return \u2013 and they will all need to fire. Souths have a class edge but they are vulnerable this week with an attack struggling to find points and a pack that is creating no fear. There is an opening for the Saints. Whether they are good enough to take it is a different matter. Time to stand up for Tiger toddlers With another Tigers season all but finished, the time is now for the supposed next crop of Tiger superstars \u2013 Luke Brooks and Mitchell Moses \u2013 to stand up and show what all the fuss is about. While fullback James Tedesco has emerged from an injury-rattled start to his career to become one of the game\u2019s most exciting young talents, Brooks and Moses have not come on. The duo have been embarrassing defensively while neither has shown any kind of leadership expected in a top grade half. Both have been in the top grade for near-on two full seasons yet neither has even shown an inkling that they belong in the NRL. There is nothing left to lose against the Broncos. The Tigers are huge outsiders, the season is all but over. But the Tigers faithful need to see some sign, some indication, that these two are actually developing into the talents they are supposed to be. Sea Eagles surge the real deal? After enduring a season that has oscillated between tumultuous and downright disastrous, Manly remain remarkably in finals contention with eight rounds to play. They sit just two wins outside the eight despite being in last place for the majority of the season. They enter this off a decimation of the Titans but their supposed resurgence faces its first real test on Monday against the Cowboys. It is the beginning of a run that sees them tackle New Zealand, Brisbane and South Sydney \u2013 four teams ranked in the top five. If Manly are to claw their way back into finals contention, they will need to put in a competitive show at home against North Queensland on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
