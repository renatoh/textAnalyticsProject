And it would have seemed a safe bet then that, by the end of the century, all the taboos that could go would have gone. So the big surprise of the noughties in culture was the extent of the debate over how naughty you could be. In some areas, the decade ended with attitudes more censorious than they had been since the 50s. In this sense, the epoch began as it meant to go on. In the first triple-zero date for a thousand years, the Royal Academy staged Apocalypse, in which pieces by the Chapman Brothers and others restarted the argument over what could and should be art. And Eminem, with The Marshall Mathers LP, took hip-hop into mainstream music, where radio stations and record stores (still popular shops back then) grappled with the question of whether rappers' lyrics, with their frequently violent and misogynist references, could be played and sold without restrictions. Within 12 months, Chris Morris had proved that television could still provoke outraged front pages with a Brass Eye special that drew from tabloid newspapers and MPs precisely the anti-paedophile hysteria it satirised. Cinema offered a good example of the decade's tendency for liberation to be followed rapidly by moral panic. Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's Intimacy (2001) was the first mainstream British release to feature what seemed to be scenes of unsimulated sexual contact, a precedent followed and extended by Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs (2004). Scenes previously available only in dingy urban basements subject to police raids were now showing in multiplexes. But though these movies went very far beyond the glimpse of stocking of which Porter had written, it soon proved to be untrue that anything went. A visual explicitness claimed for scenes of consensual sex was next applied to extreme and violent acts, in movies including Irreversible (2002) and Antichrist (2009). This resulted in an ideological shift common in these times. Where past calls for cinematic censorship came most often from the political right, they were now generally led by the left, concerned by images of women and children. These progressive concerns about the limits of artistic freedom also affected galleries: in 2007, a Nan Goldin photograph (owned by Sir Elton John) was removed from the Baltic Gallery in Gateshead on police advice, a sanction also used this autumn against a childhood shot of Brooke Shields in Tate Modern. Such pre-emptive censorship demonstrated how, against most cultural predictions, taboos had not disappeared but simply mutated: paedophile fears replaced the puritanism of the past. But theatre \u2013 which had been, until the abolition in 1968 of the Lord Chamberlain's role as censor, the most-nannied art form \u2013 had now become the least. The global hit The Vagina Monologues (though created by Eve Ensler in 1996) had its real coming as the new millennium began, with theatres full of women chanting \"cunt\", a word that, in living memory, would have put producers in jail. And, as the noughties ended, broadcasting found itself in thrall to a new c-word: compliance. The morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse had died in 2001, believing that she'd had some success in reducing violence on the screen but convinced she had lost her battles over sexual content and explicit language. By 2009, though, her ghost would be beaming behind those Dame Edna glasses. A panic over content \u2013 caused by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's dirty phone calls to the actor Andrew Sachs \u2013 brought the implementation of editorial constraints of which Whitehouse never dreamed. Material freely broadcast between the 7os and 00s was banned from inclusion in 21st-century series. In this, as in many aspects of culture, the noughties, unexpectedly, became the nicies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
