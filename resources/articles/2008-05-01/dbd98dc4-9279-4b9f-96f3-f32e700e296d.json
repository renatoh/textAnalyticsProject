Yet paradoxically, the latest Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests in the same subjects show a systematic decline. One explanation is that the national curriculum-based tests are a better reflection of pupils' achievements than the broader competences of the international tests. An alternative view is that the English \"high-stakes\" testing regime (a term borrowed from the US to describe tests that have significant repercussions for pupils, teachers or schools) has conditioned teachers to teach to the test, endlessly rehearse pupils and, of necessity, relegate their most imaginative teaching to whatever time is left over. If this interpretation is correct, it suggests that many of the reforms introduced by recent governments might be counterproductive. Coincidentally, critics of the US high-stakes testing reform agenda, such Arizona professors Audrey Amrein and David Berliner (the latter a former president of the American Educational Research Association), also claim the US evidence points to failure. \"If the intended goal of high-stakes testing policy is to increase student learning, then that policy is not working. While a state's high-stakes test may show increased scores, there is little support in these data that such increases are anything but the result of test preparation and/or the exclusion of students from the testing process.\" Once again Goodhart's law, formulated by a onetime chief adviser to the Bank of England, seems to have been confirmed: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. And, as Warwick Mansell has documented in his book Education by Numbers, all those involved collude in meeting specified targets. It seems increasingly likely, however, that these targets will bear as much likeness to reality as did the production goals of the former USSR. In spite of this, the government appears to be in denial. It is pressing on with its test-led agenda regardless of mounting evidence from advisory committees, academic experts, thinktanks, the teacher unions and even, at times, Ofsted. Is it afraid that the whole edifice of reforms will crash down and reveal 20 years of wasted efforts? Yet in persisting with ill-thought out reforms, the government risks damaging, possibly irrevocably, the education system. Why is civil society allowing this to happen? Perhaps because the direction of travel has been amazingly constant since Baker's virtual centralisation of the education service in 1988. With both major political parties subscribing to the same impoverished thinking there appears to be no alternative. Furthermore, resistance has been weakened by the age-old ploy of dividing opposition. Local authorities have been emasculated. Teaching unions are split between rival factions. Parents, too, have been divided by the creation of schools with varied resources, governance and autonomy, and seduced by the myth of choice. The leaders of commerce and industry have welcomed the imposition of their market model into public services. Those who have protested, such as the alliance of 13 independent organisations formed to debate the 2005 Education Act, have been snubbed or are mocked as dinosaurs. The lack of a well-informed public debate before the forced imposition of unproven, yet far-reaching, changes to education is reminiscent of other highly questionable political acts such as the privatisation of railways, the compulsory use of private finance initiatives for public projects, and the disastrous war in Iraq. Such unintelligent behaviour might be forgivable when undertaken by an impulsive individual or a rash company but beggars belief when it is enacted by a modern democratic government. Surely citizens and their children deserve better? \u00b7 Peter Mortimore is spending six months as a professor of education at the University of Southern Denmark"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
