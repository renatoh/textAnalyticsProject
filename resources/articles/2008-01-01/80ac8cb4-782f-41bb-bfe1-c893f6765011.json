He lives with his grandmother - only she calls him Jay - in isolated privilege on New York's Upper East Side: no television, no other kids, no Grandpa (he is off with his fancy woman elsewhere). Phoebe Selkirk is waspy and patrician, but she and her grandson are nevertheless locked in a needy embrace. At night, when she is dreaming her martini-induced dreams, her grey hair spread over the pillow like seaweed, he listens to her breathing, fearing that it may stop before 'they' come for him. Who? His parents, a pair of student radicals on the run from the FBI, whom he has not seen, save for in the tight bundle of newspaper cuttings he carries in his back pocket, since he was a baby. 'They will come for you, man,' says his long-haired, teenage neighbour. 'They'll break you out of here.' Che longs for this unlikely release, but he is only a boy: he lacks his parents' daring. Ideally, he'd like it to happen while Grandma is still around to wave him goodbye. Then one day, the lift doors open and there she is: he recognises her straight off, this creature with a khaki backpack, though he must call her not 'Mum', but Dial (short for 'dialectic'). The trouble is that Che's longing results in his making a mistake: Dial is not who she seems. This is the first and, I think, the most acceptable of the many misunderstandings on which His Illegal Self, Peter Carey's 10th novel, turns. A child without a mother can easily imagine one, especially if he has mythology on which to build (Susan Selkirk first made herself and her baby, Che, famous when, during the visit of the US Secretary for Defence Robert McNamara to Harvard University in 1966, she threw them both in front of his black Lincoln). But can a woman like Dial, who has just landed a longed-for job as an English professor at Vassar, imagine that doing a revolutionary whom she knew as a freshman a favour ('I was sort of wanting to say hi to my guy,' says Susan, America's most wanted woman, on the line from Philly. ' ... I mean my son.') will be without serious consequences? Of this, I am less convinced. Dial's sleepwalking into disaster (is it bravado that induces her to act or the class fury that sweeps over her when faced with Phoebe Selkirk's 'tailored' hair and her firm ways with shop assistants?) and the tangled events that follow it are, however, mostly just a plot device, a way of getting Dial and Che alone together, in a putrid hippy commune in the Queensland jungle. Occasionally, the story is told from her side - 'her mother would have died to see her genius in a dump like this' - but in the main it is Che who gives it to us: the adventure turned to muddle, the prison fled, only to be replaced with another, less comfortable cell. 'The afternoons were slow and thick as ants ... in the town he had a sneaky traitor's heart and he would stare like a maniac at anyone who glanced his way. It was not home, no matter what she called it, but sometimes he saw how it contained the parts of home he would rather have forgotten - the colour of sadness, the same light on the moss side of the trees.' Novels narrated by children are nearly always flawed and tiresome. But Che is as convincing a child as any I have found in the pages of a book: beady as a boy scout; innocent and yet so knowing; brimming with watery nostalgia for states he has never even known. Growing up with Grandma Selkirk, we're told, he had been treated like some kind of 'lovely insect, expected to know things through your feelers, by the kaleidoscope patterns in the others' eyes', and it is this Che who pulls the reader through the novel's long middle section, when Dial seems incapable of organising anything, bar the odd pan of tomato sauce. By Carey's ordinarily teeming standards, the commune is oddly rather lifeless, for all that he has given it a scattered cast of outlaws: a renegade called Trevor, who knows how to dig fox-holes and mulch cauliflowers; a hippy, Rebecca, who objects to Che's stray cat because it will kill native birds (told that either the cat or she and Che must go, Dial eventually breaks its neck, one of several moments when you wonder if she is sicker, more dumbly violent, than her Harvard degree suggests). Here, the tale is full of menace and vague despair - 'the forest around the huts was laced with narrow, winding trails, like veins in a creature as yet unnamed' - but it is also strangely without incident. Carey wants to show that it does not take a parent to love a child, nor a wholly good and clear-thinking person, and, as the novel reaches its sickly climax, there is no doubting that we believe in the emotional noose that binds Dial to her contraband charge. The impenetrable thickness of the jungle, however, somehow contrives to strangle Carey's natural vivacity as writer, just as it keeps Dial and Che hidden from prying eyes. Were it not for a couple of beautiful set pieces early on - Dial at her Vassar interview, in twinset and court shoes; Grandma Selkirk trying to mitigate the shame of her daughter's pregnancy with all sorts of generous offers to Harvard - His Illegal Self would be an impenetrable mystery. As it is, its opacity is both a virtue and a frustration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
