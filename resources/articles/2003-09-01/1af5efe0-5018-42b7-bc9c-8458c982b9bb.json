Milton Keynes want a football club because they have so many shops they think they deserve one. A football club would give the residents something to do between shops. In two years' time the plan is for the club to be playing not in a hockey stadium but in Stadium MK, 'part of a development which will include a new Asda Walmart Supercentre, DIY superstore, media village, 200-bed hotel, health and fitness centre, fast food restaurants and a petrol station'. Should be fun staying in the media village and reporting on petrol sales. Before the match some kids in replica shirts walked along the side of the stage and their parents videoed them for posterity. It was like a non-denominational nativity play. The start itself was delayed for 15 minutes 'to allow queuing supporters to get into the stadium'. Outside, there were two queues that would disgrace a 'Bush Rocks' stand at a Greenpeace fair. The postponement was in other words due not to demand but the manufacturing of demand. A fitting starting point for this mutant hybrid - Dons MK, MK: Dons, Dons: MK, MK Dons (punctuate it however you want). It provided time, delightfully, to read the opening efforts from Lee Scrivens, aka Scribbo, from the newspaper mk-news and dowhatinmk . The punctuation in Milton Keynes must be the worst in the country. Is it possible that every1 in MK talx in txt? 'I h8 MK.' 'I h8 MK 2' And they have found a friend in Scribbo who has also helped with the club's webzine - itsbeenemotional.com. Boys, if you can use a full stop between 'emotional' and 'com', why not between 'its' and 'been'? Anyhow, enough grammar, here's Scribbo uncut: 'You know life can be strange at times, forever full of fated twists mixed with pangs of de-ja-vu [sic], premonitions and a fair few predictions. If you ever needed proof of such an opinionated opening statement.' Hang on, Scribbo, call that opinionated? I'm confused. In fact I haven't been as lost since I had to make a mid-roundabout decision whether to go to Milton Keynes North, Milton Keynes South or Milton Keynes West, obviously chose wrong, and 37 roundabouts later returned to what may have been my starting-point. Back to Scribbo... 'Here I'm trying to write a passionate piece of literature [sic] regarding the city's immense date with destiny. I excitedly tap the keyboard; \"Football's come home\", but it is instantly deleted [a computer with in-built taste] as it's just too damn simple... 'So for once in my life I'm actually stuck for words [No, you're not, Scribbo, you're flying] and that in a way sort of says it all really. [No, really] Being speechless is not something I'm adhered to, yet the feeling of foreboding excitement is numbing the usual free flowing scribing senses. 'This is big.' Historic, Scribbo, the word of the day is historic. Just before kick-off, Pete Winkelman turned up on the pitch and was booed by the visiting Burnley supporters. He called it the proudest moment of his life. Well, as a pop promoter he's spent a lot of time with kiddie bands. It must have been nice to be among adults. Some clearly underage cheerleaders pom-pommed on to the pitch (perhaps they had failed the auditions for one of Winklepicker's bands). Then, finally, footballers. Who were given a standing ovation, which I think was genuine, although, personally, I would have evicted the lot for rising from their seats in direct contradiction of the signs reminding them that this is an arrestable offence in MK. The game began. And Wimbledon should have taken the lead if Albert Jarrett hadn't hesitated longer than a man weighing up the queuing options in Leather Sofa Direct. Instead, Burnley did when a Robbie Blake free-kick took a deflection that wrong-footed Paul Heald, whose attempts to make amends were slower than a Saturdays-only member of staff at Staples - The Office Superstore going to look if they have any stock 'out back'. There was a yellow card for European Cup winner David May (what a comedown for him to find himself playing between shopping centres). This was announced by the PA man, who hadn't bothered to give us the goalscorer. Maybe he's on a deal with the card manufacturers. Blake, with more space than you'd find on a quiet February Monday in Miller - The Electrical And Gas Superstore, scored a second. Before half time Patrick Agyemang, who had had a number of chances, attempted a bicycle- kick when one on one with the keeper. A decision which was as inexplicable as the spiel delivered by a man trying to sell you a digital camera in Currys. At half-time the PA man exhorted: 'Let's make some noise, it's the first time we've had professional football here.' A few people clapped. May received a second yellow card for hand-ball, thereby allowing himself an extra half an hour to go shopping at Brantano - Footwear. And in his absence, Burnley became confused. Rather irritatingly, the first goal scored for Wimbledon in Milton Keynes was from Dean Holdsworth, something of a hero for Wimbledon in their heyday, thereby affording them a specious piece of history they don't deserve. They equalised through Agyemang. And at last the home-away-from-home fans began to sing. Their first chant was 'You're not singing any more', which was an interesting debut number for the MK: Dons, Dons: MK or whatever. (All shops mentioned above overlook the National Hockey Stadium.) Afterwards, it is probable that both sets of teams and supporters went straight to *thecentre:mk to shop. '*thecentre:mk is [as its name suggests] in the heart of this thriving area [MK] which comprises the Snozone@Xcape, Art Gallery and Theatre District.' It includes giftcheque:mk which 'provides the perfect solution to those \"difficult to buy for\" people'. Milton Keynes started their campaign to purchase 'difficult to buy' football fans. 5,639 were enticed to come along. This figure will almost certainly fall. Let's hope so for this relocation is less a homecoming and more a kidnapping.
