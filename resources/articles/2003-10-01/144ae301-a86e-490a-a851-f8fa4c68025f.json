Kingdom Hospital, which King has written and executive produced, is based on cult mid-90s TV mini-series The Kingdom by Danish director Lars Von Trier, who went on to make his name with movies including Breaking the Waves and Festen. The supernatural drama is set in a modern hospital built on the site of an older medical institution and a mill, both destroyed by fire, that is haunted by ghosts. Kingdom Hospital features a cast that includes former 80s \"brat pack\" star Andrew McCarthy, Ed Begley Jnr, Bruce Davison and Diane Ladd. McCarthy plays a surgeon who lives in the hospital basement and collects medical equipment, while Ladd's character is a psychic hypochondriac who is a regular at Kingdom Hospital and Davison features as an inept, arrogant doctor. The 15-hour mini-series is due to launch on ABC in the US in February 2004 and will be broadcast on BBC2 and BBC3 in the UK later in the year. BBC2 has enjoyed considerable ratings success in the past couple of years with two Steven Spielberg-produced US mini-series - Band of Brothers, which followed a group of US soldiers during the second world war from D-Day to the end of the conflict in Europe, and UFO drama Taken. Kingdom Hospital is being made by US studio Sony, which also makes Dawson's Creek and The Shield. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
