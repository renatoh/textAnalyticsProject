When we last looked up their sleeves we speculated that some of the bad feeling might have been triggered by last year's blackballing of Spyros Melaris, and now that unseemly episode has mysteriously reappeared. Melaris is planning to sue over his dismissal, which was triggered following a spat with the then-president Michael Bailey and yet another falling out after asking council member John Fisher, a collector of magic memorabilia, if there was any conflict of interest in Fisher being in charge of selling the Circle's own collection. With that, the council made Melaris vanish and then the club's members voted to support the expulsion. Now Melaris claims that a precis detailing the case, which was sent by the council to Magic Circle members, was false, and that his human rights have been breached. He's suing the councillors who signed the letter and is asking for an apology and a reinstatement. If not, it's a trip down the Strand. \"I cannot and I will not go down in history as the member of the Magic Circle who was perceived to have done something wrong and was thrown out,\" fumes Melaris, who says Ali Bongo is in his corner. Developing, as they say. \u00b7 Surveillance: Australian academic Germaine Greer at the Edinburgh television festival a week last Saturday, watching the Ashes coverage from Trent Bridge. Germaine was cheering each Aussie wicket to fall. Lord Tebbit will be delighted. \u00b7 Just when Londoners are relaxing back into their complacent default security setting, along comes somebody with a product to flog intent on petrifying us all. Enter the Evactube, launched by Maida Vale resident Claire Baylin and her fiance Michael Martel, who are selling their life-saving device for \"only \u00a39.99\" (plus \u00a32.50 p&amp;p). The tube contains a respirator that protects against smoke and dust (and also bird flu and Sars!), water, a whistle, a glow stick and antiseptic wipes, all under the tag line: \"Everything you need to aid an escape\". Golly! Would this really have made a difference on July 7? \"I firmly believe in this product, so yes it would,\" gushes Claire, who brushes off accusations of scaremongering, but is more coy when it comes to sales queries. She'll only say that she's sold \"a few\" tubes, so on balance it seems she's lagging behind in the July 7 merchandising spin-off stakes. The leader seems to be those T-shirts sported by Asians riding the tube, which say: \"Don't Freak, I'm a Sikh\". A much better joke, we think. \u00b7 While we're on the subject, a colleague has a query about Hasib Hussain, the suicide bus bomber who supposedly ate a last meal at McDonald's before blowing up the No 30 on July 7. Is the McDonald's breakfast menu halal, he asks, and if not how it will affect Hasib's day of judgment? Apparently McDonald's doesn't offer halal food in the UK, which really should launch an occasional Diary series: He'd Almost Thought of Everything. Still, we won't dwell for too long on the irony of it all here. \u00b7 Promotional offer of the week goes (already) to the pizza company, Papa John's, which delivered flyers to the Orpington area over the weekend. \"Win a family holiday,\" they entice, \"to New Orleans.\" \u00b7 And finally, here's columnist Tim Hames in the Times in May 2004. \"In little more than a year's time Iraq will be enjoying an unprecedented economic boom and be witness to a degree of political pluralism unknown in the Middle East,\" he wrote. \"News of such success, when it occurs, will not, unfortunately, be plastered over the front pages.\" Mystifying. \u00b7 diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
