Holloway's men could still reach the play-offs this season if they build on this 4-3 win, but George Graham and Jim Smith have been suggested as possibilities to take over at Loftus Road. \"We already have more points than we did at this exact point this time last year with a game in hand,\" the Rangers manager said. \"But that doesn't seem to be good enough for some people. \"I'm sick and tired of every Tom, Dick and Harry getting linked with my job every day. Well, ding, dang, doo. It's my job, I own it and it's up to anyone else to take it off me. I'm proud of my players, of what we are doing here and what we are trying to achieve and that's all that matters.\" They started the slower here as Crewe carved out an opening inside the first minute but Eddie Johnson sent a right-foot volley wide of Simon Royce's goal. QPR hit back quickly, however, and Ross Turnbull in the Crewe goal had to be on his toes to keep out a long-range effort from Shabazz Baidoo two minutes later. Baidoo threatened again soon after, but was again denied by Turnbull as both sides contributed fully to an entertaining opening spell. Royce then had to be at his best after 10 minutes as he somehow denied Johnson, brilliantly parrying the Crewe striker's fiercely struck shot. But they took the lead after 15 minutes when Steve Jones drove in from the right and cut the ball back to Johnson, who planted the ball in the corner from 12 yards. Rangers were fuming three minutes later when the referee waved away strong claims for a penalty after Darren Moss appeared to have handled in the box. In the 34th minute Steve Jones stung the gloves of Royce with a ferocious drive but three minutes later the visitors were ahead. First, Moss was robbed by Lee Cook, who drove unchallenged into the Crewe box before unleashing a left-foot shot across and beyond Turnbull. Then, 60 seconds later, Gareth Ainsworth's cross fell to Baidoo, who turned the ball into the net from six yards. Dario Gradi immediately threw on Luke Varney for Johnson and the substitution paid instant dividends. He latched on to Steve Jones' flick on and coolly fired past Royce to restore parity. The game took another turn on the stroke of half-time when Gary Roberts cut the ball back to Steve Jones whose poor shot luckily fell to Billy Jones to bundle home and put Alex ahead again. But Rangers came out fighting and Martin Rowlands levelled with a 35-yard shot 12 minutes in and Richard Langley scored his second of the season with nine minutes of the game to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
