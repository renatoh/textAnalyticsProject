With the brief assistance of Stuart MacGill and then McGrath's more protracted stay at the crease, Hussey struck a polished 122 - his third Test century - before being the last man out. South Africa replied positively after the frustration, making 169 for the loss of their openers AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith. De Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs, who is not out, made half-centuries. The tourists had dismissed Hussey's overnight partner MacGill early on to leave Australia struggling at 249 for nine before McGrath joined him. \"You have to give a lot of credit to the No10 and No11 batsmen, because they're the ones under the most pressure,\" said Hussey, who had scored an unbeaten 133 against West Indies at the Adelaide Oval last month with MacGill holding up the other end. \"I'm the one trying to shield them and take as many balls I can,\" he added. \"I guess they're not well noted for their batting and, if they can stay in there for a long time and face a lot of balls, then we can frustrate the opposition for as long as possible. It is a partnership at the end of the day. You do need the bloke at the other end standing in there and having the courage to take it as well.\" Hussey, who made his Test debut this year against West Indies and is averaging 94, said he had not even thought about another century when McGrath arrived. \"I must admit when Glenn came to the crease I was 27 or something and I didn't think I'd be able to score a hundred,\" he said. \"I think it wasn't until I was 91 or 92 that I thought maybe I could.\" He said there had been nerve-racking moments when he smashed a six off Nicky Boje to move to 97. McGrath had to see out six balls from Andre Nel after Hussey then failed to take a single off the last ball. \"I played a ball to [wicketkeeper Mark] Boucher when I was 97 and he said, 'Oh Huss, what have you done? But Glenn played well. He kept the over out from Andre Nel and Glenn did say to me thank goodness he got through that over because it gave me the chance to get 100.\" Hussey, who was dropped on 27 by Jacques Kallis at second slip as part of a poor fielding display in which 10 chances were put down, said he felt the match was evenly poised as the pitch was taking spin and showing signs of variable bounce. \"If we can take some wickets tomorrow, we'll be in with a chance,\" he said. But so far the wickets have fallen to the pacemen and Shaen Warne's 12 overs have cost 40."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
