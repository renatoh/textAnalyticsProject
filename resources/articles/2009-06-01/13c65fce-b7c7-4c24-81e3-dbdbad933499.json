Kenny Rogers Liposuction and a botched facelift mean that - unlike almost every other middle-American male - he no longer looks remotely like Kenny Rogers. 2. Kylie Minogue Transformed herself from girl-next-door Charlene to SexKylie in the judicious flash of a pair of minuscule, gold hot pants. 3. Morrissey Morphed from a pasty, puny gladioli-botherer to the muscle-bound, Tom-of-Finland Adonis adorning 1992's Your Arsenal. Spring-heeled gym? 4. David Bowie Pop's most famous, fag-stained vampiric fangs were replaced by a new set of pearly whites. What next, matching eyes? 5. Elton John Bald by his late 20s, Reg eventually ditched the ostentatious hats in favour of a luxurious, ludicrously glossy \"honky cat\" thatch perched atop his pate. 6. Paul McCartney The most sinister symptom of Ms Mills's malign influence was the desperate russet tint that crept over his moptop. 7. Courtney Love New lips, new breasts, new nose. Widow Cobain seems trapped in a perpetual cycle of surgery that almost evokes nostalgia for that skaggy \"natural\" look. 8. Thom Yorke His current artfully neurotic stylings are a million miles from his early flirtation with bleached frightwig and hair extensions. 9. Michael Jackson The makeover as Dante's Inferno: the cherubic black boy who sang ABC and the pale, skeletal man-child with the cleft chin appear not to share a shred of DNA. 10. Shane MacGowan New gnashers transformed his mouth from the Dartford Tunnel into the Thames flood barrier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
