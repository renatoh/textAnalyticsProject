Whatever happened to Sin City?", "bodyText": "\"I think it's safe to say that no one has ever called Rupert Murdoch a tree hugger,\" said Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, in a speech the other day. Yet Murdoch had committed his companies \"to a major sustainability initiative\" that would dramatically reduce their carbon emissions. \"The question is, why is he doing this?\" asked the mayor. \"And I think the answer is simple. He cares about the world he's going to leave to his children, and he recognises that 'going green' is really about using energy more efficiently, which saves money and drives up profits.\" Another answer could be that Murdoch is just swimming with the tide of fashion that is inexorably driving this dirty old town into becoming a paragon of \"green\" virtue. Bloomberg is, like Murdoch, a billionaire and a passionate believer in free markets, but he doesn't find this difficult to reconcile with being a rabid interventionist determined to turn New York into \"the first environmentally sustainable 21st-century city\". And to this end he has proposed 127 different projects, including a Ken Livingstone-style congestion charge for Manhattan, the planting of a million trees, the replacement of New York's taxi fleet with fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, and the cultivation of mussels to suck pollution out of the rivers. I am sure these are all very good ideas, but it is not the way we like to imagine New York. This is supposed to be Sin City, the home of everything bad and glamorous, and it's very disconcerting to see hoods of evil appearance standing outside low dives at four in the morning in order to have a cigarette on the sidewalk. This is rapidly turning into Prig City, where it is unthinkable to smoke anywhere in public, to allow your dog to make a mess without clearing it up, or to fail to recycle your rubbish. Even having a glass of wine at lunch is now looked on askance. I am staying with friends just off Union Square, which has a farmers' market four days a week, selling organic produce from farms outside the city. I wandered through it yesterday morning and passed the stand of the Hawthorne Valley Farm, which claimed that its vegetables, cakes and jars of sauerkraut were not only organic but also \"certified biodynamic\". Being hopelessly ignorant in this area, I asked a man behind the counter what biodynamic meant. He set my mind reeling with talk about cosmic influences on agriculture. How, I wondered, did these affect the production of sauerkraut? I was leaving for the subway station when a German woman stopped me and said she had overheard our conversation and that I had been misinformed about the true nature of biodynamism. But she left me none the wiser as she rabbited on about the need to plant vegetables according to the phases of the moon, not realising that this is nothing new - Mediterranean peasants have been doing it for centuries. \u00b7 Bloomberg is being urged to join next year's race for the White House as an independent candidate, and he is reportedly prepared to spend at least $1bn of his own money on the campaign. With such resources he might even be in with a chance, but the current favourite to succeed George Bush remains Hillary Clinton. This has given rise to much speculation about the role that her husband, Bill, would play in a Hillary administration. He would be not only the first male consort of a president of the United States but also the first one to have been president himself - and as such would enjoy the same right as his wife to be greeted by a band playing \"Hail to the Chief!\" as he enters a room. He would also be entitled, as are all ex-presidents, to be addressed as \"Mr President\", so the waiter bringing in the Clintons' morning coffee would presumably say \"Good morning, Mr President\" as well as \"Good morning, Madam President\" as he puts down the tray. We could be in for an orgy of sycophancy. Hillary hasn't promised \"two for the price of one\", as Bill misguidedly did during his first presidential election campaign, but she has said he would serve her as a \"global ambassador\". Some people see this as Hillary's way of saying that she would like to keep him out of Washington as much as possible, for his presence in the White House could easily become oppressive. He would be a huge political presence in the background to her presidency. He has kept a low profile in her campaign so far, but it is hard to see how he could fail to throw his weight around when they are both safely ensconced in the White House. On the other hand, Hillary may well need a \"global ambassador\" to repair the damage wrought by Bush on America's relations with her allies, and nobody could fill the role better than Bill Clinton. \u00b7 One thing Bill won't do for sure is to make any public criticisms of the incumbent president, as Jimmy Carter did of President Bush last week. Carter was held to have behaved very badly by breaking the convention that former presidents always speak respectfully of their successors, for he described the Bush administration in an interview as \"the worst in history\". Such was the furore, that Carter subsequently tried to take back his remarks, saying they had been \"careless or misinterpreted\" and that he had not been \"talking personally about any president\". He did not, however, see any reason to modify in any way his criticisms of Tony Blair, whose subservience to Bush on Iraq he had called \"a major tragedy for the world\". \u00b7 This week Alexander visited the Frick Collection in New York: \"Surely the most pleasant and most manageable of the world's great art galleries.\" He read Day of the Dandelion: \"Peter Pringle's gripping botanical thriller about evil goings-on in the GM food industry is just out in America but, strangely, still seeks a British publisher.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
