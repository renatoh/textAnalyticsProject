In the past decade of the competition there have been 12 goalless draws in the first legs of knockout matches and seven times the team who played away from home first have gone on to win the tie. In 1994-95 Ajax beat Hajduk Split 3-0 in Amsterdam following a scoreless quarter-final first leg and beat Bayern Munich 5-2 at home after a 0-0 draw in Germany in the semis on their way to the title. The following season Legia Warsaw were held at home by Panathinaikos before losing the quarter-final away leg 3-0. The 1997-98 competition saw the first 0-0 draw after 180 minutes between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in the quarter-finals, Dortmund edging through 1-0 at home after extra-time in the second leg. Valencia dumped Leeds United out at the semi-final stage in the 2000-01 season, following up a 0-0 draw at Elland Road with a 3-0 win at the Mestalla Stadium. Milan drew 0-0 against Ajax in the 2002-03 quarter-finals before winning 3-2 in Italy, and in the last 16 last season drew 0-0 with Sparta Prague, before a 4-1 victory at San Siro. Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho, however, certainly has recent history on his side. Mourinho's former charges Porto were held 0-0 at home by Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in the first leg of their semi-final last season but went on to win 1-0 in Spain on their way to lifting the trophy. The only other side to have won the away leg after a home stalemate were Real Madrid in 1999-2000 when they triumphed 3-2 at Old Trafford in the quarter-final, second leg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
