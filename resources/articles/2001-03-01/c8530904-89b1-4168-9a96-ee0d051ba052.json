The party's pro-Europeans, a rare breed these days, looked on in dismay as Mr Hague lurched further to the right with his warning that Labour would turn Britain into a \"foreign land\". \"This speech is going to do nothing to reach out to the centre ground,\" a Europhile Tory said. \"This is all we need as we head into an election.\" If Mr Hague had his eyes genuinely set on Downing Street, the Europhile's criticisms would have been justified. Elections, as Labour learned so painfully, tend to be won on the centre ground. In the face of repeatedly dire opinion polls, however, the Tory leadership has privately abandoned any hope of victory and is concentrating instead on shoring up its core base. Central Office strategists calculate that if enough lifelong Tories - 2m of whom stayed at home in 1997 - turn out on polling day, then Mr Hague should win back enough seats to set his sights on a victory at the election after next. Any doubts that Mr Hague might try to take the battle to the centre ground were quickly dispelled when he dismissed health and education in a few paragraphs of his speech. Instead, he devoted an entire page to asylum seekers, and more than a page to grim warnings about how Tony Blair's enthusiasm for Europe would destroy Britain. After delegates were shown a video of the prime minister, accompanied by funereal music, Mr Hague issued his chilling warning as he invoked Rupert Brooke. \"Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair,\" he said. \"The Royal Mint melting down pound coins as the euro notes start to circulate. Our currency gone forever ... The jail doors opening as thousands more serious criminals walk out early to offend again.\" Warming to his theme, Mr Hague launched a highly personal attack on the prime minister, accusing him of feeling embarrassed at being British. \"If there's one thing that sets me apart from Tony Blair, it's this: I'm not embarrassed to articulate the instincts of the people of our country,\" he said. \"The governing of this country has drifted far away from the decent, plain speaking common sense of its people. It's time to bring it back. It's time to bring Britain home.\" A Labour victory, Mr Hague declared, would remove the need for further elections because Mr Blair would allow Brussels to take over Britain. In an attempt to win back anti-Europeans, who may be tempted to vote for the UK Independence Party, threatening key Tory marginal seats, Mr Hague said: \"I appeal to all those people who may not have voted Conservative before but who believe in an independent Britain. At this coming election, lend us your vote. Vote for us this time so that your vote will mean something next time, and the time after, and the time after that.\" Tory officials denied that Mr Hague was playing the race card, because they said that his warning of a \"foreign land\" did not apply to asylum seekers. But Mr Hague is acutely aware that such a term is highly loaded and will be used to characterise his entire speech. His remarks on asylum also struck a shrill tone. He was careful to make clear that Britain should offer protection to people fleeing persecution, saying: \"We should make Britain a safe haven but not a soft touch.\" But he warned of \"immediate deportion\" for anyone whose asylum claim was rejected, a process that will take weeks under the Tories, and he lambasted illegal asylum seekers who had \"elbowed aside\" genuine applicants. Mr Hague's supporters left Harrogate last night delighted that their leader had once again made waves with a headline-grabbing speech. Other Tories were left wondering whether Michael Portillo had sensed where the future lies. The shadow chancellor made clear his unequivocal opposition to the euro over the weekend, but he did so in less strident terms. His performance even won a standing ovation from the pro-European Mainstream group. Speech was by hardline columnist Daniel Hannan, a hardline Eurosceptic Tory MEP, has been drafted in as one of William Hague's main speech writers for the general election, signalling a further move to the right by the leadership. He had his first outing in the speech yesterday by Mr Hague, which bore similarities to recent articles and speeches Mr Hannan has written. Even his critics acknowledge that Mr Hannan is an eloquent writer, one whose grasp of history will, Tory central office hopes, add some weight to Mr Hague's speeches. A controversial figure, Mr Hannan has come close to suggesting that Britain should withdraw from the European Union. Pro-European Tories are likely to react to the appointment of the Daily Telegraph columnist with dismay. Last year he raised more than \u00a3100,000 to help the \"no\" camp in the Danish euro referendum campaign. Mr Hannan is being brought into central office to replace Danny Finkelstein and George Osborne, Mr Hague's main speech writers, who are fighting seats in the general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
