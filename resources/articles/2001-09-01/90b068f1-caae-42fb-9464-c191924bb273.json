Major Charles Ingram from Wiltshire scooped the jackpot on an edition of the show that has yet to be broadcast. He is the third contestant to win a \u00a31m prize. But Scotland Yard's special inquiry team were called in after ITV and the series producer, Celador, became suspicious that a friend in the audience may have helped Major Ingram by using a \"coughing code\". Tonight, Major Ingram threatened to take Celador to court for \"destroying his reputation\". In a statement released through his solicitor, Morgan Cole, he denied cheating and challenged the company to produce evidence against him. It said: \"He is stunned, bewildered and devastated at the action that has been taken and feels that the effects leave his career in the army and livelihood in tatters. \"In the circumstances, Major Ingram has stated he will do all in his power to fully protect his legal position and restore his reputation within the army and with his family and friends. \"Mr Ingram, a major in the Engineers, is known to be of impeccable character.\" The firm of solicitors said Major Ingram would start proceedings against Celador if the company failed to produce any evidence against him by 4pm tomorrow. It said Major Ingram: \"strenuously denied he was part of any irregularity in any stage before or during the course of his entry into the competition\". A spokeswoman for the ministry of defence said: \"It is a matter of investigation for Scotland Yard. \"He [Major Ingram] has not been suspended or removed from his job. That would not be our process. He is innocent until proven guilty.\" Tonight, Major Ingram and his wife refused to add to the solicitor's statement. Major Ingram's wife, Diana, 37, had previously told newspapers she and her brother had won \u00a332,000 each on the show earlier in the year. \"Our family has had quite a bit of luck on the show,\" she said. \"We all love it. We will continue to watch it every time it's on because we enjoy it so much.\" Mrs Ingram has written a book, Win a Million!, which unveils the methods that enabled her and her brother, Adrian Pollock, to succeed on the programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
