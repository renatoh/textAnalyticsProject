The Russian champions may pose a greater threat in Wednesday\u2019s return but will know the same is undoubtedly true of Liverpool. A point at Spartak Moscow\u2019s raucous home \u2013 where Sevilla fell to a 5-1 defeat the following month \u2013 was not a bad return for Liverpool. It was, however, a poor reflection of their dominance over Massimo Carrera\u2019s side and in keeping with the early-season pattern of wasted chances and punished mistakes. Liverpool had 17 shots on goal to the home side\u2019s three that night and converted only one, through Philippe Coutinho, with Spartak\u2019s substitute goalkeeper, Aleksandr Selikhov, inspired in the closing stages. The pattern has now been broken, as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion were the latest opponents to discover on Saturday, and only Paris Saint-Germain had scored more than Liverpool\u2019s 16 goals in the Champions League group stage going into the final set of matches. Unless Spartak become the first away team to win at Anfield this season, it will be Spartak who have cause to rue a lost opportunity. \u201cThey have three very important offensive players back in Promes, Z\u00e9 Lu\u00eds and Denis Glushakov,\u201d said Klopp, returning to the theme of his post-match analysis in Moscow. \u201cGlushakov is an experienced runner from midfield, always running in behind. Promes is like Sadio Man\u00e9. He can shoot very quick and is a proper striker. That makes it different of course. But we are different. We are in another moment. We need to have confidence and use our stadium. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can order it but if I could order it then this would be a good moment for Anfield to be at its best. That is what I am looking for. It is special. We played there and drew and we were the better side, we had more chances, and now they bring back three important players. That is a fantastic side in a good moment. If someone has decided we are already through then Moscow may think of their impressive win versus Sevilla. I see this as an opportunity.\u201d Man\u00e9, an unused substitute at Brighton, claims Liverpool are capable of \u201cbeating any team in the world\u201d and will be a side to avoid should they reach the last 16 for the first time since 2008-09. After the experience of conceding three second-half goals in Sevilla, however, and squandering the chance to win the group with a game to spare, he admits there can be no loss of focus against Spartak. \u201cThis is one of the biggest games in the season for us,\u201d the Liverpool forward said. \u201cIt is the dream of every player in the world to play in the Champions League and very important for us. The fans deserve it, the club also. Liverpool is a big and great club and we want to play a big part in the Champions League. We want to go as far as we can. We going to try to do our best and cause as many problems as we can for the defenders.\u201d For Klopp, there is no point disguising the magnitude of a match he describes as a \u201cfinal\u201d and an \u201call or nothing\u201d occasion. His team have got this far by delivering in similar circumstances against Hoffenheim in the play-off and Middlesbrough on the final day of last season, after all. \u201cThere is pressure and we cannot ignore it, we are going for something big,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cWe had it against Middlesbrough and Hoffenheim and we did it quite well so far and have to do it again. But Spartak are a good side. I cannot ignore that. They have their own targets. They rested three or four players in the last game and still won. They have one more game and then a three-month break. They have their targets and we have ours.\u201d Liverpool know victory would secure a place in the knockout stage as group winners and a draw will also suffice for qualification, although Klopp is adamant his team cannot and will not play for a point. The equation is more straightforward for Spartak: win at Anfield or enter the Europa League. Carrera\u2019s team may be more committed to attack as a consequence and leave more space at the back for Liverpool to exploit but Klopp suspects they will not adopt that approach from the first whistle. He said: \u201cIf I knew 100% how they will start the game I will say yes, it does suit us. They must attack and it can cause us problems if we do not defend well. We can have counterattacks and everyone is saying we are brilliant at counterattacks. We scored some nice goals, that is true, but we have to do our job. \u201cWe are a possession team. We will have the ball and must have an idea for that and perfect protection as the game develops. Do we go 1-0 up and they go like crazy, or 1-0 down and then what does that mean? We need to be ready for a 95-minute game and fight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
