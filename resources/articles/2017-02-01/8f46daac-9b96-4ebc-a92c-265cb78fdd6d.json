The then 20-year-old, from Sandbach in Cheshire, was staying in Malia with friends \u2013 his first holiday without his family \u2013 in 2005 and was last seen in a bar asking for directions to his hotel after leaving a pub alone. Despite appeals broadcast on British and Greek television the student was never found but Cheshire police said on Friday that the Greek authorities had confirmed to them that the remains were Cook\u2019s following the conclusion of a forensic examination. Workmen called Greek police after they found a skeleton, disposable camera and belt while cleaning out the well last Thursday with the remains then removed by authorities and taken to a nearby hospital for testing. Detective Inspector Gary McIntyre of Cheshire police said: \u201cThis is understandably an extremely upsetting and distressing time for the Cook family. Steven\u2019s relatives are very appreciative of all the support the media and the public have given them over the years in their quest to find him but they have asked for their privacy to be respected at this time, as they are trying to come to terms with the news.\u201d In a post on the Find Steven Cook Facebook group, the family said they would be bringing their son home to say their \u201cfarewells\u201d. They wrote: \u201cHaving a loved one go missing is a vacuum full of pain. If they are no longer with us then the idle mind imagines horrors of \u2018what ifs\u2019 in order to account for them being alive and not in touch. \u201cKnowing that Steve is now coming home is an end to all of that and the fog can lift at last. Our memories of him finally released without being accompanied by the horrific mental images, feelings and type of thoughts that can easily destroy you. \u201cIn getting Steve home then we have truly found him again, and he will now continue to live through the shared memories of all [who] knew him.\u201d The family thanked the police and several media outlets as well as friends and volunteers for their help in the search. They had renewed their appeal for information about Cook in 2015 to mark the tenth anniversary of his disappearance with his parents putting up a reward of \u20ac7,000 (\u00a35,900). Several sightings of a man matching Cook\u2019s description emerged in the months after the initial appeal in 2005 \u2013 which included a wide-ranging search of the island \u2013 had led the family to believe he may still have been alive. Cheshire police said their first priority was to have the remains flown back to the UK as soon as possible, with Greek authorities remaining in charge of the investigation into his death, although it is not yet clear if it is a murder inquiry. McIntyre added: \u201cIt is important to remember that the discovery of Steven\u2019s body is being managed by the Greek authorities, who have had primacy for this case since Steven was first reported missing and they will continue to liaise with us moving forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
