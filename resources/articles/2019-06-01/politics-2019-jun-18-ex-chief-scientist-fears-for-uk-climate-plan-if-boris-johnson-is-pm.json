King was serving as the UK special representative for climate change when Johnson was appointed foreign secretary. He told the Guardian that Johnson\u2019s term in office coincided with a 60% cut in his team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to just 65. \u201cThe cuts began with the new incoming permanent secretary, which was just before Boris Johnson in early 2016,\u201d King said. But Johnson did not stop or reverse the cuts. \u201cThe cuts were devastating because it was just at the point that we had to deliver the Paris agreement.\u201d They meant the UK lost its global leadership role in climate negotiations, King added. In a one-to-one meeting in 2017, when King was about leave his post, Johnson claimed he knew nothing about the reduction in posts and urged King not to go public with his concerns. Recalling the conversation after raising the 60% cut, King said: \u201cHe said something like: \u2018Good God, I didn\u2019t know that.\u2019 He then said: \u2018You\u2019re not going to spill this all out to the media?\u2019\u201d King, who had to sign a two-year non-disclosure agreement when he left the government in March 2017, agreed not to talk to the media about the issue if no more cuts were made. In return he said Johnson gave him a \u201cwonderful farewell speech at the Foreign Office praising me for doing more on climate change than any other individual\u201d. King said there was a mismatch between Johnson\u2019s commitments in private and his lack of public commitment on the climate crisis, which have continued in the current leadership campaign. He said: \u201cDuring his time in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson never made a speech on climate change \u2026 There was a contrast between Johnson\u2019s farewell speech to me and his action. I really tried to encourage him to make speeches on climate change and it never transpired.\u201d Asked if he was worried by Johnson\u2019s friendship with the climate denier Donald Trump, King said: \u201cAren\u2019t we all? It\u2019s extremely concerning.\u201d He added: \u201cThe issue of Boris Johnson and climate change has not been clarified so far in the discussion around the leadership of the Conservative party. \u201cIt would give me tremendous comfort to know that we do have a prime minister coming in who is prepared to stick to a commitment on climate change. That\u2019s been an all-party commitment since 2008. It could come undone by simply not saving anything or by reducing our ability to deliver which is really what happened in the Foreign Office. And in that process explicitly ignoring this enormous challenge to civilisation.\u201d He also claimed that Johnson misled the public during his time as London mayor about King\u2019s agreement to chair an inquiry into building a London airport in the Thames estuary. King said he backed using islands in the Thames to protect London from flooding, adding: \u201cI said I\u2019m happy to look at the future use of the Thames estuary, but I said we\u2019ve got to take care of rising sea levels, you can\u2019t start constructing large cities\u2019 terminuses if you are then going to be faced with future flooding. \u201cHe stepped out to the media and said: \u2018Sir David has agreed to chair the commission into the future of an airport in the Thames estuary,\u2019 literally minutes after we had reached that agreement. My report saying we shouldn\u2019t do it was never published.\u201d Asked if Johnson had been dishonest he said: \u201cThere is no other word for it. When I challenged him he hit the top of his head and said: \u2018Oh God, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do that.\u2019 Of course he meant it.\u201d King, who was chief scientific adviser under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, also revealed he was repeatedly blocked from talking to the media during his second stint in government as climate envoy under David Cameron and Theresa May. He said: \u201cWhen I was brought back, William Hague \u2013 then foreign secretary \u2013 said we need you back as a talking head, because we need to get the information out to the public on climate change. The week after I had requests from the media to appear. And virtually every single request was turned out. The turning down was not from the communications office in the Foreign Office or from Hague, but from No 10. So, I am assuming that whoever was advising No 10 on their political campaigning must have been saying that climate change is not a vote-winner.\u201d King added: \u201cIt was absurd. Here was Britain doing more than almost the rest of the world put together on this issue and I\u2019m kept off the public airwaves.\u201d A spokesman for Johnson pointed to comments he had made to the ConservativeHome website. When asked if the UK should set a zero carbon target by 2050, Johnson said: \u201cYes we should set ourselves a challenging target. Even if it looks tough to deliver today, the technology is changing and improving the whole time. I believe in the Promethean power of the human race to solve its problems \u2013 and Britain can be in the lead in coming up with the answers. When I was mayor of London we saw huge growth in population and GDP, and yet cut CO2 by 14%.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
