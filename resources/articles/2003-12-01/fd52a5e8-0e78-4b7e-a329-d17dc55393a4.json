Yesterday Dean Richards, the director of rugby at Leicester, launched a well-aimed broadside at the fixture. The televised match will fill Twickenham but the Premiership clubs also have games this weekend and have been affected by call-ups even though Clive Woodward has been limited to a maximum of three players from each of the 12 leading sides and despite only four players who started the World Cup final against Australia last month - Jason Robinson, Ben Cohen, Trevor Woodman and Richard Hill - being included in England's starting XV. Richards accused the Premiership clubs of \"selling their soul\" by agreeing to the fixture. Leicester meet their East Midlands rivals Northampton tomorrow, the only two clubs who voted against the hastily arranged encounter. Leicester have lost Martin Corry, Ollie Smith and Daryl Gibson, and Richards claimed that the former All Blacks centre Gibson, on Barbarians duty, did not want to play but was put under pressure to take part. \"Yet again we go into a game disrupted even further by an England side playing a New Zealand side. It's something we could have done without,\" Richards said. \"Whether it is Daryl Gibson with New Zealand, or Ollie Smith and Martin Corry with England, it's three quality players we could have done with. It's the price you pay for selling your soul. \"We were delighted to have everyone back and no sooner are they back than they go away again. As much as Leicester try to put some sense into the season, whoever has organised this game - Premier Rugby or England - there doesn't seem to be much sense behind it. I am not frustrated. It's a fact of life now that we don't have our players for so many days in a season. We are used to it.\" The Leeds hooker Mark Regan is England's latest casualty. He misses the game with a foot injury, giving an opportunity to Sale's Andy Titterrell. Andy Long, capped in Woodward's first match as coach against Australia six years ago, joins the replacements. The former Tonga captain Tevita Taumoepeau will play for Northampton until the end of the season as a replacement for the injured French prop Renaud Peillard. The club's former England wing Jon Sleightholme is to retire as a professional on New Year's Eve. England's World Cup players Will Greenwood and Jason Leonard make their return to the Premiership arena with Harlequins at Sale tonight. Greenwood starts at Edgeley Park and Leonard is among the replacements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
