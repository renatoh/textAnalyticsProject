It involves triumph and heartache as a player at Italia 90; success, more heartache and a row that is enshrined in World Cup folklore as a manager in 2002. Despite the turbulent narrative he envies all those about to follow suit in South Africa. Up to a point. \"The World Cup doesn't have as much excitement as when you are a player or a manager, although it doesn't have the same level of fear either,\" McCarthy says. \"I can enjoy this one a bit more watching other people suffer.\" The Wolverhampton Wanderers manager will be a Guardian columnist during this tournament, along with working for the BBC's commentary team in South Africa. Few are better placed to provide an insight into the pressures afflicting the 32 coaches and 736 players about to go to work on African soil. McCarthy reached the unchartered territory of the quarter-final stage with Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland in 1990. Twelve years later he was denied a return to the last eight only by a penalty shoot-out defeat to Spain, going home unbeaten in four games and cursing Ian Harte's spot-kick miss against Iker Casillas in normal time. But of course it is the Roy Keane affair that will forever be associated with McCarthy whenever the World Cup is mentioned. When the subject of having to send his captain home in 2002 is broached at our pre-World Cup meeting in London, it appears, for one interminable pause that this could be a short-lived association. McCarthy has no wish to reopen that controversy and it is, to be fair, four years since he and Keane were publicly reconciled as managers of Wolves and Sunderland respectively. That fallout did, however, help shape McCarthy as a manager and grants him perspective on whatever unexpected trials befall Fabio Capello or his 31 counterparts. \"Somebody said to me after it happened that I should have had contingency plans in place,\" McCarthy recalls. \"I'd like to meet the man who had contingency plans for that. It just doesn't happen. That was a unique pressure, but we are all under pressure \u2013 players have expectations too \u2013 and as a manager you have to deal with them all. You are managing everyone else's expectations and trying to protect the players from that while ultimately trying to get results. No matter what is going on around you, you have to got to get results.\" McCarthy does not have to revisit events prior to Ireland's last World Cup campaign for evidence of the intense demands on international managers over the next four weeks. He adds: \"Instead of going back you can look at Rio Ferdinand or one of the other teams that has lost a star player for this World Cup. If the manager goes to the press and bemoans his luck at losing the player, says this is so bad and we can't cope without him, then what impact does that have on the rest of the players? My view is he has gone, we are sorry to lose you, but let's forget it and concentrate on who is going to play. \"You can manage without a player. It's nonsense to say otherwise. There is not one player that a team cannot do without. The only time a team cannot cope without one player is when they are allowed to think that. A manager cannot allow that to happen. Can you imagine England, for example, going home after the first round and saying it was because Rio went home? It's not going to happen.\" McCarthy has won two Football League Championships with Sunderland and Wolves. He has suffered the misery of relegation and play-off defeats too. Little compares to the weight of managing a nation's expectations on the world stage, however. \"The only thing that comes close for a Premier League manager would be having three games to stay up,\" he says. \"I don't even think having three games to qualify for the next round of the Champions League would bring the same pressures. If you are relegated from the Premier League you are out of it for 12 months. If you get knocked out of the World Cup it is four years before you get another chance. And as a manager at a World Cup you are unlikely to get another chance.\" The former Barnsley, Manchester City, Celtic, Lyon and Millwall centre-half was a mainstay of the Republic team who reached the last eight in 1990, when they were beaten by the host nation Italy. Even that, he admits, did not totally prepare him for managing the country in Japan and South Korea. McCarthy says: \"The intensity of the World Cup came as a bit of a surprise, even though I'd played in a World Cup, but there was a reason for the intensity of it. We landed in Japan, it had been dealt with, and we'd already decided that I wasn't going to talk about it. At our first press conference the press officer, Brendan McKenna, God rest his soul, announced that Mick would not be talking about the matter, it had been dealt with, and it's not going to make things better by Mick talking about Roy. \"The first question was 'What about Roy Keane?' I politely declined to answer, but it went on and on and on. It is difficult, but me being the central focus of it all probably took a lot away from our players. I'm sure it did. There was more attention given to the player who wasn't there than the players who were, and the manager. In terms of the players handling the pressure of a World Cup, maybe that did us a favour. I don't know. There was a great togetherness with us.\" The Wolves manager dismisses the anguished debates over England's formation against the USA, the unconvincing warm-up displays and the furore over Wayne Rooney's dissent against Platinum Stars on Monday as an irrelevance. Or, to put it in his typically blunt manner: \"It's all crap. It's all tittle-tattle until the tournament starts. As much as our preparations were interrupted in 2002, just as England's has been now, as Portugal's has and the Ivory Coast's has, the best time is when the World Cup starts and you play that first game.\" McCarthy's first game at this World Cup will be Saturday's clash of styles, cultures and, potentially, managers; Argentina versus Nigeria in Johannesburg. His great hope for this tournament is for a breakthrough for African football. \"I don't get wrapped up in where it is held, more in the World Cup itself,\" he adds. \"What will be expected of the first World Cup in Africa is an African team pushing to be winners. It might be an African team's best possible chance to win it on home soil and it is a real shame that many of them have injury problems and difficult group draws. \"I don't see South Africa as a team who can win it but the Ivory Coast have some terrific players and I actually think Sven [-Goran Eriksson] might just rub a few noses in it. Sven has got something, he wouldn't have been where he's been and achieved what he has if he didn't, and, if [Didier] Drogba is fit, they can do something. They have a very difficult group with Brazil, Portugal and North Korea, but I fancy the Ivory Coast to get out of it. If Drogba is playing I think the Ivory Coast can qualify at Portugal's expense.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
