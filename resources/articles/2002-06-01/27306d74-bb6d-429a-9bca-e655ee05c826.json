Lawyers acting for Mr Deayton claimed that recent events demonstrated that he is in fact a terrible influence on young people. Mr Justice Thompson went on to win the second set 6-4. Mick Jagger A pre-emptive injunction granted to the Rolling Stone bars past and present members of his staff from access to pens, paper, recording equipment, typewriters, word-processing software, chalk, slate, pointed sticks and \"large expanses of flat sand\" in an effort to stop them recording details of the singer's life which might bring a future member of the House of Lords into disrepute. Jagger's lawyers argued that a \"presumption of confidentiality\" is inherent in any employment contract with Mr Jagger because his behaviour is so consistently reprehensible. Lady (Heather) McCartney A last-minute gagging order issued by a Los Angeles judge prohibits the broadcast of footage of Lady McCartney throwing rocks at a squirrel. She and her husband Sir Paul, both committed vegetarians, have repeatedly claimed that the footage - which dates from 1998 - is misleading, and that the \"rocks\" were actually large Brazil nuts. Columbia Pictures Norwich Crown Court has upheld a ban on behalf of the motion picture company, which prevents a group of East Anglian eight-year-olds from publishing details of the terrible nightmares they had after seeing Spider Man. The judge said such nightmares were in clear breach of copyright. Princess Michael of Kent Marie-Christine, Princess Michael of Kent has been granted an injunction banning the publication of embarrassing financial details regarding her living arrangements, on the grounds that she is better than everyone else. Tony Blair The Prime Minister will seek to bar Sir Michael Willcocks, the current Black Rod, from publishing a memo in which he alleges that Mr Blair's appearance at the Queen Mother's funeral was delayed by a fit of giggles. Lawyers for the Prime Minister insist that two separate events have been conflated, and that Mr Blair was in fact laughing at the name Willcocks. Overturned this week A Californian judge has temporarily lifted a ban preventing Mr Stephen Bing from issuing further sperm, on the grounds that Mr Bing has a big weekend in Vegas coming up. A class-action \"super-injunction\" on behalf of Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lopez, Victoria Beckham, Julia Roberts, Michael Jackson, et al, against everyone they have ever met, will be suspended pending a European court ruling on whether or not celebrities have souls. Campaigners for \"Naomi's law\" are considering an appeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
