On the other side of the fence, beneath the plane trees, the people of Hortaleza go about their business, pushing buggies, walking dogs and casting the occasional glance at the reception centre for menas, or unaccompanied foreign minors. If the centre has long been infamous locally, it acquired national notoriety last week when Abascal, leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, singled it out in a TV debate before Sunday\u2019s general election. \u201cI live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood \u2013 Hortaleza,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every time I\u2019m on the street \u2013 and there\u2019s a menas centre there \u2013 I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.\u201d Neither Vox\u2019s messaging nor its targets have been hard to make out in the last days of the campaign. In Monday\u2019s debate, Abascal falsely suggested that 70% of gang rapes in Spain were committed by foreigners. Earlier the same day, Roc\u00edo Monasterio, Vox\u2019s leader in Madrid, descended on the gates of another centre for unaccompanied minors, in Seville, arguing that menas made the streets unsafe and posed \u201ca serious problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d. Monasterio\u2019s husband, Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, a Vox spokesman, joined in the following day, claiming that foreigners were three times more likely to commit rape than Spaniards. If polls are to be believed, the party\u2019s strategy \u2013 less dog whistle and more canine klaxon \u2013 seems to be paying off. Vox\u2019s defence of what it sees as traditional Spanish values, bolstered by its uncompromising stance on Catalan independence, puts it in a position to finish third in Spain\u2019s fourth general election in as many years. Not bad for a party that won its first seats in congress less than seven months ago. Even more notable has been its effect on its rightwing rivals, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party. Both shifted further right before April\u2019s election, hoping to compete with Vox, and both have enlisted the support of Abascal\u2019s grouping to win power in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. The new triple-right \u2013 unaffectionately known by some as the trifachito (facha being slang for fascist) \u2013 has filled the political space that used to be the sole territory of the PP. A recent cover of the satirical magazine El Jueves showed Vox, the PP and Citizens emerging from General Franco\u2019s grave in the Valley of the Fallen, with the PP leader Pablo Casado crying: \u201cHa ha! We are the true remains of Franco!\u201d Abascal appeared to acknowledge the party\u2019s inspiration during the debate, when he paraphrased the fascist philosopher Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, saying: \u201cOnly the rich can permit themselves the luxury of not having a homeland.\u201d The party went on to address the question of homelands within Spain on Thursday. In a symbolic proposal backed by Citizens and the PP in Madrid\u2019s regional parliament, Vox called for a ban \u201cof separatist parties that threaten the unity of Spain\u201d. Vox also has a blacklist of media outlets it views as critical and bans them from its offices and events. They include the newspaper El Pa\u00eds, radio network Cadena Ser and the online newspaper Eldiario.es. The acting prime minister and socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, was not slow to acknowledge the parallels with the past. \u201cFixing on homosexuals, blaming women for gender-based violence, suggesting a ban on political parties \u2013 all that has a name that doesn\u2019t need to be spelt out,\u201d he said. Like most rightwing populist parties, Vox delights in provoking outrage by spewing provocative messages regardless of their veracity. But for many, the attacks on unaccompanied migrant children are repellent at best and dangerous at worst. Emilio Delgado, a member of the Madrid regional parliament for the leftwing M\u00e1s Madrid party, points out that the Hortaleza centre is desperately overcrowded and under-resourced. \u201cThe kids there are fighting over who gets a mattress so they don\u2019t have to sleep on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s happening in a public facility run by the richest regional government in Spain. There are 70 or 80 or 100 kids there when there should only be 30 or 40. That obviously brews conflict between the kids themselves and for staff and neighbours.\u201d The centre\u2019s residents have also been attacked twice in a fortnight by people armed with oars and clubs. Delgado acknowledges that some of the young people cause problems in the neighbourhood but said he was disgusted by Abascal\u2019s words. \u201cI get along fine with politicians with whom I disagree on a lot of things, but it\u2019s really hard to do that with Vox when they\u2019re painting targets on the chests of very vulnerable boys and girls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re crossing all the red lines, and the PP and Citizens are along for the ride.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arag\u00f3n, who has been working with homeless young people in Hortaleza for 30 years as part of the Olivar association, also admits there is a problem. Four years ago, his mother had a necklace torn from her throat in the area. But he argues that the current thefts and robberies are nothing compared with the \u201cheroin years\u201d of the 1970s and 1980s when drug disputes in Hortaleza were settled with knives and pistols. \u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been going on for quite a few years,\u201d he said. With the centre overwhelmed, some young people had taken to sleeping on the streets to avoid the conflicts and overcrowding, while others escaped by sniffing glue. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of care: lots of these kids are cold and hungry and have been on the streets for hours.\u201d After the economic crisis, and with the rise of Vox, Arag\u00f3n said, old xenophobic narratives had begun to resurface. And some agendas, he added, were better served by demonising people and focusing on problems rather than accepting responsibility.\u201cThere are people in this neighbourhood who are helping, by giving boxing lessons and organising football matches,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people doing all that but other people are interested in telling a different story. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is adolescent kids who are bored, alone and have no future. That normally means things are going to happen. It would be odd if they didn\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
