New Oak primary, in Hengrove, Bristol, will be replaced by an academy for 1,200 pupils aged three to 18. Bristol city council said the proposals for the new school came to light only after the \"last touches of paint\" were put on the refit. The school was finally opened in September - just after the DfES put forward the idea of an \"all through\" academy. The council admits the circumstances are \"embarrassing\". \"We accept it's been a waste of money, but it's too good an opportunity to pass up.\" \u00b7 And talking of academies, it's nearly the end of the road for Islington Green school, famously rejected by the Blairs. Or is it? On Thursday, the local schools organisation committee will meet to consider the council's application to close the school, to allow it to reopen as an academy. But local campaigners against the new academy are buoyed by last week's school league tables in which the school scored well on \"value-added\" measures. Lawyers for the National Union of Teachers are sharpening their quill pens and, if a closure notice is approved, are planning to seek a judicial review on the grounds of insufficient consultation. \u00b7 David Hirsh, a sociology lecturer at Goldsmiths College, who runs a website dedicated to opposing the campaign for an academic boycott of Israel, has identified the main issue in the election for general secretary of the University and College Union: the crimes of Joseph Stalin. Hirsh devotes half an article to this subject, because Roger Kline's father was a Jewish communist in the 1950s. He mentions that Kline himself was a member of the Socialist Workers' party, but omits to point out that his break with this organisation occurred 32 years ago. Both main candidates oppose a boycott, but while Hirsh supplies a link to Sally Hunt's full statement about it, when it comes to Kline, he offers only a link to a Socialist Workers article supporting him. Elections can turn dirty, but this one is positively glutinous. \u00b7 Exciting new methods from the Centre for Excellence in Leadership. Last week, \"college principals and governors took part in an innovative leadership learning event\". The CEL helpfully provides a description of its exciting new teaching methods: \"The session was chaired by Dr Ann Limb, and the minister for lifelong learning, further and higher education, Bill Rammell MP, answered e-learning and technology questions submitted by delegates.\" Like all the greatest innovative ideas, you're left wondering why no one's thought of it before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
