Although the England midfielder handed the ball to Germany's captain to seal the 2-0 win over Werder Bremen on Tuesday, the decision was dictated by the circumstances of the game. \"I did miss three days earlier [against Charlton] so I think it was the ideal moment for Michael to take one and get his first goal for Chelsea,\" said Lampard. \"He finished it very well - it's not about who takes the penalties, it's who scores them.\" Lampard has missed three of his last four spot-kicks but stressed he would continue to take them. \"Yes, I will take more penalties for Chelsea,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
