You might have noticed the increased sunshine and warmer temperatures having less of a positive impact on your health or mindset than they have in past summers. Or you might have taken ages to get over an illness from early in the year. Or you might be running yourself ragged with too many work and social commitments. You may also have noticed yourself getting burned out around this time every year and have theories as to why. You may even have taken steps to mitigate it. Either way, we\u2019d be interested to hear your experiences and views of \u201cmid-year burnout\u201d. Share your experiences Does the idea of mid-year burnout resonate with you? If so, does this happen to you every year, or just this year? And what do you think is driving it?
