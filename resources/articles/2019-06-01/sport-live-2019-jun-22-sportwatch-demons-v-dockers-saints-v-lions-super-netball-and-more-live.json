Please feel free to return for more tomorrow when there\u2019ll be news on the Matildas\u2019 World Cup run, Ash Barty\u2019s quest for number one, and all the latest from the Cricket World Cup. TTFN. These sides could have ended the round level on points but there was a gulf in class over the four quarters at Marvel Stadium with Brisbane storming to a 56-point victory. It was just the tonic for the Lions after slipping up against Carlton before their bye week, the four points cementing their status as likely finalists for the first time since 2009. Charlie Cameron finished with five goals, headlining a ruthless team performance featuring a nine-goal third quarter. Today\u2019s Sportwatch is going to wind down once the Lions finish mauling the Saints, but if you still want to keep up with the live sport going on around the world you can begin by tuning into the India v Afghanistan Cricket World Cup liveblog. Later on you\u2019ll also be able to find OBO coverage of NZ v WI and for early risers (5am kick off) there\u2019s plenty on offer around The Matildas when they take on Norway in the last 16 of the Women\u2019s World Cup tomorrow. Indeed! Amazing what a week off can do to a side. On that subject, it will be fascinating to see if Geelong continue their horrible post-bye form against Port Adelaide later. But back to the Lions, considering how poor they were on and off field for so long Chris Fagan deserves enormous credit for their performances this season and a likely first final since 2009. Super Rugby: 57 mins: Hurricanes 32-21 Bulls - The Hurricanes are making home advantage count in their Super Rugby quarter-final against the Bulls. They\u2019re on course for a blockbuster semi-final away to the Crusaders. AFL: 3QT: St Kilda 5.7 (37) v 16.11 (107) Brisbane - Marvel Stadium is an unprepossessing place to be at the best of times but on a bleak midwinter night such as this it is the last place you want to be, especially as a St Kilda fan watching your team sliced and diced by a pack of rampaging Lions. Brisbane just turned in their best quarter in a decade (statistically), belting 9.3 past the hapless Saints. Charlie Cameron was unstoppable on the ground, Oscar McInerney and Eric Hipwood unbeatable in the air, and Chris Fagan\u2019s unlikely mob are blossoming into this season\u2019s good news story. Rugby League: Barely 24 hours after a severe allergic reaction reportedly left him close to death, Queensland\u2019s Moses Mybe has been remarkably cleared to play Sunday\u2019s State of Origin II in Perth. It has been revealed that Maroons team doctor Matt Hislop rushed to Mbye\u2019s aid after receiving a phone call for help on Friday morning, only to find the utility slumped outside his Perth hotel room. News Corp Australia said Moses, 25, went into anaphylactic shock and only had minutes to live after his airways closed by the time Hislop discovered the Wests Tigers captain. Staying on the same hotel floor, Hislop raced to Mbye\u2019s room with a first aid kit and used an anti-allergy injection EpiPen device to revive him. \u201cMoses developed a serious allergic reaction and he was worried enough to call me straight away,\u201d Hislop said in a QRL statement. \u201cBy the time I was able to see him, he was beginning to show signs of the reaction with a skin rash and swelling. \u201cI started treatment immediately and he responded quickly.\u201d Mbye completed the Maroons\u2019 captain\u2019s run at Optus Stadium on Saturday, giving no indication of the drama that had unfolded 24 hours earlier. \u201cIt was something that came on unexpectedly. I have never experienced anything like that before,\u201d Mbye said. \u201cIt was obviously a reaction to something. I started feeling a bit itchy and lightheaded. \u201cI phoned the doc and he managed it professionally. We had all our supplies here ready to go and we got on top of it early. I\u2019m feeling sweet now and ready to play.\u201d From AAP. AFL: Q3, 15.00 mins remaining: St Kilda 4.7 (31) v 10.9 (69) Brisbane - After coming through that opening quarter arm-wrestle the Lions are now bullying the Saints off the ground at Marvel Stadium. The visitors have kicked the last six goals to extend their lead beyond 30 points. Charlie Cameron is the dominant figure on the ground despite just eight touches, one mark and one tackle to his name. The reason being five of those eight disposals have been goals. Rugby League: I\u2019m going to be honest, I don\u2019t really have much of a handle on how international rugby league operates, but New Zealand have just beaten Tonga 34-14 in the opening match of the Oceania Cup. Shaun Johnson crossed for a hat-trick but it was Brandon Smith who took most of the plaudits for his performance out of dummy half. AFL: HT: St Kilda 4.6 (30) v 7.8 (50) Brisbane - The Lions extended their lead over the Saints during a scrappy second quarter at Marvel Stadium. If they see out the contest Brisbane will move up to sixth on the ladder. And if Geelong defeat Port Adelaide later on they\u2019ll enjoy a two-game buffer in the race for the finals and on course for their first September action in a decade. Golf: West Australian Hannah Green holds a three shot lead at the halfway mark of the Women\u2019s PGA Championship at Hazeltine. The 22-year old only secured her LPGA Tour card last year but is now in pole position to secure one of the biggest prizes in golf. Super Rugby: The Super Rugby semi-finals will be hosted in Christchurch and Buenos Aires after the Crusaders and Jaguares won their respective quarter-finals. The Hurricanes and Bulls play off later in Wellington for the right to take on the nine-time champions with the Brumbies welcoming the Sharks to Canberra with a trip to South America on the line. AFL: QT: St Kilda 3.3 (21) v 4.6 (30) Brisbane - The Lions will be savouring their isotonic sports drinks the most at quarter time as they enjoy a slender lead over the Saints at Marvel Stadium. Charlie Cameron has been the star of the show, booting three goals while Dan Hannebery has made a positive start to life as a Saint with 11 disposals. AFL: Positive news filtering through from the MCG with Ross Lyon indicating Jesse Hogan\u2019s injury isn\u2019t as bad as first thought, dismissing suggestions it\u2019s a recurrence of the navicular problem. The Sunshine Coast Lightning have kept alive their chances of claiming the minor premiership with a 65-57 Super Netball win against the West Coast Fever. Victory by the two-time defending champions has kept the NSW Swifts within reach and delivers a crippling blow to the sixth-placed Fever\u2019s finals hopes. Shooting pair Peace Proscovia (44 goals) and Steph Wood (21) were dominant but the home side had winners everywhere. Wing attack Laura Scherian, one of the shortest players on the court, towered over her rivals as she weaved through the Fever defence on her way to a game-high 43 feeds. Every time the Lightning threatened to race away with the contest, the visitors found a way to claw back. Sunshine Coast led by up to four goals during the first half but greater involvement from Fever goaler Kaylia Stanton kept her side in touch. The Lightning\u2019s patience was rewarded when they took charge in the third quarter. New Zealand international Laura Langman flashed into prominence with three intercepts for the quarter. Her exuberance spread throughout the Lightning camp, with defensive duo Phumza Maweni and Karla Pretorius poaching a combined three gains between them to help break open what had been a tight contest. From AAP. State of Origin: The showpiece of Australian rugby league heads to Optus Stadium in Perth tomorrow and all eyes will be on a much-changed (navy) Blues side bidding to keep the series alive. Fittler has made seven changes to an Origin team that lost Game 1 by four points, including dropping the centre who a month ago was regarded as the best player in the world. Fittler has picked fullbacks in the centres. He has picked a seven who\u2019ll play second-fiddle to the six. He has picked a tyro in the front-row and four back-rowers on the bench. Super Netball: 3QT: Lightning 51-42 Fever - The Lightning have been threatening to burst clear all game and they finally put some daylight between themselves and the Fever in the third quarter. Peace Proscovia and Steph Wood have missed just three shots between them so far. The Demons have snapped a four game losing streak to outlast a depleted Dockers at the MCG. Despite Fremantle leading for most of the opening three quarters injuries eventually took their toll with Melbourne running over the top in the final term. The most serious of those Fremantle injuries was suffered by Jesse Hogan, the star recruit in tears on the interchange bench with what looks to be a recurrence of his troublesome navicular problem. For Melbourne there was a return to form for Tom McDonald who kicked 3.2 in a 28-disposal performance while Max Gawn dominated in the ruck. Despite the victory Melbourne remain in 16th on the ladder and unlikely to feature in the finals. Fremantle stay sixth and in the running for September action but there\u2019s just one game separating them and St Kilda as far down as 12th. Tennis: I know we\u2019re deep into footy season and there are a couple of world cups to train our attention on but the story of Ash Barty may already be the sporting highlight of 2019. A recent grand slam winner the 23-year old is now two wins away from ascending to the world number one ranking. She is a star. AFL: 7.00 remaining: Melbourne 12.7 (79) v 11.5 (71) Fremantle - After trailing for most of the match Melbourne have hit the front courtesy of a timely return to form from Tom McDonald. Super Netball: HT: Lightning 33-31 Fever - The Lightning collected their second bonus point of the match to take a two-point lead into the half-time break. Sunshine Coast threatened to run away with the contest in that second quarter before West Coast pegged them back, only to see Peace Proscovia goal right on the siren. State of Origin: A crowd of 10,515 at North Sydney Oval celebrated another New South Wales victory in Women\u2019s State of Origin, the fourth in a row for the Blues. As Larissa O\u2019Connor writes, yesterday\u2019s contest typifies the continued growth of women\u2019s sport. In days gone by, sceptics of women\u2019s sport were fixated on an imbalance of physical strength but over time, many are recognising this genre\u2019s aura of excitement, wholesomeness and determination which resonate widely. It\u2019s a recipe which has seen audiences grow in key sectors such as netball, AFL and more recently, league. It\u2019s now not a case of whether the women should play a curtain raiser during the year, but where next year\u2019s Origin will be held seeing North Sydney Oval could barely hold last night\u2019s crowd and once again, food supplies were exhausted in the first half. AFL: 3QT: Melbourne 9.6 (60) v 10.5 (65) Fremantle - Speaking of The G there\u2019s all to play for still in the first AFL fixture of the day. The Dockers have led for most of the afternoon but with the margin less than a goal the Demons are not out of the picture. Brandon Matera kicked Fremantle ahead on three-quarter time, one of three goals he\u2019s bagged so far in a superb all-round performance. This remains a live topic of debate, but it also invites a cheap gag about the attendance at a Demons vs Docker fixture at the MCG... Super Netball: QT: Lightning 17-16 Fever - There\u2019s just a goal in it at quarter-time with Sunshine Coast poking their noses in front of West Coast. Lightning, second on the ladder, haven\u2019t had things all their own way in the early exchanges but the Fever\u2019s Kaylia Stanton is only shooting at 50% from six attempts. AFL: Sticking with footy, Tom Haskell has addressed the poorly disguised elephant in the room when the AFL is dishing out punishments for gambling indiscretions. With the news of Collingwood forward Jaidyn Stephenson\u2019s 10-game suspension for placing three same game multi-bets totalling $36 in three separate matches in which he played, there is a certain irony to the Rising Star winner being punished so harshly for participating in something that has become so widespread with the help of the AFL. It is difficult to have sympathy for the AFL in this regard, but for Stephenson, as a young man who fits the targeted audience, a degree of empathy ought to be granted. AFL: Paul Daley has filed a typically thought-provoking column on the latest chapter in the contested debate over the origins of Australian rules football. Like the land, so much Indigenous and shared black/white history has been colonised. White fellas didn\u2019t always admit in writing (though plenty did!) to killing the Indigenes whose families had lived forever on the land they stole. Would Wills have volunteered any Indigenous influence on the game he pioneered for the Melbourne Cricket Club, whose first match was played in Melbourne between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar? Cricket World Cup 2019: New life was breathed into the interminable group phase of the Cricket World Cup with Sri Lanka upsetting England in a low-scoring thriller overnight. Lasith Malinga was once again the destroyer-in-chief and his intervention has made life awkward for the hosts and tournament favourites who have three matches remaining, all against likely semi-finalists, and they\u2019ll need to win at least one to guarantee their progression. In the warm-ups here Malinga had strolled up, arm wanging out behind him and knocked down a single rubber stump four times in a row on the half-volley. As England chased he bowled 82mph in his jumper and picked up a pair of edges and a pair of classic full-slinger lbws. James Vince, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Jos Buttler were the flower of England\u2019s batting ripped out, all deceived by that masterly, dipping, veering command of length and line. Malinga remains a sui generis modern great, the boy from the palm scrub who swam in the sea to build his strength, who came to the city as a country nobody; who is still basically bowling a tennis ball on the beach; but who did for the most heavily resourced team in ODI history here. Rugby: The absurdity of this story makes me resent having to give it exposure, but it is sporting news and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to discuss, so here\u2019s the latest on a wealthy young man with a multimillion dollar property empire hawking for cash. As you can imagine, the entreaties of a recent Lamborghini owner alongside those of the gravely ill did not meet with universal praise. Women\u2019s World Cup 2019: In the early hours of tomorrow morning the knockout phase of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup gets underway with Germany taking on Nigeria at 1.30am and Australia facing Norway at 5am. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster tournament for The Matildas so far and there remain plenty of unknowns as they prepare for the round of 16. Richard Parkin is all over the ifs and buts on the French Riviera. Nice work if you can get it. The temptation in tournament football is always to keep one eye upon the pathway ahead. With a potential quarter-final showdown with England, and a possible semi-final clash with either of the two tournament favourites France or the USA, those are exactly the kind of fixtures that a Matildas side bristling to prove themselves would relish. Which is why this Norway fixture is so tricky. With talk of \u201cgoing one better\u201d after three consecutive quarter-finals appearances, the players cannot afford to have one eye on anything other than the match in Nice. AFL: HT: Melbourne 5.4 (34) v 6.4 (40) Fremantle - There\u2019s just a kick in it at half-time between Melbourne and Fremantle in an absorbing contest at the MCG. All the build-up to this one was about Demon turned Docker Jesse Hogan and the aftermath will be as well with the key forward failing to see out the half after suffering an injury to his troublesome right foot. It is feared it could be a recurrence of the navicular problem that has previously ruled Hogan out for long spells. Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Saturday Sportwatch. On the agenda today we have live Super Netball and AFL, along with a feast of results and news from around the sporting world. We\u2019ll begin by checking in on the AFL fixture between the Demons and Dockers that got underway at 1.45pm, before turning our attention to the Saints and Lions from 4.35pm. There\u2019s only one Super Netball outing this afternoon to keep an eye on in the final round before the World Cup break takes effect. That begins at 3pm and sees the Fever travelling to the Lightning. If that wasn\u2019t enough there\u2019s the men\u2019s cricket and women\u2019s football world cups to catch up on, a rep weekend of rugby league, and the little matter of Ash Barty possibly just a few hours away from the world number one ranking.
