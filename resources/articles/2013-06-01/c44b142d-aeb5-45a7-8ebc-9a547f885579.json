The findings, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, are based on a systematic review of 20 previous studies of the relationship between pre- and postnatal exposure to antibiotics and later risk of eczema. The authors from London, Nottingham and Aberdeen concluded that: \"Overall, we found a significant positive association between postnatal antibiotic prescribing and later risk of the skin condition. There was also a 7% increase in eczema risk with each additional course of antibiotics during the first year of life.\" But the authors also say that the use of antibiotics could be a result of the treatment of higher than usual rates of infections among children with eczema. At least one in five children suffers from eczema, although most grow out of it, according to the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD), which represents specialists in skin conditions. Dr Carsten Flohr, a co-author, said: \"A better understanding of the complex relationship between antibiotic use and allergic disease is a priority for clinicians and health policymakers alike, as determination of a true link between antibiotic use and eczema would have far-reaching clinical and public health implications.\" Nina Goad, spokeswoman for BAD, said: \"The researchers are not suggesting that parents should withhold antibiotics from children when doctors feel such treatment is necessary, but studies like this give an insight into possible avoidable causes and may help to guide medical practice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
