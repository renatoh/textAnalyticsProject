He appears to be reinventing himself as a mixture of talent scout and guide to newcomers entering the top flight. It may be prudent for Capello to present himself as a nurturer of future stars. The bookies make England fourth favourites for the European Championship and nothing that occurred at Wembley will provoke a rethink. The defeat of the world and European champions was still to be enjoyed on its own terms. Self-sacrificing qualities of diligence and discipline were at the heart of the victory. There was also a reason to wonder if there has ever been a truly great team that is so quirky in the way it expresses its superiority. At the 2010 World Cup Spain won all their matches in the knockout stages, including the final, by a 1-0 margin. The technique in the passing generally leaves opponents demoralised and weary but the consequences can be surprising on occasions when their focus is less severe. Since the autumn of last year their record in friendlies has included defeats by Argentina and Portugal by 4-1 and 4-0 margins respectively. Though Spain were short of their peak on Saturday, the sloppiness was not so marked and the sense of occasion generated by the 87,189 crowd had its effect on both sides. England were compelled to maintain concentration because Spain did react to falling behind, with David Villa hitting the post and the substitute Cesc F\u00e1bregas shooting wide when he ought to have scored. Incidents of that type were always likely to be needed if the hosts were to make off with a win. So far as the rest of the action was concerned, Capello barely thought of anything other than halting the opposition. The stereotypes of catenaccio do not fit him well and his Milan side, when hampered by injury and suspension, still beat Barcelona 4-0 in the 1994 Champions League final. Adopting an open style against Spain would have been delusional. Capello's team at Wembley was barely equipped to attack at all and it made sense that the goal should come from a set piece. Darren Bent got free of Sergio Ramos to connect with a James Milner free-kick in the 49th minute and the header that came off the post was helped over the line by Frank Lampard. It was an oddity of a fixture, with the crowd arriving in great humility and suppressing the little hope that they could not get rid of entirely. Spain are in no need of compliments but it was still a tribute to them that England's prolonged defending did not rankle with the fans. They had anticipated nothing else. Despite that, there were quiet and even contemplative moments when the crowd must have been preoccupied with the thought that superior footballers were bound to make a breakthrough for Spain. The manager lauded Scott Parker as \"a point of reference\" in his job as holding midfielder and there was composure in central defence. Capello tends to speak as if it were always on his agenda to take a closer look at, say, Phil Jagielka but the Everton player has at best been of secondary interest to the manager until now. It seems, too, that Joleon Lescott, the other centre-half against Spain, is getting better at a fairly late stage in his career. The test of pursuing the Premier League title and Champions League at Manchester City must be stimulating. John Terry will come back into the lineup against Sweden but it will be healthy for the national team if he and Rio Ferdinand, should the Manchester United captain be able to stay fit, come to understand that there are rivals who could replace them permanently. There is no golden generation in sight but Capello does have scope to refresh the squad in part. In the England ranks there were some young men whose value is still being assessed by onlookers, whether in the technical area or the stands. \"It was an important night for England,\" Capello said. \"I remember, as a manager, there were a lot of times when I put young players, [Roma's Daniele] De Rossi and others, into my team and you could see if a player has the confidence. That is what is so important.\" Capello applauded Phil Jones's movement and tackling, even as he recognised the player had found the going hard at Wembley. The manager appreciates, all the same, that taking on a superior side is simple in some psychological aspects since expectations are low for whoever clashes with Spain. England had been instructed to drop deep and defend in numbers because Capello knew that an attempt to press high up the pitch would not have stopped slick Spain from getting into the gaps left in front of the back four. The approach and personnel will alter for Tuesday and the Wembley crowd will look for the type of entertainment that had been forbidden at the weekend, but that hard-earned victory against Spain was relished in its own fashion.
