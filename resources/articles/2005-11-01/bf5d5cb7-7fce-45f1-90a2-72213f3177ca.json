We're really busy with last the few weeks of Richard II and getting ready for Aladdin. So we're going from dealing with major Shakespeare fans to stressed-out parents with kids. Though we do get quite a mix for this Aladdin - from hardcore Ian McKellan fans to people with no kids who just want a laugh and, of course, the families. Where would you rather be? Arizona. I'm a big John Ford fan and love the idea of that expanse of wilderness and amazing beauty. What's so special about it? The beauty of it all and the fact that you would probably not meet your standard tourist there. In fact you probably wouldn't meet anyone at all. What would you do there? Just be at one with nature and observe. I'd love to see the night sky there - with no light pollution. Where would you stay? Nowhere. I'd sleep outside under the stars with a little fire to keep the coyotes at bay. Who would you go with? I'd take my husband and the kids, but dump them in Vegas and go into the desert with a proper old cowboy. What's the one place you want to see before you die? Petra. I'd like to arrive on a camel at sunrise. \u00b7 Aladdin runs from Dec 7-Jan 22 at the Old Vic (0870 0606628, oldvictheatre.com)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
