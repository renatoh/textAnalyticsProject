Shirley, you'll remember, went to a mass-market Greek island and had to cope with hordes of ignorant fellow Brits turning up their noses at Greek food and culture. It was hardly getting away from it all, and had she gone this year, with all eyes on Olympic Athens, she might have been particularly hard-pressed to find that isolated spot of beach for Costas to set up her table. There are however, 2,000 Greek islands, and my advice, especially in Olympic year, is to pick one you've never heard of. We'd done exactly that, and hence found ourselves on Halki, a speck in the south Dodecanese, the most southerly of the Greek islands, reached via a 75-minute boat ride from Rhodes. So, while a few miles away at Faliraki on Rhodes, tourist hordes were living it up in the bars and nightclubs, we on Halki - a blissful one-horse (well, one-taxi) island - were enjoying the most peaceful, idyllic holiday ever. Only two bare, rocky miles across and seven miles long, Halki supports just one harbour fishing village, Emborio, which comprises 300 distinctive houses clustered in tiers around a charming, almost totally enclosed bay. Our villa was on the waterfront, yards - and I really mean yards - from bed to exhilarating clear, turquoise Aegean. The couple in the villa next door had been coming for 17 years (newcomers compared with some of the regulars here!) and quickly filled us in on the laid back Anglo-Greek lifestyle. 'Fortnum &amp; Mason' was the nickname for the tiny grocery store 100 yards away, just past the Byzantine church tower, that would sell us Greek yoghurt, olives, ouzo and retsina. Ferocious Fanni would come and clean for us. She likes to scowl, curse and throw shoes around, so be careful, they told us. Already we felt at home. Except that, at home, there's always something to be done. Not here. 'Choice' can be an overrated commodity when it comes to holidays. Most of us get plenty of it back home - so many urgent alternatives, so much rushing around and feeling you're missing something. The beauty of Halki is that there is no choice. Day one went like this: wake, watch spectacular sunrise over Rhodes, dive from terrace into sea, breakfast, read, swim again, kalamari for lunch at one of the five tavernas on the harbour front, read, swim again, siesta, and catch-of-the-day in another taverna before watching the spectacular sunset. And days two to five went pretty much the same. Here you get to read plenty... and write, too, if you want to. Writer Lynne Truss was there at the same time as us, finishing off in a nearby villa what would soon become the runaway bestseller Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves . While she laboured over commas and colons we tried out one of the few choices available on the island, setting off in blazing sunshine for the crumbling 14th century Crusader castle, an hour's hard walk and some very dodgy climbing over loose boulders, repaid by stunning views and the castle all to ourselves. Another day we took a boat trip round the island, and on another Dimitri the baker let a few of us pile into his truck and took us to the island's monastery for an impromptu lunch with the keeper. As crucial as the setting to our enjoyment of the holiday was the tour operator we went with. Greek island specialist Laskarina, a small, independent company from Derbyshire, is not about five-star luxury and unlimited fluffy towels. It's about an honest, plain-speaking, brochure, unbeatable local knowledge, the best properties on the islands and mature, experienced, charismatic reps. Halki rep Bob will give you a copy of his star chart so you can identify the constellations while lazing on your terrace after dark. Or he'll cajole you into the water for the famous Laskarina synchronised swim. Or he'll tell you anecdotes about the Greek donkeys and the KY jelly or the Laskarina client-turned-streaker who had to be handcuffed and shipped off to Rhodes. He may even have you round for chips'n'eggs'n' Shirley Valentine if he likes you. Idyllic as Halki is, why do one Greek island when you can do two? Halki is normally twinned with nearby Symi or Tilos, all reached via Rhodes airport, but we wanted to see the north Dodecanese islands as well, so took the boat back to Rhodes, stayed overnight, then took the fast catamaran north in the morning. Four hours later it delivered us, and some goats, to Leros - another island many have never heard of, its main claim to fame being that it's the site of a mental hospital, a factor which has doubtless put off many tourists over the years. They don't know what they're missing. Leros, near Kos, lacks the intimacy of Halki but is bigger, greener and offers sumptuous and varied scenery - as depicted in numerous paintings featured in Laskarina's calendar by Jeremy, the excellent rep here. Soon we were installed in our holiday home, a charming converted windmill, and drinking in a fabulous view of the village of Pandeli below us and the Turkish coast in the distance. Leros has 9,000 inhabitants against Halki's 300, and there's far more to see. Laskarina had arranged hire of a couple of bicycles for us - an ideal way of exploring the fairly gentle hills, valleys and secluded coves of the island. The outline of Leros is so indented that there are 50 miles of coastline, which means it's easy to find a cove all to yourself. We cycled round spectacular Alinda Bay, took a swim on a deserted beach, then headed round the coast to the small port of Agia Marina, for an excellent lunch in a taverna. After a siesta it was back on the bikes and a short ride to the other side of the island to visit Lakki - an incongruous but fascinating Art Deco town, built in the Thirties by the Italians, one of numerous nationalities to have occupied the island in a rich history that dates back to 8000BC. Like some rundown mini-Miami, the broad tree-lined streets of Lakki occupy one of the largest natural harbours in the Mediterranean. That night it became clear that our windmill home was more than ornamental. The weather so far had been perfect but by 9pm on our last evening gusts were tearing into our sail, which was whizzing round at dizzying speed. Next morning, our neighbouring windmill had lost its sail completely. With boats now being cancelled all over the Aegean, would we ever get off the island? Jeremy the rep went through contingency plans A to F involving everything from big boats to Rhodes, to small boats to Kos, charter planes to Athens, and eventually, against all expectations, we made it by a succession of boats and cabs to Kos in time for the flight home. Impressive, certainly, but there was a part of me that wouldn't have minded being stranded in our Greek idyll for just a few days more.
