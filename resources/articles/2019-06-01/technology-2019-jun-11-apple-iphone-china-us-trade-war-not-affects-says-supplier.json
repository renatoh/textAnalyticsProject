Foxconn, one of Apple\u2019s largest suppliers, has moved to reassure consumers and investors that prices and supplies of the Apple\u2019s iPhone will not be affected by the ongoing US-China tariff war. According to a senior executive at Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, the company has more than enough capacity to make all iPhones bound for the US outside of China if necessary. \u201cTwenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we can help Apple respond to its needs in the US market,\u201d said Young Liu, Hon Hai\u2019s semiconductor division chief, at an investor briefing in Taipei. At the briefing \u2013 which was first reported by Bloomberg \u2013 Liu said the company was investing in India, where several older iPhone models are already made at a plant in Bangalore. \u201cWe have enough capacity to meet Apple\u2019s demand,\u201d Liu added. China is the source of most of Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads as well as its largest international market. Apple\u2019s production in China has become a major concern for investors as the Trump administration escalates threats to hit Beijing with new tariffs on about $300bn worth of Chinese goods. In his comments to investors, Liu said Apple had not given Hon Hai instructions to move production out of China. But he said the company is capable of moving production lines elsewhere according to customers\u2019 needs. Still, the vulnerability of tech assemblers and chip manufacturers to the trade war has already been established. Earlier this month, US semiconductor shares plummeted after the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei, the Chinese manufacturing giant accused of breaking sanctions on Iran and being a potential source of espionage for Beijing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
