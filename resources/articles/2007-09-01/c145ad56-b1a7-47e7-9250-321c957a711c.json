Welded to a love of breezy Britpop, the Harrow three-piece are the definition of easy listening, with soft drums, bass and piano fluttering around lovesick letters written to a girl gone awol. It's Not About You describes the circumstances in which she got up one morning and left for a year, Keep on Walking is just one of many pleas for her to return. Even I Need a Holiday, which neatly sums up the frustrations of the nine-to-fiver, eventually turns into another ode to \"the one\". The melodies and harmonies are almost indistinguishable, and the hidden track, a love song to pretty, inoffensive, endlessly enthusiastic but terminally bland kids TV presenter Michaela Strachan, sums up this debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
