In a major speech ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka this weekend where the US president, Donald Trump, will meet with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, Morrison has called on China to match its extraordinary economic power with \u201cadditional responsibilities\u201d, saying it has been a key beneficiary from the rules-based international trading system. \u201cUndoubtedly, the most significant change in most recent times has been the shift in the relationship between the United States and China, who exert the greatest influence on our region,\u201d Morrison will say on Wednesday. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship \u2013 the US-China relationship \u2013 is strained: trade tensions have escalated, the collateral damage is spreading, the global trading system is under real pressure.\u201d \u201cThe impact of any further deterioration of the relationship will not be limited to these two major powers.\u201d Saying that the \u201cshifted\u201d balance between the two superpowers required \u201curgent repair\u201d of the rules-based system, Morrison said China\u2019s prosperity had been achieved by having access to global trade, with the benefits not to be \u201cunderestimated\u201d. But since it had achieved its status as a global superpower, with China\u2019s international trade now worth $4tn, China had reached an \u201ceconomic maturity\u201d that required a change to how it dealt with its more developed trading partners. \u201cAs a rising global power, China also now has additional responsibilities. \u201cIt is therefore important that US-China trade tensions are resolved in the broader context of their special power responsibilities, in a way that is WTO-consistent and does not undermine the interests of other parties, including Australia.\u201d The prime minister will also say that there is no longer a level playing field between China and its trading partners, including the US. \u201cIt is now evident that the US believes that the rule-based trading system \u2013 in its current form \u2013 is not capable of dealing with China\u2019s economic structure and policy practices,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cMany of these concerns are legitimate \u2013 forced technology transfer is unfair, intellectual property theft cannot be justified, industrial subsidies are promoting overproduction.\u201d \u201cWhile we acknowledge that large parts of China are still to realise the prosperity of its major economic centres, it is also true that its most economically successful provinces, each of which is larger than most developed nations, including Australia, has reached and sometimes exceeded the economic sophistication of its global competitors. \u201cYet, at the same time, these economies get to compete with concessions, whether they be on trade, environmental obligations or other terms, not available to other developed economies. \u201cOur current trading system seems incapable of acknowledging, let alone resolving, these issues. \u201cThe rules-based system is in need of urgent repair if it is to adequately respond to these new challenges, including the rise of large emerging economies, changing patterns of trade and new technologies.\u201d Trade minister Simon Birmingham reinforced Morrison\u2019s message on Wednesday morning, telling the ABC the US and China both carried \u201cgreat power\u201d, which came with \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d. \u201cPlease end this dispute, to please recognise that the rules-based system for international trade has served us all incredibly well for decades, to commit to it, to modernise it and to work with us to make sure that we can all continue to use that as a platform for prosperity and growth in the future,\u201d he said. Morrison will also use the speech to outline how Australia will counter the rise of China in the Indo-Pacific region, highlighting its relationship with Japan, India, Indonesia and other Pacific nations. He also promotes Australia\u2019s alliance with the US, saying the relationship with the US \u201chas never been stronger\u201d. \u201cOurs is a resolute and mutually beneficial alliance partnership where neither party has the need to prove anything to each other,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cOur alliance with the US is the bedrock of Australia\u2019s security, providing us with irreplaceable hard power capabilities and intelligence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
