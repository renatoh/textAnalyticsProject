In its first quarterly earnings report since going public, Twitter revealed that it had more money than in the last three months of 2013 than analysts expected. But shares fell sharply as the company announced it had 241m users at the end of 2013, just 9m higher than the previous quarter. Twitter also disclosed that the number of \u201ctimeline views\u201d \u2013 its equivalent of page views, and a key measure for advertisers \u2013 dropped for the first time in the last quarter of 2013 to 148bn from 159bn. The fall came even as Twitter made a number or major changes, redesigning its mobile apps and websites and adding image and video previews to Tweets. The moves were designed to improve \u201cengagement\u201d \u2013 a key measure for advertisers who want to see their content favourited, retweeted and commented upon. According to the earnings report issued on Wednesday, in the three months to 31 December, the company had revenues of $242.7m, an increase of 116% compared to $112m in the same period last year. It made a net loss of $511m for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to a net loss of $9m in the same period last year. Twitter said it expected first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $230m to $240m, with revenue for the year of between $1.15bn and $1.2bn, nearly double the $665m it posted in 2013. \"Twitter finished a great year with our strongest financial quarter to date,\" said Dick Costolo, Twitter's CEO. \"We are the only platform that is public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed, and I'm excited by the number of initiatives we have underway to further build upon the Twitter experience.\" In a conference call with analysts Costolo was quizzed about its slowing user numbers. He said the company was \u201cdoubling down on accelerating growth in our core user base\u201d in 2014. Twitter has \u201cmassive global awareness\u201d he said but needed to make it easier for new people to \u201cget it\u201d. Costolo said changes to Twitter\u2019s products had already made significant differences, increasing the numbers of retweets and favourites. \u201cWe believe combined changes over the course of the year will start to change the slope of the user growth curve,\u201d he said. He said the company had a clear \u201croadmap\u201d for growing user numbers. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the early results,\u201d he said. Twitter went public last November and while its share price has soared, it has attracted some unusually negative coverage. Shares sold at $26 a share during the initial public offering and have traded as high as $74.73. They closed Wednesday at $66.21, before the earnings report was published. In after-hours trading, the stock fell by as much as 17%, Before the results were issued, 30% of the analysts following Twitter had posted sell ratings on the company\u2019s stock, while 27% listed it as buys and 43% were neutral, according to analyst FactSet. By comparison, 89% of analysts following Facebook are recommending a buy and none are posting sell ratings. Sell notes account for just 6% of all the analyst recommendations covering the S&amp;P 500 list of the top US companies. Analysts are concerned that Twitter\u2019s growth is slowing and that while Twitter\u2019s revenue is more than doubling each quarter, it has yet to make a profit. Shyam Patil, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said for many analysts the company\u2019s share price had risen \u201ctoo far too fast\u201d. Patil, who has a neutral rating on the company, said no new information had come out on the company before the quarterly results, and the share price had been driven up by expectations rather than facts. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good business. It is clearly differentiated from the competition,\u201d he said. He said Twitter had yet to figure out how it was going to make money, and that at the moment the sky-high valuation was based on bets that it would hit on a lucrative plan. \u201cYou could see an incredible house and think it\u2019s worth half a million only to find out it\u2019s being sold for $2m. It\u2019s still a great house,\u201d he said. Twitter is still growing quickly. The disappointing quarterly figures still represents a 30% rise year on year. But it accounts for a very small portion of the overall digital ad market. Twitter accounted for 0.5% of global digital ad revenues in 2013, according to eMarketer, up compared to 0.3% in 2012. Facebook, by comparison, accounts for 5.7% of global digital ad spending. Google accounts for 32.4%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
