Meanwhile, Bell Shakespeare\u2019s retiring founder, John Bell, will give audiences another take on Bizet\u2019s much-reproduced Carmen, but \u201cwith punch\u201d, we\u2019re told (it\u2019s surely been punchy before), and the Australian playwright and director Michael Gow will reimagine Bizet\u2019s much earlier opera, The Pearlfishers, contemplating the history behind its cultural stereotypes. All three productions should capably deliver the goods. But what of the new, large-scale, \u201cSydney-identified\u201d opera that Opera Australia\u2019s artistic director Lyndon Terracini hinted at several months ago as part of the company\u2019s 60th anniversary season in 2016? Unveiled on Tuesday, that would appear to be Sydney Opera House: The Opera, a new production and a new name for The Eighth Wonder, an opera by the Australian composer Alan John with a libretto by Dennis Watkins. But it\u2019s hardly new, having been staged inside the Opera House in 1995 then shelved for 20 years. For just five performances in October and November 2016, it will tell a story of political grandstanding, budget overruns, the sacking of architect J\u00f8rn Utzon and the narrowing of his vision for the Sydney landmark, despite its engineering magnificence and its postcard-perfect surface. A very Australian story of political expediency, then, and how appropriate it will be performed this time on the steps, showing off the Opera House\u2019s best bit: its sails. No risk of an audience contemplating the Joan Sutherland theatre\u2019s wings, which allow only a slither of space between a dancer pirouetting off stage and the wall, or those poor musicians cramped in the confines of the orchestra pit. There\u2019s one big reason why Neil Armfield\u2019s acclaimed take on Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle is returning to Melbourne, in November and December 2016, and not to Sydney: it wouldn\u2019t fit in the Opera House. The building\u2019s part closure in 2017 for maintenance will present a new set of problems for Opera Australia but could solve some old ones. Though as David McVicar told the Sydney Morning Herald this week: \u201cIt won\u2019t fix what should be fixed ... the orchestra pit is still a problem and back stage access is not ideal.\u201d It\u2019s still disappointing, however, that no other new work based on an Australian story will be presented either in Sydney or at the Arts Centre Melbourne in 2016. It was already a given that the much-lauded The Rabbits, based on John Marsden and artist Shaun Tan\u2019s picture book, would get a Sydney outing, as it will in January. The Rabbits sold 5,000 tickets at its Perth festival premiere, and is certain to be a drawcard at the Melbourne festival in October. Sadly, it\u2019s more than five years since Opera Australia presented a brand new work: Brett Dean\u2019s $2m Bliss, based on Peter Carey\u2019s novel, in 2010. But as Terracini told Guardian Australia in March, only 10,000 seats were sold across Bliss\u2019s Sydney and Melbourne seasons combined. Around the same time, Lindy Hume, the artistic director of Queensland Opera, insisted: \u201cIf it\u2019s an Australian creative team, it\u2019s an Australian work.\u201d That definition acknowledges, say, the antipodean flourish Bell and co will bring to Carmen, and Gow to The Pearlfishers. But are these our stories, reflecting and questioning our experiences back to us as Australians? Sydney Opera House: The Opera\u2019s theme of compromised vision may indeed reveal something flawed in the nation\u2019s uneasy relationship to culture. But its self-referential and literal landscape means it won\u2019t join the canon of Puccini, Verdi, Rossini and Bizet \u2013 endlessly reproduced. Why not bring back Voss, first staged in 1986 and based on the Patrick White novel, or help the State Opera of South Australia realise its plans to stage an opera of Tim Winton\u2019s Cloudstreet? The 2016 Opera on the Harbour will be Puccini\u2019s Turandot, directed by the Chinese artist Chen Shi-Zheng. Cue the Sydney flourish of fireworks, as per the Destination NSW brief: we give bang for our opera buck, even though those opera extravaganzas probably lose money for their undisclosed cost. Regrettably, the national opera review putting the artistic co-operation between the nation\u2019s big and small opera companies and the creation of new works under the microscope seems to have disappeared from sight. The review, which examined four opera companies in receipt of federal funds \u2013 Opera Australia, State Opera of South Australia, West Australian Opera and Opera Queensland \u2013 now looks unlikely to publish its report until the end of 2015, several months beyond its original projected deadline. It seems George Brandis\u2019s National Program for Excellence in the Arts is taking up all the government\u2019s creative thinking space right now. Which is somewhat less than excellent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
