The Coalition senator Eric Abetz refused to back his government\u2019s own energy policy during the program, saying it was \u201cpremature\u201d to say whether he supported the policy. The conservative Tasmania senator offered a lukewarm assessment of the national energy guarantee, saying Australia\u2019s attempts to reduce emissions would not make \u201cone scintilla of difference\u201d to climate change. On the same night that the government\u2019s backbench committee formally offered its support for the Neg to be debated in the Coalition party room, Abetz repeated his previous calls for a federal takeover of the AGL-owned Liddell power station. And while he stopped short of repeating Tony Abbott\u2019s threat to cross the floor to vote against it, Abetz stopped refused to back the Neg, describing it simply \u201ca framework\u201d. \u201cUntil such time as we have all the detail, I think it\u2019s premature to say you fully support it or fully oppose it,\u201d he said on Monday night. \u201cBut it seems to me that the driver behind the Neg is the Paris agreement, and India\u2019s not bound by it, China isn\u2019t nor is the US. \u201cIrrespective of your views [on] climate change \u2026 the simple fact is us doing our alleged bit in relation to Paris will not make one scintilla of difference to the world environment but it will make a huge difference to our economic wellbeing, to jobs and to standard of living in Australia.\u201d In an episode that lurched from energy policy to the soul of the United States and the limits or otherwise of free speech, Abetz found himself seated next to the philosopher and activist Cornel West. As well-known for his criticism of Barack Obama and the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates as for his civil rights activism, West, a Harvard professor visiting Australia as part of a debating tour, warned the US was experiencing a \u201cspiritual blackout\u201d and an \u201cescalation of corruption and criminality\u201d following Donald Trump\u2019s election as president. West labelled Trump a \u201cgangster\u201d and said his version of America was \u201ctriumphing\u201d while the one envisioned by Martin Luther King was \u201cwrestling with defeat\u201d. Warning that the US was in a state of \u201cdeep decay\u201d, he pointed to the increasing division between rich and poor, and rates of child poverty, as signs the country is in \u201cimperial meltdown\u201d. Challenged by Abetz \u2013 who pointed to falling unemployment in the US and said \u201cyour black brothers are getting jobs\u201d \u2013 West said he was talking about \u201cmoral and spiritual issues, not just the numbers\u201d. \u201cHitler and Mussolini had low unemployment rate [and] they made the trains run on time,\u201d he said. Monday\u2019s panel also included Canadian graduate student and teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd, who became a lightning rod for debates over free speech and academic freedom when she was reprimanded by her university for showing a talk by academic Jordan Peterson to one of her classes. Peterson is in part controversial for his refusal to agree to use gender-neutral pronouns to describe transgender people, and on Monday Shepherd said she considered herself a progressive but wanted \u201cto be able to question things like gender-neutral pronouns\u201d. Abetz labelled Shepherd\u2019s run-in with her university a case of \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d and said he did not believe the use of non-gendered language should be \u201cmandatory\u201d. The Labor senator Anne Aly, also on the panel, said she believed it was a \u201cmatter of respect\u201d to refer to someone the way they wanted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
