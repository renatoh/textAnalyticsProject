She set up a GCSE course in dance and, in her second year, all the fast-tracked students at the Bromley boys' comprehensive achieved A and B grades. Last month, 95 students from years 7 to 13 won the 2008 Rock Challenge UK southern final - it is thought to be the first boys' school in the UK to take the prestigious contemporary dance drama title - and Williams will introduce an AS level in dance in September. Not bad for a 29-year-old who is still in her first year as a qualified teacher. But Williams's drive and ambition are not unique in the south-east London school. Ravens Wood is a greenhouse school - one of a handful of places singled out by the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) as an example of a school that trains its own leaders. Headteachers are in short supply; many deputies shy away from applying for headships because of the onerous extra responsibility and workload. Academies, which operate outside the government pay scales, were last week accused of creaming off the best potential heads by offering salaries of more than \u00a3100,000. All schools have been urged to look at their succession planning as a shortage of leaders looms. Nearly 3,500 heads in England's 24,000 schools are expected to retire next year, compared with 2,250 in 2004. About three-quarters of secondary heads are aged over 50, with a quarter of all heads, including those in primary schools, over 55. At Ravens Wood, headteacher George Berwick believes his staff should be outstanding teachers but should also have the time and resources to develop their own ideas and demonstrate their ability to lead. Each year, Ravens Wood - rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2007 - carefully selects five graduates with leadership potential and runs school-centred initial teacher training. Berwick says: \"Initially, our focus in the first three years is on three things: getting the quality of their teaching up to the level of outstanding, getting their value added up to the standard of the school, and teaching them to lead.\" Leadership experience is generally given outside the teacher's subject area. Experience of working with others is strengthened by international projects and training, and project work with other schools. Staff turnover at the school is high. Of about 100 staff, between 15 and 20 will move on each year. \"That can be quite dangerous in terms of continuity, but it does give us an opportunity to feed into the system with new people at the bottom. So this keeps it a very young staff, a very dynamic staff,\" says Berwick. Mark Shepherd-Williams, head of year 8, is working his way through the Ravens Wood process. The 28-year-old joined the school six years ago and became a graduate trainee, then a newly qualified teacher (NQT). \"From my first day it was clear that people were given opportunities to lead in some form or another,\" he says. In his first year, Shepherd-Williams took responsibility for links with a Swedish university. He has taken charge of the gifted and talented programme, been deputy head of year, head of year, and mentors graduate entrants and NQTs. Now he has his sights on assistant headship. Talking to staff at Ravens Wood is a bit like being in the boardroom during the early stages of the BBC's The Apprentice. Everyone is resolutely bullish about their own prospects and the potential to grab the main prize - a headship - while there is less emphasis on pupil achievement, which is also rated as outstanding. But what happens when a member of staff fails to make the grade? Assistant head Kevin Saunders, 33, says: \"I have been knocked back once, but it is about taking it on the chin then readdressing that particular issue.\" He adds: \"My next step is deputy head. I have a career plan in my mind. I have always discussed that with Dr Berwick and he has supported me.\" Berwick says it is rare that serious problems are not spotted the first year at the school. \"We are very open in school about the quality of everyone's teaching and learning. All staff are required to work on the quality of their teaching at all times.\" He also recognises that some staff reach a level where further promotion is not open to them. Some decide to stay and others move on. \"If there are cases when a member of staff struggles, that is more likely to be down to personal circumstances or health issues, rather than being directly related to their ability to teach.\" Deputy head John Hernandez adds: \"We look after our staff and each other. Where support is needed, support is put in place.\" Hernandez arrived at Ravens Wood four years ago as an assistant head. Last year, he was appointed as one of four deputies at the 1,400-pupil school. \"I am ambitious,\" he says. \"I have aligned my personal ambitions with those of the school.\" Waiting in the wings The odds are that Hernandez, 34, will stroll into a headship - following the path of his six predecessors - and after years of developing succession strategies and 15 years at Ravens Wood, Berwick, 59, must be aware that there is a successor waiting in the wings. \"I would like to think so,\" he says. \"I have four deputies and would expect any one of them to be able to run for headship. I think it's very important that they have that ambition because they will want to be outstanding and want to leave their mark at the school, so the students will benefit.\" But one big drawback is that many of the school's proteges have only ever worked with an outstanding leadership team, in an outstanding environment and with outstanding colleagues. How are they equipped if they decide to move on to a failing or coasting school? Berwick recognises the problem: \"We are very conscious that the experience can be very limited in the environment we have got.\" Once staff reach head-of-department level, they are encouraged to train as advanced skills teachers so that they have more opportunity to work with and in other schools, including those involved in the London Challenge to improve outcomes for disadvantaged young people. Berwick says: \"If we don't have experience of working with other schools, we might think that everything we do here is fine. We may be an outstanding school but we have to be an outstanding improving school.\" But he concedes: \"You could say that [staff] experience is limited.\" One of Berwick's eager apprentices is probably already working on a project to increase Raven Wood's exposure to and knowledge of failing schools. In this hothouse environment, it is another opportunity to transform a problem into a leadership success."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
