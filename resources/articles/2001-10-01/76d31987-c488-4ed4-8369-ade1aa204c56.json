Health secretary Alan Milburn has also revealed he has plans to \"buy up\" the entire capacity of individual private hospitals for several years to ensure they are used solely for NHS patients. Speaking to the Commons health committee last night, Mr Milburn said that while he wished that the NHS alone could meet the demand for healthcare, the reality was that it could only be met in collaboration with private hospital operators. He told MPs that the government was looking at extending the formal concordat agreement with the private sector, signed last November to treat 100,000 NHS patients a year in private hospitals - up from 10,500 patients treated in this way over the previous 12 months. The amount of money spent on treating NHS patients privately would double to \u00a340m this year, he said, adding that the government was actively exploring the feasibility of treating more patients in private hospitals in Europe. The NHS was looking to buy up all or part of the capacity of private hospitals either permanently - as with the purchase of the London Heart Hospital earlier this year - or over long periods. \"What we are looking at is not just contracts with a private sector hospital running at low levels of occupancy but effectively buy up for a period of a number of years the total capacity, and monopolise it for NHS patients,\" he said. Asked whether he planned to purchase private hospitals outright and take them under NHS control, he replied: \"If another London Heart hospital came along with that standard of care... would I be interested in making a purchase? Potentially, I would.\" The health committee meeting was the first in a series of hearings planned for the next few weeks investigating the relationship between the private sector and the NHS. Mr Milburn also confirmed that private sector providers would be used to provide new standalone diagnostic and treatment centres used for routine NHS operations such as cataracts and hip replacements. He said that treatment of NHS patients in Europe might become more widespread once pilot schemes testing the idea were completed in the new year, but it was important to make sure that the quality of treatment was acceptable. No NHS patients would be sent abroad for care against their will, he said. Mr Milburn admitted that he \"may have to change the law\" if the NHS decided to pay for the travel costs of patients treated abroad. In the UK, only patients on low incomes receive help with the costs of travelling to hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
