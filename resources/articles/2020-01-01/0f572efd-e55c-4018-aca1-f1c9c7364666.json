Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call.\u201d As America\u2019s first and so far only black president, Obama took a lead on Monday as many US cities held MLK Day events and competing candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination put aside rivalries and rows to march arm-in-arm in South Carolina. In his letter, King decried racial intolerance, writing: \u201cLet us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\u201d Obama\u2019s post came on the same day that predominantly white gun rights supporters marched in Richmond, Virginia, protesting against gun control laws proposed by the state assembly\u2019s new Democratic majority. In contrast, many political leaders offered their appreciation for King, who was assassinated by a white separatist in Memphis in 1968. In Columbia, South Carolina, where a Confederate battle flag was removed from the statehouse cupola in 2000 and only banished entirely in 2015 after a teenaged white supremacist gunmen opened fire in a Charleston Baptist church, killing nine Bible study participants, Democratic presidential candidates gathered in a potent show of unity. Putting aside their recent dispute over the electability of a female candidate, the Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders publicly shook hands at the Zion Baptist church. They then took part in leading a march on the statehouse arm-in-arm with fellow Democratic party 2020 election rivals Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Deval Patrick and Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cThis is the handshake,\u201d Gabbard said as Sanders and Warren reached across her to shake hands in the front row of the church service. In last week\u2019s Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, which holds its caucuses on 3 February to open voting in the 2020 Democratic nomination contest, Warren and Sanders had clashed amid a rumbling row. They had a fiery exchange over what was said during a private conversation about a woman\u2019s chances of becoming president. As Sanders extended his hand on live TV afterward, Warren pulled back and it was later revealed she had accused Sanders of calling her a liar over the disagreement. On Monday, the candidates linked arms and began the six-block walk from the Zion Baptist church to the South Carolina statehouse, singing We Shall Overcome. South Carolina holds its primary on 29 February. Sanders\u2019 spokesman, Michael Wukela, said the King event in South Carolina was about respect, \u201cpure and simple\u201d, noting that racial inequality, including criminal justice and poverty, highlighted the importance of the state\u2019s showcase holiday celebration, known as Columbia\u2019s King Day at the Dome. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand shoulder-to-shoulder with people who face these challenges every day yet still manage to embrace a vision of hope and grace, then you don\u2019t deserve their respect, much less their vote,\u201d Wukela said. Joe Biden, who leads polling in the state with 36% support overall and 43% among black voters, according to a recent Fox News poll, said on Sunday that he feared that the progress made during the 1960s was unraveling. \u201cFolks, some mornings I wake up and I think it\u2019s more like what it must have been in 1920 than 2020,\u201d Biden said. Blaming Donald Trump, he claimed that the progress of the civil rights movement \u201chas not been able to be stopped until recently\u201d. \u201cI thought you could defeat hate \u2026 hate only hides,\u201d he added \ufeff At the White House, the president issued a statement: \u201cToday, we pause to honor the incredible life and accomplishments of Dr King, who helped shape the civil rights movement, gave hope to millions experiencing discrimination, and whose enduring memory inspires us to pursue a more just and equal society.\u201d Trump also tweeted about the day. And later in Washington, a mixture of cheers and boos greeted Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence, as they arrived at the Martin Luther King Jr memorial. They stood at the base of the sculpture for a minute, their heads bowed. Some members of the crowd chanted \u201c U-S-A!\u201d and a few delivered sustained boos."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
