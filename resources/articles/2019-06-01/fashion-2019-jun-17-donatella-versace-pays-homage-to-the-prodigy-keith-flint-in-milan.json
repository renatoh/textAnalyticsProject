The designer described the musician, who died in March this year, as \u201cmy friend, and a disruptor of this world\u201d. Homage was paid through the pounding soundtrack of the band\u2019s monster hit, Firestarter, and models bearing his distinctive double mohawk and tinted bug-eye sunglasses. Although the revelation that Flint and Versace were friends may have come as a surprise, it\u2019s not an incongruous pairing; Versace has been something of a disruptor herself. Picking up the mantle of the family business her brother, Gianni, established in 1978, she embraced full-blown sex appeal in her collections from day one, and has admitted in the past to not knowing how to do things quietly. Last year, she surprised the world when she announced that she sold her family company to Capri Holdings \u2013 formerly known as Michael Kors Holdings. Less than a year into the merger, it is a bit early to say how that is going from a business perspective. On the catwalk, however, it is very much business as usual. Versace described her next-season muse as \u201ca slightly more serious guy\u201d just before the show, adding that she wanted to celebrate the moment \u201ca young man becomes a man\u201d which for her comes the ceremonial purchase of their first car. Models walked around an XL black car covered in purple flowers, wearing suits, shirts and double denim emblazoned and appliqued with car prints \u2013 a continuation from last season\u2019s collaboration with Ford. Continuing a theme from the womenswear show in February, looks featured vintage fragrance advertisements from the brand\u2019s archive. We were told, post-show, that this was a nod to rediscovery; another tribute to the brand\u2019s past without being too obvious. Other themes in this collection didn\u2019t play the same game. The bondage look, which has been synonymous with the house since Gianni\u2019s 1990s collections, appeared via black leather trousers with all-over eyelets and whipstitched seams. The memory of Donatella\u2019s brother was, as ever, evident throughout, with his signature appearing on ties, socks and in all-over Swarovski applique in skintight jersey. Moving the handwriting of the house forward, she adapted its signature baroque print \u2013 usually seen in black and gold \u2013 into acidic pastels. Tailoring, meanwhile, was softened with a less rigid fit on blazers and bootleg jersey trousers \u2013 like the ones Versace favours herself. Versace \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to talk about gender fluidity, more interested in the fluidity of masculinity\u201d, said the company, post preview. The CEO of Capri Holdings, John D Idol, has made clear his plans for the brand\u2019s evolution: there are plans to increase the number of Versace shops from 200 to 300. He added that \u201cwith the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to [sales of] over $2bn\u201d. For her part, Versace is showing she intends to keep up her creative side of such expansion. Earlier in the day, Dolce &amp; Gabbana revealed the latest collection in its brand story. Titled Sicilian Tropical, it featured designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana paying homage to their southern Italian roots with fruit-bowl and piastrelle prints. For the rest of the collection, they went further afield. The set was transformed into an elaborate jungle rainforest which featured a lifesize leopard and jaguar on the stage (not real, but made from sisal by the artist Anne Andersson, and borrowed from the designers\u2019 private collection) and which led on to a 40-yard leopard-print catwalk. On it, the collection was an amalgamation of several themes: baroque, pin-ups, polka dot and the 1950s, we were informed. Retro sports jerseys \u2013 including baseball, tennis, golf, rugby and boxing \u2013 were reimagined in lace \u201cto make it more sexy\u201d, said Gabbana backstage before the show, and emblazoned with messages such as, \u201cChoose me\u201d, \u201cTake a look\u201d and \u201cOnly good vibes\u201d. Elsewhere, khaki dominated the 119-look show, appearing in uniform-fresh, box pleated separates. The duo\u2019s adopted decade was a dominating theme throughout, but, while it may be an era be a decade ripe for mining classic sartorial codes, some \u2013 such as the wide-lapelled double-breasted suits, knitted polos, Cuban-collared shirts and pleated trousers seen here \u2013 are naturally less problematic than others in our woke world. Such expeditions, like those evoked by the khaki section of this show, in the faraway jungle setting conjured voyager vibes which, these days, tend to get talked about in a colonial context rather than recalled in such a way on the runway. Of the setting and direction, Gabbana said before the show: \u201cFashion is beautiful because you change every season.\u201d Different, but familiar, this was a collection that was distinctively Dolce &amp; Gabbana."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
