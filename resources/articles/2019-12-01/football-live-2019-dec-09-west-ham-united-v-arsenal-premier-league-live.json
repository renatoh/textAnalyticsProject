A Ljungberg warning! That\u2019s your lot, then, folks. Thanks for reading this MBM! Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s version. \u201cIt was difficult to understand. We dominated the game for 60 minutes, and then we lost the game. Maybe we should have scored the second goal, it was so important. You must understand the boos, because in the last five games here we did not win. Of course we try to do it. I think we were the better team than Arsenal for 60 minutes, but fans cannot be happy. You cannot concede three goals in every game. Maybe we are not in our best moment, but we will continue fighting. I can fix it.\u201d He\u2019s then pressed by Sky on whether he\u2019ll be given the chance to do so. \u201cIt does not depend on me,\u201d is his sharp response, at which point he walks off. An extremely satisfied Freddie Ljungberg talks to Sky. \u201cIt means so much for the players, they have been living under enormous pressure for the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve seen that in their performances. But we believe in how we want to play football, and I could see around the hour mark that West Ham were starting to tire. We played it a bit crisper, a bit faster, and all of a sudden we sliced them open. The boys were amazing. They stepped up, quicker passing. You need to work hard, in attack and defence, and they did that today. It\u2019s down to the players, I\u2019m just there to guide them a little bit. We still have a lot to work on. We enjoy tonight and start working again tomorrow.\u201d Our man Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium to witness that turnaround. Here\u2019s his report. Arsenal celebrate a deserved win - eventually deserved - with wide smiles, backslaps and hugs. Freddie Ljungberg in the middle of it all. And no wonder, they\u2019re back in the top half of the table, in ninth with 22 points, just two behind fifth-placed Manchester United. West Ham however remain in trouble, stuck in 16th place after taking 16 points from 16 games. They\u2019re just one point above the dropzone, having lost seven of their last nine. Their next game is at Southampton on Saturday evening; Saints will leapfrog them if they win. Arsenal were awful for the first 59 minutes, then sensational for the following nine. Their three-goal second-half blast has lifted the mood around the club, while heaping further pressure on Manuel Pellegrini, who has the boos of the few Hammers fans left in the stadium ringing in his ears. 90 min +5: \u201cWe are staying up!\u201d chant some self-deprecating Arsenal supporters. Or are they merely baiting the remaining West Ham fans? It could be either or both, couldn\u2019t it. 90 min +4: Aubameyang dribbles down the inside left, checks back, makes space to shoot near the penalty spot, and watches his effort ping off the heel of Fredericks and over the bar. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. \u201cFreddie deserves some big props for this turnaround,\u201d writes Adrian Caddy. \u201cWe\u2019d been crying out for Emery to pick a front three with Aubameyang in his best position flanked by Pepe and Martinelli. All three have delivered.\u201d 90 min +2: Arsenal ping it around, and their fans entertain themselves with some repetitive whoops of joy. 90 min: Holland curls one into the Arsenal box from the right. It\u2019s an inviting cross, and Chambers does very well to get in ahead of Haller. He takes a whack for his troubles. As he rolls around, it\u2019s announced there will be seven added minutes. 88 min: More seats flipping up in the stands. It\u2019s the remaining Arsenal fans making all the noise. Pepe is replaced by Reiss Nelson, and receives both a warm ovation from his fans and a hug and a huge smile from Freddie Ljungberg. 86 min: Matteo Guendouzi comes on in his place. \u201cAfter the dismal performance in the first half I must confess that I was preparing a very snarky note to send out to slag the Gunners,\u201d admits Mary Waltz. \u201cI still have low expectations for Arsenal\u2019s remainder of this season but for today they deserve an apology and a tip of the hat from me.\u201d 85 min: Xhaka falls to the turf again, still dizzy, and he\u2019s going to have to go off. He walks off with a wry smile. 83 min: Noble must have been taking notes from Xhaka earlier, because he plays a dismal hospital ball infield from the right, allowing Pepe to tear upfield with great intent. The West Ham captain is fortunate that Pepe\u2019s control lets him down as he enters the area, allowing Balbuena to recover. 82 min: Masuaku makes ground down the left and wedges a cute cross into the mixer, but Sokratis is on hand to clear, winning the battle with Antonio and Haller. 80 min: Xhaka is good to continue. Quite a few seats are now flipped up, plenty of West Ham fans having seen enough. 79 min: Xhaka takes a Masuaku crossfield pass flush in the grid. He\u2019s flat on his back. The trainer comes on to run the rule over him. While we wait, Nathan Holland comes on for Robert Snodgrass. 77 min: Pepe nutmegs Masuaku and enters the box on the right. Pepe goes over Masuaku\u2019s leg, claiming a penalty. He was looking for it, and doesn\u2019t get it. 75 min: Speaking of Brazilians, Martinelli looks the real deal. He powers his way down the inside-right channel, winning a ball he really had no right to earn, and spins to set up Torreira, just inside the box. Torreira gives the ball a good old whack, and his effort is well blocked by Balbuena. 73 min: West Ham can\u2019t get the ball. Arsenal were barely capable of stringing two passes together for the first hour. Now they\u2019re stroking it around with the insouciant arrogance of Brazil during the last ten minutes of the 1970 World Cup final. 71 min: That nine-minute, three-goal Arsenal salvo has stunned West Ham. It could be the end of Manuel Pellegrini. Sebastian Heller comes on for Filipe Anderson. Will that substitution turn out to be one of the manager\u2019s last decisions as West Ham boss? The scoring\u2019s not over. Aubameyang backheels a pass down the right, releasing Pepe into a little bit of grass. Pepe checks and chips a delicate cross back towards the striker, who had kept moving. Aubameyang bicycle kicks into the bottom right. Martin got a hand on the shot, but couldn\u2019t keep it out. 68 min: Filipe Anderson dribbles down the left and loops a cross towards Fornals, who, falling backwards, can\u2019t keep his header, intended for the top right, down. A real sense that the scoring isn\u2019t over. Arsenal were a complete shambles less than ten minutes ago. Now they\u2019re in the lead, and scoring magical goals! Aubameyang slips a pass wide right for Pepe, who shuffles into the box, makes a little bit of space away from Masuaku, and curls an unstoppable shot across Martin and into the top left! The keeper had absolutely no chance with that. 65 min: Balbuena tears down the right, reaches the end of the road and stands one up into the box. Antonio goes over, unable to connect with his head. The West Ham fans want a penalty, but Antonio makes no claim whatsoever. 63 min: That\u2019s really rattled West Ham, who are struggling to clear their lines all of a sudden. Ozil plays a cute right-to-left chip for Martinelli, who can\u2019t quite sort his feet out just inside the area. Had he managed it, he\u2019d have been one on one with Martin. 62 min: That was such a lovely, incisive move, and what a finish by Martinelli! That came out of nowhere, and suddenly the Gunners are pinging the ball around in a very pretty fashion. What a strange game football can be. Pulitzer, please! So having said Arsenal were doing nothing, they suddenly spring into life! Torreira slips a pass down the left for Kolasinac to stride onto. Kolasinac enters the box and pulls back for Martinelli, the young man slamming a glorious first-time shot into the bottom right! 58 min: Arsenal are playing with an almost total lack of confidence. Aubameyang tears down the right and, upon reaching the byline, larrups a dismal cross miles into the sky and out of play on the other wing. The home fans enjoyed that very much. 57 min: Snodgrass causes trouble down the right and cuts back for Rice, who shapes a lovely hard sidefoot towards the bottom right from 20 yards. Leno does extremely well to keep hold of the ball. Rice really struck that, it was a proper whistler. 55 min: Xhaka plays a useless blind pass in from the right to nobody. That allows Snodgrass to zip down the inside-right channel and take a shot that clips off Kolasinac and loops over Leno, nearly dropping into the bottom left. Instead it\u2019s a corner, and Xhaka repairs the damage, sort of, by jumping into a challenge for a high ball backwards, and somehow winning a goal kick. Xhaka really is very entertaining to watch, although I appreciate his unique appeal will be selective. 53 min: Martinelli earns a corner with a determined run down the inside-right channel. Meeting the set piece, Torreira blooters over from an overly ambitious range. Here\u2019s Dean Kinsella: \u201cI\u2019ve been watching top flight English football since Bertie Mee was the Arsenal manager and I\u2019m pretty sure that was the worst half of a game I\u2019ve seen them play in all those 50 or so years. And West Ham were only marginally better by dint of at least trying to play.\u201d 52 min: A minute of the warmest applause for West Ham fan Peter Taylor, who recently passed away. 51 min: Nope, he can\u2019t go on. He limps off, to be replaced by Arthur Masuaku. Ozil then takes the free kick, just to the right of the box. It\u2019s easily slapped clear by Ogbonna. A very poor delivery. 49 min: Pepe drops a shoulder to trick Cresswell, who looks like he\u2019s tweaked something and doesn\u2019t fancy a footrace down the right. So the full-back clatters the winger. Booked. But before any free kick can be taken, the West Ham physio comes on to check if Cresswell can continue. 47 min: Snodgrass gets West Ham on the front foot early doors. He takes the set piece himself. Rice can\u2019t get a header on target. The ball breaks to Noble, who lifts a wild shot miles over the bar. Aubameyang makes his way back upfield holding his head, looking a little woozy. Xhaka checks he\u2019s good to continue. The striker says he\u2019s fine, though he doesn\u2019t look particularly happy. Right, back to the big game ... and West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half. [Taps mike, adopts thick Lancastrian burr] \u201cHey, does anybody remember Kettering Tyres?\u201d Anyway, you requested adjudication on the Crown Paints / Candy thing. Here\u2019s your answer. I mean, obviously. They can\u2019t get it, but trot off down the tunnel looking fairly content. They\u2019re 45 minutes away from a confidence-restoring win. Arsenal by contrast look miserable; they\u2019ve been a lightweight non-event. \u201cYou know how we always used to get irritated by the \u2018hey guys, remember Spangles?\u2019 crowd who would forever be banging on about irrelevant minutiae from the 70s?\u201d asks Tom Atkins, in the rhetorical style. \u201cYou always become the thing you hate the most. That said, Villa is Mita Copiers, Man City always Brother, and Ipswich obviously Fisons. I also think we need an adjudication on Crown Paints vs Candy for Liverpool.\u201d 45 min +3: It\u2019s all West Ham, who are pressing for a second goal that would put the visitors in all sorts of bother. 45 min +1: There will be five additional minutes, Tierney\u2019s injury, VAR, all that. The first sees Aubameyang welt a shot miles over the bar from a very ambitious distance. Arsenal haven\u2019t worked Martin at all. 45 min: Snodgrass is blocked off by Kolasinac as he dribbles down the right. He wants a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting it. It all looked a bit theatrical as he fell backwards, his spine arcing in the dramatic style. 44 min: A bit of space for Pepe, who has been Arsenal\u2019s liveliest player, despite Cresswell\u2019s attention. He makes good down the right and crosses low. Martin, who hasn\u2019t had much to do, gathers confidently. 42 min: Torreira attempts a back-heel a couple of yards from his own box. He nearly lets Antonio in on goal, but gets away with it. That was ludicrous, and it\u2019s no wonder Arsenal are shipping goals like they\u2019re going out of fashion. 40 min: This is preposterous. VAR takes nearly two minutes to work out whether Ogbonna had headed the ball onto his outstretched fist, en route to the goal via Maitland-Niles\u2019 back. It was nowhere near, but it took them about 200 replays to decide. Anyway, it\u2019s all good. Whither spontaneous joy? Cresswell wins a corner down the left. He hoicks it long. Some pinball. Noble takes a whack. More pinball. Rice flicks the ball towards Fornals, to the right of the six-yard box. He dinks it back in. Ogbonna wants it the most, and his desire wins out. His header, towards the top left, twangs off Maitland-Niles\u2019 back and into the top right, past the wrong-footed Leno. 36 min: Pepe\u2019s down for a while. That was a rare old whack. Cresswell got the ball, but took his man on the follow-through. The landing looked ugly, with Pepe\u2019s leg trapped, his knee twisting. But there\u2019s good news, as Pepe slowly gathers himself and gets back on his feet. He\u2019ll be good to continue ... and he glances towards Cresswell with great intensity. This might not be over. 34 min: Antonio swerves his way down the left and has a batter from a tight angle. Leno does extremely well to save. Arsenal make their way up the other end through Pepe, who is unceremoniously stopped by an extremely robust challenge from Cresswell, sliding in from the left. 33 min: Pepe dribbles with purpose down the right but can\u2019t find anyone with his cutback. Aubameyang drops a shoulder out on the left, and stands one up for Ozil, who heads over harmlessly from six yards. He was leaning back to reach that, perhaps Pepe behind him would have been a better bet. I wonder if the flag might have gone up for offside had that flown in. VAR would certainly have taken a look. 31 min: Tierney\u2019s injury has disrupted whatever rhythm this game previously had. It\u2019s all a bit scrappy. \u201cPermit me to launch myself into Operation Showing Your Age.\u201d Jump in, Mike Morris, the water\u2019s lovely. \u201cEverton shall forever be sponsored by NEC while Liverpool have to make do with Candy, for some reason. Man United\u2019s eternal sponsor is Sharp, JVC for Arsenal, and Tottenham are sponsored by Holsten Pils. Now excuse me while I nostalgically yearn for football being four square passes, and then back to the goalie from the halfway line.\u201d 29 min: Tierney walks off, using that lovely yellow-and-black shirt as a sling. The poor lad\u2019s replaced by Saed Kolasinac, who wasn\u2019t even on the bench until Hector Bellerin pulled a hamstring in the warm-up. 28 min: Tierney is down, having tussled with Antonio in the middle of a melee as Leno gathered. Nobody\u2019s fault, just an accident as the pair locked arms. It appears the young full-back has popped his shoulder. That\u2019s a sore one, and he\u2019s not going to be able to continue. 26 min: Snodgrass loops it long. Ogbonna rises to head at the far post, but can only send the ball backwards. It drops to Fornals, who opens his body for a sidefoot volley. His attempt is weak and dribbles into the arms of Leno. 25 min: Snodgrass and Tierney battle down the West Ham right. Tierney clips his Scotland team-mate on the toe, and this is a free kick just to the right of the box. Snodgrass will take this himself. 24 min: Snodgrass is booked for a fairly agricultural slide on Martinelli, who was hoping to skitter off up the left flank. Nope! Not allowed! 22 min: Instead of hoicking the ball into the mixer, Noble plays it down the inside-right channel for Anderson to chase. Anderson can\u2019t control, running the ball out of play. He tangles with Xhaka, coming in from the side, maybe a little behind. West Ham want the penalty, because there\u2019s contact as the pair fall. They\u2019re not getting it. VAR isn\u2019t interested either, but you have seen them awarded. One of those. 21 min: Torreira clatters into Snodgrass, the pair competing for a 50-50 out on the right. It\u2019s a free kick for West Ham in a dangerous position. A chance to load the Arsenal box. 19 min: Arsenal knock it around a bit. Aubameyang thinks he\u2019s been blocked off illegally while pelting down the right, but the referee\u2019s not having any of it, much to the home support\u2019s amusement. 17 min: West Ham are clearly minded to give Maitland-Niles, a late replacement for Bellerin, a workout. Most of their work is out on the left. Cresswell probes, and nearly breaks clear, but the defender sticks to his task and eventually wins out, with a little help from Pepe. 15 min: Pepe tries to flick his way out of a tight spot out on the West Ham left. Cresswell\u2019s not having it, blocks him, and wins a throw. From that, Anderson jigs into the box looking dangerous, but there\u2019s one too many yellow shirt to beat, and eventually he dribbles into trouble. 14 min: West Ham string together a few passes for the first time. It\u2019s very easy on the eye, and the move ends with Cresswell nearly releasing Fornals down the left. Nearly, but not quite. 12 min: Arsenal have enjoyed 85 percent of possession so far. West Ham seem fairly happy to sit back and keep their shape, hoping to nick the ball and hit the visitors on the break. 10 min: A positive early touch by young Martinelli, who drops a shoulder and wins a corner on the left. Nothing comes of the set piece, but both teams look well up for attack. 8 min: A decent run by Fornals down the left, though it comes to nought. West Ham look to be in a fairly positive mood. \u201cFor Everton, it has to be Hafnia,\u201d argues Stephen Carr. \u201cThey made tinned meat.\u201d Such a shame that wasn\u2019t on their shirt during the Dogs of War era. 6 min: West Ham spring to life, Noble and Anderson driving down the middle and setting up Antonio, who lashes high over the bar. Then they come again and force a corner down the right. Torreira is smacked upside the head and it\u2019s a free kick, though Cresswell takes a shot anyway. Did he hit the post?! The camera didn\u2019t track the ball, but there was an almighty thud. He gave it some welly. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t have counted so the point is moot. 4 min: It\u2019s a quiet start, the crowd noise notwithstanding. \u201cIn reference to JVC being the Arsenal sponsor, as a younger football fan I always think of O2 as the quintessential Arsenal kit, when Thierry Henry used to tear teams apart,\u201d writes Pat Smith Willocks. \u201cSimilarly, I think Carlsberg as the Liverpool kit, and Capital One for Sheffield United under Neil Warnock, featuring a young Phil Jagielka who has been my idol ever since.\u201d It\u2019s a good game, this. I\u2019d plump for Hitachi for Liverpool, Crown Paints at a push, with Laver the timber merchant for the Blades. But then I\u2019m getting on a bit. 2 min: Arsenal stroke it around the back awhile, getting a feel of the ball. They go nowhere, but that\u2019s not really the point, as they play the patient game, hoping to take some of the heat out of the stadium. Here we go, then! Arsenal get the ball rolling. \u201cI am a Scot living in Canada and it\u2019s the first I\u2019d heard of a shoogly peg. I had to look it up. Love it. But surely the English have their own term for living precariously? Or they sure will pretty damn soon.\u201d Topical satire\u2019s Brian Cruickshank, there, ladies and gentlemen, with a little bit of politics. Speaking of which ... VOTE LABOUR. Or Green, SNP, Plaid, Lib Dem, etc. The teams are out! A derby atmosphere at the London Stadium. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes, and a rousing rendition of Bubbles. But before we begin, Hammers fan Ian Sargeant wishes to address the aforementioned old Too Good To Go Down saw. \u201cThey said that in 2002/3 when we had some real young stars (Cole, Carrick, Defoe, Johnson) along side the likes of James, Kanoute, di Canio and Sinclair. We also said it at a pre-season friendly v Wycombe the following term - all those bar Paolo were on the pitch and we went 2-0 down in 15 minutes.\u201d A late change to the Arsenal team. Hector Bellerin tweaked a hamstring in the warm-up, and he\u2019ll be replaced by Ainsley Maitland-Niles at right-back. Sead Kolasinac takes Maitland-Niles\u2019 place on the bench. Manuel Pellegrini talks. \u201cWhen Antonio played the last game against Chelsea, he was a very important striker for us with his power and speed. Unfortunately for him he had more pain and couldn\u2019t play against Wolverhampton but now he is 100 percent fit. Here at home we have had one point from the last four, so we will try to win. I hope we can add three points. We can play better against big teams. We must look for the future.\u201d West Ham United will be playing in their famous claret and blue. Plus the addition of some Rainbow Laces, in support of Stonewall\u2019s campaign to make the game more inclusive for LGBT people. Arsenal will play in yellow, with bruised-banana zig-zags. A delightful homage to this bonny sweater from the early 1990s. Arsenal should never have changed that badge. The Arsenal sponsor for those of a certain vintage, too. The pre-match thoughts of Freddie Ljungberg, who is talking a good attack-minded game. \u201cThere are a lot of games going on in December, so there is fatigue and stuff. We want to get a little energy into the team and shake things up a little bit. Martinelli has done really well in the Europa League, scoring goals for us. He works hard and is very quick, I think he will do really well. Pepe did really well in the second half in the last game. I want him to be who he is, go one against one, and be difficult to read. At the same time I want him to do his defensive work, that\u2019s important playing away from home.\u201d West Ham make one change to the team named for the defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Sebastien Haller drops to the bench, having scored just four times so far this season, and only one in his last 12. Michail Antonio returns to take his place. The 18-year-old striker Gabriel Martinelli starts his first Premier League game for Arsenal. He replaces Alexandre Lacazette. That\u2019s one of four changes to the side that went down at home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Calum Chambers and Kieran Tierney replace David Luiz and Sead Kolasinac at the back, while Nicolas Pepe takes Joe Willock\u2019s spot. West Ham United: Martin, Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Snodgrass, Noble, Rice, Fornals, Felipe Anderson, Antonio. Subs: Zabaleta, Roberto, Sanchez, Haller, Diop, Masuaku, Holland. Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Chambers, Papastathopoulos, Tierney, Torreira, Xhaka, Pepe, Ozil, Martinelli, Aubameyang. Subs: Lacazette, Maitland-Niles, Luiz, Nelson, Martinez, Guendouzi, Saka. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Welcome to the re-run of the 1980 FA Cup final. That\u2019s how all the kids are styling this, right? Ah memories! Trevor Brooking\u2019s header, Willie Young on Paul Allen, a nice big riff in Fever Pitch, all that. Nearly 40 years on, that remains West Ham\u2019s last trophy. Since then, they\u2019ve mainly spent their time packing their teams with top talent and finding themselves inexplicably involved in relegation battles. The Hammers are in bother again. They\u2019ve won just one of their last nine league matches, an eyebrow-raising victory at Chelsea a couple of Saturdays ago. It\u2019s a dismal run that\u2019s seen them plummet down the table. They\u2019ve gone 3-0 down in their last two home fixtures. They\u2019re just a single point better off than Southampton in the relegation spots, and look what a mess they\u2019ve been. You\u2019d definitely file West Ham under Too Good To Go Down ... but then the club has been here before, too many times, so nobody will be taking anything for granted. They could desperately do with three points that\u2019d whizz them up to 13th place at least, a result that would change the picture and the mood totally. It might also be what\u2019s required to save Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s job, which is hanging from a shoogly peg. Oh look! Here come Arsenal. The Gunners are in turmoil, having sacked off Unai Emery, then failed to get a honeymoon bounce under caretaker Freddie Ljungberg. They\u2019re on a nine-game winless streak in all competitions, and can\u2019t defend for toffee right now, having shipped two goals in their last five matches, and failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 11. It\u2019s their worst run since 1977, and their worst start to a season since 1994-95. They\u2019re only four clear of the dropzone themselves. A win here would buy the club some precious time and space in which to do some calm thinking. Two teams not currently in best of nick, then. Which could either make for some shoddy viewing, or glorious entertainment! We\u2019re plumping for the latter. Can the Hammers replicate their Declan Rice-inpsired 1-0 win of last season? Or could the Gunners revisit their 5-1 victory here in 2016? Anything could happen, and it should be fun finding out. It\u2019s on!
