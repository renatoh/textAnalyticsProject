Instead of sanctioning an immediate walkout, the Unite union is considering a five-day strike from 24-28 May. The first of four five-day strikes was due to take place on Tuesday but was blocked by a high court order that Unite described as a \"landmark attack on free trade unionism\". BA flight attendants would be able to walk out as soon as the injunction is lifted, having given BA notice of the strike dates, but Unite officials are keeping open the option of moving to the next block of walkouts. The remaining strike dates are 30 May to 3 June and 5-9 June. BA said it operated 100% of its long-haul operation at Heathrow today as the airline gradually wound down a strike contingency programme that included a reduced flight schedule. Short-haul flights are taking longer to return to normal, with only two-thirds of services operating from Britain's largest airport. The walkouts were blocked after the airline argued successfully that Unite made inadequate efforts to inform members of a strike ballot result in February. Errors included the failure to disseminate the fact that 11 of the 9,282 ballots cast had been spoiled. One of the three senior judges hearing the appeal, Lady Justice Smith, said: \"In this case, the numbers [of spoiled papers] are so small that they can't be of interest to anybody.\" Unite has indicated that it will hold another ballot if the injunction is upheld. The original cause of the industrial dispute, over reductions to on-board staffing levels, has been supplanted by a row over the removal of staff travel perks for the estimated 2,500 cabin crew who took part in seven days of walkouts in March. BA is refusing to fully reinstate those perks and grant the equivalent of a suspended sentence to 55 flight attendants undergoing disciplinary proceedings. A legal expert played down any threat to the job security of staff who took part in strikes that could be declared illegal if the February ballot is deemed unlawful. Marc Meryon, industrial relations partner at Bircham Dyson Bell, said: \"Even if the strikes were retrospectively found to be lawful, the participants still enjoy protection against dismissal under the law.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
