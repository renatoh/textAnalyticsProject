My seven-year-old daughter was singing Fr\u00e8re Jacques rather too loudly. My boyfriend was silent, presumably remembering many a steamy film set in such blissful scenery. We were driving through the gentle French countryside in a soft-top classic Citro\u00ebn 2CV, of indeterminate years. Like all women of a certain age, she had disguised her date of manufacture even from her owners. The most they could say was \"over 20 years old\", which I think was very gallant, as she was probably pushing 30 at least. I ought to explain that none of my family is a car enthusiast, and neither myself, my boyfriend, nor my daughter for that matter, had driven or even sat in a 2CV before. But although we weren't interested in classic cars, we were interested in what promised to be a classic experience - spending a long weekend driving around the heart of south-west France in a piece of French history. I imagined myself as some old movie star, scarf about my head, dark sunglasses with wings, and a ruthlessly-waisted flowered frock billowing in the breeze. A 2CV and the rolling cognac vineyards of Charente were as meant for each other as Parmesan and pasta. Or, as Monsieur Richon, our host at La Templerie, the 17th-century gte where we stayed, put it: \"Le Camembert, le beret, et le Deux Chevaux!\" Monsieur was very droll. \"Campagne,\" was all he said, opening the wooden shutters on to a postcard of green hills lined with his very own 20 hectacres of vines. \"Breakfast time?\" I asked. He replied languidly, \"Whenever you want.\" The other guests, all French, with whom we shared croissant and unsalted butter around La Templerie's breakfast table, had many a story from their youth to tell about 2CVs. One plump woman from Paris informed us that you could take out the seats and have a picnic sitting in them. An engineer from the Channel Tunnel announced with authority, \"The Deux Chevaux is not a French car, it's a French legend,\" and recommended a number of books to read on its history and cultural significances. Madame Richon gave me a bit of advice. \"You have to love the car for having personality,\" she said. \"It is part of the experience. Part of the romance.\" The car's personality was soon apparent. On day one, the accelerator fell off. I picked it up from the floor of the car, holding on to the steering wheel with my other hand, and tried to slot it back on again. My seven-year-old offered to help. She would, as it happened, have been more qualified than I, having spent long afternoons making oddly shaped and very imaginative machines out of Meccano. Because 2CVs are like kit cars, you could practically build one yourself. In fact, some people do. Each morning began with a similar bang. \"Toute vitesse!\" cheered my boyfriend as we went up to 40km per hour at full throttle. \"Another adventure!\" cheered my seven-year-old. She wasn't referring to our picnic by the side of the green and murky Charente river, which curves so confusingly due north that you have to cross it several times; nor to the trip into the nearby market town of Angoul me to buy boxes of tiny wild strawberries; not even to the excursion to the Letuffe chocolate factory, where they let you taste the sweets and dip your finger into the melting pot. What excited her was our car. Travelling in a 2CV is a unique eye on the world. All your senses are filtered through the overpowering presence of your rattling, violently vibrating car. It soon becomes as addictive as it is exhausting. After a hard day behind the wheel, the Templerie beckoned as an oasis of stationary silence, and a place for a quick dip to wash off the dust. My daughter, struggling with her French pronunciation, called the swimming pool the \"piss-in\", which was probably pretty accurate given that the average age of those who swam in it was three. Monsieur Richon took us around his distillery where, in a Heath Robinson of brass pipes and huge wooden barrels on a dirt floor, he brews pineau, a fortified wine, from his own grapes. The sweet smell in the dark, dank room was overpowering. Monsieur removed the cork from the centre of one barrel to let us breathe in the intoxicating smell. His family had been manufacturing this pleasure, sitting in the same 17th-century outhouse and sticking the labels on bottles by hand using a big old-fashioned glue pot, for the past 250 years. On Wednesdays, he took a couple of crates of his bottles into Angoul me and sold them at the market. Pineau rouge was designed to be drunk as an aperitif or \"avec chocolat\"; pineau ros\u00e9 was to be taken with melon or the tiny berry-sized wild strawberries; but the cream of the crop, pineau blanc, was to be imbibed with the local speciality, foie gras. \"Big headache drink,\" said Monsieur, struggling with his English. A local farmer friend of the Richons visited one evening with his very own foie gras, as well as smoked duck slices and something that turned out to be roast neck of fowl. None of it looked very appetising, but together it did something to your sense of taste that is almost indescribable. The foods of Charente certainly stimulate your tongue - and widen your waistline. Thankfully, a couple of vibrating, rattling hours in our 2CV was as good as a workout. At least, when I rose each morning my limbs ached as if I'd had a major gym session the day before. It was hard to tear ourselves away from the hedonistic haven of La Templerie for another day of adventure - and ridicule. Naively south London, we thought we were classic travellers in France. The French thought we were a joke. Everywhere we went, we raised chuckles. Cheers of, \"Aha, les Anglais!\" went up as we arrived at a restaurant for our evening meal. \"You're the ones with the Deux Chevaux!\" You certainly could spot us a kilometre off. First, there was the noise. Even the tick of the indicator was as loud as a grandfather clock. \"It's surprising how sanguine you get about the accelerator falling off,\" said my boyfriend, holding it up in his hand again. Usually, we stalled to a stop. Then, shaken and stirred, we fell out (you don't get out of a 2CV). On the final day of our long weekend, our 2CV finally gave up. We sat on the verge of a country lane, waiting for the mechanicWe told him that the accelerator was self-removing. \"C'est normal,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders. We reported that the passenger door didn't open, which necessitated climbing over into the driver's seat to get out. \"C'est un Deux Chevaux,\" he said, as if we were mad to complain. We clambered into the back of the mechanic's car, and looked out of the back window at our 2CV, which was waiting to be rescued, an ageing damsel in distress. Back at the garage, the only car they could give us as a replacement was a classic Mini - \"over 20 years old\" was all they knew about her. She was also very handsome, with a walnut dashboard and an over-enthusiastic heater which wouldn't switch off, so she was rather like a mobile sauna. As we drove back up the gravel path of La Templerie, the Channel Tunnel engineer saw us and announced, \"Vous avez un auto Anglais.\" \"It's not an English car,\" I said, mustering all my national pride. \"It's an English legend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
