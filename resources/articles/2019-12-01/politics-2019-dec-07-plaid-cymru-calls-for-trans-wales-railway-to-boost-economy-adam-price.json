Sitting in a cramped two-carriage train trundling from Cardiff to Holyhead, Price expressed frustration that it was not possible to travel between south and north Wales by train without crossing into England. He said improving rail routes in Wales could stop a brain drain of young people, and he suggested his country could become a test-bed for new rail technology such as hydrogen-powered trains. The Guardian joined Price on the 9.21am from Cardiff Central as he headed north on the campaign trail. The train heads east to Newport and then north to Abergavenny. Before reaching Holyhead on Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n), it twice crosses into England and back into Wales, travelling through Herefordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire. The journey \u2013 about 225 miles as the crow flies \u2013 takes four hours and 53 minutes, if running on time. On Friday it was already behind schedule by the time it reached Newport. \u201cWelcome to transport in Wales,\u201d said Price, whose single ticket cost \u00a388. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to scour the railway maps of Europe, I can\u2019t think of any other country where you have to go into another country next door to travel from the south to north. It\u2019s a unique Welsh experience. It\u2019s extremely frustrating and we want to do something about it. \u201cAnyone who has ever tried to get around Wales by train knows that what we have now is a crumbling, 19th-century rail system that simply isn\u2019t fit for purpose. We have about 5% of the UK\u2019s population and yet we get just 1% of rail investment. We have cancelled electrification, and meanwhile the vanity project that is HS2 presses ahead. Never mind a high-speed rail link north to south, Wales doesn\u2019t even have a low-speed rail link north to south.\u201d One of the most eye-catching policies in the Plaid manifesto is a \u00a320bn green jobs revolution. As part of that, Plaid wants to reopen a stretch from Carmarthen, in south-west Wales, to the coastal town of Aberystwyth, in mid-Wales, that has been closed since 1965. Plaid envisages a second phase in which missing links between mid and north Wales would be filled in. Price argued that a trans-Wales route would make communities such as Aberystwyth and Bangor, both thriving university towns, much more connected with the south and Cardiff. \u201cA key problem in west Wales is the loss of young people from these communities. Investing in transport infrastructure such as the railways sends a message that you can stay here and still be connected to the world. You don\u2019t need to be in central London, or central Cardiff for that matter, to have a successful business career.\u201d Price pointed out that there was no strong rail link between communities where the Welsh language is strong, in the north-west and south-west. \u201cThose communities share a lot in common,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make those connections to create a sense of a united country.\u201d A report commissioned by the Welsh government said reopening the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth line was feasible and would cost \u00a3775m. Plaid\u2019s manifesto spells out other rail plans, including creating a cross-rail for the valleys in south Wales and electrifying all major lines by 2030. Price said a silver lining for the rail industry in Wales was that decades of under-investment meant it was pretty much a blank slate. \u201cYou\u2019re starting from scratch in many ways, so instead of being behind the curve we could be at the leading edge, not playing catch-up but leap-frogging, thinking what the world is going to be like in 2050. There\u2019s an opportunity for us to be a test-bed for technology such as hydrogen trains \u2013 an infrastructure laboratory for the 21st century.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
