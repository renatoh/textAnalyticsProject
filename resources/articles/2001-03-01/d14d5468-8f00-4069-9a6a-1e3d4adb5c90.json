As the foot and mouth crisis continues to spread and the British weather shows no signs of improving, getting away for Easter makes good sense. Unfortunately, many of the hot spots are already full. It's the second-biggest holiday season of the year and destinations with guaranteed sun such as the Caribbean and the Canaries have been booked up. Early bookers have snapped up the best deals (remember, nowadays some of the best discounts are offered early) but there are some holidays available especially if you concentrate your search on places such as Eilat, Majorca and Florida. Short breaks to Paris and other European cities are also a good bet. Don't despair just yet if you are planning to spend Easter abroad and are worried about the threat of strike action by air traffic controllers over the bank holiday. Even the controllers' spokesman has urged passengers not to change their plans until closer to Easter. Many threats of industrial action are just that. For the family The Red Sea is a good bet for hot weather without the long-haul hassle of flying with fidgety kids and there are lots of quality hotels. Flying time is around five hours, not much more than the Canaries. Eilat is also good value for money as travellers continue to be put off by unrest in the Middle East - the troubles do not affect Eilat. Jerusalem is not off-limits for day trips but tourists are advised to use tour guides and to avoid it completely on Fridays. Take the kids snorkelling with Longwood Holidays (020 8551 4494).
