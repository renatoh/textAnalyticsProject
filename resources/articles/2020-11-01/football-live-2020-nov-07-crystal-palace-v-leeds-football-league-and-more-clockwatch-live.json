Should you still want more, Scott Murray is liveblogging Chelsea v Sheffield United. Ta-ra! The 17-year-old Pedri scores for the first time in La Liga to complete a big victory for Barcelona. The scoreline is a little harsh on Betis, who were in the game for a long time, even with 10 men. FA Cup first round Canvey Island, the lowest-ranked team in the FA Cup, have reached the second round with a memorable 2-1 victory over Banbury United. You can check all the results here. The substitute Lionel Messi gets his second goal to seal victory for Barcelona. Championship Watford have moved up to second with a 3-2 win over Coventry. Norwich are third after beating Swansea 1-0, and Bournemouth\u2019s excellent 3-1 victory at Birmingham moves them up to fourth. The FA Cup winners move up to fourth by thrashing poor Bristol City. According to BT Sport, Bristol City had to play a weakened team after one player tested positive for Covid-19 and four others had to self-isolate. They asked the FA whether they could postpone the game; the FA said no. Palace move into the top six, at least for the next three hours, with a clinical counter-attacking performance. Roy Hodgson will be a very happy man tonight. Loren Moron, who has just come on as a substitute, has given ten-man Betis an outside chance of an unlikely point at the Camp Nou. Ellen White gets her second and Manchester City\u2019s eighth. Ach, you have to feel for Bristol City, who are having a desperate WSL season: played five, lost five, conceded 28. Crystal Palace 4-1 Leeds Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s team have now conceded 17 goals in the Premier Leaguye this season, more than any other team. They should score enough goals to stay up comfortably, but it\u2019s a worry. Another important late goal at Carrow Road. Emi Buendia sets up Marco Stiepermann, who slams the ball in off the post. S-E-V-E-N. Championship Barnsley now lead 2-0 at Derby, who are in big trouble, while Ismaila Sarr\u2019s penalty has put Watford 3-2 up against Coventry. Lionel Messi scores his 6441322390th goal for Barcelona to extend their lead over Betis, who are also down to ten men after Aissa Mandi was sent off for handling on the line. Dortmund v Bayern (5.30pm) Jadon Sancho starts for Dortmund in Der Klassiker, but Jude Bellingham is only on the bench. In other news It\u2019s all over at Selhurst Park. Wilfried Zaha plays in Jordan Ayew, who belts the ball through Illan Meslier. Leeds are facing back-to-back 4-1 defeats.

Bundesliga The early games have all finished, and these are the final scores: Augsburg 0-3 Hertha Berlin Mainz 2-2 Schalke RB Leipzig 3-0 Freiburg Stuttgart 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt Union Berlin 5-0 Arminia Bielefeld Barcelona 1-1 Betis Lionel Messi has come on at half-time in place of Ansu Fati.

A cracking free-kick from Angelino has sealed a comfortable win for Leipzig. Championship David Brooks has made it Birmingham 0-3 Bournemouth at St Andrew\u2019s. Bournemouth will move within two points of the leaders Reading with this victory. FA Cup first round You can get all the latest news on our live scores page. Here are a few of the more interesting scorelines: Boreham Wood 2-0 Southend Sunderland 0-1 Mansfield Brackley Town 2-0 Bishop\u2019s Stortford Ipswich 1-2 Portsmouth This is getting messy. That missed penalty from Antoine Griezmann is looking costly now. Tonny Sanabria has equalised for Betis from Cristian Tello\u2019s cross; it doesn\u2019t flatter them. That\u2019s a decent result for Spurs against a good Reading side. They are still looking for their first win but have some less difficult fixtures coming up. Everton 1-3 Manchester United A bit of reaction from Goodison Park, where Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was on one during his post-match interview. The excellent Marcel Sabitzer scores an emphatic penalty to give Leipzig a two-goal cushion at home to Freiburg. \u201cNo goals yet between Hearts - Inverness and Ayr - Dunfermline, Rob, though Falkirk are one up at Partick,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cNo late comeback for Orkney at Invergordon either as it finished 2-0 to the home side. I note also that Sky will be showing Scotland failing to qualify for their eleventh major finals in a row free-to-air on Thursday, so that we can all share the misery. How thoughtful.\u201d If you want to recall their last appearance at a major final - and who wouldn\u2019t want to kick around such happy memories - this is for you. You can see all the half-time scores in the Championship by clicking here. There have only been five goals in ten games, so you won\u2019t be overwhelmed. \u201cIt is probably a good thing that fans are not allowed in to watch games at the moment,\u201d says Ian Morris. \u201cIf these very picky offside decisions continue when fans are let in, I can see an eventual situation arise where they may be a mass pitch invasion hell bent on lynching the officials and destroying the VAR monitor. What happened to the good old days where were not bothered about someone\u2019s toe/bicep/shirt/knee being two millimetres offside? It was hardly creating an advantage was it?\u201d Biceps!!! Barcelona 1-0 Real Betis Antoine Griezmann has had a penalty saved by Claudio Bravo. It\u2019s not been his year, has it. Make that three goals in five minutes! Lucy Bronze has scored her first goal since returning to English football. Two goals in four minutes for Manchester City. Keira Walsh has made it 3-1, and her goal should secure a much-needed win. City (Manchester) are in front for the second time. It was an expert finish from Laura Coombs, who ran onto a long pass and lobbed the ball calmly over Sophie Baggaley. Palace have restored their two-goal lead thanks to a bizarre own goal from Helder Costa. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no point in cheering a goal anymore,\u201d says Clive Naylor. \u201cWe may as well shout \u2018Howzat?\u2019\u201d Ousmane Dembele has given Barcelona the lead with a storming goal. He cut inside from the right, onto his left foot, and thrashed a drive through Claudio Bravo. \u201cI mean, I appreciate this might not be the main talking point regarding Bamford\u2019s offside,\u201d begins Matt Dony, \u201cbut could I direct your attention to the entry for \u2018biceps\u2019 in the Guardian Style Guide? With this level of pedantry, I\u2019m hoping to get a job in Stockley Park...\u201d Oh I say! \u201cI\u2019m sure there was something wrong with that second Bamford goal,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything even after multiple replays but I think VAR needs to look at it until it finds something.\u201d Championship There have only been four goals so far in the 3pm games: Birmingham 0-1 Bournemouth Derby 0-1 Barnsley Huddersfield 0-1 Luton Forest 1-0 Wycombe Pick those out! WSL It\u2019s still 1-1 in both this afternoon\u2019s games. Spurs and Reading have just over half an hour to play; Manchester City and Bristol City are 25 minutes into the first half. Patrick Bamford has smacked Leeds back into the game at Selhurst Park. This time it counts.

Eberechi Eze has put Palace 2-0 ahead with a sumptuous free-kick, his first goal for the club. The Bundesliga half-time scores Augsburg 0-1 Hertha Berlin Mainz 2-1 Schalke RB Leipzig 1-0 Freiburg Stuttgart 2-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Union Berlin 3-0 Arminia Bielefeld The Bamford goal has been ruled out by VAR because his bicep was offside as he pointed to where he wanted the ball. Don\u2019t. Leeds were behind for only five minutes. Patrick Bamford has equalised, finishing coolly after a lovely team move. Ebony Salmon has equalised straight away! An own goal from the Bristol City keeper Sophie Baggaley has put Manchester City ahead in their WSL match. But... Scott Dann gives Palace the lead with a thumping header from a corner! Championship Here\u2019s our match report from the Madejski Stadium, where the leaders Reading took one hell of a beating. These are the latest scores in our featured games: Premier League Crystal Palace 0-0 Leeds WSL Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Reading (2pm) Man City 0-0 Bristol City Championship Reading 0-3 Stoke City (FT) Norwich 0-0 Swansea La Liga Barcelona v Real Betis (3.15pm) Bundesliga Leipzig 1-0 Freiburg (2.30pm) GOAL! Leipzig 1-0 Freiburg (Konate 26) Talking of hipster darlings, Ibrahima Konate has given Leipzig the lead. Premier League Here\u2019s more on Manchester United\u2019s impressive 3-1 win at Everton, which should keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in a job for a wee while. The other early FA Cup game has finished Exeter 2-1 AFC Fylde. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cHere\u2019s a what if for yourself or the readers: if you could put Marcelo Bielsa in charge of any squad in the world, just to see what would happen, what he could achieve with his principles and methods, which would you chose and why? (Those saying the GOP will not be counted.)\u201d Good question. How about Millwall? I like the idea of them becoming hipster darlings. Everyone likes us, we don\u2019t care. FA Cup first round The first game of the day was entirely free of romance. It finished Tonbridge Angels 0-7 Bradford City. GOAL! Spurs 1-1 Reading (Neville 25) Ashleigh Neville has equalised for Spurs! Barcelona v Real Betis team news Barcelona (4-3-3) ter Stegen; Sergi Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Jordi Alba; de Jong, Busquets, Pedri; Dembele, Griezmann, Fati.

Premier League Edinson Cavani has scored his first goal for Manchester United to seal an excellent victory at Everton. Scott Murray has more news. Full time: Reading 0-3 Stoke Jacob Brown\u2019s injury-time goal has completed a thumping win for Stoke against the leaders Reading. Who knew? \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cNo SPL games today, as Rangers and (crisis club) Celtic were both in Europa League action on Thursday, so don\u2019t play until tomorrow. Dundee United ground out a valuable point at St. Mirren last night, the best thing about the game being that the second half fog meant that I couldn\u2019t actually see how bad United were. A point\u2019s a point, mind. Should be a couple of decent games in the Scottish Championship today as Hearts play Inverness at Tynecastle, and Ayr welcome Dunfermline. In Scottish League One the pick of the games is Partick v Falkirk, and in Scottish League Two Cowdenbeath, aka the Blue Brazil, travel to Stanraer.\u201d And since you asked, Orkney are 2-0 down at Invergordon. Championship It\u2019s still Reading 0-2 Stoke with just over 10 minutes remaining. That would be a terrific result for Stoke, who lost their last two away games at Watford and Swansea.

This afternoon at Selhurst Park, their teams will meet for the first time. What a contrasting pair they are.
