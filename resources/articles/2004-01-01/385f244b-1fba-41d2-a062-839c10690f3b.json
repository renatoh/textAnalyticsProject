The survey, carried out by the Institute of Employment Studies, also revealed that midwives are generally unhappy with their professional lot. The institute collected 97,000 questionnaires on behalf of 99 London trusts between 2000 and 2002, in line with Department of Health requirements to survey staff annually about their work experiences. Midwives just topped the league of NHS staff experiencing poor treatment by patients and their relatives, with almost two fifths (38%) saying they had experienced \"some form of harassment or violence, including verbal, racial, sexual and physical abuse\". They were followed in the survey by hospital nurses (36%), healthcare assistants (33%) and doctors (25%). When broken down by category, midwives also experience the highest levels of racial harassment. However the brunt of violent incidents fall on healthcare assistants, almost half (49%) of whom said they had been assaulted by patients and relatives in the course of their work, followed by nurses (40%), doctors (24%) and midwives (20%). IES senior research fellow Dilys Robinson said the bleak findings nevertheless betray a \"good news story\", which has seen a year-on-year fall in the level of harassment respondents have reported since 2000. \"When the report comes out later this month, it is going to be a good news story, although there are still areas where further action is needed\", she said. \"Violence or harassment of staff remains an issue, although it has been getting better.\" The Royal College of Midwives was \"stunned\" by the survey's findings, according to Melanie Every, regional manager for the south-east. \"Although we are aware that quite often women and their relatives can get abusive in the period surrounding labour, we do not get contacted by our members as much as this survey would lead you to believe.\" However, the prevalence of racial abuse chimed with the experiences of midwives who contacted the college to report offensive behaviour, she said. \"When members do contact us about abuse it is very often racially motivated or there is a racial element to it.\" The full report will be published on January 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
