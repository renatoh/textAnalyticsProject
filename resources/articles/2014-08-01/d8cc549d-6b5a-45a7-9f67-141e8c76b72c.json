It's that he believes too much that an independent Scotland would be self-evidently splendid. It leads him to assume that everyone who is against the concept is a fool or a coward. So his main tactic in his debate with Alastair Darling was to try to catch out a man who, in his eyes, is too cautious, too scared, too sensible. The slew of \"But you said \u2026\" quotes from this newspaper and that, which Salmond used to try to make Darling look inconsistent, were too personal, all about undermining his opponent. It looked petty and trivial. To win the debate, Salmond had to win over Darling. But he didn't even try. Far from reassuring Darling that he was open to all kinds of ideas about currency, for example, Salmond stuck to his idea that Scotland will keep the pound, an idea that Darling was able to ridicule. I'd have liked Salmond to have asked Darling what his own Plan B would look like, if Scotland did vote \"yes\". Daring would, after all, be on board, wouldn't he, if that was what his country wanted from him? Instead, Salmond just insisted that no Plan B would ever be needed, which anyone can see is terribly optimistic. But the fact is that undecided voters are indeed cautious, unwilling to take the romantic leap of faith that Salmond made long ago. Undecided voters need reassurance, not for their worries to be sneered at or bulldozed aside. In reacting that way to Darling's worries, Salmond did the same to those of the voters that he needs. Unless Salmond, in the next six weeks, can offer more than fingers-crossed bluster to those who fear the unknown, he's not going to win any more hearts and minds than he's already bagged. He may even lose a few. Fraser MacDonald: 'The he-said, she-said stuff is of interest to no-one outside campaign insiders' Nobody won but the audience probably lost. What started out as a serious-minded debate between two political titans veered into rapid-fire shouty set pieces, a symptom of the long term disabling enmity between Labour and the SNP. Salmond and Darling are accomplished speakers and both had occasional moments of clarity and substance. But the he-said, she-said stuff is of interest to no-one outside campaign insiders. And the dreaded stock phrases. \"Best of both worlds\" could not sound more hollow after the worst recession in a century. Better Together will doubtless be content with Darling's performance. Such was the carefully handspun safety net of low expectation, you'd almost think Darling was what the SNP might call an \"ordinary\" person rather than a career politician with five cabinet posts. But the big surprise was his emotional pitch. I expected him to present the sedative monotone of Unionist reason, but he seemed at times like he was giving a speech to the CBI both at speed and on speed. I pitied the stenographer. \"The financial markets are listening to this\" wasn't Darling's most inspiring line, but Salmond's belligerence over a currency plan B will probably linger. Salmond never quite conquered his signature rhetorical ticks \u2013 the knowing smirk, the theatrical incredulity \u2013 but at least he delivered the closing line like he meant it. The relentless emphasis on the short-term mechanics of independence \u2013 the currency fetish \u2013 is depressingly narrow. Happily, the real debate happening on doorsteps and workplaces is smarter and funnier than this. John McTernan: 'All Darling had to do was to avoid tripping over his laces' It was Salmond's to lose \u2013 and he went on and did just that. The great debate was lively and sparky. The format worked to good effect \u2013 but it ended up entirely to Darling's benefits for three reasons. First, it is always best in a televised debate to enter as the underdog. Salmond's supporters overdid the pre-match bragging. Pete Wishart, an SNP MP, claimed that the debate would be \"a slaughter worse than the Bannockburn re-enactment\" (presumably he meant the actual bloody battle.) In one sense, all Alistair had to do was to avoid tripping over his laces and he would have come out ahead, so wild were the predictions of a blood bath. But he did more, he reminded viewers that he is a gifted politician \u2013 no-one gets to be chancellor by chance. And one who can give as good as he gets. Second, Salmond stuck to what he knows best. His tried, tested and focus-grouped lines. But they came under pressure in the debate. And he reacted as he always does \u2013 with snide personal attacks. These went down like a cup of cold sick with the audience. Finally, the debate was held on Darling's grounds. Don't Knows are most concerned about getting specific factual questions on the currency and the EU. Salmond was downright evasive here. Darling's sharpest blow was when he asked Salmond to imagine he might be wrong. He was highlighting what is one of Alex's greatest weaknesses in the groups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
