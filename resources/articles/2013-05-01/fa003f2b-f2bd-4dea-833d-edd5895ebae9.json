Smith, 71, who recently announced her retirement from broadcasting after 40 years as one of the UK's leading TV chefs and has launched an online cookery school, said one of the reasons for starting the new venture was that \"nobody teaches people how to cook any more\". She also has harsh words for modern cookery shows in an interview in the latest issue of Radio Times, published on Tuesday, saying they presented food as theatre instead of teaching the basics. Asked by the listings magazine whether she worried that shows such as MasterChef intimidated rather than inspired, Smith said: \"Yes, I would never be a judge on that. They used to ask me but I could never criticise people: my job is to make them feel they can do it.\" She added that the standard of cooking in Britain had declined since her first BBC show in 1973. \"We've lost our grip on home cooking. I can see that by the way kitchen equipment shops are in decline,\" Smith said. \"There are a lot of shortcuts but the main problem is that people are afraid to cook.\" Smith was criticised for her last major series, 2008's How To Cheat at Cooking \u2013 an update on her first cookery book, published in 1971 \u2013 because its recipes included \"pre-prepared\" food. But she said one of her ambitions for her internet venture, Delia Online, was to help young people and families. \"Nobody teaches people how to cook any more \u2026 you can't just open a book, go into a kitchen; you've got to have some lessons,\" Smith added. \"Everybody now knows about food from around the world and what chefs do; but not everybody knows how to make an omelette. What is missing is the basics. There's where I come in, you see; that's what I want to try and do: fill that gap.\" Smith criticised modern cookery shows, saying they seemed to need to embellish food and \"wrap it up in all kinds of things \u2026 food isn't theatre and to make it into theatre is wrong,\" she added. \"It can speak for itself and it's wonderful and it's beautiful and it's art \u2013 it's everything.\" She admitted to having a soft spot for BBC2's Hairy Bikers, David Myers and Simon King, who she said made cooking funny but also made viewers think they would like to make the dishes they cooked. Smith, who with her husband is joint majority shareholder in Premier League football team Norwich FC, said she would not be going back on her decision to retire from TV cookery but, if the BBC requested it, she would be willing to sell her online teaching courses to be broadcast in a five-minute slot. Whether or not Smith is correct in her assessment, Britain is buying recipe books in large numbers. Total UK sales of food and drinks books (excluding ebooks) grew from just under 7.5m in 2008 to 8.7m last year, although this is slightly below 2011's peak. Jamie Oliver's Jamie's 30 Minute Meals has sold more than 1.79m copies since its release in 2010 and remains the fasting-selling non-fiction title in UK book publishing history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
