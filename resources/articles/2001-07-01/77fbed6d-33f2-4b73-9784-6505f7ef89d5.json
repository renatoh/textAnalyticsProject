A full-sized orchestra, playing on modern instruments, it performs, broadly speaking, like a period instrument band. And these techniques aren't just applied to the sort of 18th and 19th century music that is usually given the \"authentic\" treatment. This Prom, the orchestra's first under Norrington, featured a work premiered as recently as 1922: Vaughan Williams's Symphony No 3. This pared-down approach - light playing, fleet tempos, minimal vibrato - is de rigueur for Weber's Oberon overture, written in 1826, and the piece sounded duly magical in places, despite the odd lapse in ensemble in the violins. But it was much more of a surprise to hear the Vaughan Williams played in this way. Although the work is called the Pastoral Symphony, it's really an elegiac piece written in the aftermath of war, and has more to do with the landscape around the trenches of northern France than with the folksy scenes that lead some to snipe at English \"cowpat\" music. Usually, modern orchestral players strive for a rich, full-bodied sound at the high points of a piece like this, but here the climaxes had a different kind of intensity. The composer's shifting sonorities, often created by pairing different combinations of wind and string soloists, were clearly audible, and Norrington brought to the work a satisfying sense of structure. But perhaps Vaughan Williams did intend one or two moments to generate their own white heat. And without modern performance techniques, this seemed just out of the orchestra's reach. It was back to 1826 for Schubert's Ninth Symphony, the \"Great\". This is a very long work, but Norrington is one of the fastest conductors in the business. This wasn't the only reason for it flying by: Norrington seemed relaxed, even nonchalant, yet under his direction details sprang from this masterpiece. Surging crescendos - the timpani deliberately reaching their peak just slightly after the rest - gave subtle yet exhilarating momentum to the first movement. The second started off jokily, with behind-you bass interjections and the timpanist making us jump, but gathered, straight-faced, to a climactic m l\u00e9e, with nothing held back except the vibrato. There was no lack of intensity here. In Schubert, at least, it seems that Norrington's approach works Royal Albert Hall Related articles: 24.07.2001: Prom 3 21.07.2001: First night of the Proms 18.07.2001: Proms 2001 goes global with live webcasts 13.07.2001: Two months in the country 13.07.2001: Heart strings"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
