Other than the one City match in which he was personally involved, which his team lost 3-1 at the Etihad in March, he has not seen them play. Capoue, Watford\u2019s player of the season, has said there is \u201cno way\u201d he would watch even a cup final on TV, preferring to watch basketball or spend time with his children. \u201cI love football, I am passionate about it, but there is not only football in life,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really watch it on TV. The highlights are always on at the training ground but I will not be focused on a particular game. I\u2019ll watch every [NBA] play-off and I try to get out there [to the US] every year. I am very passionate about basketball.\u201d When the Frenchman finds himself with a free Saturday during the football season, he has no difficulty ignoring the game altogether. \u201cI\u2019ll spend a normal day with my wife and kids and try to learn something outside football,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cI try to do a lot of activities. I don\u2019t know what I will do after football but if I am too focused on football it would not be smart. It\u2019s good to get a lot of information about other aspects of life.\u201d Capoue, 6ft 2in and who has children aged five, four and one, watches NBA highlights if they wake him early in the morning, and might have gone into basketball full-time only for his family to change his mind. \u201cThe family said: \u2018Come on, football, please,\u2019 he said. \u201cMy cousin was a professional footballer so knew about the world of football and the family said it was crazy not to go. I had the ability to do both, but at the end of the basketball sessions I realised I just wanted to play football with the balls, so I thought: \u2018OK, football it is.\u2019 My friends still play basketball, so when I go home I play with them. It\u2019s nice to get those basketball boots on again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
