I don\u2019t want to become Nick Clegg, I hear you protest. The idea is not only repellent but ridiculous. Facebook won\u2019t offer me \u00a31m-plus a year and a Silicon Valley mansion if I sell out. I agree that it won\u2019t. But opting out is far more common than selling out and Clegg is the market leader in both. I called him in October 2018 to check a point in a piece I was writing. I should have paid more attention to the note of alarm when he realised that a journalist was on the phone. He told me he was in Sheffield. Ah, I said, you are preparing to fight Sheffield Hallam again. He lost the seat to a mentally troubled Labour candidate, who poured out levels of abuse against women, gay people and his own constituents that were too much even for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party. Clegg could have retaken the constituency with ease and gone back to Westminster to champion the Remain cause. He almost laughed at my quaint suggestion. No, he wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to politics. Two days later, I learned why when news broke of his new career. Technology specialists can describe the awfulness of a Liberal Democrat accepting the position of vice-president at a rapacious wannabe monopoly that has facilitated the corruption of liberal democracy by Putin and the super-rich and allowed the mass murder of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Muslims to be incited on its site. I am struck by Clegg\u2019s decision to walk away from the gravest political crisis of his life. Because the Labour leadership failed to oppose Brexit, the \u201cminor\u201d parties increased in significance, as did politicians such as Clegg and Tony Blair, whose sell-by date seemed long passed. Say what you liked about them, but at least they were fighting back. Clegg said Brexit was a battle that had to be won, then fled the field as the struggle began. The same temptation in a different form diverts people who see themselves as committed activists. If they but realised it, they would understand that they too are opting out of necessary fights and making a nonsense of their professed principles. They say Brexit is a calamity, but their behaviour shows they don\u2019t believe it. They say they oppose an archaic first-past-the-post system that forces the public to choose between two discredited parties. But they do nothing to overcome its biases. Rob Ford, Manchester University\u2019s professor of political science, ran the numbers for me. First past the post is a \u201cnon-linear\u201d system or, as others might put it, a dazzlingly stupid way to organise a modern democracy. The Liberal Democrats could get 18% of the vote and be stuck with the 12 MPs they have now. They could get 23% and see that number rise to a mere 20 MPs. But hit 25% and they win 100 or more seats, with even more as the vote heads towards 30%, on condition that the Remain camp doesn\u2019t destroy itself. It makes no sense for the Lib Dems to fight the Greens. The Green vote is concentrated in Brighton, Norwich and parts of London and Manchester where the Liberal Democrats are weak. If the pattern of continental politics is repeated, and one of the paradoxes of Brexit is that it is making Britain resemble the rest of Europe, the Greens will fight Labour in the cosmopolitan cities, as they fight the socialists and social democrats in France and Germany, and the Liberal Democrats will fight the Tories in the shires. Explain the need for Remainer co-operation and activists shudder. They prefer the purity of failure to the compromises that breaking out of our decaying system entails. I am sure they think of themselves as his moral superiors, but they are not so different to Clegg. Ed Davey is running for leader of the Lib Dems on a sectarian ticket. He won\u2019t contemplate a Remain alliance. \u201cA pact doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d he told the Observer and anyone who says otherwise is \u201cselling the Liberal Democrats short\u201d. Green leaders say they are more open-minded, but add that their activists hate the idea of deals with MPs who worked with the Conservatives. The protests become louder as co-operation with Welsh and Scottish nationalists is discussed. For how can unionists work with separatists? As the triumphs of Boris Johnson and Corbyn are teaching us, activists are cursed by tribalism and an overweening vanity that makes them believe the country must want what they want. Can they break out of their silos and understand the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s line: \u201cWe must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately\u201d? If they do not, another future beckons for England. A hard Brexit leads to a country divided between an ugly nationalist right and an abusive hard left. If they see no way of breaking through, voters who oppose both will give up. I saw apathy set in during the 18 years of Conservative rule from 1979 to 1997. People who were full of fight were worn down by four election defeats. I see it now when I visit liberals in the authoritarian states of Hungary and the Czech Republic. They can protest occasionally and laugh at edgy comedians, but the knowledge that their protests can never hurt those in power weighs them down. Millions are now bouncing between parties, looking for leaders who can provide a credible opposition. If they can\u2019t find them, they will retreat into private life and do their best to ignore Brexit Britain. If the choice continues to be between Johnson and Corbyn, they will suffer the worst fate of all: they will opt out and become Nick Clegg \u2013 but without the money. They will carry on opting out until our spluttering politics finally manages to cough up an alternative that works. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
