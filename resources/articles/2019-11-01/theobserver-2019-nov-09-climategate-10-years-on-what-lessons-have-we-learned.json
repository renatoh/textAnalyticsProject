Do it today. It is truly the greatest contribution to mankind that you will ever make.\u201d Nor was it very different from the other emails that were arriving in Jones\u2019s inbox. Others described the climate scientist as the scum of the earth. Some authors promised to kill him themselves. Most of the messages were riddled with obscenities. All made troubling reading. As to the cause of this outpouring of hatred, that was straightforward. Jones headed the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climate Research Unit, from which a tranche of emails had just been hacked and made public. These, it was claimed, showed that he and fellow researchers were faking the evidence that suggested our planet was heating up dangerously. The affair was dubbed Climategate by those who deny the existence of global warming and it remains one of modern society\u2019s most troubling affairs. Many observers believe it helped delay measures that might have slowed climate change and given humanity more time to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, its key cause. Climategate marks its 10th anniversary this month \u2013 an opportune moment to reflect on just how serious was its impact on society, and to look at the effect it had on those who were trying to stop Earth from being ravaged by rising seas, spreading deserts, disappearing coral reefs and suffocating heat. At the time, climate-change deniers were desperate to find ways to undermine the idea that global warming was real, and as Jones\u2019s unit had provided key data that supported this notion \u2013 by showing how land temperatures on Earth had been rising sharply in recent decades \u2013 his work was considered fair game. So they responded gleefully by ransacking his hacked emails for signs he may have been fiddling results and asserted, in blogs, they had found telltale signs. These claims were then picked up by media outlets hostile to global warming. \u201cScientist in climate cover-up told to quit\u201d ran one headline. \u201cScientists broke law by hiding climate data\u201d, claimed another. Jones was vilified. \u201cWithin a day or two reporters were outside my house, knocking on my neighbours\u2019 doors, digging for dirt,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI got hundreds of abusive and threatening emails. I knew the accusations were nonsense. But as someone used to being in control I buckled at the loss of it. My health deteriorated. I found it difficult to sleep and eat. I was under intense, spiralling pressure and felt I was falling to pieces. Looking back I suppose I was having some kind of a nervous breakdown.\u201d So what had Jones said in his emails to trigger these attacks? In one message Jones says he would be emailing a journal \u201cto tell them I\u2019m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor\u201d. This was interpreted as being a bid to suppress academic criticism. \u201cWe\u2019re choosing the periods to show warming,\u201d he says in another email that seems to suggest he was fiddling his data. And then there was his remark that he was going to employ \u201cMike\u2019s trick\u201d to use data that would \u201chide the decline\u201d. In other words, he was going to cover up data that showed the world was really cooling and was not warming, it was claimed. The Mike in question was Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, who had worked with Jones for years. His \u201ctrick\u201d was no more than a simple technique to combine the records of temperatures measured directly by thermometer with estimates made from tree rings (which roughly reflect temperature variations). \u201cIn fact, the email was an entirely innocent and appropriate conversation between scientists,\u201d Mann states in this week\u2019s BBC Four documentary, Climategate: Science of a Scandal. He and Jones were merely trying to find appropriate ways of illustrating a graph of global temperature changes. This view was not shared by Sarah Palin: the former US vice-presidential candidate wrote a Washington Post op-ed article that claimed the emails \u201creveal that leading climate \u2018experts\u2019 \u2026 manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures\u201d. Subsequent investigations by journalists showed these claims were unsupportable, however. Guardian writer Fred Pearce studied the leaked emails and produced a book, The Climate Files, from his research. \u201cHave the Climategate revelations undermined the case that we are experiencing made-made climate change? Absolutely not,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cNothing uncovered in the emails destroys the argument that humans are warming the planet.\u201d Pearce was writing for the eco-friendly Guardian, but his views were supported by many others, such as Mike Hanlon, former science editor of the Daily Mail. \u201cScratch and sniff as we did, there was no smoking gun, no line that would show that there had been a conspiracy to fabricate a great untruth,\u201d he said later. Thus, from the Guardian to the Daily Mail, the notion that Climategate represented \u201cthe worst scientific scandal of a generation\u201d \u2013 as one UK newspaper had claimed \u2013 was found in the end to be unsupportable. This point is emphasised by Fiona Fox, head of the UK\u2019s Science Media Centre. \u201cBritish climate science was subjected to huge scrutiny by the world\u2019s best journalists and it stood up to the test. If you look at where we are now in terms of public trust in climate science, it\u2019s hard to sustain the argument that Climategate was fatally damaging to the field. \u201cClimategate also tells us that front page rows about science are an opportunity as well as a threat and the scientists who stood up in that febrile environment and soundly defended science also did a great job. We need to remember that.\u201d Several official UK reports on the affair also supported Jones. One inquiry \u2013 by Sir Muir Russell, a senior civil servant \u2013 specifically praised the \u201crigour and honesty\u201d of Jones and his colleagues while another, chaired by Lord Oxburgh, found \u201cno evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice\u201d. The only real criticism was the suggestion that the researchers had not always shown a \u201cproper sense of openness\u201d in dealing with data inquires. Jones and colleagues were also backed by the US Environmental Protection Agency which heavily criticised American politicians and energy groups who had tried to use the leaked emails to dismiss the risks facing our overheating world. These individuals had \u201croutinely misunderstood or mis-characterised the scientific issues, drawn faulty conclusions, resorted to hyperbole, impugned the ethics of climate scientists in general and characterised actions as \u2018falsifications\u2019 and \u2018manipulation\u2019 with no basis or support,\u201d said the agency. Other powerful support was provided by physicists at University of California, Berkeley, who decided to test if deniers had been right to question Jones\u2019s temperature charts. Led by Professor Richard Muller and backed by funds that included a $150,000 grant from noted climate-crisis denial supporters, the Charles Koch Foundation \u2013 the team re-analysed more than 1.6bn land temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s \u2013 and came to exactly the same conclusions as Jones: the fairly level temperatures that had continued through the past few centuries began to spike sharply a few decades ago as atmosphere carbon levels rose. \u201cOur biggest surprise was that the new results agreed so closely with warming values published previously,\u201d said Muller. \u201cThis confirms these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate-change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions.\u201d Such powerful endorsements might have been expected to end deniers\u2019 claims about Climategate. However, they have continued since 2009 to accuse Jones and others of collusion and fraud. Former Times columnist and climate contrarian Matt Ridley is typical. The \u201cscandal\u201d showed scientists were \u201cconspiring to ostracise sceptics, delete emails, game peer review and manipulate the presentation of data\u201d, he wrote in 2017, ignoring the many reports and studies that in the interim have shown this was not the case. Note also that since Climategate we have had eight of the warmest years on record; carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise inexorably; and Arctic sea ice levels in summer have reached record lows over the past decade. Occurrences of heavy rainfall and heatwaves have also increased dramatically. The world has continued to heat up dangerously. Yet humanity has done very little to tackle the crisis. And that raises a critical question: did Climategate play a role in this failure to act? Some observers believe it did and, as an illustration, point to the fate of the Copenhagen climate summit \u2013 organised under the UN framework convention on climate change \u2013 which took place only a few weeks after the leaking of the CRU\u2019s emails. The Copenhagen summit is widely regarded as a failure. Instead of agreeing on a legally binding treaty to limit carbon emissions as hoped, delegates chose merely to \u201ctake note of\u201d an accord drawn up by a core group of heads of state. So did the leaking of the Climategate emails have a pernicious influence there? Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, doubts it. \u201cEssentially the conference was badly managed. Climategate had very little impact.\u201d On the other hand, says Ward, climategate did damage public policy-making in the UK and in other western countries. \u201cRightwing politicians, allied with fossil fuel companies, used their influence to spread false claims about the emails and to argue against policies to cut fossil fuel use. That propaganda campaign still continues today.\u201d The use of illegally hacked emails in Climategate also shows deniers will resort to all sorts of underhand methods to confuse the public, Ward added. \u201cI am sure they would do the same again today \u2013 so scientists are going to have to remain vigilant and be ready to fight back at any time.\u201d This point is backed by Mann, who has fought vociferously to defend climate science in the US. Although the past few years have seen a significant growth in the public\u2019s belief that the world is heating dangerously, climate-change denial has not gone away. \u201cHard denial has evolved into something more pernicious,\u201d he says. \u201cAttention has been deflected from imposing policy solutions towards stressing that changes should be made in individual behaviour \u2013 people\u2019s diet, methods of travel and other lifestyle choices. It is a classic industry manoeuvre: put the onus on individuals to change things and ignore the need to impose systemic solutions and make policy reforms. \u201cOf course, individual action needs to be part of the battle, but not as a substitute for policy reform. It should be as an additional component. We must also be aware how the forces of denial are exploiting the lifestyle change movement to get supporters of action against climate change to argue with each other and engage in behavioural shaming. So yes, we will be vigilant in future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
