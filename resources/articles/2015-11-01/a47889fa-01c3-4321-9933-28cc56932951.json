His conviction for cruelty of an inmate carried jail time of up to three years. But significantly shorter jail time was not the only way Chatham County superior court judge James Bass issued a more lenient sentence: he also allowed the former deputy to serve his time on the weekends. While experts say weekend-only jail sentences are not unheard of, they are not common, either. In fact, some say they would like to see those sentences used more often \u2013 for defendants who aren\u2019t members of law enforcement. \u201cIt is the type of creative sentence that in one sense seems a great reform move because it allows people to serve time while keeping their jobs, thus promoting re-entry and life stability,\u201d said Andrea Roth, an assistant professor at the UC Berkeley school of law. A similar remedy sees inmates allowed to serve time in a halfway house and attend work during the day, she said. Roth, who is an expert in criminal law, said the weekend sentence is typically used for defendants who hold down a job that a judge finds \u201csocially valuable\u201d or when the individual is the \u201cbreadwinner for the family\u201d. \u201cOne would hope, however, that all defendants, and not just sheriff\u2019s deputies, would get the benefit of such creative sentencing practices,\u201d she said. Last month, former Chatham County sheriff\u2019s deputies Jason Kenny and Maxine Evans were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the January death of 21-year-old Matthew Ajibade, a former Savannah College of Art and Design student. Though the manslaughter charge was dismissed, Kenny was found guilty of cruelty to an inmate, a felony. Ajibade was taken into custody on domestic violence charges the evening of 1 January following an altercation with his girlfriend. His family has said Ajibade was having a manic bipolar disorder episode. As deputies attempted to book him, Ajibade became \u201ccombative\u201d and started a fight, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. A video later released showed Kenny shocked Ajibade four times with a Taser, while the Nigerian man\u2019s hands and feet were shackled. A local coroner ruled the student\u2019s death a homicide by blunt force trauma. Kenny and eight other deputies were fired after the incident. Another ex-deputy, Maxine Evans, received six years\u2019 probation for providing false grand jury testimony, along with a $1,000 fine and 350 hours\u2019 community service. A jail nurse, Gregory Brown, was found guilty of making false statements to investigators and received three years\u2019 probation. Kenny\u2019s sentence to serve successive weekends is known as \u201cintermittent sentencing\u201d. Proponents of criminal justice reform point to the punishment as a way to offer courts \u201cgreater flexibility\u201d to devise a punishment that matches a particular crime, said Paul Heaton, senior fellow and academic director at the Quattrone Center for the Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s law school. Most states have statutes that allow for convicts to receive that type of punishment under certain circumstances, he added. \u201cMoreover, structuring a sentence this way can, in some cases, allow an offender to avoid negative collateral consequences (e.g., loss of employment, disrupted family relationships) that are not necessarily the intent of a particular sentence, but which might otherwise occur following a traditional sentence,\u201d Heaton said in an email. Heaton said he hasn\u2019t seen \u201cgreat\u201d statistics on intermittent sentencing in the US, and that it is more common outside the US. It has, for example, been used in cases related to financial fraud and sexual abuse by Catholic priests. \u201cIt happens now and again, especially to preserve employment,\u201d said Stephanos Bibas, a professor of law and criminologyalso at Penn Law. \u201cMaybe it should be more widespread. Cops sometimes get favored treatment, but the remedy might not be to abolish their deal, but to give it to others.\u201d In a statement provided to reporters through the family\u2019s attorney, Ajibade\u2019s cousin, Chris Oladapo, said: \u201cWhatever sentence is handed here today makes no difference. These three people are just pawns, and those in leadership most culpable will be left unpunished.\u201d The office of Mark O\u2019Mara, the family\u2019s attorney, told the Guardian it is still considering a civil suit in the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
