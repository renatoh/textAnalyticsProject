Everything on that laptop has been lost. I still have all my music on the iPod, but cannot work out how to transfer it back to the Mac. Svetlana Kirov JS: Apple has a support document, Copying iTunes Store purchases from your iPod or iPhone to a computer (http://bit.ly/aj0152), which explains the process. Briefly, when your iPod's icon appears in iTunes, you can choose Transfer Purchases from iPod from the File menu. Otherwise, a lot of iPod utilities allow you to copy files across, including Ollie's iPod Extractor 5.1 (http://bit.ly/aj0153), which is free. AVG v Roxio When I tried to download AVG 8.5 it said I needed to update my Roxio Easy CD Creator. The latest version is $99, which I am unwilling to spend as I rarely use it. Is there any free software you would recommend for burning CDs/DVDs? Colin Johnson JS: The clash with AVG software has often been discussed on the Roxio forums, and apparently Roxio fixed it \"years ago\". If you go to the Roxio software update page (http://bit.ly/aj0154) then you should be able to update the Roxio drivers. However, as you ask, CDBurnerXP (cdburnerxp.se) is a good free Windows program that can burn CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray BDs. Second hard drives Do you have any views on the best use of a second physical hard drive with Windows? I use video editing software, which generally says that a second hard drive is fairly important. William Hudson JS: I think the days of the second hard drive have gone, for most users. They were handy for backups when drives were smaller, and they're still useful for video rendering, where there's an advantage to having a big open space to write to. But cheap USB hard drives and network drives are now more useful options, and much easier to install. PC grinding noises Why does my PC makes a grinding sound on boot up? It is worse in cold weather or when the PC has not been on for a week. It stops after a minute or so. Chris Myers JS: Grinding noises are always bad news, but the most common cause is a failing fan, and that's what it sounds like. Your PC may have several fans to cool the processor, a fast graphics card, the case and the power supply (PSU). You will probably need to open the case and listen to find out which fan it is. Replacements are available but if the culprit is the PSU fan, you may need to replace the whole PSU. If the noise is coming from the hard drive, make sure your work is backed up because it may be starting to fail. It may be possible to free up a fan with a tiny drop of oil (but don't use WD-40). Dan's Data has a page on fan maintenance that will help. A UK company offers a lubricant called FanLube, but I have no idea if this makes any difference. Card swapping I have a Fuji digital camera with an xD card, and a Panasonic TV set with an SD slot for showing pictures. I cannot seem to get an adaptor. P Daniel JS: The xD (eXtreme Digital) card was introduced in 2002, two years after SD (Secure Digital), and is proprietary to Fuji and Olympus. There are now four different xD formats, storage is limited, and the cards are expensive. In contrast, the SD card offers more memory for less money and is used by hundreds of companies. Unless a reader knows of an adaptor, your best bet is probably to buy an all-in-one card reader such as the ABC and copy your photos from the camera's xD card to an SD card. Image manipulation Some years ago, I used to use Corel Draw to manipulate images, including scanned JPEG files. Is there a free download or an economical package I could use now? Howard Shaw JS: CorelDraw is a vector graphics editor, and version 14 came out last year. If that's what you want, have a look at Inkscape and Creative Docs: both are free. If you want to do image manipulation, you might be better off with Paint.net. There are also free examples of Serif Software's DrawPlus and PhotoPlus. Backchat \u2022 Vicki Eves wanted to synchronise two PCs in different places. Martin Saunders and Rex Last recommended SyncToy 2.0, a free Microsoft utility. \"You just set it up and it synchronises quickly with two mouse clicks,\" added Rex. On the Ask Jack blog, two people tipped Windows Live Sync. Neil Skinner suggested Dropbox ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
