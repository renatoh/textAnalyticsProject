However, the future exploitation of oil reserves in the Gulf will risk a recurrence. On 6 January 1862, at Hartley in Northumberland, one of the worst disasters in the history of mining in the UK resulted in the loss of 220 lives. As a consequence, regulations were made that required any deep pit to have at least two shafts before coal could be extracted. If new oil wells are to be sunk at huge depths under the sea, it should be a requirement that a second bore, or relief well, is drilled before oil is extracted. Then, should the seal on the production bore fail, as in the recent case, the second bore can be activated promptly to effectively seal the well and prevent the uncontrolled release of crude oil.
