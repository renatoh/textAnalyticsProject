Not that local supporters of the foreign secretary are resigned to a mugshot of Boris Johnson inevitably replacing May\u2019s photo when the dust settles on the Tory leadership race. \u201cWe keep telling him that it doesn\u2019t matter if everyone sees your soft side. Let it show,\u201d said Denise Le Gal, the chairman of South West Surrey Conservative association. A longtime friend, she rejects the caricature of Hunt as a bland technocratic \u201cTheresa May in trousers\u201d. \u201cThis is by no means over and I certainly wouldn\u2019t underestimate him because, while we all might think Boris is an amusing guy, we have some very tough negotiations over Brexit coming and I think people would rather a businessman than a journalist doing it. I think what [Hunt] needs to do is convince the membership of that.\u201d Hunt\u2019s constituency of South West Surrey is home to one of the country\u2019s larger concentrations of Tory members \u2013 the 993rd, who joined on Friday morning, was advised that voting for the leader was only open to those with three months under their belts. The Johnson juggernaut will roll into the area for hustings scheduled for next month. Among non-members the Guardian spoke to, the race tended to be viewed with a bemused detachment. At a National Trust cafe beside the Devil\u2019s Punch Bowl \u2013 a natural amphitheatre created, according to legend, by an epic battle between two giants \u2013 Vanessa Mason rolled her eyes at the mention of Johnson\u2019s name. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an entertainer. We need someone who is straightforward although quite frankly we liked Theresa. She got a rotten deal and basically ended up as the fall guy,\u201d said the pensioner, a lifelong Conservative voter. Not that Hunt or anyone else had impressed her in the recent debates. \u201cI watched but no one stood out. Rory Stewart just came across as young and ineffectual.\u201d Nodding her head in agreement, her friend Eve Carr added with a shrug: \u201cI always vote Conservative and Hunt\u2019s all right I suppose \u2026 but we could do better.\u201d The level of enthusiasm remained low on the high street in the nearby town of Haslemere, where the elimination of Sajid Javid was mourned by Shirley Whittall, a Tory party member. \u201cI think Boris is a bit iffy to be be honest,\u201d said the 85-year-old, who became a member after moving to Britain in the 1960s. \u201cThen again \u2026 can you really know what any of them are like?\u201d Voters in South West Surrey \u2013 who went 52.95% for remain in the EU referendum \u2013 might have been cool on Hunt\u2019s opponent, it was of a different order among members of the public 311 miles to the north in another solidly Conservative seat, Ribble Valley (56.4% leave). The view from \u2018Brexit Valley\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind. It\u2019s Boris every time for me,\u201d said Patricia Counsell, 64, a trader at Clitheroe Market. \u201cHe\u2019s always straight to the point and tells it absolutely as it is. People in Lancashire like that in a leader. Ask Boris a question and he\u2019ll give you a proper answer. He\u2019s not bothered if it gets him in trouble.\u201d Her friend Ann Simpson, 64, agreed with Counsell\u2019s assessment of the last two Tory candidates standing \u2013 and that Hunt was \u201ca remainer, for a start\u201d. \u201cBoris is his own man, I think, and Hunt is just Theresa May in trousers. She was a waste of space, and he is too,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople around here will get behind Boris, no question. They see the Ribble Valley as Brexit Valley \u2013 and they\u2019re proud to be that way.\u201d Malcolm Goldsworth, 66, the captain at the town\u2019s golf club, was more measured in his approval of Johnson as the leading contender for Downing Street. \u201cNot everything he says is right, but at least he has a point of view and he\u2019s direct. When he\u2019s finished speaking, you know where you stand,\u201d said the retired police officer. \u201cLancashire voted solidly for Brexit and he\u2019s been very strong on it from the start. He\u2019s not bothered about who he offends. My view is that we voted out; let\u2019s just finally get out.\u201d \u2018I wonder if Johnson is quite a scary number\u2019 Back on the sunny streets of Haslemere meanwhile, some of the most clearly expressed points of admiration for Hunt came from Isabelle Cole, who said she had always believed his skills might one day propel him into Downing Street. But there was a catch: \u201cI personally was really rooting for Rory Stewart, but then I\u2019m a Liberal Democrat and was recently elected a councillor.\u201d Looking on at her Tory neighbours, she also suggested that southern Conservatives in places such as Surrey might well still balk when it comes to giving the keys of No 10 to Johnson. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to caricature but nobody here is an out and out redneck Tory. They\u2019re quite mid-blue around here. When it comes to it, I wonder if Johnson is quite a scary number for a lot of Tories who like to tread carefully and hedge their bets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
