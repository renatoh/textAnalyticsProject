Alongside a gripping plot centred on murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer and Lynchian weirdness such as the red room, the series will always be remembered for its style. Catherine Spooner, professor of literature and culture at Lancaster University, and co-editor of Twin Peaks: New Approaches to Materiality, Theory and Genre on Television, says: \u201cVirtually every character wears a kind of uniform conveying their role in the community.\u201d Here are six characters who use fashion to particularly memorable effect. With Kyle MacLachlan, aka Agent Cooper, hosting a virtual viewing party, here is some inspiration if you want to celebrate the anniversary in style. Contains spoilers \u2026 Audrey Horne The 18-year-old daughter of businessman Benjamin Horne, Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn) dresses to please herself. First seen in a demure sweater and pleated kilt, she changes from brogues to scarlet stilettos when she leaves her father\u2019s car and arrives at school, a scene Spooner describes as an \u201cintensely personal moment of autoeroticism\u201d. This exploration continues, spelled out in clothes, as she and Agent Cooper get closer. We see Audrey in more sweaters, more kilts, in lingerie and \u2013 in the infamous cherry stalk scene \u2013 in an off-the-shoulder Little Black Dress. Her seductive dance in a kilt in the Double R diner, which contrasts Audrey with the distinctly ordinary fleece-clad Donna, is now a cult reference. It was reprised, with Fenn in black lace, for Twin Peaks: The Return in 2017. Thirty years on, Audrey Horne is still feeling herself. Nadine Hurley Spooner describes Nadine as an example of how the show up-ends our idea of a uniform as something that \u201cshould normally comfort us by showing everyone in their right place\u201d. In Twin Peaks \u201cthey tend to disconcert us because there is something \u2018off\u2019 about them.\u201d Indeed, a 35-year-old woman combining a cheerleader\u2019s outfit with an eyepatch and wild hair is a through-the-looking-glass idea of an Americana icon, representing Nadine\u2019s regression to her teenage self after a suicide attempt. If Nadine has spawned many Halloween costumes, her signature look has also gained relevance recently thanks to Cheer, the Netflix documentary about Navarro College\u2019s cheerleading squad. It\u2019s safe to say that when it comes to style, Nadine has made mat. The Log Lady If Lynch hadn\u2019t made up the Log Lady, she might have appeared on Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci catwalk anyway. Played by the director\u2019s friend, Catherine Coulson, her outfit of a 70s-style cardigan, shirt, poloneck and oversized glasses has a retro geek chic feel that is now a familiar aesthetic. It was also the mood music around that statement log, reportedly valued at $275,000. Coulson\u2019s character has since been celebrated as a patron saint of outsiders who are willing to live \u2013 and dress \u2013 as they please. The actor once described her character as \u201cthe most normal person on the show\u201d and when Bravo showed repeats of Twin Peaks in 1993, the Log Lady introduced each episode. Lynch described her as the \u201chostess with the mostess [sic]\u201d. The Log Lady\u2019s legendary status was sealed with 2017\u2019s The Return. While Coulson died in 2015, she stars in a moving posthumous performance, wearing those glasses with the breathing apparatus required to treat her cancer. James Hurley In 2017, Vice called James Hurley both \u201cthe worst thing about Twin Peaks\u201d and \u201cthe original sad lad\u201d. Hurley is clearly meant to be a walking cliche, a cypher of American masculine teenage rebellion: you can tell because he wears a biker jacket and shades, and drives a motorcycle. Spooner points to Hurley\u2019s biker jacket as an item that operates symbolically. Like his name, and his serenading of fellow teens, it\u2019s an item that puts him in the same lineage as James Dean and Chris Isaak, while signposting gently that he\u2019s not really worthy of all the women \u2013 Laura Palmer, Donna, Maddy \u2013 who fall for him. Reprising his much-trolled guitar playing for the new series, the jacket was noticeably absent \u2013 perhaps because a middle-aged man wearing one might spell something different, namely a mid-life crisis. Agent Cooper Like Don Draper in Mad Men, Agent Dale Cooper is everything to Twin Peaks: hero, symbol, plot device, fashion reference. It\u2019s his voice we hear first in the series, closely followed by a shot of him hanging upside down in tartan boxers and a clean white vest. Everything about Agent Cooper\u2019s look is, as it is with Draper, clean, neat, presentable and uniform: short back and sides; crisp, fresh suit, trenchcoat. In a post-normcore world, this has been celebrated by fashion. Kyle MachLachlan, who plays Cooper, attended Balenciaga\u2019s fashion show in 2018 with the label\u2019s hyped designer Demna Gvasalia commenting that he was \u201calways on my moodboard\u201d. After The Return, in which MacLachlan plays five separate Coopers, Gvasalia\u2019s moodboard will be full up. \u201cHis performance is masterful but obviously it is immeasurably assisted by costume,\u201d says Spooner. \u201c\u2018Bad Cooper\u2019 is a particular stroke of genius \u2013 MacLachlan\u2019s oddly neat ponytail and mod-inspired leather jacket are somehow exactly what you would expect Cooper possessed by the evil spirit of Bob to wear.\u201d Diane Everyone is a little bit in love with Laura Dern right now. David Lynch was way ahead of Renata Klein fans, though. The actor\u2019s first major role was in his film Blue Velvet in 1986. While she didn\u2019t appear in the original two series, she plays Diane in The Return. Yes, that Diane, the secretary to whom Agent Cooper sends recordings throughout the series, a woman he describes as \u201can interesting cross between a saint and a cabaret singer\u201d. When we finally see Dern\u2019s Diane \u2013 and, indeed, her doppelganger \u2013 they don\u2019t disappoint. We see a razor-sharp bob, sometimes platinum, sometimes fire engine red; multicoloured fingernails and garments including a leopard jacket and emerald green pyjamas. \u201cIf the first two series were full of moments in which costume drew attention to itself, Diane\u2019s costume always draws attention to itself,\u201d says Spooner. \u201cIt also brings home how infrequently you see a middle-aged woman on screen dressed in a way that is quirky and eye-catching and unusual, yet positioned as stylish and cool, rather than \u2018eccentric\u2019 or \u2018fashionista\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
