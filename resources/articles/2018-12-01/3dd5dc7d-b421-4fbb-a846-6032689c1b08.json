Mourinho claimed his squad contains too many injury-prone players and was therefore no match for the impressive qualities of Liverpool, a remarkable admission from a United manager, as two deflected strikes from Xherdan Shaqiri sealed a merited 3-1 win for the unbeaten league leaders. Klopp described Liverpool\u2019s opening 30 minutes as among the best performances of his tenure as his team replaced Manchester City at the top with a sixth consecutive league victory. United\u2019s manager, too, was lavish in praise of Liverpool, albeit while highlighting the deficiencies in his squad, assembled at exorbitant cost and now 11 points off fourth place. \u201cThe players gave everything and, when the players give everything, I am never frustrated towards them,\u201d said Mourinho, who left Paul Pogba on the bench throughout. \u201cThey play in relation to their qualities, the same way Liverpool play in relation to their qualities. They [Liverpool] are fast, they are intense, they are aggressive, they are physical, they are objective. They play 200 miles per hour with and without the ball. I am still tired just looking at [Andy] Robertson. He makes 100-metre sprints every minute, absolutely incredible, and these are qualities. \u201c When the game was really intense in the first 20-25 minutes it was difficult for us to cope. If you tell me in the first 25 minutes we are going to lose, I would say yes, it looks so. But the moment we lost the game was the moment we didn\u2019t believe we would lose.\u201d United lost Chris Smalling to injury in the warm-up and their manager admitted his team often struggle against teams who play with intensity. \u201cWe have lots of problems related to physicality,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe have lots of players that I could consider injury prone because some of our players are always injured and it is not with me. It was before me with Mr Van Gaal and before Mr Van Gaal with David [Moyes]. If you look to that period we have lots of players who are permanently injured. When you are permanently injured, physicality is very difficult to get. \u201cRobertson, Man\u00e9, Salah, Wijnaldum, Ke\u00efta, Fabinho: they are physical players and on top of that they are good players technically. I have lot of good players technically but we don\u2019t have lots of players with that intensity, that physicality, so when the game has high levels of intensity it is difficult for us.\u201d Klopp praised the \u201coutstanding\u201d contribution of the summer signing Fabinho and said the impact of Shaqiri from the bench demonstrated the improved depth of Liverpool\u2019s squad. He claimed to have \u201cignored completely\u201d City\u2019s return to top spot before his team delivered a dominant display against United\u2019s rearguard action. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cIt was a brilliant start, one of the best performances we had since I\u2019ve been in Liverpool. For the first half-hour we were outstanding, scored only one but I don\u2019t think anyone expects four or five against this United team. \u201cHow we played was just perfect. Then for half an hour we lost the momentum of the game a bit, they scored, it was more open and I had no problem with the half-time whistle, to be honest. Not because United were demanding the game but because it was more open. \u201cWhen Fellaini is on the pitch it\u2019s never a good sign for the other team \u2013 it is always difficult for the other team to defend these high balls \u2013 but we even did that very well. We got our dominance back step by step and Shaq closed the game. That was unbelievably nice, and deserved. You need a bit of luck and both goals were deflected but you need that. The first goal \u2013 what a goal. A super pass and a super control and finish. Nearly a perfect night.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
