Photograph: ITV News/PA Screwed in the ratings by the simultaneous BBC bulletin and skewered on ITV1's new computerised satire show Headcases, Sir Trevor McDonald may be regretting his return from retirement to News At Ten (ITV1). But both caricaturists and rivals with more viewers would have to agree that News at Ten had a proper scoop on Tuesday night: Mohamed Al Fayed's revelation that he was giving up trying to prove that Dodi and Diana were murdered by the Duke of Edinburgh. Interrogation is not McDonald's strength, but that didn't matter here because this was scarcely an interview. Fayed had a speech to deliver which, ironically, given his contempt for the British legal system, most resembled an agreed statement read in court. Sir Trevor would occasionally try, but usually fail, to interrupt a monologue that wanted to be a flow but became, in every sense, a trickle. Tears visibly spilled as Fayed struggled to speak two languages foreign to him: English and defeat. The sentences were so fragmented that a teaser clip during the Liverpool v Arsenal football game turned out to have been stuck together from two earlier phrases. Strictly, a conversation in which the interviewer couldn't get his questions in and the subject couldn't get his answer out should have been a disaster. But this was extraordinary television. Very sensitive viewers might argue that Fayed was too broken and emotional for the interview to have taken place; tough journalists could object that McDonald should have got him to admit that his conspiracy theories are baloney. But neither objection is sustainable. Fayed, both psychologically and legally, needed to say this and it was enough humiliation that he did. Sadly, though, it looks as if Sir Trevor may soon himself be giving a gloomy interview about giving up. Even with this genuine exclusive trailed to 7 million viewers of an exceptionally gripping football game, News At Ten was still beaten almost two to one by the BBC."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
