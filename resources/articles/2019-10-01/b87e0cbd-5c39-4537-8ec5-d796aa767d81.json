Boris Johnson lost a third parliamentary vote intended to trigger a December general election and accused the current House of Commons of being \u201cincapable\u201d of delivering Brexit. Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of all MPs \u2013 434 votes \u2013 under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act. The result was 299 votes for and 70 against after Labour abstained. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would not agree to anything until the government\u2019s intentions became clear. He said the party would \u201cconsider carefully\u201d any legislation which \u201clocks in\u201d the date of an election. Could a snap election before Christmas still happen? Absolutely. The government is willing to work with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to get an election a different way. They will propose a bill which the smaller opposition parties have indicated they will back \u2013 as long as the Tories guarantee that Brexit doesn\u2019t happen before then. This would require a simple majority, which appears to be achievable for the government. The sticking point is the date of the election. Johnson is insisting on a 12 December poll, while the Lib Dems want one three days earlier. Corbyn appeared to suggest in parliament that his party could also back the Lib Dem plan under certain unspecified conditions. Why is Labour refusing to vote for an election? Sources close to Corbyn say they do want an election but that they have argued against another national vote because they do not trust Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn indicated that he would now consider the possibility of supporting an election after Johnson officially accepted the EU\u2019s offer of an extension to the Brexit process to 31 January. Many Labour MPs and activists fear their party could struggle in an election before Brexit happens because the party\u2019s position remains unclear. However, Corbyn loyalists argue that once the public sees the Labour leader on the campaign stump, the party will win over voters and defy the polls as they did during the 2017 election. Johnson might also suffer under pressure from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party for failing to deliver on his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October, they claim. What does all this mean for Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill? Conservative MPs and ministers are concerned that they could come under pressure if an election is held before delivering Brexit, but Downing Street is determined to press ahead with one, buoyed by internal polling. The prime minister\u2019s aides believe that only with a decent majority \u2013 rather than his current minority of 45 \u2013 will he be able to deliver his Brexit proposals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
