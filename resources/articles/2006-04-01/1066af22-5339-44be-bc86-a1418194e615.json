Well, the good news for the nation's optimists is that you're not alone - and you're not insane. Someone more mathematically minded than myself might produce a formula to predict the levels of optimism among England fans. The variables are easily defined: how recently England played; how well they performed; whether there have been at least two good performances since the last bad one; and how Michael Owen is recovering from his latest niggly injury. So in the days after the team lost to Northern Ireland last September there was a mood of terrible pessimism, because they had only just played, they'd played very badly, and Owen wasn't injured at all. But these are England's glory hours: they haven't played competitively for ages, were pretty good when they did, and Owen will definitely have recovered from his latest injury by June. Football fans are, contrary to appearances, a rational breed: they get no pleasure from believing in lost causes, but will do it if they have to. Their logic when preparing for major tournaments is simple: everything that is not impossible is, to a greater or lesser degree, likely. And it's certainly not impossible that England might win the World Cup. Supporters of Sven-Goran Eriksson's team can be more optimistic now than before any major event since 1966. This is, in very small part, because the players the Swede has at his disposal are probably better than those available to any England manager since 1970. (Good players are by no means necessary for a mood of optimism: quite a lot of people thought England might win in 1986, when Mark Hateley was a regular.) In large part, it is because Greece won the European Championships in Portugal two years ago. The Greeks were not supposed to win, and in doing so blurred the distinction between fanciful and feasible. The moment the final whistle blew in Lisbon the build-up to major tournaments everywhere changed forever. Now there is no impossible, and fans worldwide are slightly more cheerful as a result. In the old days, only a few teams had a decent chance of winning anything, and their names were Germany and Brazil. But the Greeks gave hope to underdogs, adding to the effect caused by Turkey and South Korea getting to the semi-finals of the last World Cup (where, inevitably, they were beaten by Germany and Brazil). \"Greece\" has become a single-word rebuttal to anyone who argues that England cannot succeed this summer. Being English, we must also talk about the weather. In Japan four years ago, the players wilted in the heat and humidity. They should be considerably more comfortable in Germany. Only Brazil, tellingly, have ever won the World Cup outside their own continent. And that is the one factor reining in our optimism. However good England might be, Brazil will always be better. Because they had Garrincha, Pele and Zico, because they have Ronaldinho, the best player in the world, and because both their football and their fans are much more beautiful than ours. Perhaps our greatest enemies this summer are our own feelings of inferiority. Germany used to stir a similar sentiment, but a few years ago we thrashed them 5-1 and it seems to have cured us. One day, possibly soon, England will find a similar remedy to their Brazilian bugbear. So if you are feeling optimistic enjoy it - you have logic on your side. But before you invest in your limited-edition St George's Cross living-room beer-cooler, don't get carried away. One poor performance, the wrong type of niggly injury, and everything will change faster than you can say penalty shoot-out. And one final word of advice: if you want to retain your cheery outlook, don't even think about penalty shoot-outs. simon.burnton@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
