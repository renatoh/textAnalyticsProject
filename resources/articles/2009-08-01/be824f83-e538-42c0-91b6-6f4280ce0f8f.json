England and Australia haven't a clue. It probably depends what mood you are in. One day into The Oval Test and theories abound about the nature of this pitch and whether Australia's reliance on the pace bowling quartet that dismissed England for 102 at Headingley will turn out to be common sense or conservative thinking that will cost them the Ashes. Australia does not like to admit it, but it is a very conservative nation. Peter Siddle took four wickets yesterday and is the leading wicket-taker in the Ashes series, so we leant upon his expertise. First he said it was an even day, then he said it was a good day for Australia. If he has stayed there all night he might eventually have agreed that England had the game by the scruff, especially if he had been subjected to a spot of waterboarding, a tactic yet to be employed in Ashes press conferences.. This was the bowling attack that Australia were obliged to pick. On the back of an innings victory at Headingley, when all four pace bowlers functioned so impressively, to have made changes for the different circumstances at The Oval would have seemed wilful. Australia's pace bowling quartet were set to work again in defiance of cold cricketing reason. What was normally the most reliable batting pitch in England was, in Aussie parlance, dryer than a Pommie's towel. There were logical reasons to opt instead for Brett Lee's capacity for reverse swing, or the off-spin of Nathan Hauritz. Do that, the argument went, and you would be able to smell the Pommie fear. Shane Warne told everyone who would listen that Australia should have picked a spinner, and had he offered to put some kit on, he might well have been offered a game. When it comes to ordinary mortals, though, there are times when change cannot be contemplated. The steadiness of Stuart Clark, brought back as a Headingley specialist, had helped to settle Mitchell Johnson's scatty Ashes series and to remove his calming influence for the final Test would have risked a relapse. Siddle was the leading Aussie wicket taker, able to rough up England when it mattered most. And as for Ben Hilfenhaus, willing and able all summer long, a bowler's bowler, England supporters had learned that they only had to mention his name and nod meaningfully to assume the air of a cricketing intellectual. \"When all four quicks stuck together and bowled to the plans we had success,\" Siddle said. \"The new ball carried through with plenty of pace, but we realised after lunch that we had to be patient. It's definitely going to be a result for sure.\" Siddle is an old-fashioned bruiser with the innocent expression of a cartoon character. The more hostile and aggressive he becomes, the more contentment he spreads. He is Australia's Pied Piper; children would flock happily around him even as the ambulance carted off another batsman to A&amp;E. Some have dared to suggest he looks like SpongeBob SquarePants on Nickelodeon, but when Siddle bowls it is the batsman who tends to soak it up. It was Siddle's new-ball spell that set the tone, one of the fastest of the series, including a battering for Ian Bell, who narrowly escaped an appeal for a gloved catch down the leg-side. Johnson caught the mood, peppering Bell with three short balls in turn. Australia have been quick to notice Bell's obsession with standing tall and have turned a psychological crutch into a technical vulnerability. \"He was the main target out there,\" said Siddle. Bell, who is sporting a strange, wispy moustache, which is probably his version of the tough-guy beard when the going gets tough, probably did not need reminding. Australia were bent upon discovering how to reverse-swing the ball early in the tour. At Worcester, against England Lions, Clark was anxious to prove his Test pedigree but instead was told to bowl the ball across the seam to batter it to bits so that Brett Lee could try to reverse it. Lee was unplayable. Then Lee was injured, the Met Office backtracked on their talk of a barbeque summer and Australia chose to win by other means. Instead of Lee griddling England, we are now in the world of the slow-cook casserole. Siddle does not seem the casserole sort \u2013 his unpredictable aggression during the first Test at Cardiff promised to turn every ball into an event - but patience has been Australia's watchword all series and his spell of 9-5-11-2 in the middle of the day exemplified it. \"I'm happy bowling maidens,\" he said. In Cardiff, such a sentence would have been unimaginable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
