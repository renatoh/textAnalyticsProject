The move will see Permira invest about \u00a3200m to join the finance firms Candover and Cinven as joint owners of Gala with a 30% stake. Gala is one of Britain's largest gaming companies, operating 30 casinos and 166 bingo clubs. It was bought by Candover and Cinven for \u00a31.2bn in 2003. John Kelly, chairman of Gala Group, said: \"The backing of Cinven, Candover and Permira - three of the biggest buy-out firms in Europe - gives us even more financial firepower and flexibility. Gala is in the very best position to grow and exploit the opportunities arising from a more deregulated gaming environment.\" The deal, which also involved a refinancing of the company's debt, brings to an end the possibility of a stock-market listing. Earlier this year Gala appointed three investment bankers to examine the move. The bankers working on the possible flotation valued the group at between \u00a31.75bn and \u00a31.8bn, lower than the Permira deal. A Gala spokesman said the company also favoured Permira's investment because it was a faster process than flotation. Under the deal, Candover, Cinven and Gala's management team, which will remain in place, sold equity to funds advised by Permira. Martin Clarke, partner at Permira, said: \"We have been admirers of the Gala business for many years and approached Candover and Cinven because we have long believed the prospects for its business are strong. \"Gala has proved itself time and time again, through impressive earnings growth and its ability to generate cash.\" Gala will join Permira's leisure and retail portfolio, which includes the women's clothing store New Look, Little Chef, Travelodge and the leisure firm Holmes Place. In a joint statement, Candover and Cinven said: \"In the two years since we acquired Gala, the company's organic growth track record, robust cash flows and further expansion into the casino market have delivered strong investment performance. \"This transaction, and a previous refinancing, have allowed us to return more than our initial combined investment to our investors while retaining a majority stake in the business.\" Gala has spent \u00a3220m on upgrading its casinos and bingo facilities in the past eight years and hopes to exploit the deregulation of the gaming industry later this year, which will include the abolition of the \"24-hour rule\" under which those who want to play bingo have first to join a bingo club. Gala is on course to generate earnings before tax and charges of about \u00a3155m in the year ending in September. It employs 10,000 staff in Britain, with 1.2 million casino members and more than 5 million bingo members. It was sold by Bass to CSFB private equity for \u00a3236m in 1997 and has been owned by Candover and Cinven since they backed a management buyout from CSFB in 2003, when the company was worth \u00a3285m. They received \u00a3275m in January when they carried out a \u00a3945m refinancing. Earlier this year Gala said its sales growth was driven by the increasing popularity of bingo halls, especially among young women attracted by its relaxed atmosphere. A decade ago the vast majority of women at bingo halls were over the age of 50 but now 61% of Gala's female clients are under 45 and 37% are under 35, it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
