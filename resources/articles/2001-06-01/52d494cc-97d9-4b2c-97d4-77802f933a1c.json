A keen internet gambler, Dan hardly ever strays into the bookies these days as the comfort of gambling from his desktop during the day rules out the need to face the once-popular betting office. \"The advantage of gambling on the internet is that it's tax free and most sites now offer a couple of free bets as an incentive,\" Dan says. Dan uses a number of internet sites to place bets but rates Eurobet, Sporting Odds and Odds Checker as his favourites. \"Some companies have racing as the main sport, while others may have a lot of prices on the cricket,\" he says. \"It's a case of surfing the internet and finding companies which seem to offer what you're looking for.\" Dan says most sites are now relatively easy to use, and because he's regularly looking through the prices as part of his job, he gets a good feel for a safe bet. Tennis and horse racing are his favourites for a flutter and with Wimbledon coming up, he's spending more than ever. \"I usually bet between \u00a310 and \u00a320 a time, and I probably place about 10 bets a week. But with Wimbledon coming up, I am spending a bit more,\" he confesses. \"The most extravagant bet I ever made was \u00a370 on a 4-7 odds on tennis bet. Fortunately I won, as any bet over \u00a350 is a lot for me.\" Although Dan is a keen online gambler, his hobby doesn't extend to interactive TV gambling - at least not yet. \"I might be interested in armchair gambling. At the moment the convenience of betting from my desk top at work is enough for me - but I certainly wouldn't rule out TV gambling in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
