Edmund put in an impressive charge by winning a Challenger event on clay in Buenos Aires on Sunday \u2013 with the team captain, Leon Smith, looking on \u2013 to sneak back inside the top 100, putting pressure on his more experienced compatriot, as well as Aljaz Bedene, who will learn just before the team is announced if the ITF has granted his appeal to become eligible for his adopted country despite having already played Davis Cup for Slovenia. Edmund, speaking before starting the long return journey from Argentina, said: \u201cThe whole point of coming to South America was to prepare for Davis Cup. Otherwise I would have stayed on hard courts. But I was very happy with this plan anyway because I like clay and I feel like I play well on it. It\u2019s turned out well, I\u2019ve beaten some decent players and it doesn\u2019t do me any harm. But the team comes first and I\u2019ll do whatever the team and the management feel they need from me.\u201d He beat the world No127, Carlos Berlocq, 6-0, 6-4 in the final, having gone through a reasonably strong field for the loss of one set in four matches to get there. The prospect of making history, helping Great Britain to victory in Belgium at the end of the month, and for the first time since 1936, does not appear to faze him. \u201cI haven\u2019t played a [Davis Cup] match yet and it\u2019s quite rare for someone to play their first one in a final. But it\u2019s just one of those things. It\u2019s a special environment, a different atmosphere, but having been to matches as a hitter and sat on the sidelines won\u2019t have done me any harm. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that atmosphere and, if I\u2019m picked, I won\u2019t be going out there thinking: \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t played before.\u2019 Even top players get nervous in the Davis Cup and it\u2019s just about how you deal with it.\u201d It has not been untrammelled progress for the South-African-born player from Beverley. \u201cAt the US Open I was one point away from qualifying, but it had been a really good year until that point. I\u2019d been consistent and my ranking was going up. Unfortunately, I went down on the practice court at DC and wasn\u2019t able to play. \u201cThen I went to the States and had two first-round losses, which is something you don\u2019t want to happen, and lost a little bit of momentum. But a lot of people take two losses in a row, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s that big a deal. Now it\u2019s been great to get these wins out here and regain that momentum. Matches are so important because when you\u2019re match-tight it\u2019s a good feeling. You can train as much as you want but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d The win lifted Edmund 11 places in the world rankings, keeping him 56 spots in front of Ward, although he is still a long way behind Bedene, who is ranked at 45. The only other British players inside the top 200 are Brydan Klein (177) and Dan Evans (185), who beat the rising American teenager Frances Tiafoe 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 to win a Challenger in Knoxville on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
