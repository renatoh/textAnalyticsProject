They have won two of their past seven matches, with the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United leaving them third in the Premier League and 14 points behind Liverpool. With the centre-back John Stones out for several weeks because of a hamstring problem, the prospects of a third consecutive title look remote. G\u00fcndogan, speaking before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Dinamo Zagreb, offered an honest assessment as to why. \u201cIf you are successful and have won so many things sometimes you lose focus,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of confidence and you recognise you didn\u2019t play as well as you can. But this is not the way you want to end up \u2013 you want to improve again. It\u2019s now our challenge to bounce back. After two great seasons it\u2019s even tougher to do three titles in a row. It\u2019s normal to have this period but the only way is to stick together. \u201cEvery player has to take responsibility to reach his best level again. The sooner we can do that the sooner we\u2019ll be successful again. We are strong mentally and we should be able to do our best. We start from zero against Dinamo, we have to prove ourselves, put in a good performance.\u201d City have qualified as group winners and Pep Guardiola will use the match as an opportunity to give Phil Foden only his fourth start of the season. The manager believes the 19-year-old can become as pivotal for City as David Silva, who leaves in the summer. \u201cThat is our wish,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cDavid is a legend \u2013 the amount of games and titles \u2013 but it\u2019s our wish and we believe Phil can do it. Like David he is skilled in small spaces. Phil has pace and rhythm at 19 and he is also box to box like an English midfield player. He only needs minutes and when he has them he\u2019ll get what he needs. \u201cHe\u2019s growing from last season. There are still some departments in which he can improve. Sometimes he has to think a bit more about decision making especially without the ball. It\u2019s normal with his age and his development is perfect.\u201d Dinamo Zagreb (4-5-1, probable): Livakovic; Stojanovic, Ademi, Dilaver, Leovac; Kadzior, Olmo, Moro, Gojak, Orsic; Petkovic. Manchester City (4-1-4-1, probable): Bravo; Cancelo, Garc\u00eda, Otamendi, Mendy; G\u00fcndogan; Mahrez, Foden, B Silva, Sterling; Jesus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
