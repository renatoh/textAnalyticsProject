The 34-year-old Kent opener will learn this evening whether the county he captained until the end of 2005 require him in 2007, which made yesterday's innings of 155 - his highest score for four years - a faultlessly timed performance. The Kent committee will also consider the fate of the former England swing bowler Martin Saggers, who has played only two championship matches this season, but the news that Geraint Jones has not been awarded one of the ECB's 13 central contracts for 2006-07 could place further financial strain on a club that last year suffered record losses of over \u00a3300,000. Kent are also believed to be in the hunt for a new fast bowler - possibly Richard Johnson of Somerset - but Fulton, now in his benefit year, could yet prove to be money well spent. Playing only because of the absence of Rob Key, who missed this game for personal reasons, Fulton marked his 200th first-class match with all the assiduousness of old. He unfussily added 123 for the first wicket with Joe Denly, who made 66 before falling to Chris Silverwood's nip-backer, then put on 196 for the third with Matt Walker, who completed a century of his own. And although Fulton departed half an hour before the close, the committee could yet face a tough decision. Middlesex, meanwhile, displayed precisely the kind of insipidness with the ball that has led to a double relegation this year. Only Silverwood looked much of a threat, and Owais Shah's dropped sitter on the long-off fence when Walker had 73 seemed to sum up their season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
