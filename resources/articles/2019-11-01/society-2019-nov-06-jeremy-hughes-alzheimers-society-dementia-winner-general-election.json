Before she was even shown her room, she and her daughter were taken to the manager\u2019s office and asked how they intended to meet the difference between the home\u2019s fees and what the council was prepared to pay on her behalf. \u201cThe inhumanity when people are under enormous stress has got to end. We cannot put up with that,\u201d says Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, the UK\u2019s leading dementia charity, which this week celebrates the 40th anniversary of the letter that led to its founding. The charity wants social care reform to be as big an issue in the general election campaign as it was in the 2017 contest. It was controversy over the Conservatives\u2019 plans for reform, branded a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, that sent their campaign spinning off course two years ago. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society coined the term in 2010 to describe the penalty \u2013 typically \u00a3100,000 \u2013 that people with dementia already faced for enduring a condition not covered by free NHS care. That remains the case today. Hughes, 62, thinks there\u2019s \u201ca fair chance\u201d of winning reform if the issue gets traction over the next five weeks. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society will be urging election candidates to meet some of the estimated 850,000 people living with dementia, and their carers, to hear what needs to change. \u201cWe\u2019ll gladly help them to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll also publicise them if they don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a comment reflecting his reputation as a wily campaigner who, during his nine years in the job, has more than doubled the charity\u2019s annual income to about \u00a3110m, signed up 3 million people to be \u201cdementia friends\u201d \u2013 an idea he readily admits to having pinched from Japan \u2013 and stimulated the set-up of more than 400 dementia-friendly communities. He has also been willing to work with both the Daily Mail and Daily Express newspapers on their respective campaigns against the dementia tax \u2013 even though he acknowledges their main focus is enabling homeowners to avoid having to sell their properties to pay for care. He is, he says, aware of the risks of framing the debate in a way that not only excludes people whose care is funded by the state, but also makes the economic issue the overriding concern at the expense of care quality, and marginalises younger people with support needs. His relationship with the mid-market tabloids is, he admits, \u201clove-hate\u201d. But it has undoubtedly helped win him regular access to decision-makers up to and including Downing Street. In September, he accompanied actor Barbara Windsor, who has a dementia diagnosis and is an ambassador for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, for a highly publicised meeting with Boris Johnson after he had promised extra funding for social care. \u201cHe was desperately trying to get her to say how wonderful he was,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cShe, to her great credit, stuck to her guns and said, no, it was not marvellous \u2013 people still had to pay for their own care.think he thought about it more in that half-hour than he had ever thought about it before.\u201d Other charities would give a lot for such access. Does he ever sense any jealousy, or get told that the charity is skewing the broader social care agenda? \u201cNo, I know what you are getting at, but as [NHS national clinical director for dementia] Alistair Burns says, if you get it right for dementia, you get it right for everyone else. I very much believe that dementia can be in the vanguard of social care reform.\u201d He is now \u201cmore confident than before\u201d that long-awaited reform will happen, including action to address what the Alzheimer\u2019s Society says is a need for a \u00a32.4bn a year \u201cdementia fund\u201d for England to end unfairness in the system. He is also upbeat about the prospects of a breakthrough in research into drugs for dementia, after it emerged \u201c that US company Biogen is seeking regulatory approval for a drug, aducanumab, which has shown new promise in tests in slowing mental deterioration. We are not that far from having a non-invasive diagnostic tool to identify those at risk in their 40s and 50s, with the potential now also of developing a statin-type drug that can arrest progress of the disease,\u201d he says. Hughes has announced he will be leaving the Alzheimer\u2019s Society next year, completing a decade as chief executive, and recruitment of his successor is under way. The news coincided with reports of unrest over management style among the charity\u2019s 2,200 paid staff, but he insists there is no connection, and points out that the most recent staff survey \u2013 which achieved an impressive 75% response rate \u2013 found that 91% were proud to work for the organisation. He will stay in the field as chair of the World Dementia Council, which he takes up next year, but he is looking for another executive post in a different, if related, sphere. \u201cSome kind of public services role, which may or may not be a charity,\u201d he muses. \u201cI\u2019ve always helped organisations and causes move forward, make a step change, and I\u2019m keen to do that again with somebody if they want me.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 62.
