The crowd trouble comes as concerns grow about hooliganism at next year\u2019s World Cup finals in Russia. During a goalless first half, filled with missed opportunities, a flare was fired from the Spartak supporters massed at one end of the ground towards the centre of the pitch, landing close to the referee Deniz Aytekin, who was standing in the centre circle. It is far from the first time that Spartak\u2019s fans have overshadowed the team\u2019s efforts. Spartak were fined a total \u00a38,500 by the Russian football union after racist slogans were displayed on a banner and violence marred a league match against Arsenal Tula in April 2015. Spartak, who welcome Liverpool to Moscow in their second group game in two weeks\u2019 time, were held to a draw after Damjan Bohar\u2019s 85th-minute equaliser for the hosts. Elsewhere in the Champions League, the holders Real Madrid got their defence off to a winning start in Group H with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring twice and Sergio Ramos adding a third against Apoel Nicosia. Shakhtar Donetsk stunned Serie A\u2019s Napoli with goals either side of half-time to win 2-1 in their Group F match, while Besiktas were also surprise winners in Porto, with Ryan Babel completing the scoring for the Turkish side in a 3-1 victory in Group G."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
