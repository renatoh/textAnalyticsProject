Aubameyang, the Borussia Dortmund and Gabon striker, was given the award this month, leading to complaints from Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 Ayew that he did not deserve it. But Aubameyang, 26, who has scored 27 goals in 27 games this season, hit back at Tour\u00e9, the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder, and Ayew, the Swansea and Ghana forward. \u201cI spoke with Ayew, I did not understand [his attitude]. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Golden Ball [of Africa] is played on all season and my calendar year was not bad. It hurt me and that\u2019s a shame.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
