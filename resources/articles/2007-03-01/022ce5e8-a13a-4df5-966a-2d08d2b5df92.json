A damning report from the environment, food and rural affairs committee says the introduction of the single payments scheme was a catastrophe which wasted up to half a billion pounds and left many farmers struggling to cope. It warns of failures from the top of Defra to the Rural Payments Agency, with crucial decisions being made jointly. The RPA had warned the department repeatedly that its payment method was complex and high-risk, but the only person held responsible was Johnston McNeill, who lost his job as chief executive of the RPA. \"If accountability is to mean anything the position of others must now be seriously questioned. Those involved should examine their consciences about the role they played in this failed venture which could well cost Defra and farmers up to half a billion pounds,\" the MPs conclude. \"When a department fails to deliver a key programme right at the heart of its fundamental responsibilities the ... secretary of state should not be rewarded with promotion but its reverse. New ministerial guidelines should now be drawn up to make it even clearer that if individuals are prepared to accept the glories that come with high office they also know what to do if departmental failure occurs.\" It also calls for the head of Sir Brian Bender, then permanent secretary at Defra and now the senior civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry. \"If a failure to deliver on such a scale had occurred in a major plc, the chairman and the senior operating executives would have faced dismissal from post. With this in mind the committee continues to be astonished that Sir Brian Bender continues to hold the rank of permanent secretary. If he does not tender his resignation the head of the home civil service [Sir Gus O'Donnell] should explain why a failure such as this results in no penalty.\" The MPs warn that if ministers and senior officials are not held personally accountable, there is a serious risk of further failures. The report raised eyebrows, given its timing - Ms Beckett is handling the crisis over the British hostages in Iran - and surprised colleagues, given her reputation for competence. A spokeswoman for Ms Beckett said: \"She has not yet received a copy of the report. At Defra, she took decisions in good faith based on the information and expert advice given to her.\" A Defra spokesman said the department would consider the report. \"Defra has apologised for the problems farmers have experienced as a result of the implementation of the single payment scheme. \"A new management team is in place at the RPA. There will be no let up in putting in place further measures aimed at delivering a stable and reliable payment system.\" The Cabinet Office said: \"Sir Brian Bender continues to enjoy the full confidence of the prime minister, his secretary of state and Sir Gus O'Donnell.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
