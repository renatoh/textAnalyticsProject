Johansson has already played the character, aka Natasha Romanoff, in a string of previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including Captain Marvel, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Romanoff is a former KGB assassin and current agent of SHIELD, Marvel\u2019s fictional counter-terrorism organisation. Johansson is also acting as executive producer on the film, which is directed by Cate Shortland (Berlin Syndrome). At Comic-Con in July Johansson described the film: \u201cWhere we find Natasha in her life at this point is very specific \u2026. She really is in a dark place where she\u2019s got no one to call and nowhere to go. She\u2019s really grappling with her own self \u2026 In that moment, you actually have to face yourself.\u201d Black Widow is due for release on 30 April in Australia, and 1 May in the UK and US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
