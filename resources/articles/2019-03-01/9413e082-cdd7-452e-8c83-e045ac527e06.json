A 17-year-old boy has been charged with murdering Yousef in Hale Barns in Trafford on Saturday night. He has also been charged with possession of a bladed article. Another boy, also 17, has been charged with assisting an offender and possession of a bladed article, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. Neither can be named for legal reasons. They remain in custody and will appear before Manchester youth court on Wednesday. At about 6.40pm on Saturday, police were called to Gorse Bank Road to reports that a teenage boy had been stabbed. Yousef died in hospital a short time later. He was a pupil at the prestigious Manchester grammar school, having won a bursary to attend the fee-paying school in 2013, and lived in Burnage, south Manchester. He was studying four A-levels and had aspirations to pursue a career in medicine, his school said. His family said he had telephoned shortly before the murder to say he would be home for tea and that they were \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d. They said: \u201cYousef was a loving and caring son and brother and he meant the world to his family. He was a sporty young man, a dedicated student and so bright. He had everything to look forward to. \u201cWe are absolutely devastated and cannot believe that our son has gone. This senseless loss has affected the whole community. \u201cYousef had only phoned home hours earlier to say that he would be home for his tea, but the next knock at the door were officers with the tragic news. It is every parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d The high master of Manchester Grammar, Dr Martin Boulton, said: \u201cIt is impossible to make sense of such a senseless act, which has taken away a proud family\u2019s son, a dear friend and a young man of such promise. There has been an outpouring of grief at school at this tragic loss. \u201cThe thoughts of the whole school community are with Yousef\u2019s family. At this time, we would ask that the privacy of his family and friends is respected, while we all mourn and seek to come to terms with what has happened.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
