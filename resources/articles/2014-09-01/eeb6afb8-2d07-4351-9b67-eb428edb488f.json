Big Bother more like. Yuk. The same controversy accompanies almost every season of TV\u2019s answer to the gastric balloon (it makes you feel like you\u2019ve watched something, but that\u2019s just the pocket of gaseous anti-TV filling your innards). So why such shock that, once again, That Bullying Show has found another way to provoke prime-time ignominy? Big Brother Australia\u2019s latest shame-gimmick, taken straight from the pages of Getting Your Show Cancelled For Dummies, was instructing the housemates to line up behind the person they wanted to stay in the house. Mathematically, you could argue, this is less humiliating than being evicted by the public where, rather than 12 people voting against you, there are hundreds of thousands. However, it\u2019s not the public that housemate Gemma was trying to get along with in this Ikea hellscape, but the very people now visibly abandoning her. Fan outrage at this public hazing is a healthy response, but it also begs the question: \u201cHave none of these so-called fans ever watched the show?\u201d Just off the top of my head, I remember this season\u2019s housemates being deprived of food and fed nothing but protein shakes, asked to stand on a podium in the cold, and flatpacked two-by-two into miniature houses on wheels until either hunger or urination made them question their commitment to the cause ($30,000). To this, the only response the average viewer probably mustered was a particularly aggressive fart, absorbed by a sofa that\u2019s been sat on through so many series of this cultural rubble that it\u2019s now less furniture, more a weathered death mask of their buttocks. Big Brother is founded on humiliation, yet it\u2019s only when the abuse is made conspicuous that we kick up a fuss. When I occasionally watch the show (for masochistic research purposes), I have to double check the TV listings to make sure I haven\u2019t accidentally tuned in to a particularly dull addition to the Saw movie franchise; some soft-core sequel where the killer has become jaded enough by people carving out their own giblets that he\u2019s decided his victims eating torture-porridge for a week is enough. It\u2019s not just the tasks that betray BB\u2019s dedication to humiliation. The show also has an uncanny ability to pick\u2019n\u2019 mix housemates in such a way that it redefines the symptoms of cabin fever. Even its celebrity version. How could no one have predicted that Jade Goody, her boyfriend, and her mother would have reacted with such ignorant malice towards Shilpa Shetty, or that Jim Davidson would have broken down, or that Gary Busey was not suitable house fodder? These celebrities could just have easily not been cast, yet their inclusion is proof of an exploitation philosophy that rebrands mass bullying and humiliation as spectacle. Toss in some rusty swords and you\u2019d have The Hunger Games. Condemning Big Brother for a glaringly obvious moment of public hazing fails to condemn its wider apparatus. I agree with Dr Linda Shallcross, the Griffith University academic who said this latest eviction is something children shouldn\u2019t see. But that suggests there\u2019s an aspect of the show they should see. It\u2019s a bit like saying children shouldn\u2019t watch the basement scene in Pulp Fiction. And what about us? Given our capacity to be entertained by humiliation, we shouldn\u2019t be so shocked when TV production companies provide us with exactly that. We have always watched Big Brother hoping for conflict, embarrassment and friction. Without these things, the show is just CCTV of the world\u2019s most boring human zoo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
