Her most recent effort, Ceremonials, suffered from being even more overblown than its more amiably large predecessor, Lungs, yet the very idea of an Unplugged album places her in danger of paring it back too far, and leaving Welch's voice exposed to the elements, which are not always kind. That's exactly how this plays out. By removing the strident, strange production values of Drumming Song or Cosmic Love, for example, their original appeal is bleached out, and those not enamoured with that Welch wail will find no refuge in this state. It's hard to see who, other than her army of mini-Florence fans, will go for it, though there are the odd moments that render it not entirely pointless: What the Water Gave Me sounds even more spectral stripped back, and Josh Homme appears for a decent cover of Jackson, the acoustic setting lending itself perfectly to a country singalong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
