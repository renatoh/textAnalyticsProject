New owners, more horses, financial stability. A kitchen extension. Maybe just a new car. But when you have already beaten cancer, survived serious injuries that have left you with metal plates and screws in both arms and legs, and entered racing's folklore as the rider of the great Dawn Run, the peaks and troughs already on the graph give greater perspective. Not that Jonjo O'Neill will forget the victory of Don't Push It last April. Between O'Neill, the champion jockey, Tony McCoy, and the horse's owner, JP McManus, the trio had accumulated an aggregate of 62 previous failed attempts to win the race. Ending that long losing sequence left O'Neill feeling astonishment, rather than the rapturous joy that might have been expected. \"It was shock, deep shock,\" he says now. \"It was amazing to think we'd done it. We got back [to Jackdaws Castle near Cheltenham] at about 10pm and the horse arrived at about the same time. We fed him and let him out into the field then we all went to the Plough [the pub, both fortunately and unfortunately situated at the bottom of the field where his horses gallop]. I think we woke up in the Plough the next morning. Then we realised that people were going to come and want to see him, so we quickly found him, trotted him up and down and gave him a stretch. It was unbelievable. There was not one scratch on him. \"AP [McCoy] went to Southwell that day, to ride, but afterwards JP took us all over to his place in Ireland for a party. We went in the helicopter, me and Jacqui, AP and Chanelle, and Alan Berry. We didn't really go to bed for three days.\" Don't Push It cantered today for the first time since missing an intended appearance at Warwick last weekend when he was found to have pulled a back muscle. But despite that being only the latest setback in a catalogue of woes for the 11-year-old, O'Neill is still looking forward to bringing him back to Aintree on 9 April in his attempt to become the first horse since Red Rum to land the race twice. \"It was only a minor problem and we'll be looking for races again soon for him,\" the trainer says. \"He's going to have more weight in this year's race, but he's a big, strong horse and he can carry it. I'm more worried about the weights that the other horses will have. \"If he goes back in the same form and enjoys himself as much as he did last season, then he would have a great chance. Last year there was no pressure, as he'd run poorly at Cheltenham, but this year there is a lot more because expectations are higher. I'd like to run him over fences beforehand if I could find a race that would suit him, and ideally win a race with him to help get his confidence up a bit.\" Far away from the state-of-the-art facilities most of the 105 horses trained at Jackdaws Castle enjoy, Don't Push It's idiosyncrasies mean he is trained almost entirely from the field, with O'Neill and McCoy keen to deflect praise for the horse's preparation towards Alan Berry, the amateur jockey who is the horse's constant companion at home. \"He is a quirky horse, big and strong, but so is Alan, so they work well together,\" says O'Neill, who also hopes to run Synchronised and Can't Buy Time in the John Smith's-sponsored contest, which will defy cutbacks elsewhere to offer \u00a3950,000 in prize money. \"He lives with half a dozen sheep as he weaves and box-walks when he is in a box. Basically, he does everything a horse shouldn't do.\" However, it was Don't Push It's undoubted class that led the trainer rightfully to steer McCoy towards riding him in last year's race ahead of the four other McManus-owned runners which he could have been on board. \"I told him to toss a coin and he tossed it a few times until he got Don't Push It,\" McCoy said in the aftermath of last year's victory. \"You need a touch of class to win the National \u2013 that's all,\" says O'Neill, once again his role in proceedings. \"Although he'd fallen a couple of times, he's generally a good jumper, and he is a class act on his day \u2013 I still think he'd have won the Arkle but for falling two out [in 2007].\" McCoy is set to remain loyal to Don't Push It in this year's race, rather than chance his arm with another horse. Loyalty is important to O'Neill, but after a life full of drama, so is the craic. \"It might not have changed my life but it was great fun last year. I have never had so many people stop me in the street. It was fun and more fun. That's what you do it for. You want to enjoy it because there are a lot of bad days in this game. Dark days. \"If you were add up all the hours you work, and that goes for everyone in the yard, you wouldn't do it for the money, you know. It's the glory, the kick you get out of it. I still get a kick out of it talking to you about it now. The times you've dug the snow out of the way just to be able to open the boxes to feed the horses become worthwhile. That's what it's all about. It's a great game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
