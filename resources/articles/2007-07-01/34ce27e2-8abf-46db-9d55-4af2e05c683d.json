This jaunty story - an unusually musical domestic pet, an actress's unwise choice of upper clothing - was offered as reward and relief, like a sorbet at the end of a meal of strong meat. But the convention of the playful payoff revealed two assumptions about television journalism: that the audience would sit attentively through a whole bulletin; and that there was a league of seriousness for news stories, in which war, murder, mortgages and cancer research were placed before sport, which in turn was ranked ahead of jokes. Even now, a key part of interviews for jobs in TV and radio news asks the would-be employee to construct a \"running order\" for a programme from a list of notional items. Is a stabbing in Solihull more important than a massacre in Africa? Does a movie star's aversion to underwear matter more than a scheme to get under-12s reading? In the last five years, the correct answers in these interviews have sharply changed. The ambitious applicant would be sensible to avoid the suggestion that exposed celebrity genitalia are inherently less noteworthy than starving Ethiopians. The tradition of \"and finally\" items lapsed partly because, these days, what might once have been a light signoff could easily be leading the headlines. But juggling with running orders is no longer enough. Reports from the BBC Trust and the regulator Ofcom warn that some sections of the population - younger, poorer, non-white - are running from running orders completely and refusing to watch news. One Ofcom solution is to reduce the rules of impartiality by which British networks, unlike those in America, are bound. The justifications, according to the regulator's paper, are that barely half the audience now believes that the bulletins are politically balanced and that the pressure of even-handedness may result in bland reporting. Openly partisan or specialist news channels, Ofcom suggests, might be offered as an option alongside traditional A-says-B-says approaches. This suggestion sensibly accepts that impartiality in news reporting is largely a myth. All mainstream UK coverage of the terrorist attacks on London and Glasgow assumed that this was barbarism planned by psychopaths, which may be moral common sense but, as might strongly be pointed out in the Middle East, isn't objectivity. There are numerous smaller issues - from the benefits of going to school, to Lewis Hamilton's performances in formula one racing - on which British networks are wildly one-sided. Yet the Ofcom proposal operates from a version of the assumption underlying the \"and finally\" feature: that, if \"young news\" or \"black news\" is provided, the viewer will dutifully consume the coverage from beginning to end. Yet such an idea derives from a time when the supply of news was limited. Now, many viewers flick between bulletins, newspaper websites and blogs, creating impromptu personalised bulletins which make the notion of \"editorial balance\" absurd. Of all the media, broadcasting has most struggled to adjust to this pick-and-mix culture. For example, newspapers and magazines have strict hierarchical running orders - the result of highly paid officials, many of them white and middle-aged, deciding that one subject belongs on page one while another is \"back of the book\". These imposed preferences, though, are subverted with remarkable ease. If consumers decide that what they want first is the celeb chat, horoscope, recipe or racing prices, there is nothing the editors can do to stop it. The difficulty for broadcasting has been that, until the very recent introduction of red-button interactivity, there has been no way of allowing viewers to begin with the showbiz or sport. Increasingly, though, technology will allow television and radio to be flicked like a magazine. Interactivity has so far generally meant taking content from the audience - \"Jill in Dundee says Alan Johnston's release has made her day!\" - but will evolve into giving the news to them: many broadcasters are experimenting with bespoke bulletins tailored and delivered directly to the individual. Yet, though technology has made the switch, too many mindsets in the traditional media remain locked on the idea of running orders. Objectors will point out that the likeliest consequence of dropping impartiality rules in broadcasting or encouraging viewers to construct their own bulletins is the same as the result of offering children a choice between spinach and chips. Some - perhaps many - viewers may choose to consume only rightwing rants against immigration, or football results. In this marketplace of news, some products - that Lib Dem reshuffle, this torture in China - may be left lying ignored on the stall. Yet, even if such emphases are regretted, there is nothing that broadcasters can do to wrest back editorial control. The truth and lies are out there and the audience will decide which help them sleep best at nights. And, finally, journalists are going to have to accept this. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
