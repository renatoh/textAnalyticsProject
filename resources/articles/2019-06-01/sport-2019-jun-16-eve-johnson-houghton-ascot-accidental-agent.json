The glow of success, she says, \u201cwent on for a good six-to-nine months\u201d. If she can repeat the trick on Tuesday, with the same horse in the same race, it might last all year. On paper, Accidental Agent had little chance in last season\u2019s Queen Anne Stakes, the Royal meeting\u2019s opening race. On the track, however, he charged down the straight mile, passing more fancied runners from the powerhouse stables of Aidan O\u2019Brien and Saeed bin Suroor, to win at 33-1. It was a very rare success for a smaller trainer in a sport where size is increasingly what matters and the big money scarcely comes off second best. In football terms, it was not just a cup upset but one achieved away from home against a full-strength lineup, and there are very few cup minnows who can shock Premier League opponents two seasons running. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare apples and pears,\u201d Johnson Houghton says. \u201cI can\u2019t compare myself to the huge yards. They have huge firepower and lots of money going in there and good luck to them, they do a fantastic job. We\u2019re not playing on the same field, but it just goes to prove that when we\u2019ve got a good one, we can do it.\u201d Now she hopes to do it again, with the same horse and in the same race, a feat not achieved for 112 years. Again, Accidental Agent will need to beat a favourite trained by O\u2019Brien in Le Brivido, though odds of 12-1 do seem a little dismissive given last year\u2019s winner beat Le Brivido in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury last month. \u201cIt\u2019s Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s, so of course it\u2019s the favourite,\u201d says Johnson Houghton. \u201cThey always put him in as favourite. But I can\u2019t see why he\u2019s going to turn the form around. \u201cHe [Le Brivido] had already had a run [at Newbury]. Why is he going to turn the form around with me, with Laurens [second] or with [the winner] Mustashry? Laurens and us, neither of us had a run before [this season], so you\u2019d like to think we\u2019d have the biggest improvement out of the first four or five and I know we\u2019ve come on for the race. \u201cWe were using it as a trial and I knew he\u2019d need it. I\u2019d have liked to get a run into him before that but I couldn\u2019t, I ran out of time. So he needed it and he\u2019s come on for it hugely.\u201d Accidental Agent has not won in three starts since last year\u2019s success, and beat only one horse home in his two subsequent outings in 2018. \u201cHe had a few problems,\u201d says Johnson Houghton, \u201cbut we\u2019ve sorted those out. We\u2019ve upgraded some of the facilities in the yard with the money [from last year\u2019s win], we bought a new spa and things like that, and we\u2019re probably up on numbers and quality since then as well.\u201d In fact, her historic Woodway stable near Blewbury in Oxfordshire is in rude health. It may not welcome dozens of seven-figure yearlings through its doors every spring, but the Classic winners trained on its gallops in the past include Gilles De Retz, the 50-1 winner of the 2,000 Guineas in 1956. According to the record books, Gilles De Retz was trained by Charles Jerdein. In reality, his preparation was overseen by Helen Johnson Houghton, Eve\u2019s grandmother, in an era when the Jockey Club refused to issue trainer\u2019s licences to women. \u201cThat was before my time,\u201d the current licence holder says, \u201cbut in the grand scheme, not that long ago at all. Women were not deemed capable of that sort of thing.\u201d Accidental Agent proved 12 months ago that the latest Johnson Houghton in charge at Woodway is more than capable. He was a big outsider and so, in some eyes, a lucky winner but his trainer is unconcerned. Without Parole, a year younger than Accidental Agent, won a Group One over a mile later in the afternoon but finished behind her runner at Newbury last month. \u201cThey said they weren\u2019t very good four-year-olds last year and the three-year-olds were better,\u201d she says, \u201cbut Without Parole didn\u2019t get anywhere near them at Newbury, he hasn\u2019t proven himself from that generation. \u201cHe can only beat the horses in front of him, and if they\u2019re not as good as the horses of 10 years ago, so what? Who cares? I won.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
