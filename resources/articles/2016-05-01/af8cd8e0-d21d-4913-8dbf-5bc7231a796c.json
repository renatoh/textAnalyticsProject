There is another saying in Bach\u2019s native Germany \u2013 \u201cwash me but don\u2019t get me wet\u201d \u2013 that rather seems to sum up the attitude of the Olympic family to a firestorm that began as a localised outbreak at the Monaco headquarters of the world governing body of athletics, has shifted to Japan and now threatens to spread to the IOC\u2019s headquarters on the banks of Lake Geneva. Questions that were supposed to have gone away after the Salt Lake City scandal over how the IOC conducts bidding for its most prestigious events have aligned alongside the Russian doping crisis and the panicky atmosphere surrounding the countdown to the Rio Olympics to create something of a perfect storm. Since the Guardian revealed the Tokyo 2020 bid had made seven-figure payments to a company linked to the son of the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, already implicated in earlier corruption charges linked to Russian doping, Japanese officials have, day by day, been forced to reveal more information about the contract. The more they dig, the deeper the hole. When the question was first put by the Guardian to the Japanese Olympic Committee \u2013 whose president and IOC member, Tsunekazu Takeda, was head of the bid and sits on the board of the organising committee \u2013 the response was that it was away on business for a week so would not be commenting. The Tokyo 2020 organising committee, already beset by difficulties ranging from an embarrassing stadium design U-turn to a logo plagiarism row, said simply it had \u201cno means of knowing these allegations\u201d. Despite Takeda and other officials spanning the bid and the organising committee, a spokeswoman Hikariko Ono said: \u201cWe believe that the Games were awarded to Tokyo because the city presented the best bid.\u201d In three days of questioning from opposition MPs in the Japanese parliament the fog has slowly started to clear as they have probed the links between Diack, who stands accused by French prosecutors of accepting more than \u20ac1m for covering up positive drug tests, and Black Tidings, a Singaporean company. Diack was at the time president of the No1 sport in the Olympics and a key powerbroker among the IOC membership, particularly in Africa. Diack remains in France, having surrendered his passport, but has never publicly commented on the allegations. It has now been established that the first payment, of $950,000, was made for a contract with Black Tidings that ran from 1 July to 30 September 2013 for consultation on lobbying activities. According to Takeda, the second contract worth $1.375m ran from 5 October to 30 November and included \u201canalysis on bid winning factors\u201d. We are being asked to believe $1.375m was knowingly paid after the bid was won for what was described by Nobumoto Higuchi, the deputy chief executive of the now dissolved bidding committee, to Kyodo News as a 30-40 page document on how they did it. \u201cIt had a good deal of substance in it,\u201d he said. Japanese broadcasters had tracked down Ian Tan Tong Han, the registered owner of Black Tidings, to an apartment in Dakota Crescent in Singapore. Tan was said by Dick Pound\u2019s Wada report to be a constant companion to Papa Massata Diack, Lamine\u2019s son, since the pair met at the Beijing 2008 Games and so devoted to his friend that he named his son after him in 2014. In the clip a man in his twenties emerges from an apartment that does not appear to be the sort of place from which multimillion dollar consultancy contracts are typically serviced. He says he is co-operating with the authorities. Hajo Seppelt, the fearless documentary maker who ignited the slow-burning Russian doping scandal, told the Guardian it appeared to be the same man who appeared in blurred form in his 2014 programme and was later identified by Nick Davies, a senior IAAF official, as Tan. Another report, this time in the Singapore newspaper Today, said: \u201cWhen this newspaper visited the flat yesterday, a woman who identified herself as Tan\u2019s mother said that her son stays with her sometimes when he is not overseas for work. She added that Tan was at work but refused to comment further.\u201d We are asked to believe that a youthful sidekick for the former IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack, now holed up in Dakar with an Interpol wanted notice and denying all wrongdoing, was paid more than $2m for consultation work \u201cincluding the planning of the bid; tutoring on presentation practice; advice for international lobbying communications; and services for information and media analysis\u201d. Claims first published in Le Monde in January about a spending spree on watches and other luxury items on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es by Papa Massata Diack have been connected to the revelations about the payments. The Japanese outlet Kyodo News reported this week that Diack\u2019s son spent around \u20ac130,000 on high-end jewellery in Paris around the time of the first payment from Tokyo 2020, transactions that are believed to be under consideration by French prosecutors. It was impossible not to be reminded of a 2008 email seen by the Guardian this year. In it, Papa MassataDiack appeared to be in discussion with a Qatari contact over \u201cparcels\u201d to be delivered to six influential IOC members identified only by their initials at a time when it was bidding for the 2016 Olympics. It is also hard to see how the Japanese marketing giant Dentsu, which has an all-encompassing deal to handle the IAAF\u2019s marketing rights until 2029 under a contract negotiated by Diack and has a hugely powerful position in Japan, can avoid tough questions. Athletic Management &amp; Services, an outfit based in Lucerne in Switzerland that is partly staffed by executives who formerly worked for the controversial Fifa contractor Internation Sports &amp; Leisure, was said by Pound\u2019s report to be a service company for Dentsu. Dentsu denies that AMS is a subsidiary but admits they have a \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d. Pound\u2019s report said Tan was retained as a consultant by AMS. On its website it boasts of \u201ca long-term relationship with the Japanese advertising giant, Dentsu\u201d and says its role includes \u201csuccessful delivery and commercialisation\u201d of the world athletics championships and the FINA world aquatics championships \u2013 both Dentsu properties. Industry insiders say it has very few other clients. Coincidentally, Takeda, who like others in the interlocking worlds of sports politics and business wears many hats, also heads the IOC marketing commission. Around the table of that commission also sits one Haruyuki Takahashi, a long-time friend of Sepp Blatter, who is a former senior Dentsu executive. He was accused last year by the hospitality ticket agent Benny Alon, whose allegations helped bring down the former Fifa secretary general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, of asking him for \u20ac2m to give to Blatter. Blatter and Takahashi denied the claims. As the Japanese parliamentary inquiry, which the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has insisted must get to the bottom of the issue, and the French police investigation, so far admirably probing even in light of the nascent Paris bid for the 2024 Olympics, continue their work it must be hoped that the tangled web will unravel. \u201cThe reality at the time was that we couldn\u2019t win without consulting power,\u201d said Higuchi. Just what that consulting power bought them is just one of many questions hanging over the IOC at the end of one of its worst weeks since the height of the Salt Lake City scandal. Bach, who will travel to Tokyo with his executive board, said: \u201cWe have all the instruments in place to fight against corruption but we are not immune from corruption. We do everything we can to address and to fight this evil.\u201d As a one-time protege of the Adidas scion and ISL founder, Horst Dassler, Bach is better schooled than most in the backroom deals and cynical real politik of modern sport. He must now prove his words will be borne out by actions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
