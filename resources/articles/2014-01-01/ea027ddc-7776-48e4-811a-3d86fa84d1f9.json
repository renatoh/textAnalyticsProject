You could draw on a number of words to describe this contest \u2013 competitive would not be one of them. Having put one shy of 50 points past Leicester just before Christmas, Saracens have taken a bonus-point away win at Worcester and now this, a thrashing of Gloucester at Kingsholm, no less, whose scoreline barely hints at how bad it was. It took Saracens until the 21st century to record a win at Kingsholm, by one point in 2005, which they followed up in 2011 with a win by two, so to be able to say that this was their biggest win at Kingsholm is not in itself remarkable. It is hard to remember a more comprehensive defeat of Gloucester in their fabled stadium by anyone, even allowing for Exeter's win there in October. A 27-0 win by Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the Heineken Cup of 2005 springs to mind, as does a good working-over by Munster in the 2008 quarter-final. That may yet prove poignant, with the Irishmen due on Saturday for a pool encounter. If Gloucester play as meekly \u2013 even uninterestedly \u2013 as they did at times here another great crack will open in their creaking fortress. \"We're bitterly disappointed with that first-half performance,\" said Nigel Davies, Gloucester's director of rugby. \"It just wasn't good enough. But Saracens were the architects of that. We knew what was coming. We didn't deal with it.\" What came was a first 30 minutes, in particular, of precision, intensity and imagination that Mark McCall, Saracens' director of rugby, reckoned was as well as they have ever played. He singled out the contribution of Brad Barritt, who made a first start since his injury on the opening weekend of the season and already looks good for an England recall. In the head to head with the man who has replaced him in the white shirt, Billy Twelvetrees, Barritt's victory was about as comprehensive as Saracens'. Quite rightly, Barritt deflected such observations. It would be unfair to draw any conclusions on one man over another in such a one-sided contest but Barritt endorsed McCall's comments about the quality of the Saracens squad. \"I'd say this is the strongest the team has been in my time here,\" Barritt said. \"We've made massive strides forward in combining all phases of the game. The small tweaks we've made to our attack are paying dividends. We scored three great tries today in tough conditions, and I think there could have been a couple more.\" have a huge Heineken Cup fixture of their own on Sunday in Toulouse, so the inevitable flurry of substitutes followed. Two yellow cards, served concurrently, did not help even if they managed to win the eight-minute period they were down to 13 by three points to nil. The bonus point never came, but no matter. Saracens sit top of the Premiership with 50 points after 12 rounds, and they go into the game with Toulouse full of confidence. \"We're in a good place,\" said McCall. \"That's not to say we'll win next weekend, but we'll go there expecting to win, rather than hoping to.\" Gloucester Cook (M Thomas, 62); Sharples, Tindall (Monahan, 62), Twelvetrees (capt), May; Burns, Cowan (Robson, 54); Wood (Y Thomas, 75), Edmonds (Dawidiuk, 45), Puafisi (Knight, 45; Puafisi, 75), Stooke (James, 61), Hudson, Cox, Kvesic, Morgan (Evans, 64).
