Speaking after hitting 96 here in the first Test against India - his highest score in internationals for almost a year - as England closed the opening day of the three-match series on 268 for four, Strauss said he had benefited from being left out of the one-day matches against West Indies and spoke of the dangers of an increasingly bloated fixture list. \"No one likes to miss any cricket for England,\" he said. \"But I was feeling a little bit jaded after the Durham Test because I'd been doing it for 18 months non-stop. It's not so much a physical tiredness as a mental thing - the stresses and strains of the international game can wear you down a bit, especially if you're not in great form. \"I felt really refreshed after these last four or five weeks. It was great to have a little bit of time with my county, Middlesex, and time to think about what it is I do when I bat well. Sometimes when you're playing all the time you don't have the chance to do that.\" Strauss went into this Test having played only six innings in the previous month, including two Twenty20 thrashes. His poor sequence of two half-centuries in 17 Test innings might have continued if Dinesh Karthik had accepted a simple offering when he had 43. But he survived to add 142 for the second wicket with Michael Vaughan, even if two late mishaps removed some gloss from England's day. They will now be hoping that, weather permitting, Chris Tremlett will justify his surprise selection ahead of Stuart Broad on a pitch described by Strauss as having \"more zip\" than most Lord's strips."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
