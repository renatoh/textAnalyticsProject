'My father would play devil's advocate and switch sides halfway through,' says Tolson, now 84. 'I was fascinated. I wanted to be just like him.' But this was no skirmish between bickering parents. It was the practice session of the Wiley College debating team that was about to change the course of American history. In 1935 the Wiley College debaters, coached by Professor Melvin Tolson Snr, became the first all-black team to win the national university championships. The team, made up of two men and one woman, triumphed over white Ivy League institutions with unprecedented success, blazing a trail for equal rights in a time of extreme racial segregation. Now the little-known story of how three African-American undergraduates took on the system and won has been made into a Hollywood film, directed by Denzel Washington and produced by Oprah Winfrey. The Great Debaters, which is due for American release on Christmas Day, will also star Washington as the professor who inspires his young charges to challenge the endemic racism of the times through the power of words and a lethally accurate eloquence. In the movie the Wiley team is shown beating Harvard University - a victory believed to have taken place in one of the opening rounds of the championship. The story has been adapted for the big screen by scriptwriters Robert Eisele and Pulitzer prizewinner Suzan-Lori Parks. Forest Whitaker will co-star as the disillusioned father of one of the students who finds himself competing with Tolson for his son's affections. Despite receiving almost no pre-publicity - Washington prefers to research his films out of the limelight - the movie has already generated substantial pre-Oscars buzz on the internet. The Wiley team, referred to as the Alpha Phi Omega Forensic Society, lost only one debate out of 75 in the run-up to the national 1935 championship, talking on topics such as civil rights and freedom of speech. The three debaters - Henry Heights, Hobart Jarrett and Henrietta Bell Wells - were said to be especially successful in the art of presentation and rebuttal. On 1 April, the team overpowered the national champions, the University of Southern California, in front of a 1,100-strong audience. It was a David and Goliath victory in an era when lynching was frequent in the Deep South. The debaters' unexpected success in a time of racial disharmony caught the national imagination. When the actress Mae West heard of the team's story she asked to meet them in person and her autographed photo was displayed on the wall of Tolson's campus office for years. Thirty years before the civil rights movement made an impact, the debaters became heroes of the oppressed minority. Wiley College had been founded in 1873 by the United Methodist Church to educate freed slaves. Tolson, a professor of English who became one of America's foremost Modernist poets before his death in 1966, was the son of a Methodist preacher and believed in challenging his students by taking the opposing view in discussions, forcing them to clarify their own opinions and express them more cogently. He was renowned as a brilliant speaker, and his insistence on precision in use of language left his students in fear mingled with awe. 'He was very energetic,' Melvin Tolson Jnr, a retired French professor who lives in Oklahoma, told The Observer. 'He loved to talk and he loved to have regular family meals with me and my four siblings where we would sit around the table and discuss whatever came up. He would encourage us to defend our position, so we did and we ended up having quite a lively discussion. I remember friends being surprised when they came over to my house at the level of noise. Mr Washington interviewed me for his research, and I'm sure he will do a good job of playing my father. I'm not sure it will be particularly surreal seeing my father at the movies. I'm of an age when many things seem not entirely real.' A controversial figure, constantly under fire for his unconventional teaching methods and radical political views, Professor Tolson made a lasting impression on his students, inspiring many to pursue lives of academic achievement and social action. One of his pupils, the civil rights activist James L Farmer, founded the Congress of Racial Equality. Farmer, who was just 14 when he enrolled at Wiley College, recalls in his autobiography that his debating sessions with Tolson gave him a passion for tackling injustice. Another debating protege, Heman Sweatt, pursued a pioneering lawsuit against the University of Texas School of Law in 1946 after it refused him entry on grounds of race. The school was forced to desegregate. Of the original 1935 team, Hobart Jarrett followed his mentor into academia, becoming an eminent English professor at the City University of New York. The only surviving member of the Wiley College championship team, Henrietta Bell Wells, is now 95 and still lives in Houston. Although she spoke to Washington last year as part of his research, she is in failing health and can't give interviews. In her 1931 yearbook entry, however, she remembers Tolson as her 'crabbiest teacher'. 'You didn't dare turn in an essay with a spelling mistake,' she said. 'He would walk in the door [and say] \"Bell! What is a verb?\" And you'd better know. He was hard on his students. They were scared, but when they got out they knew English.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
