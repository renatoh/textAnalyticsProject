She also has a role in Dunham\u2019s HBO TV comedy Girls. Appropriate Behaviour has an indulgent, slightly precious autobiographical feel \u2013 but it is funny, risky and in exhilaratingly bad taste. Akhavan plays a version of herself, Shirin, the daughter of well-to-do Iranian expatriates who left after the 1979 revolution. She now lives in Brooklyn, teaching film to five-year-olds, of all the wackily improbable things. Having dated men, she is now in a tempestuous relationship with the severe, sexily bespectacled Maxine (Rebecca Henderson) and unsure how or if to come out to her parents as gay, or bisexual. As in Girls, there are references to Sex and the City (though none to Friends, or to Phoebe\u2019s famous song: \u201cThen there are bisexuals, though some just say they\u2019re just kidding themselves\u2026\u201d), Akhavan is candid about sex, and she has a great scene when a three-way she\u2019s involved in after a couple pick her up in a bar goes weirdly wrong because the man suspects his partner is into her in ways he doesn\u2019t like. There is also a great moment when she is given self-esteem coaching by the assistant in a lingerie store who says she deserves a great bra: \u201cJust because your breasts are small, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not legitimate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
