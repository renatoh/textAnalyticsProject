I come from something.\u201d There are many reasons to cheer Billy Connolly. Him being possibly the greatest standup comedian of all time is a sound one. But in his documentary dotage, he\u2019s brilliant at being himself on TV and knowing how much limelight to hog. He knows he\u2019s a big deal, but he wants to share things that interest and delight him \u2013 and they are usually other people. So it was that the first half of his televisual autobiography Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC Two) \u2013 it concludes next week \u2013 was often not directly about him. Instead it was an almost tangibly vivid portrait of 1960s Glasgow. Connolly\u2019s horrible, well-documented childhood was skipped over as he rhapsodised about the lives of Clyde shipyard workers \u2013 a mass of men devoted to football, beer, swearing, hammering at colossal pieces of metal and being funny. Billy started by sitting in the Sarry, AKA the Saracen Head in Gallowgate, to sing the pub\u2019s own song (\u201cThe girl that I marry will have to be / Able to swallow more wine than me\u2026\u201d) and lament the passing of the days when Glasgow men gathered there to talk about another punishing, deafening day at work, and to see if anyone ordered a white tornado, ie a pint of the dregs the glass collector would tip into an urn behind the bar. It was a male-centric story, provocatively so, but for a reason: Connolly was explaining where he came from and how he became a man. Intoxicating as the evocation of \u201cthe blether, the laughs and the deep respect for culture\u201d that made him love his pre-fame life was, his wisdom was also brought to bear on sectarian bigotry and the drudgery that the dockers\u2019 camaraderie was alleviating. Connolly stopped one of his joyful screenings of archive clips to point out an old shipyard colleague, one Willie McInnes, who knew of young welder Billy\u2019s performing talent and told him straight: get out, now. This was also the story of what Connolly escaped from, and how he did it was thrilling. At first he was just a guy who was \u201cpure gallus\u201d and \u201cneat about the feet\u201d in his colourful threads and unusual shoes; then he was a folk singer and ultimately a folk comedian, who replaced creaky gags with hairy whirls of rich observation, drawing on real life. Eddie Izzard explained how Connolly had more or less invented alternative comedy, while Micky Flanagan paid tribute to him simply for putting working-class experience on television. Judiciously chosen contributors coloured in Connolly\u2019s outlines throughout: I\u2019d take an entire programme of Sharleen Spiteri, Val McDermid and Eddi Reader reminiscing about sloshed Glasgow uncles. You might also have thought Connolly\u2019s close ties with John Byrne and the Glasgow art scene were funny and fascinating enough to deserve their own show. Indeed they\u2019ve had one: the lovely Billy Connolly: Portrait of a Lifetime on BBC Scotland last year, where Connolly was similarly both the centre of attention and just a humble gateway to something greater. Part one ended just after Connolly the standup properly got started, when a routine about the crucifixion became national news and attracted pickets by angry priests. It was an epic 20-minute skit that announced a brand-new comic talent, but Connolly remembered how it had started with a two-line joke about Judas buying the apostles a Chinese takeaway after mysteriously coming into money. Where had young Billy heard it? From one of his pals, down at the Sarry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
