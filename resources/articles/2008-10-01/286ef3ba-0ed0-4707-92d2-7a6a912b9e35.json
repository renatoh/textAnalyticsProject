'So I am a bit daft'", "bodyText": "It felt like a trick of the mind to remember that Aston Villa arrived here hoping to bring to an end Chelsea's extraordinary home record. Having seen his team outplayed from start to finish, it was tempting to wonder whether Martin O'Neill was offering the travelling fans an apology when he walked in their direction at the final whistle. The 90 minutes that had gone before might easily have demanded one, but it was Chelsea's majestic performance, rather than Villa's shortcomings, which occupied O'Neill's thoughts. \"I thought Chelsea were absolutely brilliant,\" said the Villa manager. \"We would have to have our best players playing at the top of their game to compete today, never mind anything else. It was a harsh lesson. It's where you want to be, what you want to aspire to, and I felt they were terrific. We didn't help ourselves, of course, but that doesn't matter. I think it's probably the best Chelsea have played. Some of the best sides in Europe might have been well beaten.\" Luiz Felipe Scolari, pictured, was equally impressed, the Chelsea manager saying his players' display had been the most rewarding since he took over in the summer. The only surprise was that Chelsea failed to turn in a more convincing victory. First-half goals from Joe Cole and Nicolas Anelka turned the final 45 minutes into little more than a procession, rather than the contest O'Neill had expected. \"I woke up this morning, thinking we would really win the game - so I am a bit daft - because we have been playing well and we came into the game at Stamford Bridge with plenty of confidence,\" said the Villa manager. \"Even when we went a goal behind I thought, 'If we can weather this, our good players will come to the fore'. But we weren't there and Chelsea were just brilliant. I thought they were magnificent and we genuinely could have learned a lot.\" Frank Lampard's performance was one which Villa's overrun midfield would do well to study, as painful as it might be to see the England international control and dictate proceedings with such consummate ease once again. With Fabio Capello watching from the stands, Lampard reaffirmed his best qualities on an afternoon when Ashley Young and Gareth Barry both failed to impress. \"I thought Lampard was absolutely outstanding,\" said O'Neill. \"He played very, very well,\" said Scolari. In truth there were many aspects for the Chelsea manager to cherish, including Ashley Cole's willingness to attack from full-back. Perhaps most satisfying for the Brazilian, however, was that this result was achieved with so many players in the treatment room. Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, Ricardo Carvalho, Deco and Alex were missing, yet their absence barely registered as Chelsea stretched their unbeaten league record at Stamford Bridge to 86 matches. \"I am satisfied because [the team] played very well,\" said Scolari. \"For me, it's the most important game in the season, because if we win we are in first position in the league and we have now a minimum of 10 days to recuperate our players. Some players will go to the national team but the other players who are injured have time to recuperate and, after 10 to 15 days, when we return to the league we will have all our players in good condition. This is most important for us.\" Scolari, who is confident that John Terry, who has a back complaint, will be fit for England duty at the weekend, pointed to Chelsea's position at the Premier League summit, their place at the top of their Champions League group and progress in the Carling Cup as reason to be content with their start to the season. \"But I want more,\" he added. There is no reason to believe he will be disappointed, according to O'Neill. \"He's a brilliant manager,\" said the Northern Irishman, who refused to accept that Villa's hopes of breaking into the top four are forlorn on this evidence. \"He's won the World Cup with a side whose expectations are incredibly high and that's hard to do, so he doesn't have to prove anything. He's enjoying himself. He's inherited a very good side and he's putting his own stamp on it, which is remarkable. I thought Chelsea were really brilliant, which is great credit to him and to the players.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
