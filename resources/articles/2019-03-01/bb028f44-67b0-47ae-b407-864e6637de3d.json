The scandal gained new momentum on Monday with the resignation of Jane Philpott, the president of the cabinet\u2019s Treasury Board testimony. Announcing her decision, she cited allegations by former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau and other senior figures had made an \u201cinnappropriate\u201d effort to dissuade Wilson-Raybould from prosecuting Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. After Philpott\u2019s surprise exit on Monday afternoon, the remaining 33 members of Trudeau\u2019s cabinet have publicly expressed support for Trudeau. Several prominent members of cabinet, including foreign minister Chrystia Freeland and environment minister Catherine McKenna, attended a campaign-style rally on Monday night in support of the government\u2019s climate change policy. Trudeau mentioned Philpotts\u2019s resignation during his prepared remarks, but a second appearance did not allow questions from the media. He has also canceled a planned appearance in the city of Regina, instead returning to Ottawa for private meetings. But the scandal is set to return to the spotlight on Wednesday when Trudeau\u2019s former principal secretary and close friend, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, the country\u2019s top civil servant, will testify in front of parliament\u2019s justice committee. A close adviser to Trudeau and longtime friend, Butts has denied Wilson-Raybould\u2019s allegations, but resigned on 18 February. Butts was a member of Trudeau\u2019s inner circle, often playing an outsized role in crafting policy and taking to social media to aggressively debate political rivals. \u201cHis testimony \u2026 will reinforce the deep, entrenched conflict on what is and is not appropriate when the minister of justice is taking on the role of attorney general,\u201d said Errol Mendes, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa. Trudeau and other officials have maintained no lines were crossed in their conversations with Wilson-Raybould. But there are questions over whether Butts\u2019 pugnacious tendencies will benefit Trudeau \u2013 or inflict further damage on the government. Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, has also emerged as a controversial figure in the scandal. Following Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony, in which she accused him of improper pressure, one parliamentarian called Wernick \u201cdeeply compromised\u201d and demanded his immediate resignation. In a letter to the prime minister, NDP member Charlie Angus described Wernick as \u201ca central player in a very political controversy\u201d and characterized his actions in the affair as nakedly partisan. \u201cMr Wernick has overstepped his role,\u201d Angus wrote. \u201cHe cannot remain clerk of the Privy Council and I urge you to ask for his resignation immediately.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s testimonies will likely feature the same arguments the government has made for the last few weeks \u2013 that top officials did nothing wrong. \u201cThey\u2019ll likely say \u2026 \u2018We stayed on the right side of the \u2018red line\u2019.\u2019 Essentially, it\u2019s her perspective that\u2019s different,\u201d said Mendes of the contrasting accounts of Wilson-Raybould and government officials. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real need for the party \u2013 and the prime minister \u2013 to have a wake-up call and do a massive mea culpa if they want this to not further damage the government.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
