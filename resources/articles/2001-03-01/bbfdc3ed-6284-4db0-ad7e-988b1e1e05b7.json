Allan Holdsworth was the one who didn't - he became a hero mainly to guitar-techies. That doesn't mean Holdsworth isn't a highly musical artist, but rather that his music is of a diamond-hard purity of repertoire and method. It doesn't come to you - you have to go to it. Holdsworth did take a few steps down McLaughlin's path 30 years ago, working for a while with international fusion stars such as Jean-Luc Ponty and Tony Williams. But his intensely focused preoccupation with long, dynamically steady and technically fearsome linear playing (he used to play the sax once, and it shows) has kept him in the position of being the remorseless guru of an uncompromising fusion-improv method all of his own. Holdsworth's power trio is at Ronnie Scott's until the weekend - and, judging by the knowing shouts of welcome for his announcements of original themes from albums of long ago, so are a lot of serious devotees, of all ages. The trio opened with a typically labyrinthine extended guitar jam over a hard funk undertow - a seamless piece of sustained improvisation full of spinning, whirling lines. The piece endorsed the guitarist's contention that he has always heard music in dense clusters of sound rather than accretions of individual parts. But there is an opposite side to Holdsworth's steely monasticism of approach, and that is the exploration of bugged-guitar electronic tone-poetry that can take on an orchestral complexity and richness. On 0274, a chordal slow feature, Holdsworth demonstrated his sonic range and meticulous care in making every sound count, even though the accelerated later stages sounded more like a chord progression than a theme. A later electronic reverie was more atmospheric, shimmering with an echoing, empty-church eloquence. Electric bassist Dave Carpenter and drummer Joel Taylor were perfect, fill-every-chink, hi-tech foils for Holdsworth's remarkable virtuosity. It's unique music, and guitarists' heaven. \u0095 Until Saturday. Box office: 020-7439 0747."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
