The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, told staff he wanted to stop paying the retransmission fees as he looks for ways to meet the funding shortfall imposed by the Coalition\u2019s $83.7m \u201cindexation pause\u201d, as first reported by Nine newspapers. Anderson has to find $14.6m in the next financial year, hopefully without cutting programming and jobs. A spokeswoman for the ABC confirmed the negotiation with Foxtel was under way. \u201cThe ABC is considering various savings measures to meet funding cuts with minimal impact to our content, services and staff, in accordance with our ongoing obligation to find efficiencies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are currently in discussions with Foxtel regarding the costs associated with the retransmission of ABC services.\u201d A 2014 efficiency review of the ABC and SBS, ordered by the former communications minister Mitch Fifield, recommended the public broadcasters stop paying the $6m for retransmission of their channels on Foxtel. Anderson has long indicated that more jobs were likely to go to \u201cfree up\u201d as much money as possible for content. \u201cDespite extensive requests from the ABC, the budget papers locked in the $83.7m pause in indexation funding flagged in last year\u2019s budget,\u201d Anderson told staff in an email after the election. \u201cThe cut comes into effect at the start of the next financial year, with a first-year impact of $14.6m. This is on top of the $254m the ABC has had to absorb in efficiency cuts over the past five years.\u201d The ABC has a \u201cFoxtel Retransmission Deed\u201d under which it is bound to pay for satellite costs and Foxtel agrees to retransmit the ABC on its pay television service. A former ABC managing director, Mark Scott, said in 2014 that if Foxtel didn\u2019t carry the ABC channels it would impact content. However, the landscape has changed considerably since then. Foxtel has been challenged by streaming service Netflix and other players which have comparatively low monthly subscription charges. Recent News Corp results show that \u201cchurn\u201d, which is the number of users giving up their subscriptions, has risen from 14.5% to 15.6% while the average spend per customer has fallen by 3% to $78. The ABC is struggling to provide all its services with a diminishing budget. Funding to make content has declined by 28%, or $336m, in real terms since the mid-1980s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
