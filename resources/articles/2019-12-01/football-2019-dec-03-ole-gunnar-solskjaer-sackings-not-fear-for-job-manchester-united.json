Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side have won four of 14 league matches and are closer to the relegation zone (six points) than the top four (eight) going into Wednesday\u2019s game at home to Tottenham. Yet the manager is confident that supporters can see the bigger picture. \u201cI can just go on the evidence of the game days and supporters I\u2019ve met,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not many I\u2019ve met that say: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something different.\u2019 They can see what we\u2019re trying to do. They know there\u2019s a lot of work being done behind the scenes \u2013 putting a culture into the team, with what\u2019s happening here at Carrington [in training]. We just need results. All the six games we\u2019ve drawn, I feel we should\u2019ve won. That\u2019s the evidence; that\u2019s all the answer we can give.\u201d As Solskj\u00e6r approaches the one-year anniversary of his interim appointment at the club, on 19 December, he believes patience is required as he attempts to make United contenders again. \u201cEveryone knows continuity is one of the keys of success,\u201d he said. \u201cSome clubs have more patience than others, some clubs don\u2019t have that time and continuity. We have a plan in place and hopefully we can get the results to speed it up. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t go at the speed you want but it\u2019s still going in the right direction. There\u2019s different aspects to this: it\u2019s on the pitch, it\u2019s behind the scenes, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the club.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r did not wish to offer a precise gauge of United\u2019s progress under him. \u201cHow long is a piece of rope?\u201d he said. \u201cResults will change moods but the mood behind the scenes is positive. I can\u2019t sit here and just talk about that; we want results. I feel we\u2019re going to stick to the plan we\u2019ve put together. Results will probably speed that up.\u201d He says he has no fear of the sack despite the recent removals of Unai Emery by Arsenal, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores by Watford and Mauricio Pochettino by Tottenham. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make me more concerned. I\u2019m just focusing on my job and that\u2019s doing as well as I can.\u201d Yet unless Spurs, Manchester City on Saturday and then Everton the following weekend are beaten, Solskj\u00e6r will not better the 26 points from 17 matches Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accrued before he was sacked last December. Mourinho returns to Old Trafford as the Tottenham manager and Solskj\u00e6r predicts \u201ca very good reception\u201d. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s just a testament to this club and these supporters, remembering he was here for two and a-half years and won trophies. I\u2019m 100% sure our fans, staff and club will welcome him.\u201d In the close season United bought Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Daniel James and Harry Maguire while selling Romelu Lukaku and allowing Chris Smalling and Alexis S\u00e1nchez to be loaned out, while Ander Herrera departed as a free agent. The manager hinted that the timing of Maguire\u2019s acquisition, three days before the window closed, and Lukaku\u2019s sale 24 hours before the deadline, hampered him in the market. \u201cWe do have a clear picture of what the squad is going to look like in June, July,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHopefully, you get as much done as soon as possible. With Harry coming in, Romelu going out, it was late. We do have a plan now.\u201d Paul Pogba is still not fit as he recovers from an ankle injury. \u201cHe\u2019s still a bit away but working hard so let\u2019s see \u2013 he\u2019s out on the grass,\u201d the manager said. The availability of Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic is also in the balance because of injuries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
