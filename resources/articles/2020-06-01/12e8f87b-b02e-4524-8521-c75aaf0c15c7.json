The sheep and wheat town, population 1,852, is 230km south-east of Perth. Its 30-foot-tall Giant Ram statue, unveiled in May 1985, held the crown for just four months before it was tragically usurped by the 50-foot Big Merino in Goulburn, which opened in September the same year. When this history unfolded, the Wagin Argus was 80 years old and thriving. The newspaper went on to celebrate its 110th birthday in March 2015 at the annual Woolorama festival, where its lone 20-year-old journalist accepted a commemorative award. \u201cWe hope to express the district\u2019s hope and expectation that providence will continue to smile on the good ship Wagin Argus and all those who sail in her,\u201d the presenter said. Six months later, she sank. \u201cFairfax planning to axe Wagin Argus, Merredin-Wheatbelt Mercury, Central Midlands Advocate\u201d read the ABC headline. The article added, unconvincingly: \u201cThe regions will instead be serviced by an expanded Farm Weekly newspaper.\u201d It was an early event in Australia\u2019s unfolding regional media crisis, now much accelerated as media giants cease to print, or shut altogether, scores of titles in the coronavirus pandemic. And it offers lessons, too \u2013 some dispiriting, others hopeful \u2013 about what the future may hold for affected towns. Asked what the Argus meant to them, Wagin locals offer various accolades: \u201cIt was the heart of everything.\u201d \u201cMy wedding photo was on the front page, a thousand years ago.\u201d \u201cIt helped hold the community together.\u201d \u201cIt was a very important part of my life.\u201d The paper covered community events with gusto, scrutinised shire politics and painstakingly documented the local footy, netball and cricket triumphs. When it closed, \u201cpeople were very lost, to start with,\u201d says the 38-year-old Wagin ambulance officer Amanda Howell. \u201cI think people relied on it. Every Thursday they knew the Argus came out and that had all the info for the week.\u201d Veana Scott worked at the Argus as a journalist, editor and photographer for 26 years before retiring in 2009. \u201cI know that sounds rather strange,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then we\u2019re farmers in the district and I couldn\u2019t move the farm and I loved my writing and I loved my job and I started just a young journo and finished up as the editor, so I did have a fair bit of power.\u201d Scott, now in her early 70s, enjoyed doing in-depth interviews, and fears that kind of reporting may disappear from rural areas as papers shift online. \u201cIt\u2019ll be three or four paragraphs of this, that or the other, and you won\u2019t be able to have that in-depth [story] that I think a lot of country people love.\u201d Phil Blight, 62, has been the shire president for the past 12 years. Did he read the Argus? \u201cEvery week.\u201d According to Blight, the town has lost a faithful historian. \u201cI can remember the front page, for example, when Donald Campbell drove through town [in 1964] after having smashed the world speed record in Lake Dumbleyung just down the road,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s recorded now in the archives of the Argus, and that won\u2019t happen again. To me that\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d If the Argus was the historian of Wagin, Don and Coral Davies are the historians of the Argus. Don worked there from 1956 to 1999, starting as an apprentice linotype operator and taking over the business \u2013 the Argus and a commercial printing press \u2013 when his stepfather, the previous owner, died in 1972. Coral handled accounts, took photographs and \u201canything that needed doing\u201d. In 1993 Don reluctantly sold to Rural Press, which in 2007 merged with Fairfax, which has since been taken over by Nine. Now aged 78 and 71, Don and Coral felt so strongly about preserving the paper\u2019s legacy that they staged a low-level heist upon hearing the bound archives had been left behind in the old Argus building when it was sold in 2012. The new owner found the annals of history simply stacked out the back. \u201cHe asked someone at the local grocery store who he should contact, and they said us,\u201d Coral says. The Davies weren\u2019t sure if Rural Press would try to lay claim to the archives, but slipped in and rescued them regardless. \u201cI guess we felt like we didn\u2019t have any authority to be doing it,\u201d Coral says. \u201cWe just made sure they were safe.\u201d \u201cIt showed you how much they thought of the area,\u201d Don says. The Davies look back with great sadness about how things ended. \u201cOne of the reasons we sold out in the first place was because we couldn\u2019t have financed the changes to digital and we knew that Rural Press could,\u201d Don says. \u201cWe sold to preserve it,\u201d Coral adds, \u201cnot to have it close down.\u201d But even as they mourn the Argus, Wagin locals are clear-eyed about its decline. At its height in the 80s, there were eight people employed across the buzzing newsroom and noisy printing press. By 2014, the paper was staffed solely by Blayde Grzelka, a teenager fresh out of high school who was doing his best at his first media gig. He spent three days a week in Wagin, living in a room at the local pub, and filed to an editor an hour and a half away in Collie. The other two days he filed for the Fairfax paper in Mandurah. \u201cIt might have been a bit too much for me to handle at the time, but I made it work,\u201d Grzelka says. There were other problems. Advertising in the Argus had plummeted, and the lucrative Woolorama program was basically keeping the paper afloat. Blight recalls making the case for the Argus to a Fairfax executive, and being told to go and count the number of ads in a recent edition. There were five. \u201cI thought, \u2018wow, nothing could survive on that\u2019,\u201d he says. So when The Argus finally folded, locals were sad, but not surprised. The model was broken. Few understand this better than Grzelka, who says he wrote for nine different Fairfax papers in regional WA between 2014 and 2017. As of this month, two are still printing. Wagin was an interesting place to cut his teeth, Grzelka says, but he became dispirited after encountering pushback on his attempts to write about mental health. As his career progressed, he struggled to find meaning in his work, and eventually left journalism. \u201cAt the end, when I was reporting there, I don\u2019t think I did a whole lot of good,\u201d he says, of the Argus. \u201cIt was just a thing that has always existed there, and they needed it to still exist, and that\u2019s why I was there.\u201d How are stories in Wagin told now? Some nearby towns still have newspapers owned by Seven West Media. The Narrogin Observer does a good job of covering the area, according to Blight, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cNot your own town, not your own identity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t quite cut the mustard.\u201d Each time a country paper shuts down there is a ripple effect, spreading out to the smaller towns in its orbit. The Wagin paper used to cover the tiny towns of Dumbleyung and Lake Grace, now the Narrogin paper covers Wagin. \u201cAnything to the east of us, there wouldn\u2019t be a journalist within cooee,\u201d says Coral Davies. Social media plays a role, with some groups and pages devoted to sharing Wagin events and chatter. Everyone agrees that this leaves out many older people in the area. \u201cWe\u2019re probably halfway between everyone being engaged with social media and no one being engaged with social media, so there\u2019s a vast tract of our community who wouldn\u2019t know what happened last week,\u201d Blight says. As Coral Davies puts it, the paper folded \u201ca generation too soon\u201d. After the Argus went, the local community resource centre started putting out a newsletter, the Wagin Wool Press. Jessica Hamersley, 70, is on the volunteer committee. The aim is to fill some gaps left by the Argus: sports news, rosters, other \u201cnitty-gritty\u201d details, and a fortnightly front-page story. Funding is cobbled together from the centre, advertising and sales. Elsewhere, community-run publications have popped up that fall closer to the newspaper end of the spectrum. In Merredin, halfway between Perth and Kalgoorlie, the community-run paper is called the Phoenix. It has no journalists, and while a council media manager criticised its quality in a 2019 survey by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, long-time residents Martin Morris and Brad Anderson say it has plugged the gap, and feels more genuinely local than the Fairfax-owned paper it replaced. New independent newspapers the Horsham Times and Ararat Advocate have recently sprung up in regional Victoria to replace titles hit by the pandemic closures, as well as the Naracoorte Community News in South Australia. Hamersley, who used to write for the West Australian, would love to see the Wool Press morph from a newsletter to a full-blown community newspaper \u2013 but adds Wagin could use some help. \u201cThat would be mighty fine, if somebody would set up some sort of \u2018how to be a local journalist\u2019 learning that we could all tap into.\u201d In the meantime, as papers continue to fold, she is worried. \u201cI think lots of things were happening before the pandemic, and have been exacerbated by the pandemic, that illustrate country Australia is losing its voice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
