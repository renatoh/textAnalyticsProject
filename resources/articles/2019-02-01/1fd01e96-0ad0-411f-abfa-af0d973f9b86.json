First, there was the basic fact that in a system that already leaves people living hand-to-mouth or, if they are lucky, paycheck to paycheck (because various modern forms of employment, fact fans, do not do anything so retro as keep you out of poverty! Let\u2019s hear it for progress!), the switch to UC leaves them without a payment for the first five weeks. If you are in a position to manage without income for five weeks, lucky you. And if you can\u2019t imagine being in quite the opposite position \u2013 if you can\u2019t imagine not even being within hailing distance of that position or knowing a single other person who is \u2013 shame on you, and would you like to take up a prominent position of your choosing in the cabinet whenever you fancy? They are looking for just your sort. There is footage, amid the shots of Nathan going hunting with his dog in the fields around Hartlepool to supplement the starvation rations he and his girlfriend are on while they await their money, of Theresa May bruiting across the Commons that the Tory party is the party that understands the working class. Second, there is the sight of a man going hunting for rabbits and squirrels in England in 2019, to supplement his aforementioned starvation rations. I must say, typing it isn\u2019t making me feel any less discombobulated. Then there\u2019s the sight of people trying to log the mandatory 35 hours of job-searching to qualify for their credit, in a place where two hours would be enough for a fingertip \u2013 fruitless \u2013 search of every nook and cranny of employment possibility. \u201cThere used to be the chicken factory,\u201d remembers one middle-aged woman. \u201cThere used to be the cake factory.\u201d Not any more. There\u2019s the recommendation by the jobcentre that Nathan become an IT technician. \u201cBut I can\u2019t read or write!\u201d he points out, not unreasonably. On and on it goes, the madness. And it is maddening. Tested beyond endurance, the documentary\u2019s subjects frequently scream down the phone at the person delivering the latest twist in the tale of no benefits. Did you, like Terri, miss your phone interview with a job coach because the lines were busy? Sanctioned. Even more delay, even less money. Miss an appointment like Nathan did, because you\u2019re illiterate and none too good at life\u2019s admin? Sanctioned. Need a high-protein (ie expensive) diet that your doctor ordered because it looks as if your cancer is back, like Nathan\u2019s mum Tracey? You\u2019re not eligible for anything. Try the local authority. You have? Oh well. Tracey, incidentally, is also the carer for her husband, who has multiple sclerosis. She will end up, if she has not already, saving the NHS a fortune. She and her daughter Tamsyn are desperate for Tamsyn not to end up on the dole herself and are hoping her talent for drumming will save her. It is the slenderest of threads. It is an unflinching series that has the balls to take as its subjects a group of people far from instantly likeable, which is the tempting and manipulative option always open to a documentary-maker, and record the fallout from the new \u2013 baffling, circuitous, intransigent \u2013 system and implicitly pose the question: how much of its dysfunctionality derives from incompetence and how much is actually by design? Not that it matters to David, who is told late on Friday, on the payphone outside the food bank he has come to, that he must complete a five-day job search before he is entitled to any money. \u201cI need something to survive on,\u201d he sobs in panicked rage. \u201cMy cupboards are empty, I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m partially blind.\u201d He cannot wear the contact lenses that help his remaining sight for long enough to be employed. His doctor has told this to many people. \u201cBut he\u2019s been defeated.\u201d Fine and honest programme-making though it is, I\u2019m starting to feel there should be a statutory requirement for a companion piece to every programme like this, where after showing life at the sharp end, those responsible for filing it to a near-lethal point are pursued by the same team demanding answers. Otherwise it starts to feel overwhelmingly like preaching to the choir. Those in charge aren\u2019t going to sit and watch in order to check how their big ideas are working out. We know there is no limit to the evidence they will ignore. The question becomes what else television can do in desperate times to hold those rich in wealth and power but morally bankrupt to account."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
