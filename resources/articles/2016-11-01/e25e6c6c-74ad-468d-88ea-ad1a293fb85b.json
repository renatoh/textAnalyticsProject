Headers from Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana and Gary Cahill secured England\u2019s biggest win over the Scots since 1975, with each of his team\u2019s goals provoking Southgate into fist-pumping celebrations on the sidelines. The former under-21s manager has secured seven points from his three World Cup qualifiers in charge, taking his team two points clear at the top of the group, and is now expected to be confirmed in the position on a long-term contract regardless of the result of Tuesday\u2019s friendly against Spain. The 46-year-old\u2019s initial reluctance to accept the role has subsided, with his desire now to build on some momentum in the group to try to shape this team\u2019s identity. \u201cI\u2019ve loved it, I\u2019ve loved it,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed the role and the responsibility that comes with it, the challenge posed by every part of it. I get that it would not be quite as enjoyable if you don\u2019t get the results, and there are nights where you have to get over the line and get the result, but it\u2019s been a brilliant experience. \u201cI\u2019ve taken so much from it. But as a group of staff we\u2019ve prepared the team really well and created a good environment. Hopefully they\u2019ve enjoyed it too. [What happens next is] not my decision. I was given the task of picking the job up in a very difficult situation for everybody, keep the country top of the group, and I feel we\u2019ve prepared the team really well. I\u2019ve enjoyed working with them. We have a difficult challenge against Spain, a great test for us, but the rest is out of my hands. The FA can decide what they want to do.\u201d The captain Wayne Rooney \u2013 restored to the starting line-up after being dropped against Slovenia last month \u2013 also added his support for Southgate. \u201cGareth\u2019s come in and done well. He\u2019s done all he can and put himself as the front runner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FA will make a decision but, from my point of view, he\u2019s in pole position and should be given the job.\u201d While England were guilty of sloppiness at times against the Scots, particularly in the opening exchanges of each half, they proved far more ruthless in front of goal than industrious but limited opponents. \u201cTonight was down to the players: they\u2019ve shown elements of what they\u2019re capable of, both individually and collectively,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThey displayed lots of the things we worked on in the week. Lots of things were really pleasing. It was important for them to come through that pressure environment and win. They wanted to respond in the right way to what they\u2019ve been through in the last few months and today was a step forward in their belief in what they\u2019re capable of. \u201cYes, some of our first-phase build-up play was sloppy and there were moments when we weren\u2019t as controlled and had to dig in. But some of our attacking interplay was very exciting. There were pleasing things about individual performances, the way we pressed with energy, and how we used the ball in the last two-thirds. Some of our use of the ball was fantastic. There were some really good signs of what we\u2019d been working on in training being transferred on to the field. To approach the game in that manner and have the confidence to employ it, that was encouraging.\u201d Southgate will assess his squad on Saturday at their Hertfordshire base as he begins preparations for the friendly with Spain. He confirmed there were no specific agreements in place with clubs to release certain players from the 25-man party, and it looks likely that Harry Kane, Nathaniel Clyne and Jack Wilshere will be granted game-time against the 2010 World Cup winners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
