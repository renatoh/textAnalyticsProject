Lawyers for the two Indigenous men, backed up by the state of Victoria, are arguing the Australian government cannot deport Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders even though they don\u2019t hold Australian citizenship because the constitutional definition of \u201calien\u201d can\u2019t be set by the government of the day through citizenship law. The plaintiffs, Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, were born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, each with one Aboriginal parent, and face deportation due to laws which allow the cancellation of visas on character grounds. Their fight to stay now hinges on a special case arguing that although they are non-citizens, they are also not aliens. At a hearing on Thursday, counsel for the two men, Stephen Keim, argued that the high court\u2019s second Mabo decision contained an \u201cunderstanding of the history of European settlement and imposition of the sovereignty of the crown\u201d which should guide the common law in the way it deals with \u201ca multiplicity of legal issues\u201d beyond native title, such as citizenship. Chief justice Susan Kiefel suggested that Victoria\u2019s submissions had taken the court into the territory of \u201cMabo No 3\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmuch wider proposition\u201d that could have implications in many other areas of law. Keim submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that Aboriginal people are \u201cpermanent Australian nationals and not aliens in Australia\u201d unless they abandon that status. He asked the court to give \u201cweight to Aboriginal Australians as the first people of what is now the Australian community\u201d. Keim submitted if the court accepted the \u201charshness\u201d of the commonwealth\u2019s submission that all non-citizens are aliens, people who became Australian citizens by naturalisation \u2013 rather than by birth \u2013 would be vulnerable to denaturalisation and deportation. This could be up to one-third of Australians, including dual citizens and those born overseas, he said. The state of Victoria, represented by Peter Willis, argued that Indigenous Australians have a special relationship with the land and waters of Australia analogous to the concept of allegiance which is the basis of recognising citizenship. That connection was \u201csufficiently close and meaningful\u201d that it answers the question of \u201cwho belongs here, who is a member of us\u201d, Willis said, and was equivalent to the \u201cairy\u201d notion of allegiance, which most Australians are assumed to have from birth despite never giving it a moment\u2019s thought or consciously affirming it. Willis said this connection was \u201cqualitatively different\u201d to that of a non-Indigenous Australian such as \u201csomeone in [hit film] The Castle\u2019s quarter-acre block\u201d. Kiefel queried how Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection to particular land could be extrapolated to Australia as a whole then to the polity of the commonwealth, suggesting there \u201cseems to be a few missing premises\u201d in Victoria\u2019s argument. But Justice James Edelman gave the Victorian arguments more credence, suggesting that Indigenous Australians can have connection to particular land as well as a spiritual connection more generally, so while a native title claim to the former may be lost or extinguished \u201cthe latter always remains\u201d. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, representing the commonwealth, submitted Victoria had invited the court to \u201cjettison\u201d the \u201ccore idea\u201d of allegiance, which had always been allegiance to the sovereign or body politic not a place. But justice Virginia Bell that the notion of the Australian polity may have expanded to recognise that Indigenous Australians\u2019 connection with land \u201cmight be inconsistent with seeing an Aboriginal person as alien\u201d. Edelman suggested both allegiance and connection to land are \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and it would be a strange result if a two-year-old born in Australia to two foreign parents was deemed to have allegiance but a two-year-old Aboriginal Australian born overseas did not despite 10,000s of years of Aboriginal people living in Australia. Several justices queried whether the connection gave rise to a permanent allegiance or could be renounced, and Willis replied that an Aboriginal Australian can disclaim their Indigeneity and become an alien by \u201cpersonal choice\u201d in the same way anyone could renounce a birthright to citizenship. Justice Patrick Keane seized on this, asking if an Indigenous Australians could disclaim Australian citizenship but retain membership of an Aboriginal group, which Willis conceded was possible because they are \u201ctwo different things\u201d. \u201cExactly right,\u201d Keane replied. Donaghue later seized on this concession, suggesting Aboriginality was \u201cnot relevant at all\u201d to Australian citizenship. Donaghue argued that the common law draws no distinction between whether Australian citizens or subjects are Indigenous or non-Indigenous. He argued that Indigenous Australians became British subjects because Britain exercised sovereignty over the entire territory of Australia, and later generations became subjects in the same way as non-Indigenous Australians. Donaghue submitted that the fact both plaintiffs were born overseas and were citizens of foreign powers was sufficient to win the case, because the constitutional meaning of alien must at least include the common law meaning, which they both plainly fit. Donaghue concluded by arguing the case had \u201cno general implications for [all] Indigenous people\u201d \u2013 only non-citizens \u2013 and noted non-Indigenous people would be deported in the same circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mabo number three \u2013 it\u2019s whether two particular people can be treated as aliens.\u201d The court reserved its judgment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
