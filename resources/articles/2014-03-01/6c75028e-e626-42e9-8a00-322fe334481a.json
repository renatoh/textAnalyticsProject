Especially in Moscow", "bodyText": "\u2022 When truth is known about the terrible fate of flight MH370, attention will turn once again to the potentially cataclysmic events in Ukraine, and there are bound to be questions about who said what and when. And on that coming day the anxious and aggrieved may well look at the strange and questionable contribution of the Eurosceptic man of war, MP Bill Cash. The lines are drawn on who to blame for the Crimea crisis. The government and most observers say it was Putin on a land grab. Cash sees things differently. \"We do not have to be enthusiastic advocates of Vladimir Putin's policies to recognise that this entire Ukrainian crisis was avoidable. Nor to recognise that the Crimea \u2013 handed over by Khrushchev within the Soviet Union to Ukraine in 1954 \u2013 has been and remains a vital national security and defence interest for Russia, including the Black Sea and its fleet for centuries,\" he wrote on ConservativeHome. Brussels should hang its head. \"The EU has pursued a remarkably naive foreign policy \u2026 the EU must recognise that it bears a disproportionate degree of responsibility for the crisis which could have been avoided.\" Wonder what William Hague thinks of this. \u2022 Wonder what he thinks of Cash's interview on Putin TV, the cable channel properly known as Russia Today, or RT. It was glad to have him on. Even more so when he'd finished. \"The EU attitude has been extremely naive. I would go further and say it has created a very unfortunate and dangerous situation,\" Cash said. He should try a Black Sea holiday. He'd be welcomed. \u2022 Just a few more days until the launch of An Unexpected MP, Jerry Hayes's memoir of high politics, high jinks and skulduggery in Westminster. Yesterday we highlighted the section about Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn. The two worked together at talk radio station LBC, where Littlejohn was a presenter. They did not get on, and before long Hayes was dispensed with. In the book Hayes claims Littlejohn, having had a drink, baited one of the company's burly drivers and only escaped a thumping by passing out in the back of the car. Hayes claims the driver then deposited the writer in a heap on his doorstep, ringing the doorbell before driving off. Can this be true, we asked Littlejohn. He says it might be. \"Jerry's obviously not one to bear a 20-year-old grudge over getting sacked, then. If what he says is true, I'd have been too pissed to remember.\" Littlejohn, ever harsh on the Guardianista, predicts the tale will \"keep your readers happy over their muesli\". But it doesn't. It makes us weep over standards of behaviour in hell-in-a-handcart Britain. \u2022 The Lib Dem attempt to avoid electoral wipeout at the polls, meanwhile, is attacked by gremlins. Activists strive to flag up the effects of austerity and blame the Tories. Where? Everywhere, including Leicestershire. But campaigners hoping to boost Michael Mullaney, the parliamentary candidate for Bosworth, showed voters a little too much of how these things are constructed. \"It has been a tough few years for residents across [area name],\" said the text of the feel-your-pain campaign leaflet pushed through letterboxes. No wonder folk become cynical. A tough few days ahead for whoever ran that operation. \u2022 Finally, Today presenters continue their programme of academic pilgrimage. Last week Evan Davis returned to Oxford. This week Justin Webb (BSc Government 1983) headed back to the London School of Economics. So, what are the memories of the young Webb in 1980, fresh from his sheltered boarding school in Somerset? Febrile and fertile discussion in the student canteen and classroom debate, and open dispute with a young lecturer in economic history and a worldy mature student. They were David \"the whites have become black\" Starkey \u2013 that renowned commentator on cultural affairs \u2013 and Stephen Pound, the irrepressible Labour MP for Ealing, a renowned commentator on everything. More recently, Webb recalled sharing the Today studio with Davis on a day when the ever supportive Daily Mail decided to give his fellow presenter a two-page mauling. Depressing reading, as the paper criticised Davis's interviewing style, focusing on a question to the former president Jimmy Carter. Depressing for Justin Webb, as the question held up as proof of wretched decline had actually been asked by him.
