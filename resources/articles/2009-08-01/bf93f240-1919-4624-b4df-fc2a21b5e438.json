Tonight's episode takes the senior citizen detectives of Ucos to Pinewood studios: someone has posted scenes of violence from an unfinished movie on the web, and now it's down to the ratings-winning combination of James Bolam, Dennis Waterman and Alun Armstrong to find out who. Much fun at the expense of ac-tors, and a decent yarn to boot. How the Other Half Live 9pm, Channel 4 Like a more focused Secret Millionaire, this week's rich-help-poor project sees the wealthy, self-made Mullins assisting the O'Dwyers, a family on the poverty line who struggle with the impossible task of making ends meet on an inadequate salary. The Mullins' help allows them to get a new washing machine and keep the bailiffs at bay \u2013 for now. But their problems are too deep to be fixed by a few cheques, so all the show really offers is temporary relief. What happens when it's all over? Hiroshima 9pm, History Though the events are familiar, this extensive documentary on the bombing of Hiroshima still horrifies, perhaps because the interviews with survivors and US soldiers emphasise just how recent it was. As such, there's an abundance of footage from the time and plenty of eyewitness accounts, including the testimonies of the Enola Gay's crew. The pilot's stoic account \u2013 \"It was another day. It was another bombing run. That was it\" \u2013 is in stark opposition to the hellish recollections of those on the ground, but with such powerful stories, it's a shame that this account so often falls back on reconstructions. We Are Klang 10.30pm, BBC3 The adventures of the Klang mob are beyond silly, but Greg Davies, Marek Larwood and Steve Hall are so likable as the useless council officers that it's hard not to go along with their rambunctiousness. Tonight there's an implausibly efficient juggler-burglar careering through town; he's even stolen the mayor's wig. He claims to have contracted a juggling virus: \"What, you mean to tell me juggling is catching?\" asks Greg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
