Olympic Glory (3.50) would probably prefer a bit more juice underfoot but he is not so ground-dependent as to be unable to show his true ability on this surface and looks a fair way ahead of these rivals. His final two runs of 2013 have crystallised how we think of Olympic Glory. On soft ground at Ascot, he was a stunning winner of the QEII. Then he was hopelessly outpaced on firm ground at the Breeders' Cup. His other Group One success was also on deep going, in France as a two-year-old. But it was good ground when Olympic Glory failed by only a short-head to catch Moonlight Cloud in the Jacques le Marois last summer, when Intello, Declaration Of War and Dawn Approach were all behind. This has been his target since the start of the year and the Hannons will surely have him ready. He should be hard to beat, though Top Notch Tonto is better than he showed at Sandown last time, while Verrazano is a fascinating talent having his first run for Aidan O'Brien. 2.05 Newbury Now nine, Forgotten Voice may need this but drying ground will suit and he remains an underappreciated talent on the Flat. He produced irresistible finishes at Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood last year, landing a Group Three on the latter occasion. An extra furlong or so is in his favour if he is ready to go. 2.20 Newmarket Badly in need of his first run since June, De Rigueur can be forgiven his Ripon flop. He has some very strong form from last summer with Tiger Cliff and Sun Central. 2.40 Newbury Having been an underperformer with Sir Michael Stoute, Modern Tutor is interesting on his first start for the in-form Andrew Balding. He would be better with some cut but good ground should be fine and he should be able to win off his present rating. The step back in distance suggests he will be asked to race prominently unless this really is a prep run. 2.55 Newmarket Aeolus had no luck when a close third in the Free Handicap last time. The winner, Shifting Power, was then a fine fourth in the 2,000 Guineas. 3.15 Newbury An impressive maiden winner on his reappearance, Cannock Chase should be better on this sounder surface. 3.30 Newmarket It may be worth giving another chance to Stars Above Me, beaten only by a rival who got the run of the race last time. 4.00 Thirsk This final leg of the Scoop6 will be shown on Channel 4 if there are still live tickets. Eutropius would be an unsurprising winner, having beaten a big field from a wide draw here last time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
