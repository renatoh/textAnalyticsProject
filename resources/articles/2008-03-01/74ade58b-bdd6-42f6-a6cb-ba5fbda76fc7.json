Liverpudlians and Mancunians have greater cause for fretting, yet the capital's residents are most on edge. No wonder crime and policing are such hot topics in the capital's mayoral race, crossing over into transport, environmental and even housing policies too. No wonder all three leading candidates are taking the issue very seriously. Boris Johnson and Brian Paddick have made the most running, and not surprisingly. Crime offers the Tory the chance to allege that Ken Livingstone has failed and is deaf to Londoners' biggest concerns. The Liberal Democrat, with 30 years of service in the Met behind him - including in the highest ranks - speaks with an authority his rivals cannot match. For his part, Livingstone, who launched his policing manifesto this morning, claims to have presided over policies that have brought the capital's crime rates down consistently. So what are the Big Three offering? Johnson struck an early - and, to me, unwelcome - populist note at a time when the recent (and continuing) spate of killings of London teenagers was high up the news agenda, though by the time he published his crime manifesto this had acquired a Cameronian balance, with pledges to enhance youth provision and encourage philanthropy to that end. He has highlighted anti-social behaviour on buses and other forms of public transport, promising to introduce new metal detection measures at transport hubs, trail live CCTV on buses, redeploy funds so that an additional 440 Police Community Support Officers would patrol buses and introduce a scheme called Payback London under which under-16s deprived of their present (thanks to Livingstone) right to free travel due to misconduct would be required to earn it back. Johnson has also drawn on the \"broken windows\" theory and \"zero tolerance\" police practice associated with the vaunted crime \"miracle\" attributed to mayor Rudi Giuliani and police chief William Bratton in New York in the 1990s, advancing the view that vigorously tackling minor offences - such as graffiti and vandalism - has the knock-on effect of reducing more serious ones. He has promised to make police more accountable to communities by requiring monthly meetings with the public, and to provide neighbourhoods with \"New York-style crime maps\". To demonstrate his seriousness, Johnson has said that he, unlike Livingstone, would chair the Metropolitan Police Authority. Brian Paddick too says he'd chair the MPA, saying he could work with Met chief Sir Ian Blair despite their falling out over the Charles DeMenezes shooting. But his approach differs from Johnson's in significant ways. In the controversial area of stop-and-search Johnson would lobby to dump the \"stop and account\" form officers are presently required to fill in, saying this would free up more beat time. By contrast, Paddick believes the accounting mechanism should remain and could be speeded up by using new technology and more trained admin staff. He's skeptical about \"zero tolerance\", pointing out that the New York strategy involved the use of \"soft\" measures such as drug courts and environmental improvements alongside aggressive policing and that the latter goes against the British tradition of \"policing by consent\". Paddick opposes crime mapping on the grounds that it demonises communities, and instead advocates major changes in police priorities and culture so that trust between officers and public can be enhanced and \"intelligence-led\" - rather than target-driven - street policing fostered. When I spoke with him last week he explained that such changes would enable the community-focused Safer Neighbourhoods Teams brought in under Blair and Livingstone to work better. And Ken Livingstone? Defending his record, he says there is a clear connection between the securing of an additional 6,000 police officers 4,000 PCSOs during his past four years in power and year-on-year falls in overall levels of crimes recording by the Met during the same period: his campaign team has shown me figures indicating that falls in recorded serious crimes - including murders, which are hard to miscount - have followed increases in police numbers, arguing that the former is causally related to the latter. Responding to Johnson, Livingstone has acknowledged that there was \"a spike\" in offences on buses after free travel for under-16s was introduced, but that this disappeared after police resources were targeted accordingly. Today he has announced that he'd create 11 \"Safer Transport\" teams for buses, provide a further 1,000 officers and, acknowledging the teenage gang problem, target more resources on that. He repeated his vow to improve youth provision to the tune of \u00a378 million. So which candidate do you prefer on this issue? I've written before of finding Paddick the most convincing, and I still do. This is partly because the broad picture he paints of crime in London strikes me as being the most realistic. It is accepted among experts that the British Crime Survey provides a truer account of crime trends than the statistics recorded by the police. Paddick cites BCS data, saying that far from revealing a drop in the capital's crime levels overall under Livingstone these indicate they have remained broadly flat. Paddick may not be quite right about that: he's been relying on a seemingly misleading entry (see page three) on the GLA's website when in fact BCS figures have only been broken down by region for the past two years (2005/2006 and 2006/2007) and these show slight falls. Nonetheless, those figures for London that are available seem to support his contention that many crimes are going unreported. Livingstone, by contrast, has derided the BCS as an opinion poll (which it isn't: it asks a large sample of people about their experience of being victims of crime). Johnson, meanwhile, effectively dismisses all the statistics and gives weight instead to \"headlines\" and public apprehension about crime. How else does Paddick outscore the other two? It's important to recognise that in key respects all three candidates are in accord: neither Paddick nor Johnson propose doing away with SNTs, an innovation under Livingstone; all want more officer time spent on the streets. It's important, too, to note that SNTs in London and elsewhere have reassured the public. This matters - as Johnson would confirm - because public confidence about the safety of the streets and the responsiveness of police feeds into crime prevention, intelligence-gathering and clear-up rates. Livingstone may be entitled to some credit. Nonetheless, Paddick's larger arguments strike me as the boldest and most progressive. His view that more \"effective policing\" won't be brought about if you \"just throw police officers\" at problems is in line with the recent Flanagan report and the Home Affairs Committee observation a year ago that falls in crime across Britian as a whole as measured by the BCS during the second half of the 1990s preceded increases in police funding in the early Noughties. He's also right to treat the Guiliani \"miracle\" with caution: crime was falling in New York before Rudi came to power and fell by the same amount in other parts of America where there was no \"zero tolerance\" regime. This, though, begs a more awkward question of all the candidates as they jostle to impress with their anti-crime credentials - how big an effect can policing ever have on crime levels in the first place? Perhaps we should defer final judgement on Paddick until his full crime manifesto is published - it's his big card, so he's holding it back until nearer polling day. But statements he's made so far can be found here and elsewhere on his website. Johnson's manifesto is here and Livingstone's here. Comments from the three candidates discussed and any others would be particularly welcome.
