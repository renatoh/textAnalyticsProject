Causevic was one of five Victorians arrested during police raids on 18 April, and one of three who were subsequently charged in relation to an alleged plot to target police during an Anzac Day memorial service in Melbourne. In May, Melbourne magistrates court heard Causevic was found to have knives and an Islamic flag in his possession. But Causevic\u2019s lawyer, Rob Stary, told media the terrorism charges were likely to be dropped. Causevic was the first Victorian to be held under a preventive detention order, which meant he was initially held by police for three days without charge in a maximum security prison unit. Sevdet Besim, 18, was also charged with plotting a terrorism attack and remains in custody. Mehran Azami, 19, was charged with weapons possession, police alleging he intended to supply weapons to Causevic and Besim. Causevic was due to appear in Melbourne\u2019s county court on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
