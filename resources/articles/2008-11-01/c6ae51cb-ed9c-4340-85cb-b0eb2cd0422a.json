Reports this morning alleged that Barton made a racist comment during a confrontation involving the pair following a first-half foul. However, it is understood that Agbonlahor has told Villa's manager Martin O'Neill that he does not want to take the issue to FA disciplinary chiefs, meaning the matter is now effectively closed. Barton is also understood to have categorically denied the allegations. \"Gaby doesn't want to talk about it and he doesn't want to press charges,\" said O'Neill today. The FA had insisted the onus was on Villa to make a complaint if they felt the incident warranted one. \"The FA wrote to Aston Villa this morning to ask for any information the club could provide regarding allegations reported in today's media of remarks made by Joey Barton to Gabriel Agbonlahor during Villa's match against Newcastle on Monday,\" said a statement from the FA. \"The club has responded to inform us that they have no complaints to make. On this basis, the FA will not be pursuing this matter.\" It is the second time in two days that Barton has avoided potential disciplinary action over the incident during Newcastle's 2-0 victory. Yesterday, the FA revealed the controversial midfielder would not suffer further action for flicking Agbonlahor's face during the same exchange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
