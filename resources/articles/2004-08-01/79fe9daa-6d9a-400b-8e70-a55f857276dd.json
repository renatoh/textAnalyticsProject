Thousands of tonnes of mud and boulders were swept down the steep slopes of Glen Ogle on to the A85, which links Perth in the east with the western Highlands, on Wednesday night. Fifty-seven people trapped on the road had to be airlifted to safety by helicopter. In all, more than 150 people were stranded by the flooding caused by a day of torrential rainstorms. As the rain continued to fall in Scotland yesterday and forecasters warned of yet more deluges sweeping the length of Britain in the next few days, teams of diggers clawed at the rubble on the road, which at some points was up to six feet deep. Deep gouges in the hillside above the road showed where small streams had turned into cascades of water, loosening huge sheets of earth, rocks and vegetation. By mid-morning the road had been cleared of most of the debris, and those who had been rescued returned to reclaim their abandoned vehicles. Hundreds of miles away, cleaning up continued in the Cornish village of Boscastle, which was devastated on Monday when torrential rain caused three rivers to burst their banks. Up to 25 businesses were destroyed when a 3-metre (10ft) wall of water tore through the village at speeds of up to 40mph, leaving the community facing losses of at least \u00a325m and putting an end to the tourist season. Local tourist chiefs said last night that it would be \"a miracle\" if things were back to normal before next Easter. Officers from Central Scotland police described the landslides as the worst incident of its kind they had seen. They advised all drivers to stay away from the area, which is one of the country's most popular holiday destinations. Craig Ross, 35, from Edinburgh, had been heading south after a Highland break with his girlfriend, Shona Maxwell, and their dog when the landslides struck. They spent the night in the nearby village of Killin after being plucked off the road by an RAF Sea King helicopter. \"We came to a stop where the road was absolutely blocked with boulders,\" Mr Ross said yesterday. \"We tried to turn around but the other landslide had blocked our escape route. It was just a big torrent of muddy water. \"Some people were worried that other landslides were going to come down. I was more worried about my dog getting dropped by the helicopter winchman.\" Ian Oates, 54, from Comrie, Perthshire, said: \"We saw it come down the hill, it was horrific. The ground shook and there was an enormous roar. There was just a wall of mud and water - it started coming down the road towards us. \"We started to scramble up the hill to get out of its way. We could hear more rumbling above us, everyone was panicking, and it looked like the whole hill was coming down.\" It was uncertain last night when the road would reopen. With rain still falling, experts were flown over the area to try to assess the likelihood of any further landslides. Elsewhere in Scotland the A87 road at Cluanie was partly blocked by a landslide. Four people were rescued from a car in a separate flood in Tayside. At one point 22,000 people across the country were without power. Scottish Hydro Electric said it was the worst lightning storm it could remember."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
