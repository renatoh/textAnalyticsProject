In her annual letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), she reveals the strings attached to the money with which the government intends to boost student numbers by a further 23,000 in the coming year. The education secretary calls for \"radical changes\" to fund higher education courses which are designed, funded or provided by employers. This will involve short courses and part-time courses to improve employees' skills but universities will also be expected to change their curriculum more quickly in response to learner and employer demand. The new policy looks like good news for further education colleges that can provide vocational courses at degree and postgraduate level. Ms Kelly said a strategy of growth through employer-led provision would introduce \"new sources of finance that will allow us to grow the country's high-level skills base more quickly than the public purse alone could afford, and it will yield a richer, more diverse range of provision.\" She said \u00a340m of extra funds would be allocated to widening participation and reducing drop-out rates, with funds channelled to the \"most effective\" schemes. In a move that will be welcomed by the new universities, Ms Kelly told Hefce to re-examine the costs of recruiting and retaining students from working-class and ethnic minority families, with a view to giving them more money. Funding for research will rise by \u00a395m and capital funding by \u00a355m (about 8% in both cases). In the following year (2007-08) the grant to English universities will increase further to nearly \u00a36.9bn and there should be 1.16 million student places. The funding council was praised for its work in reducing bureaucracy but warned that universities needed to make more progress in promoting equal opportunities to achieve greater diversity among senior academics and managers. Finally, Hefce itself is expected to reduce its costs by 10% by 2008."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
