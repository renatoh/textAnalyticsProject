Whether Neville, who on Friday said he wanted to take Team GB to Tokyo, will be in charge for that tournament has yet to be confirmed. White, who scored six times for England before their semi-final defeat to the USA in France last year, believes Neville has made an impact, despite the team\u2019s slide from third in the world to sixth during his time in charge. \u201cHe changed my game and it came to fruition in the World Cup. I was a bit resistant to him changing me,\u201d the 31-year-old said with a grin. \u201cSaying stay within the width of the 18-yard box, but essentially that\u2019s where you are, that\u2019s where the goal is. \u201cHe\u2019s been amazing, a positive driving force for me to get better and better and be clinical in front of goal. It\u2019s been great working and being a part of the squad while he\u2019s been with us.\u201d While Neville\u2019s abilities as a coach and tactician have come into question, few can doubt his close relationship with the players. The Lionesses have gathered at St Georges\u2019 Park for a training camp with friendly fixtures hard to come by during the pandemic. In an England home v England away training game, White scored twice and the Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone headed in a third as the team captained by White, in white, triumphed. With 30 players part of this extended autumn camp there is a youthful buzz to England\u2019s secure bubble. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some amazing youngsters coming through a great experience and this is a chance for us to rebuild and for players to stake your claim for a shirt,\u201d said White. One of those players, the forward Chloe Kelly, joined White at Manchester City having excelled on the wing for Everton in the shortened 2019-20 season. \u201cChloe is an unbelievable player and we are very lucky and blessed to have her at Man City,\u201d said White. \u201cI\u2019ll always champion her. There\u2019s big things to come from Chloe.\u201d Kelly is not the only young player to make her debut under Neville, and there are several uncapped players at England\u2019s training base. Bringing through players is something Neville said he will be most proud of when he walks away. \u201cThat is part of what I am,\u201d he said. \u201cWhichever team I manage I will give opportunities to young players. Sometimes I\u2019ve brought the younger players in quicker than probably what people wanted, but ultimately when I see potential and I see that kind of quality, it gives me a great feeling and great excitement.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
