Mustafa, his wife and children arrived in Christchurch a few months ago. On Friday he was shot dead along with 49 others attending prayers at two mosques in the New Zealand city. One of his teenage sons, Hamza, is missing; the other, Zaid, was recovering from surgery in hospital. His wife and daughter were in \u201ctotal shock, devastation and horror\u201d, said Ali Akil of Syrian Solidarity New Zealand. The family had \u201csurvived atrocities\u201d in their home country and \u201carrived here in a safe haven only to be killed in the most atrocious way\u201d, he added. Names of the dead and injured began to trickle out yesterday as many people in Christchurch struggled to find words for what had happened. Across the country, people were numbed by the mass killing, the worst in New Zealand\u2019s recent history. At a cordon a few yards from the mosques where the deadly rampage unfolded, people came, one by one, to pay their respects. A few shed quiet tears or spoke in hushed tones, but mostly they just stood and watched. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, travelled to the city to comfort the Muslim community. At the Canterbury Refugee Resettlement and Resource Centre, she told them: \u201cNew Zealand is united in its grief and we are united in our grief.\u201d The heartbreak touched many nations, reflecting the origins of those killed, injured and bereaved, many of whom were refugees or migrants. The places where they or their parents had started their lives included India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Palestine and Fiji. The first to be formally identified was Daoud Nabi, a 71-year-old who left his home in Afghanistan more than four decades ago. His son Omar said his father had described New Zealand as \u201ca slice of paradise\u201d. Another brother, Yama, who was running late for Friday prayers at Al Noor mosque, found a scene of chaos, confusion and bloodshed. Outside the mosque, a friend told him: \u201cYour father saved my life.\u201d But it was only when Yama watched the gunman\u2019s video, streamed live on social media as he carried out the atrocity, that he found an image of his father lying dead. \u201cI had to go back and forward and back and forward a lot, but I knew it was him,\u201d he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Daoud had \u201cjumped in the firing line to save somebody else\u2019s life and he has passed away,\u201d said Omar. \u201cJust helping people is his main thing. It makes me feel like he wanted other people to live.\u201d More details of the dead emerged yesterday. Four-year-old Abdullahi Dirie was at the mosque with his father and four siblings. His family members survived, but his uncle, Abdulrahman Hashi, said the boy died in hospital. Hashi, 60, a preacher at Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Minneapolis, received a phone call on Friday morning from his brother-in-law, Adan Ibrahin Dirie, who was also in the hospital with gunshot wounds. Four of his children escaped unharmed, but the youngest, Abdullahi, was killed. The family had fled Somalia in the mid-1990s as refugees and resettled in New Zealand. \u201cYou cannot imagine how I feel,\u201d Hashi told the Washington Post. \u201cThis is a problem of extremism. Some people think the Muslims in their country are part of that, but these are innocent people.\u201d The family of Sayyad Milne, 14, described as a good-natured, kind teenager with dreams of being an international footballer, had waited all day for news as to his whereabouts. By evening he was confirmed dead. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my little boy, he\u2019s just turned 14,\u201d said his father, John. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard officially yet that he\u2019s actually passed, but I know he has because he was seen. [I\u2019m] keeping it together and tears are helping. People are helping. Just by being here, it is helping.\u201d He was told Sayyad had been lying on the floor in the mosque, bleeding from the lower parts of his body. \u201cI remember him as my baby who I nearly lost when he was born. Such a struggle he\u2019s had throughout all his life. He\u2019s been unfairly treated but he\u2019s risen above that and he\u2019s very brave. A brave little soldier. It\u2019s so hard ... to see him just gunned down by someone who didn\u2019t care about anyone or anything.\u201d Sayyad was a pupil at Cashmere high school, whose principal, Mark Wilson, said: \u201cThis is an act of terror and hate; we stand in solidarity with our NZ community in condemning this horrendous crime. \u201cOur school had three current students on excused leave from school to attend Friday prayers at the main mosque. We are aware that two of these students are missing, and the other is in hospital with a wound. A past pupil of our school was also at the mosque and is also missing. We also understand that there were two fathers of students at our school who were both shot in this incident.\u201d The best response to such a hateful incident was to show love, he said. \u201cThis can simply mean being kind and caring to each other, be patient, compassionate, and understand everyone will respond differently.\u201d Many remained missing, including three-year-old Mucad Ibrahim, who was last seen at al Noor mosque with his family. His brother, Abdi, escaped the carnage while their father pretended to be dead. \u201cWe\u2019re most likely thinking he\u2019s one of the people who has died at the mosque ... at this stage everyone\u2019s saying he\u2019s dead,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty tough, a lot of people are ringing me asking if you need help. It\u2019s been hard at the moment, [we\u2019ve] never dealt with this.\u201d Sharifullah Najib, originally from Afghanistan, was at Christchurch hospital with a friend before heading to a school where a casualty list was posted. \u201cWe have come to visit people, we have lost many, many of our friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not sure who is alive and who is in the hospital. I have three friends inside.\u201d He added: \u201cNew Zealanders are supporting us a lot, they love us. They are good people, they are us and we are them.\u201d Survivors were also in severe shock. A 52-year-old father, Adeeb Sami, took a bullet to save his sons at al Noor mosque. He dived over his sons Abdullah, 29, and Ali, 23, as the gunman burst into the mosque. \u201cMy dad is a real hero,\u201d Adeeb\u2019s daughter, Heba, said. \u201cHe got shot in the back near his spine in an attempt to shield my brothers, but he didn\u2019t let anything happen to them.\u201d Adeeb was rushed to hospital where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet. \u201cI spoke to dad,\u201d Heba said. \u201cHe sounded weak and appeared inconsolable. My family survived the attack, but many of our friends didn\u2019t.\u201d Around the country, New Zealanders visited mosques yesterday to show solidarity and to bring flowers and messages of support. \u201cThis is your home and you should have been safe here,\u201d one of the messages said. \u201cSending your souls love, happiness and peace.\u201d The mood was \u201csombre, shocked, but not fearful,\u201d said a man who attended the Wellington Islamic community mosque in Kilbirnie. A photo he took of the outside the building showed messages scrawled inside love hearts in support of Muslims. \u201cThe thing that struck me most was actually the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t understand the full gravity, but they were there drawing their hearts out.\u201d Paying his respects near al Noor mosque, Egen Isaac said: \u201cMy heart and soul is in grief. I just feel astonished and grieved. This is the first time something like this has happened here, and I hope the last time it happens here or anywhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
