During his own days in charge at Newcastle United the Dutchman became so vexed he is said to have asked a Catholic priest to bless the pitch before sprinkling holy water around the home dressing room. \u201cDid Ruud really do that?\u201d said McClaren at the end of yet another frustrating match when once again the scoreline failed to reflect a much improved performance from his team. A few hours later Gullit delivered words of sympathy and encouragement from a seat in the BBC Match of the Day studio. Indeed the consensus \u2013 disputed by a slightly miffed Mark Hughes \u2013 was that Jack Butland\u2019s excellence in Stoke City\u2019s goal had denied Newcastle what would have been only their second Premier League win of the season. They remain stuck in the relegation zone with Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth assuming an importance unimaginable in August, when even McClaren underestimated the scale of the reconstruction job ahead. Like Hughes, the former England coach is in the process of converting a direct side into one capable of controlling games with passing football. The difference is that Stoke already possessed the steely spine that serves as an ideal framework within which new players and a fresh philosophy could flourish. If Newcastle\u2019s board had agreed to grant Yohan Cabaye\u2019s wish and buy the team\u2019s old midfield calibrator back from Paris Saint-Germain last summer along with another centre-half and an extra striker, McClaren would surely not be describing the Bournemouth trip as \u201cvery important.\u201d He approaches it with Tim Krul and Karl Darlow, his first- and second-choice goalkeepers, suffering from knee and ankle injuries respectively and Rob Elliot, the third in line, struggling badly with a groin problem. Does Newcastle\u2019s manager gamble on throwing the 18-year-old Freddie Woodman in at the deep end or attempt to make an emergency loan signing? Should Manchester United\u2019s out-of-favour V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s \u2013 who is believed to be the preferred option \u2013 arrive, McClaren can only trust he replicates Butland\u2019s highly convincing impression of a magnetic force field. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat what Steve said to me at the end,\u201d joked the Stoke goalkeeper, who had a stint playing for Newcastle\u2019s manager last season, making six appearances while on loan at Derby County during the autumn. Then Butland turned his attentions to Joe Hart \u2013 the man who has restricted him to two England caps. This time his message was serious. \u201cMy ambition is to be England\u2019s No1 keeper, 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a really good relationship with Joe but I want to play for England at his expense. I want to play in the European Championships next summer.\u201d Man of the match Jack Butland (Stoke City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
