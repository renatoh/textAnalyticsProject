Since it's a corporate platform, you may not have had the pleasure, but what's the worst application you've ever used? And if you're still using it, why? As expected this attracted this attracted the usual amount of Microsoft bashing, but not too many real klunkers emerged to challenge Notes, apart from Sony's SonicStage and Microsoft Access. Does no one remember Netscape 4 or Star Office 5? Has no one actually tried to use the GIMP for any practical purpose (apart from illustrating what Linux can do). What about old \"favourites\" such as Real Player, Adobe's Acrobat Reader and KaZaA? Do we really live in a Golden Age of friendly, well-designed usable applications or does no one want to compalin how yellow everything looks.... Do we have enough candiates for a vote or is Notes a shoo-in?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
