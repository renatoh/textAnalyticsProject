When they're not being shot by trained marksmen or blamed by the environment secretary for England's forthcoming early World Cup exit, they are wheezing around the south-west, making out with cows and passing on their chesty coughs. Still, it has been worse. Into our sweaty paws falls a confidential report, published by Defra this week in response to an FoI request, of trials carried out in the early 1980s at Porton Down, the MoD's secret chemical weapons facility. Their purpose? To determine whether it was humane to kill badgers by gassing them with hydrogen cyanide, a method then widely in use. Unhelpfully, this had led to a \"scarcity of badgers\", and so Lord Zuckerman, scientific adviser to the Allies during the war and at the time president of the Zoological Society of London, had a suggestion. Ferrets! Just gas ferrets instead and, to get around the inconvenient fact that they weren't much like badgers, \"extrapolate\". Accordingly, 177 ferrets made the ultimate sacrifice; their results were compared with those of four unfortunate badgers which couldn't run quite fast enough. The report is not a pleasant read (we'll spare you the details), and gassing badgers was ended in 1982. Encouraging, then, that in October the government said it was considering its possible reintroduction \u2013 \"if it was proven to be safe, humane and effective\". Lock up your ferrets. \u2022 Is the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, contemplating a similar fate? We ask because his vow to reform prime minister's questions having gone down like a cup of cold sick in some quarters, the bookmakers have inevitably begun offering odds on his successor (a Speaker is elected or re-elected at the start of each parliament, unless they trip on to their sword beforehand). Paddy Power favours Labour's \"well-liked\" Lindsay Hoyle at 11/10 with Conservative Eleanor Laing at 6/4 \u2013 radical choices, as both are currently deputy speakers, along with Dawn Primarolo (12/1). You'll also get odds of 10/11 for Bercow to interrupt proceedings \"under 2.5\" times at next week's session; 2.6 interruptions is thought to be marginally less likely. \u2022 How cheering to learn that the Foreign Office, revealed by the Guardian last year to be illegally hoarding more than a million files of historic documents that should have been made available to the public, is to hold a conference in May to discuss its plans for their long overdue transfer into the public domain. The FCO \"records day\" will see \"interested historians\" granted access to Hanslope Park, an FCO and MI6 outstation in Buckinghamshire. Great, we're there! Probably about time the public learned the contents of files concerning, among other things, to British colonial and slave trade-related history, which according to the Public Records Act should have been handed over to the National Archives at Kew. Oh, hang on. It seems the public will be excluded from seeing the \"special collections\", and with them, the press, with only \"selected academics\" getting the nod. Seems for now we must be grateful for the FCO's kind offer to release an unspecified number of files deemed \"of greatest public interest\" at unspecified times over the next six years. \u2022 A happy update, finally, to the item in Monday's Diary in which we noted the dismay of many in the mental health sector at the abrupt silencing of West Midlands police officer Michael Brown. The serving inspector wrote a much-praised and award-winning blog as Mental Health Cop, advising fellow police personnel on dealing with situations involving mentally ill people, but had seen both it and his Twitter feed under the same name suspended by his employers over allegations of \"misuse of a social media account\". We are awfully happy to report, following an apology, the giving of \"informal advice\" and what we don't doubt was a warm embrace, that peace has broken out in the West Midlands, and @MentalHealthCop is back, or at least will be, we are assured, \"later this week\". Notes Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth: \"The real issue here is communicating complex issues in an effective way.\" I love a happy ending. diary@theguardian.com Twitter: @estheraddley"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
