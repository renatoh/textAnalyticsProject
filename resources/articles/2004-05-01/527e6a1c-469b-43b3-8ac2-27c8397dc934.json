THE word on everyone's lips right now is butyl iso- butyrate. Like Methyl Benzoate (oh do catch up) it is one of the chemicals used in the 20,000 synthetic flavours that scientists have up their long white sleeves to add to our food. From herbal tea to breakfast cereals, not to mention our favourite biscuits, most foods contain several of these tastes. We sent David Rowan to the Zurich laboratory where they are researched. Among the rows of vials in the lab he discovered 300 types of flavouring for strawberry alone. Is this the future of food? Sir Terence Conran is interested in flavour too, but the real thing rather than something from a test tube. With its high walls and cold frames his own garden is a long way from my own little postage stamp, but then most of his harvest goes off to his London restaurants.

When Britain's most famous smallholder isn't getting us to grow our own carrots, make our own salami or isn't snorkling in the Seychelles, he is busy encouraging us to think differently about the way we treat and eat animals. Hugh's new book The River Cottage Meat Book is bound to be another bestseller, and we love him so much we have given him a whole page to publicise it. And talking of TV cooks, it is two years since we first became glued to our sets watching Jamie's Kitchen . So, whatever happened to that motley crew? John Arlidge tracks down the winners and the losers from Michelin-starred restaurants to Pizza Hut. And this month we also have lunch with the lovely Kirsty Wark, tea with Joan Bakewell, a Greek dinner with Theodore Kyriakou - and Lisa Hilton tells us all about having sex with vegetarians (they do it differently, apparently.)
