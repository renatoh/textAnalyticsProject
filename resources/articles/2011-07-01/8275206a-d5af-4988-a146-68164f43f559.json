In an almost wistful turn before the culture committee, he named Brown as the prime minister he was nearest to. He thought Brown had \"good values\" and their wives became close, said Murdoch, who added that his young children by his third wife, Wendi Deng, played with the former prime minister's children, John and Fraser. The News Corp chief was sorry Brown has fallen out with him, but he \"very much hopes\" they would repair their relationship one day. The two men were friends before the Sun withdrew its support from Labour, Murdoch said last week. During the phone-hacking furore, Brown has proved to be one of the most vociferous critics of the Murdoch empire, insisting the company had been part of a \"criminal-media nexus\". He was reacting to revelations that News International journalists had attempted to access his voicemail and had obtained information from his bank account, his legal file and his family's medical information. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 July 2011. The original said that Wendi Deng was the second wife of Rupert Murdoch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
