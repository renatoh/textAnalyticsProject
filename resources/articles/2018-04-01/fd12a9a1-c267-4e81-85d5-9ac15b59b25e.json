Could any of us be turned into \u201cspies, silent killers and resistance organisers\u201d? Those are questions the makers of Secret Agent Selection: WW2 (BBC2, 9pm) have set out to answer with period-era uniform, Meccano challenges and dubious psychological testing. It\u2019s a bit like The Apprentice, only instead of the prize being some cash from Alan Sugar, winners get the chance to carry out a bit of state-sponsored murder and sabotage. At least, I think they do, but I haven\u2019t watched the final episode. In this first show, 14 recruits go through the selection process for the Special Operations Executive, a secret, second-world-war army of agents \u2013 drawn from ordinary people, we\u2019re regularly reminded \u2013 created in the second world war to go behind enemy lines and bring down the Nazis. They must have \u201cfanatical enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cnerves of steel\u201d. The women must also know how to put stockings on for dinner. This is the army \u2013 and the 1940s, supposedly \u2013 so everyone is known by their surname. Dewhirst, a property developer back in the 21st century, wants to do it authentically. \u201cThe lads who did this for real wouldn\u2019t have been able to second-guess it, wouldn\u2019t have been able to Google it,\u201d he says, knowledgably. Stone \u2013 an east London drag artist \u2013 admits to being terrified. You know he\u2019s not going to cut it; he\u2019s too gentle. When a gunman bursts into their classroom while they\u2019re taking an exam \u2013 to be later quizzed on their observational skills \u2013 he dives under a desk, which seems sensible, but is apparently frowned upon. Beauclerk, a translator decended from a real SOE agent, isn\u2019t doing too well, either \u2013 she says she couldn\u2019t kill a gendarme in order to successfully attack a factory and doesn\u2019t want to crawl under barbed wire in the assault course because she might get her hair caught. Jefferys, a research scientist, soon emerges as a strong contender. She\u2019s barely 5ft tall and is the first of the recruits to successfully scale a 10ft (three-metre) wall. Could she kill someone? Try to stop her. \u201cI\u2019m going to sound like a terrible person,\u201d she says during the interview section, trying to suppress a hopeful smile, \u201cbut I think if I had the orders to kill someone, I could without a second\u2019s hesitation.\u201d She\u2019s my favourite. Four didn\u2019t make it through, including Stone and Beauclerk. It seemed a shame to lose Camara, a council administrator, who was slow at most of the tasks but also demonstrated the most bravery. I thought the selection process was supposed to be about spotting potential. It was all quite fun and the historical snippets were interesting, particularly the sparse bits of information about real agents. The SOE actively recruited women, and I was burning to know more about one of the most effective Allied spies, Virginia Hall, who had lost her leg in a hunting accident (the Gestapo called her the \u201cLimping Lady\u201d) and ran a resistance network in Lyon. Who knows what she, and the other agents mentioned, would have made of being bit players in a reality show. Still, it\u2019s interesting to see how the traits we appear to be drawn to in the modern age probably aren\u2019t ones our wartime ancestors would have valued. Asked to nominate the person they would choose as their leader, many of the recruits went for cocky Dewhirst (who in an assessment interview confessed to insecurity). Only one of the recruits, Bajaj, saw how Dewhirst could be a liability. The hapless, feckless boys from Plebs (ITV2, 10pm), the ancient-Rome-based sitcom, returned with its fourth series and a double bill. A minute into episode one, Stylax, one of the trio, is squished by a falling marble slab. It\u2019s shocking, but at least it wasn\u2019t Grumio, their gormless slave. \u201cI love funerals,\u201d says their boss, Flavia (the great Doon Mackichan). \u201cIt\u2019s where I met three of my husbands.\u201d The episode is slow after that, but culminates in the boys \u2013 including new member Jason \u2013 extorting a toilet block from corrupt property developer Crassus (a guest-starring Robert Lindsay). Episode two picks up when they decide to turn it into a gastropub, the Corona and Toga, which becomes Rome\u2019s latest hipster spot after a (faked) rave review. Grumio is the chef and comes up with an ingenious menu \u201ccalled \u2018stuffing stuff in stuff\u2019, so it\u2019s like a mouse inside a grouse or a squid inside a squirrel.\u201d The joke is so daft that it never gets tired \u2013 there\u2019s a snail in a quail, a wren in a hen, a marrow in a sparrow. \u2026 It\u2019s all undemanding and wonderfully silly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
