There are strange forces at work in the world at the moment: weather turned on its head, teams falling over themselves to allow England a safe passage in the World Cup, and the England cricket team stringing together good days like prime pork sausages. Mostly, for England, consistency is a measure of the thickness of their custard. Yet it is seven match days since England last had a duff one - the third at Lord's in the first Test, when they were dismissed for 275 by Murali-less Sri Lanka. In the second Test at Edgbaston they were so dominant that it could, if the spectators had used their imaginations, have been the Australians on a roll. The end product was the second highest innings win by England at home in the past 17 years and for the second successive early summer it brings them to a final match at Old Trafford 1-0 ahead with a series to be taken. Last year, against Pakistan, it went horribly wrong as they lost their nerve chasing 370, losing eight wickets in the final session and with it the match. The Aussies sniggered into their tinnies and considered themselves Ashes winners already. Then a few months ago England handed the final Test of the winter to New Zealand, and drew a series they had in the bag. For a tangible sign that this team is growing up, they cannot afford to let this series go, for this is their fifth rubber since the two memorable wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and they have taken none of the previous four. There may have been progress, but it counts for little if things cannot be nailed down when it matters. Doing so may not be an easy task because, as Nasser Hussain pointed out yesterday, the Manchester pitch is the least English, habitually playing like Colombo or Karachi but with chilblains. \"We were pleased to see Old Trafford on the schedule,\" said Sri Lanka's coach Dav Whatmore, and as a former Lancashire man he should know what it means for his side. \"My experience here is that it has generally been tough for the fast bowlers.\" He might have added \"unless they are Waqar Younis\", who utilised his reverse swing to great effect last year, \"or Chaminda Vaas\". England will miss Darren Gough, for he alone of the current England contenders can match such bowling. The key though will be Muttiah Muralitharan, who in two seasons with Lancashire took wickets aplenty here at a bargain-basement price. The pitch may have some moisture in it, but is devoid of grass and will surely turn. Muralitharan's injured left shoulder is recovering by the day and, according to Whatmore, he is imparting as much spin as ever. Only when confronted with England's left-handers will he anticipate a problem, caused, Whatmore feels, by imparting so much spin that leaving becomes an option for the batsmen whereas the ball moving away presents scoring opportunities. His 40 wickets against England include only Mark Butcher and Graham Thorpe of the left-handers, whereas Marcus Trescothick has scored 498 runs against Sri Lanka without falling to him. To counter the cackhanders he is bowling round the wicket but in this aspect England have his measure. Whereas Sri Lanka will be keen to get the young fast bowler Dilhara Fernando into their attack, and may shuffle the batting order, England look set to field the same team. Butcher is certain to play, although his knee could hinder him in the field, which means John Crawley misses out playing on the ground he left so acrimoniously during the winter. Ticket sales have improved with almost 35,000 sold for the first three days. Crawley though would not have been guaranteed a hearty reception. Perhaps \"Be Kind To Creepy\" badges would have been the answer. \u00b7 Television screens will be installed in the car park at Old Trafford to allow fans to watch England's World Cup match against Denmark on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
