The 21-year-old has struggled to reproduce the form of his first campaign at Old Trafford, which followed his \u00a336m move from Monaco. He started in United\u2019s 1-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday, before sitting out the 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace on Wednesday. And in a French television interview Martial admitted it was a challenge he had to confront after starting only seven of 16 Premier League matches this season. He told the broadcaster SFR Sport: \u201cIt\u2019s annoying to be on the bench. It\u2019s truly annoying but it\u2019s a test you have to overcome and that\u2019s how you progress. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because all you want is to be able to help the team and, when you\u2019re on the bench, you can\u2019t. But these are choices and you have to accept it.\u201d The signing from Paris Saint-Germain of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Swede\u2019s impressive scoring record have limited his chances but Martial is determined to play the long game. \u201cPeople expect a lot of me but sometimes they forget I\u2019m still young,\u201d he said before Saturday\u2019s trip to West Bromwich Albion. \u201cEveryone can think what they want. It won\u2019t change anything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
