Read our coverage I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. \u2013 Jared Kushner The Kushner-oligarch connection Kushner was due to return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to speak with the House intelligence committee, after talking with the Senate on Monday.

Although Sessions said last week that he would stay in his role, it\u2019s unclear how long he might be able to do so without the president\u2019s support.

Over and over again they said \u2018repeal and replace\u2019, but they can now keep their promise to the American people to provide emergency relief. \u2013 Donald Trump"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
