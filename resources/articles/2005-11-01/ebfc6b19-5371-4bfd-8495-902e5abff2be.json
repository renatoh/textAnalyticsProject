Because the two big questions were whether the show could avoid morbidity in the absence of the man who had presented it for 20 years and whether his replacement, Desmond Lynam, could come to embody the series. In Lynam's years as a television sports presenter, one of his best moments was the little joke to open a live lunchtime transmission of an England World Cup football game with the line: \"Hello, shouldn't you be at work?\" The gag is echoed in the title of his recently published memoirs, I should have been at work! Now the broadcaster, who admits in the book he found retirement difficult after dropping out of fronting ITV football, has ironically returned to work in the favourite television programme of those who don't: Countdown's core audience are superannuated, redundant or studying. Presenters recording shows for commercial television thankfully don't know what the commercials in the ad-breaks will be, and you suspect that Des's moustache might have twitched if he could have seen the breezy come-ons for joint-care vitamins, incontinence pads and meals-on-wheels that he is now wedged between. The question for both Lynam and the programme was how much to mention Whiteley. In the event, Carol Vorderman, opening the show, made a general apology for the long absence before throwing to the new host, who began with a reference to \"a difficult act to follow, dear Richard, so missed by you all\" and ended with an apology for being a \"bit twitchy\" picking up the moves that \"dear Richard\" made so smoothly. This was probably the proper level of acknowledgement, benefiting from the fact that the show has had six months off-air to prepare the transition - unlike ABC's World News Tonight, which remained in visible shock and confusion for weeks after the death of anchor Peter Jennings this summer. The problem in the opening show was that Lynam retained throughout the wary air of someone visiting bereaved relatives. As a presenter he has an acerbic streak, attracting complaints for sending up some of the minority sports featured on Sunday Grandstand and relishing the satirical gags he was given as a guest host on Have I Got News For You? In his Countdown debut, though, he seemed frightened of causing offence. When one of the Teatime Teaser anagrams prompted Vorderman to recall an old advertising slogan, Lynam instinctively snapped, in a flash of his old form, that \"it bored me then and it bores me now\", before hastily contradicting himself, \"though it worked quite well at the time\". It was like those moments when someone changes their opinion on a subject because the boss or a partner's father has just revealed his view. What he needs to realise is that treating the series and its format so reverently is a misunderstanding of what the host he is replacing did. Whiteley, who regarded his job as political correspondent of Yorkshire TV as his real work, appreciated that a teatime TV show is an essentially trivial enterprise. His technicolour chessboard jackets and punishing wordplay were a tacit acknowledgement that Countdown is at heart quite a dull programme in which mild-mannered smart-arses scribble on bits of paper with their heads down. Lynam, one of the most natural presenters of his generation, needs to realise that the more irreverent and even mildly mocking he is about the show, the truer he will be to Whiteley's memory. Only then will he become consonant with Countdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
