Nononono Just stay in 'Cause it's Thursday night, and the telly is king Thursday, Thursday, Thurhurhurhurhurhursday! Yeah! ... And that was Anna and the Vultures with their Happy Happy Thursday Night Television Song, slipping down the charts again, by an incredible 78 chart places this week. Mostly, it seems, because no one likes it, and it isn't very good. But though the lyric may be inane and the tune as bland as Budgens baked beans, you can hear the raw passion in her voice, can't you, and that's what counts, I think. Yep, yep, I'm just looking over at the Brits judges, who happen to be sitting just over there, and they say that that IS what counts. Beautiful. Speaking of the Brits, last night's awards show is being broadcast on ITV1 tonight, and can be, with the help of Culture Vulture, a fully interactive, multimedia experience. All you have to do is print out Dorian Lynskey's fabulously funny minute-by-minute account of the awards ceremony, and then read it in time with the show, out loud, in your very best Dorian Lynskey voice. Of course, as fun as that will be, for some the Blunt and Tunstall levels will soon reach depths of unbearable, erm, depth, and - I've just thought, Blunt and Tunstall sounds like a particularly ineffective brand of household drill, or a firm of window-fitters or something, doesn't it? - and they will wander off, channel-wise, in search of other eye-goodies to salve their weary soul. And they'll find them, of course, because as Anna and the Vultures' catchy chorus reminds us, Thursday night is telly night, oh yeah, oh yeah. And you can find out just how true that is by clicking right here to find out the picks of tonight's TV, taken from this week's Guide.... The Brit Awards 2006 8pm, ITV1 Hosted by Chris Evans, this year's Brits look likely to be a benefit in honour of the 21st century Chris De Burgh, James Blunt, who might have been developed solely in order to win silly trophies at bumptious corporate celebrations of mediocrity. Blunt is nominated in five categories, as are hapless Franz Ferdinand mini-mes Kaiser Chiefs; both will be performing. As if that wasn't sufficient to drive any sane viewer to watch QVC, KT Tunstall, Coldplay and Kelly Clarkson are also on the bill. The Outstanding Contribution award will be collected by Paul Weller. Andrew Mueller The First Emperor 9pm, C4 Interminable exploration of a potentially fascinating subject. Qin Shi Huangdi created modern China -- he built the Great Wall, set benchmarks for its subsequent grandiosity by entombing himself with an army of terracotta warriors, and established its long tradition of repressive tyranny by slaughtering thousands of people he disagreed with. Unfortunately, while this film contains some stunning footage of Qin's tomb, it is lumbered with wretchedly acted and written reconstructions, which reduce the immense drama of history to rehearsals for an admittedly unusually expensive village pantomime. Andrew Mueller House 10pm, Five Tonight House, along with his catalogue models in white coats, try to find out why a recent college graduate is suffering violent electrical fits. It's like he's being repeatedly poked with an invisible cattle prod. They rule out everything from MS to athlete's foot. Meanwhile, House's folks are in town for a visit but he doesn't want to see them. And he has a motorbike. It doesn't make him happy. But boy does he look a dish, sitting astride it in his rakish leathers. Julia Raeside Tony Rome (Gordon Douglas, 1967) 8pm, Sky Cinema 1 \"The action is so fast... it's a wonder Tony Rome stays alive... and single!\" Frank Sinatra lounges his way through a pulpy prototype Miami Vice role as a private eye living on a houseboat (wearing a sea captain's hat), chasing dames, solving a bit of crime, that sort of thing. With Jill St John and Gena Rowlands. Phil Howlett Boston Legal 10pm, LivingTV William Shatner's Denny Crane -- still referring to himself in the third person -- is forced into defending a far-from-repentant child murderer. He goes to extreme lengths to have himself declared unfit for the task, even appearing on The Larry King Show. Meanwhile a childhood fear of clowns resurfaces when James Spader defends Zozo The Clown, who's fired from his TV job after mixing environmental messages among the usual pie-in-the-face routines. Add a man who seeks a marriage annulment after he's been seeing a farm animal behind his wife's back and you have another fine week from the show that prefers entertainment over realism. Phelim O'Neill Counter Culture 11.30pm, BBC4 Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 takes the pulse of consumerism in the United States and finds that all is not well. The big department stores -- Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's in Chicago -- are not faring well. Whereas once they offered a total shopping experience (Marshall Field's even had a ladies' writing room), they're now trapped between upscale boutiques and the fast retail of street style and casualisation. Meanwhile, celebrities want in on the action -- J-Lo has her own label and apparently she's very hands-on; and even the usually even-handed Tyler can't resist a dig. He's off to Japan for the final episode next week. Martin Skegg ____________________________________ Mmmmmmm, Boston Legal... House.... Project Catwalk.... It's telly niiiight. It's telly niiiiight.
