This was a first home defeat of 2004 but the lack of focus it represented may be considerably more damaging. Millwall have been suffering from the anticlimax of Nationwide League football and in five outings since their Old Trafford triumph, they have failed to muster a win. An opportunity to climb above West Ham - whom they have beaten 4-1 this season - into the play-off places was lost here and with other prizes to covet it may never be regained. \"The guys are finding it hard,\" said Millwall's assistant manager Ray Wilkins. \"They don't want to pick up any knocks. But they won't have to if they move the ball around like they did in that first half.\" Quite right: in the first-half it appeared they had rediscovered their touch with a fine passing display that exposed Watford as inferior. Nick Chadwick rose to meet Peter Sweeney's free-kick, nod ding it into the six-yard box for Danny Dichio to head in his seventh league goal of the campaign. Minutes later Sweeney's cut-back outwitted Chris Baird on the touchline and his cross had Alec Chamberlain grasping for thin air. But Chadwick headed over. By contrast, Watford's first-half attacks lacked teeth. Bruce Dyer's crossing made Millwall's defence work on a couple of occasions but Andy Marshall was never really troubled. But after the interval, Watford woke up. Their manager Ray Lewington raised the tempo in the belief that Millwall's recent travails might endure and, fewer than 10 minutes after the break, his hunch paid off. Lee Cook's over-hit cross from the left fell to Paul Devlin, who instantly sent the ball into the six-yard box, from where Dyer forced it home. Paul Ifill had been booked for dissent in the first half and was withdrawn, along with Tim Cahill. The Australian's edginess and being just one booking away from a five-game ban made him ill-suited to what had become a gritty contest. It was Watford's Cook who took the responsibility of lighting up the match. A surging 15-yard burst ended in a cracking shot that flew past Marshall for Watford's second, a goal that surely secures their survival. \"I hope we're safe now,\" said Lewington. \"I can't stand much more of this! It's bizarre. We've got 54 points and we're still not sure. You can't take anything for granted this season.\" Those words should serve as a warning to Millwall. \"The play-offs are not in our hands at the moment,\" said Wilkins. \"That was our game in hand and if we don't make the play-offs, it will absolutely dent our confidence for the Cup final.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
