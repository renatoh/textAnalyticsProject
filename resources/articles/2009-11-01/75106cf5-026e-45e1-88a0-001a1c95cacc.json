The last time he brought the Decemberists to London from Oregon, the band opened their set with a 20-minute folk-prog-metal epic based on an Irish legend. This time, he dedicates the set's first hour to the band's last album, the folk-prog-metal rock opera, The Hazards of Love. As if that's not off-putting enough, he's brought along Shara Worden and Becky Stark to help out with the singing, and the latter is dressed (and dances) as if she's come straight from an assignation with the wood fairies. The format doesn't play to Meloy's strengths. He's a writer of instantly memorable melodies, but Hazards of Love is lighter on those than his previous work, and playing it straight through means Meloy has no opportunity to practise his legendary charm between songs. The album is full of terrific moments, such as the formation drumming exercise of The Rake's Song, but those moments slide out of focus as the band slides into another lumbering faux-metal riff. A 10-song second set, fortunately, highlights the Decemberists' strengths. The Sporting Life \u2013 a lament to games lesson inadequacy set to a pounding Motown beat \u2013 plays off Meloy's geek-made-good persona. The Engine Driver receives the loudest cheer of the night, and a rambling story about God being so upset with the poor quality of a song fragment called Dracula's Daughter that he wept a single tear that carved the Thames valley makes imaginative leaps that you won't get from, say, La Roux. A beautiful new song played in the encore, January Hymn, offers hope that next time they visit, the Decemberists will play to their strengths, rather than indulging their inner Rick Wakeman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
