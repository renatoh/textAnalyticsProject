The consumer organisation Which? welcomed the changes which are designed to prevent charges which are often difficult to detect. Under the rules traders must ensure that payment surcharges reflect the actual cost of processing the payment. This may explain why tickets for the Rolling Stones concert in Hyde Park on 6 July went on sale on Friday before the new rules came in. The ticket prices were supplemented by a \"recorded delivery\" surcharge of \u00a319 and a further \"delivery charge\" of \u00a35.50 per order. Jo Swinson, the consumer affairs minister, said of the new rules: \"The practice of excessive payment surcharges has been ripping off consumers for far too long. They are fed up of thinking they will be paying a certain price for goods only to find out towards the end of the process that the final price is much higher. \"I am delighted that the ban will stop retailers from cashing in by charging add-on fees that simply do not reflect the real cost of processing the payment. Consumers will be less likely to get nasty surprises as they will have a clearer and more transparent breakdown of what they are paying for.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: \"Over 50,000 people supported our campaign to end rip off surcharges so we're pleased the government is implementing this ban. For it to be effective there must be a tough enforcement regime and companies must play fair and not pass costs on to customers in other ways. \"We will be monitoring the ban closely and want people to tell us about surcharges they think are excessive.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
