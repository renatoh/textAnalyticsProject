The 30-year-old England international winger will become Middlesbrough's first summer signing and the second high-profile departure from Upton Park after Lee Bowyer's move to Newcastle United. The \u00a32m will only make a dent in West Ham's debt and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, Jermain Defoe and Joe Cole are still all expected to go. Les Ferdinand has already had talks with Leicester City. Sinclair, who knows Boro's manager Steve McClaren from the England set-up, was seen as one of the under-achievers in Glenn Roeder's relegated West Ham team. But he now has the chance to recover from his post-World Cup slump and will fill the space on Boro's right side vacated by Geremi. The Cameroon international was on loan from Real Madrid last season and was a success. However, though Middlesbrough had first option to purchase Geremi, they were put off by Real's \u00a37m-minimum valuation. This was considered a high price in the current market but there are pockets of inflation with the arrival at Chelsea of the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. The mere fact that Chelsea expressed an interest in Geremi two days ago has seen his value to Real jump to \u00a311m. Middlesbrough were already in the process of withdrawing from the deal when that happened. \"The midfield area is where we need to improve because we do not have the depth there that is required,\" McClaren said yesterday. \"Last season we got caught out a few times and we must try to make sure that doesn't happen again. \"Our first signing is very important because everything can fall into place after that. The chairman Steve Gibson has done a fantastic job at this club and we have spent very carefully. We don't have a budget here as such - I just ask him if we can have a player if I think one can be brought in to improve the squad and he moves heaven and earth to help out.\" McClaren intimated that another target, Sunderland's Kevin Phillips, may no longer be on Boro's radar. McClaren has recognised strikers in Malcolm Christie, Michael Ricketts, Joseph Job and Massimo Maccarone and presumably would have to move one out before acquiring another. One Sunderland player who has moved is Emerson Thome, who is on trial with Rangers. Fulham last night rejected an offer worth \u00a35m from Everton for their England Under-21 midfielder Sean Davis. The offer, comprised of an initial down payment of \u00a33.5m with further money linked to appearances and honours at Goodison Park, constitutes the extent of David Moyes's summer transfer budget, though the Everton board is believed to be prepared to find extra funds to increase the size of the initial payment. Fulham remain reluctant to lose Davis, 23, though their own precarious financial predicament could eventually force their hand on a player they had initially - and somewhat unrealistically - valued at nearer \u00a37m. The former Wimbledon midfielder Michael Hughes, who spent the whole of last season in limbo after a legal dispute over his registration between the Dons and Birmingham City, is hoping to resume his career with Crystal Palace. The Northern Ireland international went nine months without pay last season having injured his ankle three games into a loan spell at City, with whom he was due to sign a three-year deal if the Blues were promoted to the Premiership. Birmingham later insisted that the clause was invalid because the 31-year-old had failed to complete the loan move."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
