In a letter to the 16 national newspaper editors plus the London Evening Standard, Harman said that a \"balanced team\" including older women was needed to ensure balanced reporting. The letter comes after the government announced in February this year that it had decided not to bring into force the \"dual characteristics\" provision relating to discrimination in the Equality Act 2010. The \"combined discrimination: dual characteristics\" provision of the act, introduced by Harman in Labour's final year in office, allows applicants to bring a discrimination case if they have been treated unfairly on the grounds of two \"protected characteristics\" \u2013 age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Harman, who called on the equalities and women's minister, Maria Miller, to reverse the government's decision on the dual-discrimination provision, said: \"I'm writing to national newspaper editors to ask them to be open about the number of older women working in UK newspapers. We see the world through news and comment in our newspapers so a balanced team which includes older women is needed to report the world as they see it. Equality is not just important in principle \u2013 it is important for the quality of newspaper reporting and comment.\" Harman has established a Labour commission on older women. Its members include Arlene Philips, 70, who was replaced as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing by Alesha Dixon, 34 and Miriam O'Reilly, 56, who successfully sued the BBC for discrimination after she was dropped as a presenter on Countryfile. The commission also includes the Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley. In her letter to the editors, who include the Guardian News and Media editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, Harman asked: \u2022 How many staff journalists does the newspaper employ? How many of these are women? \u2022 How many of the staff journalists you employ are over the age of 50?
