Don't trust him with the vacuuming, says partner", "bodyText": "His job may have been to plug leaks in Downing Street and to counsel the prime minister on UK and foreign policy, but Alastair Campbell has been outed as next to useless when it came to domestic chores. His partner, Fiona Millar, has revealed the former No 10 communications chief managed to break the vacuum cleaner the first time he was asked to clean with it, and had as much interest in domestic jobs as Gordon Brown has in anger management. Millar's candour comes in a piece in the Radio Times to promote a new BBC series examining whether working mothers are able to live the feminist dream. She roots some of her arguments in the lack of willingness of Campbell, her long-term partner and Tony Blair's communications chief, to help out in the home. She wrote about how she came to realise that the \"lofty ideals\" of feminism were being thwarted by practical issues, such as which partner ends up doing the laundry and other household chores. Millar wrote: \"I came to this realisation too late. It was only once my two eldest children had gone to university, and I was researching a book about working mothers, that I began to understand the extent to which my low tolerance of chaos and my inability to give up control of the domestic sphere, combined with my partner Alastair's unwillingness to take responsibility for it, had fatally undermined my attempts to stay on the conventional career ladder.\" She then wrote more about Campbell's preference for sweeping political secrets under the carpet and aversion to housework, adding: \"On reflection, I should have spotted the signs earlier. Even before we had children, Alastair never took any interest in cooking or shopping. \"He 'broke' the vacuum cleaner the first time he was asked to use it \u2013 a well-worn male tactic to avoid being asked again \u2013 and when I once asked him to mow the lawn, he replied that if he'd wanted to mow lawns, he would have become a gardener.\" Millar, a journalist and former adviser to Cherie Blair, wrote: \"After the arrival of the children, things went rapidly downhill. Some estimates suggest the arrival of a new baby trebles the amount of housework. All those meals you once ate out transform into shopping, cooking and washing up. Babies generate mountains of washing, and endless nappies fill up those black bags, which, for me, always trump all else as a reminder of my mother's early warning, when she retrained as a teacher in her early 40s: 'There is no such thing as women's lib. Women just do two jobs.'\" Millar said a solution may be to split the leave parents get from employers when a child is born: \"Many campaigners think the answer is to split maternity/paternity leave into two parts, requiring the second half to be taken (or lost) by the father, thereby establishing different domestic patterns early and possibly encouraging more men to ask for flexible work, which would make it more acceptable.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
