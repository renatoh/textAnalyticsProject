Union was reportedly fired from the show last month after experiencing what was described as racially insensitive situations and, along with fellow judge Julianne Hough, being subjected to \u201cexcessive notes\u201d on their physical appearance. Hough, who also left, has since said she had a \u201cwonderful time\u201d on the show. Tina Tchen, the chief executive of Time\u2019s Up, said Union\u2019s story \u201cfollows a pattern of NBCUniversal protecting the careers of powerful men at the expense of women who speak out\u201d. Tchen, the former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, said: \u201cNot only did Union reportedly endure and witness racist and inappropriate behavior \u2013 including racially insensitive comments and excessive criticism about her physical appearance \u2013 but it also appears she was punished for speaking out: the company labeled her as \u2018difficult\u2019 before ousting her from the show altogether.\u201d \u201cUnion\u2019s experience shows NBCUniversal still has a lot of work to do to change its culture so discrimination, harassment, and retaliation are no longer tolerated at the company.\u2019 Fellow judge Simon Cowell is also executive producer of the show through his Syco Entertainment production company. This year\u2019s finale drew about 10 million viewers, 3 million fewer than last year. A statement from NBCUniversal, Syco and Fremantle, another producer of the show, read: \u201cWe remain committed to ensuring a respectful workplace for all employees and take very seriously any questions about workplace culture.\u201d It added: \u201cWe are working with Ms Union through her representatives to hear more about her concerns, following which we will take whatever next steps may be appropriate.\u201d Union, 47, also received support from fellow actor Eva Longoria, who wrote on Instagram that Union was treated in an \u201cunacceptable\u201d way. She wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s time for NBCUniversal to commit to long-term, concrete action to fix its toxic workplace culture and ensure safety and equity for all its workers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
