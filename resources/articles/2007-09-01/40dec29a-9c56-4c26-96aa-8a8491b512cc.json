The credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday warned UK mortgage holders who are soon to come off fixed-rate mortgages to expect a \"payment shock\" - particularly if they have a poor credit history and fall into the so-called sub-prime group. \"Borrowers who took out two-year fixed-rate mortgages from late 2005 are facing one of the largest payment shocks witnessed since the 1990s, even if they are able to refinance,\" it said. The problems are expected to hit sub-prime borrowers hardest because the mortgage companies that provide those loans have always been much more reliant on the money markets. As they are forced to pay more, their borrower may find that loans offered two years ago are no longer available or are prohibitively expensive. Those with perfect credit histories will be less affected but may still see rates rise if the market turmoil persists. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has calculated that about 2m fixed-rate mortgages - about 17% of the total British market - will be ending before the end of 2008. Anyone seeking to renew their borrowings will have to do so at \"significantly higher\" rates, the report warned. Homeowners were already feeling the heat before the credit crunch that brought the near collapse of Northern Rock. The Bank of England has increased rates five times since August last year. The report suggests that if the credit crunch continues, sub-prime borrowers could easily see their mortgage costs rise by 26%, which would add an average of \u00a3167 to month payments on a \u00a385,000 loan. If the market worsens even further, the report concluded that borrowers with the worst credit histories, who took out cheaper, interest-only mortgages, could see their mortgage payments rise by as much as 60%, a rate that would force many into substantial arrears. A CML spokeswoman said the payment rises would be \"manageable\" for most borrowers, although she conceded that the effects could be considerable for the 5% of mortgage applicants who are considered sub-prime. \"Some lenders are putting in place arrangements to ensure that borrowers are alerted early,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
