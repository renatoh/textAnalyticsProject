The new deal will see ITV continuing to broadcast 16 live FA Cup matches per season, as well as England's home qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup and home and away friendlies. ITV will also show the Community Shield live and broadcast six live matches from the FA Youth Cup on ITV4. ITV is believed to be paying around \u00a390m for the two-year deal, a saving of around 35% on its existing contract. ITV's director of television, Peter Fincham, said: \"The FA Cup and England internationals are events with huge resonance and appeal for our viewers. I'm delighted that we are extending our partnership with the FA and that ITV1 will continue to be the home of live football on free-to-air television.\" Owen Gibson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
