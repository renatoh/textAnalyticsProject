Any fun things we should be taking with us? How about the Mathmos Tumbler Faze Light? The folk that re-introduced retro-styled Lava lamps have now designed a sort of brick light which is highly portable and emits ever-changing coloured mood lighting. It works well as a novel nightlight - ideal for comforting nervous children when the family is living under canvas. Tell me more. It is rechargeable and about the size of a standard house brick but made from opaque glass. To switch on, turn it on its side and the light slowly changes by running through its spectrum of 18 colours.The speed with which the muted coloured lights change depends on which side it stands. One way it runs through all the colours in about half a minute, turn it another and they change more slowly. How is it operated - presumably there is a switch on the side? There's no on/off switch. Instead, the light is off when placed on its other end with a small splash-resistant socket uppermost. The mains charger (included) plugs into the small socket to recharge. It takes around 12 hours to charge fully and can then run non-stop for six hours. Where do I get one? The Mathmos Tumbler Faze Light costs \u00a349.95, plus p&amp;p, from SF Cody (01993 770457).
