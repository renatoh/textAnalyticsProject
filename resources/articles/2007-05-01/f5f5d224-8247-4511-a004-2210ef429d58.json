Sayers, 24, signalled a dramatic change in her own fortunes with a javelin throw of 65.05metres, a British record and the furthest distance in the world this year. \"It was a shock, but not a great shock,\" said Sayers, a former student at Loughborough. \"But if I repeat this display at the World Championships in Osaka in August then I would win a medal.\" Sayers had been based in Loughborough until September when she moved home to Cambridge and began to be coached by Mark Roberson, a former Great Britain international. \"He spotted many things wrong with my technique,\" said Sayers, who broke the old British best of 64.87m, held by Kelly Morgan since 2002. Jason Gardener will decide on his future after the World championship trials in July despite running a fine first leg as England's men won the 4x100m relay yesterday. \"I'm going to see how the next few weeks go because I don't want to be around to make up the numbers,\" said Gardener, who has talked about retirement since winning the European Indoor 60m title for the third time in March. Jessica Ennis, the British heptathlete who is top of the world rankings, was impressive again yesterday as she won the 100m hurdles in 13.19sec and threw Personal best of 37.05m in the javelin. On the road yesterday Jo Pavey won the Great Manchester Run in 37min 47sec, earning victory in the 10km race by only one second from the Hungarian Aniko Kalovics. Micah Hogu of Kenya won the men's event in 27.71, where Mo Farah was third in 28.07."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
