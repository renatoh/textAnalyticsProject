The court of appeals ruling is a victory for Osceola township, a small mid-Michigan town that blocked Nestl\u00e9 from building a pumping station that doesn\u2019t comply with its zoning laws. But the case could also throw a wrench in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s attempts to privatize water around the country. If it is to carry out such plans, then it will need to be legally recognized as a public water source that provides an essential public service. The Michigan environmental attorney Jim Olson, who did not represent Osceola township but has previously battled Nestl\u00e9 in court, said any claim that the Swiss multinational is a public water utility \u201cis ludicrous\u201d. \u201cWhat this lays bare is the extent to which private water marketers like Nestl\u00e9, and others like them, go [in] their attempts to privatize sovereign public water, public water services, and the land and communities they impact,\u201d Olson said. The ruling, made on Tuesday, could also lead state environmental regulators to reconsider permits that allow Nestl\u00e9 to pump water in Michigan. The Osceola case stems from Nestle\u2019s attempt to increase the amount of water it pulls from a controversial wellhead in nearby Evart from about 250 gallons per minute to 400 gallons per minute. It needs to build the pump in a children\u2019s campground in Osceola township to transport the increased load via a pipe system. The township in 2017 rejected the plans based on its zoning laws, and Nestl\u00e9 subsequently sued. A lower court wrote in late 2017 that water was essential for life and bottling water was an \u201cessential public service\u201d that met a demand, which trumped Osceola township\u2019s zoning laws. However, a three-judge panel in the appellate court reversed the decision. The appellate judges acknowledged that water was \u201cessential to life\u201d, but wrote that the context in which water is sold also had to be considered. Marketing bottled water in an area where tap water is available is unessential. \u201cThe circuit court\u2019s conclusion that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] commercial water bottling operation is an \u2018essential public service\u2019 is clearly erroneous,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cOther than in areas with no other source of water, bottled water is not essential.\u201d The court noted that infrastructure that provides essential public services included electrical substations, sewage facilities or other similar structures. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s pumping station does not fit in that category. The judges also disagreed with Nestle\u2019s argument that it represented a \u201cpublic water supply\u201d. They said state law \u201cunambiguously\u201d implies public water supplies are \u201cconveyed to a site through pipes\u201d while nonessential water is provided in bottles. \u201cWe conclude that [Nestl\u00e9\u2019s] proposed booster-pump facility is not a \u2018public water supply\u2019 under [Michigan law],\u201d the court wrote. Osceola township\u2019s attorney, William Fahey, told the Guardian it was clear that Nestle\u2019s bottling operation \u201cis a commercial purpose\u201d and the pump was prohibited by the township\u2019s zoning laws. He said Nestl\u00e9 could appeal to the Michigan supreme court, or it could attempt to build the pump elsewhere in the township. In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s natural resource manager, Arlene Anderson-Vincent, said the company believes \u201cthe plan we proposed met the Township\u2019s site plan and special land use standards\u201d. \u201cWe will evaluate our possible next steps in the legal process,\u201d she said. The court\u2019s determination could also have an impact on the state permit that allows Nestl\u00e9 to increase its extraction load to 400 gallons per minute. The Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE) issued the permit in part because it determined Nestl\u00e9 provided an essential public service and was not damaging the local water table. Several Native American tribes and the environmental attorney Ross Hammersley are challenging the permit in state administrative court. Hammersley told the Guardian the appellate court finding that Nestl\u00e9 is not a public water source could help in his case, as could remarks about the company\u2019s impact on the water table. \u201c[Nestl\u00e9] extracting water and sending it to other places where it cannot return to the water table, and, critically, doing so faster than the aquifer can replenish, is an \u2018irretrievable\u2019 depletion unless the pumping is reduced or halted,\u201d the judges wrote. The administrative court\u2019s ruling is expected early next year, but Olson already views the latest decision as a \u201chuge victory\u201d. \u201cIn the context of the larger question, \u2018Who owns the water?\u2019 \u2013 in this round, the state and public do, because selling containerized water for profit is simply private, not public,\u201d Olson said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
