The RAC Foundation is calling for a one-year minimum learning period \u2013 during which candidates would have to gain experience of driving in darkness and in different conditions. The plan would also bring in restrictions on carrying passengers for a year after the test and a probationary licence for the first two years. Similar measures already exist in Northern Ireland, where the assembly is looking to further tighten the licensing scheme in the autumn. Young drivers are three times more likely to die on Britain's roads than the average licence-holder, with 1,552 motorists in the 17-24 age range killed or seriously injured in 2011, the thinktank found. One in five young drivers has an accident in the first six months after passing the test. The US and Australia have had a sharp drop in casualties after placing extra conditions on new drivers. Prof Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \"Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs. \"Yet, as a society, we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage. If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry. \"Our research shows that putting certain restrictions on young drivers allows them to rapidly build up live-saving experience in the safest possible way. \"Putting a firm number on casualty reduction is hard but the evidence suggests a full package of measures could reduce fatalities by anything up to 60%.\" Stephen Hammond, the road safety minister, said: \"Improving young drivers' safety is a priority for us \u2013 that is why we have already improved the driving test so that it better reflects real-life conditions on the road, rather than focusing on specific manoeuvres. \"We are also considering a range of options to ensure learners and newly qualified drivers are properly prepared for the road and we will publish our proposals later in the year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
