Cardiff have put their chequebook away, victim of the financial uncertainty besetting Welsh rugby. They start their Heineken Cup campaign at home to Biarritz this evening expected to be also-rans in the tournament which in past seasons they have talked grandly of winning. Expectations, like Cardiff's expenditure, have dropped. They lost the Wales second rower Craig Quinnell to Saracens in the summer because they were unable to match the extra \u00a340,000 a year salary he had been offered, while they could not afford to get involved in a bidding war with Harlequins for former South Africa captain Andre Vos. \"Quins were offering virtually double what we were,\" said the Cardiff manager Derwyn Jones, the club's former international lock who joined the management team three months ago. \"Vos did not have a choice to make, but there are other clubs in Wales offering players large sums of money who do not receive the insults we did. Why not?\" There is a very real danger that the predator could turn prey. Cardiff have a back division as exciting as any in Europe and they are at their most dangerous when opponents are on the attack, able to break out of defence with bewildering speed. Four players, the fly-half Iestyn Harris, the centre Jamie Robinson, the wing Craig Morgan and the full-back Rhys Williams, are the best players in their positions in Wales on form this season, but only Harris is tied to Cardiff in the long-term. The danger to Cardiff is twofold: first there is the uncertainty surrounding the future of the professional game in Wales with the Welsh Rugby Union actively considering a proposal to halve the number of professional sides in the country next season. The second is money: all the Welsh clubs have struggled financially this season because the WRU has had problems handing over its monthly payments due to the delay in the Six Nations television contract. \"We have a long-term strategy based on keeping a number of core players here,\" said Jones. \"We have made a lot of investment at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-17 level and the emphasis is on rearing our own players, but you need experience. We are having to compete with richer English clubs, but what we have here is a team spirit as strong as that when I played here in the 90s.\" This will be Cardiff coach David Young's first season in charge after the departure of the club's rugby director Rudy Joubert in the summer. \"Dai is a strong character who commands respect,\" said Jones. \"He knows what he wants and the Heineken Cup gives us the chance to see where we are at.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
