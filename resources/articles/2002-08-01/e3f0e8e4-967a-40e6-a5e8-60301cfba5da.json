Barthez was a notable absentee as Sir Alex Ferguson's players arrived in Hungary for tonight's Champions League qualifier against Zalaegerszegi, with Roy Carroll handed the chance for his longest run in the team since joining the club from Wigan Athletic. Ferguson hopes that Barthez could be back \"within three weeks\" but he is already seeking another goalkeeper before the transfer deadline of August 31. \"If Barthez were not to make a quick recovery, I would have to think about that,\" he said. Raimond van der Gouw and Paul Rachubka both left Old Trafford over the summer and Ben Williams, a 19-year-old Mancunian, is now the club's third-choice goalkeeper. He will be on the substitutes' bench for a United side with injury problems in defence too. John O'Shea will replace Rio Ferdinand, whose twisted ankle also makes him highly unlikely to figure in United's first Premiership match of the season. And Gary Neville will be out for another month at least with the broken bone that ruled him out of the World Cup. Ferguson admitted that he \"hardly knew anything\" about United's opponents, who won the Hungarian title for the first time last season, having never previously finished in the top two in their 82-year history. Zalaegerszegi (probable, 4-4-2): Ilic; Csoka, Urban, Budisa, Szamosi; Babati, Ljubojevic, Vincze, Egressy; Farago, Kenesei. Manchester United (probable, 4-4-2): Carroll; P Neville, O'Shea, Blanc, Silvestre; Beckham, Keane, Veron, Giggs; Solskjaer, Van Nistelrooy. Referee : W Stark (Germany)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
