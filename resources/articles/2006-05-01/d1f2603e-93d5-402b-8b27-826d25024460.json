Consolidation is a historical fact, goes the argument, and the big four have more than 70% of the grocery market and rising. Tesco and Sainsbury's own hundreds of high street convenience stores and won't be volunteering to hand them back. And, when yet another inquiry is over, Britain will still have a planning regime that looks very like the current one. All these points are powerful, but they don't really take account of the fact that the supermarkets themselves are divided on the issue of planning. To Tesco's intense annoyance, Asda and Sainsbury's have been complaining that the market leader's huge bank of undeveloped land is a major competitive advantage. The losers in the great supermarket scrap are, of course, talking up their own interests, but the industry's lack of united front is what makes this competition inquiry different from its predecessors. It is, for the first time, just about conceivable that supermarkets could be forced to sell plots of land to rivals, or even to industry newcomers. What everybody seems to have missed is a parallel drawn by John Fingleton, the OFT chief executive. Could a would-be Ryanair of the supermarket scene get a foothold, he once asked, implying it would currently be impossible. Whether a Ryanair-style supermarket is really desirable is another matter (would the shoppers have to bring their own trollies?), but the airline analogy gives a flavour of the radical nature and scale of the OFT's thinking. There is no guarantee that the commission will share Mr Fingleton's vision, but the supermarkets, especially Tesco, do not appear to be as complacent as the City. Today Tesco will tell us how it plans to be a \"good neighbour\", a charm offensive that can only mean one thing: it smells potential trouble ahead. Pit bull bites Man Lawsuits are never friendly, but the acrimony in the fight between Man Financial and Clark Hodgson, the receiver to failed Philadelphia Alternative Asset Management (PAAM) hedge fund, is something else. The receiver has taken the nuclear option of using anti-racketeering legislation in filing his case. Man, broker to PAAM, reckons that is a publicity stunt and typical of Mr Hodgson's blunt and aggressive style. The court, of course, will settle the affair. Indeed, one of the first decisions it will have to make is whether legislation designed to combat organised crime is really appropriate when dealing with a Cayman Islands hedge fund. It appears to be fresh legal ground, even for litigation-happy America. But it's not difficult to work out why this case has become so charged. PAAM was certainly obscure, but some big cheeses in the financial world either invested directly or were acting on behalf of clients. As is usual with hedge funds, the users prefer the box marked \"no publicity\" (why do you think PAAM was in the Caymans?), but a few names have dribbled out in court documents. Bank of America acted as custodian for some PAAM investors, as did French banks BNP and SocGen. Money from the Time Warner family fortune also appears to have been invested. These folk may not say much in public, but we can be sure they are watching every step of this case. Having denounced Mr Hodgson as a scurrilous sensationalist, nothing less than a comprehensive and outright victory will now be acceptable for Man Group. Cutting cable Nobody, not even the Communications Workers Union, can really be surprised at the number of job cuts announced by NTL yesterday - 6,000, or more than a third of the workforce - after the merger with Telewest. They've been on the cards since the day the cable guys combined. The shake-up is nevertheless a mammoth management task, and underlines what a long way the combo has to travel before it is capable of living up to its promise to take chunks out of BT, Sky and everybody else who wants to join the fun in broadband land. Customer service, and not just slick technology, is likely to be a key measure that separates winners and losers, and a big round of job losses is not an ideal way to start life. NTL's management can only deal with what they've inherited, but they are still starting a long way behind the rest of the field. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
