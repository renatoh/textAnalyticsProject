What is more unusual is that in this case the person feeling intimidated happens to be a hooded youth and the perpetrator is Ann Widdecombe, Conservative MP turned documentary maker. \"She came here with her TV cameras and entourage and hounded us down,\" says Jojo Oliveira, 18, recounting his experience of coming face-to-face with Widdecombe as she filmed her documentary, Ann Widdecombe v The Hoodies, aired in February on ITV1. \"She was practically running after us down alleys. It was intimidating.\" After being labelled \"thugs\" and their home \"a dump\" by Widdecombe, teenagers on the north London estate are fighting back with their own documentary, posted on YouTube. \"We are so tired of being misrepresented, we wanted to strike back and say 'we're not who you think we are',\" says Oliveira. \"So we decided to talk back.\" Produced by film-maker Michelle Golding and funded by Arsenal Positive Futures programme, which runs sports initiatives on Andover estate where Oliveira lives, the youngsters say the film is an attempt to set the record straight. \"Of course our estate has got problems - which hasn't? - but that documentary didn't show any of the positive stuff that young people bring,\" Oliveira says. \"They showed adults doing normal everyday activities, but each time they showed young people it was in the dead of night and we were hanging around in doorways. A lot of people in the film weren't even from Andover.\" The YouTube documentary emphasises the positive stories on the estate, showing the work of local youth workers and the close friendships forged between residents. According to a local newspaper, Widdecombe is refusing to watch the film, but Oliveira and his friends are hoping as many people as possible will watch it and see a different side of Andover. \"We thought it was time we got to tell our own story,\" he says. \"Because if we don't, who will?\" \u00b7 Watch Beyond the Hoodie at youtube.com \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
