There's practically no abuse we won't commit given the right encouragement, as psychologists regularly demonstrate. In 1971, for example, Professor Philip Zimbardo set up a mock jail at California's Stanford university, with students assuming the roles of prisoners and guards. \"In only a few days,\" Zimbardo later noted, \"our guards became sadistic and our prisoners became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress.\" The prof was so shocked by what went on that he abandoned the experiment. Find out more as Claudia Hammond returns with a new series of Mind Changers (11am, Radio 4). Fiction, however, is still occasionally stranger than fact. The Sensitive (2.15pm, Radio 4) is Alastair Jessiman's second play about a quiet young man who just happens to have paranormal powers that help him to solve difficult police investigations. Today he uncovers unsettling connections between a young boy's murder and the death of his own uncle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
