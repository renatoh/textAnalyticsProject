Hotter, drier, but remarkably short of cacti", "bodyText": "This year's Chelsea Flower Show will feature hundreds of gardens, and one greenhouse effect. Alongside the pavilions, water features, canopies, mosaic paths and rammed earth walls on display by the banks of the Thames next week, the show's organisers, the Royal Horticultural Society, have made climate change a key theme. From using willow as biofuel, to adapting flower gardens, a series of exhibits will tackle how to make a garden grow in a changing climate. Exhibitor Andrew Birkett, a horticulture student at Writtle College, Chelmsford, has designed a garden suitable for Essex, the driest county, in the year 2050. \"We've focused on plants and flowers that people actually want in their gardens, not things like cacti and gravel,\" he said. \"People like cottage gardens now and they will in the future.\" In Birkett's garden rainwater is stored in an underground tank to help beat hosepipe bans which are expected to become more frequent as summer rains dry up. Birkett believes many plants currently classed as tender perennials because they rarely survive the UK winter, for example purple- and white-petalled heliotrope and the white daisy, would become true perennials, and flower each spring. Other houseplants and plants currently suited to conservatories could also be regular features outside. Summer droughts and floods in quick succession in recent years have given gardeners a glimpse of the likely future in a warmer world, and many have responded with increased focus on sustainability, water conservation and adaptability. Scientists at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit are at Chelsea, and have also created a garden as it might be in 2050. The researchers say it shows the dramatic impact that changes in climate will have on plants that will be suitable for our gardens, and some of the changes in gardening methods that will be needed to cope with climate change. Saffron O'Neill, one of the garden's designers, said: \"The 2050 gardener will be working with higher temperatures and more intense rainfall. The milder weather will mean fewer frosts and more garden pests.\" They have designed three distinct garden areas. The first is a typical 1950s cottage garden with delphiniums, rhododendrons, lupins and azaleas. The team says: \"The simplicity of this garden is certain to conjure up memories of a childhood idyll, and provides a stark contrast to the future visions in the two adjoining sections.\" The two concepts for 2050 are divided into low emission and high emission scenarios, depending on how the world acts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Gardeners could adapt by selecting plants that prefer a longer growing season, higher average temperatures and less soil moisture. Such plants may currently be grown in sheltered positions within the UK but will survive more generally in future. The 2050 high emissions garden assumes no curb on global greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting climate change will produce more extreme weather, with increasing likelihood of storm damage and longer, more frequent droughts. Gardeners will need to consider growing plants less familiar to the UK, such as bougainvillea, hardier cacti and succulents such as aloe and the Italian cypress, which can tolerate high temperatures and less rainfall. The government's UK Climate Impact Programme is also promoting the effects global warming will have in the garden. Phil Woolas, the environment minister, said: \"We are a nation of gardeners and nothing is making people realise the reality of climate change more than the changes that we are seeing in our gardens. All gardeners need to think about how we manage and store water. We need to think about how our demand for the perfect lawn or the most impressive flower bed affects our environment.\" Tuesday's opening of the show follows a row triggered by remarks made by Rachel de Thame, a presenter of the BBC show Gardeners' World. De Thame said formal training was not necessary to design a garden for the show, and that an eye for design was more important. \"Either you have an idea about how things should look as regards proportion and shape or you don't,\" she said. \"It is something that can be coaxed out but really it is innate.\" Peter Thomas, the chairman of the Society of Garden Designers, countered: \"Perhaps you can present a television programme on plant care without knowing about plants by reading a script. But it's a ludicrous idea that you can design a garden without specialist knowledge and understanding of the material required.\" \u00b7 The RHS Chelsea Flower show runs from May 20-24 at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea, south-west London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
