The cricket-loving mathematical gurus need to come up with some more formulae. Often we conclude that so-and-so's runs should count double because they have been scored on a dicey pitch in a taut situation. But in circumstances like these in Trinidad and the ones experienced in Barbados, the value of the batsmen's runs should be halved or reduced by whatever quotient Mr D and Mr L come up with. Once the circus left Jamaica this series has been an exercise in boosting the old batting average to guard against the famine that inevitably follows the harvest. Ian Bell, dropped after the first Test, must be gnashing his teeth. So far there have been 16 centuries and four five-wicket hauls, which gives an indication of the imbalance between bat and ball. The list of centurions is too long to name, though it is an oddity that Kevin Pietersen is not yet among them. The successful bowlers are Stuart Broad and Jerome Taylor, who both had five-wicket hauls in Jamaica, and Graeme Swann, who took 5-57 in Antigua and 5-165 in Barbados. No wonder Swann has been so perky on this tour but that perkiness has been punctured in Trinidad, where the exasperation of all the English bowlers has become ever more evident. Last night three of them, Broad, Amjad Khan and Monty Panesar were up before the match referee, Alan Hurst. Their best bet was that Hurst, an ex-opening bowler for Australia, would understand the mitigating circumstances. The pitches out here have been torture chambers for bowlers. Swann just about managed to avoid entering the referee's office. Like any canny spin bowler \u2013 and despite his exuberance and wisecracking, Swann possesses canniness \u2013 he will remember what he perceives as the injustices. He had vigorous but unsuccessful appeals against Chris Gayle and Ryan Hinds at the beginning and end of the West Indies innings and on each occasion the batsman who survived promptly whacked him for six. A nasty pattern was emerging. Moreover, the non-dismissal of Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 92 would have tested the phlegm of the most even-tempered off-spinner \u2013 and bear in mind off-spinners are equable souls compared with all those highly-strung left-arm spinners. Swann had been toiling for a day or more with no reward. He pitches the perfect off-break; Chanderpaul drives; Matt Prior takes; Swann appeals vigorously; Harper, to the bowler's immense relief raises a finger, and there is a moment of celebration. Now Chanderpaul requests the referral and umpire Aleem Dar asks for replays from every possible angle. Eventually, Chanderpaul is reprieved and the arguments over the referral system resume yet again. Could Aleem Dar prove that Harper had got it wrong? He may have argued that he could see Chanderpaul's bat hit his boot at the same time that the ball was passing the outside edge. This could explain the noise that Harper evidently heard. There was no visible evidence of ball touching bat. Forensic debates now began about what was proof and what was speculation; the pursuit of the truth became secondary. Forget Messrs Duckworth and Lewis for a moment, call for Michael Mansfield QC. Call for Miss Marple. The referral system was in another tangle. Umpire Dar had a nasty dilemma. The regulations appeared to be driving him to endorse a decision that his instincts told him was wrong since there was an absence of proof. In this instance it seems he followed those instincts. So Swann was denied. Afterwards Swann did his best to remain sanguine and, inevitably, he even tried the odd wisecrack. \"It's always hard in 40 degrees. With the Digicel Girls dancing around 30 yards away, you know where you would rather be. We have toiled hard on this tour without anything to show for it,\" he said. \"It would be nice if the pitch broke up on the last day. Hopefully that will happen \u2013 but I don't think it will.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
