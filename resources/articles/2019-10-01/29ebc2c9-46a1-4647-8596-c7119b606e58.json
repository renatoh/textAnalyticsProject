But Jacqui Lambie, the senator, has grown up. \u201cYou know, you just sort of \u2013 as a woman, you\u2019ve got to be able to have confidence in yourself and back yourself, and I just feel that\u2019s where I am,\u201d Lambie says, when reflecting on her second chance in the parliament. \u201cHaving that 20 months out and having to go right back to scratch, and having to survive again and having to do TV shows and stuff like that ... And not knowing whether or not I had, you know, I would make it back in \u2013 I\u2019ll say, I certainly don\u2019t think it hurt me.\u201d She will need that self-possession to sustain her over what will be a difficult month as she contemplates what she will do on the medevac regime. All eyes are on her, as she alone will determine whether it stays or goes. Lambie didn\u2019t so much burst on to the political scene, as erupt, when she first entered parliament as one of Clive Palmer\u2019s senators in July 2014. By November of that year, she had spectacularly split with her former leader, sitting as an independent, before being re-elected under her own name in 2016. But in November 2017, a conversation with her Scottish-born father about the section 44 issues plaguing the parliament made it very clear she would become the next casualty. \u201cAm I gone?\u201d she asked him. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yes sweetie, you\u2019re gone. I think we\u2019re gone.\u2019\u201d And she was. Until May 2019, when Tasmania sent her back to the Senate. But the woman who made headlines for outlining her preferred attributes in potential romantic partners, openness, and molten outbursts in the Senate, returned to Canberra a different operator to the one who first came in, draped in a bright yellow scarf. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was get the balance of power, right?\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was telling Tasmania \u2013 give Tasmania the balance of power \u2026 because I need to deliver some money down there.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve realised you should be careful what you ask for, because when you have that balance of power, you\u2019re pulling your bloody hair out, you know? It\u2019s like: \u2018Oh my God. This decision is on me? Really? Great.\u2019 \u201cWell, it\u2019s not on me, it is actually on Tasmania. I don\u2019t run under a flag, my name is Jacqui Lambie, I\u2019m there for the Tasmanian people. \u201cBut all that experience, going from a wrecking ball to having to learn really quickly around Clive Palmer, to leaving him and then having the 20 months on the outside actually set me up to be a much better person this time around.\u201d Lambie isn\u2019t the only one noticing changes. Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, says Lambie \u201chas been getting more and more experienced\u201d in dealing with the \u201csignificant policy and political pressures\u201d which come with sitting as a crossbench senator. \u201cA lot of people have underestimated Jacqui \u2013 though I think that\u2019s starting to change,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always found Jacqui to be a person of great consistency and integrity. \u201cShe reminds me of a lot of the women I\u2019ve worked with in the labour movement, in the way she is completely unpretentious and refuses to be intimidated. \u201cThe way she came back from a difficult situation and won a Senate seat in her own right demonstrates that. \u201cLots of independents have been great at grabbing the spotlight but few have been as genuinely dedicated to representing their constituents.\u201d Mathias Cormann, who has led negotiations with Lambie on behalf of the government, says her passions \u2013 Tasmania, first and foremost, as well as veterans\u2019 affairs, the issue which brought her to politics \u2013 remain clear. \u201cSenator Lambie is a straight shooter,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are never left in any doubt about her views on any issues she feels strongly about.\u201d Centre Alliance has a loose working arrangement with Lambie and her office when it comes to issues they agree on. Rex Patrick says he has seen a \u201cmuch wiser\u201d Lambie return to the crossbench. \u201cIn the first three days of the 46th parliament she got more for Tasmania than she did in the entire 45th,\u201d he says. \u201cShe could bow out tomorrow and still be a winner. \u201cBut she\u2019s not bowing out. She\u2019s here for the long term. She\u2019s \u2013 mostly \u2013 controlling her normally wild passion for Tasmania constituent issues and utilising her leverage well.\u201d Lambie says Wong would send her text messages during her time in the political wilderness checking in, as would Katy Gallagher, who knew, intimately, what it felt like. Eric Abetz would stop and have a chat when they came across each other at events, while former South Australian senator Nick Xenophon repeatedly encouraged her to return to politics. Her first test as a returned senator came soon after the 46th parliament was convened. With Labor still deliberating on its position, the government headed to Lambie to secure her vote for its tax package. By the time Labor had resolved to support the package in its entirety, Lambie had already decided to back the package in exchange for the federal government forgiving a loan it had made to Tasmania for social housing. But Lambie refused to move forward until she knew where the state government would be spending the funds. \u201cI wanted to make sure that \u2026 the state government didn\u2019t remove any of the money they were putting into housing, making sure that we didn\u2019t lose any GST. I have to look at all of that sort of stuff. It\u2019s not just saying, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s the cash\u2019. No, no, no, no. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s one thing I learned from Andrew Wilkie, when he did the Royal Hobart hospital, he said the worst thing I did was I didn\u2019t target where that cash was going. And I should have had a much bigger say.\u201d She says learning from people like Wilkie has made a significant difference this time round, and she\u2019s determined to get the best deal possible, even it means taking her time. \u201cIf I\u2019m not sure, if I think I can make that deal better, \u2026 then if it takes me a little bit longer to be able to get that solution, then I am going to take my time, and I am going to be banging that door down, until I get what needs to be done.\u201d Which brings Lambie to the one topic she won\u2019t talk about in detail and the one issue everyone wants to hear about \u2013 medevac. Lambie\u2019s vote will decide the fate of the medical evacuation laws the crossbench in the previous parliament were instrumental in passing. Lambie has spent the past month talking to doctors, refugee advocates, legal experts, national security experts, members of both major parties, the Greens and the crossbench, home affairs officials, and the government. She\u2019s asked those she comes across when out in the community what they think. She will spend the weekend reading the Senate committee report into the legislation, recommending it be repealed, and the three dissenting reports recommending it stay. She will re-read the submissions to the inquiry, and she will spend the next three weeks ahead of the next sitting week, continuing to talk to as many people as she can. The one thing she won\u2019t do is have any negotiations in the media. She said she considers the vote to be one for her conscience, not horse trading, and that there is nothing anyone can offer for her vote. It sits heavily. For the first time in the interview, Lambie looks uncomfortable. \u201cI think any decision over humanity is probably one of the biggest decisions [you\u2019ll make],\u201d she says. The Lambie who first came to the Senate would have allowed her unfiltered thoughts on policy to spill out her mouth. But not everything has changed. She still runs hot, and she still calls out her Senate colleagues when angry at a decision. And she\u2019s still most comfortable outside the chamber. Committee meetings mean her weekend will be spent in Canberra, so she took the opportunity to head to a northern suburbs football oval, where Tasmania was playing New South Wales in the police football championships. She\u2019s asked to speak to the Tasmanian team in the sheds, where she is asked if she will put a carton on their victory. \u201cA carton? I\u2019ll put the whole bloody bar on,\u201d she says, to instant cheers. \u201cShe\u2019s got my vote,\u201d a player yells. She walks out, where a NSW player asks if she\u2019s going for Tasmania. \u201cOf course I am, mate,\u201d she lobs back. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to kick your arse.\u201d As she walks away, he turns to his mate and says \u201cahhhh, Ms Lambie, hey? I love it.\u201d And she loves it too. Even if the road to this point has been bumpy, and the road ahead remains uncharted. \u201cI think that I\u2019ve grown up \u201d she says. \u201cI look at all those new faces in the Senate and think \u2018oh my God, I feel bloody old\u2019, they\u2019re so young some of them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
