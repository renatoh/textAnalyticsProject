This CD features that fine former Blakey and Eddie Palmieri saxist Donald \"Duck\" Harrison, and a regular playing partner since the 1980s, pianist Mulgrew Miller. Although the funky streetbeat episodes reveal an eye on the wider marketplace, there are no cliches here. The grooves are tight whilst the blowing is loose (and stretched by some probing themes and arrangements), and Harrison shows a typical New Orleans player's instinct for balancing the populist and the musical. Mulgrew Miller is superb, and Harrison's 18-year-old trumpet-playing nephew Christian Scott has some heated moments, though he takes a muted, rather distant approach to a brooding Summertime. Harrison explodes into his best incandescent style on the straighter-swinging pieces in the second half - like the later part of Wayne Shorter's Oriental Folk Song and the boiling, riff-themed Nouveau Swing, where the rhythm section cooks like the Jazz Messengers of old. A hip-hop Caravan is more a novelty than necessity, but it's expert postbop with a mostly successful contemporary spin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
