He had no enemies but those he chose in the ring \u2013 and that enmity lasted only until the final bell, whoever won. In a professional career that started after his demob from National Service in 1954 and ended in 1971 when Britain embraced decimalisation Cooper was twice named sports personality of the year and reigned longer than anyone else as British heavyweight champion. He was knighted in 2000. Yet he could not fulfil the national hunger for a world heavyweight champion. In truth, in an era of supreme quality, he was not quite good enough but nobody doubted his desire or his endeavour. He was loved none the less. His services to boxing went beyond his titles and victories, a relatively modest 40 among 55 contests. His appeal was his guileless mien and a left hook that terrified opponents two and three stones bigger than him almost as much as his easily sliced eyebrows shocked sensitive onlookers. Cooper had no middle name (nor did his twin brother, George) and, as he moved through a sporting life in post-war Britain that took him from south London to Buckingham Palace and many interesting places along the way, he embroidered the fight game with a dignity it did not always deserve. When Sir Henry's death was announced late on Sunday evening, sadness rippled not just through his sport but in the hearts of anyone who yearned for the uncomplicated values of his time and place. The news led all bulletins. There might be a handful of British sporting personalities whose passing would be regarded with similar reverence. Current celebrities of an entirely different kind, from the WBA champion David Haye to the footballer Wayne Rooney, raced to their twitter buttons to register their sympathies. Barry McGuigan, the former world featherweight champion who got to know him well on the golf courses of Kent, described him as \"a very fine golfer and a very, very lovely human being\". The Sun's long-time boxing correspondent, Colin Hart, who knew him better than most, said, \"He was popular from Land's End to John O'Groats.\" And nearly everyone canvassed agreed: nobody had a bad thing to say about Our 'Enry. There was nothing bad to say, of course, because Cooper came from that working-class tradition of upright behaviour and manners \u2013 outside the ring at least. As Cooper would admit, when it came to fighting, he could rough it up with the best of them. But it was his quiet nobility and unvarnished honesty that ensured he would forever be elevated beyond his deeds. He was not, as his excellent biographer, Robert Edwards, maintained in 2002, \"arguably Britain's greatest ever heavyweight\", although there was an almost universal urge to embrace that sentiment. However, he was certainly a formidable presence in the ring, whose fists, notably his crisp, quick left, held enough power to neutralise the swagger of Cassius Clay just long enough to excite the belief of British fans at Wembley Arena in 1963 that here, at last, was the champion who would deliver them their heavyweight dream. Clay, fighting for the last time under that name, survived through a mix of his own courage and skulduggery by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, who split his glove between the fourth and fifth rounds to give him a few seconds' extra respite. When they resumed, Henry's paper-thin brows let him down again and were slashed open much more spectacularly than had been Clay's gloves. Clay, invariably more generous in victory than beforehand, allegedly told him, \"You hit me so hard it hurt my relatives in Africa.\" Perhaps he did but the sentiment was clear enough anyway. In his next fight, as Muhammad Ali, he took Sonny Liston's world title world title. But it would take a major leap of faith to declare that Cooper could have done to Liston what Ali did. When he got his title shot against Ali, at Highbury in 1966, the result was the same, only without the frisson of excitement, and Cooper was the first to admit his moment had already come and gone in a crimson blur. Cooper had much to be proud of. He was British, Commonwealth and European champion at various stages and, well into retirement, he maintained he should have left boxing a winner, denied a verdict over young Joe Bugner by Harry Gibbs. While not a man to harbour malice, Cooper never quite forgave Gibbs. The mark of the man, in a way, was how he was embraced once he stopped fighting. Business rushed towards him. He was a Lloyd's name and famously lost a small fortune through that investment, but was a steady earner on the after-dinner circuit. Brut took him on and made him famous again. He linked with Frank Bruno, another heavyweight of fleeting achievement who was universally loved. But he walked away from commentary when disgusted by the hype. Cooper did not need accolades to sustain his self-worth. One moment he held dear. On April Fool's day 16 years ago, a story was put about that Cooper was making a comeback at the age of 60. The wonder of it, he said later, was that nearly everyone believed it. He will be remembered for small asides, such as observing that cauliflower ears were usually the sign of a good boxer because it showed he could slip punches with just a small shift of his head, the ears being laced by the whir of his opponent's glove. He regretted, too, that he used to run in heavy work boots because it put such strain on his knees. Nostalgia and adoration aside, he was a fighting man to his core. He was a transparently sensitive man, too. Henry had a pacemaker fitted for the past few years, and the passing of his wife, Albina, two years ago bore more heavily than any other worry on that big heart of his."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
