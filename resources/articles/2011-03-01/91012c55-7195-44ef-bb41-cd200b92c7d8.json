While this side do, at worst, have to come fourth to take themselves towards next season's Champions League that was not the true issue that inflamed them as they came from 1-0 down to beat Manchester United. This was as resounding a clash as ever between these clubs. The night rang with grievances from the losers. Their centre-half Nemanja Vidic was sent off with a second booking in stoppage time following a foul on Ramires and he will therefore miss Sunday's match with Liverpool at Anfield. The United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, complained that there ought to have been a pair of cautions, too, for David Luiz. He not only escaped a second yellow card for a foul on Wayne Rooney but also scored his first goal for the club to equalise. Chelsea even won the game in debatable fashion. Frank Lampard slipped the ball to the substitute Yuri Zhirkov and he appeared to run into Chris Smalling, with very slight movement from the centre-half. The referee Martin Atkinson deemed it a foul and Lampard crashed the spot-kick into the middle of the goal after 80 minutes. While Chelsea have a seasoned line-up that has appeared jaded at times in this campaign, they did respond to this challenge. The side eased above Tottenham Hotspur into fourth place, but there was another sort of standing in mind. This was the kind of event by which footballers measure themselves and, in their minds, Chelsea regained their proper status. With a quarter-final place all but confirmed in the Champions League, the side will feel that purpose has flooded back into this campaign. The glow is all the brighter for the satisfaction in overturning the initial presumptions about the outcome when United were sharper and far more animated. Chelsea then looked set on encouraging the notion that they are a burnt-out team. Instead, they went on to singe the prospects of Ferguson's men, who continue to lack Rio Ferdinand and will now see Vidic serve a ban in a critical fixture at Anfield. Fernando Torres is still without a goal since the \u00a350m move from Liverpool, but that was nothing more than an academic issue for Chelsea on an evening of this intensity. United's last victory on this pitch continues to be the one they recorded in 2002. That statistic did not seem likely when an eager side made the opposition seem pedestrian at best in the first-half. United had an urgency that promised the kind of impact that brought the opener from Rooney after half an hour. Chelsea may then have been the most disgruntled of all that the forward had not been sent off and so banned for his elbowing of Wigan's James McCarthy at the weekend, but the hosts' own failings before the interval were the true issue. Chelsea's selection looked bold, with Torres paired in attack with Nicolas Anelka, but that was an irrelevance while all the energy and appetite were United's. They took the lead and, consistent with Chelsea's sluggishness at that stage, Branislav Ivanovic was dilatory as he allowed Rooney to turn and hit a low 25-yarder whose accuracy was too much for the goalkeeper Petr Cech. The merits of Torres and Anelka as a combination could not be debated when the midfield so rarely ferried the ball to them. Chelsea continued to sideline the forwards but in the 54th minute they pulled level. The central defenders were still around United's penalty area following a corner and when Michael Essien flighted the ball into the middle a knock-down from Ivanovic was rifled past Edwin van der Sar at his near post by David Luiz. His club would love to suppose that such an exploit does promise a revitalisation to come at Stamford Bridge. But the Brazilian next caught the eye with a foul on Rooney that brought him his booking. United had not been parted from their desire to carry the game to Chelsea. The introduction of Didier Drogba for Anelka indicated Ancelotti's intent to maintain freshness in the forward line. If the match itself was not particularly distinguished it held the attention because of the glaring desire of visitors as much as hosts to win this game. Poise did go missing and when Rooney went past Essien he then put an aimless ball through an unmanned area of the goalmouth. The attitude of each club was uncompromising. Just as Ancelotti had sent on Drogba, Sir Alex Ferguson introduced Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs on to the field, with the Welshman equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's record for United of 606 League appearances. It may be a while before Giggs feels there is anything at all to be cherished about this evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
