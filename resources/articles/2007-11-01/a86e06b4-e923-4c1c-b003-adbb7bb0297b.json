Her surprising commitment was made in the Commons during a debate on the frequency with which the union flag flies above public buildings. The discussions on a new flag design bring a new dimension to Gordon Brown's debate about Britishness. Hodge told MPs: \"The Welsh dragon was not included on the union flag, as the principality of Wales was already united with England by 1606 when the first union flag was created. I can assure all MPs that the issue of the design of the union flag will be considered. As the current flag is formed by merging three heraldic crosses representing the three kingdoms of the UK, the original design was a challenge. \"Thinking of a new design that would meet everyone's aspiration would be an even greater challenge.\" Hodge made the concession after complaints from Welsh MPs about constituents not feeling well represented. Albert Owen, Labour MP for Ynys Mon, said in the debate: \"We are all patriots - we are Welsh patriots and British patriots - but we in Wales do not feel part of the union flag because the dragon or the cross of St David is not on it.\" The issue was initially raised by Ian Lucas, another Labour MP, who complained that the flag introduced in 1606 following the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne as James I combined the cross of St George and the saltire of St Andrew. This principle continued in 1801 when the St Patrick cross was incorporated following the Union with Ireland Act 1800. Lucas claimed the identity of Wales had been suppressed ever since the Act of Union between England and Wales in 1536. \"The three crosses making up today's union flag are the crosses of the patron saints of the three countries represented on the flag,\" he said. \"We could add the cross of St David, but for me yellow and black would not be an ideal design. The recognised symbol of Wales is the Welsh dragon. I would like to see the incorporation of the Welsh dragon on to the union flag so that it would represent the four constituent nations of the UK.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
