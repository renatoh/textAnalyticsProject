Robertson, the country\u2019s captain, was applauded into dinner by teammates and staff after landing in Glasgow following Liverpool\u2019s victory over Tottenham. Next is the international double header against Cyprus and Belgium. \u201cMy full focus was on joining up with the Scotland squad and I wanted to get up as quickly as I could,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible week but it\u2019s all about trying to top it off now. The motivation is the same as all the lads at Liverpool \u2013 we want to play as many games [as possible] and playing for your country is still the biggest honour. It\u2019s irrelevant what we\u2019ve won and what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s still a huge honour for me to lead the team out and walk out and play these important games. \u201cMy full focus was always coming up here. Whether I was struggling or not I was always going to come up here and at least get assessed and luckily I\u2019m fit and healthy and there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t play these games.\u201d If anything Robertson\u2019s latest achievement at Liverpool appears to have intensified his desire to sample success with his country. Scotland\u2019s men\u2019s wait to reach a major tournament stretches back to 1998. \u201cI want more of those feelings that I had on Saturday,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cI want that success at club level, more of it with Liverpool. It is not just we have won the big cup and let\u2019s all pack it in now. I want to win more trophies. I want to win more trophies for Liverpool and bring success to Scotland. To do that we need to go again, we\u2019ve got a new start now and we need to qualify for the Euros because that would be as special, I feel. \u201cIt does make me more determined. Having those happy feelings, those success feelings, I want to have that a lot more and I am sure all the lads want to experience it.\u201d The visit of Cyprus to Hampden Park on Saturday marks Steve Clarke\u2019s first game as Scotland\u2019s manager. Robertson was elevated to captain under Clarke\u2019s immediate predecessor, Alex McLeish, but on Friday the full-back admitted he was well aware of negativity attached to that regime. \u201cI\u2019ve only been here a couple of days but it does feel different,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt feels more positive. That comes from the manager and the staff and they have been different class since they came in. \u201cBut it\u2019s now time for us to try and show it. That\u2019s what the manager wants too. It\u2019s all very well doing it behind the scenes but Saturday and Tuesday are about trying to show it on the pitch. We know how tough those two games are going to be. Although it has only been a short space of time, we feel we have made progress over this week. It will only get better.\u201d An early indicator of Clarke\u2019s influence is shown by the fact not a single player has withdrawn. \u201cThe pleasing thing for me was, when I got the players together, I didn\u2019t feel any negativity,\u201d said the former Kilmarnock manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
