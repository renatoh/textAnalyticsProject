As a child she spent her days singing along to her favourite ditties and accidentally became an accomplished jazz singer. While spending some time with friends in England she decided on a whim to apply for a course at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and met the man who would go on to become her husband and musical partner. From there she found herself appearing in Ian McKellen's film of Richard III, and then soared into the musical stratosphere with a series of internationally best-selling albums. It would all be enough to make you sick if she wasn't so charming. Kent's repertoire consists of hoary old chestnuts from Great American Songwriters such as Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. She delivered them with such finesse that it would only have taken a bit of crackle and pop to make you think you were listening to Billie Holliday or Ella Fitzgerald. Every aspect of her singing revealed remarkable control and attention to detail; the sensuous sibilants, whispered vibratos and polished phrasing coming together to evoke a bygone age when songs always had a proper tune and were always nicely sung. This kind of finely wrought nostalgia requires a band of considerable skill, and Kent's lived up to the task. Colin Oxley's guitar sound was so pure and clean it could almost have possessed healing qualities, while Dave Newton's piano and Simon Thorpe's double bass played into each other's pockets with good-natured friskiness. However, it was Kent's husband Jim Tomlinson who provided the most soulful accompaniment to the vocal line, his saxophone producing raindrop cascades of almost bottomless sadness. Tomlinson's seductive emotionalism actually highlighted his wife's only shortcoming: she makes her art sound too easy. Seemingly out to win hearts rather than break them, she never quite manages to live through a song or inhabit it with the smouldering passion of a Billie Holliday. But then, singing the blues is always going to be a tad problematic when you've got a perfect life. Stacey Kent plays the Plough Arts Centre, Torrington (01805 622552), tonight, then tours to Edenbridge and Maidstone. Wigan Jazz Festival"}, "isHosted": false}}}
