Yet there are 11,000 registered winter bathers in Denmark \u2013 probably double that if you consider all the people who do it privately. I live close to Vedbaek beach, north of Copenhagen, where there is a jetty that the Viking club swimmers go out from each morning, whatever the weather. Last year, the sea froze for the first time in 20 years. I noticed the bathers, so I returned to photograph them each day for about a week. There were lots of pensioners \u2013 one woman had just turned 100 \u2013 and they all had schnapps before or after a swim. I prefer telling stories about real people rather than setting something up and capturing the illusory. This project was based on my interest in why the bathers do this crazy thing: it's dangerous and painful, yet they swear by it. Scientifically, a dip in the icy water is a shock treatment. The body is cooled rapidly, and its defense has to work overtime. Blood vessels shrink, triggering a cocktail of endorphins, adrenaline and dopamine. It's like the body's own chemist, keeping away disease, supporting the immune system and prolonging life. The boy in this picture, Anton, is 14 and the son of a friend, both of whom are occasional winter bathers. I told them about this great location where I could set up lights on the bridge, and put a Styrofoam reflector on the ice so I could crawl around and take pictures without falling through. Just as Anton was going in, I noticed a flock of birds coming across the sky, then as he went under the water and up again it all came together. I was using a Hasselblad digital, and you can only shoot a frame every one-and-a-half seconds, so I just got one picture. But I love the clouds, birds, colour \u2013 the whole thing. And Anton's expression gives us the chance to see his reaction in a moment of courage. \u2022 David Trood's work is on show at It Takes More at the Getty Images Gallery, London W1, until 19 November.
