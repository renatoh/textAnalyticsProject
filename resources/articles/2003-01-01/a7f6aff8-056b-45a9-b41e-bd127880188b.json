However he added that Iraq's 12,000 page weapons declaration was incomplete - a charge immediately disputed by the chief science adviser to Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. Mr Blix and his counterpart Mohammed el-Baradei, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency, today delivered interim assessments to the UN Security Council in New York on Iraq's weapons declaration. The move comes ahead of the delivery of a formal report on the inspections by Mr Blix on January 27. Today Mr Blix told reporters at the United Nations headquarters in New York: \"We have now been there for some two months and been covering the country in ever wider sweeps and we haven't found any smoking guns.\" But he added: \"We think that the declaration failed to answer a great many questions\". He called on Iraq to answer outstanding questions in the declaration on chemical, biological and missile programs, which is required under Resolution 1441. \"Iraq may have more to say. I hope so,\" he said. However Iraq's official press agency challenged the United States and Britain to prove allegations that Baghdad is hiding weapons of mass destruction. Saddam's presidential adviser Amir al-Saadi told a visiting South African delegation he could cite specific information in the report, submitted to the United Nations last month, to refute claims that Iraq has not eliminated banned weapons. \"People who claim there were gaps, I could tell you right away they have not read it,\" he said. \"There were no gaps, and I could give you where to find the answers in the specific pages or tables and information.\" After his last briefing to the council on December 19, Mr Blix urged the United States and Britain to hand over any evidence they have about Iraq's secret weapons programs so UN inspectors can check it. He today said he was receiving the information: \"We are getting intelligence from several sources and I will not go into the operative part of that, but it is clear that this will be helpful in the future to us,\" he explained. \"We have gone to, I think about 125 sites already, and some of them were not visited before, and there will be more. And as more intelligence comes in, there will be more sites visited. I'm confident that we will get more intelligence,\" Blix told reporters. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, today told the Washington Post that the US has begun giving inspectors \"significant intelligence\" that has enabled them to become \"more aggressive and to be more comprehensive in the work they're doing.\" But Washington is holding back some information to see if inspectors \"are able to handle it and exploit it,\" Mr Powell said. \"It is not a matter of opening up every door we have.\" \u00b7 A UN inspector has raised the possibility of taking Iraqi scientists to Cyprus for questioning, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein said today. Amir al-Saadi said the idea was not raised as a formal request. Asked how Iraq responded, he said: \"The matter is up to the person themself ... [but] nobody is ready to go outside for an interview with [inspectors]\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
