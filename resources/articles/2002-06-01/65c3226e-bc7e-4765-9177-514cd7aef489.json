Ignore the hundreds of millions watching, the nation depending on the result and the strong probability that your performance will be remembered for the rest of your life. Just try to think of it as another 90 minutes of what you do best. That is what Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson intends to tell his players before they begin their World Cup campaign against Sweden in Saitama today. He has every confidence in them - 'I have faith in all 23' - and if England reward that confidence by staying as calm and relaxed as their coach, an adventure of epic proportions may be about to unfold. 'England is a big, big football country and for all the players it is a great honour to be here,' Eriksson said. 'Whether you play in every game or just come on for two minutes you can be proud to have taken part in the biggest tournament in the world.' Sometimes you can see why Eriksson attracts criticism for stating the obvious, yet there is undoubtedly something inspiring in the way he says it. It is not just the foreign accent and the halting English either. It took rather more than that to rescue England's ailing qualification campaign by producing that sensational result in Munich, and the detractors who would have you believe anyone could have beaten Germany 5-1 that day should check back and read what the British newspapers were saying in the weeks leading up to the game. Forget all the nondescript stuff in between. Saitama today and Sapporo on Friday are the next instalments of the story that began with a streaky win at Anfield and caught everyone's imagination through a convincing one in Germany. The time has arrived for the conclusion, and also, one hopes, for Eriksson's England. Either they can hit those heights again and have a successful World Cup, or fluff their lines and be intimidated by a difficult group. 'I think the key for us this time around is to make sure we play to our full potential,' said FA chief executive Adam Crozier, the man instrumental in hiring England's first foreign coach. 'We have shown that when we do, we are as good as anyone.' Arguably that was the way England went out of the last World Cup. There was no dishonour in losing to Argentina on penalties, and they certainly played to their full potential in St Etienne, though they might have gone farther in the competition had they managed to produce performances of that quality in the group games. Eriksson is only too aware there is even less margin for error this time. He is no longer talking about killing Sweden, perhaps because so many of his countrymen now attend his press conferences, but he is insistent that England will need to hit the ground running. 'We have to peak immediately,' he said. 'Sweden, Argentina, Nigeria: where is the easy team in there? I cannot find it. We cannot afford to start slowly and grow in the competition as some teams do, otherwise our World Cup could be finished very quickly.' England have not beaten Sweden for 34 years, but do have a couple of advantages. Their coach knows the opposition back to front. 'They are very compact, and when they lose the ball they are one of the quickest teams around at getting about eight men behind it,' Eriksson said. 'They have had the same side together for several years now, and just change one or two players when they need to, without altering the system. Their midfielders are interchangeable, although they cannot replace Freddie Ljungberg. That would be like us losing David Beckham. I guess Ljungberg will play though.' The other significant boost is that England have not lost Beckham. Not even Kieron Dyer in the end, though both feared the worst last week. Beckham admits he is only 95 per cent fit - it is difficult to make up the other five per cent without match practice - though that is enough for Eriksson. 'Ninety-five per cent of David Beckham is not bad at all,' he said. 'I would not like to risk more players returning from injury than that, but I think we can get away with one.' Although Eriksson wants as much pace in the team as possible - Darius Vassell is likely to partner Michael Owen in attack to try to get behind the Swedish back four - that means he is unlikely to start with Dyer on the left. The not-all-that-slow Emile Heskey should fill that position, with Dyer a possibility to come on from the bench in the second half. With Nicky Butt and Robbie Fowler needing more recovery time, England are likely to line up as follows: Seaman, Mills, Ferdinand, Campbell, A Cole, Beckham, Hargreaves, Scholes, Heskey, Vassell, Owen. Beckham has said there are no nerves in the squad, Eriksson agrees, and wants his captain to put his recent injury out of his mind. 'It is important he doesn't think about it, he must not worry on the field,' Eriksson said. 'None of us should. Our quality must come through, and I think it will.' Easy for him to say, though Eriksson is not in the habit of wasting words. Not when he has his players hanging on every one of them. There is a set routine Eriksson goes through on big- match days that begins with a team talk in the squad hotel. 'I talk for about 10 minutes, with lots of repetition. Simple messages about attack and defence, the strengths of the opposition,' he explained. 'Then at the stadium, when you have more than an hour to wait in the dressing room before kick off, it is a time for small jokes and smiles. 'I try to talk to each player then, in turn. Last-minute advice, but brief. No more than a minute or two with each one, sometimes only 30 seconds. As the kick-off approaches the players start to clench their fists and encourage each other, which is natural. I don't say anything then, but I try to have a quick last word as the team is going out.' And what does Eriksson say at that time? What will be his last message before England's World Cup commences? 'Don't be afraid. It is just a game of football.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
