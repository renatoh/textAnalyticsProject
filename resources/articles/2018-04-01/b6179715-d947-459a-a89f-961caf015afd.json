The 80th-minute goal led to a final against Arsenal as they won 4-2. Yet Matic is all too aware that disappointment may follow should Manchester United knock out Spurs in the last four on Saturday. The 29-year-old\u2019s CV shows a chequered experience in finals, including the 2-1 defeat by Arsenal last May. Before that he was an unused substitute when Chelsea won the Cup in May 2010, suspended when they claimed the 2015 League Cup and lost the 2013 Europa League final \u2013 against Chelsea \u2013 with Benfica. Matic, though, prefers to point to positives. \u201cI won the cup in Portugal and Slovakia [at Kosice]. I won the Portuguese League, the Premier League two times,\u201d he says before admitting the disappointments give extra motivation to claim the FA Cup. Recalling that shot that beat Hugo Lloris so memorably, Matic says: \u201cIt was amazing I scored that goal \u2013 I was really happy and I\u2019ll never forget. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say if this was my best but one of maybe the three best and most important goals in my life.\u201d This represents United\u2019s last hope of a trophy. \u201cThe FA Cup is very important for every team,\u201d Matic says. \u201cThe Premier League is most important in England, but the Cup is second.\u201d United finished sixth last season while claiming the Carabao Cup and Europa League. They are involved in a three-way tussle for second place, standing four points ahead of Liverpool and six better off than Spurs, with four matches remaining. Matic believes that finishing as runners-up and FA Cup winners is not enough for United. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is not but to finish second in the league is not bad,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always want more and try to be first.\u201d Drawing on the experience of being a double title-winner with Chelsea, Matic is adamant that United were not ready to be champions this season. The dismal 1-0 defeat against West Bromwich on Sunday handed Manchester City the crown and the Serb, asked whether he can see similarities between Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s United and the manager\u2019s victorious Chelsea of three years ago, says: \u201cNot yet. We need to have more experience in different kinds of situations during the game. \u201cWe drop many points when we shouldn\u2019t, and not doing so comes with experience. For example, at Leicester in the last second [drawing 2-2], then we lost at Huddersfield [2-1]. \u201cAgainst Chelsea, Man City, everything is possible. But in these [other] kind of games if you win almost every one you are champions.\u201d City are 13 points ahead and Matic is unsure whether they can be overhauled next year. \u201cI hope so, we improve step by step,\u201d the midfielder says. \u201cWhen you win the league there is more pressure \u2013 everyone expects you to do the same but it is not easy to repeat. Opponents are more ready, they give everything, they want to beat the champions. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it at Chelsea. It is hard but you need to be ready. We won in 2015 and 2017 with Chelsea and all the players knew that [the following season] everyone was going to give everything against them.\u201d The defeat by West Brom, the bottom club in the Premier League, was the latest illustration of how erratic United can be. This has caused a frustrated Mourinho to criticise his players throughout the campaign. Only Matic \u2013 and Romelu Lukaku \u2013 have been praised by the manager for being consistently brilliant. \u201cWhen I came here I wanted to show my qualities, I wanted to bring something and I am happy that the manager, my team-mates and the club are happy with my job. That is why I am here and will try to do the same for the rest of my time.\u201d Matic denies it has caused any dressing-room teasing. \u201cNo one has said anything. What I have to say is I am proud. We have a good relationship as a coach and a player but no more than that. Jos\u00e9 is always Jos\u00e9.\u201d Matic\u2019s move last summer caused puzzlement given how integral he was to Chelsea\u2019s championship triumph and how it would strengthen United. Yet he clams up on this. \u201cMany people ask me about that but I don\u2019t want to say,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly me, my family and agent know the truth.\u201d Whereas Matic has prospered under Mourinho, Paul Pogba has endured a difficult time, being dropped and substituted regularly in recent matches. As a midfield partnership their characters are yin and yang. Pogba\u2019s penchant for social media, coloured hair and dancing goal celebrations has a diametric opposite in Matic\u2019s uber-quiet off-field persona. There is a dry sense of humour, though, as evidenced by his take when asked whether he might countenance blue or red hair. \u201cNo, I have kids \u2013 if I do that my son is going to do the same; I have to have serious hair like Gary Neville,\u201d Matic says, before also brushing off adopting a dance routine when he scores. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just simple.\u201d United lost 2-0 at Tottenham in January\u2019s league fixture, a game when Mourinho removed Pogba on 63 minutes. Matic, though, offers no insight as to why. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the game,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 we play many games.\u201d Clearer is the drive that allowed Matic\u2019s rise from lowly beginnings 13 years ago to the brilliant career he now enjoys. \u201cIn Serbia I played in the third division [at Kolubara], which is like League One in England \u2013 probably worse. I earned \u00a370 per month at 17-18,\u201d he says and explains why he moved to Slovakia. \u201cI had the opportunity to go there and I said: \u2018Let\u2019s try it.\u2019 \u201cThere is an interesting story because an agent wanted to take me to a Serbian club and I was not happy to do so. He asked: \u2018Where do you want to go then?\u2019 I was sitting at a table with him, playing third division, and I told him: \u2018I wanted to go to Manchester United.\u2019 He was like: \u2018What is he talking about?\u2019 I was joking but it shows everything is possible.\u201d So what, then, of the semi-final against Spurs. \u201cWe need to see where we made mistakes [in the loss],\u201d Matic says. \u201cWe need to approach the game in a different way for sure and this [previous] game helps.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
