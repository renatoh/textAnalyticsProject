I look after some of their stations, which includes looking after the staff, the buildings -their upkeep and management - and the whole ticket selling process. It's a challenge, but good fun. \"I found it difficult to pin down what I wanted to do. I had thought of public relations or journalism, and even horticulture. I wanted to do something positive. \"The railways, despite their private operation, are still a very socially-orientated business. So I made up my mind to go for it. I think it was a good choice. When you manage stations you can see the results eventually. \"Because transport is a 24 hours-a-day business I also thought it would be varied. And dealing with so many people, staff and issues, I reckoned it would be challenging. It's been hard work but a great learning curve. \"I had some concern that the staff, because of the nature of the industry, might be reluctant to trust graduates, that there might be some resistance because I hadn't worked my way up. The job gives me authority but it seems to be my behaviour that generates the respect. \"I'm a bit impatient and get frustrated when things take longer to do than I would like. But the company I work for moves so many passengers every day that it's exciting. I'm lucky that my manager lets me get on with it but is always there with advice and experience. \"This industry has so much history. Experience counts for so much - it's almost a way of life. \"The rail industry is huge with thousands of people working in it, many of whom the public don't see, such as the timetable planners. They're all passionate about their work and most strive to run a better service.\" Interview by Eileen Sheridan (sheri@dircon.co.uk)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
