The 16-year-old was abducted and suffered a series of assaults before being stabbed to death in a secluded park in Reading on May 7, Reading crown court heard. Her 18-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was also repeatedly raped and assaulted and was shot in the centre of her forehead but \"miraculously\" survived, the court heard. Opening the prosecution's case, Richard Latham QC, said that next week the 18-year-old, who was forced to watch her friend being fatally stabbed, would give evidence and describe the \"simply horrific\" attacks. Mr Latham said that the 18-year-old was told her own last memory would be watching Mary-Ann being butchered in the park. The psychological torture was meant to last until the time of death, Mr Latham said. When Mary-Ann was lying on the ground in the park one of the men started stabbing her \"everywhere\" on her body; she pleaded to be stabbed in the neck, but \"they said they wanted her to die slowly\", Mr Latham said. Both the victims were forced to smoke heroin and crack cocaine by their attackers while they were raped and attacked with knives for several hours in a cramped guesthouse room, the jury heard. Towels were put down on the floor, Mr Latham said to stop blood being found later for evidence. The barrister said that the gang had targeted the girls \"for revenge\" after one of the defendants, who knew them, became convinced they had set him up for a robbery. The court heard that Adrian Thomas, 20, a painter who had started renting a flat in Reading, had been assaulted and burgled on April 18 or 19, a couple of months prior to the attacks on the girls. Mr Latham said Mr Thomas believed the girls had left the door to the flat open deliberately and a quantity of drugs was allegedly stolen by other individuals, \"bad company\", who the girls knew previously. Mr Latham said that a couple of weeks after the robbery Mr Thomas had gathered a gang together in south London to \"sort the girls out\". The court heard they had a \"gameplan\" and set off with various weapons. The defendants are Mr Thomas, of Battersea, south London; Llewellyn Adams, 24, of Balham, south London; Indrit Krasniqi, 18, of Chiswick, west London; Michael Johnson, 19, of Southfields, south-west London and brothers Jamaile and Joshua Morally, 23 and 22, of Balham, south London. They all deny a total of nine counts each, which include one charge of murder, one charge of attempted murder, two counts of kidnap, three counts of rape and two of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Jamaile Morally also denies a further charge of raping Mary-Ann. Mr Latham said the teenagers' ordeal on May 6 last year started when Mary-Ann and her friend were sitting in a car in the car park of the Wallingford Arms pub in Reading. The barrister told the court that the two girls were bundled into the boot of a red Nissan Almera by the gang and driven to the Abbey guesthouse in Reading, where the men booked into room 19. The girls were force to strip naked, raped vaginally and orally, cut with knives, hit with a metal pole and told repeatedly that they would be murdered, the QC said. At one point a gun was put into the 18-year-old girl's mouth while the men laughed, the jury was told. Mr Latham said that, despite her ordeal, the 18-year-old girl was able to recall specific roles played by the individuals in the torture, with Mr Thomas, the Morally brothers and Mr Johnson apparently taking the leading roles. The QC said: \"At times, some of the men would ask Thomas for permission to do things, asking if they could burn or stab the girls. He gave that permission, saying 'Yes, go on, I don't care. It's too late now. Nobody is going to help them now.'\" After hours of abuse, the girls were then taken to Prospect Park with pillows over their heads, the jury heard. At the park, Mr Latham said: \"It was Johnson who then stabbed Mary-Ann in the abdomen with a large brown kitchen knife. He had her by the neck and hair; she was begging him to stab her in the neck. \"Mary-Ann then fell on her side and Johnson was stabbing her everywhere. She fell over in a ball trying to protect herself but he rolled her over trying to find a new place on her body to stab her. They said they wanted her to die slowly. She became unable to move and just lay there crying, when she cried or made any sound she was stabbed again.\" The friend heard the men discussing whether to shoot Mary-Ann but learnt then that the bullet was intended for her, the court heard. Mr Latham said the men asked Mary-Ann's friend: \"Are you ready to die?\" \"A loaded gun was placed against her forehead and it was discharged. She was instantly unconscious and she was left for dead,\" Mr Latham said. \"Miraculously the bullet did not kill her; it was she who raised the alarm asking for the assistance of a passerby.\" The court heard how the 18-year-old awoke, found Mary-Ann lying next to her, still breathing, and walked in a daze to a road, where she was nearly hit by cars. She raised the alarm with a man passing by. When police arrived at the park, Mary-Ann had died. Mr Latham told the jury of eight women and four men that the men in the dock today had been jointly charged and shared joint responsibility for what happened to Mary-Ann and her friend. The QC said a police search of the park revealed a Mickey Mouse sock lying close to Mary-Ann's body. Mr Latham said DNA evidence of Mary-Ann's blood and evidence pointing to Mr Thomas as well as gunshot particles were found on the sock. The QC said the men had \"joint responsibility\" for the alleged attacks. However, the court was told that Mr Adams, the driver of the car, sat through most of what was taking place without actively participating, although he laughed along with the other men. Mr Krasniqi, the court was told, also played a smaller part, although a witness recalled seeing him standing over the girls with a knife at one point, laughing and pointing at Mary-Ann saying: \"Cut her fat off.\" The trial continues on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
