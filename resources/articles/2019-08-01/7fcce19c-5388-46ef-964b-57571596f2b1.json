Pogba won the penalty in the 67th minute when he was tripped by Conor Coady and he insisted on taking it himself even though Marcus Rashford volunteered. Rui Patricio saved his shot, meaning Pogba has missed four penalties in the last year. Rashford has never missed. Gary Neville, commentating for Sky Sports, suggested that the fact that Pogba felt entitled to take the penalty suggested there was a lack of leadership in the United team. Solskj\u00e6r dismissed that idea, explaining that he is happy for Pogba and Rashford to decide between themselves who will step up to the spot at any given moment. \u201cThey are the two designated penalty takers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two of them are confident and good penalty takers. When there are two names there, it\u2019s the one who is the most confident [who takes it]. Paul has scored many before so there\u2019s absolutely no problem. \u201cSometimes in a game you grow in confidence, sometimes [you think] \u2018I don\u2019t want to take it today because I had a bad game\u2019. I\u2019ve absolutely no problem with players walking up and saying \u2018This is mine\u2019.\u201d Solksj\u00e6r also said he had no quibble with Daniel James, the 21-year-old winger who was booked for simulation on his first start for United. The Norwegian said he had not seen replays of the incident in the first half when James knocked the ball past Joao Moutinho before going to ground but he suggested the player may have been taking evasive action. \u201cHe\u2019s that quick and he gets kicked so many times that it is natural for him to try to protect himself with a jump sometimes,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cHow many fouls did he suffer today? How many times did they go through him? I\u2019ve got absolutely no problem with him if he tries to avoid being kicked.\u201d Solskjaer said he was encouraged by many aspects of his team\u2019s performance, especially a first half in which they took the lead through a fine goal by Anthony Martial. He rued the way United let Wolves fight back in the second half, during which the hosts equalised thanks to a wonderful strike by R\u00faben Neves. \u201cThe first half was a mature performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dominated possession; we got the first goal, which was a great goal, then in the second half we knew they were going to come on like a house on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a bit sloppy and played into their hands and they got a goal that they probably deserved. But then we took control again and could have won it.\u201d Neves\u2019s goal was awarded after a two-minute consultation with VAR, apparently as officials tried to determine whether there had been an offside in the buildup. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo pleaded with authorities to find a way of reaching decisions more quickly. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid is we will be afraid to celebrate a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe energy and sound of Molineux, we cannot lose this atmosphere. They have to find a solution for it. Please do it.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r agreed but said he would rather \u201cthey get the decision right than get the wrong one but take only 15 seconds\u201d. Solskj\u00e6r also revealed that Alexis S\u00e1nchez could leave United before the European transfer window closes on 2 September. \u201cThere are still a couple of weeks left of the transfer window and some clubs have shown interest in Alexis, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
