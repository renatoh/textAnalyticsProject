Deep breath. I\u2019m going to talk about Heart\u2019s new national breakfast show. This started on Monday, with long-standing Heart London breakfast presenter Jamie Theakston being joined by Amanda Holden (full title: Amanda from Britain\u2019s Got Talent and the M&amp;S talk-at-you tills Holden). The show was pretty much as you might expect. Holden is a natural performer: funny, silly, confiding without actually telling you anything you didn\u2019t already know. I wish she wouldn\u2019t pretend to be stupid (\u201cThe periodic table? What\u2019s that?\u201d), but this might be early, please-like-me nerves. Holden is friendly and thoroughly professional. Ashley Roberts, ex-Pussycat Doll and Strictly almost-winner, is another new hiring, in to give us showbiz news (stuff about Love Island), and there\u2019s also the usual win-a-load-of\u2011cash phone-in competition to keep you listening. The deep breath is not because of any of this, but because Heart\u2019s brand new national breakfast show means I have to talk about the current state of the UK\u2019s commercial radio stations. Wait! Come back! Like many things in this world, the story is interesting and boring at the same time. Here goes with the boring bit. Last October, Ofcom, which is in charge of the UK\u2019s radio (including the BBC), made a change to the rules that govern commercial local radio\u2019s output. Previously, these so-called \u201clocalness guidelines\u201d insisted that any commercial local radio station had to feature at least seven hours of locally made output between 6am and 7pm, and this had to include the breakfast show. After October, such a station only had to feature three hours of local output, and the breakfast show did not have to be included. Ooooh, thought the three main commercial radio brands \u2013 Global, Bauer and Wireless Group, since you ask \u2013 these new rules mean that we can give the same breakfast show to lots of our local radio stations, making it, effectively, a national radio show. Global has already done this on Capital, with Roman Kemp, Vick Hope and Sonny Jay (who presented Capital\u2019s London breakfast show) going national on 8 April. Smooth Breakfast will go national before the end of the year, and there have been rumours that the presenting job was offered to Davina McCall (supposedly she wanted all school holidays off, so that was a no-no). Wireless, which doesn\u2019t own as many commercial local stations in the UK (it has a few in Ireland), has already made its big breakfast show move, by hiring Chris Evans to do Virgin\u2019s breakfast: a success. Bauer, which owns Hits, Kiss and Magic, is slightly behind, mostly because it\u2019s been busy buying up loads of other radio stations. Also, the most likely Bauer breakfast show to go national, Hits Manchester (which replaced Key 103), has not been a massive success, with the new breakfast show team of Gethin Jones, Dave Vitty and Gemma Atkinson being shunted aside after just one year\u2019s broadcasting (though Atkinson will get a drivetime show, with Wes Butters, after her maternity leave). Is any of this important? Well, if you liked the old local breakfast presenters, then, yes, it is. Jamie and Amanda are replacing 21 different breakfast shows, and the trade website Radio Today estimates that around 70 presenters and producers are being moved from that slot. All the other Heart shows are national now, too, except for the drivetime slot (remember that three hours\u2019 local output rule); there are 12 different regional Heart drivetime shows, and some of the old breakfast show presenters are moving there. Many more, of course, will be kicking their heels, and several of Global\u2019s regional buildings are being shuttered. The bigger question is, of course, do listeners want this? Does it matter if a breakfast show comes from London if the news and the traffic and travel is local? Or if, indeed, the whole day\u2019s output comes from the capital, apart from a three-hour drivetime show? I might be part of the London meeja elite, but to lose all this local talent does seem sad, even if Amanda Holden can generate national headlines simply by changing her frock. Three shows about\u2026 money Futureproof A new show hosted by 1Xtra\u2019s Jamz Supernova, this podcast aimed at 20- to 30-year-olds comes from Bud, a company that uses data to help banks, customers and financial providers. Futureproof was inspired by a six-month investigation into young UK adults and their money desires and disasters. Each week, Jamz talks to an interviewee about subjects such as saving to buy a property, how to beat paycheck panic, and whether social media is ruining your career prospects. Planet Money Planet Money has been going a long time \u2013 there are more than 900 episodes to choose from! \u2013 and knows what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s always entertaining, whether relating the story of how Japanese people started to eat raw salmon, or how the US unemployment rate got so low, or exactly what Trump\u2019s relationship is with debt. Contributors are lively, with great communication skills (no time is wasted). For the UK listener, it can be a bit American, but you can\u2019t fail to find a story that grabs you. FT Money Show This Financial Times weekly podcast has been running for over six years, so, again, there\u2019s a big back-catalogue. It\u2019s a simple format: host talks to various experts, about ISAs, pensions, credit scores etc. It\u2019s news-based \u2013 this week\u2019s episode discusses fund manager Neil Woodford and YouTube millionaires \u2013 so you can feel on top of what\u2019s going on. Be warned: this podcast\u2019s USP is clarity and calm (again, no surprise), so if you\u2019re looking for fireworks, better try a different show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
