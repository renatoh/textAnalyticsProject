No footie, no sausage sizzle and another Saturday without the sound of the auctioneer\u2019s cry and a hammer going down on a house sale. But what will the end of face-to-face auctions, and the coronavirus-compelled shift to online sales, do for the housing market? According to the experts, auctions will be in far fewer number. Corelogic expects 645 auctions in Melbourne, down 59% from last week, and 1,021 in Sydney, down 20%. Figures from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria are even worse \u2013 it expects just 280 auctions in Melbourne on the weekend, down from 795 at the same time last year. Experts are unsure if the sudden plunge in volume, together with the uncertainty people have over their incomes due to the wave of layoffs sweeping the country, will cause property prices to tumble, and if so by how much, although no one is seriously expecting them to soar. Adam Docking, who sells properties in Melbourne\u2019s leafy south-eastern suburbs and is the vice-president of the REIV, thinks the move online will test the skills of auctioneers like him. \u201cWith a street auction, the auctioneer feeds off the energy of the street,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an auctioneer, I\u2019m reading body language, I\u2019m reading the nuances of the crowd to know how to run the auction. \u201cI\u2019m also understanding that when there\u2019s a pause in the auction I can see why \u2013 is it because the buyers are talking among themselves, or they\u2019re seeking instructions, or something like that. \u201cWhereas with an online auction I\u2019m literally staring at an iPhone and I\u2019ve got no feedback.\u201d Ratings agency Moody\u2019s expects a significant increase in mortgage defaults as a result of the devastation shutting down industries including hospitality, retail and entertainment has wrought on the pay packets of workers. In a report released on Tuesday, it said the government\u2019s wages subsidy and a home loan deferral offered by the banks would reduce this surge for the next six months. \u201cHowever, we expect defaults and losses to rise beyond this period,\u201d it said. Analysts at investment bank UBS, meanwhile, have modelled house price falls of anywhere between 5% and 20%, depending on how severe the pandemic becomes. The bank\u2019s chief economist, George Tharenou, said the number of properties will \u201ccollapse \u2013 likely more than halving near-term \u2013 as long as the ban on auctions and open home inspections remains\u201d. \u201cWe also revise our forecast for home prices to start falling, given the hit to demand from the looming sharp recession and spike in unemployment,\u201d he said in a note to clients on Wednesday. Meanwhile, on online property investment forums, greed battles with fear amid guesses that falls will be in the order of about 20%. Real estate agents are generally unwilling to say that the market is set to tumble and this crisis is no different. Adrian Kelly, the president of national body the Real Estate Institute of Australia, agrees volumes will fall. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that will have a dramatic impact on values,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause what I\u2019m seeing is there are a number of potential sellers who are and will choose to wait this out.\u201d Docking says he can\u2019t tell what will happen to house prices. \u201cIf you\u2019d rung me an hour ago, I would have said absolutely they\u2019re going to drop,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019d rung me 50 minutes ago, I would probably think maybe not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
