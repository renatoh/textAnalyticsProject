The fire, which broke out at around 9.45am, destroyed the two-storey pavilion at the far end of the Grade I listed building, which has been abandoned since the 70s. A police spokesman later said: \"We are appealing for information, and have access to CCTV footage of the area which could be examined.\" The blaze was the third major blow to affect the historic structure, which was built in 1866, in the last three months. In December and January, major structural collapses sent parts of the concert hall, in the centre of the pier, crashing into the sea. Firefighters, who cordoned off the beach around the pier as hundreds of onlookers gathered, have now left the scene. They say they are treating the fire, which has left only the metal skeleton of the pavilion building remaining, as arson. Station commander Phil Thompson, of Brighton's Preston Circus Fire Station, said: \"The fire is definitely of doubtful origin. There is no way that it could have started on its own.\" Coastguard officials have ruled out the possibility of a speedboat seen near the West Pier shortly before smoke began billowing from the far end being connected with the fire. It comes only weeks after Brighton and Hove council voted to approve a \u00a330m restoration plan, backed by Lottery cash, for the pier. The plan had been opposed by the Noble Organisation, owners of the neighbouring Brighton Pier, and several residents' groups. Residents argued that new buildings proposed for the shoreward end of the pier would be too large. Despite the inferno, the West Pier's owner, the Brighton West Pier Trust, has vowed to press on with renovation plans, which it had hoped would be completed by 2005. The trust's chief executive, Geoff Lockwood, said: \"It will categorically not affect the authentic restoration. \"We have got sufficient original materials, designs and drawings and artefacts to restore it, no matter what happens to the pier. It is another sad day in the life of the West Pier, but it will be reborn.\" Mr Lockwood added: \"We are puzzled by it [the fire]. There is nothing combustible there, there is no electricity, and there is no access from the land, so how it started is a puzzle. There must be suspicion that it is deliberate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
