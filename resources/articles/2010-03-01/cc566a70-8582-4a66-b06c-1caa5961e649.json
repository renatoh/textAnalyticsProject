The biggest single award has been given to John Hourican, the new boss of the investment arm of the loss-making bank, as a reward for improving performance at his division. He has been granted 15.5 million shares, which are currently worth \u00a35.9m. That comes on top of another big award of shares last year, when Hourican was handed 21.3m shares and the right to buy a further 7.4m. The new shares have been awarded at 37.9p and are part of a \u00a31.7bn bonus pool the bank has set aside. Last night, the Liberal Democrat's Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, said: \"This is grotesquely generous.\" The size of the bonus pot was revealed last month when RBS disclosed a \u00a33.6bn loss for 2009 \u2013 an improvement on the record-breaking \u00a324bn loss it made in 2008, the year it was bailed out by the the taxpayer. The UK government now owns 84% of the shares in theEdinburgh-based bank and has the ability to veto the size of the bonus pool. The disclosure of the payout was made by RBS last night in a statement to the stock exchange after markets had closed. The head of the corporate bank, Chris Sullivan, was handed more than 1m shares, even though the bank failed to meet lending targets. Paul Geddes, the head of the insurance business which is up for sale and suffered a dramatic drop in profit in 2009, was handed 792,000 free shares, while RBS veteran Alan Dickinson received 968,072 shares. The most senior woman at RBS, Ellen Alemany, who runs the bank's US interests, has been given 3.64m shares while Nathan Bostock, a new recruit who is attempting to sell the most troubled operations of RBS, has received 1.2m shares. Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive has staunchly defended the need for the bailed-out banks to pay bonuses, arguing that if he cannot keep the best people he will never be able to return \u00a354bn of taxpayers money tied up in the bank. He insists that RBS could have made another \u00a31bn if it had not lost \"thousands\" of the banks' best staff in the past year . Since the banking crisis, the headcount at the investment bank has dropped from more than 24,000 to just over 16,000 \u2013 partly as a result of an exodus of workers lured to rivals able to pay cash bonuses. Under the terms set out by the government, anyone at RBS who earns more than \u00a339,000 is unable to take a cash payment in bonuses. Instead, all payments are made in shares and subject to clawback and, the bank argues, tie the employee to the bank for many years. Hourican, for instance, is unable to sell the shares he has been awarded for five years. Others have to wait three years. RBS shares are currently changing hands at 40p and the taxpayer will not break even on its investment until they reach 50.5p. At that level, yesterday's share handouts will be worth \u00a313m and Hourican's total share handouts to date will be worth more than \u00a322m. In a statement last night, RBS said: \"The board believes that the prospects of recovery are heavily dependent on having remuneration policies which are fundamentally reformed in structure but ensure that high performing staff are not disadvantaged by working at RBS relative to other competitor banks. \"All of the people concerned are new to role and have been charged with delivering the recovery plan for RBS. The awards are in shares and must be retained for a period of up to five years to ensure that staff and shareholder interests are aligned.\" Hester's share award details were not in yesterday's announcement because he has waived the possible \u00a32.4m of shares he could have received.The Barclays duo John Varley and Bob Diamond set the trend when they refused to accept their payouts. Eric Daniels, chief executive of the bailed out Lloyds Banking Group did not take the \u00a32.3bn he was due, while rivals at HSBC and Standard Chartered have taken their payments but pledged to hand them to charity. Such has been the insistence of banks to pay bonuses that the Treasury is set for a windfall of more than \u00a32.5bn from its one-off 50% levy on bonuses over \u00a325,000. The government put the tax on in December, just as bonus season was beginning.However, instead of changing the appetite among banks to pay bonuses, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, has received a much-needed boost to the Treasury's coffers as banks have instead swallowed the cost of the tax rather than reduce payments to staff. All the main UK banks have now reported and every one has been forced to defend payouts to its employees. Even so some banks remain defiant. HSBC, for instance, has handed its chief executive Michael Geoghegan \u2013 who gave his \u00a34m bonus to a range of charities including one with links to his wife \u2013 an estimated \u00a3800,000 pay rise just for relocating to Hong Kong. His previous salary was \u00a31m a year and HSBC has pledged to defy shareholders and hand him a formal pay rise by this time next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
