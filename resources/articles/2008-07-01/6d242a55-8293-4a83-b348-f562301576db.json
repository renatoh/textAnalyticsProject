They were a party band without much to say - rapper Rob Birch's melodic hooks were far more memorable than his leaden rhymes - and party bands always have a short time in the sun. Double Bubble, their third album since their momentum-destroying nine-year hiatus, gestures towards weightier issues, but Birch's vaporous politics and balsa-light depictions of Brixton street life dissolve into so much blather. Only the tough, electronic production of Nick Hallam and new teenage cohort Tic Tac holds the attention: witness Gringo's clobbering Middle Eastern dancehall. Those old enough to remember Connected as something more than a Carphone Warehouse jingle might feel a tremor of nostalgic affection, but little else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
