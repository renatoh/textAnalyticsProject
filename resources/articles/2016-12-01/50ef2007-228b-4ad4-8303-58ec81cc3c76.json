The former British prime minister told a gathering of politicians and businesspeople that, to combat the new surge in populism, centrists could not afford to shy away from widespread concerns over immigration and globalisation. \u201cWhat is new and what is very, very troubling to me is that if you look at the analysis that has just been done of support for democracy in democratic countries, some of these figures are to me quite shocking,\u201d Blair told a bipartisan conference in the US capital. A recent poll found that more than 30% of French people doubted whether democracy was the right system, he said. \u201cThis strongman type of authoritarian figure, this is one of the reasons why, for example, President Putin is admired in parts of European politics. It\u2019s interesting how many people reference that quite openly in a way that I think 10 years ago they really would not have spoken like that. \u201cI think there is a real risk that we forget what liberal democratic values are about and we don\u2019t understand that these values are absolutely fundamental to the human condition improving. But I think it all comes back to, well, what is going to be the alternative to the strongman? And the alternative to the strongman can\u2019t be a weak centre.\u201d Blair, who left office in 2007, suggested that Duterte \u2013 a fiery populist who has praised Adolf Hitler and made light of unlawful killings \u2013 has struck a chord in the Philippines \u201cbecause for years they weren\u2019t dealing with the problems of crime and drugs and the feeling that the system wasn\u2019t working for the ordinary person\u201d. And at a moment when \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d is under intense scrutiny in the US, Blair described social media as \u201ca revolutionary phenomenon\u201d that has changed everything about the way politics works. \u201cToday people know, or think they know, about the world. They break into self-conforming groups, they share the same opinion, they reinforce the same opinion, and they become very angry about the way of the world because they don\u2019t see politics as a difficult business where you\u2019re having to grind out results and take difficult decisions. They see it just in terms of an instantaneous like or dislike. \u201cThis is why the answer in my view is that the centre, if you want to push away and defeat this type of strongman politics, the centre\u2019s got to be strong and it\u2019s got to be vibrant and it\u2019s got to be dynamic. Otherwise you will find a situation where people say \u2013 this is most acute among young people, by the way \u2013 \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got no particular adherence to democracy, I just want the job done, so if this guy says he can do the job then let\u2019s get him elected.\u2019\u201d The centre should acknowledge issues of culture and identity, he added, because concerns over immigration are \u201cnot irrational\u201d in Europe. \u201cWe need a centre that is not a flabby, lowest-common-denominator wishy-washy between the left and the right. We need something strong and muscular that is providing answers to the challenges we face.\u201d Blair was speaking to both Democrats and Republicans at a conference organised by No Labels, which is launching a coalition of Super Pacs to raise $50m to support centrist members of Congress in elections. He did not include Donald Trump among his examples of strongmen. Asked if he had any advice for the US president-elect, Blair was diplomatic and avoided pessimism: \u201cThe issue is whether he\u2019s just going to focus on getting the most practical solutions and getting things done. If that\u2019s what happens, then the country will move forward ... Let\u2019s wait and see what happens.\u201d The former Labour leader insisted that the philosophy of the \u201cthird way\u201d that he pioneered with the Democratic president Bill Clinton in the 1990s was still relevant and should be separated from the policies of a given time. \u201cWe had a sense of forward momentum. We were the change makers, we weren\u2019t the guardians of the status quo.\u201d Blair, 63, who recently announced a new institute for centre-ground politics, insisted he had no desire to be back on the frontline. Pressed about whether he was sure, he said: \u201cSure enough. Sure enough to be sure at this moment, anyway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
