Philip Hammond will use his keynote Mansion House to the City\u2019s elite on Thursday to say that the government intends to strike deals outside of the single market that will make the UK a gateway to financial markets. The chancellor will also call on the EU to negotiate a wide-ranging post-Brexit financial services deal that would provide access to EU markets for UK firms and allow EU governments and companies to borrow money cheaply in London. The chancellor\u2019s insistence that London can be the gateway to global financial markets will be aimed at reassuring the City that London will continue to thrive after Brexit. \u201cConnectivity was always at the heart of London\u2019s success. And to succeed in the future, we must remain connected to the world \u2013 including the important emerging markets,\u201d Hammond will say. The chancellor\u2019s proposal involves bringing together governments, regulators and industry to build a system for opening up cross-border financial services, with the aim of improving access to global financial markets and reducing business costs. Britain has already started a series of financial dialogues with leading emerging market countries, such as China and Brazil, and these will form the basis of new partnerships. In the Mansion House speech, the chancellor will also emphasise that the government will stick to its plans for eliminating the budget deficit and reducing the UK\u2019s debt despite this week\u2019s pledge to spend more on the NHS. Making it clear that taxes will be raised in this autumn\u2019s budget, Hammond will say: \u201cWe are getting debt down, while investing in Britain\u2019s infrastructure, supporting our vital public services and helping hard working families, across the United Kingdom. \u201cThis week the prime minister announced a five-year NHS funding package that will boost spending on health by over \u00a320bn a year in real terms in England alone. So, as the prime minister said, across the nation taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
