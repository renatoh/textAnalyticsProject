We have to go to Porto and fight\u2019", "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp said Liverpool still have a fight on their hands to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League despite this comfortable win over Porto at Anfield. Liverpool controlled much of the quarter-final first leg with Naby Ke\u00efta and Roberto Firmino on the scoresheet in a dominant first-half display that threatened a repeat of last season\u2019s 5-0 win in the last-16 stage. It never materialised and Klopp claimed the tie is far from over before next Wednesday\u2019s return at Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. \u201cIn Porto we finished them off, tonight we didn\u2019t,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cThe game is still on, we have to go there and fight. Porto will try to strike back. It will be a tough game but that is what you expect in the quarter-finals of Champions League. There is still a lot to do, the atmosphere will be really tough and intense. This is the result we wanted before the game.\u201d The Porto striker Moussa Marega missed several good chances for a vital away goal but Klopp was content with the maturity his team displayed. He said: \u201cYou saw how physically strong the striker is, unbelievable. And I heard that he was a little bit ill before the game. If he\u2019s not ill, it will be a really tough one in Portugal. \u201cFinding the 100% mix of control and being a threat constantly is difficult but we were close to that. We probably didn\u2019t have as many chances as we wish in the second half but controlling happens in different ways. The best way is with the ball. When we lost it, we had to do a lot of work to get it back. 2-0 is a really, really good result. I would have bought it before the game and I will take it now. All good.\u201d Mohamed Salah escaped punishment for a bad challenge on the Porto captain, Danilo, late in the game despite the presence of VAR. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about referees or refereeing decisions,\u201d said S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, the Porto manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
