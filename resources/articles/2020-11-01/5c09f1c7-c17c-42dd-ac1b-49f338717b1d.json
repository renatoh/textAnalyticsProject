A worrying new assessment by the Australian National Audit Office has found planning for the next census is only \u201cpartly effective\u201d and the ABS has \u201cnot put in place arrangements to ensure that improvements to its architecture framework, change management processes and cybersecurity measures will be implemented ahead of the 2021 census\u201d. The ANAO says the bureau has established largely appropriate planning and governance arrangements for the next census, but the risk framework is \u201ccompromised by weaknesses in the assurance arrangements\u201d. The auditor says the ABS has been partly effective in addressing key risks, implementing past census recommendations and ensuring timely delivery of the 2021 survey but it says \u201cfurther management attention is required on the implementation and assessment of risk controls\u201d. The audit, released on Thursday, was conducted to check whether or not lessons had been learned from 2016. The last census was \u201cdigital first\u201d but the websites crashed during peak time on census night. The ABS had to close its online form for two days because of a failure of multiple information technology controls, particularly the online census form. As well as the IT disasters, there were also concerns about the privacy of personal information. The then Turnbull government and the ABS later explained the outage of the online census was the result of a systems failure and an \u201covercautious\u201d response to a denial of service attack. The then chief statistician, David Kalisch, later acknowledged the ABS had \u201cstuffed up some things in the conduct of the 2016 census\u201d and that \u201creflected not only on the ABS but on the reputation of government and the public sector more generally\u201d. The audit office said the failure of multiple IT controls during the 2016 census \u201creinforced the need for the ABS to implement robust planning arrangements for the 2021 census including for cybersecurity, procurement, and review recommendations\u201d. The ANAO said the technology framework for the 2021 census was \u201clargely appropriate, however, the ABS\u2019s implementation of its IT framework is not complete\u201d. The ABS had not established a process to \u201cmitigate the risk of unauthorised changes being implemented across systems supporting the census\u201d. The auditor said data handling practices were \u201cpartly appropriate\u201d. The ABS had designed controls and arrangements to manage risks relating to data quality and protection of privacy but it had \u201cnot fully implemented\u201d those controls and lacked \u201cappropriate arrangements to monitor control implementation\u201d. When it came to cybersecurity, the ABS had established \u201cpartly appropriate measures\u201d. The ANAO said the high-level measures and controls in the ABS\u2019 cybersecurity strategy were \u201csound \u2013 however, the strategy has not been fully implemented\u201d. The auditor general made seven recommendations to the ABS covering planning, efficiency, IT systems and data, risk controls and implementing external review recommendations. The ABS says it supports the ANAO\u2019s recommendations to improve systems \u201cand is in the process of implementing them in full before the August 2021 census\u201d. The organisation says it has \u201cin parallel made significant progress responding to the issues identified in the report\u201d and that progress has included \u201cactive steps to strengthen program governance and engagement with the ABS audit committee\u201d. The shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones said the ANAO assessment showed the government hadn\u2019t absorbed the lessons of 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake,\u201d Jones said. \u201cGood decision making in government needs good census data. Every aspect of government requires accurate data. For marginalised communities it\u2019s critical for health and education funding. For transport and infrastructure planning as well\u201d. \u201cThe Morrison government promised to fix the issues at the ABS, but haven\u2019t followed through, and when you slash funding for agencies like the ABS this is what happens\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
