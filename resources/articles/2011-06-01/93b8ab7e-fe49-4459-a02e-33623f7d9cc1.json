Produced by Dennis Bovell, Cut cooked up a restless, offbeat art-pop from fractured guitar, ever-shifting rhythms and the joyful polyglot patois of singer Ari Up, all itchy energy and fizzing with invention. Return of the Giant Slits (1981) stepped deeper into dub; Cut, meanwhile, still sounds unlike anything else, despite the countless followers it has inspired since."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
