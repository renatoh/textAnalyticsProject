An article on their union\u2019s website complained that \u201calmost no questions\u201d had been asked about the Springboks at their media conferences. \u201cJapan, Japan, Japan has been the focus of attention. Expect more of the same tomorrow.\u201d Memories of the 2015 upset in Brighton linger on. The situation is partly South Africa\u2019s fault for providing a Japanese interpreter for briefings where little or no English has been spoken. Only when there are players on parade such as the Tongan-born Uwe Helu, who does not speak Japanese, are translators provided for the English-speaking media. \u201cThey are a tier one country and we are tier two,\u201d said one official when asked why half the reporters in the room at Japan\u2019s hotel were not provided with a translation. The implication was that it came down to money \u2013 New Zealand and Australia have also provided an interpreter here \u2013 but South Africa are not a team to arm with a grievance. \u201cIf you have watched how we have played in the World Cup you can see how we will play on Sunday,\u201d said Matt Proudfoot, South Africa\u2019s forwards coach. \u201cIf you think it is going to be one-dimensional, then you have not noticed our evolution.\u201d When questioned about Brighton in 2015 \u2013 when Japan produced the greatest shock in a World Cup history by defeating South Africa \u2013 attention is deflected to last month in Kumagaya, where the Springboks won a warm-up game 41-7 against a team containing 11 of the starters who took the field last Sunday and beat Scotland last Sunday. \u201cWe know that most people want Japan to win,\u201d Proudfoot said. \u201cThis World Cup has been incredible and it is mind-blowing how efficient and well-presented this tournament has been. A passionate crowd will be against us, but it will be no different to playing in New Zealand or at Twickenham. I am already getting goose bumps thinking about it, not how the rest of the world wants us to get beaten.\u201d South Africa showed against Canada that they can play it fast and loose and will be able to call on their wing Cheslin Kolbe, a player who could easily fit into Japan\u2019s side, after recovering from an ankle injury. \u201cDynamite comes in small packages,\u201d said Kolbe when asked about his size. The crackdown on high tackles will benefit Japan because as defenders go lower, there will be greater opportunity for offloads and width. \u201cWe know we will need to outwit South Africa,\u201d said Helu. \u201cThey are a physical team and we have to be smarter in how we attack. \u201cWe know where the space is, how to identify defenders and exploit them. They are different to other teams in that they work as a group when they attack, coming at you in twos and threes. We will keep tackling and come at them every time.\u201d Every Japan player at this tournament has said the same thing: we trust our leaders and the game plan. \u201cWe have been very strictly coached in training,\u201d the hooker Atsushi Sakate said. Our reactions and decisions are very closely supervised.\u201d Which poses the question: can they think on their feet? South Africa intend to find out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
