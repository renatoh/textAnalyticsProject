Mr Disney, who resigned in December, was the last remaining member of the Walt Disney family on the company board. Comcast launched its surprise bid for the company independently of Mr Disney's push to replace Mr Eisner and three other board directors, a spokesman for the nephew of company founder Walt Disney told Reuters. The Comcast offer, which was initially valued at more than $54bn in stock, came today as Disney reported stronger quarterly results and executives of the film studio and theme park operator, including Mr Eisner, prepared to meet analysts in Orlando, Florida. Roy Disney let fire a stream of invective against the company's long standing chairman when he quit in December. In a blistering three-page letter he argued that under Mr Eisner, the company had \"lost its focus, its creative energy and its heritage\". Mr Disney, 73, protested that it should be Mr Eisner who was stepping down instead of himself. The company, he said, had become \"rapacious, soulless and always looking for the quick-buck\". The outburst was the result of a long simmering row between the two men over the control of the company. Mr Disney had been vice-chairman of the group and also served as chairman of the feature animation division. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
