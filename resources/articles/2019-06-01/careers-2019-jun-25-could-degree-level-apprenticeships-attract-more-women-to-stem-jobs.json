It is a worrying statistic that the government says it is trying to correct by making more young women aware of the wealth of opportunities opened up by a degree-level Stem apprenticeship. Lucy Rigler, deputy director at the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education, points out that, although the uptake seems low, there has been an improvement of 1% among women in the past four years. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do and so we are working with the Department for Education to help encourage more women on to these apprenticeships,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact they can earn as they learn and gain work experience is an important consideration for young women who want to progress in their careers.\u201d Much of the blame may lay with society and schools, according to Sarah Peers, deputy president at the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists, and adviser to the Institute of Innovation and Knowledge Exchange. \u201cGirls tend to choose fewer options around Stem, but this leaky pipeline starts earlier, with primary school children who are fed messages about their role in society,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to inspire teachers, parents and employers to understand these issues and understand why it is important to them. If your recruits and apprentices are mainly men, then you\u2019re missing out on the innovation talents of 50% of the population.\u201d Hajra Bibi counts herself as \u201cone of the lucky ones\u201d who heard about degree apprenticeships at school. She will finish a five-year degree course in applied bioscience this summer through a degree apprenticeship scheme at pharmaceuticals company GSK. She believes the role has given her more than university could have, and without the debt. \u201cI thought about university, but I chose to get my degree while earning so I wouldn\u2019t start my working life with huge debt,\u201d she says. \u201cThe great part of apprenticeships is that not only do you get a degree, but you\u2019ve got five years of experience in the industry. The sandwich year students we have here always comment on how they\u2019d have loved to graduate with so much experience and no debt. Many people haven\u2019t heard about apprenticeships or, if they have, don\u2019t realise how they\u2019ve now evolved to be comparable to going to university.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
