That is because the file is now being distributed as a Bittorrent download - meaning that it is distributed among hundreds or thousands of users who have already downloaded it, and can be retrieved by anyone using Bittorrent clients. The \"cablegate\" file containing the diplomatic files is already widely distributed via Bittorrent, the Guardian has established - meaning that they will be accessible, and downloadable, even if Wikileaks is not. The main site itself is moving back to the Bahnhof ISP in Sweden, according to DNS checking. The move was spotted by Alex Norcliffe: \"Moving to another host directly as a result of downtime would suggest unresolvable problems at Amazon. Considering no reports of outages at other Amazon-hosted sites are proliferating, you'd be forgiven for suspecting that this time it might just be personal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
