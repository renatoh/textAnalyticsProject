The duo, who recently left the BBC positions of creative head of factual entertainment and creative head of format respectively, are understood to have a personal stake in the new company, called Fever Media, with overall financial support provided by Sony BMG. A spokesman for Sony, the world's second largest recording group, insisted the contractual details remained \"private\". Mr Mortimer, 38, was at the BBC for 15 years, spending his last three years there as creative head of factual entertainment and overseeing an expansion into the American television market. In Mr Hopkins's three years in format entertainment at the BBC he was responsible for developing and producing a number of hit shows including the talent contest Strictly Come Dancing and the family advice programme The House of Tiny Tearaways. Sony BMG is a global recorded music joint venture owned equally by Bertelsmann and Sony. Its roster of artists includes Will Young, Britney Spears and Bob Dylan. The company's chairman and chief executive, Rob Stringer, said of the latest venture: \"David and Richard are highly experienced and talented entrepreneurial TV executives, and our deal will be creatively beneficial for both parties. Fever will be part of our ongoing vision to create a completely multidimensional entertainment company at Sony BMG.\" Mr Hopkins said: \"Working at the BBC has been an amazing creative experience and I will miss it a great deal, but the chance to combine forces with a talent like David Mortimer and take on the challenges of the independent world was too good to miss. It will also be fantastic to be able to take advantage of the music and new media knowhow of a company as innovative and influential as Sony BMG.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
