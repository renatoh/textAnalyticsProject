The Californian, who obtained a passport on July 7 thanks to his British-born mother Ava, only six weeks after thinking of the idea, was included in the 400 metres and 4x400m relay squad when Britain's team was finalised yesterday. Thomas was furious four years ago when, as the European champion and UK record holder, he was left out of the team for Sydney without being given a chance to prove his fitness. He did not achieve the qualifying time for the individual event in Athens but was expected to be named in the relay team. His confidence stemmed from his defeat of Sean Baldock, third in the Olympic trials earlier this month, in Madrid last Saturday in a time of 46.12sec. That was quicker than Matt Elias and Davis had run in Loughborough on the same day when they practically dead-heated in 46.30. Elias was also added to the relay team. \"Malachi saw a window there and did his best,\" said Thomas. \"It is not Malachi's fault - he has done his best to get in the team. \"But it is upsetting for me that I am British record holder and still part of the relay team that holds the European record but they did not choose me for the relay.\" Davis earned the right to join Tim Benjamin and Daniel Caines in the 400m when he ran inside the A-standard qualifying time of 45.55 by three-hundredths of a second at a meeting in Tucson, Arizona, in April. He has yet to repeat that form in his three races here, blaming jet lag and the cold weather. He had never left North America until he travelled to Manchester for the trials. \"People talk about the fact that he has done 45.50 in America,\" said Thomas. \"I have done 44.30. With all due respect to him, he has not shown that kind of ability. \"He was fifth in our trials, better than me, I admit, but I have not trained properly. He then was second in Loughborough and I think I can only get better now I'm over my injury. I feel I have been let down by the sport once again and feel empty, shell-shocked.\" Max Jones, the UK Athletics performance director, was again forced to defend the non-selection of Thomas. \"There were a lot of things to take into account,\" he said. \"Iwan finished sixth in his race, it was perfect conditions in Madrid, whereas at Loughborough there was a strong wind in the back straight. \"I can understand athletes thinking that it is not right that we have selected Davis ahead of them when they have been training here for four years. \"But he is eligible. Whether it is a week or two years, he is eligible. He was entitled to be selected and if we had not selected him on grounds of discrimination we could have been in trouble. \"I think Malachi is startled that it is such a big issue. Looking at the reaction of Chris Rawlinson and Caines and Benjamin, they are all delighted to have him.\" The relay squad is regarded as an outside bet for a medal in Athens. \"I've got my heart set [on winning a medal],\" said Davis. \"If I win a medal it's for all of Britain, definitely.\" Earlier Davis spoke of \"representing England\" before being reminded it was a British squad by his Scottish interviewer. \"Britain it is,\" he said. \"I'm extremely happy, I'm excited. It was definitely up in the air because I know there were quite a few athletes that were still part of the selection process.\" Davis is one of 11 athletes added to the original team of 47. Others included Dean Macey, in the decathlon after his successful return to action in Hexham last week, and Chris Tomlinson in the long jump. He is preferred to Nathan Morgan, who had the A-standard, but Tomlinson is considered the better medal prospect after winning the European Cup last month. \u00b7 The project to renovate the Crystal Palace athletics arena took a step forward yesterday when the new track at the stadium was officially opened in time for the Norwich Union London grand prix on Friday week. One of the star attractions at the meeting will be Maurice Greene, the Olympic 100 metres champion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
