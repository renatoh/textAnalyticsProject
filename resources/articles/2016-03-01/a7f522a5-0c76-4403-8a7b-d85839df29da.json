The emergence of Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy, who have 40 Premier League goals between them this season, and the manner of England\u2019s impressive attacking performance against Germany in Berlin on Saturday has prompted debate over whether Rooney should still command a place in Roy Hodgson\u2019s starting XI. The Manchester United striker is recovering from ligament damage to his right knee, sustained in a defeat at Sunderland last month, and although he has now started running again, he is unlikely to return to his club side until late April. Hodgson suggested on Sunday that it would be unfair for Rooney, who is England\u2019s record goalscorer with 51 and who will be a pundit in the ITV studio at Wembley for England\u2019s match against Holland on Tuesday night, to be \u201cjettisoned in some way\u201d in light of the progress made by Vardy and Kane. Vardy and Daniel Sturridge will start against Holland, with Barkley earning his 21st cap and providing a supply line from midfield in another inexperienced English selection. The Everton playmaker joined his manager in placing his support behind the absent captain, pointing out that Rooney\u2019s influence is felt just as keenly off the pitch as on it. \u201cWayne is the captain, he leads the side,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cHe has the experience and he passes it on to the younger lads in the squad, and he helps us younger lads around the place with the knowledge he has built up in the past tournaments and qualifying stages. That helps us all. \u201cI am still pretty new to this squad but the team mixes really well. The squad is a blend of young lads and a few experienced players. \u201cA few of us younger lads have mixed together in the national age groups over the years, so we know each other really well. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great bunch of lads and there are lots of options for the manager. We\u2019ve got a few lads who aren\u2019t even in the squad, like Wayne, and there are goals all around the squad. \u201cThat\u2019s good to see because we all know the goals we need can come from anywhere.\u201d Barkley had made an impressive cameo against Germany, entering the fray alongside Vardy 19 minutes from time, with the visitors trailing 2-1, and playing a part in the team\u2019s comeback, which was capped by Eric Dier\u2019s stoppage-time winner. \u201cAs a young team, that win will have done our confidence the world of good because we were playing against the world champions,\u201d Barkley added. \u201cTo have come from 2-0 down to win 3-2 will give us a lot of belief. It\u2019s great to see but we know we still have a lot to learn and that we have a lot of games before we get to the Euros. \u201cWe are staying level-headed and we know we have got to stay focused to keep improving.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
