Solomun Beyene, 24, from St John's Wood, north London, and Craig Calderwood, 26, of no fixed abode, are accused of \"conspiring with others\" to rob Graff jewellers in New Bond Street, central London. They have also been charged with a firearms offence. The pair will appear at Wimbledon magistrates court today. About \u00a340m of gems and jewellery were stolen during the armed raid at the store on 6 August.
