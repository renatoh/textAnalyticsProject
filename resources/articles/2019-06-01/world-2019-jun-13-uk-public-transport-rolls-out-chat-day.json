Commuters on West Coast Virgin trains will find every coach C is designated a \u201cchat carriage\u201d, while bus company Arriva is placing \u201cconversation starter\u201d cards on vehicles servicing their UK network. Transport for London, Greater Anglia and the Go Ahead Group are also all taking part, with posters at three London tube stations encouraging people to talk to staff. Counsellors trained by the charity Relate will ply London buses as part of an initiative with Greener Journeys, encouraging passengers to open up. National Express said it would invite people to take part in \u201csome stimulating activities\u201d on Birmingham\u2019s number 11 route, the longest urban bus route in Europe. The series of initiatives, orchestrated by a BBC team focused on solutions journalism, is designed to combat two of the most toxic issues of the age: polarisation and isolation. Emily Kasriel, a BBC editor behind the project, said the aim was \u201cto encourage people who are up for it to get out of their comfort zone and emerge from their screens to interact with the adult sitting next to them\u201d. \u201cMany people are reluctant to talk to strangers, but perhaps someone is battling loneliness and an exchange could provide a meaningful moment that changes their day,\u201d said Kasriel, the head of the BBC\u2019s Crossing Divides season, which seeks to combat antagonism through conversation. \u201cEveryone has an interesting story to tell. These chance encounters can provoke a new way of looking at the world, and an opportunity to understand someone else\u2019s story.\u201d Though typical commuter behaviour these days might involve inserting earbuds and avoiding all and any interaction with fellow travellers, research indicates that those who do open up to strangers tend to feel happier as a result. In a 2014 study led by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago, the authors wrote: \u201cConnecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other.\u201d In a blogpost for the BBC, Epley wrote that one reason why a sudden conversation might improve a day is that \u201cthe experience of talking with others and hearing a stranger\u2019s voice makes us realise they have a rich inner life of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences, just like us\u201d. He added: \u201cThese brief connections with strangers are not likely to turn a life of misery into one of bliss. However, they can change unpleasant moments \u2013 like the grind of a daily commute \u2013 into something more pleasant.\u201d Not everyone agrees. Last month, Uber started trialling a \u201cquiet driver\u201d mode to prevent drivers from striking up conversations on journeys.
