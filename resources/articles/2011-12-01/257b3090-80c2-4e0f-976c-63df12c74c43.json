Eschewing the usual method of repackaging of just-about-known-but-generally-ignored facts that traditionally make up an \"untold story\" of a star, it used recently unearthed letters, audiotapes, interview footage and, above all, his agent Miff Ferrie's meticulous records to reconstruct its subject in the round. The talent \u2013 and you don't have to find Cooper funny in order to see it \u2013 was beautiful. A lumbering giant of a man with a featherlight touch \u2013 for a trick, a fumble or a punchline \u2013 seemingly effortlessly snatching victory from the jaws of defeat from the jaws of victory. The turmoil behind the talent was less so. The film calmly and unflinchingly detailed the story of his alcoholism, which marched in lockstep with his professional success, his long affair with his personal assistant Mary Kay while married to Gwen \u2013 a woman he frequently hit when in his cups, and unpicked his love-hate \u2013 or possibly hate-hate \u2013 relationship with Ferrie. Ferrie was a control freak with, it was attested by several of Cooper's peers and most vociferously by another former client, Bruce Forsyth, no discernible sense of humour, but Cooper never quite broke ties with him. Perhaps he sensed that only a dour, iron-willed man like Ferrie could help him control the chaos of his life. And in return, Ferrie \u2013 who always wanted him to lose the fez \u2013 kept him working and his image intact for 40 years. He noted under the final entry in Cooper's booking diary: \"Died on stage.\" Usually metaphorical for a comedian, but not that night. A superb but sobering film. I mean, it is still Christmas, isn't it? What we really need is something a bit lighter, a bit brighter all round, you know? Wait ... wait, what's this? Oh, this is it! This, THIS is Christmas! Gather, please, all that turkey-stuffed family round, and let us all groan gently with gastro-pleasure and regret together while three and a half hours of addictively unwatchable television unfolds lavishly before us. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you \u2013 Ben Hur on Channel 5. And if you think I mean the 1959 William Wyler epic starring Charlton Heston, may I beg you for your own safety to stop and adjust your expectations so they rest somewhere markedly south of their previous position before you continue. Thank you. For this is the 2010 Ben Hur starring Joseph \"Wasn't he Mick Mabley in Doc Martin?\" Morgan as Ben Hur! Alex Kingston as his mother! Ben Cross as Tiberius (and still so handsome it hurts to look at him, I imagine, even if you haven't been in love with him since Chariots of Fire)! And a guest appearance by Ray Winstone as Consul Quintus Arrius! It is the kind of production that basically involves gathering up a lorryload of thesps at a loose end, dumping them in a tax-efficient sandy location, giving them a load of helmets to play with and a crash course in High Roman Speak, recording whatever results and scoring any emotional moments with sub-Enya (or possibly Enya \u2013 it's so hard to tell) music. Soap actors have panto. Proper Actors have this. It opens with Judah Ben Hur, scion of a wealthy Jewish merchant family, and his boyhood chum Messala (unacknowledged bastard son of a Roman senator) racing each other and crashing in their straw-filled carts. They laugh and drag the damaged one home. Alex Kingston's first line is: \"We don't waste chariots, you know!\" Messala is eventually recalled to Rome, where Ben Cross is playing Tiberius. Which, as he is 52 times even more handsome than in his Chariots of Fire days, is excellent news. When they next meet \u2013 sorry, I mean, When Next They Meet \u2013 Messala is dedicated to the glory of Rome and Ben Hur still down with the kidz of Judaea. Cue betrayal, corruption, humiliation (Messala's), arrest, three years of galley slavery, adoption by and then gargantuan inheritance from Quintus Arrius and a triumphant return to Judaea (Ben Hur's). After that, it's just a matter of shifting actors and plot points around until they have the chariot race, Messala can be mortally wounded and Ben Hur can forgive him on his deathbed because the chap who has kept bobbing up throughout \u2013 Jesus something? \u2013 fills his mind and makes him think it would be a good idea. The End. Smashingly ridiculous, ridiculously smashing. And thank God it comes but once a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
