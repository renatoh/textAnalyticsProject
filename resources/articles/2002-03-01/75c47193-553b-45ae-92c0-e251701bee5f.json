It must have been a peculiar sight, as huge men gathered around a little boat, set it on fire and pushed it out to sea. But inside the boat was a video of last October's grand final, in which Wigan were humiliated 37-6 by the Bulls. \"You've always got to face your demons,\" explained Stuart Raper, Wigan's coach. \"We watched a copy of the tape, which wasn't much fun for any of us, then put it to bed by pushing it out to sea.\" More relevant to tonight's match, and Wigan's prospects this season, may be the fact that Henry Paul is in Paris with England's rugby union squad. The elder Paul brother became pivotal to the Bulls in his three seasons with the club, perhaps irreplaceable. They have already won the World Club Championship without him, thrashing Newcastle Knights in a McAlpine Stadium deluge to launch the season. But the following week they crashed out of the Challenge Cup to Leeds, their first defeat at Valley Parade since moving out of Odsal, raising the stakes for Brian Noble's team at Wigan tonight. Life after Henry - and his fellow codebreakers Jason Robinson and Iestyn Harris - presents challenges for the Super League as a whole. They were undeniably three of the game's brightest talents, and three names that meant something to the sporting public south of Sheffield. But the game is fortunate in having a few natural successors. Sean Long is effectively a new player after missing most of last season with cruciate ligament damage that required a second knee reconstruction. In his absence his Saints team-mate Paul Sculthorpe stepped up as Super League's shining star, winning the Man of Steel award and being chosen by Sky Sports as the face of this year's television promotion. Now the combination of Sculthorpe, Long, Keiron Cunningham and Paul Wellens, their wonderfully composed young full-back, makes Saints a good bet at least to retain the Challenge Cup they won at Twickenham last year. Bradford have signed a huge Tongan volcano, Lesley Vainikolo, to appease their supporters after the loss of Paul, but it is the continuing development of Stuart Fielden, Jamie Peacock, Paul Deacon and Leon Pryce that holds greater significance for the British game. And Leeds have potentially the brightest, though not the biggest, star in Rob Burrow, the tiny teenage half-back who emerged from nowhere to be Super League's young player of 2001. The grand finalists again seem certain to come from the big four of Bradford, Leeds, Saints and Wigan. Hull and London Broncos are the two teams capable of upsetting that assumption, but the Broncos would need to steer freakishly clear of injuries and it is more likely that their nightmare draw will allow Castleford to squeeze ahead of them into the play-offs. Those have been expanded to involve the top six clubs just as the more complicated but much fairer top-five system was starting to be understood and accepted by a majority of fans. If that is one example of the game's continuing determination to shoot itself in the foot, so too is the big four's insistence on playing all their home games on Friday nights whether they are televised or not, leading to some distinctly unsexy Sunday programmes. Small wonder that Henry Paul's younger brother Robbie has prefaced this season with a call for league to sort itself out, or slowly die. He should not be ignored, but that warning is unduly alarmist. There are so many good things about the game, from the return of Peter Fox as football manager at Wakefield to St Helens' use of Johnny Vegas in their local radio promotions - although Vegas does not have quite so many snappy one-liners. Best of all, there is the genuine unpredictability at the top of the table. Even Sky TV's Stevo, who does not normally mind making a fool of himself, is reluctant to tip the champions this season - but maybe this is the year that Wigan's boat will come in. \u00b7 Leeds have postponed their opening match against the London Broncos at Headingley from tonight to 3pm on Sunday because of storm damage to the main stand. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
