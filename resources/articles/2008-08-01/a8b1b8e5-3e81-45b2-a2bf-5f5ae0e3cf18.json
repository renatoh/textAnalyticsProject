The Southampton four-piece rampage through a revolving door of rhythms, turn Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake into an indie requiem and beat famous fan Lily Allen at her own game with the perfect, primary-coloured pop of Blas\u00e9. Thomas's vocals have the sweetness of Lykke Li and the sourness of Kate Nash, a combination that works both on the catchy, attitude and repetition-driven What What What and Shake It! Shake It! and the Art Brutish Why the English Are Rubbish, during which she pouts in French. Slower songs like the haunting Trust Rhymes With Crust reveal mature melodies and curious stories but all that foot-stamping leaves Thomas Tantrum as exhausting as they are intriguing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
