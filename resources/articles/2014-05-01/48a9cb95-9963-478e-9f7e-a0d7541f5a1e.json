Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, who was facing questions from MPs on the first of two days of parliamentary hearings into the planned takeover, said that \"there will be some job cuts\" despite repeated assurances that the takeover would be \"win-win\" for the UK. Read eventually conceded the combined R&amp;D budget of the two businesses would be reduced after Labour's Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business select committee, told him that Pfizer was known as a \"praying mantis\" and \"a shark that needs feeding\". Read said there would be redundancies around the world, but refused to say where: \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs. What I can't tell you is how much or how many or where.\" The only guarantee that the Scotland-born Read was prepared to give was Pfizer's previously made pledge that 20% of the combined R&amp;D workforce would be based in Britain for the next five years. \"That's a substantial commitment,\" he said. \"I intend to honour those commitments \u2026 I'm a man of my word. \"Once the deal is completed, we will look at the global spend and decide where is the best place for science, and the UK has a great science infrastructure.\" David Cameron has made it clear he wants to see better guarantees from Pfizer, and the business secretary, Vince Cable, has refused to rule out intervention in the bid, while admitting it would be \"tricky\". Cable also appeared before the MPs and said Read's pledges must be more specific. \"The key issue is that they would have to be meaningful and binding,\" he said. Pfizer has previously made cost savings when deals have been completed. After its three previous big acquisitions \u2013 US firms Wyeth and Warner-Lambert and Sweden's Pharmacia \u2013 there were laboratory closures and more than 60,000 job losses. AstraZeneca has repeatedly rejected Pfizer's offers as significantly undervaluing the company. The UK firm's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, told MPs on Tuesday that the proposed deal risked disrupting or delaying the development of life-saving drugs. \"In research, big is not necessarily beautiful,\" he said. He told the committee: \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because, in the meantime, our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" But on Tuesday night he told BBC Newsnight he was not ruling out recommending a deal. \"We will consider proposals, offers that are made to us in the context of the value, the price that's offered and the potential of the terms,\" he said. \"But certainly the price that is offered is a very important dimension.\" Read refused to make a longer-term commitment despite warnings from leading scientists. Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, said in a letter to the committee that Pfizer must make a 10-year commitment to the UK. Unions representing AstraZeneca's 6,700 UK staff told the hearing Pfizer's five-year pledge was \"paper thin\" and \"remarkably short-term\". They want a 25-year pledge. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the Pfizer comments \"reinforced Labour's grave concerns about this potential takeover and confirmed the worst fears of the British business and science community about its impact\". Read, however, said Britain should welcome the opportunity to have the world's largest pharmaceutical company relocate its tax base to the UK. He said it would be very beneficial to the Exchequer, even though the substantial tax benefits would come at the expense of US taxpayers. The company will make big tax savings by spending the \u00a340bn cash pile it has built up outside the US on buying AstraZeneca rather than taking the money back to America. If the cash was repatriated to the US, it would be taxed at 27%, compared with 20% in the UK from next year. While Pfizer finance chief Frank D'Amelio declined to spell out the likely tax savings, but said the New York-based pharma giant would not relocate to the UK without the AstraZeneca deal (US rules require for \"tax inversion\" that at least 20% of the company is in non-US ownership). The contentious tax plans have been attacked in the US, by prominent senators Carl Levin and Roy Wyden, who are working to close the loophole. Read made clear that tax savings were one of the main drivers of the proposed deal. \"We would change the price we are offering if we didn't have the advantage of the tax,\" he said. He highlighted the UK's \"patent box\", introduced by chancellor George Osborne, which allows companies to pay just 10% tax on products derived from UK research. Soriot warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\". However, it emerged later in the hearing that AstraZeneca paid no corporate taxes last year because its operations in the UK made a loss. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" The French-born Australian also warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\". It then emerged that while AstraZeneca paid corporate taxes of \u00a31.5bn in the last five years (plus \u00a31bn in employee taxes), it paid none last year, because its operations in the UK made a loss. Away from the hearings, Pfizer made a direct appeal to shareholders that it should be allowed to buy the British firm. In a statement to the City, Pfizer said it \"remains disappointed at the lack of engagement by the AstraZeneca board\". AstraZeneca dismissed Pfizer's statement and Soriot told MPs that his company was better off alone: \"We have the scale, we have the people, we have the talent, we have the products, we are confident we can succeed.\" However, after the hearing, he indicated that AstraZeneca's board would be open to a deal if Pfizer substantially increased its offer. The US group is widely expected to raise its proposal above the current \u00a350-a-share offer. Heads you 'own it' Ian Read, the Scottish-born accountant who runs the biggest drug firm in the US carries in his pocket a special gold coin, about the size and weight of a \u00a32 piece. On one side it reads \"Straight talk\", the other says \"Own it\". The Pfizer boss told bemused MPs the coin is a symbol of Pfizer's corporate culture. If someone in the company wants to have a direct conversation, they flash the coin. \"I believe strongly that everybody in the company needs to have a sense of ownership\", he explained. \"Hence \"own it\", and to own it we need the ability to do straight talk.\" Tory MP Brian Binley, who asked Read to produce the coin, then delivered some straight talk of his own, telling Read he hadn't been straight enough with the committee. \"I believe you spun it this morning and got 'Own it'. We haven't had the straight talk we need,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
