If form and sharpness are the determining factors, David Connolly looks the obvious choice. The Republic of Ireland's liveliest forward in a friendly draw against Turkey last month, Connolly is also the only striker in the squad who is regularly starting and scoring at club level. Though most of the 26-year-old's eight goals have come in the relatively soft surrounds of the First Division with West Ham, he showed top-flight quality with his score against Turkey. Given that Clinton Morrison has been almost permanently on the bench for Birmingham City and Gary Doherty has not played for Spurs since the opening day, Connolly would seem well placed to start a qualifier which Ireland must win to be sure of a top-two spot. Kerr does have the option of deploying Damien Duff alongside Keane, but he is expected to use the Chelsea player in midfield to supplement the threat of a front two. In any event, the Duff-Keane pairing was not a success in Albania. If Connolly gets the nod, expectation will be high. Some feel he owes his country after being sent off in the second leg of the France 98 play-off against Belgium, which Ireland lost 2-1. He was then among the players who failed to score in the shoot-out with Spain at the 2002 World Cup. Connolly has since started only one competitive international, but said: \"Hopefully my performance [against Turkey] will get me into the side for the match against the Swiss. It's a huge game and everyone wants to be involved.\" Kerr was upset to miss training, which Keane sat out as a precaution with a knee problem, though it is not causing alarm. \"Typical Brian, he didn't want to be confined to bed,\" said his No2 Chris Hughton. \"But we thought it was best that he wasn't around the players.\" Swizerland could be without the midfielder Hakan Yakin because of an ankle injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
