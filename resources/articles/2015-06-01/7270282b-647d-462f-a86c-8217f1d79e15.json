Under his leadership, the New York Philharmonic has become adept at staging fully realised, persuasive operatic productions inside the squeezed-for-space confines of Avery Fisher Hall. Though in addition to becoming the stuff of New York high-culture legend, the orchestra\u2019s recent productions of stage works by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek have also set a high bar \u2013 one that the organization\u2019s imported, season-closing production of the Arthur Honegger oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake occasionally had trouble meeting on its premiere on Wednesday night (it runs through 13 June). Gilbert and the orchestra were in typically engaged form, savoring every weird twist of Honegger\u2019s impressively oddball orchestral music (which was written in 1935 and then revised in 1944). When given the appropriate stage space with which to work, the guest star, Oscar-winning actor Marion Cotillard, was frequently magnetic in the spoken part of Joan. The night began and ended well, in large part due to Cotillard\u2019s gripping presence, and her solid interaction with Gilbert, the orchestra and the two choruses on hand (specifically, New York Choral Artists and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus). Early on, Cotillard\u2019s chanting of the epithets used to condemn her \u2013 \u201cHeretic! Sorceress! Apostate!\u201d\u2013 rested atop the chorus\u2019s recitation of the same words with a ghostly, truly musical power. And whenever Cotillard\u2019s Joan was in dialogue with the character of Brother Dominique \u2013 a spectral figure who appears just before her march to the fiery stake, and who prompts the memories that give the oratorio its reverse-chronological, flashback structure \u2013 the drama was clear and engaging. Yet for long stretches in the middle of the 80-minute piece, director C\u00f4me de Bellescize\u2019s staging seemed like it couldn\u2019t quite figure out how it wanted to approach Honegger\u2019s richly variegated score, which scoops up a variety of early-modernist trends (sometimes smash-cutting between Euro-atonality, earthy folk song and jazz age-inflected strutting in the space of a few seconds). While it\u2019s true that a certain cynicism is afoot, at times, both in the score and in librettist Paul Claudel\u2019s abstracted narrative design \u2013 which includes a trial of Joan that is staged by animals (and adjudicated by a pig) \u2013 there\u2019s also a heavy moral and religious cast to the proceedings that is, ultimately, meant to be taken seriously. (The Philharmonic\u2019s production even ends with all the members of the chorus and orchestra holding up little candles: a thousand points of Joan-referencing light.) But once you\u2019ve actually put the trial-scene adjudicator in a adult-sized pig costume, and likewise directed the skilled tenor Thomas Blondelle to ham it up to the hilt, it\u2019s a challenge to navigate the proceedings back in the direction of profundity. In a director\u2019s note published in the Philharmonic\u2019s program, De Bellescize admits that a long passage which adduces some obscure history \u201cis hard to understand even for a French audience\u201d. But his cute-overload decision to deck out the Brooklyn Youth Chorus (which sang brilliantly) in brightly colored clothes (and to push them to the front of the stage for the duration of this lengthy scene) seemed an under-thought solution to the dramatic challenge being posed by Honegger and Claudel. And while Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise member Christian Gonon\u2019s expressions were often good for comic relief (in a sometimes dour work), the great number of characters he had to play, in Joan\u2019s various memories, were not always as distinct from one another as they might have been. Eventually, the oratorio returns Joan to the center of the proceedings and sends her to the fire \u2013 and it\u2019s here that this production gets back on track. Joan\u2019s interactions with her patron saints, Marguerite and Catherine, were affecting (and greatly assisted by the fine singing of Simone Osborne and Faith Sherman). At one moment toward the end, as the stage lighting saturated the house in a blood-red tint, Cotillard engaged in a potent bit of physical business \u2013 seemingly pushing back against the whole of the auditorium when issuing Joan\u2019s most prideful lines (\u201cIt is I who saved France!\u201d), while the chorus called for her to be \u201cconsumed by fire\u201d. And even if you know that Gilbert likes to push the Philharmonic to ferocious, brassy extremes (especially in modern music), you still might not be prepared for the thundering climax that the orchestra delivers in this piece. Even if the evening isn\u2019t quite the same sort of unqualified success that the Philharmonic\u2019s previous operatic presentations have primed us to expect, there\u2019s still a lot of power in this presentation of Honegger\u2019s Joan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
