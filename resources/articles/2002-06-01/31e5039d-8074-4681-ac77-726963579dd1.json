But England mustn't go into tomorrow's game thinking their opponents are invincible and there are a couple of areas I think we can exploit. If Michael Owen and Emile Heskey show enough determination and are clever with their movement, they could enjoy success against Argentina's back line. They have the pace to frighten them but it will have to be cunning pace and there's one particular tactic I would employ. Because Argentina play with a back three Owen and Heskey could find room behind the wing-backs if they approach things right. I'd ask the Liverpool pair to make darting runs off the ball from narrow positions out wide, where they can pick up possession and use their speed and power down the outside of the centre-backs. It's crucial, though, that they time their runs sensibly. The key is to hold the run a bit and look to escape Argentina's close attentions with a sudden sprint. Even if they're still tracked, their movement should open other options. England's man on the ball ought then to be able to change the angle of his pass and feed a ball into the feet of the second striker, who's pulled towards him. That way we could find ourselves getting one against one with the insurance man in the middle of their back three. What's vital is that England make more intelligent runs than against Sweden and hold possession a lot better. If we throw the ball forward aimlessly again, Argentina will come back at us with a far greater threat. Although Darius Vassell was the best of the three who played up front on Sunday, I'd leave him out. It will take a real partnership to undo Argentina and that Heskey-Owen combination has served Liverpool quite well and is the one England have hung their hat on in the qualifiers. Working as a pair is important because the strikers will have to make runs off each other, stretching Argentina's defence and using dummy sprints to create space for one another. If they just stand there and invite balls to feet they'll be easily closed down. Playing with a front two, rather than a three, will also help because the strikers will find more room. With a three, it can block the space the other two want to run into and make it harder to be clever with your movement. England can take heart from the chances that Nigeria created against Argentina and I think set-plays are another area we could exploit. We do fairly well from corners and free-kicks and I don't think defensively that's Argentina's strong point. Sol Campbell, besides his goal with a header against Sweden, had another disallowed against Argentina at France 98. You're looking for the likes of him and Rio Ferdinand to get in there and you are guaranteed quality delivery if David Beckham plays. The issue of Beckham's fitness is vital. If we're not totally sure he can do a minimum of an hour we have to leave him out, and the same goes for the other players returning from injury. We can't carry passengers. Argentina have a lot of quality but they'll also be prepared to put in a few reducers to test for any physical weaknesses. We can't have any milky, flimsy people in there. We need to be strong. Eriksson has his hardest decision as England manager. He has to make sure everyone he plays is spot on. We can't afford to vacate midfield as we did against Sweden because we'll be cut to ribbons. Argentina confirmed against Nigeria that, once ahead, they can take the heat out of a game. That's why it is very important England set out to be solid. The attitude has to be that we must not lose because a draw might be good enough if we beat Nigeria. I would switch to a back three, with Gareth Southgate playing between Ferdinand and Campbell, to give us the best chance of staying strong. But whatever the formation, we have to be focused and not concede needless free-kicks. To get anything, we must give a better performance than anything so far under Eriksson. It won't be another Germany game. There will be limited opportunities and we'll have to be ruthless. If Sunday's lessons are learned, and Owen and Heskey are cunning, it can be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
