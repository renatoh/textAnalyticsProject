It is a screen version of Gilbert Adair's semi-autobiographical novel, and Adair himself has written a terrifically clever and agile screenplay, replete with stylish variations on Cocteau, Godard and Truffaut. Since Last Tango in Paris in 1972, Bertolucci has had a reputation for showing obsessive sex in claustrophobic, enclosed spaces and this is a distant cousin to that fantasy, though coloured with innocence and idealism. It is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois in a very French vein: Michael Pitt is an American boy who comes to Paris in the turbulent late 1960s and becomes a devoted cinephile, religiously attending the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, and witnessing the demos. He befriends a beautiful twin brother and sister, Theo and Isabelle (played by newcomers Louis Garrel and Eva Green, who artlessly project the look of a distant Belmondo and Moreau). They invite him to stay in their rambling city apartment while their parents are away in the country and soon the three of them simply never leave, babes in an erotic wood of their own construction, ignoring the history being made out in the streets. The Dreamers looks and sounds and feels great. The three central performances have, by turns, the unselfconscious languour and intensity of extreme youth and the Paris conjured by Bertolucci and his production designer Jean Rabasse is not disgraced by the movie's ample quotations from celluloid classics. This was a tonic. As for Emma Thompson and Antonio Banderas in Christopher Hampton's Imagining Argentina - well, what can I say about something destined to be a cult classic of awfulness? Imagining Argentina is an excruciatingly misjudged attempt to impose a layer of occult spirituality on an important political subject: the abduction and murder of 30,000 dissidents by the fascist Argentine junta in the 1970s and 80s. Banderas plays a theatre director; his journalist wife is played by Emma Thompson, complete with Spanish accent. She is taken away by the sadistic secret police and then Banderas discovers he has the clairvoyant power to see what is happening to all the \"disappeared ones\"; he sees owls and visions, and regularly convenes a kind of s\u00e9ance to tell the grief-stricken relatives what is happening. The spectacle of Banderas exercising his sensitive magic powers, intercut with Thompson getting horribly raped and beaten - with close-ups on her droll, quizzical face contorted in agony - is truly wince-making. It reaches a nadir when their daughter is abducted and gets the same treatment and we see distraught Antonio mournfully strumming on his guitar, El Mariachi-style. The mystical spin on real-life political tragedy may have worked in the original novel, but here, defying tyrants while being away with the fairies just doesn't work. PB Moritz de Hadeln, director of the 60th festival, warned us long before his programme was complete not to expect too much after the disappointments of Cannes. He knew that several of the blue riband prospects that couldn't be completed in time for Cannes would not be ready for Venice either. To make matters worse, Jane Campion sent her new film to Toronto. Halfway through the festival, however, and after a slow start, things looked distinctly promising. And it was that old festival favourite Takeshi Kitano, actor, writer and television personality as well as director, who livened everyone up. If Woody Allen's Anything Else, in which he more or less plays himself, opened the festival with a minor flourish, Kitano's Zatoichi, which might best be described as the first samurai musical, had the press cheering. Inspired by the 1962 Kenji Misumi classic about a blind swordsman that spawned some two dozen sequels, it has Kitano as the white-haired veteran samurai who is still capable of dispatching a dozen assailants just by listening to their likely moves. The fights are as funny as they are bloody but Kitano's best trick is to accomplish the shafts of humour without turning the melodrama into mere parody. Added to that, we have workers in the paddy fields tap-dancing in the mud and a finale that suggests that Kitano must have seen Riverdance. The old man's last words to a delighted audience are \"the more you open your eyes, the less you see\" - a moral that probably fits life more than the film itself. Another hot ticket was the Coen brothers' Intolerable Cruelty, a star-studded screwball that had its audience baying approval during its first half but couldn't quite sustain the enthusiasm during its second. Hailed as the brothers' most commercial offering yet, it seems likely to please their legion of fans without getting quite as far with mainstream audiences as something such as Fargo. Perhaps the screenplay is a little too clever for its own good, piling on so many jokes in each sequence, many of them visual, that a certain indigestibility kicks in. George Clooney, whose cool style suits this sort of work very well, plays a rich and successful divorce attorney from LA who falls for Catherine Zeta-Jones's scheming divorcee having skilfully prevented her grabbing most of the estate of her rich philandering husband. She ends up with nothing but her court opponent's love. The twists and turns of a complicated plot allow the Coens to have enormous fun with the high-flying LA scene, and no one minds very much if the proceedings are at times yards over the top. And if Intolerable Cruelty is a spiteful movie, with not much belief in the gentler elements of human nature, it certainly bears the mark of two of the most skilful film-makers in America. Shortly afterwards came a debut film certain to gain an award. Snaffled from under the annoyed nose of the Locarno festival, Andrej Zvjagintsev's The Return is an outstanding first film which must have a favourite's chance of at least one prize. It is about two young boys who live in poverty with their mother and suddenly find their long-absent father has returned home. Gruff but clearly trying to establish contact with them, he takes the boys on a fishing trip, during which the elder boy grows to admire him but the younger remains obstinately doubtful and even hostile. We guess something terrible is going to happen and it duly does. But the film is so well directed, shot and acted, especially by the boys, that the tension is kept right up to the end. This is a class film in every respect and puts some of the bigger, more publicised movies here to shame. DM"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
