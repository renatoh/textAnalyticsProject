In the book, Free, Melania, CNN correspondent Kate Bennett also writes that the first lady \u201cstill refuses to believe\u201d her husband played a role in the release. Bennett also adds to reports that the president and first lady keep separate bedrooms at the White House. Free, Melania: The Unauthorised Biography will be published on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy. In statements to the Guardian, Stone denied Bennett\u2019s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book. The pictures, from a 1996 photoshoot and published by a French magazine the following year, found their way into the New York Post on 30 July 2016, three months out from election day and as Donald Trump was embroiled in an ugly spat with the family of Capt Humayun Khan, a US soldier killed in Iraq in 2004. At the time, Stone had no formal role with the Trump campaign, having left it in August 2015. But he remained close to Trump, himself a past master in using his personal life to generate tabloid publicity, often as a means of distraction. \u201cThe theory goes,\u201d Bennett writes, \u201cthat Trump was trying to head off a bad week on the campaign.\u201d Stone has had a bad month. In mid-November, he was found guilty of obstructing the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He is now awaiting sentencing. Trump heads into the 2020 election under the shadow of an impeachment inquiry related to his conduct in foreign policy. He also faces the prospect of prosecution when he leaves office, regarding a range of potential offences, among them pay-offs to a porn star and a Playboy model who claim to have slept with him while he was married to Melania. He denies the affairs but the payments have been confirmed, and Trump allegedly played a direct role in them. \u201cThis time,\u201d Bennett writes of the release of the photos, \u201cthe idea that [Trump] would throw his naked wife under the bus was almost so gross and salacious, and the photos so B-movie bad, the press ultimately spent very little time discussing them. \u201cMelania has not commented on how she thinks they got into the hands of the tabloid and on to the cover, but friends say she still refuses to believe Trump would do that to her. As for Stone, she\u2019s not so sure.\u201d In a statement emailed to the Guardian, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cMrs Trump is surprised at Kate Bennett\u2019s reporting. Our office worked with Kate in good faith on her book, and thought she would do an honest job. Sadly, it includes many false details and opinions, showing Ms Bennett spoke to many anonymous people who don\u2019t know the first lady. \u201cIt continues to be disappointing when people, especially journalists, write books with false information just to profit off the first family.\u201d It is widely believed that Trump will eventually pardon Stone. After the Guardian contacted him for comment on Monday, Stone\u2019s wife, Nydia, sent by text a statement which she requested be printed in full. It read: \u201cThe suspicion asserted in Kate Bennett\u2019s book is categorically false and completely illogical. My husband and I have known Melania since she began dating the president. We adore her and think she is doing a phenomenal job as first lady. \u201cThis ludicrous claim is an obvious attempt to drive a wedge between my husband and the president whom he has supported so loyally for the last 30 years. No one supported the president\u2019s election more strongly than Roger Stone, and the leaking of anything that would damage his prospects of being elected makes no sense whatsoever. Kate Bennett works for CNN and therefore nothing she reports can be believed.\u201d In 2016, Trump brushed off the controversy, telling the New York Post the photographs were \u201ctaken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania\u201d, at a time when his wife \u201cwas one of the most successful models and she did many photoshoots, including for covers and major magazines\u201d. \u201cIn Europe,\u201d Trump said, \u201cpictures like this are very fashionable and common.\u201d A campaign spokesman told CNN there was \u201cnothing to be embarrassed about\u201d. Other nude pictures of Melania Trump, taken on Trump\u2019s plane, were published in GQ magazine in 2000. Trump himself \u201crequested that photographs be delivered to his office\u201d, the magazine said in 2016. Bennett writes that the episode left Melania \u201chumiliated, defeated, embarrassed and scared for her young son\u201d. \u201cThen came Access Hollywood,\u201d she continues, in reference to the scandal in which a tape emerged of Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women, \u201cand the dam broke.\u201d Bennett is a sympathetic biographer, crediting the first lady with \u201ccomplete, 360-degree understanding\u201d that \u201celevates [her] beyond the stereotype\u201d of a former model and noting she is \u201ckind and warm\u201d to her White House staff. Bennett also reports that people \u201cwho have spent time with\u201d Melania and Donald Trump\u2019s son Barron report that the 13-year-old has \u201ca slight Slovenian accent\u201d. Free, Melania has been trailed by CNN and the New York Times, which noted how Melania\u2019s Republican convention speech came to include passages from a speech by Michelle Obama and a relationship with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, which is described as \u201ccordial, not close\u201d. The book also says the first lady has her own bedroom in the White House, which was first reported by Michael Wolff in his bestseller Fire and Fury; that a lengthy hospital stay in May 2018 was \u201cnot minor\u201d and involved \u201ca dangerous and complicated procedure\u201d to treat a kidney problem; that Melania\u2019s \u201cBe Best\u201d youth initiative amounts to very little; and that the first lady does not get along with Karen Pence, the wife of Vice-President Mike Pence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
