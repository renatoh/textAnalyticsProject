Perhaps less predictably, however, the most common regret expressed was not having learned how to play a musical instrument. More than not having paid attention at school, it seems, or not having done the right thing by a relationship, the number one sorrow was a lack of musical ability. You might think that such a result would be seized upon by politicians - particularly now that lip service, at least, is being paid to our quality of life. You might even wonder if music might be given some priority in the constant tampering with our education system. So far, however, there is no sign. Most comprehensives, already heaving unsteadily at their brims, barely have time to manoeuvre their students through the latest targets and curriculum hoops, let alone familiarise them with anything so outdated as classical music. This, despite the fact that research has shown that children who learn a musical instrument earn, on average, half a grade higher at GCSE than those who don't. For classical music is neither cool nor, apparently, hoop-shaped. My own daughter keeps quiet at school about her classical violinist mother for fear of derision. If her friends were made to listen to a piece of classical music, she says, they would simply laugh. I don't know which I find sadder: that she might genuinely dislike so-called classical music, or that she just feels obliged to say so. Disappointing enough, perhaps, that she has a dinosaur for a mother whose last few melodious gasps should be taken furtively. Yet few would argue that classical music still provides one of the most effective means of teaching musical literacy and a diverse range of instruments. Its training ground produces some of the best film and theatre music writers today, as well as many talented pop and rock musicians. Gifted young British instrumentalists and composers continue to survive, though not without a struggle. Meanwhile millions around the world are still inspired. What is regrettable is that one adjective can lead to such generic dismissal, vast swaths of great art discounted through one flick of the tongue. And in our brand-loving age, labels stick. Lacking fashion sense, though not for want of trying, classical music has become synonymous merely with yesterday's elitism. So thoroughly stigmatised has it become, in fact, so effectively demarcated, that it seems, like Latin, an alien, long defunct language. And several centuries of great music have become marginalised from mainstream culture and education in a way that the broader spectrum of literature or fine arts have not. Granted, classical music is often longer and more complex than \"pop\" music, but there is no other great stumbling block to its appreciation. In what other area of learning would we discount all that is not brief and straightforward? There would, on these grounds, be little left. Despite our increasingly results-orientated age, however, there are many who still believe passionately in the less quantifiable value of music. And there is growing recognition for projects such as the Venezuelan El Sistema, which uses classical music to change the lives of underprivileged children. The project is phenomenally successful: today it boasts 250,000 Venezuelan young participants, it has transformed countless lives and its main orchestra is lauded as a national asset. In Scotland recently a charitable trust set up the first counterpart in Raploch, Stirling, one of Britain's most deprived communities. Richard Holloway, chairman of the Scottish Arts Council, says classical music is transformative because it \"inspires collegiality and passion - things these communities lack\". The same music deemed inaccessible to our young, best left on a dusty shelf along with Lady Grey tea and smelling salts, is being recognised as a powerful tool with which to transform young lives. Although it may be too late for British adults unable to play instruments, we would surely hope more for the young. Sadly, not yet - cutbacks have made it harder for a British child to learn an instrument today. So has the time come, finally, for our government to begin taking music more seriously? The art of listening has to be learned, after all. \u00b7 Philippa Ibbotson is a freelance violinist philippaibbotson@tiscali.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
