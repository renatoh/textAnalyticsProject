'They are so cheap now that people who never smoked Marlboro before are switching brands,' she said. 'The trouble is that I have to sell them for less than I paid for them. If it carries on like that, we'll be closing down.' If these are confusing days for Spanish smokers, they are more so for estanco owners and, indeed, for anyone with shares in the Spanish-French tobacco giant Altadis or its rivals. A government crackdown on smoking has, bizarrely, provoked an increase in cigarette sales. Attempts to curb smoking by raising taxes have not only failed but had a reverse effect. The reason is simple. A vicious price war has broken out. Taxes may have gone up, but cigarettes have not been so cheap for ages. Nor have they been less profitable. The battle started well before socialist Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace at the beginning of last month. A leap in tobacco taxes last year was countered by manufacturers with the mass launch of new, cheaper brands. Sales increased by 0.5 per cent, bucking a long-running downward trend in a country where 31 per cent of people still smoke. The so-called 'cheap brands' increased their market share from 9.5 per cent to 28 per cent in just one year. The finance ministry reacted last month with a second tax hike. Altadis, which produces the pungent 'black' Ducados cigarettes, hoisted its prices accordingly. (Ducados is said to be the favoured brand of Spain's most prominent secret smoker - Zapatero). But Philip Morris slashed prices by up to 20 per cent. With Marlboro cheaper than its quality Fortuna brand, Altadis had to cut prices too. For those estanco owners who had bought in supplies at a higher wholesale price, the damage was obvious. Last week they rebelled, with many joining an unofficial strike by shutting shop for 'emergency stock-taking'. So, who can save them? Step in, once more, the government. It's latest pledge (or rumoured one, anyway) is to maintain minimum prices for even the cheapest brands at above \u20ac1 a pack. Perhaps, though, the estancos need not worry. With budget airfares from Britain now so low, 'tobacco flights' could start up. At \u20ac2.35 a pack, after all, you can now buy three Spanish Marlboros for the price of a British one. Even that, however, may not do the job. 'We don't want Spain to become the estanco of Europe,' says health minister Elena Salgado. So stock up on your Spanish fags now, because if the manufacturers do not up the price, the government will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
