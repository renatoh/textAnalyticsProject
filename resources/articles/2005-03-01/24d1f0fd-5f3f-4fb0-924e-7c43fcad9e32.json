Not just Michelle Pfeiffer's favourite designer but also the nickname of footballer Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Greece's equivalent to Beckham. Impress fellow holidaymakers by telling them he earned the title by strutting his sultry 6ft 3in stuff on the catwalk as a fashion model. More inexplicably, in January he traded in his place on Greece's sunkissed Panathinaikos team for a stint in Glasgow with Rangers. B is for Boutique chic. Greece isn't just about quaint villas, multi-storey hotels and privately rented rooms. Boutique hotels are breeding, especially on what has become the coolest island, Mykonos. The Mykonos Theoxenia (00 30 22890 22230; www.mykonostheoxenia.com) is cream of the crop, with retro orange and turquoise interiors, four-poster sunbeds and Venetian-style cocktail bars. C is for Camping. Combined with island-hopping, this is the classic way to do Greece: generations of students have slept on beaches or locals' roofs. Backpackers are keeping the tradition alive but risk being moved on by police. Thomas Cook's Greek Island Hopping 2005 (Thomas Cook Publishing, \u00a312.99) is the bible, and you can now book ferries in advance with ViaMare (0870 410 6040; www.viamare.com), crossings from \u00a310. D is for Dream-sharing. The doyenne of alternative holidays, the Skyros Centre (020 7267 4424; www.skyros.co.uk), on the island of Skyros, offers a huge range of personal development courses including yoga, dance, meditation and music, as well as creative writing, Greek cookery and 'shamanic wisdom'. The 'soul music' course in June costs from \u00a3485 per week and aims to increase 'life energy'. Men take note: single women outnumber men by three to one. E is for Ellinka , which means Greek in Greek. Learn to say things like ' opa! ' (whoops), ' po-po-po! ' (equivalent of French ooh la la!) and ' malaka ' (a rude word) with Teach Yourself Greek Complete Course - With Two Cassettes by Aristarhos Matsukas, published by McGraw Hill for \u00a324.15. Other books to pack (and display prominently by the pool) include Petros Markaris's The Late-night News (Random House, \u00a310.99) and The Maze by Panos Karnezis (Vintage - see back page). F is for Faliraki. The Rhodes resort became the Ayia Napa of 2003, best known for its drunken Brits, sexual shenanigans in the street and tacky clubs. Although the authorities tightened up drink regulations last summer, it's still quite 'lively': bars can now give away 'only' one free drink per person. G is for Gods and Gorges. The north of Greece is more rugged, rural and mountainous than the south, and is only just starting to attract more enterprising tourists. Walks Worldwide (01524 242000; www.walksworldwide.com) has a new eight-day Mount Olympus trip, passing the 3,000 metre-high mountain of the Greek gods and trekking through the sheer cliffs of Vithos Gorge. Trips start in June and cost from \u00a3995 including flights, accommodation and meals. H is for Hairy chests. No Greek god is complete without his chest rug. Despite the country's adoption of the trendy urban lifestyle, Mr Greece metrosexual is resisting the call of the waxing salon. This is one Greek fashion that refuses to go away. I is for Ios, one of the Cyclades in the Aegean, which has long had a reputation as the most hedonistic Greek island. A hippie hangout in the Sixties, it's still a fixture on the international backpacking circuit, and with no airport has managed to avoid being over-run with drunken Union Jack types. Stay at the Far Out Beach Club (00 30 22860 91468; www.faroutclub.com), which is said to be 'fun' and party on Mylopotas Beach. The island is on its way upmarket though: the authorities are encouraging repainting of the psychedelic buildings; boutique hotels can only be months away. J is for Jug ears. Prince Charles is one of many notable visitors to have made a pilgrimage to Mount Athos, a theocratic republic in north-east Greece that is home to 21 monasteries and one of the spiritual centres of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It's a Camilla-free zone though: women are banned. Charles has been known to stay at the not-so-pious five-star Eagle's Palace Hotel in nearby Halkidiki (0870 443 2972; www.amathusholidays.co.uk), where a week costs from \u00a31,700. K is for Kokosalaki - first name, Sophia. Though now based in the UK, she was born in Greece and studied at Athens University. The Greek influence is apparent in her use of crafts, such as embroidery and crochet, and she famously designed Bj\u00f6rk's 'ocean dress'. L is for Laskarina and Libra, two independent Greek specialists. Laskarina (01444 880380; www.laskarina.co.uk) won the Observer Travel Awards for eight years in a row. New for next year will be the small volcanic island Nisyros, off Kos, and Spetses, setting for John Fowles' s The Magus. Libra (0870 241 5184; www.libraholidays.co.uk) bought Helios airways in December and so has many extra routes. M is for Minotaur. Released later this year, this horror film directed by Jonathan English is based on the myth of the horned beast that lived in a labyrinth in Knossos, Crete. It is the latest in a line of historical Greek dramas, following Alexander and Troy. The director describes it as a 'prehistoric Alien '. Visit Knossos on a day-trip from Vamos. Greek Islands Club (020 8232 9780, www.greekislandsclub.com) has villas including Hammam House which sleeps four in style from \u00a3660pp per week with flights. N is for Nobu, the celeb-studded London restaurant where Boris Becker impregnated a waitress in a broom cupboard. It has now opened a branch on Mykonos inside the suitably glamorous Belvedere Hotel (00 30 22890 25122; www.belvederehotel.com). Don't say: 'I'll have the moussaka and chips.' Do say: 'What a clever fusion of South American and Asian cuisine.' O is for Oliver Stone, director of the recent film Alexander which flopped like a wet paper plate of soggy feta, despite a stellar line-up including Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie. Alexander was born in Pella, near Macedonia's capital, Thessaloniki. Nearby Vergina has a world-famous archaeology museum housing the royal tomb of Alexander's father, Philip, and a marble head of Alexander himself. P is for Pitt (B) &amp; P (Diddy) . Both have been spotted hanging out in Greek locations. Brad was rumoured to have taken model April Florio for a saucy break weeks after his split from Jennifer Aniston (who herself has Greek parents and spent childhood summers there). P Diddy has been flaunting his gold jewellery around the designer bars and hotels of Mykonos. Q is for Queer. Following the example of the ancients, Greece knows how to be gay. Lesbos is the home-from-home of British gay female pleasure-seekers while Mykonos has been a prime gay holiday spot for years. Pierros is one of the oldest gay bars on the island and Super Paradise beach has a nudist section. Gay Places For You (0845 226 0019; www.gayplaces4u.com) has week-long packages from \u00a3299, including Gatwick flights. R is for Rail. Not the most obvious way of exploring the islands, but Great Rail Journeys (01904 521900; www.greatrail.com) has a 15-day trip departing Waterloo on 24 September, taking in the Peloponnese and Athens, via Florence, Lake Geneva and a cruise of the Adriatic for \u00a31,690pp. S is for Seaplanes. Returning to the islands after 60 years, seaplanes were reintroduced at the end of last year by Air Sea Lines (00 30 21094 02880; www.airseaplanes.com), making it possible to island-hop in style. It didn't last long though. The powerful Greek ferry companies forced the government to revoke the company's licence. It's hoping to restart the service this summer. T is for Wine tasting. Forget bad memories of retsina hangovers, Greece's wines have improved vastly over the past five years. The small but experimental Hatzidakis Winery in Santorini is producing a great white, called, imaginatively, Santorini, made with the assyrtiko grape. Three-year-old Biblia Chora, a vineyard on the mainland, has a fine, dry ros\u00e9 made using syrah grapes. Both are available in the UK from Noel Young (01223 566744) for \u00a38.99. You can stay at Vedema, a hotel in 400-year-old Heliopoulos Vineyard on Santorini with Seasons in Style (0151 342 0505; www.seasonsinstyle.co.uk). Seven nights from \u00a31,135 pp including flights from Heathrow. U is for Unesco. Greece abounds in Unesco world-heritage sites. The ancient walled town of Faliraki (not to be confused with drunken-mayhem Faliraki - see F) is the biggest. There are a number of Byzantine world-heritage sites near Thessaloniki in the north. Stay at the ultra-chic Asterias Suites boutique hotel in Sani, Halkidiki, which is hoping to open a branch of Momo in the hotel next year. Planet Holidays (0870 066 0909; www.planet-holidays.net) has a week B&amp;B from \u00a3705pp, including flights. V is for Valentine, as in Shirley, who ran off into the sun with a rugged, sun-tanned taverna owner. Do the same in Agios Ioannis, the village where it was filmed, on Mykonos. Stay at the Parenthesis Villa Resort (020 8422 4885; www.fivestargreece.com), luxe villas for eight with infinity pool from \u00a35,560 a week. Barman not included. W is for Weddings, big fat ones. Increasing numbers of Brits are choosing to marry in Greece. Think music, dancing, plate-smashing... Weddings Santorini (00 30 22860 24057; www.weddingssantorini.com) has a variety of packages from around \u00a31,175 for a ceremony. X is for Xygia. Follow the smell of rotten eggs above this beautiful beach, north of Alykes bay on Zakynthos, to find the sulphur springs that flow into the sea. As spa experiences go, it's on the smelly side but at least it looks stunning. Stay at the vine-covered Nobelos Hotel (00 30 26950 27632; www.nobelos.gr), with rooms from \u00a3265 per night. Y is for Yachting. Greece is a nation of sailors and there are unlimited possibilities for finding deserted beaches and uninhabited islands. A flotilla holiday to the Saronic Gulf islands and the Peloponnese in May or June costs from \u00a3399pp per week with Seafarer Cruising &amp; Sailing (0870 442 2448; www.seafarercruises.com), including flights to Poros. Z is for Zorba the Greek, the hit film of 1964, featuring a swarthy Cretan who teaches an English writer how to live life Greek-style. It won seven Oscars and was based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. His grave is in the south wall of the city of Heraklion, Crete's capital. Take a day trip from the designer, hillside Elounda Gulf Villas, near Elounda. A villa that sleeps six costs from \u00a32,625 a week with Elegant Resorts (01244 897444; www.elegantresorts.co.uk)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
