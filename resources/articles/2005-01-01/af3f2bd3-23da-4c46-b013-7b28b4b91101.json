Elena Cosentino, who worked for CNN as a producer and reporter for six years before being dismissed in March last year, is due to appear today at the tribunal in Woburn Place in central London. Ms Cosentino is being represented by Bindman &amp; Partners, a law firm that specialises in employment, media and human rights cases. One of her key witnesses, who is flying in from Italy today, is her doctor, who is expected to comment on her condition following the loss of her fianc\u00e9 in a motorbike accident in July 2002. CNN is contesting the case. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
