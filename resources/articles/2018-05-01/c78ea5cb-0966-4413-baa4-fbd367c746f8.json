UK-based companies looking to increase trade with countries outside the EU are more likely to come into contact with corrupt markets, particularly in the developing world, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Brexit will also provide greater opportunities for criminals to launder money, such as investing dirty cash in British businesses that deal in high-value items such as gems and precious metals, the agency said. In its annual assessment of serious and organised crime, the NCA said criminals would take advantage of a redesigned customs setup when the UK leaves the EU, as well as any gaps in intelligence-sharing between countries, which could lead to international fugitives evading capture. \u201cAs the UK moves towards exiting the EU in March 2019, UK-based businesses may look to increase the amount of trade they have with non-EU countries,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe judge this will increase the likelihood that UK businesses will come into contact with corrupt markets, particularly in the developing world, raising the risk they will be drawn into corrupt practices.\u201d The NCA said the result of the EU referendum would be \u201ca key driver of uncertainty\u201d in the next five years. Nikki Holland, the director of investigations for the National Crime Agency, said: \u201cWe know the criminals will adapt to what the arrangements are and exploit any loopholes. We think while there is uncertainty \u2026 the criminals will be waiting to see what the opportunities and loopholes are, to get their goods across the border during any confusion.\u201d As well as the NCA, police forces, MI5, MI6, GCHQ, the Border Force, immigration enforcement and the Prison Service all contributed to the assessment. Law enforcement agencies, including the NCA, have previously warned of the risks to intelligence sharing posed by the vote to leave the EU. Lynne Owens, the NCA director general, has urged ministers to protect Britain\u2019s security arrangements with Europe, including use of the European arrest warrant and membership of Europol, amid concerns about the impact of leaving the EU. Membership of the EU gives the NCA and UK police forces access to tools that allow them to share intelligence quickly and efficiently with European counterparts. Before the referendum, former security chiefs, including the former head of MI5 Eliza Manningham-Buller and the former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers, had said that voting remain was in the best interests of the country\u2019s security. Elsewhere in the report, the NCA warned that the UK remained a prime destination for foreign corrupt and politically exposed people to launder money, with the biggest sources of corrupt investment being Russia, Nigeria and Pakistan. \u201cInvestment in UK property, particularly in London, continues to be an attractive mechanism to launder funds,\u201d the report said. The NCA said that the scale of money laundering in the UK annually is in the billions of pounds. The agency also flagged an increase in criminal gunfire on the streets of Britain. The report said the majority of weapons had not been previously used, which suggested an easy flow of illegal weapons into the UK. The warning comes as the UK, particularly London, struggles to curb rising violent crime involving guns and knives. The government last month launched a \u00a340m serious violence strategy that focuses heavily on the links between illegal drug markets, particularly for crack cocaine, and violent crime. It will be backed by a new offensive weapons bill to ban the sale of corrosive liquids to under-18s and introduce tougher restrictions on buying knives online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
