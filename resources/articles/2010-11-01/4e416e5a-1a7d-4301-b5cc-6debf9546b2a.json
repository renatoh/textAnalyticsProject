Education secretary Michael Gove's intention, it seems, is to replace the current offer of up to five weekly hours of PE and physical activity with \"an Olympic-style school sport competition\". In my opinion, this equates to a possible situation where only a tiny minority of the most gifted, talented and motivated children compete in a single quadrennial competition. I assume the rest will be encouraged to clap and cheer, or perhaps watch the event on television? In this age of austerity it may, very sadly, be truly necessary to cut funding for physical education in schools. To somehow use the upcoming 2012 Olympics as a reason to do this is, in my opinion, unforgivably cynical. We, as a nation, are in the middle of an obesity crisis, where only 5% of the population is active enough. This doesn't strike me as the optimal time to remove PE from the curriculum. Competitive sport should be encouraged in schools and clubs; it's a competitive world after all. To concentrate on competitive sport at the expense of mass participation will, however, only widen existing health inequalities. Many children are only exposed to sport through school PE. Few children will experience hockey, netball, lacrosse, rugby or trampolining without it. Those in favour of the suggestion to not make PE compulsory might want to look to our Scottish neighbours. In Scotland, as a whole, PE is not compulsory and they have some of the highest rates of obesity, heart disease and premature death in Europe. Surely this is food for thought in the whole school PE debate?
