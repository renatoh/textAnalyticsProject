This is Daniel Radcliffe, 16, stripped of his Harry Potter togs and drawn as a very ordinary teenager: frank, alert and curious. The drawing is part of a group of portraits of actors - including Michael Gambon, John Hurt and Rosamund Pike - by Stuart Pearson Wright, who won the BP Portrait award in 2001. They go on display at the National Theatre and the National Portrait Gallery in London from today; the gallery has just bought nine of the images, including the portrait of Radcliffe. He is the youngest sitter, apart from royalty, to make it into the gallery's permanent collection. Pearson Wright - who notoriously once painted Prince Philip naked from the waist up - said Radcliffe had been \"enthusiastic and helpful. He couldn't have been a more agreeable sitter. I dropped my rubber at one point and he practically threw himself across the room to pick it up for me.\" But, he said, he felt that this was \"not my best drawing\", and he had felt stumped by Radcliffe's very cheerfulness and youth. \"It was quite a challenge,\" said Pearson Wright. \"As people's faces get older they get blighted by cynicism and evidence of broken hearts and all the things that go wrong in life. When you draw someone so young, there is little evidence of any real trauma. \"It's not that Daniel lacked character, it was just that he had an extreme openness and lack of cynicism - and it was difficult to know what to do with that. I have a particular affinity with grizzly old men.\" Radcliffe - who said he had found the the experience of sitting for his portrait fascinating - came to Pearson Wright's studio for three sittings. \"We talked about bands he liked, what he wanted to do - and he was very interested in the process,\" said the artist. \"We are usually presented with actors as performers, and a portrait strips that out,\" he added. \"You simply cannot project something about yourself for six or seven hours. The images move beyond what's projected, and, I hope, reveal something that's usually hidden.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
