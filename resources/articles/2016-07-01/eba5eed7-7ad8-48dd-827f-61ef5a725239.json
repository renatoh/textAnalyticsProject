Hillary has me fired up!\u201d he said. Hillary Clinton has been tested. She has seen up close what\u2019s involved \u2026 she\u2019s seen the consequences of things working well and things not working well. And there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton. Ever. \u2013 Barack Obama An FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email as secretary of state concluded that \u201cno charges are appropriate\u201d, averting a potential campaign disaster. But FBI director James Comey criticized Clinton sharply. FBI recommends no charges In contradiction of past Clinton statements, Comey said the FBI had evidence that eight email chains joined by Clinton \u201ccontained information that was \u2018top secret at the time they were sent\u201d. Clinton: emails had no classified material Clinton and colleagues \u201cwere extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\u201d, Comey said. Additionally, he said Clinton had failed to turn over all her emails to the state department for review. Comey statement transcript We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account ... we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email account. \u2013 FBI director James Comey A Clinton spokesman said the campaign was \u201cpleased\u201d, adding: \u201cAs the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.\u201d House speaker Paul Ryan weighed in on a churning controversy that began Saturday when Donald Trump tweeted an image of Clinton and a six-pointed star that Trump said was a sheriff\u2019s star but that many recognized as a Star of David used in a derogatory manner. Look, antisemitic images \u2013 they\u2019ve got no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. The tweet has been deleted and I don\u2019t know how long he put this up there. Obviously they\u2019ve got to fix that \u2026 the point is I think he has to clean this up. \u2013 House speaker Paul Ryan"}, "isHosted": false}}}
