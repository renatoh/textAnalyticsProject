Took first international try well. Semesa Rokoduguni, wing, 7/10 Up against the enormous Nemani Nadolo but his quick feet and own power steadied the nerves of the Premiership\u2019s form wing. Could not stop the giant\u2019s try but made up for it with a second score. . Jonathan Joseph, centre, 7/10 Gave his side the perfect start with his early well-taken try and did well to anticipate a loose pass from Josh Matavesi for his second. Was strong in defence. Owen Farrell, centre, 6/10 Never much doubt that he would pass 500 international points. That took barely 10 minutes. Not one of his best displays by his very high standards but a decent game. Elliot Daly, wing, 7/10 The Wasps centre looked at home on the wing, his mazy run leaving the Fiji defence in splinters and was an ever present danger to the islanders after the break. George Ford, fly-half, 8/10 His well-flighted delayed pass gave Daly his try and he showed a wonderful range of passing in the second half. Nadolo gave him problems to solve in defence but another polished performance. Ben Youngs, scrum-half, 6/10 The Leicester playmaker was efficient but rarely got the chance to show the skills that so bamboozled the Springboks. Still outplayed his opposite number, the raw Seru Vularika. Mako Vunipola, prop, 6/10 The Saracen\u2019s last act was a lovely pass to give his club-mate Goode his try. The loose-head made some typically bullocking runs and was solid in the scrum. Dylan Hartley, hooker, 6/10 England\u2019s captain found his targets in the lineout and was unlucky to see his try ruled out after the break. Still looking for his best form after a long lay-off. Dan Cole, prop, 6/10 Cole had a less than happy afternoon against the Springboks but his discipline did not let him down this time and was a solid anchor in the scrum. Joe Launchbury, lock, 7/10 England\u2019s man-of-the-match against the Springboks and another commanding performance. Worked hard and England are lucky to have two stand-in locks like this. Courtney Lawes, lock, 6/10 The Northampton man gave a hard-working performance and made some important tackles before being replaced by Charlie Ewels. A decent, unspectacular showing. Chris Robshaw, flanker, 7/10 The former captain never lets England down and, as usual, he left nothing on the field with another 80-minute display. Another splendid contribution. Teimana Harrison, flanker, 6/10 Memories of that unhappy half an hour in the Sydney Test last summer were erased by a try from a rolling maul. In the side only because of an illness but will not have minded being substituted this time. Billy Vunipola, No8, 7/10 If there were doubts about Big Billy\u2019s fitness, they didn\u2019t show here. The No8 got stronger as the game went on and looks indestructible at the moment. Excellent again. Replacements Nathan Hughes 6 (Harrison 47) Some good carries and made instant impression; Jamie George 6 (Hartley 50) Big tackle to turn over possession near end; Joe Marler 5 (Mako Vunipola 50) Solid in the scrum; Danny Care 6 (Youngs 53) Kicked intelligently and enjoyed free rein; Ben Te\u2019o 7 (Farrell 53) Looked sharp in attack and made two big tackles; Charlie Ewels 6 (Lawes 58) Made some good runs; Henry Slade 6 (Joseph 66) Looked intelligent in attack and made good impression.
