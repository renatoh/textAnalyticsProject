Mourinho, reiterating he had no intention of falling out with Pep Guardiola now they are rival managers in Manchester, said he had identified \u201ca nucleus of four priorities\u201d when he replaced Louis van Gaal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s transfer from Borussia Dortmund is close to being finalised, following the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Ivory Coast international defender Eric Bailly, and United would like Pogba to play in the midfield role Rooney occupied towards the end of last season. Rooney has already had a detailed conversation with Mourinho and will now revert to playing in attack, with the manager making it clear he does not agree with Van Gaal or Roy Hodgson that a player who will be 31 in October should play as a midfielder. \u201cIn football there are many jobs but the one that is more difficult to find is the guy who puts the ball in the net,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt is normal that a player at his age changes a bit but there is something that will never change, which is the natural appetite to put the ball in the net. \u201cMaybe he is not a striker any more. Maybe he is not a No9 any more but, with me, he will never be a No6. He will never be somebody playing 50 metres from the goal. You can tell me his passing is amazing. Yes, his passing is amazing but my passing is also amazing without pressure. There are many players with a great pass but to be there and put the ball in the net is the most difficult thing to find. So, for me, he will be a nine or a 10 \u2013 a nine and a half maybe \u2013 but not a six and not even an eight.\u201d As Woodward met Mino Raiola, agent to Pogba and Mkhitaryan \u2013 primarily to finalise the Armenian\u2019s salary \u2013 in Monaco, Mourinho also made it clear he would not emulate Van Gaal\u2019s habit of targeting players who could operate in different roles. \u201cI like specialists \u2013 and not so much the multifunctional players \u2013 because I am very clear in my approach. We decided on four targets. From those four, we have three and we are still working hard. When we have the fourth, I breathe. We are not going to get the fourth on 31 August, no way. We are going to get the fourth before then.\u201d Mourinho explained why Ryan Giggs had left the club rather than accepting a role among his coaching staff. \u201cIt is not my responsibility that Ryan is not in the club. The job Ryan wanted is the job the club decided to give me. It is not my fault. Ryan wanted to be Manchester United manager and the club \u2013 for reasons only the club can tell you \u2013 decided the job was for me.\u201d Mourinho also emphasised that Marcus Rashford would play a considerable part, meaning Rooney is likely to take the No10 role. \u201cHe [Ibrahimovic] is 34 and Marcus Rashford is 18, so, divided by two, our two strikers are in the perfect age. Eighteen is not the perfect age and neither is 34, so I think they can be an amazing complement for each other.\u201d However, Mourinho\u2019s attempt to argue it was \u201calways a lie\u201d that he was reluctant to promote youth team players backfired on him when the list he had put together to argue his case turned out to include many who had made their debuts elsewhere \u2013 and one who had never even played for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
