Like other eastern European countries, it is geographically diverse for its smallish size, with mountains rising to almost 3,000 metres above sea level, low-lying plains and a coastline running along the Black Sea. The coast has a typically continental climate, with warm, sunny summers \u2013 temperatures (in Celsius) reaching the high 30s, and cold winters, with averages around freezing point and lows down to the minus 20s. Holiday resorts on the Black Sea are usually sunny and warm, but regular thunderstorms do occur throughout the summer months. Further south, towards the border with Greece, the climate is more Mediterranean in character, with warmer summers, but still fairly cold winters. On average there is more rain in summer than winter, with an average of 700mm across the country as a whole. Bulgaria\u2019s capital, Sofia, in the far west of the country, is 550 metres above sea level. Again, summers here are warm and humid, with plenty of sunshine, while winters are fairly cold, with snow lying on surrounding mountains, where there is a thriving ski industry. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020. Text was added to clarify that a reference to Bulgaria\u2019s borders was in relation to climate zones, not political boundaries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
