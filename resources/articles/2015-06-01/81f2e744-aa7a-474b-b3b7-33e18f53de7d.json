Speaking to ITV News soon after being released by police, Hakim Rezgui said his son had been spending time with new friends, but that he had no idea who was responsible for having warped his mind. Seifeddine Rezgui, a 23-year-old student at Kairouan university, attacked tourists on the beach in the coastal city of Sousse. At least 30 Britons are understood to have died in the shooting. Hakim Rezgui said that when he first heard the news he could not comprehend it and that he was sorry for all the lives that had been lost. \u201cMy god, I am so shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who has contacted him, influenced him or who has put these ideas in his head. He has new friends who got him into this.\u201d He added: \u201cMy son had no problem with anyone. But I don\u2019t know who has changed his mind, influenced him and who has warped his mind. I wish there had been no victims, no one hurt. I wish it had never happened. Because when I see the victims I think it could have been my own family. \u201cI had no idea and I am really sorry. I am upset to see those victims. I feel the loss of the families so strongly. I feel like I have died along with the victims. I am so ashamed for me, for his mother, for all our family.\u201d Describing the attack as a catastrophe, Rezgui explained that he rarely saw his son, who spent all his time at university or at a coffee shop. Adding that he had no idea of the plans Seifeddine was making, Rezgui said: \u201cMy son lost his life and he has lost our lives too. He has lost his life, his studies, his future and he\u2019s ended our lives too.\u201d The gunman\u2019s aunt, Zara Rezgui, said he was a \u201ckind, calm, normal boy\u201d who spent most of the time alone. She said: \u201cHe was a blank page, he didn\u2019t tell us anything about what he was planning. The first time we knew about it was when we saw it on the news. \u201cWe are shocked. God bless him. God is punishing us. His mother and father brought him up to be a good boy, work hard and get a good job. He never spoke about his secret.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian on Saturday, neighbours of the family in the Hay Zuhour neighbourhood of the small town of Ga\u00e2four in north Tunisia, said they were still coming to terms with the news. Monia Riahi, a neighbour and friend of the family, described Rezgui as good. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since he was small. He was never in trouble with anyone ever. Maybe he was brainwashed or something.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
