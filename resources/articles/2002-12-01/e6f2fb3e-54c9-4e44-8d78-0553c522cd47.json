Moved on the eve of this match to deny rumours of malpractice in his transfer dealings, the Fulham coach saw his team knocked out after dominating their German opponents. Despite playing 14 European matches, Fulham have failed to reach the fourth round. A journey which began five months ago in the Intertoto Cup ended last night because Fulham failed to take three good first-half chances and lacked the ingenuity after the interval to break down a Hertha Berlin team who defended bravely in the face of almost incessant pressure. The quality of Fulham's final ball was lacking in the second 45 minutes and throughout they were frustrated by Hertha's impressive goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly. The Hungarian played almost 20 minutes at the end with an injury after being clattered by Steve Marlet but epitomised his side's spirit by holding firm. Fulham would have done well to put the limping Kiraly under greater pressure but only once seriously stretched him. Tigana was left to rue the own-goal by Facundo Sava in Berlin which enabled Hertha to take a 2-1 lead into this second leg. Yet he will know that his team should have turned the tie around in the first half, when Luis Boa Morte wasted two good opportunities and Marlet had an effort saved. Fulham were superior to an average Hertha side whose inability to hold possession meant they were repeatedly under the cosh. Although Tigana's team ought to have been beaten in the closing minutes when Michael Hartmann missed two glaring chances, that would have been harsh. \"I'm very disappointed because I think we deserved to win,\" Tigana said. \"We had many chances during the first half and were a bit unlucky. That's experience. At this level when you have a chance you have to score.\" Fulham were most effective in the first half when the pace of Boa Morte and Marlet, coupled with Marlet's strength in the air, caused Hertha problems. Sean Davis also did well despite an illness which eventually forced him off just after the hour and leaves him doubtful for the game at home to Birmingham on Sunday. After Alain Goma hit the bar early on, Boa Morte ought to have scored when set up by Marlet, who said afterwards that he was \"surprised\" by the furore over alleged irregularities with his \u00a311.5m move from Lyon. He added he had waived a \u00a32m payment from his former club to facilitate the transfer. \"I gave up the fee that I was entitled to according to my contract with Lyon,\" he said. \"I knew if I didn't I would not have come to Fulham. None of the news surrounding my transfer has affected my game and this had nothing to do with me personally. I have not had to get involved. I have been with my agents for two or three years and this is the first transfer they have handled for me.\" Fulham's second half was full of effort but few clear chances. Hertha defended in numbers and Fulham could not find a way through a back line well marshalled by the Germany international Marko Rehmer. Steed Malbranque, so often an inspiration, was quiet. \"We have to try to come back into Europe,\" Tigana said. His players may be less than delighted to know that he will take the Intertoto route again if necessary.
