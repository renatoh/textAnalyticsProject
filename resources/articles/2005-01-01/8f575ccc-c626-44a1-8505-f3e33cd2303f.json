There's a rich, smug mortgage broker who reads all the business how-to books and holds office bonding sessions, an old-school removal firm boss who likes to run the business as if it's an army regiment, and a creative consultancy that is so wacky you expect Timmy Mallet to be on the reception desk. The top tip from the self-made millionaire - go see a clairvoyant - is probably something they don't teach on the MBA. Not sure what we're meant to get from this, apart from realising that the boss you've got probably isn't so bad after all. Martin Skegg Films One Million Years BC (Don Chaffey, 1966) 6pm, FilmFour Hammer's biggest hit has cavewoman Raquel Welch in the legendary fur bikini, grunting and being chased by dinosaurs that are almost as badly behaved as the cavemen - there's a war going on between the Rock People and the Shell People. Never mind that Chaffey and co got their prehistory in a muddle; Ray Harryhausen's special effects are terrific, even if they don't quite walk with the Jurassic Park creations. Angela's Ashes (Alan Parker, 1999) 8pm, FilmFour Limerick, 1935. It rains all the time. Young Frank's siblings drop like flies amid scenes of appalling squalor. This is by no means fun. But there is much to appreciate in Parker's committed and sensitive screen adaptation of Frank McCourt's gruelling, Pulitzer prize-winning autobiography: Robert Carlyle as the dad sinking into the bottle; Emily Watson the mother who gives her all for her ailing children; the fine work of the trio who play Frank (Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael Legge) and a rough-and-ready sense of (gallows) humour. Dirty Pretty Things (Stephen Frears, 2002) 8pm, Sky Movies 1 A sympathetic and sensitive depiction of what life is like for illegal immigrants scratching a living in a downbeat, backstreet London. Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly charismatic as the Nigerian Okwe, slogging away as as a taxi driver and hotel night porter; Audrey \"Am\u00e9lie\" Tautou is a Turkish asylum-seeker working as a cleaner. The thriller element is slightly overplayed as the pair are drawn into an organ-donor racket, but it's resolved very satisfyingly; and Chris Menges's harsh, atmospheric photography perfectly captures the seedy side of the capital. Narc (Joe Carnahan, 2002) 12midnight, Sky Movies 2 By-the-book cop thriller with Jason Patric as Tellis, a detective suspended after accidentally shooting a pregnant woman in a breathless opening sequence. After that his only way back is to investigate the murder of a colleague, the partner of Ray Liotta's Lt Henry Oak (recalling his nasty cop in Unlawful Entry). It's all very cliched, but Carnahan's attention to detail and fascination with down-and-dirty police undercover/surveillance work creates a relentless, compelling thriller.
