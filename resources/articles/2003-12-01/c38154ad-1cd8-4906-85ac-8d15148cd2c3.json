Great. Pavel Nedved has just pipped Thierry Henry to the title of European footballer of the year. Super. Who cares about these emptily prestigious awards anyway? Let's think of a category in which not even the most blatant anti-Premiership bias could deny this country a gong. Were there a prize for the 2003 world manager of the year it would have to go to Sir Alex Ferguson. At least it would if the judges had any news sense. Ferguson might not have masterminded another European cup triumph this year. His far from inconsiderable feat of reeling in Arsenal when they looked a shoo-in for the title pales in comparison with the treble haul of four years ago. But when it comes to generating controversy, filling newspapers and generally making life more interesting, the Manchester United manager is in a league of his own. And what a year he has just had. In time, 2003 may come to be remembered as vintage Ferguson. If it is remembered for anything else, it will be misbehaving footballers, financial meltdown and a high proportion of dull games. Quite simply, we are lucky to have had Ferguson around to brighten things up. Who else would have precipitated the departure of his star player by kicking a boot at him, simultaneously giving Arsenal and their fans a chuckle by revealing the extent of his annoyance at the FA Cup defeat? Who else would get into trouble with Uefa by accusing them of fixing their Champions League draws? Ferguson also suggested Arsenal and the FA had been doing deals for years, and was dubbed a hooligan by the Spanish press after warning his players to look out for dirty tricks from Real Madrid. Back in February, Fergie caused a storm by casually revealing Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson had shaken hands on a deal to take over at Old Trafford, and he put the FA under more pressure in October when his alleged advice to England players threatening to strike in support of Rio Ferdinand was, 'Make 'em sweat.' The new season had barely begun when, at Newcastle, Ferguson became the first Premiership manager to be sent off, obligingly giving picture desks a treat by booting the ball away in disgust. A couple of months later he provoked groans around the country by revealing he would be saying at United until the age of 65 at least. All this, and another contribution to the language with 'squeaky bum time' joining 'hairdryer treatment' in football's lexicon. Never mind a knighthood, Ferguson deserves a Queen's Award for Industry for all that. Yet, despite his phenomenal workrate, he is far from universally popular outside Manchester. Except with the press, who know a good thing when they see one and will miss Ferguson dreadfully when his retirement date finally arrives. We will not be alone in that. Just about everyone in the country has an opinion on Ferguson. The fact that many of them are uncomplimentary does not really matter. Ferguson provokes a response, often a strong response, in people who have no interest in football. Love him or hate him, it is impossible to ignore him. Kevin Keegan would have been better ignoring him instead of getting so famously worked up in 1996, but he could not manage it. Football fans around the country feel the same way. In the North-East or the Midlands, they would not really care one way or the other if Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left Arsenal or Terry Venables went back to Spurs, but they watch every development at Manchester United like hawks. It is easy to be impressed by Wenger's urbanity, Claudio Ranieri's humility and Gerard Houllier's honesty. Steve McLaren is thoughtful and thorough, Graeme Souness still bristles with combative pride, David Moyes is driven and determined and Martin O'Neill, when he eventually turns up somewhere, will be full of nervous energy. All these are admirable qualities, but when Manchester United have an ordinary manager again who will provide the stories? Who will make us laugh? Who is going to provoke all the arguments? Ferguson has been fulfilling all these functions in addition to being the most successful manager in the country. He is not only the last of the old, transforming type of manager, the sort who built empires on unpromising foundations, but he displays the mixture of evangelism and hucksterism detectable in all the great managers from Herbert Chapman through Bill Shankly to Brian Clough. It is as if he feels responsible for selling the club as well as running it. To a large extent, he and the club share a single identity. 'Sir Alex Ferguson is Manchester United,' chief executive David Gill said this year. This is no smoke and mirrors trick either. Ferguson has accomplished everything in the full glare of the modern media in the age of the all-powerful plc. No one else has done more to sell the Premiership, and no-one is really looking forward to a Premiership without him. That is why his decision to stay on was so warmly welcomed. Football needs managers who are both old-fashioned and bang up to date. That is not the only contradiction at the heart of his appeal. One journalist who had better remain nameless summed it up most succinctly when he said he could never make up his mind whether Ferguson was the greatest character in the world or its biggest bastard. He did not say bastard, of course, he used a much ruder word than that. What makes Ferguson unique is that it seems possible to hold both these opinions at the same time. It is not simply an either/or option of loving or hating him. Those who are impressed by him can see why some are not, and even those who dislike him cannot help but admire his tenacity, his principles and his willingness to court unpopularity. One suspects that even Piers Morgan, Daily Mirror editor, Arsenal fan and the most rabid anti-Ferguson voice within the media, secretly respects the old fire-breather. He would never admit it, although even at the most basic level he would have to allow that Fergie has been good for newspaper sales. True, Ferguson occasionally terrorises journalists, and his bullying of younger and more inexperienced reporters is one of his less attractive traits, although the co-operation and the copy that flow the other way more than makes up for these lapses. Ferguson understands the media in a way that few managers do, and journalists will forgive almost anything for a story. Were Ferguson a reluctant talker, a dull interviewee or a suspicious hoarder of club secrets he would be thoroughly unpopular among football correspondents. In fact just the opposite is the case. Ferguson has been such good value over the years that even those reporters he has crossed - that is, practically everyone - still hold him in the highest regard. Few know him better than Peter Fitton, who covers the Manchester beat for the Mail on Sunday after spending more than a decade speaking to Ferguson on a daily basis for The Sun. 'We've had our run-ins and slanging matches, and some of them were humdingers, but at the end of the day you are welcomed back and he gives you full co-operation again,' he explains. 'He does not bear personal grudges, that's the main thing.' Brian Kidd would be surprised to hear that, as would Gordon Strachan, Mark Palios and a few others at the FA, but Ferguson has been consistent over the years in rebuilding his media bridges. 'He understands we have a job to do and we cannot always get along like friends, but invariably Alex will be sympathetic to media requests,' Fitton says. 'He'll help you out if he can. For all his grumpiness he's actually just what the media need in a manager. He's available and outspoken. He will not be easy to replace in that sense. The manager of Manchester United will always be newsworthy, but I think there will be a sense of a vacuum to fill when this one steps down. You won't quite see gaps on back pages but the loss will be felt. Football will feel a loss too. Some call Fergie a dinosaur, and it is true he's the last of a breed. He belongs with Busby, Shankly and Stein. There aren't any more like that around.' Before this piece becomes too hagiographic and we start to receive irate letters from Manchester City fans, it should be recorded that Ferguson is not perfect. His habit of refusing to speak to reporters after games is one that Joe Lovejoy, football correspondent of The Sunday Times , finds hard to forgive. 'I would say without doubt that Ferguson is the best manager in the game, but he is also the worst communicator,' Lovejoy says. 'The worst post-match communicator anyway, I accept he is helpful in most other circumstances. People have said to me that Brian Clough was the same, but two wrongs don't make a right, and surely we've all moved on a bit since Cloughie was in his pomp.' Fair point. In his defence, Ferguson began to feel the press had begun to gang up on him on match days. When United had lost, or something controversial had taken place on the pitch, his post-match comments would fill newspapers for the next few days because reporters knew he would never say anything disloyal to his players and could be guaranteed to prolong the debate. He did exactly that over the Ferdinand case last week. He talked about it. Many managers would have been tempted to hide behind no comments or plc-prepared statements, but not this one. Ferguson can hardly be described as anti-media, except perhaps by himself. To hear him talk you would think he would not mind if he never had to speak to reporters again, but the relationship is not entirely one-sided. Ferguson enjoys manipulating the media too much not to miss it, even if he does find himself doing far more than he would ever have imagined 20 years ago. Paddy Barclay of The Sunday Telegraph is a fellow Scot who remembers Ferguson coming down from Aberdeen. 'The ultimate test of management is whether you can do it at more than one club, so I would put Ferguson up there with Herbert Chapman and Brian Clough. There will be a void when he's gone.' Indeed there will. Here is a festive tale to prove it. Around a dozen Christmas Eves ago, Ferguson was upset with the Manchester Evening News . Their veteran reporter turned up at The Cliff, the old training ground, to discover he was banned. Ferguson was personally vetting journalists at the gate, allowing the favoured few in, and making sure the MEN 's man remained outside. The reporter appealed to Ferguson's better nature, but still found the door slammed in his face. Then, as he turned to trudge back to his car, he heard the door open again and Ferguson call him back. 'Am I allowed in again?' he asked? 'No,' Ferguson said. 'But Happy Christmas.' Priceless.
