They rejected complaints that a poster advert by an insurance company was not backed by evidence proving women were better behind the wheel. The Admiral Insurance Services Diamond Car Insurance poster, picturing a man in a hairdressing salon having his hair coloured, stated: \"Some men will try anything to get cheaper car insurance! Diamond only do car insurance for women because women are better drivers.\" Defending its advert, Cardiff-based Admiral provided statistics, which it said showed women are better drivers because men make more and larger insurance claims. And it provided 108 sample quotes from 12 competitors' websites which, it said, supported the figures through lower insurance premiums for women. The ASA stated: \"In the context of the advertisement, readers were likely to interpret the claim to mean that women had fewer accidents and made fewer claims. \"The advertisers had substantiated the interpretation of the claim which was acceptable.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
