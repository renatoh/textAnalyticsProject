Four catches went down as Jason Holder\u2019s side tightened their grip on the second Test and indeed a series they lead 1-0 with Broad seeing two off his own bowling to move to 97 drops over the course of his 125-cap England career. But despite staring at an 85-run first innings deficit with four more wickets still to claim in the morning \u2013 not least the watchful Darren Bravo, unbeaten on 33 from 165 balls, Broad still fancies that a famous turnaround is possible. \u201cI feel a bit lost as to how we got only six wickets to be brutally honest,\u201d said Broad, who will resume in the morning with figures of three for 42 from 28 overs. \u201cWe\u2019ve put everything into it. Heart and soul has gone into that day. 103 plays and misses in the day? I can\u2019t think of any more in any Test that I\u2019ve played in. \u201cWest Indies have shown a lot of grit and they\u2019ve left the ball better than us. But is that the way we\u2019ll get back into this Test? Probably not. We\u2019re going to have to move the game on. \u201cIt will either be 2-0 or 1-1 \u2013 I can\u2019t see this being a draw \u2013 but if we got 140 on the board I would fancy our chances. Scoreboard pressure counts for a lot.\u201d On the missed chances, for which Jos Buttler was twice the guilty party at third slip including Bravo on 20, Broad said: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere we have got to improve. It\u2019s been a running theme for a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of training but to become the best team in the world you have to take your chances.\u201d Broad was frustrated to be left out of the first Test in Barbados, an error only highlighted by his threat here in Antigua. Asked if he felt he had a point to prove, the 32-year-old replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Everyone in the set-up knows how nicely I\u2019ve been bowling in the nets. \u201cI got three wickets today but in all honesty I could have walked away with a hatful. I don\u2019t mean that to sound arrogant but I felt that threatening as a bowler.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
