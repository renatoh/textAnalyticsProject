Oleg Shcherbinsky was convicted for causing death by negligent driving after his car hit that of Mikhail Yevdokimov, a former comedian turned governor of the Altai region, causing it to pile into a roadside tree. Mr Shcherbinsky's defence team claimed the governor's car was travelling at 125mph when it hit their client's car."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
