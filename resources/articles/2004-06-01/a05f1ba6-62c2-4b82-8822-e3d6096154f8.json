He was confidently ridden by Tony Culhane, who produced the 9-4 favourite to lead inside the final furlong and draw away to beat Digital by five lengths. Polar Bear, who is owned by the trainer William Haggas's father Brian, was well beaten on fast ground in the Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot last week, but Haggas said: \"We got lucky with the ground here, it suited him. He is not a bad horse when things are right and I bought him for 20,000gns off Cheveley Park Stud.\" Richard Fahey was on his way to Leicester's evening meeting and missed seeing Shamrock Tea (6-1) show the way home under apprentice Tony Hamilton in the TSG Brice Associates Handicap. Shamrock Tea, a winner in soft ground at Ripon last year, struck the the front with a quarter of a mile to race and, with his rider had work, he ran on gamely to beat Musiotal, who did not enjoy the best of luck in running.
