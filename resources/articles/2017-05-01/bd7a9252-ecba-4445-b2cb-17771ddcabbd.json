His death, which came peacefully in his sleep, was unexpected \u2013 but then all deaths, even those we\u2019re anticipating, arrive as a surprise, if only because of their shocking irrevocability. \u201cNo, no, no life?\u201d cries Lear, \u201cWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life/ And thou no breath at all? Thou\u2019lt come no more/ Never, never, never, never, never.\u201d My family arranged a secular service for my father: one that, I hope, did some justice to the memory of a loving and kind man. But throughout the whole awful process I found myself wondering at the scantiness of the cultural resources available at such a basic human moment. Think, for instance, of the eulogy that forms the centrepiece of the traditional funeral. By custom, it follows a tripartite structure: first, you celebrate the dead person\u2019s virtues; second, you lament their loss; third, you affirm your hope in their eternal life. All the elements feel, today, oddly out of joint. Most obviously, heaven \u2013 at least as once understood \u2013 no longer really exists, now that a kind of weak atheism prevails as the unspoken theological default. Even among the pious, the afterlife has faded and blurred, with the major faiths restructured along secular lines and experienced by most people as a cultural affiliation rather than an engagement with something fundamentally Other. Compare Philippe Ari\u00e8s\u2019 classic description of death during the Middle Ages in Europe, a process, he says, governed by intricate rituals that implicated the whole community. Ideally, the ailing person acknowledged the imminence of their passing, and then began farewelling family, friends and even enemies, settling old grievances and granting pardons in an elaborate ceremony of mutual forgiveness. A deathbed meant communal prayers but also eating, drinking, music and games. Nothing separated religion from daily routine; the porous boundaries between the ordinary and the miraculous enabled faith to shape how men and women laboured, how they loved and how they celebrated \u2013 and then guide them through their encounter with death. The historian Brandy Schillace notes that, bizarre as it seems to us, \u201cmost people hoped to be spared a quick death, as it prevented them from preparing for the end financially, socially and spiritually.\u201d It\u2019s not possible \u2013 and nor is it desirable \u2013 to return to a premodern era (in which, we should note, the life expectancy stood at about 30). Nevertheless, we can acknowledge that the victories won by science over superstition and disease involve a certain collateral damage, which becomes particularly apparent at the death of a loved one. Whether we\u2019re atheists or whether we\u2019re believers, we trust now in doctors and hospitals rather than priests and rituals, with eternity, even for the faithful, a concept banished to the specific field known as \u201creligion\u201d, a ground marked off as fundamentally distinct from daily life. \u201cFor many men,\u201d says John Updike, \u201cwork is the effective religion, a ritual occupation and inflexible orientation which permits them to imagine that the problem of their personal death has been solved\u201d \u2013 and one suspects that\u2019s true even for churchgoers. The corrosion, not merely of belief, but of the collective ceremonies that belief once animated deprives us of the vocabulary with which, in the second part of the traditional eulogy, we\u2019re invited to express our sorrow. How often, today, do we rehearse the cadence and rhetoric of public emotion? Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 people arrive at the most significant events of their lives (weddings as well as funerals) with no experience of ceremonial oratory, and, not surprisingly, find themselves, in a moment they want with all their heart to be special, scrabbling through dead phrases and snatches of poems half-remembered from movies and TV. Like Flaubert, we long for music that will melt the stars but instead make do with the cracked kettle of clich\u00e9 and hand-me-down sentiment, so that our joy and our grief sounds, even to ourselves, oddly distant and insincere. That difficulty pertains also to the first aspect of the eulogy: the celebration of virtue. For what, today, does virtue mean? What values do we collectively honour, when the governing philosophy begins and ends with \u201cbuy low and sell high\u201d? In the past, we took our concept of the good life from religion \u2013 or, perhaps, from the social movements that created a secular morality and thus gave their members the purpose and meaning that a dying God could no longer provide (think of Henry Lawson\u2019s short story \u201cThe Union Buries Its Dead\u201d). But, like the churches, the great causes of the 20th century exist only as faint shadows of themselves, stripped of the emotional power they once possessed. One doesn\u2019t have to be a radical to acknowledge \u2013 in this, the year of Donald Trump \u2013 the spiritual impoverishment of late capitalism. Back in 1970, the pioneer neoconservative Irving Kristol noted the market\u2019s tendency to corrode all social virtues \u2013 a tendency that, over the past half century, has become infinitely more pronounced. In 2017, everyone understands that, if you want to succeed in public life, an overly developed conscience counts as a liability rather than an asset (hence the almost universal contempt in which politicians are held throughout the industrialised world). Obviously, we all know good people \u2013 I am confident my father was one \u2013 but we recognise them despite, and not because of, the social order in which we live. As a result, it\u2019s strangely difficult to celebrate their goodness, other than by cataloging a string of prosaic qualities, rather as one might complete the profile for an online dating service. Of course, the deceased do not care what we say about them or, indeed, how we mark their passing. But that doesn\u2019t make our rituals less important. \u201c[T]he awareness of death,\u201d writes Robert Pogue Harrison in his Dominion of the Dead, \u201cthat defines human nature is inseparable from \u2013 indeed it arises from \u2013 our awareness that we are not self-authored, that we follow in the footsteps of the dead.\u201d My father is gone, and no one can bring him back. But, precisely because we\u2019re not self authored, our relationship with the dead reflects the relationships between the living: the way we order and govern our society. And that, at least, we can change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
