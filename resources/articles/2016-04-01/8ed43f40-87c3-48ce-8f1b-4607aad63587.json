The Holland right-back was withdrawn with a groin injury in the 40th minute of Newcastle\u2019s 3-1 defeat on the south coast and took his frustrations out on the wall as angry words were exchanged between Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s players at the interval. Newcastle declined to comment on the extraordinary incident but it is understood that Janmaat subsequently admitted he had been \u201cstupid\u201d. He is now undergoing treatment for both injuries. While the broken fingers will not rule him out of contention for Saturday\u2019s now vital home game against Swansea City, the groin problem may yet sideline him for a match Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side must win in order to have any realistic chance of avoiding relegation. Newcastle are 19th, six points adrift of fourth bottom Norwich City and two in arrears of 18th placed Sunderland but, like their Wearside neighbours \u2013 who visit Carrow Road on Saturday \u2013 have a game in hand on Alex Neil\u2019s side. Jamaal Lascelles, the former Nottingham Forest centre-half, is believed to have been particularly vocal in the dressing room at Southampton and he proved forthright in a subsequent BBC interview. \u201cWe need bigger characters on the pitch, players who care and who are going to get after each other,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cWe have lacked it this season and no matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t have that fight and hunger and desire, it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cWe had Steve McClaren who is a great manager and now we\u2019ve got Rafa Ben\u00edtez, who is a great manager, so it\u2019s clearly not that. It\u2019s the players and we have to take full responsibility. It\u2019s ourselves who need to change it and not the manager. \u201cWe need to play with more heart. We\u2019ve got flair players, tricky players, players with loads of talent, but we need more heart, we need more desire.\u201d Ben\u00edtez has struggled with a lengthy injury list but, despite Janmaat\u2019s groin problem, things seem to be improving slightly in that department. Indeed, Fabricio Coloccini and Paul Dummett are expected to return to centre-half and left-back respectively at St James\u2019 Park on Saturday following long-standing calf and hamstring injuries while Jack Colback has completed a two-match suspension. Should Janmaat not be fit enough to start, Kevin Mbabu, newly recovered from a long-term thigh injury, could be deployed at right-back against Swansea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
