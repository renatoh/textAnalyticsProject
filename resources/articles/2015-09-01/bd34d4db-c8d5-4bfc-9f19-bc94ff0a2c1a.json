Liverpool head to Old Trafford on Saturday without the suspended Philippe Coutinho and seeking to atone for a 3-0 defeat at home to West Ham United before the international break. That woeful display invited familiar criticism of Liverpool under Rodgers and the manager has issued a defence reminiscent of last season, after the club also embarked on a major summer overhaul of his squad. Namely, that it is too early in the season to judge Liverpool and new players require time to adapt to life at Anfield. Rodgers said: \u201cIt was from December through [when Liverpool hit form last season]. We are still only in early September. In the season when we nearly won the league we didn\u2019t really play that brand of football until November or December time. So we need to give this group a bit of time. That\u2019s something ill-afforded to you in modern football but I get great excitement when I see the players and see the likes of Daniel Sturridge coming back in. I think this team will show its worth over the course of the season, not just in these early games.\u201d Harry Redknapp described Rodgers\u2019 side as \u201cbang average\u201d after his former club West Ham won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years and insisted it was the worst Liverpool team in years. The Liverpool manager countered: \u201cI think it\u2019s a team that has changed and will progress over the course of the season. People will always form opinions and Harry is someone I have huge respect for but I will always focus on the players I work with and look to make them better. I know this group of players will improve as the season moves on.\u201d Liverpool suffered that heavy defeat at Old Trafford last season, albeit in a game when United goalkeeper David De Gea was named man of the match, with Rodgers having altered his tactics and personnel in an attempt to halt an alarming run of form. His team then embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run in the league to rise into contention for a top-four finish before United broke that momentum with a 2-1 win at Anfield in March. \u201cIt was probably the best defeat I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Rodgers of the 3-0 defeat at United. \u201cOf course you never want to lose a game and especially not to a rival like Manchester United. But I saw enough that day to know that we had got our identity back again. We created a lot of chances and should have scored goals but we ultimately lost the game because we didn\u2019t defend well enough. From that moment we kicked on and had a very good spell.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no question, absolutely no question [Liverpool can kick on again]. The talent is there and the focus is there. It\u2019s a game the players are really looking forward to.\u201d Sturridge is not in contention for a recall against United despite resuming full training on Thursday following a four-month lay-off, while the captain, Jordan Henderson, and his fellow midfielder Adam Lallana face late fitness tests on respective foot and thigh injuries. \u201cThere is no timeline as to when he will be fit to participate in a game,\u201d said Rodgers on Sturridge. \u201cHe looked really sharp in training, probably the best he\u2019s looked fitness-wise for 18 months, and it will be really good when he gets back.\u201d Danny Ings, however, is pressing for his first Liverpool start since arriving from Burnley in the summer having impressed as a late substitute against West Ham. The manager admitted: \u201cI would have no qualms about putting Danny in. He scored there last season and he\u2019s been a real bright spark since he came in. It is going to take time for him to adapt to the club but I would have no qualms if I wanted to play him there because he\u2019s a threat to the goal, he works hard, presses well and has that quality in front of goal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
