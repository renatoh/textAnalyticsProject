Abubakar Tariq Nadama was five when he was brought to the US in search of what his parents believed was an alternative way to alleviate autism. They placed their faith in so-called \"chelation\" - a treatment frowned upon by conventional medicine which involves the administration of a liquid that is supposed to remove certain heavy metals from the blood. Proponents of chelation believe that autism is caused by a preservative that contains mercury and that used to be present in vaccines given to children. On August 23 2005 the boy received a third dose of the liquid in the clinic of Dr Roy Kerry, who practices in Greenville, Pennsylvania. Tariq was given an injection of Disodium EDTA and he went into cardiac arrest soon afterwards. An autopsy found the cause of death was a shortage of calcium in the blood as a result of the treatment. Investigators concluded that Dr Kerry had used the wrong fluid - if he had used Calcium Disodium EDTA it would have been harmless. Dr Kerry already faces six disciplinary charges from Pennsylvania's medical licensing authorities. Contacted by the Guardian last night, he said he wished to give no comment. The legal action launched yesterday accuses Dr Kerry of failing to advise the boy's mother of all the risks of chelation and of the appropriate alternatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
