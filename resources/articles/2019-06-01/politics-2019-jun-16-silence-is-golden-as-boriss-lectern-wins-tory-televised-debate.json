It proved to be an inspired move, because the lectern answered the questions far more directly and honestly than Johnson ever would. If only the lectern had taken his place at the foreign affairs select committee, there\u2019s a good chance Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have been released from her Iranian jail by now. Curiously, everyone but Jeremy Hunt chose to ignore the fact that the odds-on favourite to become the next prime minister was otherwise engaged. And he only appeared to notice about halfway through with a slightly embarrassed, \u2018Where\u2019s Boris?\u2019 It was as if someone had shat themselves and everyone was too polite to mention it. Which, come to think of it, was more or less exactly what had happened. Still, at least it gave the others some more airtime. Not that it did many of them much good. It\u2019s been a good 20 years or so since Michael Gove last did cocaine, but he appeared to be still suffering from the after-effects. Angry, edgy, wired and shouty. Asked to take the first question on how he would win an election against Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn he merely insisted he would win because he was the best, and became increasingly bewildered and tetchy when nobody clapped anything he said. \u201cI\u2019ve put everything on the line,\u201d he later added. Under the circumstances, not the best choice of words. Things began to turn nasty when the questions turned to Brexit as Gove, Hunt, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab tried to outdo one another with how hard they were. A contest in which there was only ever going to be one winner. Raab had clearly been briefed to try to remember to smile but it wasn\u2019t long before the anger vein on his forehead was throbbing as the steroids coursed through his veins. When Rory Stewart called him out for being deranged, it looked as if Raab was seconds away from taking an axe to him. And then taking out the entire audience. The new muscular Conservatism. \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d Hunt replied irrelevantly to almost every question. He didn\u2019t look much like a businessman. With his Union Jack lapel badge he seemed more like a British Airways senior cabin steward on a long-haul flight. Javid wisely chose not to mention that he\u2019d made a fortune as a banker selling credit default swaps in the run up to the financial crisis, but still tried to pull macho rank. He was a man who got things done even though he couldn\u2019t point to anything he\u2019d actually got done. Needless to say, throughout all this no one was able to explain just how they were going to deliver Brexit. So no one was the wiser about anything. About an hour in, despite the best efforts of presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy to jolly things along, the debate began to flag rather. Each candidate sobbed gently at the current state of the education, health and social care system, apparently unaware they had been responsible for their decline over the past nine years. Suddenly, the Poirot repeat on ITV3 seemed an attractive option. Thank God for the adverts, which included a trailer for Celebrity Crystal Maze. The comparisons were unmissable. A bunch of chimps would stand more chance of working as a team than the five Tories on show. Things did perk up with a leftfield question about what each man considered to be his weakness. Gove went first. \u201cImpatience,\u201d he snarled. Along with modesty. He was such a go-getting, high achiever that people had trouble keeping up with him. \u201cAs an entrepreneur,\u201d sobbed Hunt. People sometimes thought he was a pushover, but actually he was a real hardman. Just ask the bloke in seat 27F who hadn\u2019t worn his seat belt. Javid\u2019s confession was that he should have bought the family a dog sooner. Really. Raab twitched shiftily. Now probably wasn\u2019t the time to mention he had multiple convictions for road rage attacks. At which point, Stewart stole the show. He was frail. He was ignorant. Other people knew more than him. He sometimes changed his mind. Now it wasn\u2019t just Raab who wanted to kill him. All the others did too. Why hadn\u2019t they thought of talking human? The audience gave Stewart a loud round of applause. As indeed they had all night. Rory fluttered his eyelids and smiled bashfully. He\u2019d won the debate hands down, but it would count for little. His electorate wasn\u2019t either the audience or the viewers. It was the other Tory MPs and members and they had long since made up their mind. The lectern had it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
