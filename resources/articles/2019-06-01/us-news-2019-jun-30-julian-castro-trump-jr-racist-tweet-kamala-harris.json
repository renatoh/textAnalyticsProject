Racist criticism of Harris proliferated online after Thursday\u2019s second debate, in which she shone in opposition to former vice-president Joe Biden, particularly when she grilled him over his past opposition to bussing as a way to racially integrate schools. Harris announced a fundraising surge after the debate, with $2m coming in over 24 hours. The RealClearPolitics.com national polling average puts her fourth in the Democratic field, behind Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. During the debate on Thursday, Donald Trump\u2019s oldest son reposted a message from Ali Alexander, a far-right personality, which said: \u201cKamala Harris is implying she is descended from American Black Slaves. She\u2019s not. She comes from Jamaican Slave Owners. That\u2019s fine. She\u2019s not an American Black. Period.\u201d \u201cIs this true?\u201d Trump Jr asked. \u201cWow.\u201d Harris\u2019s father is Jamaican and her mother was from India. Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and US housing secretary, who would be the first Hispanic president, performed strongly in the first debate on Wednesday. On Sunday he appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said of Trump Jr\u2019s tweet. \u201cIt has no place in our politics. This is the game that these folks play. They put something out there. You notice what he did. He tweeted it out and then he deleted it like a coward, so he can say, \u2018Oh, that was a mistake.\u2019 \u201cBut he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris. We need to dispel them immediately and condemn them and then not give them any more life, because they\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Castro was not alone in defending the senator and criticising Trump Jr. Most of the Democratic candidates did so. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, for example, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump Jr is a racist too. Shocker.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, wrote: \u201cKamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It\u2019s long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks.\u201d That was a reference to \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theorists who claim Barack Obama, born to an American mother and a Kenyan father, was not born in the US and was thus not qualified to be president. Donald Trump rose to political prominence by championing such attacks, before admitting Obama was born in the US. Some rightwing social media accounts have accused Harris of being an \u201canchor baby\u201d \u2013 a derogatory term used to describe children born in the US to immigrant parents. Also on CNN on Sunday, Amy Klobuchar was asked if she believed attacks on Harris were being generated by Russians, as she seemed to imply in her first response to Trump Jr\u2019s tweet. \u201cI have no idea who\u2019s responsible for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just know that [Russia has] messed around on the internet many times with bots and other things and there has been some connection to them way past the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI think the bigger point I was making in light of President Trump hanging out with Vladimir Putin again is that we as a country are supposed to be about the truth.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
