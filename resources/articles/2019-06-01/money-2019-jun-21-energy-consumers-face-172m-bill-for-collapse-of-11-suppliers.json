Citizens Advice said almost 30 million households will need to bail out the bust energy suppliers through their bills, while 32,000 may also be targeted aggressively by debt collectors hired by their administrators. The charity said it has helped more than a thousand consumers left \u201cdistressed and anxious\u201d by the collapse of their supplier because administrators are not bound by the same consumer protection laws as typical collection agencies. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cConsumers shouldn\u2019t have to foot the multimillion pound bill left behind when companies collapse \u2013 and they certainly shouldn\u2019t lose their usual protections in the process.\u201d Citizens Advice has called on the government to close the gap between the protections offered to customers of live energy suppliers and those who have gone bust. It has also urged Ofgem to limit the cost of future supplier failures. \u201cIt must act now,\u201d Guy said. Ofgem has overseen the spiralling multimillion pound hit for bill payers by spreading the unpaid cost of renewable energy and grid upgrades across the energy market when a supplier goes under. Under its \u201csafety net\u201d procedure it hands the customers of a failed energy company to another supplier before reclaiming the unpaid costs via energy bills. Energy UK, the industry\u2019s trade group, said the regulator was forced to use this process \u201cmore than ever expected\u201d after lowering the minimum standards for new energy suppliers to encourage more competition for the big six incumbent suppliers. Ofgem said earlier this year that it plans to stress test prospective energy suppliers to make sure they are financially fit to provide an essential service before granting them a supply licence. \u201cThe increase in competition and the number of suppliers in recent years have been great for customers in providing choice and driving down prices,\u201d Energy UK said. \u201cBut we welcome Ofgem bringing in tougher checks for suppliers entering and operating in the market to ensure they have sustainable business models and are adequately financed to serve their customers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
