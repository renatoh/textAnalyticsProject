And what a way to do it. They headed into the sheds at the break 8-0 down (even though they could easily have had three tries of their own), but a remarkable second-half recovery, led by the irrepressible tryscorer Dane Gagai, ensured Daly Cherry-Evans\u2019 debut as skipper ended in victory. A tremendous game of rugby league, as fast-paced, skilful and brutal as expected. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same when the circus rolls onto Perth for Game 2 on Sunday 23 June. It\u2019s a game NSW now have to win. That\u2019s all from me tonight. I\u2019ll leave you with Nick Tedeschi\u2019s match report. Cheerio. And what about DCE, who marked his Origin captaincy debut with victory. \u201cIt does [feel good]. Everyone here knows how hard it is to win a game of Origin. To get the first one it\u2019s a big effort from the team. Certainly won\u2019t be getting too ahead of ourselves. Half the job.\u201d Josh McGuire praises the officiating tonight. \u201cReferees put the whistle away I thought was good. I thought the referees let us test each ow other out. After that 20 minute mark I thought both teams slowed down. Few opportunities starting to arise for both teams.Come in at half-time not too much possession and missed opportunities. We are confident we score points. No better feeling than winning at home than in front of fans.\u201d Kalyn Ponga is speaking on Channel Nine: \u201cIt was an awesome game. First half was probably definitely the hardest footy I played. Then our boys in the second half were outstanding.We got the win. We were still positive [at half-time]. Created three opportunities to score. Couple of disallowed tries. We knew we were in the game. We weren\u2019t behind or anything at all. We weren\u2019t in front. We came out in the second half and gave it to them.\u201d Phew. Hectic stuff towards the end there. I\u2019ll catch my breath and some final thoughts to follow shortly. And two-try Maroon hero Dane Gagai: \u201cLike I always say it\u2019s off the back of hard work and effort from the boys. There was a set there where it was going back and forward. We managed to lock them in. The boys was a massive set and they ended up kicking out of 20 or 30. It makes my job easier when I\u2019m catching around 40 and 50.\u201d Gracious words from Damian Cook: \u201cIt\u2019s always special up here. As a new South Welshman you love coming up here. They make it extra hard. Great turn out. State of Origin is the best game. Great turn out and great footy. Would have been nice to get the win.\u201d What a game! Something of an instant classic. Here\u2019s Cameron Munster: \u201cKnew it was going to be hard physical game. We knew we had to grind the 08 minutes there and keep the ball in play. Play to the game plan. Did that in the second half. It was frustrating at times. I knew I was. Remained a couple of line breaks there. Didn\u2019t do the icing on the cake. We knew if we kept to gameplan in the second half we scored points we showed that tonight.\u201d 80 min: Last play for the Blues, but Cotric can\u2019t get on the end of the kick and the ball runs out of play! All over and the Maroons draw first blood! 78 min: It opens up for Mitchell and he bullocks his way towards the line as Ponga bounces off him, but hasn\u2019t quite got the momentum to get past the remaining Maroons defenders! This is going right down to the wire. 77 min: Gagai earns his crust (if he hadn\u2019t already) by taking a high, swirling bomb in his own half, under pressure from a posse of blue shirts. Excellent, and important, catch. 76 min: The conversion is taken quickly by Cleary and it\u2019s good. Surely not.... 75 min: Hang on! Trbojevic scores for the Blues as barges over from close range! And the game is back on! 74 min: It\u2019s going to have to be a comeback for the ages now for NSW. Frizell barrels his way to within a metre or so from the Maroons line, but they\u2019ve got him wrapped up. 72 min: Ponga gets it this time and the hosts have opened up a 10-point lead with less than 10 minutes remaining. 71 min: Gagai! He squeezes in at the corner and there\u2019s nothing Mitchell can do to stop it. It\u2019s given the green light and you\u2019d think the Maroons are home and dry now. It stemmed from a brilliant pass by Ponga, but there was still a lot to do by Gagai. That\u2019s his 11th in 11 Origin games. Incredible. 70 min: Oh dear it\u2019s all going wrong for NSW now. Tedesco loses the ball and the Maroons pick it up less than 10m out. 68 min: Ponga\u2019s off target with the conversion and the lead is just four points. But the momentum is very much with the Maroons. 67 min: Intercepted by Gagai, right on his own try line! He sprints all the way to the other end of the pitch and gleefully touches down! He just telegraphed that one from Jack Wighton! Nothing less than the Maroons deserve to be honest. 64 min: The Maroons look in control of the game now. They get another set of six, 20m out, but the Blues get a lucky deflection and the ball lands neatly in Addo-Carr\u2019s grateful arms. The pressure valve is turned slightly. 62 min: Queensland charge forward and twice keep the move going with passes from first Ponga and then DCE when they were in the clutches of opponents. Hunt ends up with the ball but he can\u2019t weave any magic this time. 61 min: Cotric has hit the turf and seems to be in some pain. It\u2019s his knee that\u2019s bothering him. At least everyone gets a chance to take a breath as he\u2019s seen to by the medics. 60 min: An hour gone, and it\u2019s Queensland who are in the ascendency now. They\u2019ve just evened the ledger and are a man up for the next 10 minutes. NSW are under the pump. 59 min: Ponga opts to take the penalty goal. He nails it and we\u2019re all square in Brisbane. 58 min: No penalty try is the call, much to the disappointment of the massed ranks of Queenslanders in the stands. The ref\u2019s call was that he couldn\u2019t be sure Gillett would have scored a try. The locals\u2019 mood is improved moments later though as Mitchell is dispatched to the sin bin for 10 minutes, for a professional foul. 58 min: Massive chance for the Maroons as Gillett is impeded by Tedesco and Mitchell as he tries to run onto a kick into the Blues\u2019 in-goal. And there may be a penalty try though for interference on Gillett. 58 min: The crowd appear to be going nuts and the Maroons will look to ride that wave of fervour now. 57 min: Confirmed, no try. More impressive, last-ditch defending by the Blues. But they\u2019re under the cosh here. 56 min: Queensland look dangerous at the moment. Morgan surges over the line but it looks like the Blues have managed to keep him on his back, turtle-like, and hold the ball up. Still, they\u2019ll have a look at it. 55 min: A silly penalty to give away by Payne Haas here. Absolutely no need for him to shove the Maroons player to the ground as he\u2019s trying to play the ball. 52,191 is the crowd here tonight, by the way. 54 min: Ponga takes his head gear off, as is his way, before setting himself for the kick. It\u2019s tight, but the ball comes back just enough, before scraping the post and going through! 53 min: Oates does score this time! It\u2019s a carbon copy try of the disallowed effort in the first half \u2013 a huge Superman-like leap in the corner, and this time the foot he boosts off remains in play before he touches down. Spectacular stuff from Oates and the locals like that one! 51 min: \u201cI feel good,\u201d says coach Fittler. \u201cDefence first 10 minutes looked solid. We haven\u2019t stopped playing. Be good if we got in better position come out of trouble. We had that good ball down the other end and one several coming off our own line. That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d 49 min: Young Fifita is on, and here he is making some key tackles close to the NSW goal line. That\u2019ll give him some confidence. 47 min: Ponga sweeps up in his own in-goal, dancing out of trouble before he\u2019s grounded by a posse of hungry Blues. 46 min: Quick word on the forgotten aspect of Origin \u2013 the biffo. In short, there\u2019s been absolutely none. Plenty of big hits and hard tackling, but no aggro at all. 44 min: Here\u2019s a bit more on the anthem boycott from earlier. 43 min: Ponga makes a hash of a high ball \u2013 he falls over and spills the ball. Not an auspicious start to the second period for the youngster. 42 min: On the way out of the sheds, Queensland coach Kevin Walters said his side need to tighten up their defence. \u201cMissed about 26 tackles. That\u2019s not where we needed to be. But we\u2019re creating good opportunities with our attack. That\u2019s moving nicely. Got to fix up tighten up our defence a bit. Get that right in the second half. It will create opportunities with our attack. We have to keep believing. Great test in the second half. I 100% believe we\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d 41 min: Mitchell, who was probably the most underwhelming player during that electric first half, gets us back underway for the second half. Ponga tries to catch his breath and talk at the same time on his way off the field. He\u2019s struggling to do both, to be honest. \u201cWe created opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to execute them. We\u2019re creative. We should execute them.\u201d Tedesco: \u201cJust around the ruck our forwards getting tired. Working around that middle. Create some havoc.\u201d 40 min: And that will be that for the half. What a breathless half of Origin football. Plenty to enjoy there. And the Blues head in with an all-important lead. 39 min: Munster makes some metres with a jinking run and the pressure on the NSW defence increases. But they do enough to hold out and the Maroons run out of tackles. 38 min: Two minutes left in the half and that could prove to be a costly penalty by Mitchell. Queensland will look to finally get on the scoreboard in the dying moments of this half. They\u2019re 5m out from the try line... 37 min: Addo-Carr leaps into the night sky and makes a crucial interception. Any misjudgement there and Ponga\u2019s pass would have surely resulted in a try for Queensland. 35 min: This is set up very nicely now. The home side, spurred on by a partisan crowd, chasing the game a bit. 33 min: There might have been a time, in the not-so-distant past when NSW would be three tries down here. But their last-ditch defending is much improved - it\u2019s almost like they believe in themselves in the cauldron of Suncorp. 31 min: Another chance goes begging for the Maroons, after some brilliant work by Munster. He offloads to Chambers who is closed down by Tedesco and when he tries to flick the ball back to somebody, anybody, there\u2019s no Maroons teammates there to help out. 30 min: That\u2019s a let-off for the Blues, and you wonder how the Maroons will respond to that disappointment \u2013 their players were convinced they\u2019d scored and were all back on the halfway line when the verdict was delivered. 29 min: The Maroons get on the scoreboard as they take full advantage of a kick that strikes the post and bounces back! No Blues player can get on it and amid the confusion, Napa gets there to touch down with his forearms! But wait. They\u2019re having a very good look at it. NO TRY! He didn\u2019t have control of the ball! Big call to make. But probably the right one, after much video scrutiny. 29 min: Ponga\u2019s ability to change direction in a heartbeat is truly incredible. Mitchell doesn\u2019t fall for it this time though and he makes a key tackle. 28 min: Hunt opts against the kick at goal, and plays the ball. Another penalty to the Maroons follows as Walker is pulled up for a second pop at Oates. Still they opt against the kick. 27 min: But here go Queensland. End to end stuff at Suncorp. Ponga high-steps as he looks to find a way through. And we\u2019re all given some respite as the Maroons win a penalty. Phew. 26 min: Oh, brilliant stuff from Cook, who breaks clear before passing out of the back of his hand! Kafusi makes a try-saving tackle! 23 min: The pace has been relentless this half. Even more so than usual in an Origin game? It seems that way. NSW are on top here, no doubt. Here goes Tedesco again, who opts not to pass out wide; he runs into traffic inside instead. 21 min: Cleary, from a wide angle, bends it through the posts! Cracking kick from the youngster! NSW have an eight-point lead in Brisbane. 20 min: Morris barges over the line for the first try of the game, but it\u2019s all about Tedesco again, who shimmies his way through the challenge of Munster before offloading to Morris, who just has to use his momentum to get over! 19 min: Munster grounds the ball in Queensland\u2019s in-goal under pressure from Tedesco who races onto Cook\u2019s grubber through. They\u2019re having a second look at this as there is doubt whether Munster does indeed get his hand to the ball. Replays show he does - eventually. That was a close one, but the Maroons got away with it. 18 min: So, the good news is that there was no doubt about that try being ruled out. Oates\u2019 boot was clearly out of play. The bad news for Maroons fans is that NSW are on the attack again. 17 min: Decibel levels spike as Oates takes to the air and touches down in the corner, following a thrilling attacking move, which saw the ball cross the entire width of the field. The crowd love it \u2013 but not for long, as it\u2019s ruled out. Oates\u2019 foot went out of play! 15 min: Addo-Carr hoons off on another return, stretching those lengthy legs of his. Moments later Cook makes a break through the first line of Maroon defence. This is frenetic stuff. 13 min: Points on the board! Queensland give away a penalty and Cleary takes the chance to have a kick at goal. He nails it and the Blues have an early lead. 12 min: NSW are 20m out. Klemmer barges forward and the visitors are now less than 10 from the Maroons\u2019 tryline. 11 min: Queensland are pulled back after Gagai gets a hand to a Mitchell flicked pass. He races after the ball but it\u2019s a knock-on. 10 min: A quarter of the way through the first half, and Tedesco does what he does best \u2013 jinking inside and out, swivelling those hips as he gets away from a Maroon challenge. 9 min: As expected, this is being played at a rip-roaring pace. Plenty to enjoy so far. Here goes Cotric, with a powerful run for the Blues. 7 min: Nice play from Tedesco, who offloads to Morris. NSW are looking good here. Cleary now dinks the ball through hoping Tedesco can sprint onto it, but it bounces out of play just before the Roosters star can reach it. Blues danger abounds. 6 min: Ponga picks up a grubber played through towards the try line and is immediately hit high. He rides it though and is up on his feet before too long. 4 min: Oof. Ponga gets hit hard and then Frizell delivers a late shot. NSW win the ball back and now they finally get over halfway. Klemmer shows all his size and strength to carry the ball further upfield. 3 min: Cordner gets hit after playing the ball, but he\u2019s up and running again soon enough. Papalii has a run before Gillett does likewise. Tedesco takes a high ball soon after and the Blues will try to get out of their own half once again \u2013 something they haven\u2019t managed so far. 2 min: \u201cQueenslander, Queenslander\u201d is the roar from the crowd as they take the ball for the first time. Munster boots high and deep at the end of the set and NSW will come again. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Queensland get the game underway, and Klemmer has his first battering ram-like run of the night. An acknowledgement of country from JT precedes the anthem sung by Lucy Maunder. More than a few players joining Walker et al in not singing it. Cheers from the crowd follow the completion of it. And we\u2019re nearly ready to get going. Here come the players. Out come the Blues, to a predictable reception from the hospitable Queenslanders. Impossible to imagine what they\u2019re feeling at this point. And here come the Maroons, led by DCE as the Blues line up and link arms. Anthem to come. And here\u2019s Kevin Walters, Fittler\u2019s counterpart, who\u2019s being drowned out a bit by his players running through a few drills in the background. \u201cOpening 10 minutes, certainly [is the most important thing for Queensland tonight]. Just to get out of the blocks really nicely. How we want to play. That is being nice and aggressive with our defence and completing our sets. Getting through our sets. Defensively we have got to be really strong tonight and that is a big part of it as well. I\u2019ve said it all week, I\u2019m really excited about these 17 Queensland players. As a group, they\u2019ve worked together beautifully and tonight, we get a chance to see all of their work that they have done throughout the week.\u201d Here\u2019s NSW coach Brad Fittler, speaking on Channel Nine: \u201cI definitely feel alive at the moment. It is great watching the boys warming up. Sitting amongst the coaches. The heart is racing. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else. I think what we did last year gives us a lot of confidence. Watching them how they handled training. It feels like we are better than we were last year.I can\u2019t see us not doing a good job. If we were to get beat, Queensland will have to do a hell of a job. I think we have got to be aggressors early. We spoke about that. So they are very important that. So they are very important that we get off to a good start.\u201d Twenty minutes to go. A final chance to have a read of Larissa O\u2019Connor\u2019s match preview. To think that only 34 points separate the two teams over 37 Origin series shows just how close this contest has been over time and gives reason to why this epic state battle eclipses any national representative match in popularity and number of TV eyeballs. The stage is set at Suncorp Stadium, league\u2019s most intimidating and stirring amphitheatre, and it may be that the location might just prove the difference. Some music. And it\u2019s Briggs! Decent showing from the hiphop star. Meanwhile, stats: AFP raids on the ABC. Is nothing sacred anymore? There are fears tonight\u2019s game will be missed by ABC staff stuck in a room looking at computer files with the feds. Disturbing on many levels. Cody Walker is one of those making his Origin debut tonight, although his story is perhaps more inspirational than most. Asked why he didn\u2019t make his NRL debut until the ripe old age of 26, he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t have everything it takes to be an NRL footballer. Didn\u2019t like to turn up to training. Didn\u2019t like diet. I didn\u2019t want to be a footballer away from footy. It wasn\u2019t until my missus got pregnant, it just sort of clicked mind into gear that I really needed to do something. I sort of grew up in that split-second and I had to. I had no other choice. I had to build my reputation up to be, you know, a good trainer. One that had a good work ethic, one that made changes within his diet. All of those sort of things. It took me a little while to get there. But I didn\u2019t want to give up so early because if I\u2019m teaching my kids to chase their dream, how can I tell them to chase their dream if I didn\u2019t do everything possible to chase mine.\u201d The national anthem. It\u2019s been one of the biggest talking points since last week\u2019s announcement by Cody Walker that he will remain silent during tonight\u2019s pre-match rendition of Advance Australia Fair. Walker will be joined by Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell and Will Chambers in their boycott and while the issue has split the rugby league community (judging by social media reaction over the past week), there\u2019s has been nothing but support from within the respective Origin camps. \u201cRespect\u201d has been the buzz word from players and coaches alike; we\u2019ll soon find out if that respect has filtered through to the Suncorp crowd. Here\u2019s Jack Latimore if anyone still needs things explaining: One of the players who\u2019s getting Maroon juices flowing is Kalyn Ponga, who starts for Queensland \u2013 and fills Billy Slater\u2019s shoes, not that he wants to do that. \u201cI want to make my own, that is how I\u2019m going to go about it. I\u2019m excited to see and feel just how enormous that crowd is going to be. I played last year and it was obviously a bit more blue jerseys, but hopefully we will have more Maroons this year. I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. The boys are out there, the family, coaches, just anyone that\u2019s had any bit of me being here, I want to do them proud and give it my all.\u201d Earlier, the young Queenslanders won the Under-18s game. A good omen? Evans above. Apologies for that, but Daly Cherry-Evans\u2019 ascension to the captaincy of Queensland has been nothing short of miraculous. Here is the man who will lead out the Maroons tonight: \u201cIt\u2019s a special occasion for me and the family, so I\u2019m looking forward to it. I daresay they\u2019d be pretty proud.\u201d When asked about what\u2019s important tonight, he says: \u201cNot necessarily the captaincy, it\u2019s the number on my back, No 7. That direction from me is going to be important for the side tonight. Everyone\u2019s going to get a little bit nervous at some stage but when we\u2019re out there, we have got to trust that we\u2019ve prepared well and this is what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re here to put on a performance and we have trained really well an put ourselves in a position to do that.\u201d And here\u2019s Larissa O\u2019Connor on DCE: Sex, lies and video. It\u2019s been a rather strange buildup to tonight\u2019s opener. Indeed, a buildup \u201clike no other\u201d, the TV has just said. I\u2019ve got to be careful what I say here, but one of the more bizarre moments (in a pretty competitive field) came with the leaked sex tape allegedly featuring a NSW player, who wasn\u2019t the player at all. The mind boggles how NSW officials came to the conclusion it wasn\u2019t, given the alleged star of the video reportedly didn\u2019t show his face. Anyway, it certainly did come at a curious time. Very odd. And we haven\u2019t even started about the motivational gurus. The teams. A reminder that Queensland have named three debutants, NSW five. Queensland: Kalyn Ponga, Corey Oates, Will Chambers, Michael Morgan, Dane Gagai, Cameron Munster, Daly Cherry-Evans, Jai Arrow, Ben Hunt, Josh Papalii, Felise Kaufusi, Matt Gillett, Josh McGuire. Interchange: Moses Mbye, Dylan Napa, Joe Ofahengaue, David Fifita. NSW: James Tedesco, Nick Cotric, Latrell Mitchell, Josh Morris, Josh Addo-Carr, Cody Walker, Nathan Cleary, David Klemmer, Damien Cook, Paul Vaughan, Boyd Cordner, Tyson Frizell, Jake Trbojevic. Interchange: Jack Wighton, Payne Haas, Cameron Murray, Angus Crichton. Here we go then. Game 1 of the 2019 Origin series, a game like no other. Early ascendency, territorial superiority and bragging rights are all up for grabs at Suncorp tonight as the Blues begin their quest to retain the shield for the first time since 2005. In that time, the Maroons have managed to defend their crown nine times, a stat that highlights a seriously maroon-tinged dominance over recent history. But is that all changing? Last year\u2019s series win by the Blues, coupled with the staggered loss of Queensland\u2019s experienced spine \u2013 Greg Inglis, Billy Slater, Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston or Cooper Cronk \u2013 has New South Wales awash with hope. Of course, hope is the source of all disappointment. Never mind, there\u2019s as much in evidence north of the border as there is to the south, given the exciting young things that will pull on a Maroons shirt tonight. It all makes for a tantalising prospect. Two young sides packed with fresh, pacy talent, who will go at each other from the off. On paper, it\u2019s too tight to call and it may well come down to which individuals deals with the occasion the better. Kick off is slated for 8:10pm AEST. So an actual start time of 8:22pm is my guess. Do stick around for that \u2013 plenty of talking points to address in the buildup too. And feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mike_hytner) in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
