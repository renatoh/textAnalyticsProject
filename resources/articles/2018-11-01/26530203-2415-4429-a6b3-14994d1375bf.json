The shadow chancellor repeated that a general election remained a preference but admitted it was \u201cvery difficult to do\u201d because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. \u201cIf that\u2019s not possible, we\u2019ll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to judge each stage, but that\u2019s the sequence I think that we\u2019ll inevitably go through over this period.\u201d Asked to confirm that he thought this was \u201cinevitable\u201d, McDonnell said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Our policy is if we can\u2019t get a general election, then the other option which we\u2019ve kept on the table is a people\u2019s vote.\u201d The strength of McDonnell\u2019s comments about the prospect of a new referendum in recent days has threatened to open up a faultline between him and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who is reported to be far more lukewarm about the idea. Some shadow cabinet members confessed to being baffled about the comments on Wednesday, and suggested McDonnell was less enthusiastic about a referendum in private. One asked: \u201cIs he running with the hares and hunting with the hounds?\u201d Labour sought to seize back the agenda last night by publishing the amendment it plans to table to the government\u2019s motion on May\u2019s Brexit deal. The amendment repudiates the deal, saying it \u201cfails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal,\u201d and \u201cis likely to lead to the implementation of a backstop provision in Northern Ireland that is neither politically nor economically sustainable\u201d. It also seeks to take a no deal Brexit off the table, by saying parliament, \u201cdeclines to approve the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement\u201d. And it goes on to say parliament will \u201cpursue every option\u201d to prevent either a no deal, or the government\u2019s deal. The amendment does not touch on a second referendum; but the prime minister seized on McDonnell\u2019s remarks to claim Labour wants to block Brexit. Responding to McDonnell, Theresa May said: \u201cHis comments about the second referendum today show that what the Labour party want to do is frustrate Brexit. They want to overturn the will of the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the British people a vote. They voted to leave. I think it\u2019s a matter of trust in politicians that they actually deliver on Brexit for the British people.\u201d Both McDonnell and Corbyn are acutely conscious that the vast majority of Labour members and many of its MPs are ardently anti-Brexit. They fear alienating a swath of supporters if they ignore the pleas of this group. However, they also believe it is highly unlikely that the idea of a second referendum could command a majority in the House of Commons \u2013 though momentum could build if the meaningful vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal on 11 December is lost. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman insisted on Wednesday that the party\u2019s first priority would be to try to build support for its own, alternative Brexit deal rather than jumping to demand another poll. At a Guardian Live event less than 24 hours earlier, McDonnell had said a second Brexit referendum \u201cmight be an option we seize upon\u201d, suggesting for the first time that remain should be on the ballot paper and insisting that a no-deal Brexit should not. At the event on Tuesday, McDonnell fleshed out his views on how a second referendum should operate and said he personally would vote to remain in any new referendum. That marked another contrast with Corbyn, who said he did not know which way he would vote when asked on Sky News last week. McDonnell said he would vote remain and that the country could not risk putting no-deal as an option on any ballot paper. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming majority in parliament against that happening, because of the damage.\u201d McDonnell said he had recently met leading figures from the People\u2019s Vote campaign, including Alastair Campbell and Ed Miliband\u2019s former adviser Tom Baldwin. He said he expected May to lose the first Commons vote and to present a tweaked deal that he predicted would fail as well. \u201cWhether and when we put a vote of no confidence down will be a tactical decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll want a maximum effect.\u201d He said the party had been meeting to discuss coordination with the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and Caroline Lucas of the Greens. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get a general election, people\u2019s vote is on the table and that might be an option we seize upon,\u201d he said. Before that, Labour would offer its own versions of a deal, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go through that sequence to show we\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s official position is to push its own version of a Brexit deal involving a permanent customs union and a close relationship with the single market that falls short of full membership. Sources close to McDonnell played down any difference in position to Corbyn and said his comments were not a change in policy. Speaking after prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman restated Labour\u2019s position, as agreed at the party\u2019s conference in Liverpool, that should the government lose the vote and a general election not be called, \u201call options would be on the table\u201d. However, he said: \u201cWe do not regard no deal as any kind of option,\u201d and he declined to set out any others, aside from trying to rally parliament behind Labour\u2019s alternative approach. \u201cThe key point is that the option of Labour\u2019s alternative plan has to be on the table, and we believe there is majority support for it in parliament, and it would also command majority support in the country, across both leave and remain voters,\u201d the spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
