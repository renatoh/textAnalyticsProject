The move was widely anticipated after Uefa moved the men\u2019s Euros from this summer to next. The International Olympic Committee pushing back the Tokyo Games, in which senior women\u2019s international teams will compete, will have also been a consideration. Three European teams \u2013 the Netherlands, England and Sweden \u2013 have qualified for the Olympics after finishing as the three best European teams at the Women\u2019s World Cup in France last summer. When asked for comment on the claim, Uefa said: \u201cNo formal decision [on the postponement of the women\u2019s Euros] has been made yet but it is indeed a likely option.\u201d Uefa met on Wednesday to discuss options for this season\u2019s competitions as well as its international tournaments. It has postponed all its games until further notice, including June\u2019s women\u2019s Euro play-offs. The postponement of the tournament will ease pressure on the qualifying calendar. England have qualified for the women\u2019s Euros as hosts of the competition. The group winners and three best runners-up will join the Lionesses in the final tournament. However, qualifying only began after the World Cup last summer and is less than halfway through its group stage. With the play-off draw initially scheduled for 25 September and those matches due to take place in October, there was little wriggle room for a rescheduling of the June matches. Last week the Norwegian FA announced that the men\u2019s European Championship had been moved before Uefa\u2019s announcement. Wednesday\u2019s Danish FA statement read: \u201cThe women\u2019s Euros and the [men\u2019s] Under-21 European Championship is moved from the summer of 2021 to the following summer because of the fact that both the Olympics and the men\u2019s Euros will take place in the summer of 2021.\u201d The additional year gives the FA time to help women\u2019s football recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic but will leave them with a decision to make over the future of the manager Phil Neville, whose contract expires in 2021. Extending Neville\u2019s tenure will be complicated by the short turnaround between the 2022 Euros and the 2023 World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
