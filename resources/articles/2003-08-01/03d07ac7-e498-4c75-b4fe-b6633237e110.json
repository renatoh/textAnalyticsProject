Blinking back tears, he glanced at his son Matthew. He was a free man. As the sun streamed through the window of his Halifax home, Mitchell could hardly believe he was back with his family. Just three days earlier he was facing death by decapitation. Home for him was a dark prison cell, the only source of light a weak, flickering bulb. Mealtimes were profoundly depressing: usually lumpen rice served cold. In order to cling to sanity, the 44-year-old had given up hope of ever seeing Noi and three-year-old son Matthew again. Mitchell could only guess what his son looked like now during the interminable 30 months he spent imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. Occasionally he would think of his son growing old without his father, but always in the back of his mind was the public beheading that the Saudi authorities had decreed his fate. For the five other Britons who flew into London on flight BA number 1262 on Friday afternoon, similar reunions were being played out across the country. Across the Pennines in Manchester James Cottle relaxed with his family. Delighted though they were to have him back, they were, however, stunned at his appearance. Two-and-a-half years in a Saudi prison had taken their toll and Cottle shed six-and-a-half stone during his internment. 'His head is half the size it was. His skin seems to be hanging off him,' said former wife Mary Martini yesterday. Now the six Britons must somehow begin the task of rebuilding their lives. It will not be easy. Their ordeal during which they claim they were systematically tortured, will take some getting over. Already Cottle has told family and friends he may 'start cracking up.' Similar concerns are shared by those who know Glenn Ballard, the last Briton to be arrested. Ballard endured the last ten months in solitary confinement and even yesterday has no idea why he was imprisoned. The Saudi authorities have failed to charge him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
