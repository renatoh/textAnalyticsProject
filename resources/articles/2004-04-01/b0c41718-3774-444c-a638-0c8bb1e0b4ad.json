Apart from putting pressure on their coach Carlo Ancelotti after his \"cavalier\" tactics of playing two strikers and an attacking midfielder drew widespread criticism, the defeat could also impact on Italy's plans for Euro 2004. If the national team coach Giovanni Trapattoni was watching events at the Riazor Stadium - and he surely was - he must now be having second thoughts about inviting Paolo Maldini to come out of international retirement for the summer. Maldini was not the only offender on a night of uncharacteristic Milan defending but he was culpable of several lapses as Deportivo overturned a 4-1 deficit to win 5-4. Maldini quit international football after the World Cup in 2002, deciding to commit himself to Milan for the rest of his playing days. That was initially accepted by Trapattoni, until he realised just how well Maldini was still performing at Milan. Since then it has become a minor obsession of the former Juventus and Internazionale coach to bring Maldini back for one last summer tournament - the man who made his debut for Milan at the age of 16 will turn 36 during Euro 2004. But perhaps Wednesday's display in the fragmented Milan back line was the damning proof Trapattoni needed that Maldini is no longer the sturdy rock upon which the Italian defence was built for many years. Just as disconcerting to the Azzurri coach might have been the performance of Alessandro Nesta, whose error allowed Albert Luque the time and space in which to ram home Deportivo's third goal of the night a minute before half-time. The Brazilian full-back Cafu admitted that Milan had rolled over under pressure from the home side. \"Deportivo dominated the game and we were not able to put up resistance to their pressure. Are we in a crisis? I think it is too early to speak in these words.\" The Italian press was far less circumspect. \"The fall of the Gods\" was the headline in La Gazzetta dello Sport that greeted the Milan players as they woke up yesterday morning. The defeat was \"a black page in the history of one of the world's greatest clubs\", it added. \"Collapse of Italian soccer,\" said the Roman sports daily Corriere dello Sport, commenting on the \"unbelievable elimination\" of the team owned by the premier Silvio Berlusconi and the end of Italy's involvement in European competition this season. The result, Milan's worst defeat in the competition for more than 40 years, was more remarkable given that the Italians had not conceded a goal away from home in the Champions League this season and no team had previously overcome a three-goal deficit. Not surprisingly Deportivo believe they can go on to win the trophy. \"We have achieved something historic by winning this game,\" said the midfielder V\u00edctor. \"We played a perfect game and the team is really keen to show that we can achieve something big this season.\" \"No one gave us a chance before the game,\" added the Brazilian Mauro Silva, who had an outstanding game at the centre of the home midfield. \"But we showed that anything is possible in the Champions League. It is important that we now keep our feet on the ground, but winning the Champions League would be absolutely brilliant.\" Depor will face last season's Uefa Cup winners Porto in the semi-finals and once again have the advantage of playing the second leg at home. \"It's going to be a very tough tie because Porto have been in excellent form over the last two years,\" said the Deportivo coach Javier Irureta, who had pledged to make a pilgrimage to St James's tomb in Santiago de Compostela if his team managed to beat Milan. \"I will honour my promise to make the journey to Santiago. After all, this has certainly been a week of miracles.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
