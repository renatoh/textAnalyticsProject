He has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident, said West Yorkshire police, which also recovered a vehicle. The force released a CCTV still image earlier on Monday of a Vauxhall Astra they were attempting to trace in connection with the investigation into the incident in Brudenell Road, Hyde Park, on Saturday. Sabah Saleem remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital, while her two-year-old brother, Rayhaan Saleem, is improving and has been moved from the ICU unit at Leeds General Infirmary. The children had gone to a local shop to buy some onions for their mother, who was preparing for Eid celebrations, and were crossing the road when they were struck. Police said the driver slowed down to see what had happened, then sped away. Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor who is leading the inquiry, said that police were making progress with the investigation, which was drawing on specialist resources from across the force, including homicide officers and a specialist major collision inquiry team. He described what happened on Saturday as a \"truly shocking incident in a very close knit community\" and added that police were determined to leave no stone unturned to locate the driver involved. He added: \"Clearly it remains the case that it would be better for this individual to contact us before we come to see them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
