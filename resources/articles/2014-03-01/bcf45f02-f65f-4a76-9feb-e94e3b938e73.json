It was the 21-year-old's first senior medal, and it was in a discipline that comprises only one-seventh of her preferred event, the heptathlon. She was a multi-event generalist against hardened specialists, yet a personal best of 6.81m left her second to France's \u00c9loyse Lesueur, who jumped 6.85m. Another silver in the men's 4x400m relay, as well as bronzes for Andrew Osagie in the men's 800m and the women's 4x400m, took the final British medal haul to six \u2013 their joint-third highest at a world indoor championships and fourth in the medal table. Given the absence of Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and James Dasaolu it was understandable that the British athletics performance director, Neil Black, excitable even in the down times, hailed his team's performance as \"fantastic\". \"I hadn't set a medal target \u2026 but I think if I had, I would have been very pleased with six,\" he said. But it was Johnson-Thompson's star that shone brightest on the final day. She was not expected to do well after being forced to switch to the long jump after falling ill before a pentathlon qualifying event last month. And, as she admitted afterwards, she had felt \"very down\" watching the event on Friday. Then her spirits, as well as her reputation, soared. \"I can't really believe it,\" she said. \"I came here with no expectations but thought if everyone has a bad day then I might sneak a medal.\" Britain's men's 4x400m relay team were less bubbly after finishing second to the United States, who broke the world indoor record in 3 minutes 02.13. As Nigel Levine, who steered the British men home in 3 minutes 03.49 ahead of Jamaica, joylessly put it: \"We came here for gold but we'll have to settle for silver.\" In the men's 800m, Osagie appeared to have missed out on a medal after an unconvincing tactical display left him with too much to do on the last lap. But after crossing the line fourth, 0.01 sec behind the Polish athlete Marcin Lewandowski, he was bumped up after the British team won their appeal that Lewandowski had stepped into the in-field on the final bend. \"It's not the way you want to win a medal but it's part of racing,\" said Osagie, who matched his bronze from two years ago in Istanbul. \"Tactically I didn't run that well. Apart from the medal, I don't have a lot of positives to take away from the indoor season.\" In the women's 4x400m relay the British team of Eilidh Child, Shana Cox, Margaret Adeoye and Christine Ohuruogu ran almost a second faster than they did when winning gold at these championships in 2012, but their time of 3:27.90 was only good for bronze behind the US team, who won in 3:24.83, and Jamaica. Elsewhere there were a few near misses and understandable frustrations. In the pole vault Holly Bleasdale had claimed that she was in shape to beat her personal best of 4.83m but failed three times at 4.65m and finished ninth. What hurt even more was that the Cuban Yarisley Silva took gold with a clearance of just 4.70m \u2013 a height Bleasdale has cleared three times this year. In the men's 60m hurdles final Andrew Pozzi ran a personal best of 7.53sec in finishing fourth behind the American Omo Osaghae \u2013 a position matched by Asha Phillip, who could only watch as the Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce scampered away from her in 6.98, the sixth fastest time in history, to win the women's 60m. Veronica Campbell-Brown, competing in her first event since her two-year ban from the IAAF was overturned, finished fifth in 7.13, just behind Philip who ran 7.11. Meanwhile Richard Kilty has set his sights on becoming only the third British athlete to break the 10-second barrier for the 100m after his shock win in the men's 60m on Saturday. Kilty, a 24-year-old from Stockton, finished third in the British trials last month but got the chance to compete in Sopot when Dasaolu injured his thigh. He said: \"I'm not going to say I'm going to do it this year but I think I can run well into nine seconds. I know that's a pretty big statement with my skin colour, being white, but I wouldn't mind being the next man to break 10 seconds.\" Kilty also revealed how close he was to leaving athletics after failing to make London 2012 or get national lottery funding last year. \"I did consider quitting,\" he admitted. \"I was training twice a week, I had no income. I had to sometimes run on the roads in trainers. I couldn't even afford to get to the track. I was living in Middlesbrough. \"Nobody had it harder than me in Britain last year. I was considering going into the army. I had to look into it as I had no form of income. Now I feel like crying. It's a dream come true.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
