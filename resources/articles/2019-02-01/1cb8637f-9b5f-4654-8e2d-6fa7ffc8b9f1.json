Wales are looking for a record 12th consecutive victory but they have not beaten England in the Six Nations since 2013 and know another defeat will all but ensure their rivals secure the title for a third time in four years. \u201cHome games are partly won on emotion and it is about how you control that,\u201d Owens says. \u201cIt is important to keep a lid on things and the coaches have been spot on with the way they have handled that over the years. \u201cTraining will be a bit tasty this week, which it will need to be with what is coming up. You just build it up and come Saturday you can let it all out. Some of the young boys are keen and they do fly in, but sometimes it is better to be pulling players back rather than pushing them forward. \u201cYou just have to keep an edge on it because some guys are on edge from the Monday, wanting to rip guys\u2019 heads off, but there is a lot of experience in the group to ensure we reach the emotional high when we need to.\u201d The 32-year-old was impressed but not surprised by England\u2019s strong start to the season. Like Wales they have won their opening two games, but they have picked up try bonus points to give them a two\u2011point lead in the table. To win the title, Wales will have to achieve a grand slam, with their final matches in Scotland and at home to Ireland while England are at home to Italy and Scotland. \u201cEngland have come out flying, They suffocated Ireland and were tactically very good. I would not say France were outstanding by any stretch of the imagination but England were clinical and, again, tactically spot on. I am not surprised because they have quality across the board and depth. And they are well coached, seeming to know what they are doing, which helps. \u201cWe have started with two wins on the road, but we have been disappointed with certain aspects and know we need to get better. If we don\u2019t and England come down and play as they have been, they will teach us a lesson. We are not panicking and we know what we have to do and we have trained pretty well this week. It is about starting well and getting the crowd going. We are confident.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
