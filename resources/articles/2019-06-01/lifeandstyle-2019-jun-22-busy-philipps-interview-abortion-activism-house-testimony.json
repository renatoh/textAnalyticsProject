But with more and more US states passing extreme anti-abortion measures, she saw it as a responsibility. \u201cThere is power to being vocal about your experiences as a person because whether we like it or not, people lack empathy, they lack the ability to understand someone else\u2019s situation until they\u2019re really faced with it \u2013 until it\u2019s really shown to them,\u201d she tells me over the phone, cutting out to field texts from her husband and make arrangements for her daughter\u2019s hair appointment. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of value in sharing all of our stories and experiences in order to elicit change.\u201d Historically speaking, she has a point. From the socialist-feminist demonstrators who spoke up about ending their pregnancies in 1969 to the 343 French influencers led by Simone de Beauvoir who signed a 1971 manifesto testifying to their abortions, all have helped pave the way to legal abortion. The former Glamour magazine editor Cindi Leive wrote last year about coming of age at a time when abortion stories were part of the public sphere in the 1980s and 1990s, only to see them all but disappear in the mid-aughts. \u201cAs the years passed, so did that urgency; my generation began to feel more secure \u2013 and perhaps less inclined to air our private business,\u201d she wrote in the New York Times. But as women stopped talking about it publicly, the anti-abortion movement gathered steam. By 2014, 90% of American counties had no abortion access, even though one in four women will have an abortion by the age of 45. And now, thanks to the addition of two ultra-conservative supreme court justices picked by Donald Trump, anti-abortion activists have launched a new spate of state laws they hope will lead the court to overturn Roe v Wade, the decision that has protected abortion rights for decades. That\u2019s what led Leive to write publicly about her abortion, and why the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal penned an op-ed last week about her \u201cexcruciating\u201d decision to end a pregnancy. It\u2019s the political context that gave rise to the #ShoutYourAbortion movement in 2015. And it\u2019s why Busy Philipps is talking to me now. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the anti-abortion minority to be really loud and take up the space,\u201d Philipps says. \u201cAnd the truth of the matter is this is a women\u2019s health issue that affects millions and millions of American women, millions and millions and millions of women and people worldwide, and if we want to take control of the narrative we have to be willing to be loud about it. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to be,\u201d she adds. But, having seen the power of celebrity in advancing #MeToo, she wasn\u2019t about to sit this one out. \u201cWomen have held on to a lot of this shame having to do with their bodies and sexuality forever,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that most of us have reached the point where we\u2019re no longer willing to hold on to this to make someone else comfortable or prevent someone else from feeling uncomfortable.\u201d Philipps came up in Hollywood playing supporting roles in Freaks and Geeks and Dawson\u2019s Creek. More recently she played the best friend character in Amy Schumer\u2019s I Feel Pretty. But it turns out she plays no one as well as herself. Her star turn came on Instagram\u2019s stories feature, of all places, where she quickly racked up more than a million followers with video collages inviting people into the pleasures, struggles and banalities of celebrity life. Here, she is lifting weights in pink Spandex, her blond hair swept back. There, she\u2019s posted a poll asking her followers if a new necklace needs to be longer. The appeal of Busy being Busy landed her her own late-night talkshow on the channel E!, a favorable profile in the New Yorker and a book deal on a collection of essays. This Will Only Hurt A Little \u2013 which became an instant bestseller \u2013 is bubbly in tone, laced with plenty of F-bombs, and features Philipps on the cover in pink. But it\u2019s also dark and reads holistically \u2013 rather than in the tiny shreds more typically rendered by the internet \u2013 while providing a fairly devastating critique of masculinity and authority in America. There\u2019s the time her mouth fills with blood after being smacked across the face by her mom. And there\u2019s the trauma of her first sexual experience, how she found penetration painful and told the guy: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop, slamming her against the carpet of his car so hard she would be left with a spine-length scab. \u201cI found a spot on the ceiling of his car and I sort of spun up to it and just focused on that until he shuddered and rolled off me,\u201d she writes. There\u2019s also a story about James Franco taking one of her (relatively few) lines back when she got her breakout role and how, when she persisted in correcting him, the relationship went cold. \u201cHe was not cool to me at all,\u201d she writes, describing how he once lost his temper entirely, throwing her to the ground on set . That this brief anecdote about Franco\u2019s aggression garnered much of the media attention when the book was released didn\u2019t sit well with Philipps. \u201cThe Franco story is used to illustrate a larger point about the way women are treated in this business and in life. There are no \u2018allegations\u2019 and no \u2018accusations\u2019. It\u2019s a story that I have been telling for years,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. He had apologized, she said, and she had accepted. Later she would sum it up: \u201cI\u2019m a woman in this industry who wrote a personal book about my experiences in life and in this industry, then the headlines were all about a man.\u201d At some point you might wonder if it isn\u2019t a coincidence that someone conventionally beautiful \u2013 tall, blonde, honey-skinned \u2013 has such a keen awareness of women\u2019s systematic disempowerment, though presumably her college coursework in women\u2019s studies didn\u2019t hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s a real double-edged sword,\u201d she says of the female body. \u201cI think culturally we have a really tricky relationship with women\u2019s bodies and women\u2019s sexuality and I\u2019m not sure if the origin is religious, puritanical \u2013 if, you know, we\u2019re going back to the Salem witch trials,\u201d she says. But whatever the origins, she adds, \u201cthese are things that exist and permeate the culture and I think part of allowing ourselves to try to free ourselves from that, from that shame, is by talking about our own unique biology and biological functions, starting with periods, breasts and nipples and destigmatizing all women\u2019s healthcare\u201d. This is exactly what feminists have long been famous for: using insights born of personal experience to speak up on the politics of the day. When Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate judiciary committee that she had been sexually assaulted by the now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Philipps posted on Instagram about her own teenage rape, an act she says she didn\u2019t come to identify as rape until years later. \u201cHaving written the story for my book and having it put into the world publicly in the fall I think really prepared me for this moment, because I do think that I went through all of the fear of retaliation when my book was coming out and I had moved through all of those emotions,\u201d she says. The book also chronicled the experience culminating in her abortion at age 15, how little she knew about sex and sexuality, and how the default \u2013 silence \u2013 meant being pressured to submit to penile pleasure. \u201cMy mom was so cool about so much, but she was also raised very Catholic and it wasn\u2019t ever discussed in a real way. We had the where-do-babies-come-from conversation when I was little, but sex was just something that I knew was shameful,\u201d she writes. It was also all about pleasing men. \u201cI derived no pleasure from it really,\u201d she writes of the unprotected sex she had with her then boyfriend. \u201cI was just happy to be that close to him and to give him what I knew he wanted.\u201d Though names were changed in the book, her personal account \u2013 which the Guardian has not independently verified \u2013 offers something that boilerplate political statements cannot: how blurry the lines are around sexual consent, how often young women are coaxed and cajoled into unprotected penetrative sex for men\u2019s satisfaction and how often they shoulder blame and consequences afterwards. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotten yourself into quite a situation, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Philipps recalled the mom of her then boyfriend saying, before launching into a lecture on how she wouldn\u2019t let Philipps \u201cmurder a baby\u201d. Philipps doesn\u2019t write that her life now would have been impossible without the abortion she got at age 15, but she doesn\u2019t have to. When abortion bans started moving through the states this year, Philipps knew she wanted to use her platform to talk about it \u2013 specifically, she wanted to talk about it on her show, which it had recently been announced, was going to be canceled. So she did. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t know a woman who would have an abortion,\u2019\u201d she told viewers on Busy Tonight. \u201cWell, you know me. I had an abortion when I was 15 years old and I\u2019m telling you this because I\u2019m genuinely really scared for women and girls all over this country.\u201d Next she started the viral hashtag #YouKnowMe, encouraging thousands of others to share their abortion stories too. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a public figure, a person, a celebrity or whatever such as I am myself, people do actually know you, or they think they do,\u201d she says. And so this month, Philipps has continued making the most of her famous (and famously accessible) personality, expanding on her personal story in testimony before Congress. \u201cIt was not a decision I made lightly. But I have never for a moment doubted that it was the right decision for me,\u201d Philipps told members of a House judiciary subcommittee earlier this month. \u201cBut so much has changed \u2013 in Arizona and other states \u2013 since then.\u201d She continued: \u201cToday, legally I would have to get parental consent. I would be forced to undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound, to go to a state-mandated in-person counseling, designed solely to shame me into changing my mind, then take a state-mandated 24-hour time-out to make sure I really knew what I wanted. And finally, I would be forced to give the state a reason why. Well, here is mine: my body belongs to me.\u201d So how did it feel to be talking to a bunch of starched-suit lawmakers she had never met before about one of the most personal decisions of her life? How does it feel to be answering questions from a nosy reporter about the experience? Why, in short, would anyone sign up for this hell? \u201cWell, 100% it\u2019s unfair, but our patriarchal society is set up to be unfair to women. So if we\u2019re going to like, finish it, we\u2019re going to have to go through another period of being uncomfortable,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m willing to be uncomfortable to achieve something better and I think most women are used to being uncomfortable because that is the burden that we have long carried in this society and in our own homes and in the world.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one making the sacrifice. Jayapal said last week that she was talking about her abortion, even though \u201cI should not have to\u201d, while Blasey Ford began by saying: \u201cI am here not because I want to be. I am terrified.\u201d The toll of talking about these things is clear and paid upfront, while the benefits are uncertain. But as a mother to two girls, Philipps felt strongly enough about speaking to bring the older one, her 11-year-old, with her on her recent trip to Washington. \u201cI feel a great deal of responsibility in raising daughters in this world that they have a full understanding of the world that they live in and of specifically their own world: what it is to be a woman and what can happen,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething that I wish for them is that they never feel like their basic biology is something that needs to be hidden or is shameful or something they can\u2019t talk about,\u201d she adds. \u201cI think culturally, we are shifting, and I\u2019m happy to be part of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
