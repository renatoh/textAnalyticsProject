And there were no salutes", "bodyText": "\u2022 Since the last edition of his online news bulletin, Aidan Burley MP tells eager subscribers this week, he has attended a photocall at Station Road bridge in Hednesford, visited Rugeley power station to discuss its biomass energy generator project and watched the delivery of a narrowboat to Chancel primary school in Rugeley. No mention, oddly, of having been found by an internal Conservative party inquiry to have been \"stupid\" and \"offensive\" when he bought a Nazi uniform for his friend's stag do. Not a squeak, either, about the subsequent allegations that he lied to that inquiry, after pictures in a Sunday newspaper appeared to contradict his account that he had left the bar when the toasts to Hitler began. Happily, the local Express &amp; Star newspaper reports that Cannock Chase Conservative Association have \"concerns\" about the new allegations and will meet to discuss them this week, in what we are certain will be a full and impartial inquiry. Alas, neither Burley nor councillor Jodie Jones, who chairs the association conducting the inquiry, were available yesterday to elaborate to the Diary. A member of the MP's parliamentary staff did confirm, however, that Jones and Burley are engaged to be married. Which is lovely. \u2022 On which subject, we are cheered to see the spirited letter to the Camden New Journal from one \"Chris Percy, NW3\", in response to the paper's interview with Edward de Mesquita, who runs a crepe stall in Hampstead High Street and now intends to stand as a Conservative councillor. In his interview the stallholder, whose recent dispute with a local pub over the location of his fridge required police mediation, denied Tories were racist, since \"so many of the Conservatives have foreign wives\". \"We have got whatever they have got,\" he added. \"If they [Labour] have a Bangladeshi woman, then we could get a Bangladeshi woman. In fact I met one the other day. She was very bright, and I said: 'You should get into politics and go against Tulip Siddiq [a Labour councillor and the party's local parliamentary candidate].'\" Mesquita later apologised, but in his letter Chris Percy remained \"incredulous\". \"Do Conservatives have foreign husbands as well? Or is the party to which Mr Mesquita is so proud to belong an all-male club?\" We can't disagree with his point. Though we do wonder if this is the same Chris Percy who last year married local Labour parliamentary candidate Tulip Siddiq, and if so, whether that might just warrant a mention. \u2022 The Daily Mail reports comments from New York's new commissioner of citywide services, Stacey Cumberbatch, in which she suggests her ancestors were once slaves in Barbados who were owned by forebears of the Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The actor has acknowledged his family's history of slavery in a number of interviews, notes the paper. But was his five-greats grandfather Abraham Cumberbatch really so bad? It's an important question, and one from which the Mail has not shirked when examining the history of William Prince Ford, the slave owner played by Cumberbatch in the Oscar-nominated film 12 Years a Slave. The movie, noted the paper last week, \"has its critics, who say it ignores the kindness that Ford is known to have displayed towards his slaves\". To them, it continues, Ford was \"the very model of morality\". That's the thing about slavery. It's such an ethical grey area. \u2022 We leave you with the latest breathless instalment from the Diary book of the week, The Last Gangster by cuddly convicted torturer Charlie Richardson. Today's episode sees our hero running into the actor Richard Harris who told him darkly, \"I need you to fix something for me \u2026 It's my friend Princess Margaret.\" The problem, Harris told him, involved a bounder called John Bindon, who was having an affair with the Queen's sister, and was trying to flog \"some pictures\" for an eyewatering sum. Sure enough Richardson, using his habitual charm, does indeed manage to fix it. But what could the princess have seen in such a notorious ne'er-do-well? \"John Bindon had a considerable advantage in life,\" notes our author. \"He had a huge advantage, you might say.\" There's then something about a party trick involving five pint glasses \u2013 \"those large pub mugs with handles\" \u2013 but we should probably leave it there.

The earlier version mixed up the words \"model\" and \"moral\" when it referred to \"the very moral of morality\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
