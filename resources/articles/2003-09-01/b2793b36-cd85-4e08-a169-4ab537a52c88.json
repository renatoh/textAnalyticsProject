He seemed under severe stress. I did not want to cause him distress so I again tried to distract him,\" she said. Her mother telephoned on July 9, when Dr Kelly's anonymity was blown, to say they were leaving home. Her father came to stay with her on Sunday July 13 before testifying to the Commons foreign affairs committee. \"There was a really strong expression on his face that really shocked me, and I was actually quite distressed to see the hurt that I could see in his face,\" she said. Ms Kelly overheard her father on the phone saying that he was \"very depressed\" by the media coverage, and would only read the sports sections of the newspapers. She told the inquiry Dr Kelly had described the FAC inquiry as \"very, very hard\" and had abused one MP who had questioned him: \"He said it very quietly, with some feeling, and that was that this man was an utter bastard.\" He also talked briefly about Gilligan, and said that his feeling was that he had \"accumulated this information over time\" and that he could not understand how he had made such forceful claims from their conversation. As Dr and Mrs Kelly finally headed home from his appearances before the FAC and intelligence select committee, they shared an evening meal with Ms Kelly and her fiance, David Wilkins. She said he appeared more relaxed when she met him at the train station, that the pressure may have lifted a little bit, and though he was quiet during the meal he but \"seemed to be more cheerful and obviously looking forward to going home.\" She arranged to go for a walk with her father the next day to see a newborn foal they had been visiting. It was to be the day that Dr Kelly took his last walk into the woods. Key question Can you describe his expression [when he stayed at her house before appearing before the select committees]? Key answer It was a very long look. It was quite a loving look, if you like. I loved my father very much and, as a daughter, I was very concerned to see him showing me this sort of vulnerable side to him; but his eyes seemed quite sort of dilated and quite sort of liquid, quite deep. It was a really strong expression, but then the moment passed, and I was aware that he seemed very gentle, more childlike. I was very conscious that our roles seemed to be reversing, that I needed to look after him and he needed to be looked after. As I said, the moment passed. I showed Dad up to his room. Then we just tried to relax. I took him out to my garden. I have a small garden and Dad always quite liked it. I showed him all my plants. I was just keen to try to look after him and provide some comfort to him. One thing I remember thinking was that I would never compromise his dignity, and that is probably what prevented me from seeing that he needed perhaps more help than I alone could give him. By that time I knew, from Mum and from Dad, that he would have to face these two committees the coming week. And I think both of us accepted he did not have any choice but to go in front of them. And Dad certainly saw it as his duty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
