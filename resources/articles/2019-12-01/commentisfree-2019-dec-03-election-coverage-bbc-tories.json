The onslaught of lies has become a tsunami in the few weeks since I launched a website to keep track of Johnson\u2019s falsehoods, with dozens more waiting to be added to the list. A particularly distasteful batch concerns his use of the London Bridge terror attack as a campaign tool, in defiance of the wishes of the father of one of the victims. On the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday he wheeled out four or five more, including the daft claim that Jeremy Corbyn will disband MI5, and another that Labour was responsible for the London Bridge attacker\u2019s early release. Marr barely managed to confront these lies, and it\u2019s noteworthy that the BBC only allowed the prime minister on the air because, after the attack, \u201cit was in the public interest\u201d. Johnson continues to dodge an interview with Andrew Neil, who has eviscerated Nicola Sturgeon and Corbyn. Meanwhile, Johnson has scarcely been interrogated about the biggest lie of all. It lurks there in plain sight: the Tory slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d. The nonsensical Conservative position that the country will leave the EU on 31 January \u2013 and that the transition period will end in December 2020 \u2013 has hardly been scrutinised. More bigoted statements emerge from Johnson\u2019s press clippings \u2013 such as his claim in 1995 that the children of single mothers were \u201cill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d. Yet he continues to brush off complaints, as he did, again on The Andrew Marr Show, with his offensive comparison between Muslim women and bank robbers. No previous prime minister or party leader would have survived. But Johnson doesn\u2019t merely survive. He flourishes. How? Partly it\u2019s because he combines membership of the traditional British establishment with celebrity status among the contemporary media elite: Eton, Oxford, the Bullingdon Club, the Conservative party, the Spectator, and flashier parts of the City. He knows what to say and who to say it to. Britain\u2019s three most powerful newspaper groups (the Telegraph, the Murdoch press and Associated Newspapers) fervently support the Conservative party while being dedicated to the destruction of Corbyn. It is particularly striking that the Times, the voice of Britain\u2019s professional class, has been so stridently in favour of Johnson. Yet the written press have always tended to support Conservatives. In this election, though, they have an unusual ally \u2013 the BBC. The British Broadcasting Corporation is bound by rigorous rules of impartiality that do not apply to newspapers \u2013 one reason the organisation has often been unjustly accused by those very same newspapers of being biased towards the left. In the 2019 general election, however, the BBC has been behaving in a way that favours the Tories. After a dishevelled Johnson made a mess of placing a red wreath at the Cenotaph, ahead of the silence on Remembrance Sunday, BBC Breakfast showed footage of a much smarter Johnson placing a green wreath: footage dating back to 2016, when Johnson was foreign secretary. The corporation insisted the clip was used in error. Then there was the rather more serious case when, for its main news broadcast, the BBC edited a clip to cut out the audience laughter at the prime minister during the party leaders\u2019 Question Time, after he was asked whether he believed it was important to tell the truth. The edited clip showed only applause. As Lady Bracknell said: \u201cTo lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose both looks like carelessness.\u201d There has, however, been a series of such misfortunes \u2013 all of them errors, perhaps, but all contributing to the widespread impression that the BBC is putting its thumb on the scale for the government. In October Jill Rutter, a senior research fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe, highlighted the way in which many senior journalists, including the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, had become overly dependent on private briefings from Johnson\u2019s strategy chief, Dominic Cummings. \u201cThis way of operating does the public a big disservice,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cIt allows Downing Street to get its message out without having to take responsibility for it.\u201d When Johnson made his notorious \u201cthere is no press here\u201d claim in front of the cameras at Whipps Cross hospital in east London\u2013 while being quizzed by a father anxious over his sick daughter \u2013 Kuenssberg came to his rescue. Passing over the prime minister\u2019s falsehood at the time, she sent out a tweet stating that the father was a Labour activist. Yet it is unfair to single out Kuenssberg. Research by Justin Schlosberg of Birkbeck, University of London, shows how the BBC (and other TV channels) paid huge attention when the obscure former Labour MP Ian Austin endorsed the Tories. Those channels paid far less attention when Ken Clarke, a political giant, suggested he would not vote Tory. Dr Schlosberg also draws attention to the striking imbalance in the coverage of manifesto launches. The Institute of Fiscal Studies produced an immediate and strongly critical response to both Tory and Labour manifestos, but \u201cthe IFS response to Labour was covered 10 times on the BBC in the two days\u201d compared with \u201cjust one mention\u201d for its criticism of the Tory manifesto in the equivalent period. I don\u2019t think the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, and his senior executives actively support Johnson and his Brexit policy. The problem is more interesting. The BBC does not have a party political bias: it is biased towards the government of the day. Two decades ago Hall was the BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs. Back then the corporation allowed itself to be bullied, manipulated and played by the New Labour government. William Hague\u2019s Tories were almost as hard done-by as Corbyn is today. The memo from the then Newsnight editor Peter Horrocks to his team after the 1997 general election \u2013 calling for a very much different, and softer, analysis of New Labour in power than its Tory predecessor \u2013 remains notorious. The BBC is the second greatest British institution (after the NHS) created during the 20th century. It holds us all together as a nation. It stands for something magnificent about the decency and creativity of the British people. Like other great institutions, including parliament, it has been shaken by Brexit. That is understandable. But I worry that, over the last few months, it has been letting down the people who believe in it. I hope that BBC executives are not favouring the Tories simply because they fear the revenge a Conservative government would take if the corporation gave proper scrutiny to its stunningly dishonest campaign. This wouldn\u2019t work: Johnson has allies who would love nothing more than the destruction of British public service broadcasting. It is past time for the BBC to regain its confidence as a fair-minded news organisation admired and envied across the world. \u2022 Peter Oborne is a journalist and author, and also runs a website about Boris Johnson\u2019s falsehoods"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
