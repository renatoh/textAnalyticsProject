The shadow international development secretary, Alan Duncan, said Labour had falsely presented Tory policy, echoing the allegation the Conservatives made last week regarding health plans. And he accused Labour of obtaining party funds by deception, by painting a false picture of the difference between the parties' policies. Mr Duncan said Labour claims that the Tories would cut aid by \u00a3800m were \"quite simply a lie\". \"For weeks, despite unequivocal figures in our spending plans, Labour continues to peddle the outright lie that we are going to cut spending,\" he said. \"They have even linked this false allegation to an attempt to solicit members and money for themselves by claiming that Labour was the only party that cared about the plight of the poor. To raise party funds on the back of a lie amounts to obtaining money by deception.\" Mr Duncan called for a united front between the parties on international development. \"I want to build the broadest possible cross-party consensus on development policy and then present it as a united British approach that can be implemented effectively by whoever is in government,\" he said. Mr Duncan was speaking at the launch of the Tories' manifesto on international development. The Conservatives pledged to match Labour's spending commitments by increasing the international development budget by \u00a3800m over the next three years and \"working towards meeting\" the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid by 2013. The Conservatives are also promising to spend aid money \"better\", with significant efficiency savings, and to wrest greater control on aid from Brussels. The Tory leader, Michael Howard, also outlined policies on free and fairer trade. A Conservative government would set up an \"advocacy fund\" to help poor countries fight their corner in international negotiations and ensure they are not outgunned in trade disputes, he said. The Conservatives want to press the EU to allow poor countries tariff-free access to UK markets and to push for \"pro-poor\" reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. They will also press the EU to reduce agricultural tariffs and end \"obscene\" export subsidies. They also support the principle of 100% cancellation of debts to multilateral institutions and the International Finance Facility - the cornerstone of Gordon Brown's debt plans. But they accused the chancellor of hyping the idea, which they said would not get off the ground without widespread international support. Mr Howard said: \"I am totally committed to releasing the poorest in the world from the scourge of disease, ignorance and neglect. \"Poverty is not inevitable. When poor people are given the freedom to prosper, they will do so. And our policies are designed to help give them that freedom and that prosperity.\" But Mr Howard said that however effective the Tory aid programme was, it could not solve the problems of world poverty. \"Good governance, free enterprise, free markets and fairer trade - these offer an end to global poverty,\" he said. A Tory government would set demanding requirements for policy and governance as a prerequisite for aid distribution through governments, Mr Howard added. Labour mounted a fierce attack on the Tories even before the document was published. The international development secretary, Hilary Benn, said the Conservatives had no credibility on the issue. \"When they were last in office, the Tories halved Britain's aid budget,\" he said. \"Between 1979 and 1997, the Tories cut the aid budget as a proportion of national wealth from 0.51% to only 0.26%. \"In 1992, their manifesto expressed their commitment to meet the long-term UN target of 0.7% of GNP - but they then proceeded to cut the aid as a percentage of national wealth even further. Why should we trust the Tories to act differently this time?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
