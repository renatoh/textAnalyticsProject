Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three. Catch up with Jon Wilde's episode two blog here As tonight's episode approached, there seemed at least one thing we could be certain of: there was no way the plot could move more slowly than in previous instalments. But against all odds, it did. Had this episode moved any more slowly, in fact, it would have been heading backwards. Hell, it even managed to do that. We opened with Stanley looking for some cheese with which to feed Louis. Louis is wearing a worried look \u2013 and no wonder. As Stanley reminds him once again, he needs to get out of the country without delay. Rewind seven weeks: Christmas is fast approaching and poor Jessie is being wheeled into the operating theatre. Pamela is on hand to deliver this week's first example of clunky dialogue. \"What a shock,\" she says, \"what a dreadful thing to have happened.\" For all the emotion she invests in the line, you'd think someone had spilt a drop of Merlot on her Axminster. Nobody seems too concerned that Jessie is in a coma, least of all the cops who have a few quick words with Louis and then decide that they've got better things to do than investigate the attempted murder of the Prince of Wales's favourite singer. As the press gather at the hospital gates, it's clear that there's nothing to report, as precisely nothing is happening. In the absence of any plot development, Poliakoff offers up yet more lovely, lingering shots up and down corridors. It's all going off at the offices of Musical Express, however. Stanley arrives to discover Eric, the new recruit, is a walking sandwich board for exciting new-fangled technologies such as FM radio and electronic music. The times, Poliakoff makes clear, are clearly a-changin'. Back to the hospital where the dialogue moves stiffly, as though made out of crinkly papier-mache. Lady Cremone helpfully explains that it's not easy to communicate with someone who happens to be unconscious. But she's going to give it her best try: \"Maybe I should get them to bring me an artichoke, Jessie, and start eating it.\" . The conversation turns to the question of how to contact Jessie's family \u2013 although given that, as with other meagrely drawn characters, Jessie lacks a back story, and therefore a family, that particular mission seems doomed from the start. Meanwhile, Pamela needs to tell Julian about Jessie's mishap but cannot reach him in Paris. She comes up with a brainwave, asking Stanley to guess which restaurant her brother will be dining at. Lovebirds Louis and Sarah have had a brainwave of their own. They'll play the band's debut recording at Jessie's bedside in the hope that the sound of her own voice will haul her back to consciousness. No such luck. Time then, for Anthony Head to turn on the bedside charm that he so ably demonstrated in those advertisements for Nescafe Gold Blend. He attempts to rouse Jessie from her coma by reminiscing about the time that she wowed a drunken prince with her off-key vocals. And, by jove, he succeeds. Jessie is awake \u2026 albeit, alas, not for long. Meanwhile Lady Cremone is throwing a party in a cowshed of all places. Unexpectedly Julian arrives, fresh back from his mysterious trip to Paris. Sadly his cunning plan to export English cheeses to France meets with muted enthusiasm. With the episode dangling precariously by its teeth and its eyebrows, you sense that only the arrival of the Nazis can save it. Cue a call from the German embassy asking Stanley to recommend a band to play at a function to mark Hitler's appointment as chancellor. With Louis smuggled on stage in place of the white pianist, the Nazis swarm en masse towards the exit doors. I feared the worst for Louis and chums, but retaliation proves not to be on the cards. Instead, Pamela declares her undying love for Stanley who stands there with a sponge-cake expression plastered to his face. Jessie is dead, says Lady Cremone wearing a pale, embalmed look entirely suited to one who has bad news to impart. Time for Poliakoff to crack one last clunky line of dialogue: \"She was a fine artist, such a fine artist.\" She wasn't. But it's the thought that counts. The music Mercifully perhaps, the music took a back seat this week. At the hotel's Christmas bash, the band, minus Jessie , launched into a chirpy festive number that was rotten even by their standards. But at least it got the dastardly Germans worked up into a lather: \"Fuck 'em,\" said Mel Smith's Schlesinger, although it's unclear whether he was referring to the Nazis or the band. At the New Year's Eve shindig, the firework display \u2013 the highlight of the episode \u2013 is followed by a quick burst of muted trumpets that, for once, bears a vague similarity to jazz as we know it. Again, Ellington it's not. Later, at the party thrown in honour of Hitler, the gathering looks perplexed as Stanley himself leads the all-white band into a lightweight dance number. Maybe their confusion has less to do with the awfulness of the music and more to do with the cute little Nazi flags stuck in the vol-au-vents. Notes and observations \u2022 Christmas brought us a divine shot of Jane Asher eating a buttered sprout. Her former fiance Paul McCartney would undoubtedly approve. \u2022 Crikey Stanley. Kept at room temperature, even the sturdiest of cheddars would not be long for this world. Then there's the mice to consider. \u2022 No mention of the Masonic Lodge this week. Expect the Freemasons to make a sinister comeback in episode four, quite possibly in league with the Nazis. \u2022 Who is that weird-looking woman hovering outside the hospital at all hours? Just in case you missed her in the earlier scenes, the episode closed with a lingering shot of her looking suitably weird. She's up to no good, I'll be bound."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
