Now they've done it again, securing the first ever live show on British soil by the second-most-blogged-about young rapper in America, Danny Brown. With his electric-shock hair and cartoon chuckle, Brown is clearly not your average trap rapper. Rocky recently compared him to Ol' Dirty Bastard, but Brown's craziness is more controlled, with echoes of fellow Detroit native Eminem in the way he litters his sleazy confessionals with savvy pop-cultural humour. Ultimately, though, Brown feels like an entirely new voice, one with a lot to say and plenty of smart ways to say it. He's supported by the regular Livin' Proof DJ tag team of Rags, Budgie, Snips and Khalil, while Cameo and Darq E Freaker offer grimier goings-on in Room Two. XOYO, EC2, Fri Sam Richards The Tuesday Club's Foundry Send-Off, Sheffield When you think of a typical midweek student party, what springs to mind are loud young men and women chugging hard on budget-price alcohol, dancing to the same old dog-eared classics. Not so the students of Sheffield, whose Tuesday Club has, for the last 13 years, been entertaining them and clued-up locals alike with a soundtrack of drum'n'bass, hip-hop and more. People come here to dance. Unfortunately, the Students' Union building is due for a major refurbishment, with some parts being closed until September 2013, so tonight The Tuesday Club bids farewell to its home, though it will announce details soon of its new two-roomed dwelling. Guest DJs for the send-off are typically exciting \u2013 Andy C &amp; GQ, Dj Zinc, Rudimental, Dub Phizix &amp; Strategy and Zed Bias \u2013 as are those planned for the 14th birthday party in October, and a planned Valve Soundsystem show at the O2 Academy. Fusion &amp; Foundry, Sheffield University Students' Union, Sat Marc Rowlands Swedish House Mafia, Milton Keynes Taking the notion of the \"Superstar DJ\" to its logical conclusion, Swedish House Mafia have been a huge ticket draw for years now, and 2012 has seen Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso enter another stratosphere altogether. So it's all the more surprising, then, that this will be their last ever UK show. Instead, the boys intend to concentrate on selling even more records than the million notched up last year. Tonight, they promise to go out in trademark style with a huge, flamboyant show. From the supports, take your pick from the delights of Calvin Harris or Pete Tong, and if you're in early, there's rising electronic star Madeon, proggy Swedish producer Elesso and richly anthemic Dutch house duo, No_ID. The National Bowl, Watling Street, Sat John Mitchell Bestival Presents Wildlife, London As we await the third album from sinuous Oxford indie explorers Foals, the band have issued a stopgap in the form of an excellent mix album. Foals Tapes is a mix of two halves, with the first \"side\" comprising tourbus faves (including tracks by the Invisible, Teengirl Fantasy and 80s South African pop star Condry Ziqub), with the second venturing into the kind of chewy house and disco territory favoured by keyboardist Edwin Congreave when he DJs alongside Friendly Fires' Jack Savidge as Deep Shit. They launch it with a DJ outing at this Bestival warm-up, alongside a live set from tropical synth-rockers the Other Tribe. Bussey Building, SE15, Sat SR The Berkeley Suite Presents, Glasgow Another joint project between The Arches and Berkeley Suite again brings together two of NYC's finest exponents of contemporary disco and house tunage, in the form of all-round nice guy and ex-DFA label manager Justin Miller and Let's Play House promoter and On The Prowl label boss Jacques Renault. Expect a comprehensive round-up of what's currently hot on the floor of Brooklyn's warehouses and Manhattan's ballrooms.
