Saying sorry has become the modern corollary to the previous stiff-upper lip policy of \"never apologise, never explain\". The other Archer - former news correspondent rather than lag - cleverly exploits the notion of what is and is not forgivable in his story of a Japanese car manufacturer who is about to open a new plant in Walsall, giving a huge boost to an ailing motor industry. The industrialist decides to square with his conscience by issuing a formal apology for his treatment of British prisoners of war in Burma. But one ex-prisoner, despite being close to 80 and near death himself, sets out to kill his former torturer. The British security forces are obliged to intervene, less to prevent old men from behaving badly than to save the lucrative economic contract from going belly-up. The flawed Harrison, bent on vengeance, is the book's most interesting character, as a representative of the sort of awkward historical memories that New Labour finds so difficult to erase, those falling outside the heritage racket. Harrison is also reminiscent of Robert Graves, using war damage to excuse subsequent bad behaviour and misogyny. Unfortunately, the hunt for Harrison, and the international drugs-trade sub-plot, are never as compelling as the central ethical issue of justified revenge, or the rather bleak message that age solves nothing. Eureka, by William Diehl (Heinemann, \u00a39.99) Dead body in the bath, the radio in with it: accidental electrocution, it would seem. Of course it's not, and Diehl milks with aplomb the emerging mystery of the corpse's identity, an apparently very ordinary middle-aged woman, a tax-office clerk, living alone in a modest Los Angeles suburb. The year is 1941 and the US is about to enter the war. The corpse turns out to have no history prior to 1924, no family pictures, and an inexplicable fortune in her bank account. Eureka is an example of what distinguishes a thriller from a crime story: scope, for one, and the grey areas of conspiracy. Outside the nugget of its central mystery - done well enough to sustain the story - Eureka turns into a simple moral tale of square-jawed law enforcers, civic red tape and obvious bad guys, and as such offers an efficient, if uninspired, retread of an established formula handled more adventurously in, among others, Chandler's The Big Sleep. The Beach House, by James Patterson and Peter de Jonge (Headline, \u00a310.99) This is like reading Hello! and being allowed to sift through the dirty linen of the houseowners, in this case the filthy rich of Long Island. Patterson and de Jonge pull the same initial stunt as William Diehl: the drowned corpse with the mysteriously large and unexplained bank account. The stiff in question is a law student's kid brother, part of the local community, a genial slacker who did odd jobs for visiting millionaires until washing up dead on a private beach. The Beach House is summer trash reading, vaguely Grisham, an example of how few buttons you need to push to command an international audience. It is a franchise novel with Alzheimer's plotting - constant reminders for those of short attention span. The result is indistinguishable in its way from, say, an episode of Sex and the City, the point being that it could just as easily be something else - a movie treatment or something caught late at night on TV. It could have been written by a machine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
