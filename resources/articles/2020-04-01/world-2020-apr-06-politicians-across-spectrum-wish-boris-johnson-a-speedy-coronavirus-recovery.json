Donald Trump also passed on his nation\u2019s best wishes to the UK leader, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday with continuing Covid-19 symptoms. The US president told his daily coronavirus press conference: \u201cAll Americans are praying for him.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine. I\u2019m sure he is going to be fine. He\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d Labour\u2019s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, both wished Johnson a speedy recovery while the former prime minister Tony Blair, who was hospitalised himself briefly in 2003 to correct an abnormal heart rhythm during his premiership, said Johnson\u2019s hospital situation must be \u201chellish\u201d. Blair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI have every sympathy and solidarity with him. I know it must be a hellish situation to be in.\u201d There were also messages of support from the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the Labour backbencher David Lammy, one of Johnson\u2019s fiercest critics, who said: \u201cThe whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible.\u201d There were also calls for Johnson to reflect on his health and take time out from Downing Street if necessary rather than soldier on. The former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it would be \u201csensible\u201d for Boris Johnson to \u201cstep back\u201d if he was not well enough to carry out his role for now. He told the Today programme: \u201cI think in the end if he\u2019s not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job\u2019s tough at the best of times and it\u2019s doubly tough now.\u201d Michael Gove\u2019s wife, the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, suggested Johnson\u2019s failure to shake off the virus was linked to his commitment to continue leading the nation\u2019s battle against the virus. \u201cBoris has worked non-stop throughout his illness \u2013 and now we see the result,\u201d she tweeted. Asked whether Johnson should hand over control during his illness, Blair said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to second guess them on that. \u201cHe knows the state of his own condition and he will be judging it carefully himself, I\u2019m sure.\u201d A Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister\u2019s admission to hospital had been a precautionary move taken \u201con the advice of his doctor\u201d because he had continued to have \u201cpersistent symptoms\u201d 10 days after testing positive for the virus. Johnson tested positive last month along with Matt Hancock, who has recovered. His chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, also self-isolated. Johnson\u2019s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better. From an apartment above 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government\u2019s response and chaired meetings via video conference. He has posted a series of video messages since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie, but in the latest post on Friday he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d he said.
