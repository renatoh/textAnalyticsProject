The blast, which happened at the Stockline Plastics factory, near the city's Maryhill Road, left up to 30 people injured, three of them seriously, according to initial reports. Emergency workers were trying to rescue another 10 people thought to be trapped under rubble. The cause of the explosion, which resulted in the collapse of large parts of the four-storey building, was not immediately known. Firefighters compared the scene of devastation to the aftermath of an earthquake. Rescue workers were anxious that the building could collapse further, and were trying to stabilise the structure as they attempted to dig people out. Strathclyde police said that 50 people worked in the factory, most of whom had been accounted for. Those trapped were thought to include 10 people believed to have been holding a meeting on one of the upper floors at the time of the blast. Firefighters say they have managed to make contact with several trapped people. Two made contact by mobile phone. Strathclyde firemaster Brian Sweeney said: \"The public will be familiar with earthquake procedures in Turkey and Afghanistan, so what we have here is a scene very similar to that. A great deal of delicate and difficult work has to be done.\" Up to 200 firefighters from around the country were involved in the rescue operation, some of them using thermal imaging cameras and heat-seeking equipment. At least three people had been pulled from the rubble in the last hour, Mr Sweeney said, but he estimated that the operation could take as long as 48 hours. Chief Superintendent David Christie said he could not confirm any fatalities. Eleven people were taken to hospital, and at least 13 others made their own way for treatment. The injured were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the Western Infirmary, Stobhill hospital, and the Southern General hospital. Glasgow Maryhill MSP Patricia Ferguson, who arrived at the scene at around 2.45pm, said: \"There are people unaccounted for, and our thoughts are with them and their families at this worrying time.\" A police spokeswoman was unable to confirm reports that two Royal Navy helicopters were on standby to take more casualties to other hospitals. The area surrounding the factory was sealed off as emergency workers searched the rubble. Members of the public helped ambulance crews to treat survivors in emergency tents set up at the scene. One woman who had been shopping in a nearby store at the time of the blast spoke of the \"horrific\" scene\". \"I could hear people screaming, and there were people running about covered in blood. There were people buried in the rubble, they were screaming for help - it was horrific,\" she said. Gerry McGuinness, 44, a technician who had been working at a dental surgery, rushed to the scene immediately after the explosion. He said: \"It nearly shook me off my seat. We ran up and started taking some of the bricks away. There were four guys and one girl trapped under the rubble. We couldn't see them, but they were screaming at us to help them.\" Relatives of those working at the factory were meeting at community central hall, on Maryhill Road, to wait for information. Gary Gentels, the hall's facilities manager, said: \"Everyone who's coming in is very shocked. It is a very close-knit community, and this will hit pretty hard.\" A spokeswoman for Transco said that the gas supply to the factory had been switched off, but had not been a factor in the explosion. \"We have been able to rule out the gas mains or the gas supply being related to the incident at all,\" she said. \"But we can't say whether they were using gas or LPG [commercial propane or butane] internally.\" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) confirmed that a principal inspector had arrived at the scene to determine whether it would investigate. \"It is too early to know whether or not we will be required to carry out an investigation, and no inquiry would take place until the police have concluded work at the site,\" an HSE spokesman said. \"The accident will come under our jurisdiction if the incident involved working practices, a gas explosion or chemicals stored on the site.\" A spokeswoman for the Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, said he was being kept up to date with the situation. An emergency information line has been set up on 0870 050 1999."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
