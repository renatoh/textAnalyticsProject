Thinking things through in depth, my time is up,\u201d Higua\u00edn said in an interview with Fox Sports. \u201cTo the delight of many people, now I will only look at it from the outside. I have spoken to [the manager, Lionel] Scaloni and told him my point of view.\u201d The 31-year-old scored 31 goals in 75 Argentina appearances, with his last appearance coming in the 2-1 win over Nigeria in last year\u2019s World Cup. Higua\u00edn started that game but was dropped for the last-16 defeat to France, and has arguably been made the scapegoat for Argentina\u2019s recent underachievement on the international stage. Higua\u00edn, who has scored three goals in 10 games since joining Chelsea on loan from Juventus in January, added that he has taken the decision in order to focus on club football and spend more time with his family. \u201cI\u2019ve made the decision because I want to enjoy my family, I want to spend time with my daughter, and at the same time, I feel that I gave my country everything I could. \u201cI\u2019m fully focused on my commitment to Chelsea,\u201d the forward added. \u201cThe Premier League is amazing and I really want to enjoy it. It\u2019s very competitive indeed.\u201d Higua\u00edn opted to play for Argentina over France, the country of his birth, and made his debut in the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. He scored four goals in South Africa, but later gained a reputation for expensive misses, failing to score in the 2014 World Cup final defeat to Germany and the consecutive Copa Am\u00e9rica final losses to Chile in 2015 and 2016. \u201cPeople remember the goals I missed and not the ones I scored. I\u2019m sure everyone celebrated the goal against Belgium,\u201d he said, referencing his only other World Cup goal in the 2014 quarter-final. \u201cWhen you criticise someone maliciously, it hurts everyone,\u201d Higua\u00edn added. \u201cI saw how much my family suffered, but I gave everything for the national team. It\u2019s one thing to say that we did not achieve our objectives, but when people talk about failure it\u2019s very hard.\u201d Higua\u00edn\u2019s retirement comes less than a week after Lionel Messi returned from his post-World Cup international hiatus, featuring for Argentina in the friendly defeat against Venezuela in Madrid last Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
