It was the early 1990s and Al Murray and I were at a BBC light entertainment Christmas party, piling into the cheap wine, when we spotted him across the room. Who knows why he was there, but we were completely starstruck because for our generation, who had grown up on the genius of the Pink Panther films, he was a star. I don\u2019t think I even knew he was called Burt back then, I just saw him as Cato \u2013 the man who jumped on Peter Sellers. Of course, the first thing we did was approach him and ask about Peter, but the thing about Burt is that he always kept his cards very close to his chest, particularly when it came to Sellers. Of all the people that worked with Sellers, Burt never wrote a book. He would never be indiscreet and he told me he stayed away from the funeral because he thought it was going to be a circus. In fact, it was only a couple of weeks ago when I went to see him for the last time, that he finally gave me the closest to an opinion on what Peter Sellers was really like \u2013 simply: \u201cSome days I liked him, some days I didn\u2019t like him\u201d. Which probably tells you all you need to know. He was a man of few words, but they were always very well chosen. For all his experience, you\u2019d have to really draw it out of him if you wanted an anecdote. I might have known him through radio and TV but primarily Burt\u2019s first love was movies and I think he was happiest when he was on a movie set. I think he always saw TV as slumming it a bit and I think he probably wished he could have kept making them like he was back in the 60s; he was making four to five movies a year and loved the life. And he really did work with so many of the greats \u2013 I remember inviting him to a show at the Palace Theatre in the West End and he turned to me and said: \u201cThe last time I was here I was in Mame, with Ginger Rogers, in 1969\u201d. Though if films were his first love, smoking was his second and he smoked up till the end. The person who did costumes on my show used to sew secret pockets into his costume \u2013 one for his cigarettes and one for his lighter \u2013 and he told me his GP would bring him 200 duty free when he went on holiday. I was always amazed he agreed to be a regular on my show, and I don\u2019t think me or Al Murray or Stewart Lee who were all working on the show back then ever stopped being impressed that he was there, on set. But though he was a great stooge and always the most professional and prepared person on set, he made it clear he didn\u2019t know why most of the parts I gave him were funny. He would willingly dress up as one of the Chemical Brothers or the Proclaimers without any idea who they were. And when I once asked him what martial art he had learned for the role of Cato in The Pink Panther he just said: \u201cI don\u2019t know any martial arts, I always just made it up\u201d. I loved how dry Burt\u2019s humour was. In particular he loved to joke about the cliched roles he took on as a Chinese actor, particularly in the 60s when he was one of the only Chinese actors in the business. I remember him telling us how he\u2019d played Japanese commandants and soldiers, Chinese soldiers, even Koreans. \u201cYou know Harry, I sometimes wonder if the second world war was fought just to keep me in work!\u201d he\u2019d say. Even in the early 2000s, when I asked him about a new film he was in, he told me: \u201cOh it\u2019s just the usual. I\u2019m an old Chinese guy who runs a laundry and gets machine-gunned in the first 10 minutes.\u201d He remained wry to the end. We always remained in touch, even after we stopped filming together, and it was six months ago that I phoned him up. We had a running joke that my calls were only to check if he was still alive, but this time his response was: \u201cWell, Harry I\u2019ve got cancer, so you need to get a better punchline to your joke.\u201d I\u2019ve spent the last few months seeing a lot of him, which I am really glad about. He even told Barry Cryer and me to arrange a memorial service for him, which would be filled with laughter and have The Slow Boat to China as the music. We asked \u201cWhat about the Pink Panther tune?\u201d, but he just said: \u201cOh, they\u2019ll play that anyway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
