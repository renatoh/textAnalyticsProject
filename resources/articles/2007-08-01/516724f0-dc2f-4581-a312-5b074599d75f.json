The 26-year-old Honda rider brushed aside opposition from his championship rivals Troy Bayliss and Noriyuki Haga, and celebrated a 66-point lead in the series by hurling his leathers into the crowd on the front straight when he completed his victory lap. \"I've been riding superbikes for seven years here, and I don't know what I've been playing at,\" Toseland said. \"I would have put all my wages down to get this here. I'm very emotional.\" Toseland, who first won the superbike title in 2004, now has only three more rounds to go before he starts a new career in 2008 on a Yamaha in the MotoGP series, motorcycling's equivalent of formula one. He started the day with a 43-point lead, but wanted to stretch that to at least 50 to avoid the need for risky tussles in the final races. And he achieved his ambition by bustling aside Troy Bayliss (Ducati) on lap three of the first of the two 25-lap legs, and racing on to a 1.5 sec victory over the Australian Troy Corser (Yamaha). Bayliss effectively ended his championship bid when he slid off after being passed by Haga (Yamaha). The Italian Max Biaggi, however, maintained pressure on Toseland by finishing third on his Suzuki. \"It's not scary, but it has so many blind corners and ups and downs,\" he said. \"It's the most difficult track I have raced on.\" Bayliss again started first in the second leg, but this time he lasted only a lap before Toseland blasted past him. At one stage, Haga pushed to the front, but Toseland responded and held on for his eighth victory of the year. He now has 355 points to the 289 of Haga and Biaggi's 286 and can afford to accept second place in some remaining races rather than risk crashing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
