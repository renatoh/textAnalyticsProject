The No2 seeds and last year's finalists faced Brazilian Andrew Sa and Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty in a rain-interrupted match on court five. But Knowles, who had to retire from his first-round qualifying singles match with the left knee injury, had stepped out on court with industrial-strength strapping from the top of his thigh to mid-calf and his mobility was undoubtedly affected. In particular his serve seemed under pressure. At 3-0, 30-0 he hammered two double faults into the net and his play from the back of the court seemed restricted. But what Knowles lost in mobility, he made up for in reaction with his net play as sharp as ever. The pair's domination of the net and spinning volleys into the furthest corners of the tram lines outwitted their opponents and they took the match 6-3, 7-6, 7-5. Silvia Farina Elia's improved her best performance at Wimbledon by advancing yet again, this time at the expense of the unheralded Paola Suarez of Argentina, 7-5, 7-6. The unseeded Suarez, making her ninth appearance at Wimbledon, turned 27 on the opening day of and has been celebrating since by reaching the fourth round to equal her best run at the Championships. She upset the 12th seed, Magdalena Maleeva in the second round but was unable to recreate that form when she faced the 27th seeded Italian, with Farina Elia quick to pounce on the errors which crept into the Suarez game towards the end of the first set. Farina Elia took command when she broke to lead 6-5 and then claimed the opening set to break Suarez twice more to lead 4-1 in the second. But the Argentinian recovered her poise and scrambled her way back into contention with some excellent retrieving to pull level only to lose her way again when serving for 6-5 by dropping serve and handing her 31 year-old opponent from Rome the chance to claim the match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
