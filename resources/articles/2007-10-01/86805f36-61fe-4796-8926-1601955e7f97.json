For that, some might read depressing and harrowing. She herself told Radio 4's Today: \"When people pick up a book they may want something happy that will cheer them up. In that case they shouldn't really pick up my book. It's the intellectual equivalent of a Hollywood weepie\". An emotional Enright, speaking at the ceremony at the Guildhall, London, last night, thanked the \"love of my life\" Martin Murphy, artistic director of the Pavilion Theatre, D\u00fan Laoghaire. She also thanked novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, \"who always said my ship would come in\". She dropped into Gaelic to say she was delighted to accept the prize \"on behalf of the Irish team\". Asked what she would do with the \u00a352,500 prize money, she said \"I bought a dress yesterday, and I am really glad I can afford it today.\" She felt mature enough to take the prize in her stride: \"I'm no spring chicken; and this won't stop me squawking.\" Howard Davies, chair of the judges, described The Gathering as \"an unflinching look at a grieving family in tough and striking language\". He added: \"It's accessible. It's somewhat bitter - but it's perfectly accessible. People will be pretty excited by it when they read it.\" Mr Davies called the judging process \"tight\". They were \"a congenial group of people\" but not necessarily one from whom consensus easily flowed. Accordingly, as befitted the director of the London School of Economics, he devised what he called an ingenious selection of voting schemes: a weighted system, a simple ranking system and single transferable vote. Each voting system confirmed Enright as, on balance, the winner. The Gathering is narrated by Veronica as she prepares for the funeral of Liam, one of her many larger-than-life, unruly siblings. The novel casts back down the generations as Veronica, apparently leading successful life as a well-off wife and mother, attempts to make sense of her clan's turbulent history. Last night Enright said: \"All families are the same - I just multiply them by three for effect. There's always a drunk, always someone who has been interfered with as a child, always someone who's a colossal success.\" A Dubliner, and the second Irish writer in three years to win after John Banville in 2005, Enright studied philosophy at Trinity College before working for broadcaster RTE as a producer. These were stressful years and Enright struggled with depression: \"I heartily recommend having a breakdown young. Because then you make your decisions and get on with it.\" She left her job and began to write; first a well-received collection of stories called The Portable Virgin, then three novels and a work of non-fiction, Making Babies: Stumbling into Motherhood, published in 2004. Ian McEwan may not have won the prize but can take comfort from his healthy sales. On Chesil Beach is far outselling all other short-listed books put together (not to mention the surge of sales for Atonement in the wake of Joe Wright's film). Sales figures of the other books, by contrast, exemplify the tough climate for literary fiction in the marketplace; Enright's book has so far shifted just 3,253 copies. The latest figures from Nielsen BookScan show that the McEwan has sold a total of 120,362; Nicola Barker's Darkmans, 11,097; Lloyd Jones's Master Pip, 5,170; Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist 4,425, and Indra Sinha's Animal's People 2,589. Just after the long list was announced, in mid-August, the figures were even leaner. The McEwan (published in April) had sold 99,660 copies, Hamid (March) 1,519, Jones 880, Enright (May) 834, Barker (May) 499, and Sinha (March) a mere 231. This year's judges, chaired by Davies, are poet Wendy Cope, Giles Foden, biographer and critic Ruth Scurr, and actor Imogen Stubbs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
