The UK's third biggest supermarket yesterday unveiled a better-than-expected 6.6% improvement in like-for-like second quarter sales - the retailer's seventh consecutive quarter of sales growth. Chief executive Justin King said his recovery plan was ahead of target and that while sales had received a boost from warm summer weather and the World Cup, they were being driven by consumers demanding better quality food. \"There is an increasing trend to fresh and healthy food,\" he said. \"We are in the middle of a sea-change in customers' attitude towards quality.\" Last week rival Tesco said sales of organic products were up 30% over the past year and Asda is promising a range of 1,000 new organic lines as it tries to move upmarket. Sainsbury claims 30% of the UK market for organic food, which it says is clearly entering the mainstream. It now has 430 own-brand organic lines and around 15% of the milk it sells is organic. The huge increase in demand for organic food has prompted concerns that producers are under pressure to lower their standards to meet supermarkets' orders. Mr King said he would rather import organic food than let UK standards slip. Sainsbury has relaunched its premium Taste the Difference range, with no artificial flavourings or colourings, no hydrogenated fats and using only free-range eggs and UK-sourced meat. It also reported a return to rising prices - with inflation running at around 1% - after two years of price deflation. However, Mr King insisted that price competition between supermarkets was not coming to an end: \"The era of price cutting is not over and never will be. There may be some inflation out there, but competition is as tough as ever.\" The chain's two fastest growing lines, he pointed out, are its Basics and Taste the Difference ranges - representing both ends of the price spectrum. And sales of foods highlighted in the chain's TV advertising campaign, fronted by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, have risen dramatically. The Sainsbury's chief executive said the chain was expecting a buoyant Christmas trading period: \"We are well set and have good momentum. We enter the period with confidence.\" However, he said energy costs would rise by \u00a355m in the second half and suggested it would be difficult to keep up the current sales momentum as the store was now coming up against tougher comparables. Third quarter sales last year rose by 5%. Mr King said Sainsbury was on track to meet his three-year recovery target, set in 2005, of increasing sales by \u00a32.5bn a year. \"We are now more than halfway towards that,\" he said. The chain was also ahead of schedule in meeting a target of generating \u00a3700m of additional non-food sales. The group is extending its non-food ranges into 31 more stores, but Mr King said food was still his priority because \"people are unlikely to choose Sainsbury's first and foremost for non-food\". The shares lost ground, closing down 7p at 384p, as analysts voiced concerns about the longer term outlook. The shares are currently trading on a multiple of some 26 times 2007 earnings, which Jeremy Batstone of Charles Stanley described as \"very aggressive\". He added: \"The rating looks too punchy, no matter how solid pre-Christmas trading is,\" and is urging investors to sell. Cazenove also urged caution: \"We would not chase the shares materially higher than the current level.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
