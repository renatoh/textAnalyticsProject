That said, I did have some sympathy for the impossible position that the Trojan royal family found themselves in. There they all are enjoying their economic power and superior trade routes and now, simply because in a moment of sentimentality they chose to embrace their long-lost son, they find themselves with a vengeful Greek army camped outside their walls and their economic supremacy under threat. Small wonder that the eminently sensible Andromache appears particularly unimpressed by the arrival of Paris and his Spartan queen. And what of our central couple? I think perhaps that the main problem I have with Troy is that for this show to work you really have to buy into the great, and destructive, love between Paris and Helen. If you don\u2019t think that this is something worth seeing a city burn for, then the whole show starts to wobble, and the problem is that Bella Dayne and Louis Hunter have next-to-no chemistry. They often come across like a bored couple half-heartedly flirting with each other at the end of the annual sales conference after every other potential prospect has fled home in relief. The Greeks What saved the episode was the arrival of the Greeks, in particular Joseph Mawle\u2019s pragmatic and mournful Odysseus and Johnny Harris\u2019s raging Agamemnon. While I have quibbles about the handling of the sacrifice of Iphigenia \u2013 it would have resonated considerably more if it hadn\u2019t happened within the first 20 minutes of the episode when we\u2019d barely met any of those involved \u2013 Harris did an excellent job of selling Agamemnon\u2019s torment. It was a moment that effectively severed him from his conscience: there is nothing now that he will not do. Notably Odysseus was quick to grasp this divide, between the Agamemnon of the opening scenes and the king of the episode\u2019s end, as his tense demeanour in the negotiating scene demonstrated. Odysseus might not entirely support all Agamemnon\u2019s actions, but he understands that a line has been drawn in blood. Only complete commitment to the coming war is now acceptable yet everyone who partakes in this war, on both sides, will almost certainly pay a terrible price. The Gods One of the things I do really like about this show is its treatment of the Gods. They are truly otherworldly beings, they are not easily placated and can not simply be bought off with a passing dove. Instead they feed on sacrifice, violence and blood as this episode made horribly clear. Even Zeus\u2019s neutrality is a cold act. He remains apart from the fray precisely because it means so little to him: this is a quarrel between Goddesses and, for now at least, he will not sully his hands by getting involved. Additional offerings I really liked the moment when Athena, Hera and Aphrodite walked among the soldiers, calling their names and blessing them. It hinted at a darker, more interesting drama and one that could have genuine power. He\u2019s thoroughly peevish and more than a bit ridiculous but I continue to enjoy Jonas Armstrong\u2019s portrayal of Menelaus. I still can\u2019t warm to Bella Dayne, who undersold Helen\u2019s big \u2018I am woman. Hear me talk\u2019 speech quite considerably. By contrast Chloe Pirrie is doing a nice job as Andromache and I\u2019m interested in Frances O\u2019Connor\u2019s Hecuba. \u201cI should have seen that while the king of Sparta was burying his father your new son would try and sleep with his wife\u201d \u2013 Oh, Pandarus, your sarcasm in the face of daft questions makes you the most relatable person on this show. Worrying omen of the week We all learnt a brutal lesson this week, and that lesson is never forget the rituals even if you are in an epic snit because your wife has smuggled herself away in an ornamental chest. Poor, poor Iphigenia, the one truly innocent victim in all this. Epic declaration of the week Were I a romantic, then I would give this to Paris\u2019s achingly sincere declaration at the end of the episode, but alas I am a sucker for a cheesy line and thus this can only go to Menelaus\u2019s announcement that the Greek army would \u201cbring the rage of the Gods down on your Asiatic heads\u201d, which at least made me laugh in disbelief. So what did you think? Did the second episode improve on the first? Were you moved by poor Iphigenia\u2019s fate?
