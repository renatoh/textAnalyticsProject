Her book and series Living with the Enemy is one of the most important works on the subject. She launched a campaign in 2014 called I Am Unbeatable, which features women who have left their abusers. In 1981, Ferrato was commissioned by Playboy magazine in Japan to document the supposedly hedonistic lifestyle of Elisabeth and Bengt, a couple of New Jersey swingers. Ferrato\u2019s pictures told a different story \u2013 the most famous of which, below, is included in Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential images of all time. Here, she tells the stories behind some of the most potent images in the collection. Bengt Hits Elisabeth, 1982 \u201cThis is the moment that changed my life. It changed Elisabeth\u2019s life. I don\u2019t know what it did to her husband \u2013 I don\u2019t think he cared at all. But for the two of us women, it changed our lives. I\u2019d never seen a woman being hit; I didn\u2019t grow up with violence. I didn\u2019t know he would ever hit her,\u201d Ferrato said. \u201cLate that night, I heard her screaming. I picked up my camera and went running to the bathroom. This was the very first picture I took in that room. When he went to hit her again, I grabbed his arm and said: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 He said: \u2018I\u2019m just disciplining her because she is my wife and she is lying to me\u2019. \u201cPhilip Jones Griffiths, my then partner and president of Magnum photos, said: \u2018Donna, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, just keep doing it. Keep going.\u2019 \u201cI continued to spend time with them. He never hit her in front of me again. She became strong and got him out of her life after one more near-fatal incident.\u201d Six-year-old child Diamond shouts at his father as the police arrest him for domestic violence, Minneapolis, 1986 \u201cPeople are always very shocked by this. You don\u2019t see that many pictures that have this level of real content to them: the boy is saying: \u2018I hate you for hitting my mother, and don\u2019t you ever come back to this house.\u2019 Even the cops had never seen that. And I\u2019d never seen a child stand up to his abusive father. That blew my mind. The mom hadn\u2019t called the cops \u2013 the boy called the cops. He had just shown the police where his father had hidden the screwdriver. \u201cIt was pitch dark at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, I was bouncing the flash off the ceiling \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know how to bounce flash, but I was experimenting. That\u2019s shooting in the dark \u2013 that\u2019s like Jedi shooting!\u201d Soldier getting ready for guard duty during the Gulf war, Hafar al-Batin, Saudi Arabia, 1991 \u201cI went to Saudi Arabia to document women who were fighters, soldiers. She was cleaning her gun before going on duty that night. She\u2019s doing her job. But this caption is my opinion \u2013 that it\u2019s every woman\u2019s right to serve, protect and kill. Because if we don\u2019t, we end up dead from a lot of these men.\u201d Donna Ferrato\u2019s parents, Virginia, 1994 \u201cDad wasn\u2019t physically violent but he was bipolar, he was unfaithful, he was chaotic, he was all over the place, and my mom did not know how to handle this. \u201cFor me, this is an important picture. I didn\u2019t grow up seeing him beat her, but over the years I saw how he manipulated her, how he abused her psychologically. That\u2019s what this represents \u2013 how a man can really abuse a woman, not physically, but psychologically and emotionally bringing her down. \u201cShe gave him everything, and he didn\u2019t value it.\u201d Millie Bianco, New Orleans, 1999 \u201cThis is a very important picture. I was at a domestic violence conference and all of a sudden I saw this woman, Millie Bianco, with a picture of her daughter, Lisa Bianco. Lisa was a very badly beaten woman. She took out a protection order and filed charges against her husband. He went to prison because the abuse was horrific. But he was always saying: \u2018When l get out, I\u2019m going to kill that fucking bitch. She put me in here; I\u2019m going to kill her.\u2019 \u201cOne day, the prison gave him a day furlough, with a car, to supposedly go and see his mother. Instead, he went to Lisa\u2019s house. She had a beeper that would tell her when he came close, because he had to have a tag on his ankle. She was in the shower, the beeper went off, she went running out into the street naked. He was there with a sawn-off shotgun, and he beat her to death. \u201cHe got the death penalty and was executed, but for the mother, that\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s like, the system let him kill her.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day march, Madrid, 2019 \u201cThis was exhilarating. It just feels so good when you\u2019re being carried away by a sea of women who are fed up and not going to take it any more. They\u2019re chanting and they\u2019re laughing and singing and feeling safe in the streets. It\u2019s hard for women to feel safe now. Wherever we go we can get beaten, raped. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re walking with a target on our backs when we go out alone.\u201d Taryn Booker practising a spiritual ceremony called praise flagging, East Hampton, New York, 2011 \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible walking miracle \u2013 what she\u2019s survived, from three different men, terrible abuse, and from her early years: a lot of sexual abuse. She never knew her real value. Whenever she was in a relationship with an abuser, she\u2019d be in and out of shelters. I met her in a shelter in the Hamptons and she told me she\u2019d never go back to him, but she did. And the last time she left him, he almost killed her. \u201cShe said she\u2019d never get involved with another abuser again. Then she got involved with another guy and everything seemed so perfect in the beginning, and you see, he gave her two broken legs and nearly choked her to death. Now she says she\u2019s done with men, she\u2019s really done, she\u2019s focusing on her daughter. She\u2019s focusing on life, she\u2019s working hard. I can only hope and pray, because I think the next man she\u2019s with will kill her. \u201cAnd she\u2019s such a powerful woman \u2013 she\u2019s writing books, she\u2019s very generous, loving, kind.\u201d Self-portrait, Ohio, 1976-2018 \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the portrait in the closet that changed because he led a dissolute life? When I was about 27 and divorced, it was time for me to go out in the world. I felt like I needed to commemorate that moment with a self-portrait. So I turned myself into an old woman, because I knew that people didn\u2019t respect young women, and took some pictures. I didn\u2019t really look at them for 20 or 30 years. \u201cBut finally, when I looked at the film, on this frame only, the bolts are coming right out of my head. That\u2019s weird. \u201cThat\u2019s power \u2013 post-menopausal power, coming out! Because we get a lot more powerful as we get older!\u201d The Living with the Enemy series is included in the book Holy, published by powerHouse Books in the autumn. Ferrato\u2019s work is currently on display at two exhibitions in Madrid as part of PhotoEspa\u00f1a"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
