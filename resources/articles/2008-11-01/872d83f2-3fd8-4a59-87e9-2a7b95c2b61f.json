In total, almost 4,000 posts are being cut from their global workforces, including about 600 in the UK. In addition, French car manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroen is cutting 2,700 jobs worldwide, although that is unlikely to effect British jobs. The company closed its remaining UK plant in Coventry two years ago with the loss of 2,300 jobs. Executives at ArjoWiggins began talks with workers over the future of the Dartford Paper Mill in Kent, which employs 127 people. The biggest cutbacks are coming at engine-maker Rolls-Royce, which plans to make up to 2,000 workers redundant in response to the economic slowdown and delays to some of its most lucrative contracts. It will axe \"around 1,500 to 2,000\" jobs from its 39,000-strong global workforce, or 4% of employees, including 140 cuts next year at its assembly and test facility in Derby. The reductions are in addition to the programme of 2,300 job losses the company announced in January, which is now nearly complete. Following the latest rounds of redundancies, the group will have reduced its workforce by about 10%. Rolls-Royce is consulting with employee representatives about the job losses in Derby, its UK home for 100 years. It blamed delays on individual programmes, including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787, for the cuts but also warned \"economic uncertainties\" meant it had to reduce its cost base. The chief executive, Sir John Rose, said: \"We are determined to maintain our focus on cost reduction and competitiveness as the world economy enters a challenging period. It is too early to determine the precise effects of the global economic downturn and programme delays. However, we wanted to give all our employees an early indication of the likely scale of the job reductions we expect in 2009.\" The manufacturing union, Unite, described the news as \"bitterly disappointing\" and indicated it would fight any compulsory cuts, adding that the company risked being poorly prepared for a recovery when it came. Unite's national officer Bernie Hamilton said: \"Rolls-Royce must take a measured approach to this temporary downturn in the airline industry. In the past, the company has cut too many jobs and Rolls-Royce struggled to meet the upturn in the market. \"If there are to be redundancies in the UK, they must be voluntary. Unite will not accept any compulsory redundancies. Unite is urging the government to use the pre-budget report to support UK manufacturing and encourage companies to retain workers so a skill shortage is not the outcome when market conditions improve. We have a world-class aerospace industry. We must retain these highly skilled jobs at all costs.\" The company said it hoped to keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum by laying off temporary staff and by not replacing staff who retire. Rolls-Royce said it was too early to say where the axe would fall. It has staff in more than 50 countries, although 60% of its workforce - about 22,100 people - are in the UK. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca announced 1,400 job cuts today with the closure of three sites in Spain, Belgium and Sweden by 2013. That is expected to lead to about 250 job losses over the next five years at its plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where 3,000 people are employed. Separately, the company said it was investing in its manufacturing and packaging plant in China. Defence company BAE is to axe 200 jobs in the UK, citing cuts in goverment spending on the armed forces. It said the Minsitry of Defence was spending less on its armoured fighting vehicles programme, leading to job losses in its land system business which will affect plants at Newcastle, Leeds, Barrow, Telford and Leicester. The company has launched a voluntary redundancy programme. PSA Peugeot Citroen said it was cutting jobs from its workforce of 200,000 in response to falling European car sales, which it said have plummeted by 17% since July. It warned that \"this recession will continue in 2009\" and predicted car sales in Europe would be down by at least 10% this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
