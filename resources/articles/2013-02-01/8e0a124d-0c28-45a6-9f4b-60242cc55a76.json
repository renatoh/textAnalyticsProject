Don't read on if you haven't seen the first two episodes \u2013 and please do not leave spoilers if you've seen further in the series. Good day Spiral fans, and welcome to our episode blog for series four, currently airing on BBC4. For the uninitiated \u2013 or those who had momentarily forgotten Spiral's penchant for grittiness \u2013 the opening minutes provided the necessary jolt into the world of Engrenages, in which the murders tend to be messy, the lines blurred, and the colour palate almost relentlessly grey, the radiant Ms Karlsson excepted. Even as a long-standing fan, it took me a few moments to get up to date after a year away: James Donaghy's sterling season three blog is well worth a read if you found yourself struggling to remember the exact circumstances of Laure's shooting incident \u2013 because, let's be honest, not even the police themselves seem completely on top of it. But this new season has started extremely well, already filled with nuance and interesting questions as to when and what behaviours become acceptable in the name of justice, and how they can be abused. All that's missing is Roban. (Of who, more below). Given the overlapping threads that have already been satisfyingly entangled, it seems most sensible to approach the episodes from the three viewpoints below. I haven't seen any further in the series than you \u2013 so we may have to revise that as the show progresses. Do also jump in with any subtitling thoughts you might have. My (lamentable) French isn't good enough to pick up the subtleties, but any insights are appreciated. Les flics A clever opening, as my first thought was that Laure had weathered the storms presented by her shooting of the Butcher of La Villette, and had returned to her position. What was I thinking? Of course she hadn't \u2013 this is Spiral, after all. Her version of events to PJ, handled very nicely, I must admit, didn't quite match mine. Did she really shoot him through fear? Or to ensure \"justice\"? (A theme that is of course explored further through the anarchists' actions). Still, I'd warrant she's done enough to get off the hook with all her talk of respect. And for once, les blunders, while pinned on Laure in her absence, were not actually the captain's fault: it was new Commissioner Herville who thought that sending the guy from finance to trail Sophie would be a good idea, presuming she wouldn't dump her mobile. A bad call \u2013 and a very odd man. When Laure noted: \"People, we're in trouble,\" I fear she wasn't much wrong. People, of course, meaning the old gang of Laure, Gilou and Tintin, who as ever, found himself digging the trio out of trouble this week thanks to the last-minute wire tap. Poor guy \u2013 and with twins coming too. Gilou, meanwhile, seems hellbent on getting himself into a whole load of trouble with the Sarahouis, under investigation for people trafficking and immoral earnings and keen to have their licence extended. It may well be that only crooks can give you decent information \u2013 but I fear this will not end well, not least because Nabil appears to be less than trustworthy. On the plus side: Gilou's neither taken a load of cocaine nor shagged a prostitute so far \u2013 although he did totally try it on with Amina. So progress of a sort. Berthaud and Br\u00e9mont hardly got off to the best of starts \u2013 lots of questions about motives with this pair \u2013 but are apparently very much still an item. Not only did Br\u00e9mont save Laure's neck with Judge Wagner, but talking in the pub, he placed her above police work in terms of importance. Can't say I think she'd do the same for him, necessarily. Les r\u00e9volutionnaires If series three went a bit whodunnit, this fourth season of Spiral promises to provoke some interesting social discussion. And so we have a focus on immigration and a deportation system that appears to be indiscriminately sending people back to a certain death (Erkan), or detaining those who have a legitimate claim to be citizens (Moussa Kon\u00e9, seemingly). It's notable that the officers here are shown to be considerate, polite people doing their jobs \u2013 and comment is aimed squarely at the system. Although not everybody is so bothered by the distinction between the two. Thomas and Sophie, for instance, appear to be part of an anarchist collective, splitting swiftly into two cells: the moderates trying to avoid violence led by Christophe, and the hardliners who believe that violence can be defensible in the context of their fight. Hugo died (on his own, in terrible pain) after making bombs from sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, which were meant to be used in a forthcoming attack to destroy a computer server that contains residence applications. The result will be that no deportations can be processed for six months: the cost could be the lives of innocents such as cleaners who get in the way of the attack. The point that Thomas cares little for individuals \u2013 particularly, it seems, those affected by the systems he's trying to change \u2013 was underlined quite thoroughly here. It feels as though his motivation is revolution, and all the blood that might entail, rather than social reform. But those around him seem less convinced: without Jos\u00e9phine's intervention, Sophie would surely have spilled the beans on the group's target. I wonder whether the mention of a bomb shouldn't have given Jos\u00e9phine reason to walk away from the case, but this is Jos\u00e9phine we're talking about. Interesting, I thought, that while the bank employee was clearly terrorised by the raid, lost all her hair and was totally humiliated, she wasn't killed \u2013 as I feared she was going to be. Les avocats What exactly is going on with Jos\u00e9phine and Pierre Cl\u00e9ment here? Apart from still being sizzling hot, of course \u2013 anyone who witnessed that snog last season will be in no doubt about that. Set up in business together, with Pierre stepping in to keep Jos\u00e9phine from the clutches of Ousmanov, and proving he can be quite as devious as his partner when he has to be. (Not only is Ousmanov satisfied and out of the way, he can't come back: take a bow Mr Cl\u00e9ment.) Meanwhile, as Ms Karlsson is being fierce and brilliant as ever \u2013 Laure's face when she appeared to represent Sophie was fantastic \u2013 Pierre is taking on the appeal of an infamous criminal who says he has been framed for a murder after going straight. But why? For Jorkal's money? Because everyone deserves justice? Because he's been hanging about with Jos\u00e9phine too long? I'll be interested where this goes. Meanwhile, where is our favourite Ars\u00e8ne-Wenger-lookalike Fran\u00e7ois Roban? Apparently back within the next couple of days. Fingers crossed he'll feature in next week's episodes. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Despite evidence of a bomb plot, Sophie is freed. Not sure that would have been the case in the UK. \u2022 Was Gilou really wearing leather trousers in episode one? Officer Escoffier is fast moving from wrong crush to plain wrong. (I know, I know). \u2022 Jos\u00e9phine, however, looked sensational in her new blue dress. \"It's really nice,\" doesn't quite do it justice Pierre, as Ms Karlsson knows all too well. \u2022 Laure, meanwhile, wasn't exactly showered in compliments by her immediate colleagues. I loved the exchange between her and Gilou over Amina: \"How could anyone that pretty be a police officer?\" \"Thanks a lot.\" \u2022 The joy of Spiral is its ability to mix up the pithy one-liners with the bungling and corruption you'd rather not think about. Fremontin and Laure's to-and-fro with the obstructive university registrar was fun. \u2022 Laure's pre-reconstruction checklist: boots, gun, makeup, frock. \u2022 \"Not that useful, as far as corpses go\u2026\" I like that Laure et al look like they're enjoying the bloody autopsies as much as we are. *squeamish face* \u2022 Really: the crow eating the hand. It all went a bit Game of Thrones for a minute there. \u2022 Those new to the series trying to place Pierre (Gr\u00e9gory Fitoussi) \u2013 he plays Henri Leclair in ITV's Mr Selfridge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
