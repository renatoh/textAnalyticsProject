And as the demand for eating and drinking isn't about to disappear, it is a safe bet for graduates looking for employment. In fact, a recent Manpower survey showed that 21% of employers in this sector are planning to increase their workforce. If this has well and truly whet your appetite, here, we ask three insiders for their recipes for success. An employer says... Susan Coen, graduate resourcing adviser, Cadbury Schweppes (www.cadburyschweppes.com/EN/Careers) We recruit graduates into project and process engineering, manufacturing, logistics, finance, science and technology, and sales and marketing. We usually recruit into human resources and IT but haven't for 2007. We look at the potential of an applicant, not what work experience or extra curricular activities they have done. We worked with our company psychologists (YSC) to develop our assessment methods, using the potential criteria of judgment, drive and influence. The criteria are based on gaining evidence of behaviours that lead to success, so we look for these as opposed to demonstrated achievements. For example, if a candidate is asked to prepare a presentation, it isn't important whether they produced sassy slides and were confident in their delivery - what we look at is how they pulled together the information, how they decided what was important to include, and how they responded to new information. We believe the ability to give a presentation can be taught. All successful candidates will need to be competent in each of the areas of judgment, drive and influence, with a particular strength in one of the areas. An exceptional candidate will demonstrate strengths in two or all of the three areas. For 2007, the starting salary for a graduate is \u00a325,000, which is reviewed every six months while on the graduate scheme. Graduates also receive a \u00a32,000 joining bonus and an on-target bonus of 10%. Career plans are tailored to each graduate. We promise a real job with real responsibilities from day one. Some of our new starters have been surprised at the level of responsibility they have had in their first role. A university says... John Nutt, head of institute for hospitality studies, University of Derby, Buxton (www.derby.ac.uk/buxton) Most of the feedback we get from employers is that they want graduates who have got a good understanding of the vocational relevance of the job, and who come with management skills, people skills and social skills. All our students get involved in both practical and academic studies. We still insist that the students on our BA programme in hospitality undertake one year's work placement. A lot of institutions make that optional but it gives a level of credibility from an employer's perspective. We're very lucky because we have a fine-dining restaurant at the university, which seats about 80 people, a high-volume bistro operation, and a conference and functions venue. We have a number of events that students undertake as part of their academic study, so hospitality students work with our events management students to run fashion shows, trade events, concerts. The placement is at an alternative venue, which broadens their experience further. There are also opportunities for students to undertake paid employment outside of their curriculum time because we have events most weekends. It's important to take the opportunities offered by your institution - there is so much available for students these days that it can be taken for granted. Try to gain as broad a range of experience as possible, even doing work that at first may seem to be slightly irrelevant or not at the level you may aspire to. Getting involved at an operative level gives you a lot more credibility when it comes to looking for employment later on. A graduate recruit says... Helen Smith, 27, HR process adviser, Whitbread (www.whitbread.co.uk) I did a degree in tourism management with hotel management at Thames Valley University. My main aim at the time was to become a general manager in a hotel and I started at Whitbread in 2001 on a graduate scheme. I did six months in housekeeping, reception, and food and beverage, followed by admin and finance. Once I'd finished the programme, I did a three-month secondment going around the country training people on the Oracle HR system. Then I went behind the scenes working on computer systems. By then my profile had risen at head office and I applied for and got a job in HR. I look after Premier Travel Inn, Costa Coffee and David Lloyd Leisure. I love it - it's completely different from what I originally set out to do, but once I got into working behind the scenes I realised it suited me best. At Whitbread there are so many brands - you're not just restricted to hotels and restaurants, there are the coffee shops and the leisure clubs. And there are so many opportunities to change from one brand to the other. My advice is to try to get work experience such as a part-time job to get some background knowledge. And when you get into the industry, be open-minded and flexible. I never thought I'd get into HR, but I love it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
