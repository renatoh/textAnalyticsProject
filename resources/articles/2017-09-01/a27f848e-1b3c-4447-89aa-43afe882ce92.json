The Spain forward was subjected to constant abuse from the stands on Wednesday night as he returned to Madrid, where he had previously enjoyed two spells at Real, but silenced the home support with Chelsea\u2019s equaliser on the hour-mark. His header was guided home from Hazard\u2019s pinpoint cross with the players, who had only played alongside each other for 49 minutes previously, enjoying an instant understanding out on the pitch. The game at the Wanda Metropolitano was only Hazard\u2019s second start of the season, with Chelsea having treated his recovery from ankle surgery over the summer with understandable caution. \u201cBut it\u2019s not difficult playing with this kind of player,\u201d said Morata. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best three players in the world, and it\u2019s easy for me to play with him. \u201cMy own start at this club does not seem real. In the first official match I made a mistake [missing a penalty in the shoot-out as Chelsea lost to Arsenal in the Community Shield] and I suffered for a few days. People didn\u2019t see the situation, but I grew up, showed my strength of character and, now, things are OK. I hope to continue like this.\u201d Chelsea spent an initial \u00a357m on Morata over the summer, a club record fee, and his contribution has been key to date. The striker had struggled to impose himself against Arsenal\u2019s stubborn defence in a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge earlier this month but, in his other outings, he has excelled. There have been headed goals against Burnley, Everton, Leicester City and now Atl\u00e9tico, and a hat-trick plundered at Stoke, with the forward intent upon repaying Antonio Conte\u2019s faith in his ability. \u201cI came to Chelsea because one club and one coach believed in me,\u201d he said, reflecting on the frustration at life as a relative fringe player with Real and Juventus in previous seasons. \u201cNow I have all of these things and I\u2019m very happy. Playing in the Premier League is a difficult challenge. It\u2019s the most competitive league in the world, it\u2019s very physical, and it\u2019s the league with the most teams who can win the title. Strong teams. We\u2019re fighting for the Premier League, too, with another important match on Saturday.\u201d That fixture, against the league leaders Manchester City, will provide another opportunity to gauge Chelsea\u2019s strength in depth with Conte having already made clear his exasperation that the fixture had not been scheduled on Sunday, rather than Saturday teatime, to allow his players more time to recover from their exertions in Spain. The win at Atl\u00e9tico, in arguably the most daunting tie of the group, served to demonstrate the team\u2019s underlying qualities with the visitors dominant and deserving of Michy Batshuayi\u2019s winner deep into stoppage time at the end. No English side had ever previously won at Atl\u00e9tico. \u201cIt was a very important test for us,\u201d added Morata. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to win in Madrid, against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. This test means we are ready to fight. We\u2019re a very good team, and we go always with the same desire to fight, always to take the ball very fast for our possession. Now we have seen the Chelsea level [in comparison to] all the European teams.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
