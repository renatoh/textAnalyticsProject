The US space agency wants to build nuclear-powered spaceships, so has turned for advice to the naval reactors organisation, which has been running them in ordinary ships and submarines for decades. Last week, the two signed an agreement to jointly develop nuclear reactors capable of sending missions to the outer reaches of the solar system. First on the drawing board is a probe to visit the icy moons of Jupiter. Nuclear propulsion solves the main problem of flinging spacecraft that far into space - the huge amounts of fuel needed to get them there and slow them down when they arrive. But it creates a brand-new one: safety. Project Prometheus - Nasa's codename for the project - has had a distinctly low profile since the Columbia space shuttle disaster. Now it is back on the agenda. \"The development of this space nuclear power system will provide an important new capability to Nasa for carrying out space exploration, allowing us to explore further and do more science than ever before,\" says Nasa chief Sean O'Keefe. \"It will alleviate current limitations in space power generation and propulsion that have persisted for decades, and which limit our ability to explore the solar system.\" The extra electricity drawn from a nuclear source could boost the potential of new ion-drive engines, as well as power extra, more varied scientific instruments. Nasa says the Jupiter mission could blast off within a decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
