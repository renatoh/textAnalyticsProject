Of these, 559 were claims of a serious assault, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In South Yorkshire there were eight claims of serious assault in the same period, and 132 of lesser violence. A spokesman for the IPCC said that in general complaints against the police were rising, but it was not clear whether this was due to a better awareness of the complaints procedure or more alleged incidents. There have been high-profile assault cases in the past involving South Yorkshire police. Wayne Allen, 34, from Sheffield, won a case against the force for assault, unlawful arrest, malicious prosecution and trespass to a property in 2001. A spokesman for his solicitors, Fisher Meredith in London, said after the victory that it was one of the most serious cases of police brutality that he had come across. A jury at Sheffield county court heard that Mr Allen's two sons, aged six and four, were present during the raid, in which officers apparently refused to show a search warrant. After the search was over Mr Allen went to check on his children, but was intercepted by an officer who was said to have pushed and then punched him. Mr Allen claimed he fell to the floor and was kicked, while both his hands were tied behind his back. Handcuffs were apparently applied so tightly that a doctor advised him to go to hospital to check for fractures. The sister of Christopher Alder, a paratrooper who died in police custody in Hull in 1998, spoke out yesterday against the excessive use of force by officers. Liberty, the rights group, is taking the case to the European court of human rights because no one has yet been held accountable for Mr Alder's death. Five Humberside police officers were cleared of manslaughter and misconduct charges in 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
