I had been promised that I would finally get to speak to the man known to his fans and friends as the Amazing Johnathan, but the minutes tick past and the streetlamps come on outside my window. In his heyday, the Amazing Johnathan was earning $3m a year and had a stage charisma as outsized as his tricks, which included appearing to snort an entire jar of cocaine, and seeming to plunge a spike through his tongue. But tonight, as the PR tries frantically to put my call through to him, there is only silence at the other end of the phone. The Amazing Johnathan has disappeared. \u201cYeah, welcome to my club,\u201d laughs Ben Berman when I tell him about my failure to speak to the man born John Edward Szeles. Berman is the director and co-star of The Amazing Johnathan Documentary, which has already been compared to Catfish and Exit Through the Giftshop, which is pretty impressive, given this is Berman\u2019s first feature-length movie. But perhaps the most impressive thing is that he was ever able to film the Amazing Johnathan at all. \u201cThere were so many times when I was supposed to film in Vegas, or we\u2019d agree to be in this state on that day \u2013 and then it turned out that he and his wife were out of town that weekend. It was really hard,\u201d Berman says. Yet he spent two and a half years with the Amazing Johnathan. How could he bear being toyed with like this? \u201cI like his sensibility, all that darkness and irreverence. There were many problems caused by him, and as painful as it was, I knew it would be valuable for my film,\u201d Berman says. It is fortunate for Berman that he was able to see the bright side because to say the magician caused him \u201cmany problems\u201d is like saying Noah and his ark encountered some bad weather. Originally, Berman set out to make a short, straight film about the Amazing Johnathan, now aged 61, confronting his mortality. Since the 1980s, the Amazing Johnathan had been a staple on American TV, making guest appearances on talkshows where he would do tricks such as appear to swallow his own eyeball. He was fun and funny, not cheesy like David Copperfield but not po-faced like David Blaine. At the beginning of this century he landed highly lucrative gigs in Las Vegas, and his wild-eyed, leonine face stared out from billboards across the Vegas strip. \u201cI lived in Vegas in 2005 for a few months and I\u2019d see the Amazing Johnathan in adverts out there,\u201d says Louis Theroux, a fan of Berman\u2019s documentary. \u201cThere are certain people like that in Vegas \u2013 magicians, hypnotists, singers \u2013 and you think, are these people famous anywhere else? But he obviously wasn\u2019t a normal magician.\u201d Then, in 2014, the Amazing Johnathan disappeared. \u201cI was told I have a year to live,\u201d he announced during a talk that year. The audience, assuming this is another of his pranks, start to laugh, but he stops them: \u201cNot a joke,\u201d he says, his voice cracking. But after three years of waiting to die at home, the Amazing Johnathan was still alive and desperate to return to the stage. That was when Berman turned up. Except, as he captures in his movie, that is when the problems started. Because, as well as the difficulty of trying to film the Amazing Johnathan \u2013 who is either awol or smoking crystal meth in his bedroom \u2013 it turns out there are two, or maybe three, other documentarians also making a movie about the Amazing Johnathan. On top of that, Berman begins to wonder if the Amazing Johnathan is dying at all. After all, the evidence is right in front of us, lying in the pool, high on meth, three years after he was given a year to live. A friend warns Berman: \u201cCan you trust anything a magician says?\u201d Berman increasingly turns the film on himself, asking why he wants to make this documentary anyway, and whether he is disappointed that maybe the Amazing Johnathan isn\u2019t dying, and, if so, what does that say about him? He also confronts the other documentary crews. \u201cWhen you make a documentary, you are often aware of a journalist or director circling the same subject, and you either abandon the subject or ignore it. But you definitely don\u2019t feature the other team,\u201d says Theroux. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of showing things you\u2019re not supposed to see, like sound recorders, or someone tripping. But saying you\u2019re having to work around other crews, that\u2019s amazing. So I thought it was very bold of Ben and we get the sense of Johnathan as this supreme hustler and rogue.\u201d To say any more would commit hideous spoilers, but let\u2019s just say that much remains unexplained \u2013 including, most notably, whether Berman smokes meth with the Amazing Johnathan when the magician makes that a condition of them continuing to make their film. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t see me do it, so legally we\u2019re in the clear!\u201d Berman laughs. \u201cSuch a big theme of the movie is trying to determine what\u2019s truth and what\u2019s illusion, and there are still some things I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m going to stay cryptic on that.\u201d Berman also asks himself if there is something in his past that draws him towards this (possibly) dying magician, and so, with Johnathan now apparently out of the picture, he interviews his own, utterly delightful father, Doug. \u201cWhen Ben pointed the camera at me, I was thinking why would anyone be interested in me, and that the project could be ill-fated. But he was able to tell a very entertaining story with it!\u201d Doug tells me by email. Endearingly, Doug edits my questions during our interview \u201cto avoid spoiling some of the plot for your readers\u201d. It is reminiscent of how his son deconstructs his own documentary as he is creating it, unpicking the morality of documentaries such as the one he is making. \u201cI realised pretty early on that the movie was taking on a structure that wasn\u2019t traditional and, instead of seeing that as a negative, I decided to lean into it. I like that it became a documentary about documentaries,\u201d says Berman. Berman says his influences in the film range from Albert and David Maysles (Gimme Shelter, Grey Gardens) to Andrew Jarecki\u2019s All Good Things, with its twist of a final act. Theroux mentions Michael Rubbo\u2019s Waiting for Fidel, in which the subject of the documentary never turns up, as well as Nick Broomfield\u2019s Driving Me Crazy, in which the documentarian is repeatedly frustrated in his effort to make the film he wants to, about a musical show in Munich. \u201cSometimes it takes a non doc person to bring something to the genre that refreshes it. Like with Anvil!, which Sasha Gervasi made, and you can see that he\u2019s not a documentarian but a feature-film writer looking for a third act,\u201d says Theroux. As Berman says, much remains opaque by the end of the film, and just as I am thinking the Amazing Johnathan will remain mysterious to me, after various failed connections, I suddenly find myself speaking to him late one night. \u201cI like the documentary, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s not really about me \u2013 it\u2019s more about Ben,\u201d says the distinctive irascible voice down the line. But why did he have so many documentary crews following him around? Was that just to mess with Ben? \u201cWell, no one yet has made the documentary I want! And wouldn\u2019t you want as many documentaries as possible?\u201d he replies, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. He is not, he says, going to die any time soon, \u201cwhich makes me look like a big liar, but I\u2019m not.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t he stop smoking all that meth if he\u2019s so ill? \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop taking drugs now because I\u2019m dying \u2013 that\u2019s the stupidest fucking reason ever to quit drugs!\u201d he barks. The Amazing Johnathan has to go to the doctor now so I ask one last question: why has it been so hard for me to get hold of him? \u201cOh I just got the time wrong before,\u201d he says. Sometimes the mysterious truth turns out to be wholly prosaic. The Amazing Johnathan Documentary is released in the UK on 19 November. Louis Theroux will host a Q&amp;A screening of the film on that date, to be simulcast nationwide across the UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
