The \u201cchoreographic poem\u201d La Valse, first performed in 1920, is often seen as a nightmarish response to the horrors of that war and the annihilation of the Viennese world that was epitomised by the waltz, but Ravel himself rejected such an interpretation, describing it instead as: \u201cthe dizziness and voluptuousness of the dance, pushed to its paroxysm.\u201d Roth seems to lean towards the composer\u2019s view; his performance is less nihilistic than some readings, it\u2019s lighter, wonderfully athletic and full of brilliantly lit detail, though still mustering a real punch in the cataclysm of the final pages. It also makes a real showcase for Les Si\u00e8cles\u2019 gorgeous early 20th-century French woodwind sound and plush strings. But in Ravel\u2019s orchestration of Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures, premiered just two years after La Valse, it\u2019s the brass section that comes to the fore. Though the disc gives no details of where and when the recording was made, the sound is wonderfully vivid, and both in the opening Promenade and the final Great Gate of Kiev, the immediacy is startling. Roth conducts a new edition of the score that removes some of the amendments that Serge Koussevitzky made when he first conducted it, and also goes back to the manuscript of Mussorgsky\u2019s piano original to correct some details - Ravel had to work from the \u201ccleaned-up\u201d edition that Rimsky-Korsakov published after Mussorgsky\u2019s death. The result is like viewing a restored old master; every detail glows, exactly as Ravel would have imagined it. This week\u2019s other pick French music also provides the follow up to Vikingur \u00d3lafsson\u2019s hugely successful discs of Bach for Deutsche Grammophon. Debussy-Rameau mixes and matches pieces by the two composers: a selection of Rameau\u2019s Pi\u00e8ces de Clavecin are interleaved with extracts from Debussy\u2019s Images, Children\u2019s Corner and two books of Pr\u00e9ludes. The virtues of \u00d3lafsson\u2019s Bach playing transfer easily to his performances of Rameau; his clarity, crisp rhythmic articulation and unselfconscious stylishness are all admirable, though it can seem a bit relentless at times. But the Debussy is much less convincing. There\u2019s a whole dimension of keyboard colour and nuance missing from these prosaic performances; just a few moments listening to any of this music played by a great Debussy pianist, such as Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli or Krystian Zimerman, would be enough to show what\u2019s missing here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
