Ag\u00fcero is City\u2019s second-highest scorer this season, his tally of 17 behind only Raheem Sterling\u2019s 18. \u201cWe are so happy with what he has done; Sergio is on fire in this period,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cBefore we came here he had long periods of injury, and in these two years he didn\u2019t suffer that. He was banned two or three times [under me], because he\u2019s so aggressive without the ball and after that he was always good, always fit. So hopefully we can handle it until the end, because of course we need the striker\u2019s goals. \u201cOur success in a season is not just strikers but wingers and attacking midfielders, scoring a lot of goals from set pieces. But, of course, our strikers are our strikers. We need Gabriel, we need Sergio, we need both. We\u2019ll have maybe two months without Gabriel. Two months is a lot of games, so we just have one.\u201d Sterling and Leroy San\u00e9, who has scored eight times, are the wide players the manager referred to. Each may be asked to play down the middle should Ag\u00fcero need a break. But Kevin De Bruyne will not be selected there. \u201cKevin played as a striker in the Nou Camp [against Barcelona] last season but I prefer him in midfield,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe have other options, not like a striker, but guys with mentality to be around the box who can solve that problem.\u201d The manager could also play Alexis S\u00e1nchez there, if the club manage to prise the Chilean away from Arsenal this month. Jesus is not City\u2019s only injured player. Benjamin Mendy is out until April because of a knee injury, Phil Foden\u2019s ankle problem rules him out for around two months and Vincent Kompany is an ongoing concern and not available for Saturday\u2019s visit of Burnley in the FA Cup. Kyle Walker faces a late test on a leg problem. Guardiola acknowledged his mounting injuries were a threat to success. \u201cBut you have to handle it,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
