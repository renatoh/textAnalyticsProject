Drone footage filmed in June 2018 at a former barracks of the German armed forces in the southern town of Mosbach shows a group of around half a dozen men in military-style gear moving in formation across sandy terrain, holding what appear to be assault rifles in a firing position. Experts interviewed by the German public broadcaster ARD\u2019s Monitor programme after viewing the footage classified the exercises as \u201ccombat training\u201d \u2013 illegal in Germany unless carried out by active members of the military, police or private security companies and supervised by state authorities. The exercise in Mosbach, however, was organised by Uniter, a private support network for active and former soldiers and security personnel. Its founder, Andr\u00e9 Schmitt, is known to have founded and administered a Germany-wide Telegram chat group, which had sub-groups in which so-called preppers discussed plans to build up parallel infrastructures in preparation for the anticipated collapse of the prevailing social order. The group chat, which was divided into southern, northern, western and eastern districts, expanded in the autumn of 2015, when Angela Merkel\u2019s refugee policy became the focus of the national debate in Germany. Members discussed the threat of terrorist attacks and how to respond to them by hoarding weapons, munitions and food supplies. They have since dismissed their chats as \u201cthought experiments\u201d. When approached by Monitor researchers, Schmitt, a former member of Germany\u2019s Special Forces Command (KSK) who refers to himself as \u201cHannibal\u201d in the group chats, said the exercises in Mosbach had been part of a medical training course and that participants only had airsoft guns. Schmitt said in a statement: \u201cThe work of rescue workers and aid agencies in crisis and conflict zones is accompanied by so-called security elements.\u201d In an audio message heard by the Guardian and Monitor, however, Schmitt says the purpose of the exercise was to train \u201cgood infantry, who can be easily deployed, whether across Germany or anywhere\u201d. When asked why he was trying to train infantry, Schmitt told Monitor they were needed \u201cto support the medical response unit in the context of humanitarian UN missions\u201d. Internal documents presented on the programme suggest the exercises were part of \u201cKommando Pipeline\u201d training designed to produce in its last phase \u201ccombat-ready\u201d fighters trained in handling rifles and handguns, as well as close combat and urban warfare. In recent months a number of investigations across Germany have tried to establish a fuller picture of the network\u2019s activities. In November, a member of one of the northern German chat groups went on trial in the north-east city of Schwerin accused of illegally hoarding and stealing weapons, partly from the German military. A member of the southern network, a disgraced former army officer known as Franco A, is to stand trial over alleged plans to impersonate a Syrian refugee and carry out a terrorist attack that would be perceived as motivated by Islamist extremism. Investigators found a Uniter badge at his home, though the association denies he was a member of the network. Germany\u2019s public prosecutor general is also investigating a police officer and a lawyer who are suspected of plotting to round up and murder \u201crepresentatives of the political left\u201d. The accused deny any such plans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
