Finally, the treble predictions being said of Celtic are beginning to come true. With this CIS Insurance cup win over Kilmarnock, drawn-out phony war is beginning, at last, to be replaced by fact: prognostications - even uttered by opposition managers - are being supplanted by silverware. In a season that has held such promise - with the Scottish Premier League title almost assured and a Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final in the offing - the architect of this win had to be the Swede, Henrik Larsson, his hat-trick taking his personal tally for the season to 47 goals. So central has Larsson been to what is shaping up to be an unstoppable march to all the domestic honours, to have had anyone else's name on the scoresheet would have bordered on sacrilege. Not that Chris Sutton, his strike partner, had much opportunity to challenge Larsson for a place among the goals. By his own standards, Sutton kept his own counsel when the victim of Kilmarnock's physical game plan, but it seemed to make little impression on the referee Hugh Dallas who, at the first sign of Sutton losing patience, brandished a red card. Kilmarnock began with a general policy of heavy man-marking and a seemingly specific intention to get Bobby Petta. With Celtic's starting options reduced by the absence of Didier Agathe, Robert Douglas, Alan Thompson, Jackie McNamara and Stilian Petrov (the first pair cup-tied, the second pair suspended and Petrov injured), Petta was about all Celtic had to maintain their predilection for wide play. But a heavy challenge within seconds of the whistle by Gus MacPherson, followed by a second clatter on him shortly after by Alan Mahood, suggested a deliberate ploy by the underdogs. Impossible as it was to assess what the loss of Petta in the 12th minute through injury meant for Celtic, the departure of Ian Durrant for Kilmarnock in the 38th was all too evident. With Celtic successfully shackled at that point Durrant had assumed a magisterial pose in midfield, strutting the stage with an assurance that belied the fact he was returning from a four-month lay-off because of a knee injury. With his departure went Kilmarnock's best hope of confounding the formality most had anticipated before kick-off. \"I was feeling great,\" he said. \"My foot slipped and the knee just gave way. I heard a wee crack and that was it.\" His manager Bobby Williamson was to the point: \"Once he went off, we were struggling. We never cut Celtic open.\" For all their concentration in the first half, Kilmarnock undid their good work at the start of the second when Lubomir Moravcik's corner was won in the air by a combination of Sutton and Ramon Vega for Larsson to volley at close quarters just two minutes after the resumption. And then came Sutton's sending-off, for a rash challenge on Gary Holt. While Dallas had previously indulged some hefty aerial assaults by Kilmarnock's Chris Innes, he was less sanguine towards Sutton. \"It was a bit hard,\" said Celtic's manager Martin O'Neill. \"A yellow card perhaps. I've seen it since and I'm disinclined to change my mind.\" An exchange of two questionable offside decisions - to deny Kilmarnock's Christophe Cocard and Celtic's Larsson - helped bring the first half to a goalless conclusion, plus a decision favouring Garry Hay when he robbed Larsson of the ball in the Kilmarnock box with a risky challenge from the side. O'Neill believed his side's mental strength came to the fore following Sutton's dismissal and the evidence was delivered with two goals in seven minutes, the first again showing Kilmarnock's weakness on the left, Larsson's shot taking a huge deflection off Innes. The coup de grace was both energetic and delicate, Larsson running half the pitch with the ball before dragging Marshall out of position deliciously before finishing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
