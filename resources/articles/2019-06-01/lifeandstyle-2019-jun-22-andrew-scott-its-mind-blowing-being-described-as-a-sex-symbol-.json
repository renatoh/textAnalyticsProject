My parents are from Tyrone and Mayo. I went to a Catholic boys\u2019 school. It was a different time for Ireland back then. With the same-sex marriage referendum of 2015 and the abortion referendum last year, I\u2019d say that now it\u2019s a progressive country. I\u2019m very proud of Ireland. It\u2019s come so far. If they made me pope, my main thing would be to get rid of this nonsense that you can\u2019t be a religious person and a sexual person at the same time. I think it\u2019s damaging to desexualise any human being. Allowing priests and nuns to marry or just have a partner in life might have saved a lot of tremendous hardship. It also might be an incentive for people who feel spiritual to enter the church. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get asked to play Bond. They\u2019ll not be like, \u201cLet\u2019s get Scott in.\u201d I find it extraordinary that people are so infatuated. I say people. It\u2019s mainly just journalists. I don\u2019t think people are at parties screaming, \u201cWho\u2019s going to be the next Bond?\u201d They won\u2019t announce it until 2022, so it will probably go to some whippersnapper who will surprise us all. At the Baftas recently someone was like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re the hot priest from Fleabag, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge is writing the Bond film, will you play the villain?\u201d I thought, \u201cDidn\u2019t they see me in Spectre?\u201d That\u2019s showbusiness! So, no more villains for me for a while. People who go to the theatre don\u2019t understand the extent to which the actors talk backstage about the audience. It\u2019s such a weird alchemy that certain types of people create one atmosphere, but the next day you can have a completely different one. When you\u2019re sitting in an audience, you\u2019re not aware of what kind of audience you are. But the actors sure know. I did some ads when I was a kid. I did one for porridge. I wasn\u2019t a porridge fan then and I am not now. They needed to have the steam coming out of my mouth so I had to drink spoonfuls of hot water. Since then voiceovers for porridge ads have not been in abundance. I\u2019ve probably told too many people I hate porridge. I\u2019ve not Googled \u201cCan you have sex with a priest\u201d myself. It would be a bit weird if I did, wouldn\u2019t it? Having said that, you\u2019ve got to get your kicks where you can. I\u2019m quite relaxed about the whole thing. It\u2019s mind-blowing being described as a sex symbol. Whatever floats your boat, I suppose. But I think it\u2019s more about the casting. I\u2019m very happy that Phoebe put me in that part of the hot priest, because it was definitely uncharted territory. It\u2019s better than people being repulsed by me. So, I\u2019ll take it!
