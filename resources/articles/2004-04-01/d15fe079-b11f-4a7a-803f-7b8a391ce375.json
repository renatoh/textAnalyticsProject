Valdano echoed remarks made by the Real president Florentino Perez last Friday, who said he wanted Queiroz to see out his two-year deal which runs until June 2005. \"Coaches, up to now, have always seen out their contract. That is what has always happened since Florentino has been at the club,\" Valdano said. Queiroz found himself under fire last month, when the team lost the Copa del Rey final to Real Zaragoza and suffered a poor spell in the league. The England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was rumoured to have been lined up as a successor, although that eventuality diappeared when the Swede agreed to extend his contract until 2008. Queiroz's stock rose again last week as Real bounced back with nine goals in two matches. They lead the league, one point clear of Valencia with eight matches remaining, and look set to reach the Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, when they visit Monaco with a 4-2 lead. Valdano said the club were \"satisfied\" with the work of the Mozambique-born coach, who left Manchester United last June where he worked as assistant manager. \"He has administered the squad well from a physical point of view as well as maintaining its morale,\" Valdano said. Valdano also defended Queiroz from criticism that he has failed to rotate players, preferring to use David Beckham, Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, to promising reserves. \"It's very difficult not to call on some of the best players in the world. I sincerely believe that we haven't shown signs of weariness,\" Valdano said. \"That's why I don't see the need for making big changes.\" Zidane is expected to be fit for Real's match at Albacete on Saturday, although David Beckham remains doubtful. The Frenchman's bruised right thigh caused him to miss last night's friendly in Holland while Beckham has an inflamed muscle in his right calf. \"His case is more complicated because as it hurts him to run it's harder for him to train and therefore to play. We'll have to see how he develops,\" said Juan Carlos Hernandez, the club doctor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
