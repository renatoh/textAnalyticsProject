It is a little like Sightseers, the black comedy she co-wrote and acted in for Ben Wheatley \u2013 but with fainter tint of queasy humour. It reminded me more of John McNaughton\u2019s Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, or indeed the \u201cimpregnation\u201d scene from Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien. Prevenge provides a nightmarish satirical twist on post- and antenatal depression. On first seeing this film in Venice last year, maybe addled by lagoon vapours or the disorientating horror of the film itself, I aired my own bizarre theory that the title was a riff on pre-emptive revenge: prevenge, pretaliation etc. It was gently pointed out to me that it just meant pregnancy plus revenge. No other interpretation is needed. Lowe plays Ruth, a heavily pregnant woman with an intense and rational awareness that, despite the sentimental propaganda, pregnancy is a gruelling, painful and violent business, made even more traumatic by the condescending way women in her situation are habitually treated. And, perhaps as a result, Ruth is suffering from the paranoid delusion that her baby is telling her to kill people. And she duly does, over and over again. The film\u2019s sullenly monomaniac quality is entirely appropriate for the subject matter. Audiences may heartlessly laugh their heads off or remain in shocked silence. Both responses are fair enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
