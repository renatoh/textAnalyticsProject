The rest of us will be celebrating the decision in every stadium in the country. There will be widespread rejoicing among ordinary football fans over this victory, although it was not through listening to their voices that ITV decided to bite the bullet and relocate the programme to its traditional time in the Saturday night schedule. But that is not the end of the story. The next battle is to persuade the producers to abandon some of The Premiership's crasser \"innovations\" along with its ill-fated early-evening slot. Since the hubris of television people knows no bounds, we will not be holding our breath. The only higher power to which programme controllers and producers pay attention is that of the advertisers, whose wrath provoked the humiliating decision to move the show from 7pm to 10.30pm, starting in three weeks' time. But the size of the viewing figures is where the advertisers' interest begins and ends. What no one in authority will do is admit that the experiment has failed. Now someone - preferably with stronger connections to football than to television - should make a careful analysis of the whole strategy, and the reason for its failure. The origins of the mistake are pathetically obvious. Looking at the tabloids' promotion of footballers as major participants in the national soap opera, ITV imagined that they needed only to move the programme to a friendlier time, and emphasise its non-sporting aspects, to make a killing. Specifically, they thought they could sell the programme to women, who would be happy to accept it instead of Blind Date, with Des in place of Cilla Black. So they gave us winsome little \"earpieces\" at the beginning and end of each segment, featuring the likes of Robbie Savage's grandmother and Rio Ferdinand's baby brother. They even boosted the very colours of the match footage - all reds became a vibrant scarlet, all greens a pulsating emerald - in order to make the images look more like something from MTV or a Saturday morning kids' show. And instead of the rational analysis of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, we were given the empty bonhomie of Terry Venables - a waste of a good football mind - and Ally McCoist. Intending to personalise and glamorise the coverage, the makers of The Premiership merely trivialised it. It will be interesting to see whether the change of scheduling is accompanied by a change of style. If it is not, then it will be clear that the programme makers are incapable of realising the extent to which their failure is rooted in a fatal willingness to patronise their potential viewers. The show has no integrity, and the viewers - even those who do not know much about football - can smell it. But there is a more important point to be made. The failure of Premiership football to win a mass audience at prime time on Saturdays is the first public reverse for football since the top clubs began to grow fat on the proceeds of their new television deals. At a time when the top players' wages are virtually doubling every year, and a further boom in public interest can be expected in the wake of next year's World Cup, this may seem nothing more than a momentary aberration, a meaningless blip in an otherwise immaculate upward curve on the graph of football's growth. Such a conclusion would be misleading. Like the poor stock market performance of almost all the clubs that chose to turn themselves into public limited companies, the failure of The Premiership to deliver the expected audience is a very large sign that the growth of Big Football does indeed have its limits. No less than the custodians of any other business, those within the sport must recognise that a total devotion to \"shareholder value\" will sooner or later receive its just desserts. In ITV's case this was sooner rather than later. Now they will struggle to justify their greed, and eventually the rest of the football world will endure the consequences. But, as we all tune in at a decent time on November 17, perhaps even to an improved show, there will be a paradox to savour. Just this once the forces of the free market turned out to be on the side of the angels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
