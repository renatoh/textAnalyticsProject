Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episodes three and four of the third series \u2013 and if you\u2019ve seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. You can read the episodes one and two recap here. Crikey. This week\u2019s episodes certainly got us into open, if choppy, water. There was a raft of new faces \u2013 no small percentage of which were male, pale and at first a little hard to tell apart \u2013 as well as new plot lines. Hints were laid for future episodes, and red herrings exposed from the first two. Was it just me or were these episodes heavy on sex? And, on the whole, more creepy sex (I\u2019m looking at you Claes, the self-help guru who has just euthanised his father, and Annika, his strange groupie who \u201chappens\u201d to be a funeral director, and a scrambled egg pusher), awkward and unerotic (you know who you are), than anything particularly steamy. The theme of family continues, but not as we thought it might \u2013 there was little emphasis on the nuclear family or heterosexual marriages, as the supposedly politically motivated killing of Helle Anker in the first episode had indicated \u2013 and much more on father figures, motherhood, siblings and children. Saga\u2019s confused grief at her father\u2019s death is contrasted with the grief she\u2019s feeling over Hans \u2013 out of the hands of the murderer but not yet out of danger, he\u2019s in a coma, missing a hand. Saga fled her father\u2019s memorial service to go to Hans\u2019s bedside. And Saga\u2019s mum continues to be a thorn in her side, turning up at the office and calling Saga\u2019s boss to get her help hoodwinking Saga into going to the memorial service. Did this feel like massive professional overreach to anyone else? And so we see Saga spiral in a way we haven\u2019t before. She was upset as she watched Martin dragged off, but she was still on relatively sturdy ground \u2013 following the rules. She\u2019s on increasingly rocky emotional terrain this season, especially when it comes to her mum\u2019s claim that Saga\u2019s theory about her sister\u2019s death was wrong and had \u201cterrible consequences\u201d. Her language to the comatose Hans was telling: \u201cIt fit my knowledge of Munchausen by Proxy\u2026 I couldn\u2019t have acted in any other way.\u201d Where last week Saga reacted to bad news by methodically lining up the files on her shelves, this week her sorting of cupboards soon turns to smashing, with IKEA utensils all over the floor, as her colleagues look on. Hats off to the hoards of you below the line who clocked, unlike me, that there was something otherworldly about Henrik\u2019s wife and children a la River (never in my adult life have I felt more like I\u2019m back in GCSE maths, the only one yet to get trigonometry). By the end of episode four, it seems obvious that Henrik\u2019s family is in his head \u2013 hallucinations (they are \u201cmissing persons\u201d, not murder victims) rather than supernatural apparitions, which for me would be a bridge too far. Horns were locked this week \u2013 Saga and Lillian both butting heads fairly spectacularly with Hans\u2019s temporary replacement, Linn. Saga\u2019s best put-down was her correction of Linn\u2019s use of \u201cblog\u201d when she meant \u201cvlog\u201d. Her response to Linn\u2019s suggestion of sensitivity training because, after all, \u201climitations is just another word for new possibilities\u201d was poignant: \u201cNot for me.\u201d What else do we know so far? Morten Anker is dead. Shot three times, small impact area \u2013 the same as Aleksandr Dover \u2013 by someone he called his \u201cbrother\u201d. Cue the link to the \u201cKill Brothers\u201d, Morten\u2019s brothers in arms in Afghanistan, all three accused of rape and tortured \u2013 Kevin Larsen committed suicide a few years ago, which leaves Lukas Stenstrup. Ballistics reports show Morten and Dover were killed by bullets from the same gun so I think we can assume \u2013 but please don\u2019t quote me \u2013 that they were killed by the same person. It also seems the person who killed Morten was someone he had been trying to speak to urgently. The lipstick used on Helle and on Fabian was made by a company, FeliCity, that Lars, suspicious transport company CEO and husband of Lis, is on the board of. Confronted with this by Henrik he does do a fairly good job of showing up the absurdity: \u201cYou\u2019re saying I killed Helle Anker at my own workplace and then used makeup from the company whose board I\u2019m on.\u201d When you put it like that, it does seem unlikely, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re home and dry yet, my friend; he\u2019s still plenty suspicious throughout these episodes. And, as Henrik counters: \u201cSometimes murderers are cocky. They think they\u2019re better than police.\u201d Interesting when you consider two of the Bridge\u2019s convicted murderers have been policemen. Lukas Stenstrup is a Copenhagen gangster. On paper he\u2019s the kind of guy you\u2019d trust your kids with but in reality he\u2019s hot-tempered, with a dark sense of fun. He has an (overly) ready excuse for where he was at the time of Morten\u2019s murder and a penchant for sadistic games \u2013 he makes the infuriatingly hapless Marc play Russian roulette to win extra days to find 78,000 kroner Marc owes him (for what is unclear, though what is clear is that Marc should quit trying to win it at poker). As mentioned, Hans is alive but not quite kicking. The team was led to him by the discovery of Helle Anker\u2019s car (no fingerprints) with its heart on the dashboard (Helle\u2019s), pinned to which was a ticket to the ghost train. In a brilliantly horror-ish sequence, we leave the misty terrain of the neon-lit funfair to enter the cobwebbed ghost train, finding Hans strapped up, missing a hand but with a pulse. He\u2019d been given a scarecrow makeover, with straw stuffed in his shirt, hoisted on high. Is that going to prove significant? I\u2019m unclear why it wasn\u2019t mentioned. The thinking that the murders of Helle, Fabien and Hans are linked by them all being mentioned on Lise\u2019s vlog loses sway when it becomes clear that the spider loving wrong\u2019un Rikard killed Fabien in a bid to impress Lise. His shoddiness gives him away \u2013 he leaves fingerprints on Fabien\u2019s car and idiosyncratic comments on Lise\u2019s vlog that link his online persona (Knightrider) to the person who typed Lise a letter asking for \u201cappreciation\u201d. (Nice work, Cypher!) It\u2019s clear he didn\u2019t murder the others though - he doesn\u2019t take anything from Fabien and the other murders are are far more dexterously stage-managed. Rikard also tried to kill Helle\u2019s wife Natalie, who\u2019d just announced she would continue with plans for the first gender-neutral school in Denmark. Anna is an ex-Eurovision contestant (LOL)-turned-CEO of a family-run building company called Ekdahl Housing. She\u2019s having an affair with the 17-year-old son of her best friend. A call from her mum alerts her to the fact the affair is front page news \u2013 pics and all. How this plot will be woven into the main story remains to be seen. Theories? As previously alluded to, Marc is a tool. His pregnant girlfriend Jeanette tries to negotiate a \u201cpayment plan\u201d with Lukas and ends up running an errand to pay off the debt, while Marc stays behind as collateral. She collects a bulky bag but is robbed by men who take the bag to a house that looks like a Scandi architect\u2019s wet dream, where a man called Freddie (The Killing\u2019s Justice Minister Thomas Buch AKA Nicolas Bro!) tells his pal Colbert to \u201cresolve it\u201d. Perplexingly, regardless of Jeanette having been robbed, Lukas sends the pair on their way saying \u201cfrom now on you don\u2019t owe me shit.\u201d What\u2019s unclear is why he then has a black Mercedes 4x4 (a car that signals trouble, if ever there was one) follow them out, and how the bag then ends up back with Lukas, his rat-tail-plaited friend saying everything had gone \u201cperfectly\u201d. More on this next week, we hope. As night follows day, so Hans\u2019s hand led, indeed pointed, to the next murder victim, just as Helle\u2019s body part led to Hans. Next up is 72-year-old Lars-Ove Abrahamsson, a retired PE teacher from Oxie. Henrik sums it up neatly when he says this murder scene, like that of Helle and the not-quite murder scene of Hans is \u201cspectacular, staged, lit\u201d. What\u2019s missing? Well, we can expect a navigational nob in next week\u2019s episode. The bid to find a link for the three victims who can\u2019t be ascribed to Rikard takes an interesting turn when Henrik suggests thinking of them as random choices and focusing on the \u201chow\u201d rather than the \u201cwho\u201d. Saga and Henrik Well, what to say. I still miss Martin, but this new partner is turning out to be an abundant source of interesting story lines! And he certainly seems to be outdoing Saga in some key policing stakes. While Saga made some good observations on the state of mind of isolated Rikard \u2013 she seemed to find it easy to get into his way of thinking - Henrik is out in front in more concrete ways, remembering Morten\u2019s photo box and clocking from memory that the number plate on the white van used to transport Helle matches one at Lukas\u2019s centre. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t yet fully understand Saga, but he\u2019s certainly kind to her, if occasionally gently poking fun (\u201cWiki\u201d), and he did a good job both of stopping her going back into the ghost train and of talking her down when her gun was lingering a little too long around Rikard\u2019s temple. The two-season-long story of Martin and Saga \u2013 \u201cMight they? No, they probably won\u2019t, ever\u201d \u2013 now seems glacial compared to the hilariously matter-of-fact and abrupt sexual encounter this pair had. One thing: it was unclear to me why he insisted they go back to Saga\u2019s. Perhaps the memory of his wife would make being at his with another woman too much to contemplate? Let\u2019s hope Saga can help him solve his cold case. That\u2019s it for another week and it feels like there\u2019s an awful lot to get our heads around. No doubt I\u2019ve missed things so, please, pour yourself a lingonberry juice and share your theories about this week\u2019s developments in the comments section below. Thoughts and observations Does anyone else think that any/all swearing phrases in Scandi languages sound exactly like swearing in English, but in a Geordie accent? \u201cDo you think I\u2019m fucking joking?\u201d in particular. The scene where Lukas asked Henrik where he might have seen him before was hugely intriguing. Theories? Henrik\u2019s emotional speech to Rikard about killing children seemed particularly prescient. Besides anything else, it seemed like quite a niche romantic gesture from Anna to her 17-year-old lover: she\u2019ll offer to look into the unofficial policies that mean the workers for her company in Russia are prevented from unionising off the back of the oral sex she looked to be enjoying. What have Toblerones done wrong? Did Saga not shoot at Rikard as he jumped out of Natalie Anker\u2019s window because she couldn\u2019t get a good shot, or because she\u2019s not authorised to use her gun in Denmark? Dodgy of Lillian to ask Henrik to keep her in the loop on the case, when Linn had said she was off it. But even more dodgy was his pretending to have been in the shower. I\u2019m not sure I got it \u2013 did he not want to let on to his boss that he was spruced up to go to a singles\u2019 night? Would anyone else like to know a bit more about what Aleksandr\u2019s ex-partner, now heinous bungalow man\u2019s partner, is up to? She features briefly telling the police that Aleksandr had a house other than the one they had failed to find Hans in. If she knew about it, does that mean she could have killed Aleksandr herself? Some below-the-liners think the arm seen chloroforming Hans looked like a woman\u2019s. So are there three killers, Rikard included? It seems unlikely that Morten would know Sabrina as \u201cbrother\u201d. Was Annika\u2019s quest to bed Claes really just the elaborate plot of a funeral director out to bag a new client?! Surely not. Can we ban pork pie hats please? Marc wearing one for yet another poker game played behind his girlfriend\u2019s back was the nail in the coffin for me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
