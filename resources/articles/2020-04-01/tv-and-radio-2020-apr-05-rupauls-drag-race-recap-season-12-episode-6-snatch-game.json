Last week we saw Nicky Doll walk the plank, and were again left with the feeling that a contestant had left way too early, with more to offer ( Rock M Sakura \u2013 we love you). RuPaul is certainly making some interesting decisions this year. Maybe she\u2019s just had enough. Maybe she\u2019s trolling us all. We shall see. As episode 6 opens, Heidi pads into the workroom holding her shoes and rolling her eyes. She has the vibe of someone\u2019s aunt who\u2019s just been told by airport staff that they can\u2019t find her luggage, and we\u2019re here for it. Thank god she\u2019s still here. Brita says \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was in the bottom.\u201d Really? Aiden says \u201cquiet Aiden isn\u2019t going to be quiet for much longer.\u201d OoOooh! Expression shots! Dramatic camera zooms! Rattlesnack shade noise! Cut to opening theme song! Patricia Quinn dot Wikipedia dot com This week it\u2019s the fan fave (and undisputably best) yearly maxichallenge, The Snatch Game. No minichallenge, for the second week running. We can see why. In years past, many of the minichallenges seemed a bit forced and pointless. Aiden is doing Patricia Quinn, the actor who played a Magenta in Rocky Horror and basically nothing else. Picking a cult indie actor no-one\u2019s heard of, for a challenge where referential humour is tantamount, is so Aiden and so, so annoying. Fun fact; we\u2019ve just been on Patricia Quinn\u2019s Wikipedia page and she also played the role of \u201csecond girl at dance\u201d in a film called Adolf Hitler: My Part In His Downfall AND she played someone called Susan White in an episode of The Bill. She is Northern Irish but somehow we doubt Aiden will be doing a British accent. Miss Vaaanjie RuPaul enters the workroom accompanied by ex-contestant and catchphrase queen Miss Vanjie! She made her own name a catchphrasejust by walking backwards down the catwalk and saying \u201cMiss VAAAANJIE\u201d multiple times. It spawned a stream of merch, earned her several contracts with big brands, and got her cast in multiple music videos. Pop culture is weird. Vanjie asks Heidi how she\u2019s doing and she says she\u2019s \u201cdoing blessed and highly favoured\u201d\u2026 Oooo, kay. Jan\u2019s doing musical theatre legend Bernadette Peters \u2013 this could be great. We also get a quick and interesting insight into the audition process for the show, when we see a brief shot of Jan\u2019s audition clip, in which she impersonates Kris Jenner. We\u2019ve heard from our sources (drag queens on Facebook) that even just making the audition tape is GRUELLING. It requires multiple tasks and skillsets and, allegedly, you\u2019re not allowed to cut or edit it. It has to be done in one take. Blimey. Crystal Methyd is doing cult pop sensation Poppy! She\u2019s great, and her music\u2019s really fun and inventive, take a look if you haven\u2019t already. Needless to say, Ru and Vanjie haven\u2019t heard of her because her music\u2019s actually original and legitimate and wasn\u2019t produced by Lucian Piane. OOoooh, cue shady rattlesnake noise! As much as we love Poppy, we can\u2019t see how she\u2019ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul\u2019s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs. Gigi\u2019s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it. Good for you, Gigi. Snatch Game Here we go, it\u2019s Snatch Game! The two celebs taking part, and this week\u2019s judges are Mean Girls alumni Daniel Franzese (Damian \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d Leigh) and Jonathan Bennett (Aaron \u201cyour hair looks sexy pushed back\u201d Samuels). Heidi isn\u2019t really acting or looking anything like Leslie Jones but she\u2019s hilarious just because it\u2019s her. Jaida\u2019s Cardi B is pretty good. Jan and Widow are great as Bernadette and Tina Turner as well. This is a STRONG Snatch Game. Ru says to Gigi as Sophia \u201cI wonder if you can receive a big black cock?\u201d Err ... whatever happened to double entendre? Gigi\u2019s stunning, with some fab physical comedy and full of high tech puns, despite Ru\u2019s weird questioning. Aiden is not doing a Northern Irish accent and the jokes (if they can even be called that) are not landing. Sissy that walk The beauty team have REALLY stepped it up this year, Ru and Michelle look more flawless every week. Ru\u2019s metallic shimmer sensation is gorgeous and Michelle\u2019s dress is beautiful. We cannot say the same for Daniel Franzese\u2019s shirt ... thing [Ed: you are so, soooo wrong]. He\u2019s aged very well since Mean Girls though. Hi Daniel. This week\u2019s runway category is Frozen Eleganza (how much doooolar did Ru get from Disney for that?). Heidi, head-to-toe in white fur, says she\u2019s serving \u201cHigh Empress to the yeti folk.\u201d That\u2019s possibly our favourite runway voiceover quote from anyone ever. The platinum blonde hair really works on her. \u201cI CAN DO CONCEPTUAL LOOKS! I\u2019M NOT AFRAID TO GO TO THOSE PLACES!\u201d says Jan. Sure, Jan. Although, the look, while clever, isn\u2019t our favourite. Gigi\u2019s cute ice-cream girl wins, and deservedly so. Lipsync for your LIFE It took six weeks, but finally the two people who most need to be in the bottom two, are in the bottom two \u2013 Aiden and Brita. The song is OBVIOUSLY Let It Go. Side bar: there\u2019s a special place in hell for the loud people in gay bars who scream along to this song (there\u2019s also a special place in hell for gay bars that play this song). It suddenly starts snowing and Brita does some breathtaking witchery with a sort of flashing hand trick explosion thing. Bye Aiden. Notes and observations Shadiest moment Aiden\u2019s complete lack of acknowledgement that her character was Northern Irish. Catchphrase watch \u201cBlessed and highly favoured\u201d Animal print hunt Timid and tame this week at two garments, with just Crystal\u2019s usual leopardpint shirt and leopardprint neckerchief in her interview clips. Unless we count Heidi\u2019s yeti ... print? No, white fur is not a print. Just between us snowfriends A much better episode this week - it took a while but this season is finally picking up the pace. Some genuine laughs, and a collection of wow and WTF moments. What more can you ask for from Drag Race? \u2022 This article was corrected on 6 April as Patricia Quinn does not have a Northern Irish accent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
