While I cannot remember that match too distinctly what I can tell you from my time at Arsenal is that Fabrice is just a lovely lad. I played at Arsenal for many years and met many different players who were at differing stages of their careers but he stood out: as you will have heard other people say since this awful thing happened to him, he is a genuine gentleman with an amazing smile. That match against Sunderland was seven years ago so he can only have been 17 \u2013 not everyone gets into Arsenal's first team at such a young age so that shows how good he was, the potential he had. Fabrice was always willing to learn, he always wanted to absorb knowledge and he was one of those players who gives 110% all the time. He was very athletic, would move the ball on well and he had a great attitude on and also off the pitch \u2013 it was top-notch. Sure, it did not work out completely at Arsenal so he moved on to Birmingham City [in 2007 after a loan spell at the Midlands club the previous year]. But he was still a willing and able player \u2013 you could see that with how he has slotted into the Bolton Wanderers side [where he moved in 2008] and how he has been flourishing there \u2013 that shows how he had grown up from that boy I played alongside to become a man in a man's game. I believe when he came over here to England as a very young man from his home country [DR Congo or the former Zaire] he did not speak the language, so he set about learning English, while also fitting in and understanding the whole kind of psyche of being in England \u2013 grasping that and respecting that: managing all of this at the same time shows real intelligence and is admirable. I also grew up in east London like Fabrice did and managed to make it as a professional footballer and I know it wasn't easy for me. So what he achieved is all the more admirable, what with having to adjust to a completely different culture. It's such a shame that this has happened to him. He is only 23 years old and now this has happened \u2013 he has had a cardiac arrest on the pitch. Even though as top professionals we have all the tests, not everything can be detected. It came out of the blue because he'd had no previous problem \u2013 it is a bit of a freak-of-nature occurrence. To be honest, it's awful and quite scary what has happened to him because he is such a young lad. I cannot talk highly enough of him and it is just terrible that he is in this predicament and now fighting for his life. Please God he pulls through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
