And, on paper, it probably was. Sadly, though, it never quite hits the heights despite the brain power behind it. Based on Raleigh's courtship of Elizabeth - a relationship better covered in comedy terms by Blackadder - the charming Miles Jupp (Raleigh) stars alongside Munnery (Elizabeth). This is an unfinished show rather than a bad one and definitely worth a look. \u2022 Eden Court Theatre, Inverness, Sun 26; New Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, Tue 28; Royal Theatre, Northampton, Wed 29"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
