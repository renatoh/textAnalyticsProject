The Daily Mail \u2013 whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government \u2013 has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d The Telegraph has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson\u2019s defence of his senior aide. The Guardian The Guardian, which revealed Cummings\u2019s lockdown breaches along with the Daily Mirror, leads with \u201cNo apology, no explanation\u201d, highlighting the prime minister\u2019s refusal to back down despite public outcry over the aide\u2019s flouting of lockdown rules. The Daily Mirror The Mirror doesn\u2019t hold back, labelling Cummings \u201ca cheat\u201d while Boris Johnson is marked as \u201ca coward\u201d. The Daily Mail No holds barred from the Mail either. In a marked departure from its usual line, the paper \u2013 usually considered a staunch Tory ally \u2013 asks incredulously: \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d, suggesting that the government is out of touch. In a trail of its leader comment piece, the paper actually calls on Johnson to sack his aide. \u201cDominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown,\u201d it says. \u201cFor the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs. No buts.\u201d The Daily Telegraph The Daily Telegraph offers a more supportive headline, quoting Johnson\u2019s words from the daily briefing where he said Cummings acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. The Times The Times echoes the Telegraph in taking a milder line on the debacle, quoting the prime minister\u2019s defence that \u201cCummings acted like any father\u201d. The Sun Never one to miss a pun, the Sun has merged two lines from the daily briefing with the headline \u201cBacked to school\u201d, pointing to Johnson\u2019s promise that primary schools in England will reopen in June as well as his support for his chief strategist. The i The i presents a picture of \u201cChaos in number 10\u201d following demands from a number of Tory MPs for Cummings\u2019s resignation. The Daily Express The Daily Express stresses the prime minister\u2019s loyalty to \u201chis man\u201d, calling him \u201cdefiant\u201d in the face of calls to sack him. The Financial Times The FT leads on bailout plans for debt-laden companies, with Cummings and Johnson as the second story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
