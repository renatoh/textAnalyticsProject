The guarantee was given to them in a blessing from Vidya Chandra Vijayji, a Jaimaswamy holy man, as they knelt before him during India's final practice session at the Sardar Patel stadium yesterday. After they had been sprinkled with \"holy ash\", a light-coloured sand, the players were told: \"I come from God to tell you that you will make a hundred.\" The ceremony even included India's chairman of selectors Chandu Borde on the insistence of Narhari Amin, president of the Gujarat Cricket Association and a local politician. Borde, who is a Christian, not a Hindu, looked slightly uncomfortable. Ahmedabad remains a city of great religious significance for India. It was here that Gandhi lived for almost 20 years and became the spiritual leader of the passive resistance against British colonial rule. England's unofficial chaplain Andrew Wingfield-Digby, a leading figure in the Christians in Sport movement, has not been in India. In any event he gave up predicting results long ago. Vijayji first gave his blessings at the Wankhede stadium in Bombay 26 years ago to the West Indian batsman Clive Lloyd after his double century. Then the blessing was entirely unofficial - he was best known as an Indian supporter who shouted abuse from the crowd. Upon taking holy orders soon afterwards, Vijayji did so on condition that he could continue to follow cricket. His guru, whose image was on the packet of holy ash that the holy man handed out yesterday, granted his request. England, by contrast, will have to take refuge in fable. The story goes that Ahmedabad was founded when Ahmed Shah, a Mogul emperor, stopped by the River Sabarmati's banks and saw a rabbit kill a dog. He was so impressed by this that he ordered that a city should be built there. If England ever needed a venue where an underdog had famously triumphed, perhaps this was it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
