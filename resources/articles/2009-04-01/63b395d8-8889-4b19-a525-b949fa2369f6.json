Roy Hodgson, whose Fulham side fended off the kitchen sink with commendable calmness, added to the sense that all is not yet lost on Teesside. \"I think they can stay up,\" the Fulham manager said, without any obvious condescension. \"They pushed us to the limit and, had we been less determined and less willing to take part in a battle, they could have beaten us as well. There was a barrage but we stood up to it well, although we didn't play our best football, or capitalise on the chances we had on the counter-attack.\" Had Fulham done so, Hodgson felt it would have been harsh. Clint Dempsey, the indolent Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera all missed gilt-edged opportunities in the final five minutes and Andy Johnson hit the inside of the post just before half-time. \"I wouldn't wish that on anyone, let alone Gareth Southgate, who is a decent bloke,\" said Hodgson. \"If they play like that over the next five games, they'll pick up points.\" The questions, of course, are how many and will it be enough, bearing in mind Boro's next two matches are against Arsenal, at the Emirates, and Manchester United at home. Boro fans leaving the ground on Saturday were already talking about the trip to Newcastle that follows, although Southgate naturally said no games are a lost cause. \"I'm not sure there's ever a good time to be playing Champions League semi-finalists but we've picked up points in both of these fixtures in the past,\" said Southgate. The Boro manager will be hoping none of the opposing goalkeepers plays as well as Fulham's Mark Schwarzer did on his return to the club he represented for 12 years. The 37-year-old not only made two outstanding saves, he dominated his penalty area with an assurance which made the feverish crowd howl with frustration. It would, the Australian acknowledged, be ironic if the two points he denied his former team-mates made the difference between being relegated and staying up, but suggested the blame would lie elsewhere. \"You can't pinpoint one game and say, 'OK, it's your fault now.' It's a culmination of 38 games over a season. On today's performance they're not one of the worst three sides in the division, so you have to look at what went on earlier in the season.\" Southgate agreed. \"We're frustrated but not because of today. It's from weeks and months back. At the moment I'm not having any trouble sleeping because the players are giving everything they can. Looking back, there are always things you would do differently, but there were things that were completely outside our control. December and January were very, very unsettling for everyone at the club. \"The time for the real inquest is later, though in a way it's ongoing within ourselves as a club because that's why you change the way you work on a week-by-week basis. But we'll survive, or not, on the decisions we made as a group and the way we performed as a group over the course of the season. At the moment we're still in there fighting.\" For Fulham, Uefa Europa League qualification remains a possibility but a daunting one, said Hodgson. \"I have said many times Uefa [Europa League] has never been an actual target for us. But of course, if we continue to play well, maybe ... we will get a European spot,\" he said. \"If we were to get into Europe there'd be no question of me suggesting we need six, seven, eight top\u2011class players and \u00a340m of investment, because I know that's an unrealistic thing to demand. So, if we do get there, we'd have to do it with the relatively small squad we've got and make the best fist of it we could.\" Man of the match Mark Schwarzer (Fulham) Fulham had more of the ball - 379 passes to Middlesbrough's 300 - but a large number of passes were played in non-threatening areas, whereas Boro got the ball into the box throughout the game"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
