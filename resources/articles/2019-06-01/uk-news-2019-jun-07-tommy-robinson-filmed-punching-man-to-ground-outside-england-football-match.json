Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, can be seen walking purposefully toward the man before striking him in the head. Footage shows the man falling to the floor as Robinson shouts: \u201cFuck about again you\u2019ll get knocked out again, bruv.\u201d The video appears to have been filmed outside the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques in Guimar\u00e3es, where England lost 3-1 to the Netherlands in a Uefa Nations League semi-final match on Thursday night. The incident took place little more than a week after the English Defence League founder\u2019s humiliating defeat in the European elections. Deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, the lead for football policing on the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said: \u201cWe have been informed of an incident outside the Guimar\u00e3es stadium last night and the footage has been passed to our counterparts in Portugal for further investigation. \u201cAs with all the disorder that has taken place in Portugal over the past few days, anyone found to be involved in disorder could be subject to a banning order on their return to the UK.\u201d In a message to his supporters on Friday, Robinson showed no remorse. He said he had been defending himself and was \u201cfed up of being a punchbag for people\u201d. Robinson, who has at least five convictions for violence and public order offences, said: \u201cI was walking through there \u2013 I hadn\u2019t had a drink, I was with my wife \u2013 that man \u2026 come up to me twice getting rowdy, in my face, being abusive, being aggressive. \u201cYou can see his friend has his hand on him and I said to my wife: \u2018I can see where this is going to go, walk away,\u2019 and I said to the man\u2019s friend, \u2018Keep that man away from me.\u2019 He comes back up to me again like that and watch what happens to him.\u201d The footage shows Robinson, 37, striding towards the man saying \u201cWho said that?\u201d But it is not clear what the other man is supposed to have said. Addressing supporters on Telegram, Robinson said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait for him to attack me. Twice I warned him. Twice I warned his friends. \u201cAll those people there with him, they\u2019re not my friends, their his. Four of them are his friends. I told them: \u2018What does he think he\u2019s doing? Keep him away from me.\u2019 The man should keep his opinions to himself and his mouth to himself.\u201d In a separate video published by Robinson, the Luton-born activist is shown being challenged by a man inside the stadium about the incident. Robinson can be seen remonstrating with the man before saying: \u201cThink about it. You\u2019re with your friends and I\u2019m with my wife. Think about how much of a wanker that is. You\u2019re an absolute wanker, bruv. And that\u2019s what I said to you. If you\u2019ve got a problem, say it to my face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
