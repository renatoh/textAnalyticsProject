Luminar's comparative sales for the 26 weeks to August 29 were down 3.7%. The group, which includes bar chains Jumpin Jaks and Chicago Rock Cafe as well as night club brands Oceana and Liquid, stressed that the declines were becoming less steep. Since the end of the half-year the comparative sales decline had fallen to 2%, and was at 1% for October. Mr Thomas said there could be no certainty about when growth would return to the business as it approaches the critical trading period in the run-up to Christmas. \"I think we will have a better understanding in January,\" he said. Shares in the company closed down 2.5p at 497p. Luminar is one of a number of high street operators who are locked in a price war in many city centre nightspots, where bars have been springing up cheek by jowl during recent years. The group has come under fire for some controversial drinks promotions, which have been condemned as exacerbating binge-drinking trends in some cities. The cancelling of some more aggressive promotions by Luminar recently helped the group's margin gain a percentage point to 81%. Asked about the possibility that the government could follow Scotland's lead and introduce a ban on smoking in bars, Mr Thomas insisted such a measure would not affect Luminar. He said clubbers at his sites were more often looking to \"interact with the opposite sex\" than to have a smoke. The group's continuing cost-cutting programme saw two property sales during the half-year, generating proceeds of \u00a32.3m. A further site has been sold since, and agreement has been reached on the sale of a further five units. With 79 sites up for sale, Luminar has identified nine properties that it hopes can be sold as large residential developments. Planning permission on three sites has been sought."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
