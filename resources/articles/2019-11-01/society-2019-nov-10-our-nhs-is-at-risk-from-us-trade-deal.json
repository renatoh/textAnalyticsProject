Conservatives continue to parrot that the \u201cNHS is not for sale\u201d. We would like to set the record straight. Our NHS is already for sale \u2013 18% of NHS funding now goes to private providers, including Virgin Care, Priory Group (an American healthcare company) and others. The 2012 Health and Social Care Act required NHS trusts to contract out the provision of services through competitive tendering, which has inevitably led to private companies winning contracts. A trade deal could lock in current and future privatisation, making it impossible to reverse, as well as opening doors to ever-spiralling drug costs. Future governments trying to reduce or remove privatisation could be faced with expensive legal challenges from US healthcare companies and the risk of massive fines. As long as private companies are allowed to provide NHS services through competitive contracting, the NHS is vulnerable to Trump\u2019s trade deal \u2013 it\u2019s on the table. But if our NHS was an entirely public service, it wouldn\u2019t even be on the menu. That\u2019s why we urgently need new legislation that ends the privatisation of healthcare. So far, the pledge has been signed by more than 100 Labour, Green, SNP and Plaid MPs and candidates. Liberal Democrats have not yet signed up. We appeal to election candidates from all parties to sign our pledge, and show where they stand.
