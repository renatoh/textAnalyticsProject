Despite the start of a university career being more than 15 months away, the application to achieve that aim should be completed within the next six months, and the research required to make that an informed, realistic application should be under way now. The summer term is the season of higher education conventions and university open days. Both are an invaluable source of information for the prospective applicant and a good way to kick-start thinking about options. There are plenty of higher education conventions around the country over the next six weeks. At all of these there will be representatives from universities. It is essential to do some preparation beforehand, otherwise it can become an exercise in aimlessly wandering around gradually acquiring plastic bags and prospectuses. You're only likely to be there for an hour or so before tiredness sets in, so aim to have a word with no more than eight to 10 universities in which you have already established an interest. But make sure they do the course you're interested in! Think about the things you really need to know. These should include: \u00b7 Your proposed course. Ask about the entry requirements. Ask how the course is structured (the balance between lectures, seminars etc) and how it is assessed \u00b7 The university itself - location, and what's the accommodation like, particularly in your first year? \u00b7 What is looked for in your application apart from your exam grades - your personal statement and reference? How important are these? \u00b7 If you have a chance you can also ask about student facilities, graduate destinations from your course and if a gap year is acceptable \u00b7 Final tip: it's very useful to get a name of whom to contact (maybe the admissions tutor for your subject) if you have further questions subsequently. One last point: there may also be representatives to talk to you about gap-year projects, student finance and professional career bodies. And there may be seminars on various aspects of applying. It's bound to be worth going to at least one of these. Take five minutes on arrival to plan your visit to the convention carefully, to allow you to get the best out of the experience.

Try and get to at least a couple even if these are not universities uppermost in your mind just now. There is no substitute for seeing for yourself. If there's a chance to talk to current students, take it. Remember, though, you'll be seeing the university in a slightly unreal light - there may be few students around after the exams and most of your academic year will be spent through the winter, so try to imagine wet, cool and windy rather than warm and sunny. If the day was interesting overall and the ambience felt right, then maybe you'd fit in. Ask yourself the crucial question: can I see myself being here for three years?
