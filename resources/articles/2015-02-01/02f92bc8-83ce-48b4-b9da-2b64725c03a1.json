Shuttling between the London and New York jazz scenes, he\u2019s hired some of the classiest sidemen in the game \u2013 with this set including the Blue Note trumpet star Ambrose Akinmusire, Brad Mehldau bassist Larry Grenadier and Charles Lloyd drummer Eric Harland. Strigalev backs his presumptuousness up with a set of originals here that join old-school jazz-making to a sassy street sharpness, and trigger some memorable improvising, not least from Gretchen Parlato\u2019s intriguing New York pianist Taylor Eigsti. The Russian has a refreshing indifference to what\u2019s supposed to go with what in 21st-century jazz, so the opening Kuku sounds like a riffy Stan Tracey theme played by a 1970s Herbie Hancock band. There are playfully hooty tunes, unjazzily bouncing ones, some tenderly affecting balladeering, and mellow horn interweavings like classic Blue Note sessions. Strigalev\u2019s fusion of a tentatively probing, Art Pepper-like alto approach and a ducking-and-diving classic-bebop agility is at full throttle, the music seems to draw out Akinmusire\u2019s most impressionistic qualities, and Harland\u2019s drumming is jaw-dropping throughout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
