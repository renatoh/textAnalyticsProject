If They Soak Me, I\u2019ll Burn Them review \u2013 a meandering enigma", "bodyText": "A hybrid Chilean drama that blends fiction with reality and tells of a pyromaniac granny holed up in a sleepy coastal resort after she torches a jeep: the premise for Nona is intriguing. But the third feature from director Camila Jos\u00e9 Donoso, which stars her own grandmother, Josefina Ram\u00edrez, in the central role, is a meandering enigma that frequently asks more of the audience than it delivers. There are glimpses, amid the degraded found-footage style abstractions and the digital home video accounts of everyday encounters, of something fascinating. Josefina/Nona is a mercurial character, hardened by life under the Pinochet regime and unapologetic in her finely tuned spite. She recalls tyre-burning escapades during the dictatorship, torching piles of rubber just to see what happened when the police arrived. But the film\u2019s fractured, unconventional approach will make it a challenge for all but the most seasoned viewers of experimental cinema. \u2022 Nona: If They Soak Me, I\u2019ll Burn Them is available on Mubi"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
