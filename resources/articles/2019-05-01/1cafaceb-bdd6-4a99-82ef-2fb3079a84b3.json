Treating obesity is so difficult, said Tanja Vrijkotte, an associate professor at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, that midwives, nurses or doctors should intervene as early as possible, using the predictor tool to warn parents their baby could be at risk and supporting them to provide healthy food and activity. \u201cI think we should focus on prevention, for children to become healthy adults,\u201d she said at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow. In the Netherlands, children are assessed for being overweight at the age of two, at which time families may be offered help, Vrijkotte said. \u201cBut I think we should start earlier and use these kind of tools to discuss it with the parents. They can make parents aware that it is fine and there\u2019s nothing going wrong, but your child has an increased risk,\u201d she added. The team looked at data on 17 predictors of obesity from a large study called Amsterdam-born children and their development. Studying the outcomes of nearly 8,000 children, they found information on 12 of those factors was enough to make a 70% accurate prediction of which babies would become obese by the age of 10 to 12. Weight for length over the first six months of life, birth weight and gender were all predictors, and so were some measures related to deprivation, which included the mother\u2019s education and, in Amsterdam, non-western ethnicity. Smoking during pregnancy and later in the house, diabetes in the mother and the parents\u2019 BMI (body mass index \u2013 a relationship of weight and height which is a measurement of obesity) were all relevant, as was whether the child was attending daycare. Other tools and scorecards have been modelled in the past, some of them including genetic factors. But they are not in widespread use, possibly out of a reluctance by healthcare professionals to alarm parents or imply blame. Experts say there is a place for them, however. \u201cAny model that accurately predicts an increased likelihood of developing obesity allows us to intervene and provide targeted weight management support and advice at an earlier stage,\u201d said Dr Max Davie, an officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in the UK. \u201cWe know that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults with an increased risk of serious health problems, so being able to identify and help young children at risk would go some way towards protecting their health in the future,\u201d he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said childhood obesity was one of the most serious issues of our time and new tools to help GPs advise families could be useful. \u201cThe stark truth is that overweight and obese children face numerous, serious health-related problems \u2013 both physical and mental \u2013 in the years ahead, if their weight is not addressed,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is important that we don\u2019t get into the habit of relying on new innovations and interventions to help us and our children live healthy lifestyles \u2013 the best way to maintain a healthy weight will always be to keep active, eat a balanced diet, not to smoke, and for adults, only to drink alcohol in moderation. But new tools to help GPs target lifestyle advice appropriately, and at an early stage, would certainly be interesting to explore.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
