On a superficial level, this alternative UK is not so different from our own. The Lowestoft bus still runs on time, friends gather on summer evenings in the beer garden and Ed Sheeran is on the umpteenth leg of his latest tour. But something vital is missing \u2013 and only a handful of people realise what has been lost. As one character puts it: \u201cA world without the Beatles is a world that\u2019s infinitely worse.\u201d Fittingly, Boyle\u2019s film resembles a three-minute pop song itself \u2013 so simply structured as to feel skimpy and disposable until it snags in your brain like an infernal ear-worm and you find yourself pondering its implications for days. On the surface, the story is bright and perky. Underneath, it is desolate: a high-concept comedy about cultural amnesia and a wonderful Britain that might have been. I tell Boyle I think it might be a Brexit movie in disguise and he guffaws in embarrassment and reaches for his cup of coffee. \u201cYeah, well,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could certainly make a case for that.\u201d Seeing as we are in the business of making grand and sweeping claims, let\u2019s go one further. Boyle, it could be argued, is part of the same parallel cool-Britannia that Yesterday is longing for. He is the man who galvanised 90s cinema with Trainspotting, won an Oscar in the 00s for directing Slumdog Millionaire and presided over the all-embracing splendour of the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics. If he is not quite at Paul McCartney level, he is surely within shouting distance. A few weeks ago he rocked up as a guest on BBC\u2019s Top Gear and the producer bellowed: \u201cNational treasure coming through!\u201d Boyle laughs at the memory. \u201cSo yeah, you do get a little of that, the \u2018national treasure\u2019 thing. And that\u2019s all right, it\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019m happy to be a good ambassador.\u201d He pours more coffee and talks about Yesterday, which stars Himesh Patel as Jack, a callow young busker who is knocked off his bike and regains consciousness in a Beatles-free universe that is ripe for the taking. Before long, Jack is fixing a hole, passing off classic songs as his own \u2013 all the while terrified that he is about to be found out. Boyle accepts that it is a nostalgic film \u2013 or, rather, a film that examines the power of nostalgia. He likens it to Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, two other crowd-pleasing pictures about Britain\u2019s musical past. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting trend. In a time of complete uncertainty \u2013 politically, economically \u2013 people latch on to the things they can depend on.\u201d Boyle admits that he was always more of a Bowie and Led Zeppelin fan, but that is by the by: the Beatles influenced pretty much everything. Yesterday concentrates solely on the music, but their social and political impact extended well beyond that. \u201cIf you took them out of the equation, the ripple effect would be enormous. We\u2019d probably be living in this massive dystopian universe. It would take a novel to track just how much everything changed.\u201d Boyle is 62: a whippy live-wire, with thick-framed glasses and a shocking pink jumper, like an amiable geography teacher who moonlights as a seaside entertainer. Perhaps he is mellowing with age. Yesterday, for instance, is scripted by Richard Curtis, the saccharine McCartney to Boyle\u2019s acerbic Lennon. Back in the 90s, they were viewed as natural enemies. Wasn\u2019t Trainspotting (which Boyle made in collaboration with producer Andrew Macdonald, writer John Hodge and actor Ewan McGregor) seen as the gritty corrective to Four Weddings and a Funeral? Boyle chuckles and says he never saw it that way, that he always liked Curtis\u2019s work. \u201cThe truth is, after making Trainspotting, we were very cock-a-hoop and we thought: \u2018Now let\u2019s do a romantic comedy.\u2019 So we set off for Utah and made a film called A Life Less Ordinary. Then we came back and over the Christmas period I got sent this script called Notting Hill. And I read Notting Hill and thought: \u2018Well, that\u2019s a romantic-comedy. I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is we\u2019ve just shot in Utah \u2013 but it certainly isn\u2019t that.\u2019\u201d Boyle, for his part, spent the bulk of Beatlemania squirrelled away in Radcliffe, north of Manchester. He spent eight years as an altar boy and briefly considered the priesthood before working in theatre, TV and finally film, which he feels is not a dissimilar calling. As a young man, he thrilled to the work of the 1970s film-makers who seemed intent on pushing themselves and their congregation to the limits. Apocalypse Now, he has suggested, was his Damascene conversion. So if he were to wake up in a world in which Coppola had never made it \u2026 \u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, of course I\u2019d remake it, 100%, shot-for-shot, I\u2019m obsessed with that film. I\u2019d probably do Nic Roeg\u2019s films as well, because there\u2019s no one else like him, he was our Picasso. That extraordinary 10-year period, Performance to Bad Timing. I\u2019d remake all of those.\u201d If Boyle\u2019s work has yet to hit Roeg\u2019s peaks of wildness, it compensates with a bold, buzzing energy of its own. It also has a brightness of vision that is sometimes at odds with the subject matter. Whether he is tackling heroin addiction, zombie apocalypse or life in the Dharavi slums, Boyle runs at the material with a bounce in his step. He rarely allows himself to be burdened by fatalism or misery. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a positive person,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I suppose that makes me a positive film-maker. I feel an obligation to lift people somewhere else with my films. And I believe in the inherent goodness of human beings. That\u2019s naive \u2013 I recognise that. But it\u2019s what keeps me going through the bad times.\u201d Professionally, at least, Boyle hasn\u2019t suffered many knockdowns. He says he has learned that he is more comfortable on smaller productions, where he has room to manoeuvre and faces less pressure from upstairs. The Beach \u2013 a Hollywood behemoth starring Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 remains a rare leaden misstep, while he and John Hodge recently bailed out of the next James Bond picture, citing creative differences with the franchise\u2019s producers. I would like to get the full story on what happened, but his lips are sealed and his hands tied; there is not much he can say. \u201cI was with John and they didn\u2019t really like what we were doing and so it\u2019s far better to part company.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWhat we were doing was good. But it was obviously not what they wanted.\u201d Why did he want to get involved with Bond anyway? They\u2019re movies for producers, not directors; he must have known that. Boyle grins. \u201cYou should be my agent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, yeah, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s ultimately what you learn. But you\u2019ve got to go into that stuff optimistically. It\u2019s like falling in love. You can\u2019t go in guarded and trying to protect yourself. You have to be open-hearted and prepared to be hurt \u2013 and so what if you get a bit of bruising? You get well-paid and well looked after. So at the end of the day these are champagne problems.\u201d He insists he has put Bond behind him and no doubt that is true. But every now and then he is reminded of the bruising. Last month he went to see Claire Denis\u2019s High Life and was especially taken by Robert Pattinson\u2019s performance. \u201cAnd it was so bizarre, because I was sitting there thinking: \u2018Oh my God, they should get him to be the next Bond.\u2019\u201d Isn\u2019t Pattinson a bit too young for the role? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cHe must be in his 30s. How old was Connery? He\u2019s ready now.\u201d Ironically, Boyle\u2019s greatest achievement may not be a movie at all, but his four-hour Olympic opening ceremony in 2012. Isles of Wonder was a joyous salute to British culture and history that commanded a TV audience of 900 million. The event bounded from England\u2019s green and pleasant land, through the industrial revolution to the present day. It found room for Windrush immigrants and NHS nurses, Shakespeare and the Beatles, James Bond and the Queen. Tory MP Aidan Burley dismissed the show as \u201cleftie multicultural crap\u201d, while the Mail\u2019s Stephen Glover labelled it \u201cMarxist propaganda\u201d, but these were voices in the darkness. Even in the moment, Isles of Wonder felt special. It was a celebration of the best of British liberalism, maybe the culmination of it, too. At the time, Boyle said directing the ceremony had turned him into a patriot \u2013 or possibly made him realise that he had been one all along. He met with so many international Olympic workers who regarded the UK as a model society \u2013 a nation at ease with itself and its history \u2013 that he came away convinced. He saw his country afresh through the eyes of the world. I read back to him what he once said about those international workers: \u201cThey see us as a beacon \u2013 as a modern, progressive country.\u201d \u201cYes, they did,\u201d he groans. He clamps a hand to his brow. \u201cAnd, oh my God, I wonder what they think about us now. Would they even own up to saying that in the first place? You\u2019d have to ask them. But probably not.\u201d It is nice to think back on that Olympic opening ceremony. The further it recedes into the past, the more brightly it shines: the nation\u2019s golden last hurrah, before the days of Brexit and backstops; societal confusion and the burgeoning bad times. Boyle hasn\u2019t sat down to watch it since and says it would feel a bit weird. But he has a painting by his youngest daughter, who was 20 at the time, and was inspired by the industrial section of the show. It is very impressionistic; his one souvenir. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d he says. By this point I fear that we have become hopelessly lost down memory lane. We started the interview pining for the Beatles; now, we\u2019re coming over all nostalgic about the London Olympics. Boyle shakes his head and stares at the wall. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might be right.\u201d Still, he is at pains to remain positive; it is how he is geared. The times have gone bad and the country is in a mess. But he has faith in its people, its art and its industry. Its ideals are a bedrock, or perhaps a guiding light through the gloom. \u201cI believe that culture lives within us,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA and I really believe that, I can\u2019t stress that enough. So when you hear a great song for the first time, it\u2019s actually something you\u2019ve heard before. It\u2019s the culture that\u2019s within us and that\u2019s why it will survive what is going on at the moment. I\u2019m not talking about culture as a last bastion, but as something that survives and endures and that we\u2019ll eventually come back to.\u201d He\u2019s struggling for words and says he wishes he was more articulate. \u201cIt\u2019s progress we\u2019ll come back to,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading towards progress at the moment. But it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s not gone. It\u2019s progress we can return to whenever we want.\u201d Yesterday is released in the UK on 28 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
