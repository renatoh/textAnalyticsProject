But at last he has something to smile about. After weeks of speculation about his future with Benetton-Renault, the team's head, Flavio Briatore, is understood to have decided that the 21-year-old will keep his seat for next season. On the face of it this is no great surprise, as Button is in the first season of a cast-iron two-year contract. But so poor has his form been that his future was under threat. Briatore, one of the toughest men in a ruthless sport, seems to have had a rare bout of kind-heartedness. Sources say he feels Button deserves a second chance and that it would be wrong to drop him for performing badly in a poor car. A new engine and new parts for the car for the French grand prix two weeks ago gave notice that Benetton were beginning to dig themselves out of the hole they have been in since the beginning of the year. The same goes for Button himself. After being thrashed by his team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella for the first nine races, he was respectably close in France and believes he will be so again here this weekend. \"It has been more difficult than I expected to get used to a difficult car,\" said the Englishman. \"I wasn't as quick as I could have been at the beginning of the season, and I don't think the car and engine were either. But now I've got a better set-up on the car and I'm more comfortable with it.\" He still has work to do to rescue his reputation. It means nothing now that he showed well at times against Ralf Schumacher at Williams last year; this season the talk has been of how far behind Fisichella he has been, and attention has diverted from his on-track activities to his lifestyle off it. Benetton have expressed concern about the size of his entourage at races, which he has been forced to reduce. Button started this season expecting to go back to Williams for 2003 in place of Juan Pablo Montoya, but that is now a distant prospect. Thanks to Briatore's decision, however, he at least has a chance of redemption."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
