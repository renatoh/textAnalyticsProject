But the result against a disappointing Italian side does not provide much indication of how the real thing will go, as Ian McGeechan pointed out. \"It is a step in the right direction,\" the coach said. \"However, we will not get carried away because there will be tougher challenges to come.\" McGeechan gave some players on the fringes of his team a chance to show what they could do and none grabbed the opportunity more enthusiastically than Mike Blair. The slight scrum-half kept the pace of the game high with numerous quick tap penalties and scored a spectacular try from one of them after Chris Paterson made the running up the left touchline. The stand-ins kept their heads and kept on playing in the face of stiff and sometimes late physical challenges. Jason White and James McLaren were the other first-half scorers and Gordon Ross, Bath's debutant wing Simon Danielli and Brendan Laney added second-half tries. \"The guys put their bodies on the line for their country in tough conditions - and got what they deserved,\" said the captain Scott Murray. \"Italy are a massive and physical team and they were hard to stop but we did it very well and made the most of our chances.\" The Italians did contribute two tries themselves, with a first-half effort from the New Zealand-born flanker Scott Palmer and a wonderful flowing move that went the length of the field just after the break that ended with Nicola Mazzucato scrambling over in the right-hand corner. But overall the Italian performance was deeply disappointing. When their coach John Kirwan was asked whether this Scotland XV was better than the one that struggled to beat his side in the Six Nations game in March, the former All Black wing hit the nail on the head. \"I'd say,\" he replied, \"that we were much worse.\" Scotland: Hinshelwood; Danielli, McLaren, Henderson (Laney, 60), Logan (Paterson, 1); Ross, Blair; Smith, Russell (Bulloch, 35), Douglas (McIlwham, 70), Murray, Hines (Fullerton, 70), White (Leslie, 60), Petrie, Taylor.
