Mr Khatami's efforts to reduce the influence of conservatives would bring \"chaos\", Mohammad Reza Faker, of Qom Seminary, told the Farsi-language daily, Iran. \"Be certain that Mr Khatami and his clique will be demolished because Islam is more powerful and God supports this revolution,\" he said. \"The president wants to impose dictatorship, albeit a decorated one.\" Mr Faker is a longstanding opponent of the president and once objected to the American flag at an international wrestling tournament in Tehran. Iran's parliament has already approved one of the bills opposed by Mr Faker - to bar the conservative Guardian Council from arbitrarily disqualifying candidates in elections. Another bill which allows the president to check the powers of unelected institutions, such as the police and judiciary, is also expected to win backing from the reformist-dominated parliament. In order to become law, both bills also have to be approved by the Guardian Council. If rejected, they would be referred to the Expediency Council - another conservative body that arbitrates between the parliament and the Guardian Council. Political tussles inside Iran were further inflamed last month by a death sentence against Hashem Aghajari, a prominent university professor, for questioning the hardline clerics' influence. The professor's sentence sparked weeks of demonstrations by students. His lawyer said yesterday that an appeal would be heard shortly by a Supreme Court branch in Qom, Iran's main theological centre, and he was optimistic that it would decide that Professor Aghajari had not insulted Islam by questioning Iran's political order. In recent days both President Khatami and the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, have attempted to lower the political temperature. Ayatollah Khamenei called on all officials to cooperate in removing the barriers to effective government and resolving problems that have dogged the country. In a speech last week, President Khatami said he was hopeful of support from the Guardian Council in approving the reforms and added that Ayatollah Khamenei had endorsed the need to empower the president with \"the necessary instruments to carry out his constitutional obligations\". \"God willing, the bill on reforming the president's prerogatives and authorities will receive final approval and this will help the president fulfil his duties,\" Mr Khatami said in a speech reported by the English-language Tehran Times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
