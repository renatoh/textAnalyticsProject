Philip Mawer, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, said he was determined to end the practice of \"tit for tat\" complaints. \"I'm not going to allow the system to be made a mockery of by politicians or whoever,\" Mr Mawer said during an appearance before the committee on standards in public life. His remarks came after Sir George Young, the Tory chairman of the Commons standards and privileges committee, said last week that he would name and shame MPs who made \"vexatious, tit for tat\" complaints. One example of a trivial complaint, investigated by the former parliamentary commissioner Elizabeth Filkin, was the allegation that William Hague failed to register his free use of Jeffrey Archer's private gym. Mr Mawer was appointed to his post after the Commons authorities made clear they had lost confidence in Ms Filkin. She was criticised for being too open with journalists; Mr Mawer, however, said that he \"did not want to be the story\". But he could not be expected to behave in the same way as other parliamentary officials. \"I can't be just on a par with every officer and completely gagged in the way I go about my business,\" Mr Mawer said. Dismissing critics, who say that he has been hired to give MPs an easy ride, Mr Mawer called for extra powers to summon people and papers. \"It would allow for a slicker, swifter process of inquiry,\" he told the committee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
