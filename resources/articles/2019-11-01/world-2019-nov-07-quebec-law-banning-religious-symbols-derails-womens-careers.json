At 28, she is a newly minted lawyer with a master\u2019s specialization in criminal law. As a young woman of colour, her presence in Quebec courtrooms caught the attention of judges, other attorneys, even defendants \u2013 all of whom, she said, were happy to catch a glimpse of a rare non-white lawyer. \u201cIn Montreal, they say that a third of people come from somewhere else, and you really see it in court. There\u2019s a lot of black people, Arab people, Hispanics, and they were so happy to see me,\u201d she said. After a year articling with the Quebec vehicle licensing bureau Farhat was hopeful for the future. But the Quebec government dashed those dreams in June when it passed Bill 21, a controversial secularism law prohibiting the wearing of religious symbols by certain public-sector employees. Farhat wears a hijab, a non-negotiable item of clothing and expression of her Muslim faith. \u201cIt really shut all my doors,\u201d Farhat said of the law. \u201cFive months ago I would have told you \u2018I\u2019m a future Crown attorney.\u2019 I was so sure of my path. And now I\u2019m like, OK maybe I\u2019ll become an expert in insurance law?\u201d Farhat is just one of thousands of people whose careers have been derailed by Bill 21, which was rammed into law at 4am on a Sunday in June, after 16 hours of debate. She is watching closely as mounting legal challenges take on the discriminatory and possibly unconstitutional law. The latest was filed last month by one of the province\u2019s biggest school boards. Another challenge, also launched on a teacher\u2019s behalf, is due back in court at the end of November. The law disproportionately affects the province\u2019s education sector, where 74.5% of teachers are women. Bill 21 came after a protracted debate in Quebec over minorities\u2019 rights to religious accommodations. The law prohibits people in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols at work, including police officers, lawyers, judges and teachers. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers must only keep their faces uncovered. To further complicate matters, some established workers have been grandfathered into an exception clause that allows them to keep their religious garments and their jobs \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t get promoted, switch to a different employer or move to another city. The legislation doesn\u2019t name specific religious symbols, and theoretically all symbols \u2013 kippahs, turbans, crosses \u2013 are equally prohibited. However, because the law specifically mentions face coverings, and because of longstanding and effervescent anti-Islam sentiment in the province, many Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois agree the main targets are Muslim women. The bill was passed against a backdrop of growing anti-Muslim violence in the province. In 2017, six Muslims were killed and 19 were injured in a Quebec City mosque shooting. In Montreal, police figures show 58% of hate crimes in 2018 involved Muslim victims. Muslims represent about 3% of the province\u2019s population. Since publishing an open letter against Bill 21 last April, Farhat routinely receives Islamophobic screeds by defenders of the legislation. But she is determined not to be silenced. \u201cI have a voice. I will use it, especially when my own government doesn\u2019t want me to,\u201d she said. Amrit Kaur, the vice-president of the World Sikh Organization, receives her share of hate mail, too. The 28-year-old recent graduate is a vocal opponent of Bill 21: she would have been a Quebec schoolteacher this year had she been allowed to continue wearing her turban. Instead, Kaur reluctantly packed up her things and moved across the country to Vancouver BC, to accept a teaching position. \u201cI had no choice. I think at this point in my life, I need job security,\u201d she said. Kaur argued that the law reflects a profound lack of understanding about religions like Islam and Sikhism. \u201cKeeping your faith hidden is very much a Protestant way of doing things,\u201d Kaur said. \u201cYou need to understand that my faith, and the way I practice, doesn\u2019t work like that. And you don\u2019t have to be OK with it. You just have to accept that I have that right to live my life the way I want to live my life.\u201d Although not all Sikh women \u2013 or men \u2013 wear turbans, Kaur says that it was her personal choice to do so. \u201cI had pressure from people saying, \u2018Don\u2019t try it, people are going to racist towards you.\u2019 But I\u2019m going to live my truth.\u201d Among the province\u2019s chief justifications for the law is that it improves gender equality by freeing women from the constraints of oppressive religions. Critics say it targets women from religious and ethnic minorities who are already well-integrated into society, and damages their ability to earn a living and gain economic independence. \u201cMuslim women with government jobs \u2013 you don\u2019t get more integrated than that. They speak French unless they\u2019re teaching at an English school, they\u2019re part of a union. They\u2019re complying with all the rules and regulations,\u201d said Robert Leckey, the dean of McGill University\u2019s law faculty, who also suggested that those affected could demand compensation in court. For someone like Farhat, who is just starting her career, the damages are near incalculable. She regularly questions whether she can stay and raise a future family at home in Montreal. \u201cThe law doesn\u2019t touch [most Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois] one bit, but for me, it has disastrous consequences on my whole life,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
