Subs: Lastuvka, Boa Morte, Mullins, Faubert, Tristan, Bowyer, Di Michele. Aston Villa: Friedel, Cuellar, Davies, Laursen, Luke Young, Petrov, Milner, Sidwell, Barry, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor. Subs: Guzan, Harewood, Delfouneso, Knight, Reo-Coker, Shorey, Gardner. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire) Setanta have got a cut-price Benjamin Zephania to recite a little poem about Villa being quite good these days. He's right too, and Villa will fancy a win here seeing as West Ham are quite the pugilists away from Upton Park but the softest of soft touches at home. Martin O'Neill is asked how important the game is and says \"Imagine the size of the universe and compare it to the puny impact of a football game on a small island on a small island in the outer reaches of a small galaxy. Really this means nothing.\" Or maybe he says \"Crucial, we need these three points.\" I didn't really catch it because I was looking at Craig Burley's tie. An interesting fact. Ten years ago, All Villa's goals were scored by Englishmen. Could that happen in the Premier League these days? No. 1 min: And, just like all bets, we're off. \"What kind of perverse boss do you have that you seem to get stuck doing a lot of Aston Villa games,\" asks George Templeton, implying with absolutely no SIMON STURRIDGE IS GOD evidence that I'm a Birmingham fan. \"Is it Sean Ingle's way of torturing you or do you get some sort of masochistic enjoyment out of it?\" Can I tell you a secret? And it is a secret because I imagine only four people are reading this. Sometimes I quite like Villa. They've got the cleverest manager in the Premier League, they have good young players and they don't beat Birmingham 3-1 in lunchtime kick-offs like certain Berkshire-based teams I can think of. Does that meake me a bad person? 2 min: Villa work their way up the left early on and produce a cross that amiable yokel Rob Green gathers easily enough. 4 min: Cuellar is given several geological eras to run up the right and Lucas Neill has to head the ball out for a corner. It was shockingly lax defending and Neill isn't happy, not that he ever is. The corner is cleared by the way. 6 min: West Ham are keeping possession well enough, they're just doing it in their own half. Still, strong foundations and all that. 8 min: West Ham's first chance. The ball's knocked down the right and Bellamy squeezes in to send in a low shot that Villa keeper Brett Favre saves tidily. 10 min: More pressure from West Ham - as I said strong foundations - wins them a free-kick. The ball is nodded back across the box and Neill finds it at his feet. The shot's straight at Friedel though. 13 min: Cuellar is involved in a horrible looking collision that sees his knee go in interesting directions. Luckily he's OK to go on. \"Brett Favre,\" cries George Templeton. \"I know Brad Friedel is old, but he's not that old! Nor is he a selfish diva either!\" You haven't seen his rider list, George. Talking of Brett, he saves well at Bellamy's feet and Cole can't put the rebound away. Unsurprisingly. 15 min: Corner for Villa, won by Young. His corner is cleared but he then nutmegs a defender and West Ham eventually thrash the ball away. 16 min: Bellamy is at his ferrety best, darting behind the Villa defence and terrifying his opponents. 18 min: Free-kick to Villa, it's tapped across to Sidwell steaming to the edge of the box and his shot thunders two feet or so wide. 20 min: Favre fluffs an easy reception on the one-yard line and gives away a corner. Davenport's header flies over. Anyone else excited by this? I've got a horrible feeling I will be let down though in a V for Vendetta style. 22 min: Cole's header is blocked by Laursen. \"Brad Friedel is actually very old, wikipedia agrees with me,\" trumpets Ben \"Benny\" Bennett. \"'Born 1944, Britain: Summoned by a ritual performed by Rasputin in Scotland, Hellboy is 'born' in a ruined church near the fictional village of East Bromwich in England'\". 24 min: Some lovely pinging passes see West Ham on the edge of the Villa area, but Villa get it away. 27 min: Whoop! Scott Parker lets Ashley Young in and he skips past Green, but his shot clips the post. Should have scored, it was an unguarded goal. \"Just sitting here by the fire in a Santa hat watching the match and I've got something on my mind,\" says Laura Leigh. \"Has Steve Sidwell actually got his entire wedding vows tattoed on his back?\" Correct. 31 min: Ashley Young stands over the ball on the edge of the West Ham box. To take a free-kick. Robert Green is transfixed as it swirls wide of the post. \"I am excited about Watchmen but more to the point, extremely apprehensive,\" says friend of the graphic novel Richard Wood. \"Since the moral dilemma that was the point of the comic book has apparently been completely removed from the movie, I can only assume it'll go the V way, ie, adapted by a director who's terribly fond of comic books yet appears to be completely BAD WORD awful at understanding them.\" 34 min: Villa resort to a spot of Route Une, but Green gathers the long ball. Davies then almost puts the ball into his own net. \"Steve Sidwell's tattoo shows real commitment,\" says Gary Naylor, neglecting to analyse the political subtexts of Watchmen. \"It reminds me of the member of the Toon Army who had a tattoo of Andy \"Andrew\" Cole emblazoned on his leg - a day later, Cole signed for Manchester United.\" Let's hope Steve's wife doesn't sign for United then. 37 min: Collison unleashes a huge shot from 40-yards out that's deflected. It looked like it would have hit the target too and Friedel might have been in trouble. 39 min: More Bellamy trickery almost fashions an opening foe West Ham. They've been the better side so far. \"Is Laura Leigh sitting by the fire in just a Santa hat,\" wonders Sam Barritt. It would explain the need for a fire, I suppose. 42 min: Green deals well with a nasty backpass as Young bears down on him. \"Watchmen is already ruined by the sound of it, they've removed the squid and the whole film would actually be only 15 minutes long if it wasn't for all the bloody slow motion,\" says Ben Bennett. Hey! The squid is the best bit! \"In the meantime here's a picture of an Aston Villa final where everybody seems to have a headache. It goes with the comic theme.\" They just found out about the squid. 44 min: Behrami is given plenty of space and has time to shoot. It's straight at Friedel but so powerful he can only palm it out for a corner. 45 min: Villa break in typically zippy manner. Green saves once and then twice from Barry's follow up effort. Poor defending from West Ham and poor finishing from Villa. 45 min +1: Half-time. An excellent, vibrant game. West Ham have worked incredibly hard, but Villa have had slightly the better of the chances. 46 min: Let's go before the world is destroyed by a giant squid. Mullins is on for Parker. \"What's this? 90s Canadian 'alternative' rockers The Watchmen are making a comeback?\" gasps Mac Millings. \"I'm entirely underwhelmed.\" Seriously though, if you've never read The Watchmen, you should. It's the best book I've read all year. And I've read Dider Drogba's autobiography. 47 min: Bellamy has his first chance of the second-half but it doesn't cause Friedel too many problems. He's getting too many opportunities though, Villa should be snuffing him out more. \"Speaking of Watchmen, how about Bellamy as the image of the unmasked Rorshach,\" says Joe Pearson. \"Eerie, no?\" No. 48 min: Upson leaps above the Villa defence but his header loops across goal to the alarm of absolutely no one. 50 min: Neill's long throw is deflected off Luke Young's knee for a corner. Neill's header then goes over. It's been a positive start for West Ham, which is surprising as they have the worst second-half record of any Premier League side. 52 min: Superb one-touch football from West Ham, who continue their dominance. 55 min: At last, an attack from Villa and Petrov's shot is deflected for a corner. A big West Ham boot clears the danger though. 57 min: Reo Coker is on for Cuellar. He gets a warm reception from the West Ham fans. \"Mark my words, Villa will lose this game,\" cries Ben Bennett. \"As soon as Young and Villa get praised they proceed to lose to crap teams, it is about as annoying as every person in the world saying 'For perfect roast potatoes you've got to use goose fat'. We know, even the Inuits are doing it now, please be quiet.\" I was wondering why the Inuits made such good roast potatos. 60 min: That should have been 1-0. Cole had a free header on the far post and headed over. Well, it was Carlton Cole. \"Nicky Shorey. What happened to him? A year ago he was an England squad player now Villa play a centre half at left back instead,\" wonders Lee James. \"He always seemd pretty average but O'Neill must have known his ability beforehand? Oh and thanks for the Watchmen link, now my housemate is bouncing around insisting I must read the book, it better be at least as exciting as Alan Curbishley fighting a giant squid.\" It's better than that. 62 min: That really was a shocking miss by Cole. West Ham have played really well too, and given their dreadful home record they needed that. Or rather, they didn't need that. 64 min: Young wins a corner with some weaving trickery to take the pressure off Villa. Davenport, who has been good all game, clears. Bellamy then counter-attacks, squares it to Cole whose shot is saved at the feet of Friedel. Good keeping, rather than Cole being Cole. 67 min: More chances for West Ham. More wasteful finishing. A late Villa winner beckons. \"If you liked Watchmen, you should definitely have a go at the League of Extraordinary Gentleman,\" chimes Ed Whatley. Reddit. \"It features a gang of misfits, horrors and has-beens put together to save East London from utter destruction by shadowy threats to the Empire. A bit like this West Ham team. Except without the 'put together to save East London from utter destruction by shadowy threats to the Empire' bit.\" 70 min: Villa have a shot, but the winner is coming in the 93rd minute, so it curls wide. \"Rorschach unmasked looks more like Lee Bowyer,\" says Pranjal Tiwari. \"Bowyer probably has a subscription to the New Frontiersman too.\" 72 min: Booking for James Milner. \"West Ham are going down aren't they?\" says Lee James. \"That squad just reeks of a team that can't handle a relegation fight and around them only West Brom are worse, something tells me there will be some big parties in Sheffield and in John Ashdown's house.\" Lee, there are always parties in John Ashdown's house. If you count watching the snooker on telly and cleaning your girlfriend's korfball kit as a party. 74 min: Agbonlahor spins and prepares to unleash a volley but, as I said, it's 19 minutes to the winner, so the ball is cleared. GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!! West Ham 0-1 Aston Villa (Neill og 78 min) 16 minutes too early, Villa score. Milner weaves forward \"Watch this goal!\" cries my colleague and top darts correspondent Mikey Stafford. Milner's shot is deflected and loops over Green. Stafford hits the bullseye. 80 min: Poor old Franco. But that will happen if you insist on starting Carlton COle. 83 min: Corner to Villa. Petrov eventually shoots but it's way over. Tristan is on for Collison. \"In a long line at post office in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles and killing time,\" says Michael Aston. Toluca Lake post office lines are a killer, I agree with that. \"Perfect use of these gadgets. Go Aston!\" I assume that's in regard to Villa rather than himself. 85 min: Davenport kicks Young (accidentally) in the face. \"Is that a goal an example of the kind of breaks teams in the top four get,\" wonders George Templeton. Nope having too much money is the kind of break teams in the top four get. 87 min: West Ham get a chance for the first time since the goal. Unfortunately for them it comes to Davenport, who shoots straight at Hellboy. 89 min: Penalty area pingery by West Ham, but they can't get a clear chance. \"Just to note, I'm wearing clothes,\" says Laura Leigh. Turn the fire down then, don't you know there's an environmental crisis? 90 min: Four minutes of injury time for Carlton Cole to miss a sitter. 90 min+1: West Ham fans start to trickle home. 90 min+2: More West Ham fans trickle home. Cole has a decent shot but it meets a Villa ankle. 90 min +3: Villa play out time across the midfield. 90 min +4: Carlton Cole's header goes wide. And that's it, the ref blows his whistle. Postamble: Bellamy was excellent and West Ham should have taken their chances in early in the second-half. Villa probably didn't deserve to win and their goal was lucky, but if you want to break the Big Four hegemony, you've got to get lucky some time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
