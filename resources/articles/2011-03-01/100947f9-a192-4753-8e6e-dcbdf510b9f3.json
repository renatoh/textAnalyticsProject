The chart shows the results of the 2008 presidential election broken down by the state's 33 state senate districts. There are 19 Republicans in the body. Fully 14 of them represent districts where Barack Obama beat John McCain. Six of them represent districts where Obama won by at least 8% - that is to say, a reasonably big margin. What does this tell us? Nothing scientific. But it does suggest that they represent districts where there's either a fairly strong Democratic vote, or failing that, where lots of independents lean Democratic (independents usually lean one way or the other, in truth). And this tells us in turn that if the right kind of pressure is applied in the district, these six at least ought to be feeling some heavy pressure. There of course will be local variables that will affect how much pressure -for example, maybe the Democrats just don't have plausible candidates in this or that district, so the GOP incumbent has reason to feel safe despite the presidential number. But in general, presidential performance is a pretty good guide to a district's demography and voting patterns. Dale Schultz of the 17th district (carried by Obama 61-38%) said at a community forum last night that he wouldn't declare his position. FireDogLake reported that he told a Democratic colleague he was a no. Eyes turn next to Dan Kapanke, whose district Obama carried by the same margin. He said on Feb. 27 he was for the bill. Michael Ellis represents a district Obama carried by 10 points, but seeing as how he's the state senate leader, one doubts he's going to buck his governor. The Democrats need three defections. Even assuming they have the one in Schultz, getting another two seems tough. But this is good hard information that I thought I'd pass along - you can be sure, these are the sorts of numbers pols themselves look at and think about. It's all about their own necks at the end of the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
