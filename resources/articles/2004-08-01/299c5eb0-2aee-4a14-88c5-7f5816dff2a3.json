The 25-year-old man, who was not named, worked in a hospital in Sonthofen, Bavaria, and said he had killed the 10 patients aged 60 and over because he could not stand seeing them \"wasting away\" in pain, the police said. They are checking how ill the patients had been. Three bodies have been exhumed, but the postmortem results will not be known for several weeks, the prosecutor's office in Kempten said. The authorities there said there was no present indication that any of the 70 had been murdered, but the amount of drugs missing at the hospital had prompted them to extend the investigation. The 10 patients killed were six women aged between 70 and 89 and four men aged 60 to 88. The nurse worked in the hospital's internal diseases ward. If the 70 deaths are confirmed as killings, it is likely to provoke comparison with Harold Shipman, the British GP who killed at least 215 of his patients and hanged himself in jail in January, never having said what drove him to kill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
