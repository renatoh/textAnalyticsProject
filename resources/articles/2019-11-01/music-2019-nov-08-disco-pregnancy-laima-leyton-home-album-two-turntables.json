How messages from a marriage became a unique double LP", "bodyText": "When you are a musician and the primary parent at home \u2013 with five children between you and your partner \u2013 how do you make space to be creative? Especially when you have recently arrived in Britain from Brazil, and your husband, with whom you regularly make music, is often away for his work. Out of the culture shock and loneliness, Laima Leyton has made an album full of sharp, precise electronic pop: the inventive and thoughtful Home. Pulsing in between the sounds of Jenny Hval, Ladytron and Laurie Anderson, it is about the questions thrown at you by long-term relationships, parenthood and where you belong. \u201cI got to the stage where I wasn\u2019t fussed about being a big techno DJ any more, pleasing the kids,\u201d Leyton says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why can\u2019t I share the other things I think about? Why can\u2019t I turn that into music?\u2019\u201d Leyton\u2019s musical life has almost always involved Iggor Cavalera, her partner of 15 years and a founder member and former drummer of the metal band Sepultura (before then, Leyton worked in an art gallery). Since 2009, the couple have made electronic music as Mixhell and, since 2016, played live with Soulwax, Leyton on synths and backing vocals. They co-parent four children from previous relationships, and a son, Antonio, from their own. \u201cBeing on stage, being glamorous, being centre of attention, having champagne backstage \u2026\u201d Leyton reels off the experiences with mock grandeur. \u201cThen you come home to the laundry and the dishes, which applies to most musicians in the world, unless you\u2019re a super-superstar. But that switch is not always a bad thing. It makes you think what home means.\u201d Home was not S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, where Leyton comes from. She says the Brazilian music industry is geared towards commercial success, which didn\u2019t fit the music she wanted to make. Being with like-minded friends in a creative city felt more homely in theory, but Leyton found London\u2019s weather \u201cdepressing\u201d, her new existence isolating. She also hated the \u201cnagging texts\u201d she was sending her husband after he got work overseas \u2013 although she says she is very happy being the main parent at home: she is the kind of mum already begging the older kids to make her a grandmother. But then an idea struck. \u201cInstead of sending him emails or texts, I started sending him poems over synths.\u201d They are a beguiling mix. The first she wrote was Poem to Iggor: its lyrics detail \u201cthe days that everything seems undone\u201d, \u201cthe unfinished songs I don\u2019t sing\u201d. Before America suggests deeper intimacies (\u201cmy inside buttons, swallowed secrets and the black bath tub\u201d), while others have meaty names such as Power, Future and Anxiety. \u201cI liked using big titles then dismantling them,\u201d Leyton says. The best are inspired by her children. Power came after a conversation with Antonio, now 13, about death, while Home explores the weird push-and-pull of a mother wanting her own creative life: \u201cThe fear of living, the crave of leaving.\u201d Leyton has never distanced work from her kids, she says; she even snuck Antonio underneath her DJ booth once to show him what she did. She has also been busy working with the charity In Place of War as musical director of the Grrrl Project in recent years, bringing together female musicians from Ghana, Bangladesh, Brazil, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and the UK. It\u2019s another project, she says, that feels like home. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m desperate to go [to project initiatives] for weeks, then I\u2019m crying on the plane. And the kids are like: \u2018Mum, we\u2019re happy for you, please go.\u2019 Men just go. Women often don\u2019t have the confidence to go.\u201d Not that motherhood is a weak state \u2013 as one insistent, clubby track, Disco Pregnancy, asserts. \u201cPregnant women get treated like vulnerable creatures, which is crazy,\u201d says Leyton. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so strong since. I mean, I\u2019m growing two people here.\u201d Leyton\u2019s poems kept coming. Cavalera loved them. Soulwax\u2019s David and Stephen Dewaele felt the same (they are releasing them on their label, Deewee). It felt great making the tracks alone, Leyton says, but they needed beats, so she got Cavalera to do them while reacting to the music for the first time. And rather than syncing them together into a digital album, Home is a vinyl-only release of two albums packaged together. Tonal (Leyton) and Rhythmical (Cavalera) have to be played simultaneously, like an art piece, on two different turntables, to show the effort and the communication undergone (a digital single is planned for 2020). \u201cIt made perfect sense,\u201d she says. \u201cThe songs opened doors for us to talk about things that we wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to otherwise. Releasing the music like this shows it so clearly.\u201d The day her promo copies were going to arrive, Leyton was happy to leave the house to get on with everyday life; Cavalera was too excited to go out. \u201cAnd the kids were excited, too.\u201d Knowing that all this excitement came from her own creative impetus was pretty good, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely changed how we communicate as a family. And for that to come from me \u2026 there\u2019s just this joy.\u201d \u2022 The Tonal side of Home is out on 8 November on Deewee/The Vinyl Factory"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
