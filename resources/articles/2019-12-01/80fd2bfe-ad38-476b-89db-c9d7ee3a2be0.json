The two-time former champion never looked in danger against Dolan, who struggled to hit his doubles throughout. Anderson averaged below 80 in the first set but improved as the match went on, hitting seven 180s and a 144 checkout. After the game, Anderson told Sky he was relieved not to become the latest big name to fall, having missed a number of tournaments this year with a back problem. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting 12 months of practice into four days,\u201d the No 5 seed said. \u201cA lot of boys have gone out, and they\u2019re spending their Christmas at home. I\u2019ll be coming back this year.\u201d Anderson also paid tribute to Mikuru Suzuki, the BDO women\u2019s world champion who narrowly lost to James Richardson on Sunday. \u201cShe\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s a credit to the game of darts. It shows anyone can play.\u201d Vincent van der Voort also sidestepped a potential upset, beating Irish teenager Keane Barry 3-0. The 17-year-old averaged above 90 on an impressive debut, but Van der Voort \u2013 who was playing at world championships before Barry was born \u2013 landed the crucial doubles as his experience told. \u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t a comfortable game to play in, I\u2019m so happy to win,\u201d Van der Voort said afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m known as a quick player but at one point I thought \u2018I need to slow down\u2019 because he\u2019s playing too fast for me!\u201d The 43-year-old will face Dave Chisnall in the second round. Callan Rydz caused another first-round surprise, beating Ireland\u2019s Steve Lennon in a sudden-death deciding leg. The world No 34 took the first set before the Northumbrian qualifier took six legs in a row to go 2-1 up. Lennon then rallied to 2-2 by taking the fourth set 3-0. Rydz, who qualified by topping the Challenge Tour\u2019s Order of Merit, led 2-0 in the final set but was again clawed back as Lennon forced a deciding leg. Lennon missed two darts at double 18 to win the match, and the 21-year-old debutant clinched victory on double two. In the night\u2019s other game, William O\u2019Connor delivered some cheer for Irish fans at Alexandra Palace, easing past Finland\u2019s Marko Kantele in straight sets. O\u2019Connor faces a tough task in the second round against the No 3 seed, Gerwyn Price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
