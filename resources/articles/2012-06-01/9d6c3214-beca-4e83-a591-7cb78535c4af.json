The IOC has held an emergency meeting of its ruling executive following an undercover newspaper investigation. It has referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission, which could lead to a review of how Olympic tickets are distributed among member countries in the future. Sunday Times reporters posing as envoys of a Middle Eastern ticket tout claim to have found 27 officials and agents representing 54 countries who were willing to breach the rules on selling tickets. One, from Serbia, offered 1,500 tickets for \u00a380,000, while China's official ticket agency agreed to sell the best seats in the stadiums for up to \u00a36,000 each, according to the newspaper. It also alleges that Spyros Capralos, the president of Greece's Olympic committee, breached regulations. The IOC said it has moved \"quickly\" to deal with the allegations. \"After claims that several NOCs [National Olympic Committees] and ATRs [authorised ticket resellers] were reportedly willing to break the rules by offering to buy or sell tickets outside their territory, sell tickets at inflated prices, or sell tickets to unauthorised resellers, the IOC has ordered an immediate inquiry and referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission,\" it said. \"The IOC takes these allegations very seriously and has immediately taken the first steps to investigate. Should any irregularities be proven, the organisation will deal with those involved in an appropriate manner. The NOCs are autonomous organisations, but if any of the cases are confirmed the IOC will not hesitate to impose the strongest sanctions.\" The IOC said it will take on board any recommendations from the inquiry to improve the way tickets are allocated and sold internationally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
