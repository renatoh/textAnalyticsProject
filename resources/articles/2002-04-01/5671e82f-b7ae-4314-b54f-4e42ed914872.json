But even this otherwise unremarkable event was a product of Israel's siege: a doctor guided her delivery over the telephone because her mother was stranded in her home. \"When the labour pains started early in the morning, I hoped the army would lift the curfew and I could go to a hospital, but late at night when it got really bad, I was very scared because the tanks were outside,\" said Lubna Ramadeen, 23, cuddling her baby girl in the large wooden bed where she was born at 2am. \"The first time I called the doctor, he said: 'You are not the only ones under siege. We are stuck in the hospital and can't come out'.\" And so, as Israeli tanks rumbled past their flat, a doctor instructed Ms Ramadeen's sister-in-law in the mechanics of birth over the telephone: telling her to sterilise scissors, how to clear the baby's air passage and how to tie and cut the umbilical cord. It was a terrifying time. Ms Ramadeen's husband, a Palestinian activist freed from an Israeli jail a year ago was in hiding somewhere in the city. Her four older children had had complicated births, but Rania was a healthy child. As the siege of Ramallah entered its second week yesterday, such experiences have become increasingly commonplace as a deepening medical crisis throws a modern city back into a dangerous past. Israel's offensive against West Bank cities has shown no mercy for medical emergencies. In Ramallah, Israeli soldiers have stormed hospitals on three occasions, rousing newly delivered mothers and their babies from their beds, invading supposedly sterile operating theatres and intensive care units and ransacking medicine cabinets. They have rounded up doctors and medics, leading them away blindfolded and in handcuffs, and routinely shoot at ambulances and relief convoys. \"We are pretty desperate,\" said Ola Skuterud, the Red Cross representative in Ramallah. \"The army is paralysing us. There are people bleeding to death, and we know of people waiting for us, and we can not go out and reach them. Several times, they have taken the ambulance crew out of the vehicles, put them down on the ground and beat them up.\" Yesterday, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was paring its emergency services in the West Bank to a minimum after staff were threatened at gunpoint in Bethlehem and shot at in Nablus and Ramallah, and Israeli tanks crushed two of their vehicles in Tulkaram. \"This behaviour is totally unacceptable for it jeopardises not only the life-saving work of emergency medical services, but also the ICRC humanitarian mission,\" the ICRC said in a statement from Tel Aviv. In hospitals across the West Bank, doctors faced worsening shortages of oxygen, blood, antibiotics and other supplies. The neo-natal ward of the city's largest hospital yesterday had three premature babies strong enough to return home, who remained stranded in the ward because their parents could not reach them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
