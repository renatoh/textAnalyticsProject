Nothing about that is surprising. It's quite normal for people to go for a drink at the end of the working day, to gather with like-minded colleagues, reflect on the day, prepare for tomorrow and consolidate precious working relationships. Or, slag off their boss. It is certainly normal for me to go for a drink after work. My liver groans under the sheer normality of it. What was remarkable was the company. If you stumbled across me out with my workmates on a normal night, we would likely be doing one of the following: a) moaning b) bitching or c) cackling, after a particularly hilarious bit of moaning or bitching. It's not that we hate our jobs. Not really. You'd have to assume, I think, that people who can bear to spend their free hours with colleagues in the shadow of their office building can't find their place of employment altogether dreadful. But no matter how basically content you are at work, colleagues + alcohol = having a bit of a rant about the office. It is like gravity or Leona winning The X Factor: an absolute certainty. Or, so I thought. But we were joined on this evening out by someone strange and unusual. Someone who loved their job. Loved it! Loved. It. Honestly couldn't get enough of talking about it. \"This is what I've been doing, this is what I'm going to do, this is what I think about it all. Isn't it all just great?\" It was a bit disconcerting, I can tell you. Yes, I can see that a job as Scarlett Johansson's personal masseur must have its perks. but... no, I jest. The job in question is undoubtedly a good one, but I'm sure anyone else would find something - anything - bad to say about it. A wonky filing cabinet drawer, even. Please, for me? How about Facilities' annoying habit of testing the fire alarm just as you peel the ill-fitting plastic lid off your coffee, causing you to douse yourself in liquid caffeine, heated to approximately the same temperature as the earth's core? No? Suit yourself, then. He did try, bless him. There was a little bit of joshing about a run-in with an impertinent colleague. And, perhaps some resigned eye-rolling as we discussed working late. But it didn't really gel. His sheer delight in even the more irritating aspects of office life was palpable. \"Look at this! Office banter! Working late! God, this is living!\" Let's just clarify that this man is not a credulous fool. He just really, really likes his job. And has either never learned - or has, but can't be bothered to act on the lesson - that the cool kids don't admit to having fun in the office. But I was like that at school. Some part of my brain did comprehend that my social progress would be significantly assisted if I could stop myself saying things like: \"Double history? Brilliant!\" or \"Simultaneous equations are my favourite kind of sums. Or, maybe trigonometry. Ooh, I just can't decide!\" But I couldn't. I did overwhelmingly feel that reading Shakespeare in a warm classroom was a decent way to spend an afternoon, especially as the alternative was standing in the mizzle behind the design-technology block smoking and being inexpertly felt up by a boy called Gavin who fascinated criminologists and experimental dermatologists alike. Looking back, I am proud of my teenage self. Yes, I was so socially toxic that I was shunned by my peers. But I was being true to my geekish, maladjusted self. And if we have learned nothing else from American teen flicks, it's that the geek is right (and rather hot once you remove their glasses and braces). If you're lucky enough to have a job that gives you self-worth, satisfaction, enjoyable interaction, the pleasure of being part of an enterprise and money in the bank, what have you to complain about? Apart from the fire alarm tests, of course. That's just bloody annoying. office.hours@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
