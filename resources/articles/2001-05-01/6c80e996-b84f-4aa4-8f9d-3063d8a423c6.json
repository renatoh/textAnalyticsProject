This comprised walking along the King's Road from Waitrose to Safeway, a distance of about 300 yards. Among those Michael Portillo met were three Spanish visitors; a man anxious for him to get into government and form proper policies to cope with the certainty of reincarnation; and a pro-euro Financial Times reader able and willing to give him a history of sterling balances since 1976. Among those he did not meet was anyone who actually said they intended to vote against him. A huge percentage of those he met were tourists, of course. But most of the others seemed to be wearing Conservative badges, partly because he had the largest and most unnecessary team of helpers sighted this election, and partly because voters seemed to put up no resistance if they had one stuck on their lapel. Many of these Tories were under 70; some were even under 30. This may be the only shopping street in Britain where such an exercise could even be safely attempted. There are few copper-bottomed privileges left in Conservative politics. Representing Kensington and Chelsea is one of them. After the death of Alan Clark it passed in a byelection to Mr Portillo, whose famous defeat in Southgate now looks such a blessing: he missed a leadership contest that was not worth the winning; he had a chance to reinvent himself as a kinder, gentler Tory; and now he is here, in London's Blue Heaven. There will be no need to muster podium-graciousness next week while some Labour snit waves his arms about. This one's unlosable. Shoppers He could even have walked from his house to perform this exercise, though he didn't. But the Waitrose is even closer to another traditional political home. It is at the top of Flood Street, longtime base of the Thatcher family. (It's a rather socialistic kind of store to have at the end of her road, but there you are.) The supermarkets were chosen, the candidate said reasonably enough, as the only places on the King's Road where you might get a decent percentage of local shoppers. Even so, it was impossible to ignore the symbolism, and a snatch of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan kept coming back to me, as amended by Rory Bremner: All this fuss about Europe's becoming a farce We need a prime minister bolder than brass One who's spent his career stuck up Margaret's arse Portillo, Portillo, Portillo. But that makes the occasion sound jaunty. It wasn't really. There is a theory about this election that the contenders' moods are in inverse proportion to their prospects. Charles Kennedy appears to be having great fun; William Hague seems cheery enough; the Labour high com mand is collectively and perpetually vile-tempered. On Saturday Mr Portillo, in his complex political situation, was always on the edge of tetchiness. Mostly, he was charming; his handshakes were often long and warm; he listened politely to some very Kensingtonian complaints - \"those film companies make the most dreadful mess in the streets\" - and to many that had nothing to do with the constituency at all. He had cracked the King's Road dress code: weekend-ish dark blue jacket; beige slacks; brown shoes: smart/casual with just a hint of loucheness. But his charm has an on-off switch, and sometimes he got the controls muddled. \"You the Portuguese guy?\" asked one girl. \"No, Spanish.\" \"Pretty sexy, yeah?\" \"Who, Spain?\" \"No, you.\" \"Huh,\" said the candidate and stomped off. The ex-fan was left dumbfounded: \"I was just trying to be nice and he totally ignored me.\" An elderly lady wanted to tell him of the postal vote fraud she said was going on in the marginals because - under the new, liberalised rules - the returning officers were under no obligation to check the rolls before sending out forms, and a certain other party was taking advantage. It sounded to me like a claim worth a moment of even a busy Tory's time, but he had decided not to listen. He gave her a leaflet and dismissed her: \"My address is there somewhere.\" \"Hi, I'm Michael Portillo,\" he said to another man, who took a moment to assess the situation. \"Fine,\" he said, mishearing slightly. \"And yourself?\" But by then, the jacket and slacks had vanished into the middle distance. Well, it was difficult to hear anything. The traffic kept getting busier; while the postal-vote woman was trying to engage him, a poodle was yapping close by; the huge campaign team would have been a crowd even if there was not a shopper in sight. Despite all its delights for a Conservative, it is not an easy seat to represent conscientiously, which Mr Portillo clearly aims to do: \"People go to work early, they come back late, they don't like to open the door and they go away at weekends.\" It is not without social problems either, including, as he says, \"a lot of people who have, shall we say, seen better days\". He says he is spending more time here than he did in Southgate in 1997, and has stood outside a few tube stations at 7am, another setting not conducive to meaningful conversation. He is determined never to be Stephen Twigged again. That means, on the King's Road, having a lot of irrelevant conversations. When he was approached by the Spanish visitors, he grew animated and talked at some length, bringing to mind Joe Klein's remark about Michael Dukakis - expressed in G2 last week - that he was a cold fish in English but passionate in Spanish. I lost the Spanish here after the initial pleasantries, but I don't think they were calling him sexy. Job opportunities Waitrose was offering job opportunities starting at \u00a34.24 an hour. Between there and Safeway, it was possible to find \u00a314.50 notebooks in a minimalist stationery shop, \u00a350 pairs of knickers and verbena incense cones at \u00a39.50. Outside Safeway the sign said simply DEALS! Mr Portillo never window-shopped. He was not interested in possible Labour fiddles or being called sexy. He walked, whenever the situation permitted it, with the steeliest straight-ahead gaze in Chelsea, apparently staring at Friday week rather than Thursday week. Sexy or otherwise, it was not, on the whole, a pretty sight. I think Michael Portillo has re-reinvented himself.
