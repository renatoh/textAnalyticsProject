Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday unilaterally released the transcript of a congressional interview with Glenn Simpson, whose research firm, Fusion GPS, was behind the dossier on alleged contacts between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. The dossier \u2013 compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele \u2013 makes an allegation that there was a \u201cconspiracy of cooperation\u201d between Russian agents and the Trump campaign, and the president has frequently scorned it since its publication last January. According to the transcript, Simpson told Congress that Steele, the former British spy, stopped sharing information with the FBI just one week before the US election because of concerns that the law enforcement agency was being \u201cmanipulated\u201d by Trump insiders. According to Simpson, Steele \u201csevered his relationship with the FBI\u201d after the New York Times published a story in late October 2016 that said agents had not found \u201cany conclusive or direct link between Mr Trump and the Russian government\u201d. Steele was concerned \u201cthat the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people and that we didn\u2019t really understand what was going on\u201d. Feinstein\u2019s decision to make the transcript public renews a fierce debate about transparency surrounding the whole Russia-collusion investigation. Elsewhere in his 312-page testimony, Simpson told the senators that \u201can internal Trump campaign source\u201d or \u201ca human source from inside the Trump organization\u201d had reported his or her concerns to the FBI. Simpson said that this information was drawn from Steele after the FBI \u201chad debriefed him\u201d that fall. However, a person close to the matter suggested Simpson had got some details wrong about the human source during his evidence session in August and was actually alluding to the role of George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, who shared knowledge of the Russian hacking of Democratic party emails with an Australian diplomat. Papadopoulos is cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation into the Trump campaign as a part of a plea deal that he reached with prosecutors after admitting he lied in his first interview with the FBI. Steele had been compiling the dossier during the 2016 presidential campaign and approached the FBI, according to Simpson, because \u201che thought from his perspective there was an issue \u2013 a security issue about whether a presidential candidate was being blackmailed\u201d. \u201cHe honed [sic] in on this issue of blackmail as being a significant national security issue,\u201d Simpson said. Simpson cautioned that he was paraphrasing Steele\u2019s account, and added: \u201cwe did not have the detailed conversations where he would debrief me on his discussions with the FBI.\u201d He added: \u201cI think it was a voluntary source, someone who was concerned about the same concerns we had. It was someone who decided to pick up the phone and report something.\u201d He said that Steele did not rely on this source for his work with the firm. Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, said she released the transcript because \u201cthe American people deserve the opportunity to see what he said and judge for themselves\u201d. \u201cThe innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cThe only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.\u201d The Senate and House intelligence committees have also interviewed Simpson, but have not released any transcripts. Last week Simpson, a former journalist, requested in an op-ed in the New York Times that the committee release the transcript. The Republican head of the Senate judiciary committee, Chuck Grassley, declined to release the document and instead asked Simpson to testify in public. In his 10-hour 22 August interview with the Senate committee, Simpson said that the firm\u2019s research into Trump\u2019s past began as \u201ca kind of holistic examination\u201d of his business record. \u201cIt evolved somewhat quickly into issues of his relationships to organized crime figures, but you know, really the gamut of Donald Trump,\u201d Simpson said. Simpson also defended Steele, saying that the well-respected former intelligence officer \u201chas a sterling reputation as a person who doesn\u2019t exaggerate, doesn\u2019t make things up, doesn\u2019t sell baloney\u201d. By late September 2016, Simpson said, he had asked Steele about contacts with the FBI, with whom the British researcher had spoken. \u201cBy then it was obvious there was a crime in progress,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cSo I was curious whether he\u2019d heard back.\u201d Pressed about this claim, Simpson said: \u201cEspionage. They were hacking into the computers of Democrats and thinktanks. That\u2019s a computer crime.\u201d Steele has said he reported his concerns to the FBI in the summer of 2016. Simpson said that it was Steele\u2019s decision to take what he had discovered to the FBI in early July, explaining that the former MI6 officer felt a sense of responsibility. \u201cChris said he was very concerned about whether this represented a national security threat and \u2026 he said he thought we were obligated to tell someone in government, in our government about this information,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cHe thought from his perspective there was an issue \u2013 a security issue about whether a presidential candidate was being blackmailed.\u201d In his testimony, Simpson repeatedly praised Steele, his skills and his reliability, pointing out that the former British intelligence officer was the \u201clead Russianist at MI6\u201d who was \u201cextremely well regarded\u201d. He described Steele, who he said he hired in May or June of 2016, as \u201cbasically a boy scout\u201d. \u201cHe worked for the government for a very long time. He lives a very modest, quiet life, and this is his specialty,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWe got along very well because my speciality is public information. So he was comfortable working with me and I was comfortable working with him and, you know, we\u2019ve both been around a lot of criminal investigations and national security stuff.\u201d Simpson said that while he and his colleagues at Fusion focused on the analysis of documents, Steele\u2019s strength was his personal contacts to sources in Moscow and the Trump camp, drawing on his intelligence background. He said that at the time Steele was hired, the alleged Trump links to the Kremlin were an open secret in Moscow. \u201cThe thing that people forget about what was going on in June of 2016 was that no one was really focused on sort of this question of whether Donald Trump had a relationship with the Kremlin. So, you know, when Chris started asking around in Moscow about this the information was sitting there. It wasn\u2019t a giant secret,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cPeople were talking about it freely. It was only later that it became a subject of great controversy and people clammed up, and at that time the whole issue of the hacking was also, you know, not really focused on Russia. So these things eventually converged into, you know, a major issue, but at the time it wasn\u2019t one.\u201d In a statement, Grassley\u2019s office excoriated Feinstein for the release, saying she had not consulted with him. Her decision \u201cundermines the integrity\u201d of the investigation, he said, and \u201cjeopardizes its ability to secure candid voluntary testimony\u201d, including from the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
