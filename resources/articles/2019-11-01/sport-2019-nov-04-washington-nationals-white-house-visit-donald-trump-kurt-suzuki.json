During Trump\u2019s visit to Nationals Park for Game 5 of the series, he was greeted with jeers and chants of \u201clock him up\u201d by the home crowd. The Nationals went on to beat the Houston Astros in Game 7 last week to claim their first-ever World Series title, and received the customary invitation from the White House to celebrate. One player, relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, said last week he would not attend due to the president\u2019s \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d. Ten of his teammates were absent on Monday, although they did not specify reasons for their absence. One player who seemed to be happy to meet Trump on Monday was catcher Kurt Suzuki. When Trump invited him to speak, he donned a Make America Great Again cap. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was gonna happen,\u201d Trump said. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the team\u2019s longest-serving player, presented Trump with a Nationals jersey and paid tribute to the president. \u201cWhat an unbelievable honor to be here,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThis is an incredible honor that I think all of us will never forget, and we\u2019d also like to thank you for keeping everyone here safe in our country, and continuing to make America the greatest country to live in the world.\u201d Trump referenced the impeachment inquiry currently hanging over the White House. \u201cAmerica fell in love with Nats baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just fell in love with Nats baseball. That\u2019s all they wanted to talk about. That and impeachment. I like Nats baseball much more.\u201d The players besides Doolittle who did not attend the ceremony were Anthony Rendon, Javy Guerra, Joe Ross, Wander Suero, Wilmer Difo, Michael A Taylor, Victor Robles, Roenis El\u00edas, Raudy Read and Tres Barrera. Apart from Doolittle, all the players who stayed away are either Latino or African American. A number of teams and players have boycotted the White House visit since Trump became president. Alex Cora, the manager of last year\u2019s champion Boston Red Sox, stayed away after saying he was unhappy at the president\u2019s handling of Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. \u201cI have continually used my voice so that we Puerto Ricans are not forgotten and my absence is not different. Therefore, at this moment, I do not feel comfortable celebrating in the White House,\u201d Cora said at the time. The NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors did not attend the White House after title victories in 2017 and 2018. After the latter victory, the Warriors chose to meet former President Barack Obama instead. Trump was in attendance at a UFC event in New York on Saturday night. He was greeted with a mixture of boos and cheers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
