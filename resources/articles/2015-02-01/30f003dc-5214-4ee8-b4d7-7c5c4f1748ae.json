As in January, mild weather in February is not always welcome; indeed one proverb curses \u201ca fair February\u201d, as any change in the usual order of nature may disrupt the seasonal balance, and cause disease in people, crops and livestock. Hence another graphic saying: \u201cWhen gnats dance in February, the husbandman becomes a beggar.\u201d Fine weather may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be, either, judging by this Cornish saying: \u201cA February spring is not worth a pin.\u201d February has its fair share of holy and saints\u2019 days, including Candlemas on the 2nd, and the feast of St Valentine on the 14th. Though the evenings may be getting lighter, we are cautioned against assuming that the winter is already over: \u201cAt Candlemas Day, another winter is on its way.\u201d Others are more optimistic, with one saying confidently asserting that if there are clouds and rain on that day: \u201cWinter is gone and won\u2019t come again.\u201d Other February saints\u2019 days are also meant to mark changes in the weather, especially as we get towards the end of the month and the first signs of spring \u2013 birdsong, bumblebees and early wild flowers such as celandines \u2013 start to appear. But beware: late February and March can bring further freeze-ups; and however mild the weather has been, winter may still have some nasty surprises in store."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
