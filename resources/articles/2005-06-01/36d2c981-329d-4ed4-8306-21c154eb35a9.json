No poorly mother to look after, no Gardener skulking about, hardly any shopping or cooking to do, nothing to rush back home for. But after 10 years, one cannot easily kick the habit. I still have a strange longing to stay indoors, or visit the supermarket and cram my trolley with bulk delicacies, bargains and three-for-two of anything going, but what for? To moulder in the larder. So thank heavens for the dogs. They have saved my bacon. They cannot be left alone for long, they need tons of food, and they have health problems. They are fulfilling all my needs: something to flap over, rush home for, shop for and spend a fortune on. Soon I am resentful, bankrupt, anxious, worn out and happy again. Now both dogs have a ghastly stomach complaint. They require an exquisitely balanced diet costing half the Royal Mint, plus medicines and fairly constant attention. Meanwhile, I am almost penniless and living on baked potatoes and pasta. I go trailing out with my spinster basket on wheels and purchase the odd vegeburger and grains, occasionally splashing out on a tiny morsel of protein, sacrificing myself for the dogs. Bliss. Fielding is also experiencing freedom. Now he has retired from the horrors of the chalk face, he can doze in his garden under a tree in dappled sunlight. Yesterday he achieved little: broke the coffee pot, watched Moby Dick and fell asleep. He does not find his new life a struggle, but it does rather get up Mrs Fielding's nose. There is nothing more enraging than to see someone flopping about relaxing while you are slaving away. But last week I was forced to mellow out. Some chums invited me to the pub. Daughter was at home, the dogs were not alone, I couldn't dredge up an excuse, so I went out for beer and crisps, a novelty for me. But bad luck, it was footer night - the Liverpool game. \"Could you have been luckier?\" shouts Fielding. \"You saw history!\" No I did not. I saw madness: grown-ups crying, bellowing, jumping about, and a woman who can never bear to watch footer at home and see her children so agitated. But here she could go wild and scream or weep. What a jolly evening, but I left before the penalty shoot-out. I still have some standards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
