This is a syrupy family comedy relying heavily on the tinsel in the hope that yuletide sentimentality will earn it a free pass: it\u2019s a painful heartwarmer to give you heartburn. Danny Glover at least brings some poise to the role of Walter, a much-loved old guy who is preparing for his first Christmas since his wife died. He\u2019s invited all his lovably quarrelling grownup children, along with their spouses and adorably quirky-smart-observant kids, for an old-fashioned family reunion for the holidays. Clearly, there will be a lot of cathartic confrontation, laughter and tears before Christmas Day. Mo\u2019Nique is a potent presence as smart-mouthed Aunt May, and JB Smoove almost gets laughs as seedy Uncle Lonnie, obsessed with his lost career in basketball. Yet the solemn insistence on hugging-and-learning always kills the fun, and there\u2019s a borderline bizarre moment involving that most heartwarming of things: a shotgun. Weirdly, it\u2019s one of those films that only really comes alive in the outtake bloopers over the final credits, when the cast relax and have a little fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
