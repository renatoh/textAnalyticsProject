The doctor asks him to drop his trousers and turn around. The man hears snipping. The doctor says that he has sorted out the problem. \"How?\" asks the patient. \"I've cut six inches off the bottom of your string vest.\" Why am I inflicting these ancient medical gags on you? Partly because, with Crapmas imminent, this is a time of bad, old jokes from crackers, read out at the dinner table with strained enthusiasm. I submit that my gags are superior, and could be used in the event of a joke vacuum over lunch. If delivered correctly, they are all sure-fire giggle-makers. The other reason is that I am currently in hospital, so my mind is on things medical. I am surrounded and penetrated by catheters, tubes, swabs and surgical gloves - a situation that is not conducive to any kind of chin-stroking contemplation. Meanwhile, the drugs they give you here are plentiful but not designed to set your mind racing with intellectual thoughts. I am thick as a brick. Compared with dumb and dumber, I am dumbest. The book I have been reading lately, Bad Blood by Lorna Sage, has received many hours of my attention, but I am finding it hard to follow. It's an account of a girlhood spent in postwar provincial Britain. What I have managed to take in, I have enjoyed, but if you challenged me about the car-chase sequence, I would not realise that you were taking the rise. Are you? My brain is ticking over so slowly that it has taken me two years to write this article so far, even though I allowed myself the luxury of starting it with several standard jokes. God, it must be depressing if your thoughts are always this flat and unprofitable. I have just heard that I may still be incarcerated on Christmas day, and have had an awful vision. The bravest people in hospital at this time of year are the children, so they will get top stars coming by to patronise them. But you won't get Carol Smillie beaming into the middle-aged men's ward. No Posh and Becks down this end of the place. Who will it be? Dirty Den? Mark Lawrenson? What have I got to say to the Bishop of Tooting? Enough.
