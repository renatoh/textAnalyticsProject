The answer is they all believe they have become better public servants after experiencing what they see as a unique course at an English university that has received worldwide acclaim. And yet on December 23 last year Nottingham's local evening newspaper reported the scandalous news that council leader Mick Warner and fellow elected member Joyce Bosnjak were taking masters degrees in public administration at a combined cost to the taxpayer of \u00a355,000. The cash included \u00a333,000 tuition fees for studying at an elite business school, travel, accommodation and meal costs, and a \u00a310,000 optional trip to the US, the newspaper reported. There was particular outrage at suggestions the pair had flown business class to the States for a two-week study trip at a reported cost of \u00a32,000, 10 times the price of an economy fare. The course which attracted such controversy was the master's degree in public administration (MPA) at the University of Warwick. Launched in 2001 as the first public sector MBA in the UK, it has attracted senior policymakers and managers from all levels of government, be that European, national, regional or local. The public servants that have opted to increase their skills come from across a wide range of sectors, including the national health service, education, housing, police, prison service, fire service, arts and media, along with churches and the voluntary sector. Professor John Benington, director of the Institute of Governance and Public Management at the university, has been the driving force behind the success of the course. He says: \"It was set up because of growing evidence that public sector policymakers and managers were facing increasingly complex challenges and needed a high level course which helped to enhance both their knowledge and their capability to lead and manage change and improvement in public services.\" Professor Benington says the MPA is designed not only to stimulate individual learning but also to contribute to improved organisational performance. \"We have many examples of Warwick MPA learning being applied effectively in tackling complex practical problems in the participant's own organisation, in the civil service, local government, the police and the voluntary sector.\" Testimony to that comes from one of Northern Ireland's most senior police officers, Chief Superintendent Irwin Turbitt. He took the course over two years, completing it last month. He found it invaluable for his work in the province. \"The attraction of the course was the desire to use theory to form practice. What impressed me so much was the academic staff at Warwick were passionate about the practical implementation of the theory. \"I looked at doing an MBA, but I knew there would be much to be done outside the course converting the work into my needs. With the MPA that conversion was part of the work itself. \"It may seem surprising that the course can be applied to operational policing in North Ireland, but it is true. A major part of my job is providing leadership, both internally and externally, and building up partnerships. There has been a wealth of knowledge gained through this course.\" Robert Standfield, head of workforce with the West Midlands (south) strategic health authority, is another public servant who has benefited from the Warwick MPA. He was looking for a master's course but the MBA was too focused on the business side of management. He found Warwick's alternative to be built on a values base directly linked to the public services. \"It has broadened my horizons, brought me in touch with people from a whole range of services with whom I want to develop partnerships on behalf of the health service,\" he said. \"It's helping me improve health.\" Mick Young believes the knowledge he has gleaned from the course is helping him improve local government. He is leader of Northamptonshire county council and is in his third year of the MPA. \"You are put in a position where you are with a number of people from a variety of disciplines grappling with issues. The beauty of this is you are in a safe environment, whereas in a fiercely competitive political system you don't get that. \"There is a breadth of learning because you have all those disciplines. There is also depth because the course is academically challenging. There is a cross fertilisation of ideas and all this is taken back to the local authority.\" There will be no splashing of Young's name across the front page of his local newspaper, however. He has avoided the issue by contributing his own fees, although the taxpayer is paying for a member of Northamptonshire's corporate support unit to complete the course. \"I have been paying my own fees,\" says Young, \"although I did receive some help from the university and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. We decided the officer from corporate support would benefit so we agreed the authority would pay his fees.\" Robert Stanfield is paying out of his own pocket the whole of the \u00a315,000 which the three-year course will cost him, while Ch Supt Turbitt's fees are being paid by his employers. The students seem to think that whatever the cost it is worth it. As Young says: \"The MPA is a revelation for anyone involved in public service. Initially I was sceptical but the cross fertilisation of ideas will reap fantastic benefits for everyone on the course.\" The syllabus consists of nine compulsory one-week modules on key themes such as leadership and strategic, financial and information management, the management of people and/or organisational change. Each student has to select four additional modules from a long list, including options to study European public policy in Brussels, global and US public policy in Washington DC, and leadership and innovation in governance and public services at Harvard University. These overseas modules are co-taught by Warwick academics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
