And I cannot argue. They certainly do not buy the Observer for those reasons, they do not buy the Observer at all, they just go to the website and attack it in a state of fury \u2013 usually because they feel cheated, having been led there after an unfortunate coincidence between their initial Google search terms and a news story about a sex scandal or the German rubber industry. Nevertheless, I am sure there will be some among those reading the papery version, playing out the traditional scene, turning the rustly pages over the coffee cups, wife reading the sports section while she mows the lawn, who also feel that Jordan and Peter are no fit subject for grown-ups. Modern nonsense! That is some people's opinion. We know it as soon as we mutter: \"I can't believe they have split up\" \u2013 meaning either that we genuinely can't believe it and are waiting for the next stage of this latest PR wheeze or that we are sorry at the news and hope this likable couple will sort out their problems. Inevitably, we face disapproval for our response. \"Trivial mindset of the Big Brother generation!\" shriek our self-appointed betters. \"Brainless 21st-century obsession with celebrity affairs! Twaddle and piffle! Garage flowers for Diana! Liverpudlian sentiment! Morons in the jungle, drooling magazines, phone votes, Susan Boyle, YouTube if you want to, suspending Parliament just because the kid died! What rot! Bit of national service would sort all this out. Porridge, cold showers and regular beating with a stick.\" But they are wrong, these shriekers, quite wrong. For this is a tale as old as time. Jordan and Peter are our Bible figures, our epic characters, our Greek gods (in Peter's buff case, almost literally). Like Zeus and Athena, Apollo and Aphrodite, they pursue lives of relentless narrative. There is always a wedding, a divorce, an emigration, a birth, a damaged child, a fight, a revenge, a reunion, a sudden new career as a showjumper. This week's OK! magazine could easily reveal that they broke up because Peter took the form of a swan and raped a king's wife, or Jordan ran off to spend six months as Hades's consort in the underworld. It is all a myth \u2013 not a fiction, nor \"reality\", but a myth. We believe some parts, disbelieve others, read metaphorically, analyse meanings and always need the story. Normal people get very little done. How long have you been reading that paper while your wife mows the lawn? Three hours? In that space of time, Jordan and Peter could have set up a new home in Dubai, suffered a miscarriage, discovered that one of them was adopted, met the biological parents and found that they were convicted murderers, rejected them, forgiven them and thrown a vast family Christmas party on the Riviera, all filmed for ITV2 (with thanks to Asda for the Christmas trees, \u00a312). Meanwhile, in the time it takes them to get married, divorced and remarried, we barely manage to change a light bulb or clean the fridge. And yet, within these impossible overblown storylines, we spot emotions that we recognise: jealousy, lust, fear, hope, rage, pride, disappointment. We can't all be sucking these from between the lines of a John Updike novel. Sometimes, we need to see them played out on a pantomime scale, around a bizarre mythic plot, in order to understand them, and ourselves. And we always have. Hail the conkering hero? Never Those who consider an interest in the Jordan-Peter storyline to be sentimental claptrap will no doubt have nodded sagely along with John Gibson, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, when he warned their annual Manchester conference about the dangers of children living \"virtual lives\" on computers rather than learning important life skills \"through games such as conkers\". Yes! Conkers! Small boys banging their nuts together in the playground! Competition! Fair play! Cold weather! Bring back national service! But, in order to believe that children were better trained for life when they spent their time outdoors rather than in, you would need to believe that today's adults have made an excellent fist of things. You would have to look around and see justice, restraint, understanding, fair sharing of resources and a calm, well-ordered world. You would also need to have forgotten the nightmares of childhood. Every outdoor game, from organised football to ad hoc hopscotch, was an opportunity for all but the beefiest thugs to be laughed at, left out and made to feel like idiots. Those games were daily exercises in rejection, humiliation and every sort of pain. I say it crippled us. I say the ruination of the world lies in the savagery of childhood \"socialising\". After all, those who grew up to take part in government were certainly the ones who got picked last for the team, wore glasses and feigned illness on sports day. And just look at them today, snatching revenge! If children had a free choice to spend their break times online, tapping little hellos to other shy or fat or bespectacled or terrified children (ie all children) in faraway places, I am sure they would grow up happier and, therefore, kinder. Even at 28, ahem, I have been happier since I joined \"the Twitter community\". I mean, just look at this mess. The internet's potential to create a global fraternity \u2013 for adults as well as children to understand that people are the same all over the world, and talk to them \u2013 is our only hope of salvation. www.victoriacoren.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
