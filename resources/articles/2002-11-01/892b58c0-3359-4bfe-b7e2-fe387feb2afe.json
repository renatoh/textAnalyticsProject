While England decide whether to keep faith with Matthew Hoggard, who averages 82 a wicket in his past four Tests, Australia may continue to ignore the world's fastest bowler when they pick their team for Adelaide. Brett Lee's place in the side is dependent on the fitness of Jason Gillespie, but the signs were yesterday that the South Australian would overcome the effects of a long-term calf strain in time to face England, leaving Lee to carry the drinks once more. \"He's very keen to play so I expect Jason to be right,\" said Australia's captain Steve Waugh. \"He's recovered from these things before.\" Lee, who was dropped for the first time in his career for the first Test to accommodate Andy Bichel, has responded by taking 21 wickets for New South Wales in two first-class matches since. Bichel performed competently at the Gabba - he took two for 74 in the first innings and was not called upon in the second as England were bowled out for 79 in 28.2 overs - and looks like holding on to his place for the second Test. If Hoggard is dropped he can only blame himself. He is experiencing the worst crisis of his career after taking nought for 164 during the first Test in Brisbane, where he became a particular favourite of the Australian opener Matthew Hayden. Hoggard's punishment in Brisbane added to the bruises he collected during the summer against India and left him with only seven wickets from his past four Tests at a strike rate of one wicket every 23 overs. Alex Tudor and Stephen Harmison were selected ahead of him for the three-day game at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart but both failed to make a favourable impression as Australia A declared on 350 for three despite batting first on a poor pitch. Tudor and Harmison's inability to grasp their opportunity has given Hoggard renewed hope of playing at the Adelaide Oval, where Australia have not lost a Test since the Ashes defeat of 1994-95. The Australian management ruled against Gillespie playing grade cricket at the weekend and he will have to come through a rigorous training session at the Adelaide Oval before being passed fit to play in his home city. \"He is continuing to improve and we decided to hold him back from playing grade cricket because we felt that we didn't want to undo any good that he's gained through the week,\" said Australia's physio Errol Alcott. \"He's demonstrated that he can bowl all right but it's just that he felt a little tight. He wasn't feeling any pain or anything untoward.\" The Adelaide Oval nets will be the venue for Gillespie and Hoggard's attempts to stave off competition for their Test places. The difference is that England do not have the same range of alternatives as their opponents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
