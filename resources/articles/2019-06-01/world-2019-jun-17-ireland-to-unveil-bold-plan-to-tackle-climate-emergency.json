The government published a long-awaited report on Monday outlining more than 180 measures to curb the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It envisages a rise in carbon taxes, a multibillion-euro scheme to retro-fit houses, almost a million electric vehicles and a number of other measures to change behaviour by institutions, companies and individuals. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cWe are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase, and how food is produced. Above all, we are going to decouple emissions growth from economic growth \u2026 This plan represents the sum of our hopes for the future.\u201d Ireland is one of the European Union\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and is facing fines of more than \u20ac250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy. Trends in agriculture and transport mean that emissions are set to continue rising in the next few years, risking even steeper fines for missing 2030 goals and raising questions over if and how Ireland will make its bold plan a reality. The Fine Gael-led centre-right government is entering a general election cycle and is wary of alienating poorer and rural voters with higher carbon taxes \u2013 the trigger for France\u2019s yellow-vest protests. However, support for Ireland\u2019s Green party surged in local and European elections last month, reflecting growing concern over the climate crisis. The Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown drew on a report published earlier this year by an all-party committee. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action, said it put Ireland on a \u201ctrajectory\u201d to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a significantly bolder ambition than the previous commitment to reduce emissions by 80% \u2013 but it is an aspiration, not a binding target. The report also commits Ireland to 2030 EU goals \u2013 to avert fines estimated at \u20ac6bn, it must slash emissions from 60m to 33m tonnes \u2013 by planting more trees and buying carbon credits from other countries. Other goals include: Boost the use of renewable sources for power generation from 30% to 70% of electricity. New onshore and offshore wind turbines are expected to replace peat- and coal-powered power stations. Pave the way for 950,000 electric vehicles by expanding charging networks and banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Retrofit 500,000 homes and 400,000 heat pumps to make buildings more energy-efficient, offering householders \u201ceasy payback methods\u201d. Oil and gas boilers will be prohibited in new homes by 2025. Eliminate non-recyclable plastic and ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds. The central strategy involves increasing carbon taxes from \u20ac20 to \u20ac80 per tonne by 2030 \u2013 a politically fraught exercise that will require cushioning poor people and rural dwellers from higher fuel and heating prices. Another measure targets financial services: pension providers will have to disclose whether they hold fossil fuel assets, giving pension-holders the option to switch providers. Leftwing parties, including Sinn F\u00e8in, have opposed a carbon tax increase, while farmers have assailed Varadkar for saying he is trying to eat less meat to reduce his carbon footprint. Protesters greeted him last month with the chant: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef, you vegan?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
