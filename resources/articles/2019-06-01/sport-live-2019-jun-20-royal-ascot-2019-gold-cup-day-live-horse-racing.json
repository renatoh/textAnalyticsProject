That was one of the great Royal Ascot days of all-time. Frankie Dettori is a master of his craft and racing is going to miss him once he\u2019s gone. But it won\u2019t be for some years yet as he needs the thrill that the sport gives him and this will have encouraged him to stay around for longer. Tomorrow will be an anti-climax, in fact that goes for the rest of the Flat season. Anyway, we\u2019ll be back here for the last two days of the meeting ... see you then. 1 South Pacific (J A Heffernan) 22-1 2 Constantinople (R L Moore) 11-2 3 Eminence (W M Lordan) 25-1 4 Persian Moon (F Norton) 33-1 16 ran Also: 7-2 Fav Questionare Non Runners: 13,16,4 And they\u2019re off ... Sir Ron Priestly leads and Frankie is last on Questionare ... Majestic dawn is in second ... Persian Moon comes there and South Pacific comes fast and late to win for a one-two-three for Aidan O\u2019Brien. Relief washed through the Ascot betting ring as Frankie Dettori and Turgenev were overhauled close home by the 28-1 shot Biometric. Among the most relieved was Robert Speechley, taking bets as Posh Bookmakers, who owns the S&amp;D Bookmakers firm that has 10 shops around Peterborough. \u201cThe liabilities in those shops [if Dettori had kept winning] was a quarter of a million pounds,\u201d Speechley said. \u201cIt was massive, massive to get him beat. I can hardly get the words out. I thought he\u2019d won a distance.\u201d But the ring was eerily quiet in the five minutes before the Britannia began, with no visible sign of panic, because the huge change since Dettori\u2019s magnificent seven in 1996 is the advent of betting exchanges. The high street bookmaking firms sent boatloads of cash to the track in 1996 to shorten the odds of Dettori\u2019s mounts but the belief now is that that action goes straight online. While the Italian\u2019s fans were cleaning up, some of the bookies here were still turning a profit. \u201cYears ago, all the off-course bookmakers would be running for cover,\u201d said Geoff Banks, standing in the middle of Ascot\u2019s front line of bookies and speaking before Turgenev\u2019s defeat. \u201cBut they don\u2019t lay multiples any more. Otherwise, there\u2019s no chance Stradivarius would have gone off at even money, it would have been 4-7 or something like that. \u201cThese days, they\u2019re not laying the multiples, they\u2019re playing the exchanges, and everybody that\u2019s here, they\u2019re all casual investors. \u201cI don\u2019t see the firms playing at all. Many years ago, my father [John Banks, also a bookmaker] said the biggest touch he ever had was not to be here on Frankie\u2019s big day. He was in America and that must have saved him everything. He said he would have stood the last winner, Fujiyama Crest, for the maximum, it had no chance on form. The house, my schooling, everything would have gone. \u201cToday, there seems to be no alarm. It wont be dramatic here because on Ladies Day, the wagering is a lot smaller. The other days, we\u2019re taking some proper bets, \u00a340,000 to \u00a31,000 each-way. We\u2019ve had some \u00a3500s and \u00a31,000s, so it\u2019s been OK. But today, a lot smaller. \u201cStradivarius came up a winner on my book, even though I was 6-5 at the off. All the casual customers here, good luck to them, but they want bigger odds. An even-money chance, what\u2019s that to them? It\u2019s not even odds they understand.\u201d Frankie could still ride five winners. Fred Archer (the \u2018Tin Man\u2019) was the only previous rider in 1878 to ride a five-timer at Royal Ascot. Sinjaari \u2013 9/2 Sir Ron Priestley \u2013 5/1 Questionnaire \u2013 6/1 Constantinople \u2013 7/1 Good Birthday \u2013 12/1 Fox Premier \u2013 14/1 Babbos Boy \u2013 18/1 Majestic Dawn \u2013 22/1 Summer Moon \u2013 20/1 Almania \u2013 20/1 Persian Moon \u2013 40/1 Severance \u2013 28/1 Antilles \u2013 40/1 Eminence \u2013 40/1 South Pacific \u2013 28/1 Leroy Leroy \u2013 66/1 Kuwait Currency \u2013 125/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Do we not like Harry Bentley. Frankie looked to have that won on Turgenev and what a ride he gave that horse. It\u2019s such a shame but the game goes on and Dettori rides Quesionare in the last race of the day. O\u2019Brien evidently feels Constantinople is leniently treated, since this return to handicapping is a surprising move after the colt won the Gallinule. He has plenty more to offer and the extra quarter-mile promises to help. A wide draw has not been the disadvantage one might expect in past runnings of this race, possibly because those on the rail get in each other\u2019s way early on. Sinjaari is progressive and went close in the London Gold Cup, often a strong contest. Sir Ron Priestley is unbeaten in two this year and was at one stage being considered for a Group Two contest rather than this handicap; it looks as though connections feel his rating is still lenient and one can easily imagine why, in light of his comfortable wins. 1 Biometric (Harry Bentley) 28-1 2 Turgenev (L Dettori) 7-2 Fav 3 Fanaar (Dane O\u2019Neill) 50-1 4 Awe (K McEvoy) 14-1 28 ran Non Runners: 5,16,26,24 And they\u2019re off ...

He ran on into a never-nearer second in a Listed contest at The Curragh last time, sparking memories of the same stable\u2019s Son Of Rest, winner of the Ayr Gold Cup a week after being a never-nearer second in a Group One. Migration has an obvious chance on the strength of his strong-finishing success at Newmarket and this course promises to suit him even better, but the betting market is well aware of his claims. The ground must be a worry for King Ademar, who was a non-runner because of soft ground here in May. Motafaawit looks the right type, having beaten a subsequent winner to score here last time. Richard Hannon\u2019s runner is unbeaten in two since a gelding operation. Here is Chris Cook\u2019s report on Frankie Dettori day at Royal Ascot Willie Mullins is not here at Royal Ascot to see his horses run this week and the owner Rich Ricci has just told ITV the trainer has had surgery, details unspecified. \u201cThere was no serious cause of it but, like the rest of us, we\u2019re getting older and need a little maintenance. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d 1 Stradivarius (L Dettori) Evens Fav 2 Dee Ex Bee (S De Sousa) 7-2 3 Master Of Reality (W M Lordan) 66-1 11 ran Also: 4-1 Cross Counter 4th And they\u2019re off ...

He can\u2019t get through ... here comes Stradivarius and leads to win for a Frankie four-timer!!!! Bookies running for cover reports our Greg Wood ... Go on Frankie! There was a slightly awkward scene next to the prize-giving podium after the Ribblesdale, as the winning trainer, John Gosden, and Star Catcher\u2019s groom, Lin Thompson, evidently expected there would be some sort of trophy for the winning groom. In fact, prizes are only handed out to grooms here after the Group One races, but that policy could usefully be reviewed. Increasingly, it\u2019s clear that racing\u2019s audience expects grooms to be recognised when their charges win major races. We see this on social media, when viewers protest about grooms not being able to lead their horses into the winner\u2019s enclosure if the owner wishes to do that by themselves. In fairness to Ascot, names of grooms are presented next to the runners in racecards throughout the Royal meeting. Stradivarius \u2013 11/10 Cross Counter \u2013 4/1 Dee Ex Bee \u2013 9/2 Flag of Honour \u2013 14/1 Called to the Bar \u2013 16/1 Capri \u2013 22/1 Thomas Hobson \u2013 22/1 Magic Circle \u2013 28/1 Raymond Tusk \u2013 40/1 Master of Reality \u2013 80/1 Cyprus Creek \u2013 80/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Stradivarius is looking well to take Frankie Dettori into Ascot history again in the Gold Cup. Simon Clare of Ladbrokes-Coral is taking cover. The odds are shortening. Frankie Dettori\u2019s mount Stradivarius is odds-on for the Gold Cup now that the jockey has ridden the first three winners and Turgenev, his mount in the 5.00, is 13-2 from 12-1 in the last hour. The bookies are very worried. According to Oddschecker, British bookmakers are set for a monster \u00a3180m payout if Frankie Dettori can complete the perfect day at Royal Ascot and go through the card. Oddschecker spokesperson Callum Wilson: \u201cFrankie Dettori is showing why he is one of the most revered flat jockeys in history as he looks to go through the card at Royal Ascot in a feat that would write him into folklore. His popularity means recreational punters will have chanced their arms on the man on fire and bookies are taking evasive action on his last three rides of the day.\u201d It\u2019s all Frankie! It\u2019s building ... Some interesting new opponents line up against Stradivarius, suggesting the chestnut is still seen as beatable in some quarters. This is hard to fathom. As he has shown repeatedly over the last two years, he is an exceptional stayer and can prove it with a second success in Royal Ascot\u2019s feature race. Versatile as to ground and increasingly hard to outbattle, Stradivarius has the right men around him to make the most of his exuberant talent, in John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. He can outclass Cross Counter, whose globetrotting exploits, while impressive, still leave him something to prove here. When last seen in Britain, the Godolphin horse was beaten in a Group Two, though he did have Dee Ex Bee four lengths behind on his previous start. Dee Ex Bee has made a good start to his career in marathons but the form of his wins doesn\u2019t entitle him to take this. Flag Of Honour might be more of a threat, bearing in mind he got within three lengths of Stradivarius last year when just a three-year-old. 1 Star Catcher (L Dettori) 4-1 2 Fleeting (R L Moore) 7-4 Fav 3 Sparkle Roll (Oisin Murphy) 11-1 11 ran Also: 9-2 Queen Power 4th And they\u2019re off ...

This will be more of a test and it\u2019s by no means clear that she\u2019ll thrive on it. Queen Power did well at Newbury to overhaul talented rivals who had first run off a steady pace and the well-bred filly can prove hard to beat. The inexperienced Frankellina might be best avoided by anyone who\u2019s had enough of backing horses that don\u2019t start this week, as she was very slowly away when second in the Musidora. She seemed beaten on merit when sixth in the Oaks but perhaps she has more to offer three weeks down the line. John Gosden fields four but the pick of them, Star Catcher, seems held on her third to Queen Power last time. Frankie Dettori has not been leading jockey at Ascot since 2004 but he has not ridden better and has Stradivarius to come in the Ascot Gold Cup. 1 Sangarius (L Dettori) 13-2 2 Fox Chairman (S De Sousa) 7-2 Fav 3 King Ottokar (James Doyle) 5-1 13 ran Also: 25-1 Eightsome Reel 4th Non Runners: 2,10 And they\u2019re off ...

Aidan O\u2019Brien had a rough time of it on Wednesday, with three consecutive beaten favourites, but Cape Of Good Hope can steer the Irishman back towards the winner\u2019s enclosure. His plugging-on fourth in the French Derby was a bit dour but reads well in this company and, as a brother to Highland Reel, he should have plenty of improvement in him. Headman has become a non-runner because of the rain-softened ground but that won\u2019t be a problem for King Ottokar, who won in the Newbury mud in April, beating Dancing Willoughby, the Queen\u2019s Vase winner on Wednesday. He may not have stayed in the Chester Vase and this return to 10 furlongs could help, though it\u2019ll be a stiff 10 furlongs. Fox Chairman was also beaten at Chester, in the Dee Stakes, when he didn\u2019t get a clear run but seemed to me to lack a bit of tactical speed. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s as short as 4-1. Sangarius was third to King Of Comedy last time, which is strong form, but his pedigree isn\u2019t crying out that he wants 10 furlongs on soft and he hung badly last time. Great Scot won\u2019t stay unless he learns to settle and is a risk in this atmosphere. Cap Francais went close behind Cape Of Good Hope at Epsom but seemed to regress at Lingfield, albeit that race was won by the subsequent Derby winner. 1 A\u2019ali (L Dettori) 5-1 2 Ventura Rebel (P Hanagan) 16-1 3 Dubai Station (J P Spencer) 14-1 14 ran Also: 13-8 Fav Sunday Sovereign, 50-1 Strive For Glory 4th Non Runner: 8 And they\u2019re off ...

Pink was the favourite but after witnessing a run of bets on grey/silver at 12/1, alarm bells rang. It was clearly the right decision to pull the plug with the grey gamble landing this afternoon.\u201d Sunday Sovereign \u2013 13/8 Aali \u2013 6/1 Mount Fuji \u2013 8/1 Air Force Jet \u2013 8/1 Expressionist - 12/1 Ventura Rebel \u2013 14/1 King Neptune \u2013 20/1 Misty Grey \u2013 20/1 Real Appeal \u2013 28/1 Dubai Station \u2013 33/1 Strive for Glory \u2013 66/1 Firepower \u2013 80/1 Emten \u2013 80/1 Cool Sphere \u2013 150/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here Billy Lee had a dismal experience in the Queen Mary, when Ickworth refused to start, but hopefully Sunday Sovereign can brighten the Irishman\u2019s week. The colt has improved in leaps and bounds and inflicted the only defeat so far in the career of Arizona, winner of the Coventry Stakes on Tuesday. There are some unexposed rivals ranged against him but he sets a high bar. Wesley Ward runs Maven, described as having worked \u201clights out\u201d at Kempton last week. He was offered for sale at an auction on Monday but was bought back by the owner at \u00a3725,000 and now has the chance to win 8% of that. A\u2019Ali was beaten favourite on his only start so far but the winner had the benefit of a previous run and it was nine lengths back to the third at Ripon that day. Frankie Dettori climbs aboard. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s runner is Mount Fuji, a half-brother to a Group One-winning juvenile. He overcame greenness to win on his debut but will have to be a lot more savvy here. The French raider Real Appeal has strong form, plenty of speed and was sold for \u00a3265,000 on Monday. It\u2019s slightly surprising that he\u2019s drifted from 12s to 20-1. The royals went for a coordinated look, with the Queen, Duchess of Cambridge, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall all arriving in varying shades of blue. Could the royals be entering a blue period? William and Kate have form on this front, having gone for a blue theme on several of their Christmas cards. Examples of \u201cgroup dressing\u201d also extended outside the Royal Enclosure, with several groups opting for yellow \u2013 aka the shade of the summer and \u201cthe left-field hit of the spring catwalk shows\u201d, which featured at Erdem and Givenchy, Moschino and Oscar de la Renta, to name just a few. The novelty of jumpsuits, first permitted by Ascot in 2017, also appears to have worn off, with the majority women opting for dresses and skirts instead. Yet there were fewer full-length dresses than one might have expected in a year when the prairie dress has reigned supreme, considering that, at the stricter end of Ascot\u2019s dress code, hemlines are required to be \u201cof modest length defined as falling just above the knee or longer\u201d. Tulle \u2013 the material dubbed by this paper as \u201cthe first major trend of 2019\u201d \u2013 did get a look in however, appearing on the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s Elie Saab gown, amongst others. As always, the hats have been a focus, providing an ample platform for the literal dressing trend favoured by Melania Trump on her recent trip to the UK. Horses, the Union Jack, bees and even a floral arrangement spelling out the word \u2018Ascot\u2019 all featured this year, along with a hat comprised of a stack of hats, as worn by model Jodie Kidd. Poppies were another recurring motif \u2013 and black and red a popular colour combo for men and women \u2013 cropping up on both hats and dresses in what could well be a nod to the 75th Anniversary of The D-Day landings, which was commemorated earlier this month. Royal Ascot is always as much about what is seen and happens off the track as it is on. And Ladies\u2019 day is the most important day of the week in that regard. Let our fashion expert be your guide ... After a rainy start to Ascot, Ladies\u2019 day brought the sunshine \u2013 and the fashion. Gone were the plastic ponchos \u2013 but if florals for spring aren\u2019t exactly \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, neither is the prominence pink on Ladies\u2019 day. Pink pom-poms adorned oversize hats, alongside pastel pink hair, and almost-fluro pink dresses \u2013 a carryover from this year\u2019s Oscars celebrations perhaps, where bright pinks ruled the red-carpet.

But just look at those prices! That train strike has been a damp squib Royal Ascot 2019 is the first at which detailed sectional timing \u2013 information about how fast the horses are going at every stage of the race \u2013 is being supplied after every race, something that has been standard practice at several of the world\u2019s other major tracks for some years. Sectionals offer what can seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering array of numbers, offering insight only to a punter with a first in advanced mathematics. What the numbers reveal on closer inspection, however, is the underlying rhythm of a race. How strong was the pace? Was it even throughout? Was the runner-up given too much to do? Sectionals offer answers to these questions and more, all of which can be of considerable assistance when attempting to back future winners. Despite this, though, there are those who remain unconvinced about the need for such information to be made widely available to punters \u2013 including, oddly, some who make a living from \u2026 making information available to punters. Bruce Millington, the former editor of the Racing Post no less, suggested as much in a recent column, claiming that \u201ca better ambition would be to present existing data in a way that will appeal to a new generation of punters, but that will rely more on clever use of symbols, colours and user experiences than by smearing even more numbers across a card.\u201d Simon Rowlands, a leading advocate for sectionals, responded for the defence here and punters who like to think for themselves can find a more general guide to the data and its uses here. Race-by-race data can be found via the results section on the At The Races website \u2013 look for the \u201cSectionals PDF\u201d link at the bottom of the result. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another jockey in Britain or Ireland who gets second-guessed as much as Ryan Moore; it comes with the territory, when you\u2019re first jockey at Ballydoyle. He\u2019s had a fruitful week but his critics were still out in force after he was well beaten on Norway, 11-4 favourite for Wednesday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Vase. Looking at the replay again this morning, I think he was the victim of circumstance to a large extent. On the short run to the first bend, a row of three horses went past on his outside, heading for the front of the field, and you can almost see him thinking: \u2018Hold on, they\u2019re about to go a bit quick here.\u2019 On a horse whose stamina was not assured, he understandably opted to settle out the back. What happens next but those horses, having reached the front, slam on the brakes and it becomes a steady pace all the way down to Swinley Bottom. The first three at that point remained in the first three all the way to the line. With half a mile to go, Norway was obviously in an impossible position, though it has to be said he still didn\u2019t finish like a horse who could have done a lot better behind a stronger pace. It was a frustrating experience for his backers but I don\u2019t blame Moore for what happened. Fashion is front and centre today and I can recall when the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street. But they did appear at race meetings \u2013 at Epsom at the 1991 Derby and at Royal Ascot in 2000. Blue \u2018won\u2019 the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes on Tuesday and Wednesday so will the Queen pull off the greatest shock of all by wearing a blue hat in this now traditional daily betting heat for the third day running? Ladbrokes opened their betting like this: Pink 2/1, Yellow 3/1, Green 3/1, Purple 6/1, Red 8/1, Orange 10/1, Cream/White 10/1, Silver 12/1, Gold 14/1, Blue 16/1, Brown 20/1, Black 50/1, Union Jack 500/1. However, it appears the layers are running scared and they have suspended betting. Ladbrokes have had a big run on pink. Nicola McGeady, the firm\u2019s spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe have suspended our betting. The shrewd money was on silver/grey which was the early gamble. Pink was also very popular and due to the volume of bets we feel someone knows somethign we don\u2019t.\u201d A spokesperson for bookmakers.tv said: \u201cDespite bookies having reportedly their best ever day in the Queen\u2019s hat betting history on Wednesday, firms have battened down the hatches for Ladies\u2019 day. Pink, yellow and even silver/grey have all been reported as favourites. As a result, odds compilers are taking no risks on punters fighting back from their worst run of hat betting in recent memory.\u201d bettingexpert have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005. Pink and blue have made up 57% of her choices on the Tuesday in that time, while pink has also featured most on the Wednesday and Thursday of the five-day meeting. Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week. Aidan O\u2019Brien 3 wins William Haggas 2 Andrew Balding 1 Charlie Hills 1 Sir Michael Stoute 1 Mark Johnston 1 Ian Williams 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 O\u2019Brien is well on his way to being top trainer here for the 10th time, as Haggas just can\u2019t match him for firepower over the final three days here. John Gosden has yet to score, a situation he hopes to correct in today\u2019s Gold Cup with Stradivarius. Wesley Ward is 0/4 so far but Kimari went close for him in the Queen Mary and the American has five more shots at Ascot glory this year. Ryan Moore 3 wins Danny Tudhope 3 Frankie Dettori 2 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Moore was beaten on three consecutive favourites on Wednesday but still bagged the final race to hold onto his position at the top of this table, underlining the quantity of good material he gets to work with. He\u2019s ahead by dint of his three second places, while Tudhope has none of those, but then Tudhope has achieved his three wins from just five rides and that surely is the greater achievement. Of course, Tudhope isn\u2019t even at Ascot today, he\u2019s chasing easier meat at Ripon, which is why he\u2019s an 8-1 shot to come out on top by Saturday evening, odds that do not look generous. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the third day. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Norfolk Stakes Sunday Sovereign 9-4 3.05 Hampton Court Stakes Cape Of Good Hope 6-1 3.40 Ribblesdale Stakes Queen Power 100-30 4.20 Gold Cup Stradivarius 5-4 5.00 Britannia Handicap Eclipse Storm (nap) 40-1 5.35 King George V Handicap Constantinople 9-2 Nothing remarkable about five of those but the elephant in this room is the 40-1 nap. Sometimes \u201cnap\u201d represents great confidence. On this occasion, it stands for my sense that this is a potential winner at a really big price. Is Eclipse Storm the most likely winner in the race? I wouldn\u2019t argue that. But there\u2019s easily enough encouragement in his background to think he could be in the shake-up and it\u2019ll be some thrill if it pans out that way. Saturday\u2019s big race, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, looks a stormer after the news this morning that Blue Point has been declared to run again, having won the King\u2019s Stand here on Tuesday. He will try to become just the second horse to do the double, following the extraordinary performances by the Australian raider Choisir in 2003. Blue Point evidently loves Ascot, having won four times from five races here, and Charlie Appleby reports him in the form of his life, which explains why they\u2019ve opted to roll the dice with him. Also making a quick reappearance in the race is Le Brivido, who didn\u2019t quite get home when fifth in the Queen Anne on Tuesday. Aidan O\u2019Brien clearly thinks he might have enough speed to make a classy sprinter.

After two consecutive days when the forecast rainfall for Ascot was barely on nodding terms with the drenching actuality, it is probably unwise to point out that the prospects for Ladies\u2019 Day, featuring the Gold Cup at 4.20, are much more promising. But you can only deal with the forecasts put in front of you and there is genuine hope of a dry afternoon on the biggest day of the week at the Royal meeting. That would be good news for anyone with an expensive outfit to protect from the elements. Whether it is quite as much of a positive for the punters remains to be seen. Ascot\u2019s ground drains more freely than it did in the past but it still has a reputation for turning a bit gluey as it does so and Stradivarius, last year\u2019s winner and the favourite for the Gold Cup, is the most obvious example of a horse that might not find it entirely to his liking. The latest going report from the course has just dropped on Twitter and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reports that \u201cthe going this morning is now soft, good-to-soft in places\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s actually been dry since racing yesterday, but we did have 10mm of rain during racing yesterday afternoon. The forecast is better for today, it\u2019s due to stay largely dry, with a risk of an occasional sharp shower this afternoon. \u201cThere\u2019s a decent breeze blowing up the track at the moment so we may see an improvement in the conditions as the day goes on. The forecast for the rest of the week is largely dry, with a reduced risk of showers for Friday and Saturday.\u201d It was good-to-soft when John Gosden\u2019s magnificent chestnut took the stayers\u2019 race on Champions Day last October, becoming the first Gold Cup winner for half a century to go unbeaten through all season. That, though, was a Group Two and his best form is all on good-to-firm ground. It is certainly something for punters to think about ahead of today\u2019s race and it looks like they already are, with Stradivarius out to 6-4 from a price of 6-5 overnight. The strength of this year\u2019s opposition may also have something to do with that, as he faces up to last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup winner in Cross Counter and also Mark Johnston\u2019s Dee Ex Bee, who was within two lengths of winning the Derby when he finished second to Masar at Epsom last June. Capri, the 2017 St Leger winner, adds further quality to the line-up, bringing form that includes a three-and-a-quarter length fifth behind Enable in last season\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe. Stradivarius will still start as one of the shorter favourites of the week, and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle after his fine double yesterday, the success, or otherwise, of the Gold Cup favourite is likely to a defining moment in the week-long battle between bookies and punters. The Oaks third Fleeting, in the Ribblesdale Stakes, and Pat Twomey\u2019s exciting Irish two-year-old Sunday Sovereign, a recent purchase by the King Power Racing operation to run in the opening Norfolk Stakes, will be other big fancies today but Stradivarius is the one that really matters. Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the day are here and the action gets under way at 2.30pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
