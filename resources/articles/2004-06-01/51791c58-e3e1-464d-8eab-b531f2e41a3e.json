The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed today that it would not be taking any action following an investigation that has dragged on for more than four years. Morgan, who was sacked as editor of the Mirror last month, today welcomed the decision. \"I have today been notified by the DTI that I have been completely cleared of any wrongdoing in respect of the City Slickers affair,\" he said. \"I cooperated fully with the DTI during this painstaking four-year investigation and always believed that my name would be cleared - and indeed it now has. I may be unemployed, but I am not a crook.\" Sources close to Morgan said he viewed it as the \"irony of ironies\" to have been cleared so shortly after he was sacked for publishing fake photographs purporting to show British soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners. The maverick editor was strongly criticised after he bought \u00a320,000 worth of shares in a computer company, Viglen, the day before the paper's City Slickers column tipped the firm. The column's writers, James Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul, were fired from the Mirror in February 2000 amid allegations that they used their column to ramp the prices of shares they owned before selling them. But Morgan always claimed not to have known in advance that Viglen would be tipped, and donated his profits to charity after the scandal broke. Morgan was criticised by the Press Complaints Commission for failing to impose financial journalism guidelines on his staff, and for selling shares shortly after they had been tipped in the column. The DTI launched an immediate investigation and conducted a series of interviews with Mirror staff including Morgan and Bhoyrul, but Hipwell was never interviewed and the investigation appeared to have ground to a halt. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
