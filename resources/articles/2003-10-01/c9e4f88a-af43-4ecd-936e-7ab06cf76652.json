Just over 24 hours ago I was sunning myself in sunny Greece. Now I'm stuck in a deserted office (er no, the Guardian doesn't send us to watch the game). Still, here's hoping for a decent match. Speaking of which, good news for United and England: Paul Scholes is back. But can he puncture a defence that hasn't conceded a Bundesliga goal all season? 1 After a rousing rendition of Stuttgart's hymn - accompanied by lots of scarf-waving - then the Uefa-sanctioned hymn, we're off! \"Nice boudoir near Stuttgart in Boeblingen on Calwer St 33,\" says Jon. \"Tell Karlsruhe Katharina I said 'Hi'\" Erm, this is the Guardian's website, Jon, not the Readers' Wives. 3 It's a fantastic atmosphere at the moment, lots of singing and whistling and excitement. Can the game match it? 6 No real pattern to the play as of yet, the surface is as slick as a gigolo's chat-up line but both teams aren't really stringing much together. \"Do you, Dan, Barry etc moonlight as comedians?\" says Mark Manley, whom I'm guessing is a comedian himself. \"I think you guys are hilarious, you should go on the road.\" Where we'd be pelted every night with broken bottles, no doubt, Mark. 10 Forgive the delay: classic technical gremlins I'm afraid. If it's any consolation, you haven't missed much - only one shot from Stuttgart's Imre Szabics, which was blocked by Silvestre. 13 United are getting into the game now; the waspish Giggs cuts inside before floating a cross which drifts ten-foot over Van Nistelrooy's head. 17 Slowly, ever so slowly, United are taking control. Van Nistelrooy has just gone on what lazy commentators would call a trademark solo run, but his Lenny Henry-punchline weak shot was easily saved. 19 Email intermission. \"Here's hoping the PLC take a right kicking;\" says the not-at-all-biased Matthew Higginson. \"I'm reading you as the national broadcaster in Hungary somehow allowed the Champs League to slip through its fingers and I'm too tight to pay for cable. Oh and I'm having a glass of wine and some chicken thighs. Er, that's it I suppose - oh, say hello to Andy WIlson (the rugby league man) if you see him, we went to school together.\" Lovely bloke, Matthew - just got married too. 22 More United pressure as Van Nistelrooy flashes a header just wide. \"Does nobody at the Grauniad test the systems before you start?\" fumes TL from Fiskdale MA. \" I'd have thought you'd have plenty of technical boffins who were forced to stay home fixing stuff while you sun yourself in grease.\" Sadly TL, they were too busy playing Advance Dungeon and Dragons while watching their Lord of the Rings (special edition) and eating Cool Blue Doritos. 24 It's a curious game at the moment: Stuttgart are sitting back, like an away side, hoping to counter on the break - and it nearly works as Szabics, totally unmarked, has a header which he puts wide. Best chance of the game so far. 27 Incredible scenes on the terraces: the Stuttgart fans are standing and singing what sounds like John Denver's \"Country Roads\". Which is another way of saying not much is happening on the pitch. \"I've just flicked through German TV and this match isn't being shown,\" says Alisdair Gray. \"Instead, there seems to be a programme about prawns.\" 30 Shock of the night? Chelsea are 2-0 down at home to Besiktas. 32 Stuttgart, buoyed no doubt by the earlier John Denver rendition, are charging forward, and are looking the more dangerous: still, neither keeper has been tested yet. \"Just thought I would ask where Liverpool are playing today,\" barbs Kevin Brady, who seems to believe, erroneously, that I'm a Reds supporter. 36 More Stuttgart pressure. Sadly, for I've wagered heavily on the Germans (at an irrestible 3-1) their two dangerous free-kicks, like most people's lives, come to nothing. 39 It might be a dull game - lots of sparring, neither team overcomitting etc,. etc - but the Stuttgart fans are certainly livening it up. A perfectly in tune \"Que Sera Sera\" has just hummed around the stadium - each and every fan holding their scarves proudly in the air. 41 More caution as we approach half-time. At the moment this has 0-0 or 1-0 written all over it. \"John Denver? Que Sera Sera?\" Who said Germans had no taste\" asks Tariq Choudry. 42 Just a thought: Germans do have taste, right? 44 Stuttgart are definitely having the better of it now, Szabic's 20-yarder bring a decent-but-comfortable save from Tim Howard. \"The country roads song is being sung by United fans,\" explains Trys. \"It goes: Take me home, United road, To the place I belong, To Old Trafford, To see United, Take me home, United road.\" So now you know. 45 Ryan Giggs takes an age to line up a corner. Finally, as he runs up to take it the referee blows his whistle. Cue much laughter from Stuttgart fans and an customarily angry protest from Roy Keane as the teams leave the pitch. Half-time Intermission \"Instead of reading your update, I'll be in a room full of boring ignorant morons (ie Americans),\" says Paul. \"Can you do me a favour and give a shout-out (that's NYC lingo), to my main dude Tiggy, who is over in Milwaukee and tell him he is losing 3-0. He will know what you mean.\" Is this what it's come to? A once-promising career reduced to giving out \"shouts\" to people called Tiggy in Milwaukee? What? Eh? Oh. 46 We're off again. Let's hope the game, like the Oakland Raiders Superbowl prospects, don't crash and burn. Incidentally Mark would like to point out that, \"Contrary to the report you got, they are showing the match in Germany - it's on SAT1.\" 48Drama! Howard comes for a corner and flaps like a James. He misses it completely - but fortunately for United Scholes (on the back post) headers it clear. 50: GOAL! Stuttgart 1-0 Manchester United! Neville misses a header on half-way, then Ferdinand is fooled by Kevin Kuranyi's off-the-ball run - and suddenly Imre Szabics is in! He takes his shot early and slots it past Howard from 20 yards with the touch of green blaize legend Fred Davis in his prime. 52 GOAL! Stuttgart 2-0 Manchester United! Incredible! O'Shea doesn't get a tackle in, allowing Szabics to feed Kuranyi. Howard comes out, but the German international flicks it over him, onto the bar, and in. Cue craziness from the Stuttgart supporters! 55 The camera pans to Sir Alex Ferguson. He's chewing gum furiously in a clockwise direction, looking like he wants to shoot someone. 57 A delay in play as Kuranyi gets treatment. To your emails. 'United road! To the place I belong!' Has it really come to this?\" asks Justin Kavanagh. \"The prawn sandwich brigade must have started a travelling roadshow. Makes you long for the heady days of football humour of Euro 1988 when one could buy an \"Ireland on tour\" T-shirt listing matches in Schuttered (where the choir are tonight), Hangover (delete the g - are you still with me?) and Belch'n'burpin (where this year's Champions League Final is, I believe).\" Indeed it does, Justin. 59 United get a free-kick in Beckham territory, 25 yards out. Ronaldo flicks a blonde streak out of his hair, and steps up: but he's no Beckham, not yet anyway - and his shot is straight into Timo Hildebrand's hands. 61 Stuttgart are sitting back again, happy to absorb United's unconvincing attacks, and looking mighty dangerous on the break. Ferguson's side are looking 2am-at-the-disco desperate now. 64 United sub: Fortune on, O'Shea off. Gary Neville has just picked up a booking. 66 Penalty to United! Giggs slides a ball across the face of the goal, Scholes somehow hits the post from about two yards and Ronaldo - who is shielding the ball from Hildebrand makes a comical dive. The referee hasn't bought it has he? No. Surely not. No. No. No. Wait. He has - yes, it's a penalty to United. Incredible. Van Nistelrooy steps up... 67 ... and thumps it home, straight down the middle. Stuttgart 2 - 1 Manchester United. 71 Stuttgart sub: Lahm off, Gerber on. 73 Just as United look like laying siege to the Stuttgart goal, the Germans fast-break. From deep inside his own half Vranjes goes on a mazy run, before slipping it through to Kuranyi. Silvestre manages to get a foot in - but his deflection takes it wide of Howard, and millimetres wide of his post. 75 Stuttgart sub: Vranjes offf, Tiffert on. 77 Stuttgart have 10 men behind the ball; inviting United to over-press. It nearly works as Silvestre loses the ball and suddenly the Germans have a four on three. They can't take advantage though: Hleb's cross is blocked for a corner, which comes to nothing. 79 Penalty Stuttgart! Admittedly, it's a theatrical dive from Kuranyi - but in fairness the sliding Rio Ferdinand did go right through him. Meira steps up.... 80 ... and Howard saves brilliantly to his left! He was miles off his line though; if it had been a Premiership match it wouldn't been retaken. [minute-by-minute shuffles nervously, his bet on a Stuttgart win is looking precarious]. 82 Yellow card for Tiffert for upending Fortune on the edge of the box. The Germans are rocking, their fans are nervous, and you wouldn't back against United levelling here. 83 United sub: Ferdinand, who was injured in the penalty lunge, off - Forlan on. 84 And Forlan's first touch? A shank off the shin near the Stuttgart corner flag. Goal kick. 86 You'd expect United to be piling forward, sturm und drag style, but it's not happening yet. In fact more defensive sloppiness from Silvestre means they concede another corner. 87 Stuttgart sub: Hleb, who's been excellent off, Meissner on. Stuttgart have a free-kick in a decent position. Can they do something with it? 88 Er, no: Kuranyi's effort flies high over Howard's bar. Immediately United break amd Forlan forces a great save from Hildebrand. Corner! 89 The ball pings around the penalty box before, after lots of hacking and blocking and general panickry, Stuttgart finally clear. Meanwhile the referee's assistant signals four minutes of injury time. 90+1 It's all United now. They're launching long balls forward but Stuttgart's defence is holding. Meanwhile Panathiniakos have just equalised against Rangers, it's 1-1 in Athens. \"$50 United will tie,\" cries Foaud Batlouni. You're on Fouad! 90+4 That's it, it's over! Sir Alex Ferguson, his face like claret, spits out his chewing gum and storms onto the pitch. Meanwhile the Stuttgart players, crowd, ballboys and just about everyone else goes wild. As does your minute-by-minute commentator, having won his easiest $50 ever and a tidy sum from the bookies. Thanks for all your emails, Cheers Sean.
