The 2007 Cheltenham Gold Cup hero was always travelling smoothly for Ruby Walsh, who brought him to overtake long-time Knight Legend before the second-last. The 2-5 favourite, trained by Paul Nicholls, jumped the final fence in great style and bounded away from Light On The Broom with Knight Legend third. The Listener was fourth while Turpin Green unseated his rider three out. Knight Legend set the pace with Daryl Jacob content to have The Listener in second place, ahead of Turpin Green and Kauto Star in fourth. There was no change in the order until the fourth-last where The Listener made a bad blunder. Although he stayed on his feet his chance had effectively gone and that allowed Kauto Star to move sweetly up to the leader and go on when he wanted and win by 11 lengths. The impressive display saw Kauto Star cut for the totesport Cheltenham Gold Cup to 7-2 from 4-1 with VC Bet, with William Hill going 5-2 from 7-2, and Paddy Power 3-1 from 4s. For the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day, Kauto Star was trimmed to 11-10 from 5-4 with VC Bet, 8-11 from evens with Hills, and Paddy Power going evens from 6-4. Kauto Star's owner Clive Smith was a happy man afterwards. He said: \"He just floated over the fences. He was magnificent today and Ruby was thrilled with him. We are very excited and will go to Haydock in three weeks' time for the Betfair Chase.\" Nicholls said: \"That was an awesome performance. He's been doing everything right at home and he did a piece of work with Twist Magic three weeks ago that made us think we could run him in anything. He had some hard races last year but he has bounced back. Today has taken nothing out him and all being well he'll be safe and sound for three weeks' time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
