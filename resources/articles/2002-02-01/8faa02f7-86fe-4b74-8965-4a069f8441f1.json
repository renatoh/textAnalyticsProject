On the main street every other shop is selling tickets for one activity or another. Not tempted by bungy? How about a skydive? Scared of heights? Why not try a shotover jet that turns 360-degrees as it shoots through canyons? Too active? Then there's always the cable car up the side of the hill that overlooks Queenstown. Feeling daring? Take the ski-lift a little higher and try the luge, a three-wheeled go-kart that speeds down a track on the side of the hill. Didn't like the cable car? Try getting down another way. Parapenting perhaps? Strap yourself to an instructor and jump. The parachute is already open so no worries there as you float down to the centre of town. Queenstown, quiet during the day as people go about their business of throwing themselves off of bridges, jetting through rapids and jumping from planes, comes to life at night as they return, having survived the day, with huge grins on their faces. The smile should be the symbol of Queenstown. That self-satisfied \"I did it!\" grin that comes just before you are accosted by a random stranger in a bar who wants nothing other than to tell you what they did that day. Cries of \"I was terrified but I did it!\" \"I tell you what, I'm not doing that again,\" and \"bloody brilliant!\" echo round the bars and clubs of the town. Bungy jumping is particularly popular here. The choice is enormous. Should jumpers choose the Nevis bungy, the tallest in New Zealand at 134m, or the Ledge bungy, reached by cable car? Or perhaps they should go for the baby at only 43m, the Kawarau Bridge bungy, the world's first. Or if you can't decide, there's always the thrillogy, allowing you to do all three in one day. At the Kawarau bridge I watched as, one after another, people hurled themselves over the side with their ankles bound together, attached to an elastic cord. \"Wahey!\" shouted the crowd as each person jumped. \"Aaaaargh!\" shouted the jumpers. And was I imagining it, or was there a slight whisper of disappointment as each jumper safely boinged back up and then was released from their harness? The crowd - or perhaps it was just me - seemed to be waiting for the rope to snap, or extend too far, vindicating our own fear and decision not to do it. \"It all seems awfully safe,\" the woman next to me said. By answering three riddles correctly I won a package from my bus driver entitling me to a free video and photo of me jumping if I decided to do a bungy myself. As I had absolutely no intention of doing so, however safe it seemed, I gave my prize away to Emer. \"I'm going to jump, I'm going to jump, I'm going to jump!\" said Emer. \"No I'm not,\" she said. Five minutes later, Emer decided to jump. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\" said Emer as she went over. Becky works for AJ Hackett, the company that operates several of the bungy sites. \"Have you done it yourself?\" I asked, referring to the Nevis. \"No,\" said Becky, \"it makes me feel seasick\". Not for me, either, the bungy jump. Why jump off a bridge when, for the same money, you can run off the side of a mountain, I thought. So it was a quick phonecall to the tandem hang-gliding instructor and there I was, driving up to Coronet Peak. \"There're two important things to remember,\" said Ricky. \"Keep running until we leave the ground, and hold on to me the whole time.\" As Ricky was six foot four, a foot taller than me, running while holding onto the straps on his shoulders proved a little difficult. But there was no time to think about that. The wind blew, Ricky said \"Run!\" and then wheeeeeeeeeee, we were flying. Hang-gliding is how I imagine it must feel to be a bird. And not just a pigeon or a sparrow. Ricky and I were hawks, swooping round the sky, catching thermals, ducking and diving. \"I used to be a builder,\" said Ricky. \"But I often cycled here and saw people hang-gliding and thought, why not?\" Wheeeeeeeee. We shot up and then quickly down again, zooming past hidden waterfalls and over treetops. As we went in to land we passed over the heads of several sheep, happily ignoring us. I got out of my harness, shook Ricky's hand, and headed back to town with a grin on my face, looking for strangers to tell about my day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
