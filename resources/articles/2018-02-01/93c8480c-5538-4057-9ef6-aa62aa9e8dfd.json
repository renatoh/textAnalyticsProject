Hours earlier, staff had woken to news that in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake a senior colleague had paid women for sex and that Oxfam had known as much when it dismissed him and allowed him to go on to work for other aid agencies. The backlash was intense, and suddenly Oxfam\u2019s future \u2013 and that of its \u00a334m UK government funding \u2013 seemed in doubt. Long-serving staff who gathered to hear Goldring, and others around the world who joined via a Facebook feed, were reeling. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any warning for ordinary staff members,\u201d said one. \u201cOn Friday in the office everyone was really shocked. It was awful.\u201d But deep disgust at what they were hearing was tinged with a sense of inevitability for some. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked with people who\u2019ve worked in Ethiopia, DRC, Haiti, Malawi, Thailand etc who\u2019ve seen similar things across the entire sector,\u201d said one Oxfam worker in the Middle East. Goldring, admired by staff as \u201cdeeply thoughtful\u201d, set out the story \u2013 first a chronology of what happened in Haiti in 2011, and then a commentary on the issues it raised, including pointing out the dilemmas that the Oxfam staff handling the case faced. For example, he said, the charity didn\u2019t report it to the Haitian police because it was concerned that could rebound adversely on the women involved. He struck one attendee as \u201cdesperately keen to put across the point that we don\u2019t think there was a cover-up because we didn\u2019t hide that there was a problem in Haiti\u201d. Only Oxfam hadn\u2019t been open about what that problem was. Some staff also felt there was a \u201csingle-mindedness about the attack on Oxfam\u201d that was not commensurate with the weight of what had happened in 2011. It was shocking and wrong, but some felt that the problems revealed were probably not unique to Oxfam. \u201cI\u2019m really frustrated at the Oxfam-only lens in this \u2013 granted what happened was horrific,\u201d said one Oxfam worker abroad. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for [several other NGOs] and there just isn\u2019t any type of policy or procedure in place for any of this stuff.\u201d Goldring told his staff he had established a senior team to handle the scandal and said: \u201cEverybody else, please try to do your job. I know it\u2019s distressing and difficult but the world doesn\u2019t stop and we have crises to deal with\u201d. But on Saturday and Sunday, as the news got worse and the government\u2019s response more severe, the extent of the threat to Oxfam became clear. \u201cWe are fearful of what\u2019s next,\u201d said one staffer. When Haiti\u2019s ambassador to London voiced his country\u2019s \u201coutcry over those serious crimes that were not reported to relevant authorities\u201d, Oxfam scrambled to contact the Haitian embassy in Bloomsbury and arranged to meet diplomats this week. Emails defending the organisation flooded in. One read: \u201cThis is shameful and completely unacceptable behaviour by a handful of staff and is not representative of the majority who are committed to and demonstrate our strong Oxfam values.\u201d \u201cI really care about Oxfam\u2019s reputation,\u201d said one staff member. \u201cBeing trusted by the British public is so important and if we are not we won\u2019t be able to raise as much money and do all the good things we need to do around the world. People are saddened and it seems to be becoming a bigger story every day.\u201d Sunday\u2019s papers brought claims that Oxfam staff used prostitutes in Chad and data from Oxfam\u2019s own annual report resurfaced showing it dealt with 87 allegations of sexual abuse by staff in 2016-17. Some were pleased that the aid sector was getting its own #MeToo moment \u2013 a long-awaited reckoning similar to those seen in politics and entertainment. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we saw a higher rate of reports, investigations and independent accountability mechanisms present in the sector,\u201d one said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we break the stigma and the silence, and allow victims to report incidents.\u201d When the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Oxfam\u2019s behaviour was a \u201ccomplete betrayal\u201d it was clear the charity\u2019s relationship with the government was at risk. Senior figures set aside weekend plans in a scramble to prepare for what looks set to be a make-or-break meeting with the government on Monday. Caroline Thompson, the chair of Oxfam\u2019s trustees, drafted a statement restating that the behaviour in Haiti was \u201ccompletely outside our values and should never be tolerated\u201d. It set out in detail steps they plan to take to strengthen the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. \u201cLast year we got \u00a334m from the UK government and the previous year it was \u00a350m,\u201d said one senior figure. \u201cWe are in a challenging funding context with the UK government and then you throw this into the mix and it does create concern.\u201d There is also a fear the furore could be exploited politically by Oxfam\u2019s enemies. Last month Oxfam released a report claiming the \u201crichest 1% bagged 82% of wealth created last year while the poorest half of humanity got nothing\u201d. This prompted Rob Wilson, the former charities minister, to describe Oxfam as \u201ca front group for extreme leftwing Corbynistas\u201d. The grave mistake over Haiti has put the charity, founded in 1942, in a perilous situation. \u201cPeople are trying to reconcile what they know about Oxfam today with a story from seven years ago,\u201d said one staff member. \u201cThe vast majority of people at Oxfam are very dedicated and get on with their work and would be the first to raise questions about behaviour like this. \u201cSo, it is hard to wake up one morning and see this is how their organisation is being painted, when they know the vast majority of people aren\u2019t like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
