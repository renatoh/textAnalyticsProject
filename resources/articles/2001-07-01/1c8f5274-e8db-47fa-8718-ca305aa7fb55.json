Hussain fractured the little finger on his left hand when struck by a ball from Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie. He will miss the second Test, at Lord's beginning on Thursday week, and faces a struggle to be ready for the third Test at Trent Bridge two weeks later. \"The advice we have had from the specialist is that the fracture is stable and Nasser's finger will be in a splint until next Monday,\" England's physiotherapist Dean Conway explained. \"He should be able to start mobilising the joint thereafter but the specialist's initial thoughts are that he will be out of cricket for around three weeks.\" A replacement captain will named this week but Alec Stewart, who took over this season against Pakistan while Hussain was recovering from a broken thumb, ruled himself out of the running today. \"I wouldn't take the job back if it was offered,\" he told CricInfo. \"I think it's time to move on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
