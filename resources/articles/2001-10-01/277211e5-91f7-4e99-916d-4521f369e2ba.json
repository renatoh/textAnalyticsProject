The conference, organised by Business in the Environment, reported that recent research showed 13% of company investor relations managers believed environmental and social issues were important. But only 3% of analysts, 4% of institutional investors and 3% of financial journalists thought the subjects mattered. The study also showed that although investor relations managers believed they were communicating effectively on environmental and social issues, their audience failed to agree. The aim of the conference in London was to bridge that gap and to illustrate the revolution that was taking place. Dr Belinda Howell, director of Business in the Environment, said: \"The City doesn't want raw statistical data on environmental performance. It wants to know what this data says about quality of management, risk of exposure, level of liability - and how the company is performing against its competitors. \"But information provided often depends on what is available internally, rather than what external audiences want to know. \"Business in the Community and Business in the Environment are helping companies identify relevant issues. \"Today, past financial performance is acknowledged to be less of an indicator of future performance than it used to be. \"The wide range of stakeholders interested in financial, social and environmental issues now in many companies, includes employees who are also shareholders and customers. Effective reporting is an issue for the many not the few. \"Our aim is to help ensure that effort is rewarded right across the corporate responsibility agenda by helping bridge the communication gap between business and the City.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
