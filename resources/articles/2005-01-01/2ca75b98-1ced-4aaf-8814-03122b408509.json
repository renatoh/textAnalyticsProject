Born Moniek Kroskof in Lodz, Poland, he was sent to live at the age of six with his aunt in Breslau, Germany, to escape anti-semitism. He thrived in and adored Germany - the language always remained his favourite - but fled to France as a student when Hitler became German chancellor. He studied philology at the university of Bordeaux and became fluent in French. The last time he returned to Poland to visit his family was in 1937. He never saw them again; they all died in Auschwitz. He moved to Vienna and enrolled as a student in the university. But as a Polish-born Jew, he was made stateless in 1938, when Austria was swallowed by Germany in the Anschluss. He returned to France and lived in Nice, where he worked to help Jews obtain forged papers. Arrested by the Vichy government, he was put into a concentration camp in the foothills of the Pyrenees. He spent two years in concentration, slave labour and deportation camps in France, and was tortured by the Milice, the French Gestapo. He escaped and joined the Resistance, where he took a nom de guerre, Michel Thomas. While working to recruit members in Lyon in 1943, he stumbled into an early raid by Klaus Barbie and the Gestapo. He was personally interrogated by the Butcher of Lyon, but his fluent French and feigned ignorance of German fooled Barbie, who believed the story that Thomas was an artist selling drawings, and let him go. Thomas testified against Barbie at his 1987 trial in Lyon for crimes against humanity, where he was sentenced to life in prison. After the encounter, Lyon became too dangerous, and the Resistance sent Thomas to fight in the Alps. In 1944, after the liberation of Grenoble, he joined the advancing GIs of the US Army's 45th Division, the Thunderbirds. He fought in an American uniform with the 180th regiment, where his language skills and local knowledge made him valuable in combat intelligence. He was nominated for a Silver Star for bravery during the battle of Autrey, where he led patrols in enemy territory at grave personal risk. Later in 1944, after the US Army went into Germany, he worked with the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), where his language skills and Resistance contacts were useful. As a CIC agent, he entered Dachau concentration camp the day it was liberated. Because of information from the interrogation of crematorium workers, Emil Mahl, \"the hangman of Dachau\", was captured in Munich and convicted of war crimes. In the last week of the war, Thomas had a tip about an SS truck convoy on the road near Munich. It was tracked to a paper mill in the town of Freimann, where the troops dumped a mountain of paper to be pulped. Thomas realised that he had discovered a critical cache of Nazi documents, including identity cards, complete with pictures, of the entire party membership. These became the prize of the Berlin Document Center, and crucial to the Nuremberg war crimes trials and post-war denazification of West Germany. Thomas, stationed with CIC in Ulm, Germany, for two years after the war, captured and interrogated SS Major Gustav Knittel, wanted for the murder of unarmed US PoWs during the Battle of the Bulge. He was later convicted of war crimes. Thomas emigrated to the United States in 1947 and founded a language school in Beverly Hills, California. Later, he was based in New York. He slowly developed an effective language-teaching method that led celebrities, ambassadors, academics and corporate chiefs to pay steep fees for a three-day personal course. Students included Woody Allen, Bob Dylan, Princess Grace, Mel Gibson, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Emma Thompson, who said learning Spanish with Thomas was unforgettable - \"the most extraordinary learning experience of my life\". In May 2004, after investigation and recommendations from veterans with whom he fought, former members of the CIC, and Senator John McCain and New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, the US Army granted Thomas the Silver Star, the third highest medal for combat valour. He was awarded this at a ceremony at the new second world war memorial in Washington. Thomas was also recognised at the US Holocaust Memorial in a ceremony honouring the liberators of the camps. Despite a decade of ill health, Thomas never relaxed a work schedule that a 30-year-old would have found punishing. Just before his death, he completed a hectic schedule of travel. He is survived by a daughter and a son, and his former wife, Alice Burns. \u00b7 Michel Thomas (Moniek Kroskof), linguist and teacher, born February 3 1914; died January 8 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
