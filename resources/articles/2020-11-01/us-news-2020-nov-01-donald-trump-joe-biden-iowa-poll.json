As Trump enjoyed the same Iowa lead over Hillary Clinton days before he won the 2016 election with narrow victories in key midwest states, the news could well rattle Democrats anxiously awaiting Tuesday\u2019s decision. In the poll, conducted by Selzer &amp; Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom between 26 and 29 October, Trump led by 48% to 41% for Biden. In September, the same poll showed the two men tied at 47%. Four years ago, Trump won Iowa by 9.4 points. The Selzer poll involved 814 likely voters and had a 3.4% margin-of-error. J Ann Selzer, the polling company\u2019s president, said men and political independents continued to support Trump. \u201cThe president is holding demographic groups that he won in Iowa four years ago, and that would give someone a certain level of comfort with their standing,\u201d Selzer told the Register. \u201cThere\u2019s a consistent story in 2020 to what happened in 2016.\u201d Selzer added that as \u201cneither candidate hits 50%, there\u2019s still some play here\u201d. But she also said data indicated 94% of \u201clikely voters\u201d had decided which way to vote, including 98% of Biden supporters and 95% of Trump supporters, and a mere 4% of likely voters said they were still persuadable. Many Iowa voters have already cast their ballot. As in other states, early and mail-in voting has increased dramatically. More than half of probable voters said they had already cast ballots, the Register reported. Early voting is generally held to favour Biden, with Trump counting on a surge of support on election day itself. Among polling experts, reaction to the Iowa poll was mixed. Nate Silver, of FiveThirtyEight.com, wrote that the survey did not portend a wild swing to Trump across the board. \u201cOne thing to keep in mind if you see late polling movement in a state is whether the movement is in line with fundamentals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn Iowa, for instance, our model thought Trump \u2018should\u2019 have been ahead by three points based on polling in similar states, uniform swing, etc. It\u2019s pretty red. \u201cSo the Selzer poll, which brought our average there from Biden +0.1 to Trump +1.8, about as big a shift as you\u2019ll see, brought the race more in line with the fundamentals there. The same would be true if, say, Biden got a couple of rough polls in Texas tomorrow.\u201d Nate Cohn, of the New York Times, noted that Selzer\u2019s poll was \u201cthe president\u2019s best poll result in a very long time \u2013 perhaps of the election cycle. \u201cIt is also worth noting, though, that Selzer can be wrong, and has been before. No pollster has been put on a higher pedestal, but in the end everyone in this business is subject to sampling error and so on. If you expect perfection \u2026 you won\u2019t get it. \u201cAnd this Selzer Iowa poll is off on its own, not just in Iowa but in terms of the overall story. Every national poll has shown Biden way ahead of Clinton among white voters [and] white working class voters. He\u2019s excelled across the white, northern tier.\u201d Both candidates are still competing for Iowa. Biden held a drive-in rally in Des Moines on Friday and Trump, who was in the state in October, was set to host a rally in Dubuque on Sunday. Nationally, Biden was ahead of Trump 51% to 41% in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. New polls on Sunday also put Biden up nationally and in key battleground states, though races were tightening in Pennsylvania and Florida, two of the most fiercely contested prizes. NBC News showed Biden\u2019s national lead at 10%, down from 11% two weeks ago. CBS News showed Biden up with early voters and Trump relying on an election day surge. A New York Times/Siena College poll put Biden up by 11 points in Wisconsin, six in Arizona and Pennsylvania and three in Florida \u2013 all states which went for Trump in 2016. Trump did not seem concerned. \u201cOur numbers are looking VERY good all over\u201d he tweeted early on Sunday. \u201cSleepy Joe is already beginning to pull out of certain states. The Radical Left is going down!\u201d With two days to go to perhaps the most consequential US election of modern times, there is plenty of scope for nerves on both sides of the partisan divide. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster, insisted the election was \u201creally a referendum on Donald Trump\u201d and said: \u201cThe other thing is that the numbers really have been stable in terms of the [Biden] lead at 10 points now. \u2026 There\u2019s been no movement to really suggest that Donald Trump is making ground.\u201d Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the outcome would come down to states with \u201chuge numbers of white, non-college [voters] who\u2019ve not yet voted\u201d. \u201cAmong the roughly three out of 10 people who say they have not voted yet, they\u2019re voting for Donald Trump by almost 30 points,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Look at the states with huge numbers of white, non-college [voters] who\u2019ve not yet voted: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. And this election is going to come down to those states again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
