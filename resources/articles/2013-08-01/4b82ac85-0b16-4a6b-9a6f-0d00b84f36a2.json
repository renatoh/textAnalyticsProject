I can only assume this is the reason that why, when asked to compare the Liberal candidate for Lindsay Fiona Scott with the previous Liberal seat holder Jackie Kelly, he said they had being \"young\" and \"feisty\" in common. Then, instead of stopping at that safe and fairly benign point, he added, \u201cI can probably say they have a bit of sex appeal\u201d. Oh, Tony. Oh dear, dear Tony. It\u2019s almost as if he is producing his very own election-campaign advent calendar, but instead of a chocolate treat, behind each little door is a gaffe-covered treat for the ALP. The uproar in response to \"sexygate\" (the description currently trending on Twitter because we still creatively add \"gate\" to literally everything) isn\u2019t suggesting that Kelly or Scott don\u2019t have sex appeal. It also isn\u2019t to say that being attractive doesn\u2019t contribute to a politician\u2019s success, no matter how irrelevant it is to their credentials. However, Abbott\u2019s latest comment about a female candidate for office does conform to a demonstrated pattern of using problematic language to describe women. When asked to come up with some positive qualities about a woman he is endorsing to be elected, two of the three words Abbott produced were to do with age or physical qualities \u2013 and the third is debatably even a compliment. And let\u2019s not forget, this was not a comment made by Mr and Mrs Elderly Voter or Mr Young Bearded Voter at the local lawn bowls club while enjoying a cheap pint. The person who commented on Scott\u2019s \"sex appeal\" is essentially her boss. At the very least, he is in a position of power in relation to her. I can\u2019t think of many places where a boss is allowed to comment on an underling\u2019s physical attractiveness without repercussions. Perhaps Abbott has been watching too many episodes of Hugh Hefner\u2019s reality show, because I imagine the offices of Playboy would be one of the only settings to condone this kind of behaviour. It is unequivocally true that if Abbott had been asked a similar question about a male candidate, he would never say: \u201cWell, um, well, Andrew Laming is young, feisty, has great hair and a very nice jawline\u201d. If you are saying something about a female candidate that you would never say about a male candidate, you are treading on dangerous ground in the scary swamp of sexism. Because the terrain is so risky, I have decided to help poor Abbott out. Below I will list several compliments for Abbott to add to his repertoire in case he is ever again in the terrifying situation of having to think of nice things to say about Scott that aren\u2019t about her looks: \"She is intelligent\" Up to this point, Scott has not been caught on camera in an embarrassing interview where she was unable to name the Coalition\u2019s six-points to stop the flow of asylum seekers, while simultaneously holding a copy of the points in her hands. She has also completed a bachelor of business. \"She has good judgement\" Unlike Kelly, Scott has not been involved in a scandal whereby her husband was caught distributing bogus handouts claiming to be from the Islamic Australia Federation in order to scare votes away from a Labor candidate. She also works with local disability groups, providing pro-bono advice and delivering frontline disability services. \"She is successful\" Fiona Scott is a university-educated small-business owner, and is in the running to be elected to the seat of Lindsay. She is what you could call \"a woman of calibre\"\u2026 actually Tony, don\u2019t use that one. Hopefully these tips will go some way toward helping Abbott assuage Australia\u2019s concerns that he may be sexist or misogynist in some way. However, in my very own compliment to the Australian people, I suspect he might not fool them so easily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
