The decision means that all classes and workshops on Friday afternoons will be cancelled from April and inmates will in future spend 23 hours a day locked in their cells from every Friday lunchtime until the following Monday morning. Paul Tidball, president of the Prison Governors' Association, said the introduction of this \"standard core week\" would reduce the average time spent out of cell each week by each inmate to its lowest level for nearly 40 years. \"They are to be locked up for half a day longer to meet savings next year from next April. We will be locking them up for more hours than they were in 1969,\" he told MPs yesterday. The prison governors also told MPs that they feared gang culture would flourish in the three planned \"titan\" jails, to contain 2,500 places each, announced last week. The Commons justice committee also heard Lord Carter, the architect of the new prison building plan, say that he thought two new titan jails were needed for London rather than the one announced, and that the emergency early release scheme to ease overcrowding was likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The MPs examining last week's announcement of a \u00a31.2bn prison building programme also heard the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, testify that all the evidence suggests that small local prisons do better than large prisons. She said the French had abandoned building titan prisons after the population of the first, which was built outside Paris in 1992 to hold 2,800, had swollen to 3,600 overcrowded inmates. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, also put a question mark against the official \u00a31.2bn estimate for the three titan jails announced last week, suggesting she had heard from official sources that the eventual cost could be double that figure. Carter, whose review of the prison system recommended the introduction of the titan jails, defended the supersize prisons, saying they would enable many more prisoners to be housed closer to home and could accommodate five separate grades of inmates within five separate units within their walls. \"I do not advocate a 2,500-place Dartmoor. That would be madness. What we need is prison places closer to where people come from,\" he said, adding that London could do with two titan jails rather than just the one announced last week. But Tidball told MPs that while the titans could enjoy some economies of scale, prison governors, who were not consulted about the proposals, felt \"underwhelmed\" by the case being made for them. \"If it is simply that there is a better chance of getting planning permission next to a Tesco at a motorway intersection that is not reason enough in itself.\" He said there were concerns that gang culture would predominate in larger prisons and warned that it would be difficult to cope with the ripple effect of a riot in one unit spreading across the prison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
