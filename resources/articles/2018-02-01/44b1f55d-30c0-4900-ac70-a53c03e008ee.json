The gorgeous Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie is a West End hit; the young duo behind Six demonstrated real talent with their all-female show; and now Ben Adams and Chris Wilkins\u2019 80s-themed musical arrives with the message that even the despised school geek can end up an unlikely superhero. It also comes with voiceover from Star Wars\u2019s Mark Hamill as Kevin the Robot. Eugene (Liam Forde) is a joke to the cool kids at school. But he has created a comic about a superhero called Tough Man, and when a film producer comes looking for ideas, Eugene is whisked to Hollywood. But will he overcome the machinations of movie mogul Lex (Cameron Blakely), and realise in time that Tough Man\u2019s story is not a figment of his imagination but true? Tough Man\u2019s nemesis, his nerdy evil twin, Lord Hector (Ian Hughes), is on the set with murder on his mind. Silly but amiable, Eugenius! is bursting with 80s pop culture references and boasts infectiously poppy pastiche songs. The Other Palace is designed for new musical tryouts, so Eugenius! is still in minor key: the story requires streamlining, and if it\u2019s going to position itself in the cult musical pantheon between Return to the Forbidden Planet and The Rocky Horror Show, it begs for an injection of snarky wit and subversive camp. But I\u2019ve spent time with far less engaging superheroes, and this would-be musical whizzkid may yet develop the smarts. Eugenius! is at The Other Palace until 3 March.
